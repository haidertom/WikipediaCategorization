'''''Administrative Behavior: a Study of Decision-Making Processes in Administrative Organization''''' is a book written by [[Herbert A. Simon]] (1916–2001). It asserts that "[[Decision making|decision-making]] is the heart of [[Administration of business|administration]], and that the vocabulary of administrative theory must be derived from the logic and psychology of human choice", and it attempts to describe administrative [[organization]]s "in a way that will provide the basis for scientific analysis".&lt;ref name=AB1947&gt;{{cite book | last = Simon | first = Herbert A. | title = Administrative Behavior: a Study of Decision-Making Processes in Administrative Organization | publisher = Macmillan | location = New York | year = 1947 | edition=1st | oclc = 356505}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xiii-xiv}}&lt;ref name=AB1957&gt;{{cite book | last = Simon | first = Herbert A. | title = Administrative Behavior: a Study of Decision-Making Processes in Administrative Organization | publisher = Macmillan | location = New York | year = 1957 | edition=2nd | oclc = 964597}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xlv-xlvi}}&lt;ref name=AB1976&gt;{{cite book | last = Simon | first = Herbert A. | title = Administrative Behavior: a Study of Decision-Making Processes in Administrative Organization | publisher = Free Press | location = New York | year = 1976 | edition=3rd | isbn = 0029289718}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xlvii-xlviii}}&lt;ref name=AB1997&gt;{{cite book | last = Simon | first = Herbert A. | title = Administrative Behavior: a Study of Decision-Making Processes in Administrative Organizations | publisher = Free Press | location = New York | year = 1997 | edition=4th | isbn = 0684835827 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xi}} The first edition was published in 1947; the second, in 1957; the third, in 1976; and the fourth, in 1997. As summarized in a 2001 obituary of Simon, the book "reject[ed] the notion of an omniscient 'economic man' capable of making decisions that bring the greatest benefit possible and substitut[ed] instead the idea of 'administrative man' who '[[Satisficing|satisfices]]—looks for a course of action that is satisfactory'".&lt;ref name=Lewis2001&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Paul|title=Herbert A.

==Background==

The book is based on Simon's doctoral thesis in [[political science]] at the [[University of Chicago]], which he began planning in 1937.&lt;ref name=Simon1991&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Simon | first1 = Herbert A. | title = Models of My Life | year = 1991 | publisher = Basic Books | location = [New York] | isbn = 0465046401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53}} At the time, the chair of the political science department was [[Charles Edward Merriam]].&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|55–63}}

Beginning in 1936, Simon worked as a half-time research assistant and then as a full-time staff member at the [[International City/County Management Association|International City Managers Association]] (ICMA).&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|69–92}}&lt;ref name= Crowther-Heyck2005&gt;{{cite book | last = Crowther-Heyck | first = Hunter | title = Herbert A. Simon: the Bounds of Reason in Modern America | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | location = Baltimore | year = 2005 | isbn = 0801880254 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|76–77,84–87,96–97}} Among other activities at ICMA, he learned about administration and about scientific collaboration from director Clarence Ridley, and published his first book with Ridley in 1938.&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|64,72}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ridley | first1 = Clarence E. | last2 = Simon |first2 = Herbert A. | title = Measuring Municipal Activities: a Survey of Suggested Criteria and Reporting Forms for Appraising Administration | publisher = International City Managers Association | location = Chicago | year = 1938 | oclc = 2049544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Simon cites Ridley as a major influence on his thinking, Simon did not actually work on his thesis while at ICMA.&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|64–65,69–72,74}}

Simon took a position at the [[Institute of Governmental Studies|Bureau of Public Administration]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] between 1939 and 1942.&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|78–85}} It was at Berkeley that he completed his [[University of Chicago]] Ph.D. thesis, which was approved by a committee consisting of [[Leonard D. White]], C.&amp;nbsp;Herman Pritchett, Clarence Ridley, and Charner Marquis Perry.&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|84}} Simon received his doctorate in 1942.&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|84–85}}

==Influences==

In writing his thesis and book, Simon was influenced by ''[[The Functions of the Executive]]'' (1938) by [[Chester I. Barnard]]. In his 1991 [[autobiography]], Simon wrote that he found Barnard's book "wholly superior to the other administrative literature of the day and fully compatible with my preference for looking at management in decision-making terms".&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|73}} The book, which Simon read "with painstaking care", motivated Simon to reflect upon his experiences and to focus on administrative decision making.&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|73–74,86–87}} In a 1988 interview, Simon was quoted as follows:&lt;ref name=Golembiewski1988Interview/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Of course I built squarely on Barnard, and have always felt deeply indebted to him; science is a cumulative endeavor...In the book itself there are fourteen references to Barnard...the notions of the contribution-inducement equilibrium, authority, and zone of acceptance were all derived from Barnard...What I would now regard as the principal novelties in ''Administative'' [sic] ''Behavior'' are the development of the concept of organizational identification...the description of the decision process in terms of the processing of decision premises, and the [[bounded rationality]] notions...Most of the rest is highly "Barnardian", and certainly even those "novel" ideas are in no way inconsistent with Barnard's view of organizations.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mitchell and Scott have noted similarities in Barnard's and Simon's concepts of authority, organizational equilibrium, and decision making.&lt;ref name=MitchellScott1988&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Mitchell |first1= Terence R. |last2= Scott |first2= William G. |date= Fall 1988|title= The Barnard-Simon Contribution: a Vanished Legacy|journal= Public Administration Quarterly|volume=12 |issue=3 |pages= 348–368|jstor=40861427}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|349–352}}&lt;ref name=Mahoney2005&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Mahoney | first1 = Joseph T. | title = Economic Foundations of Strategy | year = 2005 | publisher = SAGE | location = Thousand Oaks, CA | isbn = 1-4129-0543-5 | chapter = Chapter 1: Behavioral Theory of the Firm | pages = 1–53 | url = http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/5029_Mahoney_Chapter_1.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}  For example, Barnard's "zone of indifference" (a subordinate's unquestioned acceptance of authority) became Simon's "zone of acceptance".&lt;ref name=MitchellScott1988/&gt;{{rp|350}}&lt;ref name=Golembiewski1988PartI&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Golembiewski |first1= Robert T. |year= 1988|title= Perspectives on Simon's Administrative Behavior: Stock-Taking on the Fortieth Anniversary – Part I |journal= Public Administration Quarterly |volume=12 |issue= 3|pages=259–382|jstor=40861422}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|266}}  In addition, Mitchell and Scott concluded that both Simon and Barnard believed that large organizations control individuals' behavior and manipulate their opinions.&lt;ref name=MitchellScott1988/&gt;{{rp|357–364}}

Philosophers who influenced Simon include [[William James]], [[John Dewey]], [[A.&amp;nbsp;J. Ayer]], and [[Rudolf Carnap]].&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|45–46,80,82,88,90,93,96,101,186,195,199}}&lt;ref name=Golembiewski1988Interview/&gt;&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|53–54,58–59}}&lt;ref name= Crowther-Heyck2005/&gt;{{rp|99–101}}&lt;ref name=Kerr2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kerr|first1=Gerry|title=The Development History and Philosophical Sources of Herbert Simon's ''Administrative Behavior''|journal=Journal of Management History|volume=13|issue=3|year=2007|pages=255–268|doi=10.1108/17511340710754707}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas of behavioral psychologist [[Edward C. Tolman]] and sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]] also contributed to Simon's work.&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|86,114,190–191}}&lt;ref name= Crowther-Heyck2005/&gt;{{rp|101–105}}  Simon characterized his own philosophical approach as [[logical positivism]].&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|45}}&lt;ref name=Sherwood1990/&gt;{{rp|253}}

==Editions==

===Preliminary (1945)===
In 1945, when Simon was at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], he sent [[mimeograph]]ed copies of a preliminary version of the book (which was similar to his thesis) to about 200 people he thought might be interested in his work.&lt;ref name=Golembiewski1988Interview/&gt;&lt;ref name= Crowther-Heyck2005/&gt;{{rp|130–131}} One of the recipients of the preliminary version was Barnard. Although Simon did not know Barnard personally, Barnard sent a total of 25 pages of detailed comments to Simon, which resulted in a thorough revision of the book.&lt;ref name= Crowther-Heyck2005/&gt;{{rp|131–133}} Simon then asked Barnard to write the book's foreword.&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|88}}

===1st (1947)===
The first edition had 16 pages of [[Book design#Front matter|front matter]] (e.g., a Foreword by Chester Barnard, a Preface, and Acknowledgements), as well as 259 pages of [[Book design#Body matter|body matter]] (i.e., Chapters I-XI) and [[Book design#Back matter|back matter]] (Appendix and Index).&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;

The published first edition was different from the preliminary version in many ways, including:&lt;ref name=Golembiewski1988Interview/&gt;&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|86}}&lt;ref name= Crowther-Heyck2005/&gt;{{rp|133–134}}
* Mathematical appendices and a comparison of rats and humans in organizations was removed
* The chapters were rearranged, with "Some Problems of Administrative Theory" moved up to Chapter&amp;nbsp;II
* Some discussion of [[logical positivism]] was deleted
* There was more discussion of communication within organizations
* Material that could be considered "political" (e.g., passages that appeared to support [[New Deal]] economics) had been taken out

In the Foreword, Barnard states that Simon's conclusions are "consonant with [his] experience" as an executive, and expresses hope that "ultimately it may be possible to state principles of general organization".&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|ix-xii}}&lt;ref name=AB1957/&gt;{{rp|xli-xliv}}&lt;ref name=AB1976/&gt;{{rp|xliiii-xlvi}}  In the Acknowledgements, Simon thanked Barnard for ''The Functions of the Executive'', for "the extremely careful critical review he gave the preliminary version of this book", and for his Foreword.&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|xv-xvi}}&lt;ref name=AB1957/&gt;{{rp|xlvii-xlviii }}&lt;ref name=AB1976/&gt;{{rp|xlix-l}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|xiii}}

===2nd (1957)===
The second edition featured a new Introduction, causing the book to contain 48 pages of front matter and 259 pages of body and back matter.&lt;ref name=AB1957/&gt; The Introduction summarized the book's structure, suggested how practitioners might apply the book's lessons, discussed the concepts of rational behavior and [[satisficing]], commented on specific chapters in the book, and provided recent references.&lt;ref name=AB1957/&gt;{{rp|ix-xxxix}}&lt;ref name=Golembiewski1988Interview/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sent1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sent|first1=Esther-Mirjam|title= Administrative Man Versus/As Economic Man (book review)|journal=Journal of Economic Methodology|volume=6|issue=1|year=1999|pages=133–139|doi=10.1080/13501789900000008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===3rd (1976)===
The third edition, which had 50 pages of front matter and 364 pages of body and back matter, placed the original Chapters I-XI and Appendix into a Part&amp;nbsp;I.&lt;ref name=AB1976/&gt;{{rp|1–253}} Its "Part II" consisted of six new chapters (XII through XVII) based on articles that Simon had written:&lt;ref name=AB1976/&gt;{{rp|ix-x,xiii-xiv,255–356}}&lt;ref name=Kerr2007/&gt;{{rp|256}}&lt;ref name=Sent1999/&gt;

===4th (1997)===
[[File:Administrative Behavior 4th Edition 1997 Cover.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of 4th edition (1997); note change of subtitle to "...Organizations"]]
For the fourth edition, with 15 pages of front matter and 368 pages of body and back matter, the last word in the subtitle was changed from "Organization" to "Organizations".&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt; The fourth edition lacked Barnard's foreword which had been present in the first through third editions.&lt;ref name=Sent1999/&gt; Instead of the third edition's lengthy Introduction and Part&amp;nbsp;II, in the fourth edition the Introduction was briefer and Simon's commentaries followed each chapter of the original text.&lt;ref name=Kerr2007/&gt;{{rp|256}}&lt;ref name=Sent1999/&gt;

==Summaries of Chapters I-XI and Appendix ==
The text and pagination of the 253 pages of Chapters I-XI and of the Appendix ("What Is an Administrative Science?") were the same in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd editions. Although the text of Chapters I-XI and the Appendix was the same in the 4th edition, the pagination was different.

=== Chapter I. Decision-Making and Administrative Organization===
This chapter was based on a 1944 article with the same name in ''Public Administration Review''.&lt;ref name=Simon1944&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simon|first1=Herbert A.|title=Decision-Making and Administrative Organization|journal=Public Administration Review|volume=4|issue=1|year=1944|pages=16–30|doi=10.2307/972435|url= http://shelf1.library.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/tiff2pdf/simon/box00063/fld04779/bdl0001/doc0001/simon.pdf |jstor=972435}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Simon distinguishes between "value judgments" (which "lead toward the selection of final goals") and "factual judgments" (which "involve the implementation of such goals"),&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|4–5}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|4}} a topic which he explores more fully in Chapter&amp;nbsp;III.

Based on a 1946 article in ''Public Administration Review'' entitled "The Proverbs of Administration",&lt;ref name="Simon1946"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simon|first1=Herbert A.|title=The Proverbs of Administration|journal=Public Administration Review|volume=6|issue=1|year=1946|pages=53–67|doi=10.2307/973030|url= http://shelf1.library.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/tiff2pdf/simon/box00063/fld04787/bdl0001/doc0001/simon.pdf|jstor=973030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter&amp;nbsp;II is notable for the following passage near its beginning:&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|20–21}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|29}}&lt;ref name=Banfield1957&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Banfield|first1=Edward C.|title=The Decision-Making Schema|journal=Public Administration Review|volume=17|issue=4|year=1957|pages=278–285|doi=10.2307/973419|jstor=973419}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|279}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a fatal defect of the current principles of administration that, like proverbs, they occur in pairs. For almost every principle one can find an equally plausible and acceptable contradictory principle. Although the two principles of the pair will lead to exactly opposite organizational recommendations, there is nothing in the theory to indicate which is the proper one to apply. To substantiate this criticism, it is necessary to examine briefly some of the leading principles.
# Administrative efficiency is increased by a specialization of the task among the group
# Administrative efficiency is increased by arranging the members of the group in a determinate hierarchy of authority
# Administrative efficiency is increased by limiting the span of control at any point in the hierarchy to a small number
# Administrative efficiency is increased by grouping the workers
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These principles were found in the 1937 book ''Papers on the Science of Administration'' edited by [[Luther Gulick (social scientist)|Luther Gulick]] and [[Lyndall Urwick]].&lt;ref name= Crowther-Heyck2005/&gt;{{rp|97}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Papers on the Science of Administration |editor1-first= Luther |editor1-last= Gulick |editor2-first= L.|editor2-last= Urwick |year=1937 |publisher= Institute of Public Administration, Columbia University|location= New York |oclc=995995|url= https://archive.org/details/papersonscienceo00guli }}&lt;/ref&gt; After pointing out the shortcomings in the four principles, such as ambiguities and lack of empirical evidence, Simon states that "over-all efficiency must be the guiding criterion" in administrative organizations and that scientific methods must be applied to determine how to improve that efficiency.&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|36,42–44}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|43,48–49}}

=== Chapter III. Fact and Value in Decision-Making===
Chapter III "clarifies foundational aspects of the logic of choice."&lt;ref name=Cohen2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Michael D.|title=''Administrative Behavior'': Laying the Foundations for Cyert and March|journal=Organization Science|volume=18|issue=3|year=2007|pages=503–506|doi=10.1287/orsc.1070.0275}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|504}} The first section of the chapter provides details for the explanation in Chapter&amp;nbsp;I of "facts" versus "values". The chapter's second section on "Policy and Administration" discusses how the legislative and executive branches of government apply facts and values.&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|52–59}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|61–67}}

=== Chapter IV. Rationality in Administrative Behavior===
After considering how the ideas of [[Instrumental value|means]] and [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|ends]] relate to decision-making,&lt;ref name=Cohen2007/&gt;{{rp|504}} Simon distinguishes among "objectively", "subjectively", "consciously", "deliberately", "organizationally", and "personally" rational decisions.&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|76–77}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|85}}

=== Chapter V. The Psychology of Administrative Decisions===
In the first part of this chapter, "The Limits of Rationality", Simon wrote:&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|81}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|93–94}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;Actual behavior falls short, in at least three ways, of objective rationality…:
:(1) Rationality requires a complete knowledge and anticipation of the consequences that will follow on each choice. In fact, knowledge of consequences is always fragmentary.
:(2) Since these consequences lie in the future, imagination must supply the lack of experienced feeling in attaching value to them. But values can be only imperfectly anticipated.
:(3) Rationality requires a choice among all possible alternative behaviors. In actual behavior, only a very few of all these possible alternatives ever come to mind.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The remainder of the chapter concerns "Purposive Behavior in the Individual" and "The Integration of Behavior".

=== Chapter VI. The Equilibrium of the Organization===
As summarized by Simon in the 4th edition's "Commentary on Chapter VI", the central idea of this chapter is that "the survival and success of organizations depend on their providing sufficient incentives to their members to secure the contributions that are needed to carry out the organizations' tasks".&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|164}}

=== Chapter VII. The Role of Authority===
Chapters VII-X deal with four ways in which an organization can influence an individual's decisions. In Chapter&amp;nbsp;VII, Simon discusses the nature of authority and how it is used in organizations: for enforcing responsibility, for obtaining decision-making expertise, and for coordinating activity. Four methods are described for avoiding conflicts in authority when a subordinate has multiple superiors.

=== Chapter VIII. Communication===
Simon defines communication as "any process whereby decisional premises are transmitted from one member of an organization to another".&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|154}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|208}} Communication can be formal or informal, may need to be archived to provide "memory" for an organization, and is sometimes accomplished through training. The 4th edition's "Commentary on Chapter&amp;nbsp;VIII" discusses computerized communications which were unavailable in 1947.&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|223–249}}

=== Chapter IX. The Criterion of Efficiency===
This chapter expands upon a concept that had been mentioned briefly in preceding chapters.&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|14,122}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|12,149–150}}  In a for-profit organization, the "criterion of efficiency" states than an individual will select an alternative that will maximize income and minimize cost so as to "yield the greatest net (money) return to the organization".&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|172–173}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|250–251}}  More generally (i.e., to include nonprofit organizations) the criterion causes "''that choice of alternatives which produces the largest result for the given application of resources''."&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|179}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|256}}  In the remainder of the chapter, Simon counters criticisms of the efficiency criterion and outlines methods by which efficiency can be attained (e.g., by "functionalization" and by the public budgeting process).

=== Chapter X. Loyalties and Organizational Identification===
Following a concept of [[Harold Lasswell]], Simon asserts that "''a person identifies himself with a group when, in making a decision, he evaluates the several alternatives of choice in terms of their consequences for the specified group.''"&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|205}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|284}}  Such organizational identification can be associated with decisions that are not optimal in terms of an organization's efficiency or adequacy ("the degree to which its goals have been reached").&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|212}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|290}}

=== Chapter XI. The Anatomy of Organization===
Simon describes the organizational decision-making process and writes:&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|240–241}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|322}}&lt;ref name=Kerr2007/&gt;{{rp|263}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;The need for an administrative theory resides in the fact that there ''are'' practical limits to human rationality, and that these limits are not static, but depend upon the organizational environment in which the individual's decision takes place. The task of administration is so to design this environment that the individual will approach as close as practicable to rationality (judged in terms of the organization's goals) in his decisions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Appendix: What Is an Administrative Science?===
In the final part of the book common to all editions, Simon discusses the "theoretical" (descriptive) aspects and "practical" aspects (i.e., leading toward the improved attainment of objectives) of the science of administration.

==Criticism==
* [[Robert A. Dahl]] wrote in 1947 that a science of organizations was impossible due to cultural differences among organizations.&lt;ref name=Golembiewski1988PartI/&gt;{{rp|263}} Similarly, a 1957 review of the second edition questioned whether scientific studies of important aspects of organizational decision-making "under controlled conditions" could ever be undertaken.&lt;ref name=Banfield1957/&gt; Simon responded to the 1957 review that "as knowledge advances...administrative practice will come to rest largely on scientifically tested knowledge of fundamental underlying mechanisms".&lt;ref name=Simon1958&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simon|first1=Herbert A.|title='The Decision-Making Schema': a Reply|journal=Public Administration Review|volume=18|issue=1|year=1958|pages=60–63|doi=10.2307/973736|url=http://octopus.library.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/tiff2pdf/simon/box00064/fld04871/bdl0001/doc0001/simon.pdf|jstor=973736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Simon does not offer any convincing replacement for the principles of organization that he critiques.&lt;ref name=Golembiewski1988PartI/&gt;{{rp|267}}
* Simon's introductions and commentaries in the second through fourth editions interpret material in the first edition in a way that stretches its meaning or contradicts it.&lt;ref name=Kerr2007/&gt;{{rp|256–257}}  For example, Simon saw "satisficing man" in the 1947 text but other authors saw "maximizing man".&lt;ref name=Golembiewski1988PartI/&gt;{{rp|267}}

==Legacy==

Simon felt that the reviews of the first edition "were generally kind, but the reviewers were not exhilerated [sic]",&lt;ref name=Golembiewski1988Interview/&gt; and that the book "created no sensation" at first.&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|88}}&lt;ref name=Sent1999/&gt;  Nevertheless, it became notable for the following innovations:

In 1978, [[Sune Carlson]] said in a speech at the ceremony awarding Simon a Nobel Prize in Economics:&lt;ref name=Carlson1978/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;…the study of the structure and the decision-making of the firm became an important task in economic science. … In his epoch-making book ''Administrative Behavior'', which first appeared in 1947 and which has been translated into nearly a dozen languages, as well as in a number of subsequent works, Simon describes the company as an adaptive system of physical, personal and social components, which are held together by a network of intercommunications and by the willingness of its members to co-operate and to work towards common goals. …
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Nevertheless, it was reported that economists [[Albert Ando]] and [[William Baumol]] had "made little reference to ''Administrative Behavior''" in arguing to the Nobel Prize Committee that Simon should win.&lt;ref name=Sent1999/&gt;{{rp|138}}

In 1990, Sherwood reported in ''Public Administration Review'' that 19 of 20 members of an informal advisory panel voted ''Administrative Behavior'' one of the "five or six most influential" books in academic [[public administration]] published between 1940 and 1990, making it the "public administration book of the half century."&lt;ref name=Sherwood1990/&gt;{{rp|249}} It was the "overwhelming leader" among the books nominated, receiving "twice as many nominations as any other book."&lt;ref name=Sherwood1990/&gt;{{rp|251,254}} Despite over 150,000 copies of the book having been sold in English, in a small survey of recent graduates from a [[Master of Public Administration]] program, Sherwood found widespread belief in the administrative proverbs that Simon attempted to discredit in Chapter II.&lt;ref name=Sherwood1990/&gt;{{rp|252,254}}

'''Albert Wessels''' (1 October 1908 - 22 July 1991) was a [[South Africa]]n [[industrialist]] and the founder of [[Toyota]] South Africa.

Toyota South Africa can trace its roots back to 1961, when Wessels obtained a permit to import ten ''Toyopet Stout'' [[pickup truck]]s (popularly known as ''[[Pickup truck|bakkies]]'' in South Africa) from [[Japan]]. Toyota products proved to be very popular in South Africa and by 1968 Toyota had become the largest producer of commercial vehicles in the country; in the same year it was also chosen as "company of the year" by the South African financial press.

Albert Wessels was succeeded as [[chief executive officer]] of Toyota South Africa by his son, [[Bert Wessels]], in 1988; Bert also became the company's [[chairman|executive chairman]] on his father's death.

He married the South African poet [[Elisabeth Eybers]] in 1937, but the couple - who had three daughters and a son - divorced in 1961. However, the [[Albert Wessels Trust]] continued to fund the [[Elisabeth Eybers Prize]].

Wessels published an [[autobiography]], ''Farmer to Industrialist'', in 1987.

An '''asset-backed security''' ('''ABS''') is a [[Security (finance)|security]] whose income payments and hence value are derived from and collateralized (or "backed") by a specified pool of underlying [[asset]]s. The pool of assets is typically a group of small and [[illiquid]] assets which are unable to be sold individually. Pooling the assets into financial instruments allows them to be sold to general investors, a process called  [[securitization]], and allows the risk of investing in the underlying assets to be diversified because each security will represent a fraction of the total value of the diverse pool of underlying assets. The pools of underlying assets can include common payments from credit cards, auto loans, and mortgage loans, to esoteric cash flows from aircraft leases, royalty payments and movie revenues.

Often a separate institution, called a [[special purpose vehicle]], is created to handle the securitization of asset backed securities.  The special purpose vehicle, which creates and sells the securities, uses the proceeds of the sale to pay back the bank that created, or originated, the underlying assets.  The special purpose vehicle is responsible for "bundling" the underlying assets into a specified pool that will fit the risk preferences and other needs of investors who might want to buy the securities, for managing credit risk – often by transferring it to an insurance company after paying a premium – and for distributing payments from the securities.  As long as the credit risk of the underlying assets is transferred to another institution, the originating bank removes the value of the underlying assets from its balance sheet and receives cash in return as the asset backed securities are sold, a transaction which can improve its [[credit rating]] and reduce the amount of capital that it needs.  In this case, a credit rating of the asset backed securities would be based only on the assets and liabilities of the special purpose vehicle, and this rating could be higher than if the originating bank issued the securities because the risk of the asset backed securities would no longer be associated with other risks that the originating bank might bear.  A higher credit rating could allow the special purpose vehicle and, by extension, the originating institution to pay a lower interest rate (and hence, charge a higher price) on the asset-backed securities than if the originating institution borrowed funds or issued bonds.

Thus, one incentive for banks to create securitized assets is to remove risky assets from their balance sheet by having another institution assume the credit risk, so that they (the banks) receive cash in return. This allows banks to invest more of their capital in new loans or other assets and possibly have a lower capital requirement.

==Definition==
An "asset-backed security" is sometimes used as an umbrella term for a type of security backed by a pool of assets,&lt;ref&gt;assets  that otherwise could not be traded has been securitized. [http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/10381/2/MPRA_paper_10381.pdfABS MBS and CDO compared: an empirical analysis]&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes for a particular type of that security – one backed by consumer loans&lt;ref name=vink/&gt; or loans, leases or receivables other than real estate.&lt;ref name=investopedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Asset-Backed Security – ABS|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset-backedsecurity.asp|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first case, [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (cdo, securities backed by debt obligations – often other asset-backed securities) and [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (mbs, where the assets are mortgages), are subsets, different kinds of asset-backed securities. (Example: "The capital market in which ''asset-backed securities'' are issued and traded is composed of three main categories: ABS, MBS and CDOs". (italics added)&lt;ref&gt;source: {{cite web|last=Vink|first=Dennis|title=ABS, MBS and CDO compared: an empirical analysis|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/10381/2/MPRA_paper_10381.pdf|work=August 2007|publisher=Munich Personal RePEc Archive|accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  In the second case, an "asset-backed security" – or at least the abbreviation "ABS" – refers to just one of the subsets, one backed by consumer-backed products, and is distinct from a MBS or CDO, (example: "As a rule of thumb, securitization issues backed by mortgages are called MBS, and securitization issues backed by debt obligations are called CDO .... Securitization issues backed by consumer-backed products – car loans, consumer loans and credit cards, among others – are called ''ABS''&lt;ref name=vink&gt;{{cite web|last=Vink|first=Dennis|title=ABS, MBS and CDO compared: an empirical analysis|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/10381/2/MPRA_paper_10381.pdf|work=August 2007|publisher=Munich Personal RePEc Archive|accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also {{cite web|title=What are Asset-Backed Securities?|url=http://www.investinginbonds.com/learnmore.asp?catid=5&amp;subcatid=16&amp;id=10#sthash.roSaSia3.dpuf|publisher=SIFMA|accessdate=13 July 2013|quote=Asset-backed securities, called ABS, are bonds or notes backed by financial assets. Typically these assets consist of receivables other than mortgage loans, such as credit card receivables, auto loans, manufactured-housing contracts and home-equity loans. These are to be constrasted with pre-existing securities-based assets, such as common investor portfolios, which can be liened for securities-based credit lines.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
On January 18, 2005, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ([[United States Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]]) promulgated [[Regulation AB]] which included a final definition of Asset-Backed Securities.&lt;ref name="secruling"&gt;"Financial Services Alert" Goodwin and Procter, January 18th 2005, Vol. 8 NO. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Definition of ABS. The term "asset-backed security" is currently defined in [[Form S-3]] to mean a security that is primarily serviced by the cash flows of a discrete pool of receivables or other financial assets, either fixed or revolving, that by their terms convert into cash within a finite time period plus any rights or other assets designed to assure the servicing or timely distribution of proceeds to the security holders. The SEC has interpreted the phrase "convert into cash by their terms" to exclude most assets that require active behavior to acquire cash – such as the selling of non-performing assets and physical property. It has also interpreted the phrase "discrete pool" to exclude those that can change in composition over time.

:* Lease-Backed Securities. The new rule expands the definition of "asset-backed security" to include lease-backed securities as long as the residual value of the leased property is less than 50% of the original securitized pool balance (or less than 65% in the case of motor vehicle leases). However, such securities may be shelf-registered on Form S-3 only if the residual value of the leased property represents less than 20% of the original securitized pool balance (or less than 65% in the case of motor vehicle leases).

:* Delinquent and Non-performing Assets. The new rules provide that a security may be considered to be an "asset-backed security" even if the underlying asset pool has total delinquencies of up to 50% at the time of the proposed offering as long as the original asset pool does not include any "non-performing" assets. However, consistent with current practice, [[shelf registration]] on [Form S-3] {lacks definition} will be available only if delinquent assets constitute 20% or less of the original asset pool. An asset is considered to be non-performing if it satisfies the charge-off policies of the sponsor (or applicable bank regulatory agencies) or if it would be considered a charged-off asset under the terms of the applicable transaction documents.

:* Exceptions to the "Discrete Pool" Requirement. The new rules generally codify the SEC staff’s position that a security must be backed by a discrete pool of assets in order to be considered an ABS. However, the new rules establish the following exceptions to address market practices.

::(1) Any security issued in a [[Securitization#Master trust|master trust]] structure would meet the definition of "asset-backed security" without limitation.

::(2) "asset-backed securities" will also include securities with a prefunding period of up to one year during which up to 50% of the offering proceeds (or, in the case of master trusts, up to 50% of the aggregate principal balance of the total asset pool whose cash flows support the ABS) may be used for subsequent purchases of pool assets.

::(3) The new rules also include within the definition of "asset-backed security" securities with revolving periods during which new financial assets may be acquired. In the case of revolving assets such as credit cards, dealer floorplan and home equity lines of credit, there is no limit to the length of the revolving period or the amount of new assets that can be purchased during that time. For securities backed by receivables or other financial assets that do not arise under revolving accounts, such as automobile loans and mortgage loans, an unlimited revolving period will be permitted for up to three years. However, the new assets added to the pool during the revolving period must be of the same general character as the original pool assets.

According to [[Thomson Financial League Tables]], US issuance (excluding [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]]) was:
* 2004: USD 857 billion (1,595 issues)
* 2003: USD 581 billion (1,175 issues)

==Types==

===Home equity loans===
Securities collateralized by [[home equity loan]]s (HELs) are currently the largest asset class within the ABS market.  Investors typically refer to HELs as any nonagency loans that do not fit into either the [[jumbo loan|jumbo]] or [[alt-A]] loan categories.  While early HELs were mostly second lien [[subprime lending|subprime]] mortgages, [[first lien|first-lien]] loans now make up the majority of issuance.  Subprime mortgage borrowers have a less than perfect credit history and are required to pay interest rates higher than what would be available to a typical agency borrower.  In addition to first and second-lien loans, other HE loans can consist of high [[loan to value]] (LTV) loans, [[re-performing loans]], scratch and dent loans, or open-ended home equity lines of credit (HELOC),which homeowners use as a method to consolidate debt.&lt;ref name="Dwight"&gt;"Fixed Income Sectors: Asset-Backed Securities: A primer on asset-backed securities", Dwight Asset management Company 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auto loans===
The second largest subsector in the ABS market is auto loans.  Auto finance companies issue securities backed by underlying pools of auto-related loans.  Auto ABS are classified into three categories: prime, nonprime, and subprime:
* Prime auto ABS are collaterized by loans made to borrowers with strong credit histories.
* Nonprime auto ABS consist of loans made to lesser credit quality consumers, which may have higher cumulative losses.
* Subprime borrowers will typically have lower incomes, tainted credited histories, or both.
Owner trusts are the most common structure used when issuing auto loans and allow investors to receive interest and principal on sequential basis.  Deals can also be structured to pay on a pro-rata or combination of the two.&lt;ref name="Dwight"/&gt;

===Credit card receivables===
Securities backed by [[credit card]] receivables have been benchmark for the ABS market since they were first introduced in 1987.  Credit card holders may borrow funds on a revolving basis up to an assigned credit limit.  The borrowers then pay principal and interest as desired, along with the required minimum monthly payments.  Because principal repayment is not scheduled, credit card debt does not have an actual maturity date and is considered a nonamortizing loan.&lt;ref name="Dwight"/&gt;

ABS backed by credit card receivables are issued out of trusts that have evolved over time from discrete trusts to various types of master trusts of which the most common is the de-linked master trust. Discrete trusts consist of a fixed or static pool of receivables that are [[tranche]]d into senior/subordinated bonds.  A master trust has the advantage of offering multiple deals out of the same trust as the number of receivables grows, each of which is entitled to a pro-rata share of all of the receivables.  The delinked structures allow the issuer to separate the senior and subordinate series within a trust and issue them at different points in time. The latter two structures allow investors to benefit from a larger pool of loans made over time rather than one static pool.&lt;ref name="Dwight"/&gt;

===Student loans===
ABS collateralized by [[student loan]]s (“SLABS”) comprise one of the four (along with home equity loans, auto loans and credit card receivables) core asset classes financed through asset-backed securitizations and are a benchmark subsector for most floating rate indices .{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} [[Federal Family Education Loan Program]] (FFELP) loans are the most common form of student loans and are guaranteed by the [[U.S. Department of Education]] ("USDE") at rates ranging from 95%–98% (if the student loan is serviced by a servicer designated as an "exceptional performer" by the USDE the reimbursement rate was up to 100%).{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  As a result, performance (other than high cohort default rates in the late 1980s) has historically been very good and investors rate of return has been excellent.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  The College Cost Reduction and Access Act became effective on October 1, 2007 and significantly changed the economics for FFELP loans; lender special allowance payments were reduced, the exceptional performer designation was revoked, lender insurance rates were reduced, and the lender paid origination fees were doubled.

A second, and faster growing, portion of the student loan market consists of non-FFELP or private student loans. Though borrowing limits on certain types of FFELP loans were slightly increased by the student loan bill referenced above, essentially static borrowing limits for FFELP loans and increasing tuition are driving students to search for alternative lenders.  Students utilize private loans to bridge the gap between amounts that can be borrowed through federal programs and the remaining costs of education.&lt;ref name="Dwight"/&gt;

The [[United States Congress]] created the [[Student Loan Marketing Association]] (Sallie Mae) as a government sponsored enterprise to purchase student loans in the secondary market and to securitize pools of student loans. Since its first issuance in 1995, Sallie Mae is now the major issuer of SLABS and its issues are viewed as the benchmark issues. Although to a few{{to whom|date=March 2018}} this may have been unfair or inflationary, it appeared to have been legitimate.

===Stranded cost utilities===
Rate reduction bonds (RRBs) came about as the result of the [[Energy Policy Act of 1992]], which was designed to increase competition in the US electricity market. To avoid any disruptions while moving from a non-competitive to a competitive market, regulators have allowed utilities to recover certain "transition costs" over a period of time.  These costs are considered nonbypassable and are added to all customer bills. Since consumers usually pay utility bills before any other, chargeoffs have historically been low.  RRBs offerings are typically large enough to create reasonable liquidity in the aftermarket, and average life extension is limited by a "true up" mechanism.&lt;ref name="Dwight"/&gt;
===Others===
There are many other cash-flow-producing assets, including manufactured housing loans, equipment leases and loans, aircraft leases, trade receivables, dealer floor plan loans, securities portfolios, and royalties.&lt;ref name="Dwight"/&gt;  Intangibles are another emerging asset class.&lt;ref name="Intangible Asset Finance"&gt;[[Intangible Asset Finance]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trading asset-backed securities==
"In the United States, the process for issuing asset-backed securities in the primary market is similar to that of issuing other securities, such as corporate bonds, and is governed by the [[Securities Act of 1933]], and the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]], as amended.  Publicly issued asset-backed securities have to satisfy standard SEC registration and disclosure requirements, and have to file periodic financial statements."&lt;ref name="sofabs"&gt;T Sabarwal "Common Structures of Asset-Backed Securities and Their Risks, December 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Process of trading asset-backed securities in the secondary market is similar to that of trading corporate bonds, and also to some extent, mortgage-backed securities.  Most of the trading is done in over-the-counter markets, with telephone quotes on a security basis.  There appear to be no publicly available measures of trading volume, or of number of dealers trading in these securities."&lt;ref name="sofabs"/&gt;

"A survey by the Bond Market Association shows that at the end of 2004, in the United States and Europe there were 74 [[electronic trading platform]]s for trading fixed-income securities and derivatives, with 5 platforms for asset-backed securities in the United States, and 8 in Europe."&lt;ref name="sofabs"/&gt;

"Discussions with market participants show that compared to Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, many asset-backed securities are not liquid, and their prices are not transparent.  This is partly because asset-backed securities are not as standardized as Treasury securities, or even mortgage-backed securities, and investors have to evaluate the different structures, maturity profiles, credit enhancements, and other features of an asset-backed security before trading it."&lt;ref name="sofabs"/&gt;

The "price" of an asset-backed security is usually quoted as a spread to a corresponding swap rate.  For example, the price of a credit card-backed, AAA rated security with a two-year maturity by a benchmark issuer might be quoted at 5 basis points (or less) to the two-year swap rate."&lt;ref name="sofabs"/&gt;

"Indeed, market participants sometimes view the highest-rated credit card and automobile securities as having default risk close to that of the highest-rated mortgage-backed securities, which are reportedly viewed as substitute for the default risk-free Treasury securities."&lt;ref name="sofabs"/&gt;

==Securitization==
{{Main article|Securitization transaction}}
{{See also|Credit enhancement}}
[[Securitization]] is the process of creating asset-backed securities by transferring assets from the issuing company to a bankruptcy remote entity. [[Credit enhancement]] is an integral component of this process as it creates a security that has a higher rating than the issuing company, which allows the issuing company to monetize its assets while paying a lower rate of interest than would be possible via a secured bank loan or debt issuance by the issuing company.

==ABS indices==
{{see also|asset-backed securities index}}
On January 17, 2006, CDS Indexco and [[Markit Group Limited|Markit]] launched ABX.HE, a synthetic asset-backed credit derivative index, with plans to extend the index to other underlying asset types other than home equity loans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.markit.com/marketing/press_releases.php?date=17Jan2006 Markit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ABS indices allow investors to gain broad exposure to the subprime market without holding the actual asset-backed securities.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
A significant advantage of asset-backed securities for loan originators (with associated disadvantages for investors) is that they bring together a pool of financial assets that otherwise could not easily be traded in their existing form. By pooling together a large portfolio of these illiquid assets they can be converted into instruments that may be offered and sold freely in the capital markets. The tranching of these securities into instruments with theoretically different risk/return profiles facilitates marketing of the bonds to investors with different risk appetites and investing time horizons.

Asset backed securities provide originators with the following advantages, each of which directly adds to investor risk:
* Selling these financial assets to the pools reduces their risk-weighted assets and thereby frees up their capital, enabling them to originate still more loans.
* Asset-backed securities lower their risk. In a worst-case scenario where the pool of assets performs very badly, "the owner of ABS (which is either the issuer, or the guarantor, or the re-modeler, or the guarantor of the last resort) might pay the price of bankruptcy rather than the originator." In case the originator or the issuer is made to pay the price of the same, it amounts to re-inventing of the lending practices, restructuring from other profitable avenues of the functioning of the originator as well as the norms of the issuance of the same and consolidation in the form of either merger or benchmarking (internal same sector, external different sector).

This risk is measured and contained by the [[lender of last resort]] from time to time auctions and other Instruments that are used to re-inject the same bad loans held over a longer time duration to the appropriate buyers over a period of time based on the instruments available for the bank to carry out its business as per the business charter or the licensings granted to the specific banks. The risk can also be diversified by using the alternate geographies, or alternate vehicles of investments and alternate division of the bank, depending on the type and magnitude of the risk.

The exposure of these refinanced loans to "bad credit" (Type II) decisions (particularly in the banking sector, unscrupulous lending or the adverse selection of credits) is hedged against by the sellers of the same, or the re-structurers of the same. Thinking of securitization (insurance) as a panacea for all the ills of bad credit decisions might lead to the hedging of the risk by the transfer of the "hot potato" from one issuer to another without the actual asset against which the loan is backed reaching an upswing in value, either by the demand-supply mismatch being addressed or by one of the following factors:
* The economic productivity of the business cycle being reversed from downturn to upturn (monetary and fiscal measures)
* More buyers than sellers in the market
* A breakthrough innovation.
On a day-to-day basis the transferring of the loans from the
* Sub-ordinate debt (freshly made and highly collateralized debt) to the
* Sub-ordinate realizable
* Sub-ordinate non-realizable
Senior as well as bad (securitized) debt might be a better way to distinguish between the assets that might require or be found eligible for re-insurance or write – off or impaired against the assets of the collaterals or is realized as a trade-off of the loan granted against or the addition of goods or services. &lt;br /&gt;
This is totally built up in any bank based on the terms of these deposits, and dynamic updation of the same as regards to the extent of the exposure or bad credit to be faced, as guided by the accounting standards, and adjudged by the financial and non-market (diversifiable) risks, with a contingency for the market (non-diversifiable) risks, for the specified types of the accounting headers as found in the balance sheets or the reporting or recognition (company based declaration of the standards) of the same as short term, long term as well as medium term debt and depreciation standards.

The issuance of the accounting practices and standards as regards to the different holding patterns, adds to the accountability that is sought, in case the problem increases in magnitude.
* The originators earn fees from originating the loans, as well as from servicing the assets throughout their life.
The ability to earn substantial fees from originating and securitizing loans, coupled with the absence of any residual liability, skews the incentives of originators in favor of loan volume rather than loan quality. This is an intrinsic structural flaw in the loan-securitization market that was directly responsible for both the credit bubble of the mid-2000s (decade) as well as the credit crisis, and the concomitant banking crisis, of 2008.

"The financial institutions that originate the loans sell a pool of cashflow-producing assets to a specially created "third party that is called a special-purpose vehicle (SPV)".
The SPV (securitization, credit derivatives, commodity derivative, commercial paper based temporary capital and funding sought for the running, merger activities of the company, external funding in the form of venture capitalists, angel investors etc. being a few of them) is "designed to insulate investors from the credit risk (availability as well as issuance of credit in terms of assessment of bad loans or hedging of the already available good loans as part of the practice) of the originating financial institution".

The SPV then sells the pooled loans to a trust, which issues interest bearing securities that can achieve a credit rating separate from the financial institution that originates the loan. The typically higher credit rating is given because the securities that are used to fund the securitization rely solely on the cash flow created by the assets, not on the payment promise of the issuer.

The monthly payments from the underlying assets – loans or receivables – typically consist of principal and interest, with principal being scheduled or unscheduled. The cash flows produced by the underlying assets can be allocated to investors in different ways. Cash flows can be directly passed through to investors after administrative fees are subtracted, thus creating a “pass-through” security; alternatively, cash flows can be carved up according to specified rules and market demand, thus creating "structured" securities."&lt;ref name="Dwight"/&gt;

This is an organized way of functioning of the credit markets at least in the Developed Primary non-tradable in the open market, company to company, bank to bank dealings to keep the markets running, afloat as well as operational and provision of the liquidity by the liquidity providers in the market, which is very well scrutinized for any "aberration, excessive instrument based hedging and market manipulation" or "outlier, volumes" based trades or any such "anomalies, block trades 'company treasury' based decision without proper and posterior/prior intimation", by the respective regulators as directed by the law and as spotted in the regular hours of trading in the pre-market/after-hours trading or in the event based specific stocks and corrected and scrutinized for insider trading in the form of cancellation of the trades, re-issuance of the amount of the cancelled trades or freezing of the markets (specific securities being taken off the trading list for the duration of time) in event of a pre-set, defined by the maximum and minimum fluctuation in the trading in the secondary market that is the over the counter markets.

Generally the Primary markets are more scrutinized by the same commission but this market comes under the category of institutional and company related trades and underwritings, as well as guarantees and hence is governed by the broader set of rules as directed in the corporate and business law and reporting standards governing the business in the specific geography.

'''Avraham Yosef Shapira''' ({{lang-he|אברהם יוסף שפירא}}; born 2 March 1921, died 26 June 2000) was an [[Israel]]i politician and businessman.

==Biography==
Born in Romania in 1921, Shapira attended the Kokhav MeYa'akov [[yeshiva]] in [[Trzebinia]], and was later certified as a teacher. He made [[aliyah]] to Israel in 1949. He began working with his father, a furrier. In 1959 he bought a carpet factory, Carmel Carpets, in [[Or Akiva]]. At its peak the business employed 1,600 employees and had an annual turnover of $500 million.&lt;ref name=G&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/jul/04/guardianobituaries.israel Avraham Shapira: Religious powerbroker of Israel's turbulent politics] The Guardian, 4 July 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined [[Agudat Yisrael]], and became chairman of its [[Tel Aviv]] branch. He was elected to the Knesset on the party's list in [[Israeli legislative election, 1981|1981]] and became chairman of the governing coalition. He was re-elected in [[Israeli legislative election, 1984|1984]], after which he chaired the Finance Committee. He also served as chairman of the [[Bank of Israel]]'s steering committee,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mk_eng.asp?mk_individual_id_t=177 Avraham Yosef Schapira: Public Activities] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; wielding a strong influence on the country's financial state.

He lost his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1988|1988 elections]], but returned to the Knesset in [[Israeli legislative election, 1992|1992]] (by which time the party had formed the United Torah Judaism alliance with [[Degel HaTorah]]). He lost his seat again in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1996|1996 elections]].

He died in 2000 at the age of 79.

'''Border effects''' refer to asymmetries in trade patterns between cities and regions of different countries that share a national border and those that are located in the same country. Usually, trade volume is much lesser between the former cities and regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/iatl/reinvention/issues/volume6issue2/vanagas/ Border Effects Among EU Countries: Do National Identity and Cultural Differences Matter?]&lt;/ref&gt; Economic integration (as in the EU) may be a solution to overcome these effects.

'''Bravo''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] international company that produces machines for [[gelato]], [[pastry]], chocolate and savory food production.

Initially the production was focused on multi-machines, [[pasteurisation|pasteurizers]] and batch freezers, until 1974 when Genesio Bravo conceived and built the first multi-purpose machine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://italiacheinnova.nova100.ilsole24ore.com/2010/12/lhi-tech-per-palati-fini.html |title=L’hi-tech per palati fini - Viaggio nell'Italia che innova |publisher=Italiacheinnova.nova100.ilsole24ore.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-02 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the production of artisanal gelato, called "Trittico".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://italiacheinnova.nova100.ilsole24ore.com/2010/12/fai-il-bravo-e-ti-do-un-bel-gelato.html |title=Fai il Bravo e ti do un bel gelato - Viaggio nell'Italia che innova |publisher=Italiacheinnova.nova100.ilsole24ore.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-02 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years the company has grown in terms of [[Revenue|turnover]], repositioning itself in the market, increasing the production of machines and models, expanding the sales network and progressively inaugurating various [[branches]] in the world: in 1982 opens subsidiary in France, in 2010 the Asiatic one and in 2011 the North American one.

A '''business college''' is a school that provides education above the high school level but could not be compared to that of a traditional [[university]] or [[college]].  Unlike universities and even [[Junior college|junior]] and [[community college]]s, business colleges typically train the student for a specific [[vocational]] aspect, usually [[clerk|clerical]] tasks such as [[typing]], [[stenography]] or simple [[bookkeeping]].

The goal of a business college is not to provide a thorough education, as is the model of modern universities in the [[Liberal Arts|liberal arts]] fields, but rather to provide training for a very specific task.  Traditionally, credits earned at a business college do not transfer to other colleges or universities and students cannot earn a [[bachelor's degree]], though an [[associate degree]] may be offered.

In recent decades the number of these institutions has been declining as business colleges have been finding more competition coming from community colleges, which provide both vocational as well as liberal arts classes and are often able to offer the classes at a lower rate of tuition, as they are usually nonprofit and subsidized by one or more levels of government.  Business colleges should not be confused with [[business school]]s which typically offer a [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) program after a student has completed a bachelor's degree.

In the US, business colleges are sometimes also called [[proprietary colleges]], especially when they grant [[associate degree]]s or higher.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5616">'''Consumer-to-business''' ('''C2B''') is a [[business model]] in which [[Consumer|consumers]] (individuals) create value and businesses consume that value. For example, when a consumer writes reviews or when a consumer gives a useful idea for new product development then that consumer is creating value for the business if the business adopts the input. In the '''C2B model''', a reverse [[auction]] or demand collection model, enables buyers to name or demand their own price, which is often binding, for a specific good or service. Inside of a consumer to business market the roles involved in the transaction must be established and the consumer must offer something of value to the business.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5001-what-is-c2b.html|title=What is C2B?|work=Business News Daily|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another form of C2B is the [[electronic commerce]] business model in which consumers can offer products and services to companies, and the companies pay the consumers. This business model is a complete reversal of the traditional business model in which companies offer goods and services to consumers ([[business-to-consumer]] = B2C).  We can see the C2B model at work in [[blogs]] or [[internet forums]] in which the author offers a link back to an online business thereby facilitating the purchase of a product (like a book on [[Amazon.com]]), for which the author might receive affiliate revenues from a successful sale. [[Elance]] was the first C2B model e-commerce site.

C2B is a kind of economic relationship that is qualified as an inverted business type. The advent of the C2B scheme is due to:

* The internet connecting large groups of people to a bidirectional network; the large traditional media outlets are one-directional relationships whereas the internet is bidirectional.
* Decreasing costs of technology; individuals now have access to technologies that were once only available to large companies (digital printing and acquisition technology, high-performance computers, and powerful software).

== Positives and Negatives: ==
Nowadays people have smartphones or connect to the internet through personal tablets/computers daily allowing consumers to engage with brands online. According to Katherine Arline, in traditional consumer-to-business models companies would promote goods and services to consumers, but a shift has occurred to allow consumers to be the driving force behind a transaction.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; To the consumers benefit, reverse auctions occur in consumer to business markets allowing the consumer to name their price for a product or service. A consumer can also provide value to a business by offering to promote a business products on a consumers blog or social media platforms.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Businesses are provided value through their consumers and vice versa. Businesses gain in C2B from the consumers willingness to negotiate price, contribute data, or market to the company. Consumers profit from direct payment of the reduced-price goods and services and the flexibility of the transaction the C2B market created.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Consumer to business markets have their downfall as well. C2B is still a relatively new business practice and has not been fully studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Deng-Neng|date=October 11, 2006|title=An agent-based model for consumer-to-business electronic commerce|url=|journal=Expert Systems with Applications|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinguishing Between Traditional Business Models: ==
Consumer to business is an up and coming business market that can be utilized as a companies entire business model or added to an already existing model.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Consumer to business (C2B) is the opposite of business to consumer (B2C) practices and is facilitated by the internet or online forms of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of Marketing|last=Doyle|first=Charles|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780198736424|location=Online|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important distinction between the traditional business to consumer market is that the consumer chooses to be apart of the business relationship inside a consumer to business market. For a relationship to exist though both parties must acknowledge that it exists implying that the relationship is important to both participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raciti|first=Maria M.|last2=Ward|first2=Tony|last3=Dagger|first3=Tracey S.|date=2013-03-29|title=The effect of relationship desire on consumer‐to‐business relationships|url=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emeraldinsight.com%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1108%2F03090561311297490|journal=European Journal of Marketing|language=en|volume=47|issue=3/4|pages=615–634|doi=10.1108/03090561311297490|issn=0309-0566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data and analytics are going to drive the C2B world and enable companies to gain a better understanding of customers. Businesses need to go back to what drives the sales, people. Move away from innovation and the newest technology and go back to who, what, and why of the people interacting with businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dmnews.com/customer-experience/news/13056009/forget-b2b-or-b2cits-about-c2b|title=Forget B2B or B2C—It's About C2B|work=DMNews.com|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dick Spring''' (born 29 August 1950) is an Irish businessman and former politician. He was a [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] [[Teachta Dála]] (TD) for the [[Kerry North (Dáil constituency)|Kerry North]]  from 1981 to 2002. He became leader of the Labour Party in 1982, and held this position until 1997. He served as [[Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government|Minister for the Environment]] (1982–83), [[Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht|Minister for Energy]] (1983–87) and [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] (1993–Nov. 1994, Dec. 1994–97). 

He served as [[Tánaiste]] during those three governments.&lt;ref name=oireachtas_db&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;HouseNum=28&amp;MemberID=1048&amp;ConstID=111|title=Mr. Dick Spring|work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his political career Spring was a successful sportsman who played for the [[Ireland national rugby union team]].

==Early life==
Spring was born in [[Tralee]], [[County Kerry]] in 1950, the son of [[Dan Spring|Dan]] and Anna Spring (nee Laide). He was educated at [[Cistercian College, Roscrea|Cistercian College]] in [[Roscrea]], [[County Tipperary]], and at [[Trinity College Dublin]], and qualified as a barrister at [[King's Inns]]. He is a descendant of the [[Anglo-Irish]] [[Spring family]] that settled in County Kerry in the late 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. O'Laughlin, ''Families of Co. Kerry, Ireland'' (Irish Roots Cafe, 1994), 137–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sporting career==
Spring played [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]] for [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] in the seventies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2008/0227/1203619485880.html|title=How rugby put Spring in step|work=The Irish Times|date=27 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played his club football with the [[Kerins O'Rahilly's]] club in [[Tralee]] and hurling with [[Crotta O'Neill's]], he also played underage hurling with Austin Stacks and won a minor county championship in 1967. His father [[Dan Spring|Dan]] won two [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]]s in [[1939 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1939]] and [[1940 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1940]].

He then won [[rugby union]] caps for [[Munster Rugby|Munster]], and lined out for [[London Irish]] in the UK. He also was capped for [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] three times during the [[1979 Five Nations Championship]], debuting against {{nrut|France}} on 20 January 1979 at [[Lansdowne Road]], and receiving his last international cap on 17 February 1979 against {{nrut|England}} at [[Lansdowne Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/ireland/rugby/player/8212.html|title=Ireland/Players &amp; Officials/Dick Spring|work=ESPN Scrum dot Com|date=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
===Early career===
Spring's political life began in 1979, when he successfully contested the local elections in Tralee. He replaced his father Dan Spring TD on [[Kerry County Council]] that year. Spring senior had been a TD for [[Kerry North (Dáil constituency)|Kerry North]] since 1943, mostly representing Labour, but he was briefly a member of [[National Labour Party (Ireland)|National Labour]].

He was first elected to [[Dáil Éireann]] in the [[Irish general election, 1981|general election of 1981]] for the constituency of Kerry North, the seat previously held by his father Dan.&lt;ref name=elecs_irl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=3357|title=Dick Spring|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour Party formed a coalition Government with [[Fine Gael]] and Spring was appointed a [[Minister of State (Ireland)|junior minister]] on his first day as a Deputy. When [[Michael O'Leary (politician)|Michael O'Leary]] resigned as party leader after the [[Irish general election, February 1982|February 1982 general election]], Spring allowed his name to go forward in the leadership contest. He easily defeated [[Barry Desmond]] and [[Michael D. Higgins]], but inherited the leadership of a deeply divided party. Spring was a strong opponent of far left-wing anti-coalition politics and systematically removed [[Trotskyist]] activists from the party. Most notably he expelled the Militant Tendency (later [[Socialist Party (Ireland)|Socialist Party]]), including [[Joe Higgins]] and [[Clare Daly]].

===Ministerial appointment===
Following the [[Irish general election, November 1982|November 1982 general election]] Labour again formed a coalition government with Fine Gael. Spring was appointed [[Tánaiste]] and [[Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government|Minister for the Environment]]. He was closely involved in the negotiations which led to the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]] in 1985. In 1987, the Labour Party withdrew from the government on budgetary issues, and [[Fianna Fáil]] took power in the subsequent election. Spring himself narrowly escaped losing his seat when he was re-elected by just four votes.

===Opposition===
Under Spring, the Labour Party selected [[Mary Robinson]] as its candidate in the [[Irish presidential election, 1990|1990 presidential election]]. Robinson was elected, and this success enhanced the credibility of his leadership of the party. For Spring, his period in opposition coincided, with the exposure of a number of business scandals and gave him the opportunity to shine as a critic of the Fianna Fáil government, led by the controversial [[Charles Haughey]].

==="Spring Tide" and return to power===
As a result, in the [[Irish general election, 1992|1992 general election]] the party increased its number of Dáil seats from 15 to 33, at the time its largest-ever number, an event which is referred to as the "Spring Tide". After the election, no government could be appointed when the new Dáil met. After some weeks of stalemate, Spring decided to enter negotiations with [[Albert Reynolds]]—who had taken over as [[Taoiseach]] from Haughey at the beginning of the year—over the Christmas period on a new programme for government. The Labour Party then entered a coalition government with Fianna Fáil, and thus returned Reynolds to power. Spring was appointed Tánaiste for the second time, and also [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Minister for Foreign Affairs]]. This was approved by a special party conference of over 1,000 delegates at Dublin's [[National Concert Hall]] in January 1993, though there were some Labour Party TDs who dissented from the leadership position and wanted a coalition with Fine Gael.

Labour took six of the fifteen cabinet ministries and had much of its election manifesto accepted by Fianna Fáil. New Departments of Equality and Law Reform, and of Arts and Culture, were established. Ethics legislation was to outlaw conflicts of interest. Male homosexual acts were to be decrminalised. Purchase of condoms without medical prescription was to be allowed. An extensive programme of family law reform and provision for a divorce referendum was to be undertaken. Spring insisted on a formalised system of programme managers, and state-paid advisers to push the new Government's policy platform.

However support for the Labour Party declined, particularly as many voters felt betrayed at Labour for going into government with Fianna Fáil.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In 1994 the Labour Party performed disastrously in two by-elections, in [[Dublin South-Central (Dáil constituency)|Dublin South-Central]] and in [[Cork North-Central (Dáil constituency)|Cork North-Central]]. In both cases the seats were won by [[Democratic Left (Ireland)|Democratic Left]]. This had grave implications for the electoral health of the party and therefore for the policy of the Labour leadership. Clearly Labour was not doing well electorally, and needed to assess its role in the coalition.

In late 1994, Reynolds wished to appoint the [[Attorney General of Ireland|Attorney General]], [[Harry Whelehan]], as President of the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]], but delayed for over a month. Spring had reservations about Whelehan being suitable, owing to the alleged laxity of his handling of a particular child abuse criminal case, involving a disgraced Catholic priest. Reynolds for his part could not understand why Spring was against Whelehan being nominated to the High Court, and yet had no concerns with Whelehan serving as Attorney General. Reynolds became annoyed with Spring's stance, his failure to communicate his reservations, and decided to proceed anyway, whilst calling Spring's bluff. Spring withdrew with his ministers from the cabinet meeting which proceeded to recommend Mr Whelehan's appointment to the President. Immediately afterward, Reynolds implemented the decision.

There followed a rather heated discussion in the Dáil, concerning the appointment. Fine Gael started asking questions about Whelehan's suitability and objectivity. This was supportive of Spring's position. Democratic Left TD [[Pat Rabbitte]] then implied that the Catholic hierarchy were instructing Reynolds to appoint Whelehan. Reynolds became irate with this allegation, and responded angrily. Reynolds now realised that Spring was uncompromising about Whelehan. In an effort to remain in government, Reynolds removed Whelehan; however, Spring refused to go back into government with Reynolds. Whelehan served as President of the High Court for one day.

Spring proceeded to withdraw from government. The minority Reynolds government then lost a vote of confidence in the Dáil. Reynolds resigned as party leader, but continued as a caretaker Taoiseach. Spring entered into negotiations with Reynolds' new successor, [[Bertie Ahern]], the [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]]. They agreed to reform the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government in early December. On the eve of that government being formed, ''[[The Irish Times]]'' published a report that Ahern knew more about an aspect of the scandal that had brought down Reynolds than had previously been known. Spring broke off negotiations with Fianna Fáil, and instead pursued negotiations to form a coalition with Fine Gael and Democratic Left. In December of that year, Labour together with Fine Gael and Democratic Left formed a coalition government, referred to as the [[24th Government of Ireland|'Rainbow Coalition']], forestalling the possibility of an election. Spring returned to his positions as Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs. This was the first occasion on which a new Irish government was formed without a general election. The previous Fianna Fáil and Labour Programme for Government was substantially adopted by the new government and in return for making [[John Bruton]] the Taoiseach, [[Ruairi Quinn]] of Labour became the first-ever Labour Minister for Finance.

During his period as Foreign Minister, Spring along with Reynolds was involved in negotiations leading to the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] and [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] ceasefires of 1994 and the [[Good Friday Agreement]] of 1998. With Albert Reynolds, he received warm applause in the Dáil on the announcement of the [[Downing Street Declaration]] in December 1993. He also advanced Ireland's membership of the [[Partnership for Peace]], a sister organization of [[NATO]] a controversial issue due to Ireland's policy of [[Neutral country|neutrality]].

===Resignation as party leader and defeat as TD===
In the [[Irish general election, 1997|1997 general election]] the Labour Party returned to opposition, winning only 17 of its outgoing 33 seats. This was considered by some to be a punishment by the electorate for the 1993 decision to enter coalition with Fianna Fáil. By others, it was considered a punishment for changing horses at the end of 1994, in order to remain in power. A front-page article in the ''[[Irish Independent]]'' on the day prior to the election, entitled "Payback Time" and calling on support for Fianna Fáil, had a direct and severe impact on the Labour Party. The ''Independent'' newspaper group had revealed many scandals involving Labour ministers abusing the perks of office in the year leading up to the election. The article was controversial, because Spring had taken decisions in office which went against the broader business interests of the ''Independent'''s owner [[Anthony O'Reilly]], who was accused by Labour supporters of having attempted to use his paper's political influence to intimidate the Government into favouring companies linked to O'Reilly. The impact of the article is uncertain but the Labour Party suffered significant electoral losses and the outgoing coalition was defeated. In the [[Irish presidential election, 1997|presidential election of the same year]] the Labour Party candidate, [[Adi Roche]], came fourth out of five candidates. Following that defeat, Spring resigned as Labour Party leader, having served 15 years — one of the longest-serving party leaders of Ireland.

He remained a TD, being appointed a director in the formerly state owned recently privatized telecommunications company [[Eircom]] in 1999. Its initial flotation led to a stock market bubble which affected a large number of small shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2000/0913/eircom.html |title=Eircom Directors heavily criticised by shareholders|work=RTÉ |accessdate=24 April 2012|date=13 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed that he did not purchase shares in the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/spring-has-yet-to-invest-in-eircom-shares-516181.html | work=Irish Independent | title=Spring has yet to invest in Eircom shares | date=24 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spring lost his seat in a shock result at the [[Irish general election, 2002|2002 general election]]. He has not sought political office since.

==Political legacy==
In Irish political circles, the role of foreign minister was considered a poisoned chalice because of the challenge of resolving the delicate problem of how to de-escalate tensions in Northern Ireland, when both sides were wary of Irish governmental policy. Albert Reynolds, and Dick Spring, placed Northern Ireland at the top of the government agenda. Both were helped considerably by the initiative of John Hume, and the understanding built up between Reynolds, and British Prime Minister [[John Major]]. Spring devoted considerable energy and resources towards increasing Ireland's international influence and diplomatic ties in UN, in the post [[Cold War]] world.

As Foreign Minister, there was much critical comment in the media on Spring's extensive foreign travel. Spring got even harsher criticism, for using the Government Jet to reduce journey times between his home in Tralee and his office in Dublin. However, he did conduct, for the first time, a public consultative process that involved a wide range of citizenry and social groups as well as members of the diaspora, in the re-shaping of Irish foreign policy through the first ever White Paper on Foreign Policy in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Challenges and Opportunities Abroad - White Paper on Foreign Policy, Department of Foreign Affairs, Stationery Office, Dublin 1996 {{ISBN|0-7076-2385-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of Dick Spring have described him as a [[Champagne socialist]], owing to his choice of the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] when staying in New York as Foreign Minister, instead of staying in the then Irish-owned Fitzpatrick Hotel.&lt;ref name=lift&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/news-gossip/ogaras-lay-rift-rumours-to-rest-in-ny-1210902.html | title = O'Garas lay rift rumours to rest in NY | accessdate = 18 January 2009 | date = 4 November 2007 | work = Irish Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spring brought the Irish Labour Party unprecedented exposure and power in government, at a time when the two significantly larger right-of-centre political blocs had precedence in every election.

==Subsequent life==
Spring later became involved in the [[Cyprus dispute]] as a [[United Nations]] envoy.

Spring received a directorship appointment to the Irish state telecom enterprise, [[Eircom]], in advance of the scheduled privatisation. As leader of a left of centre party, this was to endorse the privatization, and gain consent from the labour unions to the privatisation plan. However the privatisation was a financial disaster for members of the public, who became ordinary shareholders in the privatisation process. Spring became the target for much of the discontent. Spring's low work involvement, and generous remuneration package, was openly described as 'scandalous', by shareholder advocate Senator [[Shane Ross]]. He continues to hold a directorship, with the Financial Services firm [[FEXCO]], based in [[Killorglin]], County Kerry.

Spring lives in Tralee with his wife Kristi (née Hutcheson), an American whom he met while working in New York as a bartender. They have three children. His nephew [[Arthur Spring]] was a Labour Party TD for [[Kerry North–West Limerick (Dáil constituency)|Kerry North–West Limerick]] until March 2016, having first been a councillor for the Tralee electoral area of [[Kerry County Council]]. Spring is a member of Ballybunion Golf Club, and has invited former [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]], amongst others, to visit there.

He is a director of [[Allied Irish Bank]] and receives annual pension payments of €121,108.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/thanks-big-fellas-ahern-and-cowen-get-massive-pensions-2931032.html|title=Thanks big fellas: Ahern and Cowen get massive pensions|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=10 November 2011|first=Fiach|last=Kelly|date=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Don Hamilton Barden''' (December 20, 1943 – May 19, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/20/business/20barden.html|title=Don Barden, a Leading Black Businessman, Dies at 67|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 19, 2011|author=[[Nick Bunkley]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an American casino executive.

Barden was the Manager, Chairman, President and [[Chief Executive Officer]] of [[The Majestic Star Casino, LLC]] from its formation, with responsibility for key policy making functions. Since their inception, Barden had also served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Majestic Investor Holdings, LLC and Manager of Barden Colorado [[Blackhawk, Colorado]], Barden Mississippi [[Tunica, Mississippi]], and Barden Nevada [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]; and Chairman and President of BDI. Barden also served as Chairman or Barden Gary Foundation, Inc. and Don H. Barden Foundation, Inc. since their formations.

Additionally, he was the President and Chief Executive Officer of Barden Companies, Inc. and a group of other companies he owned and/or operated. Over the past 30 years, Barden had successfully developed, owned and operated many business enterprises in various industries including real estate development, casino gaming, broadcasting, cable television and international trade. In 2003, ''[[Black Enterprise]]'' Magazine selected Barden as Company of the Year. In 2004, Barden received the Trumpet Award for Entrepreneur of the Year.

For years the Barden gambling facility in [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]] existed beside another gambling facility belonging to [[Donald Trump]]. Barden bought the second facility for a price reflecting historic revenue at a time when several other facilities were opening up in Illinois and Indiana.  Majestic Star and Fitzgerald casinos in Indiana, Mississippi and Colorado filed for [[bankruptcy]] in November 2009.  In December 2011, the facilities were turned over to creditors. The Nevada casino and Barden's ownership in the [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania casino were separately held and were not part of the bankruptcy.

When one of Barden's companies acquired the [[Fitzgeralds Las Vegas|Fitzgeralds Las Vegas Casino]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], Barden became the first African-American casino owner in Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwebportal.com/wire/DA.cfm?ArticleID=527 |title=Don Barden, The New Black Face Of Vegas |accessdate=2008-03-05 |format= |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210020045/http://www.blackwebportal.com/wire/DA.cfm?ArticleID=527 |archivedate=December 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Barden was awarded the rights to build a casino in the North Shore area of Pittsburgh, adjacent to [[Heinz Field]], home of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].  The selection was made over heavy objections of local taxpayers who preferred another competing offer from [[Isle of Capri Casinos]].  That offer would have built a new multi-purpose arena adjacent to a casino complex in the area now occupied by the Civic Arena.  Isle of Capri agreed to foot the entire cost of the new complex, valued at the time at 290 million dollars.  Barden's selection by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Gaming Commission forced the city of Pittsburgh and the buildings principal tenant, the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], to come up with an alternate plan, using taxpayer money to fund the facility.

In 2008, Barden was unable to secure permanent financing that would that would have permitted work to continue on the North Shore Casino project.   Work at the site was stopped for weeks, until another investor could be found.  Only after Chicago billionaire [[Neil Bluhm]] of [[JMB Realty]] bought controlling interest in the project, did work continue. Barden retained a minority interest in the project.

On May 19, 2011, Don Barden died of [[lung cancer]] at [[The Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. He was 67. Earlier that year, his wife Bella had filed for legal separation, saying in court documents that her husband was so sick with cancer that he could not make his own business and financial decisions.{{elucidate|date=March 2016}} He and his wife Bella are interred at [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Detroit, Michigan)]] near the [[Michael Jackson]] commemorative [[cenotaph]].

==Legacy==
* Barden is featured on the documentary series ''[[Profiles of African-American Success]]''.

The '''duty of honest contractual performance''' is a contractual [[duty]] and [[implied term]] of a [[contract]], introduced into [[Canadian law]] in 2014 as a result of the decision of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in the case of [[Bhasin v. Hrynew]].

As a sub-category of [[good faith]] and a duty arising at [[common law]], contracting parties have a duty to act [[Honesty|honestly]] in the performance of their contractual obligations. The Court recognised, in passing this judgement, that a new common law duty was being created:

:It is appropriate to recognize a new common law duty that applies to all contracts as a manifestation of the general organizing principle of good faith: a duty of honest performance, which requires the parties to be honest with each other in relation to the performance of their contractual obligations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/14438/index.do Supreme Court Judgment: Bhasin v. Hyrnew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court further stated:

:Recognizing a duty of honest performance flowing directly from the common law organizing principle of good faith is a modest, [[wikt:incremental|incremental]] step. This new duty of honest performance is a general doctrine of contract law that imposes as a contractual duty a minimum standard of honesty in contractual performance. It operates irrespective of the intentions of the parties, and is to this extent analogous to equitable doctrines which impose limits on the [[freedom of contract]], such as the doctrine of [[unconscionability]]. However, the precise content of honest performance will vary with context ... &lt;ref&gt;[http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/14438/index.do Supreme Court Judgment: Bhasin v. Hyrnew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Parties may not contract out of this duty.&lt;ref&gt;Bull and Housser, [http://www.bht.com/resources/supreme-court-canada-bhasin-v-hrynew-%E2%80%93-principle-good-faith-and-duty-honesty-established Supreme Court of Canada, Bhasin v. Hyrnew], accessed 29 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The rooftop photovoltaic installation supports the Department of Defense's goal of increasing renewable energy sources to 25 percent of all energy consumed by the year 2025.]]

The [[United States Department of Defense]] is one of the largest single consumers of energy in the world, responsible for 93% of all US government fuel consumption in 2007 (Air Force: 52%; Navy: 33%; Army: 7%. Other DoD: 1%).&lt;ref name="Colonel Gregory J 2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2007/8/defense%20lengyel/lengyel20070815.pdf |title=Department of Defense Energy Strategy: Teaching an Old Dog New Tricks |last=Lengyel, Colonel, USAF |first=Gregory J. |date=August 2007 |series=21st Century Defense Initiative Foreign Policy Studies |publisher=[[The Brookings Institution]] |location=Washington, D.C |accessdate=May 12, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529175335/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2007/8/defense%20lengyel/lengyel20070815.pdf |archivedate=May 29, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In FY 2006, the DoD used almost 30,000 gigawatt hours (GWH) of electricity, at a cost of almost $2.2 billion. The DoD's electricity use would supply enough electricity to power more than 2.6 million average American homes. In electricity consumption, if it were a country, the DoD would rank 58th in the world, using slightly less than [[Denmark]] and slightly more than [[Syria]] (CIA World Factbook, 2006).&lt;ref name="Colonel Gregory J 2007"/&gt; The Department of Defense uses {{convert|4600000000|USgal|L}} of fuel annually, an average of {{convert|12600000|USgal|L}} of fuel per day. A large Army division may use about {{convert|6000|USgal|L}} per day. According to the 2005 ''CIA World Factbook'', if it were a country, the DoD would rank 34th in the world in average daily oil use, coming in just behind Iraq and just ahead of Sweden.&lt;ref name="Colonel Gregory J 2007"/&gt;

{{See also|Climate change and national security}}
The military recognizes that renewable energy can provide improvements in force safety and budget stability as well as mitigate climate change so it has several programs working on deploying alternative energy at major facilities and in forward operating bases. Admiral [[Samuel J. Locklear]] has called [[global warming|climate change]] the biggest concern for the United States military.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2013/03/09/admiral-samuel-locklear-commander-pacific-forces-warns-that-climate-change-top-threat/BHdPVCLrWEMxRe9IXJZcHL/story.html ''Chief of US Pacific forces calls climate biggest worry''] March 9, 2013 [[Boston Globe]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323826704578356702694593938 ''Navy Admiral Samuel J.

==Air Force==
The [[Air Force]] is the largest user of fuel energy in the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. The Air Force uses 10% of the nation's aviation fuel. ([[JP-8]] accounts for nearly 90% of its fuels.) This fuel usage breaks down as such: 82% jet fuel, 16% facility management and 2% ground vehicle/equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cna.org/documents/PoweringAmericasDefense.pdf Powering America’s Defense: Energy and the Risks to National Security] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108021815/http://www.cna.org/documents/PoweringAmericasDefense.pdf |date=2010-01-08 }}, CNA Analysis &amp; Solutions, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; To meet renewable energy goals, the Air Force plans to certify its entire fleet on coal-to-liquid synthetic fuel blends by 2011. By 2016, it plans to fuel half of its domestic transportation by US-produced synthetic blends, including blends of [[biofuels]] and jetfuels, known as Hydrotreated Renewable Jet (HRJ).&lt;ref name="EESI"/&gt; The Air Force is currently the leading purchaser of renewable energy within the Federal government and has been a long time pioneer of renewable energy development and leadership.

==Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs==
In 2010, DoD established the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Operational Energy Plans and Programs to coordinate energy issues. In July 2010, DoD also signed a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] with the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]] to facilitate cooperation and accelerate research, development, and deployment of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies.&lt;ref name="EESI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eesi.org/dod_eere_factsheet_072711 |title=DoD's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Initiatives |author=[http://www.eesi.org/ Environmental and Energy Study Institute] |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; DoD's Energy Conservation Investment Program (ECIP) improves the energy and [[water efficiency]] of existing Military Services' facilities. The program's projects help the Military Services save on energy usage and cost.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/expectmore/summary/10000062.2003.html Whitehouse.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] provided $120 million for the ECIP. {{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] has also given money for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]], [[United States Navy Reserve|Navy Reserve]], [[Marine Corps Reserve]], [[Air Force Reserve]], [[Army National Guard]] and [[Air National Guard]] facilities to invest in [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]].

==Recent developments==
The US Army has recently prioritized [[renewable energy]] strategies in Iraq.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Vogel, Steve. Pentagon Prioritizes Pursuit Of Alternative Fuel Sources, [[The Washington Post]], 4/13/09&lt;/ref&gt; Strategies include the Tactical Garbage to Energy Refinery Program, which converts {{convert|1|ST|t|abbr=on}} of waste to {{convert|11|USgal|L|abbr=on}} of JP-8 fuel, a [[photovoltaic]] flexible, portable mat, insulating foam technology, hybrid-electric [[Future Combat Systems Manned Ground Vehicles|Manned Ground Vehicle]]s (MGV), and highly efficient portable cells.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] gave more than $150 million to develop these technologies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Stateside, the Army created the Net Zero program with a goal to have 30 installations achieve net-zero energy by 2030, including some that will also be net-zero in waste and water.&lt;ref name="EESI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="net zero"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asaie.army.mil/Public/IE/doc/Net%20Zero%20White%20Paper%2014%20Dec%202010%20with%20graphics%20test%20%28Revised%29%202.pdf |title=Army Vision for Net Zero |publisher=U.S. Army |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, they opened the Base Camp Systems Integration Laboratory, which compares an energy efficient base camp with a traditional one and trains soldiers to use energy efficient technologies.&lt;ref name="SIL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.army.mil/article/60473/Base_Camp_Integration_Lab_opens_at_Fort_Devens/ |title=Base Camp Integration Lab opens at Fort Devens |publisher=U.S. Army |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Army Energy Security Implementation Strategy,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asaie.army.mil/Public/Partnerships/doc/AESIS_13JAN09_Approved%204-03-09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2009, gives details about the Army’s energy goals.&lt;ref name="AESIS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asaie.army.mil/Public/Partnerships/doc/AESIS_13JAN09_Approved%204-03-09.pdf |title=Army Energy Security Implementation Strategy |publisher=U.S. Army |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] established Task Force Energy to focus on meeting energy goals, which include reducing non-tactical petroleum use in the commercial fleet by 50 percent by 2015, producing at least 50 percent of shore based energy from alternative sources by 2050, acquiring 50 percent of total energy from alternative sources by 2020, and having 50 percent of Navy and Marine Corps installations be net-zero by 2020.&lt;ref name="EESI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Navy Energy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greenfleet.dodlive.mil/energy/ |title=U.S. Navy Energy, Environment, and Climate Change |publisher=U.S. Navy |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy hopes to demonstrate a Green [[Expeditionary Strike Group|Strike Group]] (fueled by biofuels and nuclear power) by 2012 and sail the Great Green Fleet by 2016.&lt;ref name="EESI"/&gt; The [[Office of Naval Research]] developed and deployed the Experimental Forward Operating Base (ExFOB), including photovoltaic energy, shelter insulation, small unit water purification, and energy efficient heating, lighting, and cooling.&lt;ref name="ExFOB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onr.navy.mil/~/media/Files/Fact%20Sheets/Experimental-Forward-Operating-Base.ashx |title=ONR Experimental Forward Operating Base |publisher=Office of Naval Research |accessdate=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Marine Corps|The Marine Corps]] established the Expeditionary Energy Office to increase combat effectiveness by reducing the need for liquid [[fossil fuel]] by 50 percent by 2025, using liquid fuel for mobility only.&lt;ref name="E2O"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marines.mil/community/Documents/E2O%20Office%20Overview%20PDF.pdf |title=USMC Expeditionary Energy Office |publisher=U.S. Marine Corps}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Defense Department plans to invest $9 billion to improve energy use in military operations through 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2012/08/mil-120815-dod01.htm "Department of Defense Certifies Key Energy Investments Support Increased Combat Capability."] ''DoD'', 15 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the [[SolarStrong]] program, a total of 300MW of PV installations were done on 120,000 roofs of base housing throughout the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleanenergyauthority.com/solar-energy-news/solarcity-announces-major-military-housing-contract-072513 SolarCity announces another major military housing contract], DigitalGreenMedia, Amanda H.

As a regular source of news and information HVG has a significant influence on business decision makers and other stakeholder groups. With its editorial office in [[Budapest]], HVG provides objective information about domestic and international politics, economy and society. Capitalizing on its all-round column structure HVG puts great emphasis on the presentation of public issues and their context, besides reporting of recent events in cultural life and news from science and technology.

HVG's online news portal '''[http://hvg.hu/ hvg.hu]''' which is available on all platforms: mobile, tablet, android and iOS applications. With its news and analyzes HVG reaches more than 1.5 million people every week on its various print and digital platforms.
[[File:HVG 2018 24.png|thumb|HVG weekly cover page 2018/33]]
Ever since its foundation HVG stands for independent journalism and free expression. In April 2018, HVG launched a supportive [https://tagsag.hvg.hu/ membership program] in which readers who join the HVG community can, in return for their financial support, enjoy many benefits in addition to diverse, independent and factual information.

==History and profile==
The magazine was very important in the years spanning the [[Revolutions of 1989|transition from communism]] in airing new ideas and challenging boundaries.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|title=The press in Hungary|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3616011.stm|date=29 April 2004|accessdate=10 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period it was also a leading [[Investigative journalism|investigative]] publication.&lt;ref name=sip&gt;{{cite journal|author=Balazs Sipos|title=Bias, partisanship, journalistic norms and ethical problems in the contemporary Hungarian political media|journal=Central European Journal of Communication|date=2013|volume=7|issue=1|url=http://ptks.pl/cejc/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CEJC_Vol7_No1_Sipos.pdf|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; HVG Publishing Co. was founded in 1989. In 2003 Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung ([[Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung|WAZ]]) acquired 75% of the magazine.&lt;ref name=sip/&gt; In 2014 WAZ (Funke) redeemed its majority stake, which was bought back by former HVG shareholder, management and editorial staff, and HVG was again in Hungarian hands. In response to changes in the market, digital content gained more and more importance within HVG Publishing's activities, and the product portfolio continued to expand. Apart from the weekly magazine and its specials, annexes and numerous professional or entertaining periodicals, HVG Publishing Co. has become one of the largest book publishers in Hungary, while conferences, seminars or even the largest Hungarian Job Fair continue to color the Publisher's product range.

Political and power measures in the second half of the 2010s are increasingly breathing air from market-based media companies and increasingly discouraging the survival of independent journalism. In this hostile market environment HVG's goal and mission remains to provide independent and factual information to readers. The slogan of HVG also expresses this mission while reflecting on the current situation. '''''’[https://tagsag.hvg.hu/ Darkness does not last forever]’''''', along with the statement '''''’Let there be light’''''', with which HVG encourages and sympathizes with its readers, reminiscing of the first years spent in an almost ’half-illegitimacy’ under the socialist regime.

The politics that undermine independent press and the expansion of international social media and search giants ''(Facebook, Google)'' in the advertising market puts under unprecedented pressure HVG’s business model built on copy sales and advertisements. HVG has launched a [https://tagsag.hvg.hu/ Membership Program] in April 2018, whereby readers who join the HVG community can enjoy many benefits in return for their financial support in addition to diverse, independent and factual information.

Some articles are also available online and in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European media sources |work=Central European University Business School'' |url=http://www.ceubusiness.org/index.php?page=714&amp;l=1 |accessdate=10 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502215814/http://www.ceubusiness.org/index.php?page=714&amp;l=1 |archivedate=2 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HVG cover pages==
HVG's iconic cover pages always work on one of the main themes of the week, mostly depicting ironic humor. In the 80's, headlines were mostly not photos, but graphics featuring suggestive hints. These covers intended to affect the sense of humor of readers sensitive to the criticism of the ruling political system. After the change of regime, cover pages became partly more concrete, and partly continued the earlier tradition.

'''Irman Gusman''' (born 11 February 1962) is an Indonesian politician and businessman. He is a former &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/news/irman-gusman-lashes-dpd-dumped-speaker-role/|title=Irman Gusman Lashes Out at DPD After Being Dumped From Speaker Role|last=|first=|date=6 October 2016|work=|newspaper=The Jakarta Globe|access-date=|via=|place=Jakarta}}&lt;/ref&gt; speaker of the [[Regional Representative Council]] (''DPD'') of Indonesia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/news/dpd-speaker-irman-gusman-attends-mikta-meeting-s-korea/ "DPD Speaker Irman Gusman Attends Mikta Meeting in S. Korea" in Jakarta Globe]&lt;/ref&gt; who became the first Indonesian parliamentary leader to be elected for two consecutive terms. This earned him the nickname ''Pejuang daerah'' (lit. "Regional warrior", with "regional" as in the Regional Representative Council).

==Early life==
Irman Gusman was born in [[Padang Panjang]], [[West Sumatra]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/03/22/irman-gusman-change-now-or-never.html |title=Irman Gusman: CHANGE Now or Never |author=Ridwan Max Sijabat |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |place=Jakarta |date=22 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; on 11 February 1962 to Gusman Gaus and Janimar Kamili. His father was rector of the Muhammadiyah University of West Sumatra, while his mother was the daughter of gold traders.

Gusman completed his undergraduate education at the Faculty of Economics of the [[Universitas Kristen Indonesia|Christian University of Indonesia]] (''UKI''), where he was chairman of the Student Senate. He subsequently obtained a [[Master of Business Administration]] at the Graduate School of Business of the [[University of Bridgeport]]. Upon his return from the United States, Irman Gusman became more active in economic and social fields.

==Political career==
Irman Gusman is one of the leading figures of the [[post-Suharto era]]. He fought for the need of recognition and accommodation of regional interests at the various state institutions. His policy is based on Indonesia being a multicultural nation. For Irman Gusman, the political system and government should reflect this.

Together with [[Ginandjar Kartasasmita]] and associates, Irman Gusman made an important contribution to the establishment of the [[Regional Representative Council]] or Senate, a new checks and balances system within the national government system.

Irman Gusman began his political career in 1999 as member of the [[People's Consultative Assembly]] (''MPR''), representing West Sumatra. In 2004, he was elected member of the newly formed ''DPD'', representing West Sumatra and became vice-chairman of the ''DPD'' under chairman Ginandjar Kartasasmita.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tokohindonesia.com/en/biografi/article/285-ensiklopedi/1398-pengusaha-pejuang-daerah Irman Gusman Biography at Ensiklopedi Tokoh Indonesia]&lt;/ref&gt; Gusman was elected chairman of the ''DPD'' on 2 October 2009, having received 81 votes over his opponent Laode Ida's 46 votes. He began his second term on 2 October 2014, after winning from Farouk Muhammad with 66 against 53 votes.

Because he is not a member of a political party and due to his determination to embrace all social classes for the advancement of Indonesia, Irman Gusman was regarded more as a national leader or a statesman, rather than a politician. This distinguished him from many other politicians in the post-Suharto era.

On 5 October 2016 Gusman was officially discharged from his role as speaker following his earlier arrest for corruption&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/news/dpd-officially-discharges-speaker-irman-gusman/|title=DPD Officially Discharges Speaker Irman Gusman {{!}} Jakarta Globe|newspaper=Jakarta Globe|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joshua Kwabena Siaw''', popularly known as '''J. K. Siaw''' (January 1923 – October 1986), was a [[Ghana]]ian [[industrialist]] and philanthropist, who in 1969 established Tata Brewery Ltd. – now known as [[Guinness Ghana Breweries]], also as Achimota Brewery Company (ABC). He is notable for opening the largest wholly African-owned brewery company in [[West Africa]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201504241848.html "Ghana: What Did Rawlings Know About Konadu's Acquisition Of National Assets?"] AllAfrica.com, 24 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 all his assets were confiscated by the [[Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, Ghana|AFRC]] regime of Ghana under false allegations of tax evasion. He died in [[London]], in exile, in October 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.ancestry.co.uk/cgi-bin/sse.dll?gl=allgs&amp;gss=sfs28_ms_f-2_s&amp;new=1&amp;rank=1&amp;msT=1&amp;gsfn=Joshua%20Kwabena&amp;gsln=Siaw&amp;MSAV=0&amp;msbdy=1923&amp;cpxt=1&amp;cp=11&amp;catbucket=rstp&amp;uidh=000 Ancestry UK, "Joshua Kwabena Siaw - Ancestry UK".] Ancestry UK, accessed 27 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Joshua Kwabena Siaw was born in [[Obomeng]], a small town in the [[Eastern Region (Ghana)|Eastern Region]] of Ghana, in January 1923. His father came from Akwaseho and his mother from [[Juaben]] in the [[Ashanti Region]]. J. K. Siaw worked with his father on a cocoa farm before attending school, aged 12, in 1935, and he took to basket-making as a way to make more money to further his own education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Story_of_Tata.html?id=uzPUAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''The Story of Tata''], "a very comprehensive account of the life of Mr. Joshua Kwabena Siaw ... one of Ghana's most prominent business men".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Teacher ===
In 1942, aged 19, Siaw became a teacher of Standard One class in [[Akwaseho]]. After a couple of months he went to work at the Orthodox Mission School and then to the Bremang Gold Dredging Company near Bogoso, in [[Ghana]]'s Western Region. After just one month, he went to Effiduase Banko to work again as a teacher from June 1943 to March 1945.
Siaw then went to work at the New Juaben Grammar School but left after a year because the headmaster, Mr. Sarkodea, was mismanaging the school. Siaw established Christ College in 1946 with his father, before apprenticing with a pharmacist for a year. Christ College evolved into Ghana Secondary School in Effiduase by 1976.&lt;!--- Therefore J. K. Siaw was contributing to Ghana’s education for decades before he became a well-known industrialist. (unnnecessary comment?)---&gt;

=== Cocoa broker ===
Siaw then decided to go into business and borrowed £50 (£1500.00 in 2013 relative value) to start up as a cocoa broker. In four months he had made £600 (£18,000.00 in 2013 relative value) profit. In April 1950 he became a siding clerk at Kwahu Praso, transporting cocoa to [[Accra]], Ghana's capital. He repaid the £200 security charge for the clerking employment with interest in six months and was bound for a further six months, by contract, but he decided to stay for only four.
In 1953 he worked as a siding clerk, this time for the Cocoa Purchasing Company, which paid £6 a month. He became a cocoa and timber transporter in 1954.

=== Entrepreneur ===
In 1957, he began selling enamelware until the [[Government of Ghana]] under [[Kwame Nkrumah]] banned the importation of those goods.

In 1964, Siaw's first request to the government to be granted permission to set up a brewery was rejected. He applied again in 1967 and that application too was rejected on the grounds that licences had been given to Ashanti and [[Takoradi]] breweries. Despite being offered an investment of 400,000 cedis from Siaw, Takoradi brewery could not happen.

== Tata Brewery ==
A third application to the government to set up a brewery was successful and approved 26 July 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.annualreportsghana.com/Home/Documents/Circulars/Companies/Ghana-Breweries-(Prospectus,-Listing-by-Introducti.aspx "Ghana Breweries Propectus"], 2 July 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The approval was given to "Tata Trading Company" to establish a brewery in [[Cape Coast]] in the [[Central Region, Ghana]], "a place of fashion, scholarship, and beauty". A suitable site could not be found in Cape Coast and the project was relocated to Achimota, a town on the Accra-Nsawam Road.&lt;br /&gt;

The new National Redemption Council (NRC) government attempted to renegotiate the competing interests of the state, local businessmen, workers, and foreign capital. Loans and tax incentives were promised to Ghanaian businessmen who went into manufacturing.&lt;ref name=Akyeampong /&gt; 
 
Tata Brewery Ltd was commissioned on 30 January 1973, Siaw's 50th birthday. It was officially opened by the then Head of State Colonel [[Ignatius Kutu Acheampong]], who said of the event: "It is the single-minded and single-handed effort of Mr. J. K. Siaw... which has been responsible for what we see around us today. Mr. Siaw is an excellent example of the innate ability of the Ghanaian to rise to the needs of the occasion". Siaw had wanted "his Brewery to stand for centuries to come", "even longer than the famous [[Osu Castle|Christiansborg Castle]]". J. K. Siaw, established Tata Brewery Limited, the first fully Ghanaian-owned brewery in the country.

Tata Company secured exclusive export rights for the "Maltex" drink to neighbouring [[Togo]], Dahomey ([[Benin]]), Upper Volta ([[Burkina Faso]]), [[Ivory Coast]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Senegal]], and [[The Gambia]] from [[Albani Brewery|Albani Breweries Limited]], a Danish firm operating in Ghana. The company was the first brewery to introduce draught beer into the country.

The [[Ghana Commercial Bank]] provided a loan of 950,000 cedis for the project to begin, with a pre-requisite that Siaw deposited 200,000 cedis. By 1976, the brewery employed 750 Ghanaians and only four expatriates. Siaw produced his own brand of beer - Tata Pilsner Beer.

"In the country's bid to industrialize, the alcohol industry has played a pioneering role."&lt;ref name=Akyeampong&gt;Emmanuel Akyeampong, "The State and Alcohol Revenues: Promoting 'Economic Development' in Gold Coast/Ghana, 1919 to the Present", ''Social History'', 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern Continental Bank ===

August 25th 1977 J.K Siaw formed The Modern Continental Bank together with Mr Kwadwo Ohene-Ampofo a legal practitioner.

=== Philanthropy ===
For the workers and their families there was a clinic, a subsidised canteen and free transport to work. Siaw sought to build housing for the workers not too far from the site. Vaccinations were provided free of charge to the workers and their families.&lt;br /&gt;
 
Siaw presented to the [[Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital]] an electro-cardiograph, a piece of equipment the hospital was deficient of.&lt;br /&gt;
 
Siaw also donated towards the construction of a hospital in Akwaseho in 1975 and begun the building of a road from Akwaseho to Obomeng,&lt;ref&gt;George Antwi, [http://allafrica.com/stories/200304290290.html "Ghana: J. K.

Siaw was the subject of a book by [[J. Benibengor Blay]] entitled ''The Story of Tata'' (c.1976).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Story_of_Tata.html?id=uzPUAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''The Story of Tata''], "a very comprehensive account of the life of Mr. Joshua Kwabena Siaw ... one of Ghana's most prominent business men".&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1979: AFRC regime ==
See [[Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, Ghana]]

Siaw was among the businessmen targeted by the AFRC&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=48730 "Siaw's Seized Assets"], Ghana Web, 22 December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; under the "house cleaning" exercise against corruption.&lt;ref name=Akyeampong /&gt; The AFRC were under the impression that Ghana's wealthiest businessmen, of whom J. K. Siaw was the most prominent, must have acquired their wealth through corruption facilitated by the country's former leaders, including Lt. Gen. [[Akwasi Afrifa]], Gen. Acheampong and Lt. Gen. [[Fred Akuffo]], who were all executed. During the short time that the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council was the government of Ghana (4 June 1979 until 24 September 1979), Siaw was arrested on numerous occasions, and his house looted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=24540 "'We want our brewery back' - Tata Brewery owner’s son"], GhanaWeb, 3 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Junior soldiers raided his properties for a catalogue of items, including a £3000.00 gold watch (£33000.00 in 2013 relative value),&lt;ref name=ModernGhana&gt;[http://www.modernghana.com/news/28865/1/how-soldiers-looted-jk-siaw.html "How soldiers looted J.K. Siaw"], ModernGhana.com, 11 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; until he was released secretly by a junior soldier and left for [[Liberia]].

The tax-evasion charges totalled ¢10 million (as of 1979) however, they were false allegations.&lt;ref name=ModernGhana /&gt;

== Life in exile ==

=== Liberia Brewery ===
Following from the upheaval in Ghana in 1979, Siaw started again in Liberia, which by comparison to Ghana was a very safe and peaceful country in West Africa at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghanareview.com/NEW/shownews1.php?class=all&amp;date=2011-02-09&amp;id=46330 "GRi Database view".]&lt;/ref&gt;

===PNDC petitions===
Siaw petitioned the [[PNDC]] government, which came into power with the overthrow of the government of [[Hilla Limann]], who had been supported by the AFRC in the 1979 elections. The PNDC government systematically targeted businesses of other businessmen as well as Siaw.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyguideghana.com/?p=83475 "B. A. Mensah—-A Man Of Strength"], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616020123/http://www.dailyguideghana.com/?p=83475 |date=16 June 2013 }} ''Daily Guide'', 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Investigation Committee, created in 1982, was created to investigate corruption in public office. It reviewed cases of persons whose assets were confiscated by the state during the three-month rule of the AFRC. The NIC "found that the confiscation of all the assets of J. K. Siaw, owner of the former Tata Brewery, on the grounds that he engaged in over-invoicing and under-invoicing during the Acheampong period was a travesty of justice".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CgFaCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PA188&amp;dq=J+K+Siaw&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gozzpUginD&amp;sig=yvuseUENgeCKLj0AztSNkgWYm2Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcl4GN4dfNAhUrAcAKHUxrC_s4ChDoAQghMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=J%20K%20Siaw&amp;f=false "Corruption and Development in Africa: Lessons from Country Case Studies"], K. Hope, B. Chikulo.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Siaw left Liberia to live in [[South London]], until he died in October 1986. He had sent numerous petitions to the military government [[PNDC]] and had applied for safe entry to be allowed back into Ghana without risk of arrest. His body was flown back to Ghana in December of that year. He did not receive his assets back and was considered a criminal by the state, despite the allegations being baseless.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ghanaweb.com/mobile/wap.small/news.article.php?ID=29964 "Siaw paid all taxes after all"], from ''The Ghanaian Chronicle'', 27 November 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return of property and compensation issue==
In the 1990s under the NDC government, successor to the PNDC government and AFRC, Tata Brewery (by then Achimota Brewery Company) was privatised. The [[International Finance Corporation]] provided a US$3.5 million loan and a US$1 million equity investment to help finance the US$24.5 million privatization, rehabilitation, and expansion of Achimota Brewery Company (ABC) in Accra, Ghana. The sale of the brewery by the Government of Ghana represented the largest non-mining privatization in Ghana by that time.&lt;ref&gt;Asimina Caminis,

J. K.

Accra Metropolitan Assembly website.&lt;/ref&gt; on a "where is, as is basis", meaning they were made to accept the properties in the condition the government was prepared to return them. It was hinted that compensation would be paid to those whose properties were sold,&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.myjoyonline.com/pages/news/200810/21696.php "Confiscated properties to be returned"], Joy Online, 16 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; yet despite Tata Brewery being sold twice since confiscation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/election2008/artikel.php?ID=243947 "Governments use de-confiscation for political expedience - Siaw"], GhanaWeb, 5 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; the family received no compensation on that single property, nor on the list of items looted from Siaw's numerous properties.

'''Louis Jacques Balsan''' (September 16, 1868 &amp;ndash; November 4, 1956) was a French aviator and industrialist, born at [[Châteauroux]] (Indre) in 1868, who was the second husband of society beauty [[Consuelo Vanderbilt]], Duchess of Marlborough. He married her immediately after her divorce from the [[9th Duke of Marlborough]] in 1921.&lt;ref name="JBObit1956"/&gt; 

==Early life==
Balsan was born on September 16, 1868 in [[Châteauroux]], [[France]].  He was the son of [[Auguste Balsan]] and Marie ([[née]] Dupuytren).  Among his siblings was brother was [[Étienne Balsan]], the first patron of [[Coco Chanel]],&lt;ref name="D'Hauterive"&gt;{{cite book |last1=D'Hauterive |first1=M. Borel |title=Annuaire De La Noblesse De France et Des Maisons Souveraines De L'Europe, Volume 44 |date=1888 |publisher=Typographie De E. Plon, Nourrit |location=[[Paris]] |page=245 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=blwoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA245&amp;lpg=PA245 |accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sister, Viscountess Villeneuve de Bargemont of [[Davenescourt]], France.&lt;ref name="JBObit1956"/&gt;

Through his mother, he was descended from [[Guillaume Dupuytren]], the [[anatomist]] and [[surgery|surgeon]] who treated [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] and, today, is best known today for his description of [[Dupuytren's contracture]], which is named after him and which he first operated on in 1831 and published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dupuytren|first=Guillaume|date=May 10, 1834|journal=The Lancet|title=Clinical Lectures on Surgery|volume=22|issue=558|pages=222–5|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)77708-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacques Balsan came from a manufacturing family who created and run [[Balsan (Company)]] which supplied the French Army with uniforms from the time of [[Napoleon]] onwards which were the origin of the famous cloth "the blue horizon". The family's textile factories were situated at [[Châteauroux]].&lt;ref name="1921Engagement"/&gt; 
 
==Career==
At the age of 24, Jacques Balsan entered the family business and traveled the world, buying wool. 

Passionate about ballooning, in September 1900, while in the balloon ''St. Louis'' that was inflated with [[illuminating gas]], he remained aloft for 39 hours and nine minutes.&lt;ref name="JBObit1956"/&gt;  Later that same month, he earned the record for the highest altitude flight at the "[[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]]", by rising to a height of 8,558 meters;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation.maisons-champagne.com/dir.php?centre=04-bio-balsan&amp;menu=11 Champagne|Berceau De L'Aviation Du Monde, Jacques Balsan]&lt;/ref&gt; the following month traveling over 1,345 kilometers (roughly 850 miles) from [[Vincennes]] to [[Opoczno|Opoezno]], [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="JBObit1956"/&gt;

A pioneer of flying, he bought his first aircraft in 1905, a [[Octave_Chanute|Chanute]]-type glider, and an airplane in 1909 and obtained a Number 22 licence to pilot aircraft.  He also took part in aviation experiments with the [[Wright brothers]] in [[Biarritz]] and in 1910, constructed his own small plane.&lt;ref name="JBObit1956"/&gt;  In February 1910, in his [[Blériot Aéronautique|Blériot]] [[monoplane]], he won the "[[The meeting of Heliopolis|Le Prix d'Héliopolis]]" (in [[Egypt]]).

===Military service===
During [[World War I]], he helped organize the [[Lafayette Escadrille]] along with [[William K. Vanderbilt]] and Dr. Edmund Gros, also a founder of the [[American Hospital of Paris]] and organizer of the [[AFS Intercultural Programs#WWI|American Ambulance Field Service]].&lt;ref name="JBObit1956"/&gt;  Later, [[Michel-Joseph Maunoury|General Maunoury]] gave him charge of the aerial [[reconnaissance]] of the site of the [[First Battle of the Marne]]. In 1918, he went to London as chief of the [[French Air Force]] mission.  By the end of the War, he was promoted to the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel]].&lt;ref name="1921Engagement"/&gt; 

During [[World War II]], he joined the [[Free French]] forces in London, taking part in the operations that liberated southern France.&lt;ref name="JBObit1956"/&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:JB-125-1930-Jacques &amp; Consuelo-St Georges Motel.jpg|thumb|right|Jacques and Consuelo at [[Saint-Georges-Motel|St-Georges-Motel]], between 1930 and 1935.]]
Balsan first saw and immediately fell in love with wealthy American, [[Consuelo Vanderbilt]], when she was 17, before her marriage to the 9th [[Duke of Marlborough (title)|Duke of Marlborough]].&lt;ref name="1921Engagement"&gt;{{cite news |title=VANDERBILT TROTH REPORT IS REVIVED Marlborough Duchess's Rumored Engagement to Jacques Balsan No Surprise.HE IS FRENCH SPORTSMAN Duchess Recently Bought an Estate Near Monte Carlo—Both Are Now Among Colonists on Riviera. |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/02/13/112670889.pdf |accessdate=17 September 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 13, 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was considered the most eligible woman of the late [[Victorian Age]].  A memorable portrait of her by [[Carolus Duran]] hangs at [[Blenheim Palace]].  Balsan married her on 4 July 1921 (when he was 52 and she was 44), after which she was styled 'Mme Jacques Balsan',&lt;ref name="1921OffEngage"&gt;{{cite news |title=Give Notice of Coming Marriage of Col.

Known for his attentions to her, it was a very happy marriage.  Consuelo wrote to her close friend [[Winston Churchill]], during [[World War II]], while Jacques worked with the [[Free French]] in [[London]], to request his special protection and safe return. Winston obligingly facilitated his safe return to America.

The Balsans were hosting Winston and Clementine Churchill in September 1939, just before the outbreak of war at their chateau [[Saint-Georges-Motel]], near [[Dreux]] north of [[Paris]]. They also owned a property in [[Èze]] (Alpes-Maritimes) where they received a number of celebrities such as the [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught|Duke of Connaught]], son of Queen Victoria, The Maharajah de Kapurthala and [[Charlie Chaplin]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balsan|first1=Consuelo Vanderbilt|title=The glitter and the gold|date=2011|publisher=Hodder|location=London|isbn=1444730983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balsan supported his wife's work with French children. They lived in their ''[[hotel particulier]]'' in Paris, 9 avenue [[Avenue_Charles-Floquet|Charles-Floquet]].

[[Consuelo Vanderbilt]]'s ghosted autobiography ''The Glitter and The Gold'' refers to her time with Balsan as "gold", as opposed to the "glitter" of her earlier, aristocratic marriage.  In it, she tells the story of the Balsans' daring escape from the Nazis through Spain to Portugal and eventually to America, where they lived for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, Amanda Mackenzie. ''Consuelo and Alva Vanderbilt: The Story of a Daughter and Mother in the Gilded Age''. Harper Perennial, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James (Jim) Champy''' (born 1942) is an American business consultant, and organizational theorist, known for his work in the field of [[business process reengineering]], business process improvement and organizational change.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Life and work ==
Champy earned his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in 1963 and his [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in civil engineering in 1965 from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from [[Boston College Law School]] in 1968.

Champy was chairman and chief executive officer of CSC Index, the management consulting arm of [[Computer Sciences Corporation]]. He had been one of the original founders of Index, a $200 million consulting practice that was acquired by CSC in 1988. Subsequently he was chairman of Dell Perot Systems’ (now Dell Services) consulting practice, where he was responsible for providing direction and guidance to the company’s team of business and management consultants.

His approach centers on helping leaders achieve business results through four distinct, yet overlapping areas: business strategy, management and operations, organizational development and change, and information technology.

He is currently a senior research fellow at [[Harvard University Advanced Leadership Initiative|Harvard's Advanced Leadership Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=James|first=Champy|title=List of Fellows|url=http://advancedleadership.harvard.edu/2013-fellows/|publisher=Harvard University - Advanced Leadership Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a life member of the [[MIT]] Corporation, Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Board of Trustees, and serves on the Board of Overseers of the [[Boston College Law School]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1720">A '''loan note''' is a type of [[financial instrument]]; it is a [[contract]] for a [[loan]] that specifies when the loan must be repaid and usually also the interest payable. It is similar to a [[promissory note]] but the differences can be significant in terms of consequences, especially tax consequences. Chief of these is that by specifying the interest payable, the lender may obtain a tax shield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.practicallaw.com/4-107-6780 |title=Practical Law |publisher=Uk.practicallaw.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loan notes are simple but important instruments in business and finance. A loan note can also be conceived of as a form of deferred payment, and in the UK the tax treatment of loan notes is as either ‘qualifying corporate bonds’ (QCBs), which provide a tax shield, or as ‘non-qualifying corporate bonds’ (non-QCBs) Loan notes may contain other provisions such as convertibility into equity or other kinds of debt, in which case they are called "convertible loan notes". The loan note is one of the most widely used instruments in financing the entrepreneurial venture and in [[Startup company|start-ups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlapiper.com/~/media/Files/Insights/Publications/2014/06/Technology%20Start%20ups.pdf |format=PDF |title=Start-Up Pack : DLA Piper |publisher=Dlapiper.com |accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The General Survey of Madrid between 1749 and 1774 was one of the most important cadastral surveys of the Old Spanish regime.  The Planimetría General de Madrid resulted in the production 557 plans of blocks throughout Madrid.&lt;ref name=" Perellón"/&gt;

In the cadastre documentary data were collected on the ownership of Madrid properties and other features such as previous owners, map showing the plots into which each [[City block|manzana]] or block was divided, description of the configuration and structure of each building, size and quality of the building, indication of the name and number of tenants housed per room, the tax status according to the [[regalía de aposento|aposento]] charged, among other indicators. Each block was then numbered and identified with the objective of levying taxes. This identification done by the general visit resulted in a white tile being laid on every house with writing in blue letters indicating the number assigned: "Visita G. Casa nº123" (General Visit House # 123).&lt;ref name=" Perellón"/&gt;

The initial intentions of the [[Zenón de Somodevilla, 1st Marqués de la Ensenada|Marqués de la Ensenada]] was to renew the tax system in [[Crown of Castile|Castile]]. Among the constraints imposed on the inhabitants of Madrid was the [[regalía de aposento]]. The method by which taxes were imposed was based on the "Visita General" which identified the nature of property ownership and assessed the taxes on inhabitants accordingly.&lt;ref name="Camarero"/&gt;

The imprecision of the method resulted in it being eventually abandoned. It was repealed by [[Joaquín Vizcaíno|Marqués Viudo de Pontejos]] who replaced it with a more logical which consisted of identifying streets with names of famous persons and historical events. The white numbered tiles that were laid by officials during the survey are still evidenced on the façade of Madridean houses especially in the historic center of Madrid.&lt;ref name="Camarero"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19344">'''Policy entrepreneur''' refers to an individual who takes advantage of opportunities to influence policy outcomes to increase their self-interests. The term was first coined by American [[political scientist]] [[John W. Kingdon]] in his influential work ''[[John W. Kingdon|Agendas, Alternatives and Public Policies]]'' published in 1995.&lt;ref name="KINGDONBOOK" /&gt; Kingdon created the Multiple Streams Framework (MSF) which outlines that the policy process can be situated into problems, policy and politics. Political entrepreneurs are most active in the policy stream, creating solutions to potential problems and bringing them forth to the agenda setting process. The Multiple Streams Framework is a powerful tool to understand policy making and agenda setting. It was first created to analyze and understand agenda setting in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Knaggard"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knaggard|first1=Å|title=The Multiple Streams Framework and the problem broker|journal=Eur J Polit Res|date=2015|issue=54|pages=450–465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policy entrepreneurs are the most important actors in the Multiple Streams Framework, as they develop policy alternatives and couple them with problems to present solutions to policy makers at the right time. He himself describes them as "advocates who are willing to invest their resources - time, energy, reputation, money - to promote a position in return for anticipated future gain in the form of material, purposive or solidary benefits" &lt;ref name="KINGDONBOOK"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kingdon|first1=John|title=Agendas, Alternatives, and Public Policies|date=2003|publisher=Pearson|location=New York, NY|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Policy entrepreneurs use innovative ideas and non-traditional strategies to influence society, create opportunities, and promote desired policy outcomes. Policy entrepreneurship usually happens over three phases. It starts with a demand in the political landscape for some form of innovation involving a public good.&lt;ref name="MintromSolo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mintrom|first1=M|title=Policy Entrepreneurs and the Diffusion of Innovation|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=1997|volume=41|issue=3|page=738|doi=10.2307/2111674}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, an innovative policy instrument is proposed to supply that demand. Lastly, strategies are used such as team building, problem definition, and leadership by example to make certain that the innovation is placed on the agenda.&lt;ref name="MintromNorman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mintrom|first1=M|last2=Norman|first2=P|title=Policy Entrepreneurship and Policy Change|journal=Policy Studies Journal|date=2009|volume=37|issue=37|pages=649–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a public intellect who strives to assert themselves into many different topics and be publicly vocal, a policy entrepreneur will focus on specific topics and possibly work behind the scenes with state and [[political elite]].

==Origin==
The term entrepreneur is derived from the French word entreprendre, i.e. to undertake. The French economist Jean-Baptiste Say first coined the term in 1803 and defined an entrepreneur as an individual who "shifts economic resources out of an area of lower and into an area of higher productivity and greater yield". Many decades later, scholars gradually have expanded the use of the idea of entrepreneurship and adapted the concept from business to the public sector. John Kingdon (1984) was one of the earliest scholars to apply the term entrepreneurs to the public sector; he first coined the term "policy entrepreneur" in his work Agendas, Alternatives and Public Policies.&lt;ref name="KINGDONBOOK" /&gt; This new term has been addressed in other works but hasn't been systematically used by other political scientists in theories of policy change.&lt;ref name="MintromNorman" /&gt;

==Multiple streams framework==
Kingdon’s multiple-streams framework (MSF) has been frequently used since the publication of his book Agendas, Alternatives and Public Policies in 1984.&lt;ref name="KINGDONBOOK" /&gt; His model is an interpretation of the garbage can model of organizational choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=M. D.|last2=March|first2=J. G.|last3=Olsen|first3=J. P.|title=). Garbage can model of organizational choice|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|date=1972|volume=17|issue=1|doi=10.2307/2392088}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a garbage can model, organization is seen as groups of choices that seek out problems, issues and feelings that look for decisions and solutions and people willing to solve them. The multiple-streams adaption of this sees that policies can be created by joining together problems, policies and politics, all of which are seen as decision aspects in a policy process.

Government agendas are created when problems are recognized that have viable solutions that will be politically correct to make at the time of decision making.&lt;ref name="KINGDONBOOK" /&gt; Kingdon recognizes when these three aspects join together using the term "policy window". When a policy window is recognized and open, there is a potential for policy making to happen. Policy entrepreneurs function at this time as the action takers who take advantage of these windows while they are open.&lt;ref name="Saetren" /&gt; In the problems stream, conditions are defined as problems based on how an individual values and believes in it and how much of an impact will happen through change. In the policy stream, ideas and solutions are formulated through policy ideas usually developed by specialists to an issue. Policy development has better chance of surviving implementation if it has support from various different communities effected by the policy. The politics stream focuses on different elements that will effect a policy such as national mood, efforts by the people to campaign for change and legislative turnover.&lt;ref name="ZahariadisSOlo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zahariadis|first1=Nikolaos|title=The Shield of Heracles: Multiple streams and the emotional endowment effect|date=November 2014|doi=10.1111/1475-6765.12072|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-6765.12072/full|volume=54|journal=European Journal of Political Research|pages=466–481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multiple-streams framework is considered to provide the best conceptual insight in terms of the presence and influence of policy entrepreneurs and their role in emergence of policy windows&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ness|first1=Erik Christian|title=The Politics of Determining Merit Aid Eligibility Criteria: An Analysis of the Policy Process|journal=The Journal of Higher Education|date=2010|volume=81|issue=1|pages=33–60|doi=10.1353/jhe.0.0080}}&lt;/ref&gt; by using the three 'streams' to explain the gap between a problem getting attention and the adoption of an impactful solution. Kingdon claims these are not linear processes, instead, these three streams are to be treated as separate streams, able to happen in any order. He states that these three streams must come together at the same time.&lt;ref name="CairneyZ"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cairney|first1=Paul|last2=Zahariadis|first2=Nikolaos|title=Multiple streams analysis: A flexible metaphor presents an opportunity to operationalize agenda setting processes|date=2016|pages=1–21|url=https://paulcairney.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/cairney-zahariadis-multiple-streams-2016.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These streams are that a window of opportunity must exist, as well as a viable solution, combined with the motivation and the opportunity of the policy makers to select the solution. Many opportunities for policy change open, but most of them close before anyone even has a chance to take advantage because the attention of the policy agenda shifts dramatically.&lt;ref name="CairneyZ" /&gt;

Kingdon applied this reasoning to the political system of the United States. Since policy makers do not have the time to devote to detailed policies, they give the responsibility to civil servants who consult with think tanks and interest groups to produce policy solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cairney|first1=Paul|title=Policy Concepts in 1000 Words: Multiple Streams Analysis|date=October 2013|url=https://paulcairney.wordpress.com/2013/10/31/policy-concepts-in-1000-words-multiple-streams-analysis/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The likelihood of significant policy change is challenging to predict due to it requiring sustained attention, an acceptable solution, and some compromise of the political system. Building on Kingdon's work, Nikolaos Zahariadis defines it as a tool which explains how government policies are created with conditions of ambiguity.&lt;ref name="ZahariadisSOlo" /&gt;

Since 2000, Kingdon's book has been cited over 10,000 through Google Scholar and applied in over 1,900 times in peer reviewed articles.&lt;ref name="ZahariadisSOlo" /&gt;

==Idea to implementation==

In the multiple-streams frameworks, policy entrepreneurs do most of their work in the policy stream working on agenda setting ideas. The role of a policy entrepreneur is to first identify demand for innovation in the political landscape when a recognizable policy window is open. When this window is open, a policy entrepreneur has a limited amount of time to undergo the initial launch of proposing policy recommendations to supply the demand by utilizing their personal, network and institutional resources to take action on joining streams together on their idea through the policy stages. This is done by addressing issues and problems and coming up with solutions to them by creating policy alternatives into a product that they can present as a persuasive agenda that policy-makers should examine. They will implement persuasive strategies and techniques on the policy-makers to coerce their innovation onto the agenda. A successful policy entrepreneur will manage to get their issues onto a political agenda and potentially pass and influence a form of legislation that relates to their personal benefit. However, not every attempt will be successful. If unsuccessful, a policy entrepreneur may hold onto their agenda for a later time or even apply it to a different issue that they deem may work.&lt;ref name="Knaggard" /&gt;

These individuals have a credential that allows their opinions to be heard over others. This could be having expert knowledge on a topic or holding an important position of power in a corporation or special interest group that allows them to make decisions. A policy entrepreneur usually will have a large network of people with political influence that they utilize when pushing their idea forward. Persistence is essential for a policy entrepreneur to be successful. Many hours must be dedicated to their idea by giving speeches and talks, writing papers and speaking in front of government committees if they are to have success.&lt;ref name="KINGDONBOOK" /&gt;

Policy entrepreneurs are crucial actors in policy making, Kingdon himself explained that policy entrepreneurs are "advocates who are willing to invest their resources - time, energy, reputation, money - to promote a position in return for anticipated future gain in the form of material, purposive or solidary benefits".&lt;ref name="KINGDONBOOK" /&gt; Other political scientists have taken Kingdon's definition and expanded further. Michael Mintrom applied a [[Public policy|public policy perspective]] to the term stating, “they are individuals who through their creativity, strategy, networking, and persuasive argumentation are able to bring new policy ideas into the open and promote policy change".&lt;ref name="MintromSolo" /&gt; Years later, using a [[constructivism (international relations)|constructivist perspective]], Michael Mazarr added to this saying, “policy entrepreneurs can be seen as the human embodiment of the social construction of policy. Advocates determined, for one reason or another, to fight inertia, the bureaucracy, opposing interests, and anything else in their way to get the idea through the window [of opportunity] and into law or policy.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mazarr|first1=Michael|title=The Iraq War and Agenda-Setting|journal=Foreign Policy Analysis|date=2007|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–23|doi=10.1111/j.1743-8594.2007.00039.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews and criticisms==
Reviews of Agendas, Alternatives, and Public Policy display mixed opinions on the approaches and concepts created by Kingdon. Roger Cobb, former professor of political science at [[Brown University]] writes in an article for the [[Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law]] that Kingdon's garbage can model approach is a completely random decision-making tool that lacks content. Cobb states that the greatest contribution of the garbage can model is the creation of new terms like policy entrepreneur that help give the sense of focus on policy problems but then argues that Kingdon himself may not fully believe in what he has created. He criticizes that Kingdon makes a legitimate arguments for structure by writing about “predictable policy windows” that are attributable to different political cycles but makes rations that would contradict his whole argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1985|year=|title=Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law|url=|journal=Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law|volume=10|issue=2|pages=410–414|via=|last1=Cobb|first1=Roger|doi=10.1215/03616878-10-2-410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evelyn Brodkin, associate professor at [[The University of Chicago]] [[School of Social Service Administration]], writes in [[Political Science Quarterly]] that Kingdon's book provides a good analysis of how policy participants see their own role in influencing others, raising issue awareness and framing these issues for debate. She finds that his findings are beneficial for pursuing more empirical investigation and debate on different models of the agenda-setting process. In her criticism, Brodkin argues that the book fails to challenge criticisms of the pluralist theory that focus on discrepancies that illustrate how certain groups and issues systematically are excluded from the political process in which Kingdon's work is modelled on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1985|year=|title=Political Science Quarterly|url=|journal=Political Science Quarterly|volume=100|issue=1|pages=165–166|via=|last1=Brodkin|first1=Evelyn|doi=10.2307/2150882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frequent use of Kingdons agenda-setting framework in policy analysis is especially interesting because the book focuses solely on the United States. It can be argued that a framework developed exclusively on the basis of the examination of a single nation should not be able to generate useful insight in comparative research across the globe. Still, the MSF has been used in a large number of studies of subnational politics such as the European Union, the United Nations, and countries beyond the USA. Cairney and Zahariadis explain that this is because Kingdon's MSF possesses a language that is flexible enough to be relevant on a wide range of policy making processes.&lt;ref name="CairneyZ" /&gt; Its insights are universal enough to apply in most political systems.&lt;ref name="CairneyZ" /&gt;

Harald Sætren, professor at [[University of Bergen]] Department of Administration and Organization Theory, writes in [[Policy Sciences]] that one of the problems with the multiple-streams framework is that differing methods of finding issues and solutions potentially can effect how successful a policy entrepreneur can be in coupling policy streams.&lt;ref name="Saetren"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sætren|first1=Harald|title=From controversial policy idea to successful program implementation: the role of the policy entrepreneur, manipulation strategy, program design, institutions and open policy windows in relocating Norwegian central agencies|journal=Policy Sciences|date=2016|volume=49|issue=1|pages=71–88|doi=10.1007/s11077-016-9242-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] is a mechanical engineer that engaged in the debate about whether paddle wheels or screw propellors were more powerful for moving boats. He tested this by building one of each and using them in a channel to see which would tug the hardest. The point of his story is that he was engaged on the ground and not just researching in a lab. Policy entrepreneurs need to be practically involved in testing their theories if they want their recommendations to be considered &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Isambard Kingdom Brunel|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/primaryhistory/famouspeople/isambard_kingdom_brunel/|website=Primary History|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study done by [[Mark Beeson]] and Diane Stone, [[Ross Garnaut]] was examined in a role of a policy entrepreneur. Garnaut was a highly decorated scholar, recognized economist who was also an ambassador to China and a prime ministerial advisor in Australia. In his role as advisor to [[Bob Hawke|Prime Minister Hawke]], he wrote to him about problems with fixed exchange rates and instituting labour-market reform. The government went on to implement a radical program of economic liberalisation that included addressing some of the issues Garnaut consulted on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beeson|first1=M|last2=Stone|first2=D|title=The Changing Fortunes of a Policy Entrepreneur: The Case of Ross Garnaut|journal=Australian Journal of Political Science, 48(1), 1-14.|date=2013|volume=48|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1080/10361146.2012.760526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''R. Edward Freeman''' (born December 18, 1951) is an [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]] and [[professor]] of [[business administration]] at the [[Darden School]] of the [[University of Virginia]], particularly known for his work on [[stakeholder theory]] (1984) and on business works.

== Biography ==
Born in [[Columbus, Georgia]], Freeman received a B.A. in [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy]] from [[Duke University]] in 1973 and a Ph.D. in [[philosophy]] from [[Washington University]] in 1978.

He taught at the [[University of Minnesota]] and the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton School]], and is now Elis and Signe Olsson Professor of Business Administration at the Darden School of the University of Virginia. He is also academic director of the Business Roundtable Institute for Corporate Ethics, and director of the Darden's Olsson Center for Applied Ethics.&lt;ref name="F-CV 84"&gt;[http://www.csrhellas.org/portal/images/stories/files/1984_Freeman_CV.pdf Freeman's curriculum vitae]. Accessed Feb 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 Freeman served as president of the [[Society for Business Ethics]]. He is one of the executive editors of the journal [[Philosophy of Management]] and he serves as the editor for the Ruffin Series in Business Ethics from [[Oxford University Press]].

In 2001 Freeman was awarded the Pioneer Award for Lifetime Achievement by the [[World Resources Institute]] and by the [[Aspen Institute]], and in 2005 the Virginia State Council on Higher Education honored him with the Outstanding Faculty Award.

== Work ==
Freeman is particularly known for his work on [[stakeholder theory]] originally published in his 1984 book ''Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach''. He has (co)authored other books on corporate strategy and business ethics. Also recently he co-edited standard business textbooks such as ''The Portable MBA'' and the ''Blackwell's Handbook of Strategic Management.'' His latest book, ''Managing for Stakeholders'', was published 2007.

=== Stakeholder theory ===
[[Stakeholder theory]] is a theory of organizational management and [[business ethics]] that addresses morals and values in managing an organization. It was originally detailed by Freeman in the book ''Strategic Management: a Stakeholder Approach'', and identifies and models the groups which are [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s of a [[corporation]], and both describes and recommends methods by which management can give due regard to the interests of those groups. In short, it attempts to address the "Principle of Who or What Really Counts."&lt;ref name="REF 84"&gt;{{cite book |title=Strategic Management: a stakeholder approach |last=Freeman |first=R. Edward |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1984 |publisher=Pitman |location=Boston |isbn=0-273-01913-9 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the traditional view of the firm, the [[shareholder]] view, the shareholders or stockholders are the owners of the company, and the firm has a binding [[fiduciary]] duty to put their needs first, to increase value for them. However, stakeholder theory argues that there are other parties involved, including [[Government agency|governmental bodies]], [[political group]]s, [[trade association]]s, [[trade unions]], [[community|communities]], [[financier]]s, suppliers, [[employee]]s, and [[customer]]s. Sometimes even competitors are counted as stakeholders - their status being derived from their capacity to affect the firm and its other morally legitimate stakeholders. The nature of what is a stakeholder is highly contested (Miles, 2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miles|first=Samantha|title=Stakeholders: essentially contested or just confused?|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|year=2012|volume=108|issue=3|pages=285–298|doi=10.1007/s10551-011-1090-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; with several definitions existing in the academic literature (Miles, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miles|first=Samantha|title=Stakeholder Definitions: Profusion and Confusion|journal=EIASM 1st interdisciplinary conference on stakeholder, resources and value creation, IESE Business School, University of Navarra, Barcelona|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corporate social responsibility ===
[[Corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) &lt;ref&gt;D Wood, 'Corporate Social Performance Revisited' (1991) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/258977 16(4) The Academy of Management Review]&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of [[corporate]] [[Industry self-regulation|self-regulation]] integrated into a [[business model]]. CSR policy functions as a built-in, self-regulating mechanism whereby a business monitors and ensures its active compliance within the spirit of the law, ethical standards, and international [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s. CSR is a process with the aim to embrace responsibility for the company's actions and encourage a positive impact through its activities on the environment, consumers, employees, communities, [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] and all other members of the [[public sphere]] who may also be considered as stakeholders.

The term "corporate social responsibility" came into common use in the late 1960s and early 1970s after many multinational corporations formed the term [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]], meaning those on whom an organization's activities have an impact. It was used to describe corporate owners beyond [[shareholders]] as a result of an influential book by Freeman, ''Strategic management: a stakeholder approach'' in 1984.&lt;ref name="REF 84"/&gt; Proponents argue that corporations make more long term profits by operating with a perspective, while critics argue that CSR distracts from the economic role of businesses. Others argue CSR is merely [[Display window|window-dressing]], or an attempt to pre-empt the role of governments as a watchdog over powerful [[multinational corporations]]. Anticipation of such concepts appear in a publication that appeared in 1968 &lt;ref&gt;"Integrated structures in the Italian distribution system," Giuffre Editore, Milan, 1968, pp. VIII / 351&lt;/ref&gt; by Italian economist Giancarlo Pallavicini, creator of the "Method of the decomposition of the parameters" for the calculation of the results does not directly cost of business, regarding ethical issues, moral, social, cultural and environmental.&lt;ref&gt;"Universal Biographical Encyclopedia" Treccani, 2007 edition, Vol. 14, p. 617; "Treccani - Portal", Social sciences / economics / Biographies; Bancoper Annual Meeting, Bologna, 15.11.2008, Prefect Angelo Tranfaglia, "Profit and Social Responsibility", p. 12; "Finanza e Mercati", 3 February 2009, p. 11, Mara Consoli, "When ethics becomes a bargain"; News Chronicles, CNEL, Rome, 12.01.2009, Adelaide Mochi, "Socialis Awards and Corporate Social Responsibility"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
His criminal activities began in the early 1990s, following the [[Velvet Revolution]]. He co-founded the company Corado and amassed great wealth during the Czech [[voucher privatization]]. His activities and companies were monitored by the police since the mid-1990s, due to suspicion of illegal money transfers.&lt;ref name="novinky"/&gt;

In June 2005, the police raided his luxury villa in [[Černošice]] and arrested him in association with a planned murder of a [[customs officer]], fraud and criminal conspiracy. Krejčíř fled the house during the police intervention,&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-22/s-africa-charges-czech-fugitive-krejcir-with-attempted-murder.html|title=S.

== Attempted prison escape ==
A number of illegal items were discovered on 26 September 2015 in an apparent raid of a number of prison cells including that of Krejčíř. Amongst the items found were a pistol, ammunition, a knife, an item that appeared to be a [[Taser]], a [[pepper spray]] gun, screwdriver steel blade, ten cellphones, a memory stick, a diary which contained the names of witnesses and investigators in his cases and a sketch showing a detailed map of the prison building. The escape was to take place at his next court appearance in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Krejcir-escape-plan-foiled-20150927|title=Krejcir 'escape plan' foiled|date=29 September 2015|publisher=Media24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was revealed that a staggering R246 million ($18 million USD) had been made available to ensure the smooth escape of Krejčíř from prison. Three prison warders were paid R1.5 million to help expedite the prison break. Impeccable sources close to the investigation revealed that the three warders have already been identified and their arrest is imminent. Krejčíř has been moved to an underground isolation cell after it has been established that a helicopter was going to be used in the daring raid to free him. Some of the R246 million was used to pay for this helicopter to spirit Krejčíř away once he had escaped. A part of the money was also to be used to pay all the people, including the police, who were involved in the plan to spring him out of jail and some would have been used to pay for the landing rights for a chartered plane to fly him out of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/sundayindependent/r246m-for-krejcir-jailbreak-1.1924623#.VhKAZHqqqko|title=R246m for Krejcir jailbreak|date=4 October 2015|publisher=Sunday Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Judge]] of Tribunal in [[Johannesburg]] Colin Lamont, condemned him on 23 February, 2016 to 35 years in jail.

==In popular culture==
[[Gangster Ka]] a Czech film directed by Jan Pachl, is inspired by the story of Radovan Krejčíř. The movie premiered in 2015.

The '''Revolutions of 1989''' formed part of a [[revolutionary wave]] in the late 1980s and early 1990s that resulted in the end of communist rule in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] and beyond.

On 4 June 1989, the trade union [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] won an overwhelming victory in a [[Polish legislative election, 1989|partially free election in Poland]], leading to the peaceful fall of Communism in that country in the summer of 1989. Also in June 1989, Hungary began dismantling its section of the physical [[Iron Curtain]], leading to an exodus of East Germans through Hungary, which destabilised East Germany. This led to mass demonstrations in cities such as [[Leipzig]] and subsequently to the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in November 1989, which served as the symbolic gateway to [[German reunification]] in 1990.

The [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union dissolved]] in December 1991, resulting in eleven new countries ([[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Moldova]], [[Russia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Uzbekistan]]) which had declared their independence from the Soviet Union in the course of the year while the [[Baltic states]] ([[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]) [[Occupation of the Baltic states|regained]] their independence in September 1991. The rest of the Soviet Union, which constituted the bulk of the area, became the [[Russian Federation]] in December 1991. [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] abandoned Communism between 1990 and 1992. By 1992, Yugoslavia had split into five successor states, namely [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Slovenia]] and the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], which was later renamed [[Serbia and Montenegro]] in 2003 and eventually split in 2006 into two states, namely [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]. Serbia was then further split with the breakaway of the [[International recognition of Kosovo|partially recognised]] state of [[Kosovo]] in 2008. [[Czechoslovakia]] dissolved three years after the end of Communist rule, splitting peacefully into the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.cecl.gr/RigasNetwork/databank/Constitutions/Yugoslavia.html | publisher = CECL |date=1992-04-27 | accessdate = 2013-08-12 | place = [[Greece|GR]] | title = Constitution | contribution = Yugoslavia}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of these events made itself felt in several [[Socialist countries]]. Communism was abandoned in countries such as [[People's Republic of Kampuchea#Transition and State of Cambodia (1989–1992)|Cambodia]] (1991), [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] (1990), [[People's Republic of Mongolia|Mongolia]] (which in 1990 [[Mongolian legislative election, 1990|democratically re-elected]] a Communist government that ran the country until [[Mongolian legislative election, 1996|1996]]) and [[South Yemen]] (1990).

During the adoption of varying forms of [[market economy]], there was a [[1990s#Economics|general decline in living standards]] for many former Communist countries.&lt;ref name="Living standards CR"&gt;{{cite book|title= Vývoj vybraných ukazatelů životní úrovně v České republice v letech 1993&amp;nbsp;– 2008| year = 2009 | publisher= Odbor analýz a statistiky. Ministerstvo práce a sociálních věcí ČR |location= Praha|url= http://www.mpsv.cz/files/clanky/7421/ukazatele_zivotni_urovne.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political reforms were varied, but in only four countries were Communist parties able to retain a monopoly on power, namely China, [[Cuba]], [[Laos]] and [[Vietnam]] ([[North Korea]] went through a [[Constitution of North Korea#2009 Songun Constitution|constitutional change]] in 2009 that made it nominally no longer Communist, but still ''de facto'' organised on [[Stalinist]] lines). Many communist and socialist organisations in the West turned their guiding principles over to [[social democracy]] and [[democratic socialism]]. Communist parties in [[Italy]] and [[San Marino]] suffered and the [[Mani Pulite|reformation of the Italian political class]] took place in the early 1990s. In [[South America]], the [[Pink tide]] had instead begun, starting with [[Venezuela]] in 1999 and sweeping through the early 2000s. The [[Politics of Europe|European political landscape]] changed drastically, with several former Eastern Bloc countries joining [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]], resulting in stronger economic and social integration with Western Europe and the [[United States]].

== Background ==
=== Development of the Eastern Bloc ===
{{further|Eastern Bloc|List of socialist states}}
[[File:Fourthcongressofthepuwp.JPG|thumb|The fourth congress of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]], held in 1963]]
[[File:Kolejka.jpeg|thumb|Queue waiting to enter a store, a typical view in [[History of Poland (1945–1989)|Poland in the 1980s]]]]
[[Socialism]] had been gaining momentum among working class citizens of the world since the 19th century. These culminated in the early 20th century when several [[State (polity)|states]] and [[colonies]] formed their own [[communist parties]]. Many of the countries involved had [[hierarchical structure]]s with [[monarchic]] governments and [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] social structures with an established [[nobility]]. Socialism was undesirable within the circles of the [[ruling class]]es (which had begun to include industrial business leaders) in the late 19th/early 20th century states; as such, [[communism]] was repressed. Its champions suffered persecution while people were discouraged from adopting it. This had been the practice even in states which identified as exercising a multi-party system.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 saw the first [[communist state]] in the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR), when the [[Bolsheviks]] overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional government]].

During the period between the world wars, communism had been on the rise in many parts of the world, especially in towns and cities. This led to a series of purges in many countries to stifle the movement. Violent resistance to this repression led to an increase in support for communism in Central and Eastern Europe.

In the early stages of [[World War II]], both Nazi Germany and the USSR invaded and occupied the countries of Eastern Europe after the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. Germany then turned against and invaded the USSR: the battles of this [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] were the largest in history. The USSR joined with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and in conferences at [[Tehran Conference|Tehran]] and [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]], the Allies agreed that Central and Eastern Europe would be in the "Soviet sphere of political influence.". The USSR fought the Germans to a standstill and finally began driving them back, reaching Berlin before the end of the war. Nazi ideology was violently [[anti-communist]], and the Nazis brutally suppressed communist movements in the countries it occupied. Communists played a large part in the [[Resistance during World War II|resistance to the Nazis]] in these countries. As the Soviets forced the Germans back, they assumed temporary control of these devastated areas.

After World War II, the Soviets ensured that communists loyal to Moscow took power in the countries it occupied. The Soviets retained troops throughout these territories. The [[Cold War]] saw these states, bound together by the [[Warsaw Pact]], have continuing tensions with the capitalist west, bound together by [[NATO]]. The [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] established communism in [[China]] in 1949.

During the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], a spontaneous nationwide anti-authoritarian revolt, the Soviet Union invaded Hungary to assert control. Similarly, in 1968, the USSR repressed the [[Prague Spring]] by organizing the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]].

=== Emergence of Solidarity in Poland ===
{{main|Solidarity (Polish trade union)}}
Labour turmoil in Poland during 1980 had led to the formation of the independent [[trade union]], [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], led by [[Lech Wałęsa]], which over time became a political force. On 13 December 1981, Polish Prime Minister [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] started a crackdown on Solidarity by declaring [[martial law in Poland]], suspending the union, and temporarily imprisoning all of its leaders.

=== Mikhail Gorbachev ===
{{main|Mikhail Gorbachev|Perestroika|Glasnost|Democratisation in the Soviet Union}}
Although several Eastern bloc countries had attempted some abortive, limited economic and political reform since the 1950s (e.g. the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and [[Prague Spring]] of 1968), the ascension of reform-minded Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in 1985 signaled the trend toward greater liberalization. During the mid-1980s, a younger generation of Soviet [[apparatchiks]], led by Gorbachev, began advocating fundamental reform in order to reverse years of [[Brezhnev stagnation]]. After decades of growth, the Soviet Union was now facing a period of severe economic decline and needed Western technology and credits{{clarify|date=March 2017}} to make up for its increasing backwardness. The costs of maintaining its military, the [[KGB]], subsidies to foreign client states etc., further strained the moribund [[Soviet economy]].

The first signs of major reform came in 1986 when Gorbachev launched a policy of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) in the Soviet Union, and emphasized the need for ''[[perestroika]]'' (economic restructuring). By the spring of 1989, the Soviet Union had not only experienced lively media debate, but had also held its first multi-candidate elections in the newly established [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]]. While glasnost ostensibly advocated openness and political criticism, these were only permitted within a narrow spectrum dictated by the state. The general public in the [[Eastern bloc]] was still subject to [[secret police]] and political repression.

Gorbachev urged his Central and Southeast European counterparts to imitate ''perestroika'' and ''glasnost'' in their own countries. However, while reformists in Hungary and Poland were emboldened by the force of liberalization spreading from the east, other [[Eastern bloc]] countries remained openly skeptical and demonstrated aversion to reform. Believing Gorbachev's reform initiatives would be short-lived, hardline communist rulers like [[East Germany]]'s [[Erich Honecker]], Bulgaria's [[Todor Zhivkov]], Czechoslovakia's [[Gustáv Husák]] and Romania's [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] obstinately ignored the calls for change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://countrystudies.us/romania/75.htm | contribution = Romania – Soviet Union and Eastern Europe | place = US | publisher = Library of Congress | title = Country studies}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "When your neighbor puts up new wallpaper, it doesn't mean you have to too," declared one East German politburo member.&lt;ref name = "Steele" /&gt;

== Leadup to revolution ==
By the late 1980s, people in the [[Caucasus]] and [[Baltic states]] were demanding more autonomy from [[Moscow]], and the Kremlin was losing some of its control over certain regions and elements in the [[Soviet Union]]. In November 1988, the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic]] issued a [[Estonian Sovereignty Declaration|declaration of sovereignty]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-11-17/news/mn-458_1_soviet-union|title=Parliament in Estonia Declares 'Sovereignty'|work=latimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would eventually lead to other states making similar declarations of autonomy.

The [[Chernobyl disaster]] in April 1986 had major political and social effects that catalyzed or at least partially caused the revolutions of 1989. One political result of the disaster was the greatly increased significance of the new Soviet policy of [[glasnost]].&lt;ref name="ShlyGlasnost"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00139157.1992.9931445 |title=Chernobyl andGlasnost: The Effects of Secrecy on Health and Safety |year=1992 |last1=Shlyakhter |first1=Alexander |last2=Wilson |first2=Richard |journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PetrynaSarc"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1525/can.1995.10.2.02a00030 |title=Sarcophagus: Chernobyl in Historical Light |year=1995 |last1=Petryna |first1=Adriana |journal=Cultural Anthropology |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to establish the total economic cost of the disaster. According to Gorbachev, the Soviet Union spent 18 billion rubles (the equivalent of US$18 billion at that time) on containment and decontamination, virtually bankrupting itself.&lt;ref name="GorbachevBoC"&gt;Gorbachev, Mikhail (1996), interview in Johnson, Thomas, ''{{YouTube|dd-QBnAd5qY|The Battle of Chernobyl}}'', [film], Discovery Channel, retrieved 19 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regime changes outside of Eastern Europe ==
{{see also|Third Wave Democracy}}
In February 1986, in one of the first peaceful, mass-movement revolutions against a dictatorship, the [[People Power Revolution]] in the [[Philippines]] peacefully overthrew dictator [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and inaugurated [[Cory Aquino]] as president.

The [[domino effect]] of the revolutions of 1989 affected other regimes as well. The [[South Africa]]n [[apartheid]] regime and [[Pinochet]]'s [[military dictatorship]] in Chile were gradually dismantled during the 1990s as the West withdrew their funding and diplomatic support. [[Argentina]], [[Ghana]], [[Indonesia]], [[Nicaragua]], [[South Korea]], [[Suriname]], [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan), and [[North Yemen|North]] and [[South Yemen]], among many others, elected democratic governments.

Exact tallies of the number of democracies vary depending on the criteria used for assessment, but by some measures by the late 1990s there were well over 100 democracies in the world, a marked increase in just a few decades.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

== Solidarity's impact grows ==
{{main|Solidarity (Polish trade union)}}
[[File:WieczorWroclawia20marca1981.jpg|thumb|20–21 March 1981, issue of ''Wieczór Wrocławia'' (''This Evening in [[Wrocław]]'') shows blank spaces remaining after the government censor pulled articles from page 1 (right, "What happened at [[Bydgoszcz]]?") and from the last page (left, "Country-wide strike alert"), leaving only their titles as the printers—[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity-trade-union]] members—decided to run the newspaper with blank spaces intact and the bottom of page 1 of this master copy bears the hand-written Solidarity confirmation of that decision]]

Throughout the mid-1980s, [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] persisted solely as an underground organization, supported by the Catholic Church. However, by the late 1980s, Solidarity became sufficiently strong to frustrate [[Wojciech Jaruzelski|Jaruzelski's]] attempts at reform, and [[1988 Polish strikes|nationwide strikes in 1988]] forced the government to open dialogue with Solidarity. On 9 March 1989, both sides agreed to a [[bicameral legislature]] called the [[National Assembly (Poland)|National Assembly]]. The already existing [[Sejm]] would become the lower house. The Senate would be elected by the people. Traditionally a ceremonial office, the presidency was given more powers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2facts.com Poland:Major Political Reform Agreed], ''Facts on File World News Digest'', 24 March 1989. Facts on File News Services. 6 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Polish Round Table Agreement]]).

By 1989, the Soviet Union had repealed the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]] in favor of non-intervention in the internal affairs of its [[Warsaw Pact]] allies, termed the [[Sinatra Doctrine]] in a joking reference to the [[Frank Sinatra]] song "[[My Way (song)|My Way]]". Poland became the first Warsaw Pact country to break free of Soviet domination.

== National political movements ==
=== China ===
{{main|Tiananmen Square protests of 1989}}
New Chinese leader [[Deng Xiaoping]] (1982–1987) developed the concept of [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]] and local [[Socialist market economy|market economy]] around 1984, but the policy stalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | date = 3 February 2012 | url = http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90780/7719657.html | title = 'Market fundamentalism' is unpractical | newspaper = People's Daily | publisher = Central Committee of the Communist Party | place = [[China|CN]] | accessdate = 13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Chinese student demonstrations, which directly preceded the Beijing protests of 1989, took place in December 1986 in [[Hefei]]. The students called for campus elections, the chance to study abroad and greater availability of Western pop culture. Their protests took advantage of the loosening political atmosphere and included rallies against the slow pace of reform. [[Hu Yaobang]], a protégé of Deng Xiaoping and a leading advocate of reform, was blamed for the protests and forced to resign as the CCP general secretary in January 1987. In the "Anti Bourgeois Liberalization Campaign", Hu would be further denounced.

The Tiananmen Square protests were sparked by the death of Hu Yaobang on 15 April 1989. By the eve of Hu's state funeral, some 100,000 students had gathered at [[Tiananmen Square]] to observe it; however, no leaders emerged from the [[Great Hall of the People|Great Hall]]. The movement lasted for seven weeks.&lt;ref name= "Zhao153"&gt;{{Citation | first = Dingxin | last = Zhao | title = The Power of Tiananmen: State-Society Relations and the 1989 Beijing Student Movement | place = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | year = 2001 | ISBN = 0-226-98260-2 | page = 153}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorbachev's visit to China on 15 May during the protests brought many foreign news agencies to Beijing, and their sympathetic portrayals of the protesters helped galvanize a spirit of liberation among the Central, South-East and Eastern Europeans who were watching. The Chinese leadership, particularly Communist Party general secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]], having begun earlier than the Soviets to radically reform the economy, was open to political reform, but not at the cost of a potential return to the disorder of the [[Cultural Revolution]].

The movement lasted from Hu's death on 15 April until tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square on 4 June 1989. In Beijing, the military response to the protest by the PRC government left many civilians in charge of clearing the square of the dead and severely injured. The exact number of casualties is not known and many different estimates exist.

On 7 July 1989, President Mikhail Gorbachev implicitly renounced the use of force against other Soviet-bloc nations. Speaking to members of the 23-nation Council of Europe, Mr. Gorbachev made no direct reference to the so-called [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], under which Moscow has asserted the right to use force to prevent a Warsaw Pact member from leaving the Communist fold, but stated 'Any interference in domestic affairs and any attempts to restrict the sovereignty of states—friends, allies or any others—are inadmissible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/07/world/gorbachev-spurns-the-use-of-force-in-eastern-europe.html?scp=714&amp;sq=Hungary&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=8324637C96A56F9E0671EC017DB71D98 | work=The New York Times | first=James M. | last = Markham | title=Gorbachev spurns the use of force in Eastern Europe | date=7 July 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[1988 Polish strikes|wave of strikes]] hit Poland in April and May 1988, and a second wave began on 15 August that year when a strike broke out at the [[July Manifesto]] coal mine in [[Jastrzębie-Zdrój]], the workers demanding the re-legalisation of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]. Over the next few days, sixteen other mines went on strike followed by a number of shipyards, including on 22 August, the [[Gdansk Shipyard]], famous as the epicentre of the [[History of Solidarity|1980 industrial unrest]] that spawned Solidarity.{{Sfn | Wałęsa | 1991 | p = 151}} On 31 August 1988 [[Lech Wałęsa]], the leader of Solidarity, was invited to Warsaw by the Communist authorities, who had finally agreed to talks.{{Sfn | Wałęsa | 1991 | p = 157}} On 18 January 1989 at a stormy session of the Tenth Plenary Session of the ruling [[Polish United Workers' Party|United Workers' Party]], General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], the First Secretary, managed to get party backing for formal negotiations with Solidarity leading to its future legalisation, although this was achieved only by threatening the resignation of the entire party leadership if thwarted.{{Sfn | Wałęsa | 1991 | p = 174}} On 6 February 1989 formal Round Table discussions began in the Hall of Columns in Warsaw. On 4 April 1989 the historic [[Polish Round Table Agreement|Round Table Agreement]] was signed legalising Solidarity and setting up partly free [[Polish legislative election, 1989|parliamentary elections]] to be held on 4 June 1989 (incidentally, the day following the midnight crackdown on Chinese protesters in Tiananmen Square). A political earthquake followed. The victory of Solidarity surpassed all predictions. Solidarity candidates captured all the seats they were allowed to compete for in the [[Sejm]], while in the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]] they captured 99 out of the 100 available seats (with the one remaining seat taken by an independent candidate). At the same time, many prominent Communist candidates failed to gain even the minimum number of votes required to capture the seats that were reserved for them.

On 15 August 1989, the Communists' two longtime coalition partners, the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]] (ZSL) and the [[Democratic Party (Poland)|Democratic Party]] (SD), broke their alliance with the PZPR and announced their support for Solidarity. The last Communist Prime Minister of Poland, General [[Czesław Kiszczak]], said he would resign to allow a non-Communist to form an administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/15/world/poland-s-premier-offering-to-yield-to-non-communist.html?scp=187&amp;sq=Poland&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=1619ADC23679717BAA7BEEB89D42F7C7 | work=The New York Times | first=John | last=Tagliabue | title=Poland's premier offering to yield to non-Communist | date=15 August 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Solidarity was the only other political grouping that could possibly form a government, it was virtually assured that a Solidarity member would become prime minister.

Following Poland's lead, Hungary was next to switch to a non-Communist government. Although Hungary had achieved some lasting economic reforms and limited political liberalization during the 1980s, major reforms only occurred following the replacement of [[János Kádár]] as General Secretary of the Communist Party on 23 May 1988 with [[Károly Grósz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/23/world/hungarian-party-replaces-kadar-with-his-premier.html?scp=135&amp;sq=Hungary&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=E283E53C9144CEB5DC839A7740A35E80 | work=The New York Times | first=Henry | last=Kamm | title=Hungarian Party replace Kadar with his premier | date= 23 May 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 November 1988 [[Miklós Németh]] was appointed Prime Minister.

Mass demonstrations on 15 March, the National Day, persuaded the regime to begin negotiations with the emergent non-Communist political forces. [[Hungarian Round Table Talks|Round Table talks]] began on 22 April and continued until the Round Table agreement was signed on 18 September. The talks involved the Communists (MSzMP) and the newly emerging independent political forces [[Fidesz – Hungarian Civic Union|Fidesz]], the [[Alliance of Free Democrats]] (SzDSz), the [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]] (MDF), the [[Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party|Independent Smallholders' Party]], the [[National Peasant Party (Hungary)|Hungarian People's Party]], the Endre Bajcsy-Zsilinszky Society, and the Democratic Trade Union of Scientific Workers. At a later stage the [[Democratic Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] and the [[Christian Democratic People's Party (Hungary)|Christian Democratic People's Party]] (KDNP) were invited.{{Sfn | Falk | 2003 | p = 147}} It was at the talks that a number of Hungary's future political leaders emerged, including [[László Sólyom]], [[József Antall]], [[György Szabad]], [[Péter Tölgyessy]] and [[Viktor Orbán]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = József | last = Bayer | contribution-url =  http://www.europainstitut.hu/pdf/bayer22.pdf | contribution = The Process of Political System Change in Hungary | title = Schriftenreihe | publisher = Europa Institutes | place = Budapest, [[Hungary|HU]] | year = 2003 | page = 180}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May 1989, the first visible cracks in the [[Iron Curtain]] appeared when [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]] began [[Removal of Hungary's border fence with Austria|dismantling its {{convert |240|km| adj =on}} long border fence with Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Stokes | first = G | title = The Walls Came Tumbling Down | page = 131 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This increasingly destabilized the [[East Germany|GDR]] and [[Czechoslovakia]] over the summer and autumn as thousands of their citizens illegally crossed over to the West through the Hungarian-Austrian border.

The Round Table agreement of 18 September encompassed six draft laws that covered an overhaul of the [[Constitution of Hungary|Constitution]], establishment of a [[Constitutional Court of Hungary|Constitutional Court]], the functioning and management of political parties, multiparty elections for National Assembly deputies, the penal code and the law on penal procedures (the last two changes represented an additional separation of the Party from the state apparatus).{{Sfn | Heenan | Lamontagne | 1999 | p = 13}}{{Sfn | De Nevers | 2003 | p = 130}} The electoral system was a compromise: about half of the deputies would be elected proportionally and half by the majoritarian system.{{Sfn | Elster | Offe | Preuss | 1998 | p = 66}} A weak presidency was also agreed upon, but no consensus was attained on who should elect the president (parliament or the people) and when this election should occur (before or after parliamentary elections).

{{main|Die Wende|German reunification|Peaceful Revolution}}
[[File:BerlinWall-BrandenburgGate.jpg|thumb|[[Berlin Wall]] at the [[Brandenburg Gate]], 10 November 1989]]
On 2 May 1989, Hungary started dismantling its barbed-wire border with [[Austria]], opening a large hole through the Iron Curtain to the West that was used by a growing number of East Germans. By the end of September 1989, more than 30,000 East Germans had escaped to the West before the GDR denied travel to Hungary, leaving the CSSR ([[Czechoslovakia]]) as the only neighboring state where East Germans could escape to. Thousands of East Germans tried to reach the West by occupying the West German diplomatic facilities in other Central and Eastern European capitals, notably the [[Prague Embassy]] and the Hungarian Embassy where thousands camped in the muddy garden from August to November waiting for German political reform. The GDR closed the border to the CSSR on 3 October, thereby isolating itself from all neighbors. Having been shut off from their last chance for escape, an increasing number of East Germans participated in the [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|Monday demonstrations]] in Leipzig on 4, 11, and 18 September, each attracting 1,200 to 1,500 demonstrators; many were arrested and beaten. However, the people refused to be intimidated. On 25 September, the protests attracted 8,000 demonstrators.

After the fifth successive Monday demonstration in Leipzig on 2 October attracted 10,000 protesters, [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (SED) leader [[Erich Honecker]] issued a ''shoot and kill'' order to the military.&lt;ref name = "Pritchard"&gt;{{cite book|title=Reconstructing education: East German schools and universities after unification| first = Rosalind MO | last = Pritchard|page =10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communists prepared a huge police, militia, [[Stasi]], and work-combat troop presence and there were rumors a Tiananmen Square-style massacre was being planned for the following Monday's demonstration on 9 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Germany, 1918–2000: the divided nation| first =Mary | last = Fulbrook|page = 256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 and 7 October, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] visited East Germany to mark the 40th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic, and urged the East German leadership to accept reform. A famous quote of his is rendered in German as "Wer zu spät kommt, den bestraft das Leben" ("He who is too late is punished by life"). However, Honecker remained opposed to internal reform, with his regime even going so far as forbidding the circulation of Soviet publications that it viewed as subversive.

In spite of rumors that the Communists were planning a massacre on 9 October, 70,000 citizens demonstrated in Leipzig that Monday, and the authorities on the ground refused to open fire. This victory of the people facing down the Communists' guns encouraged more citizens to take to the streets. The following Monday, 16 October, 120,000 people demonstrated on the streets of Leipzig.

[[Erich Honecker]] had hoped that the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany|Soviet troops]] stationed in the [[East Germany|GDR]], as by the [[Warsaw Pact]], would restore the communist government and suppress the civilian protests. By 1989 the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]] deemed it impractical for the Soviet Union to [[Sinatra Doctrine|continue asserting its control]] over the [[Eastern Bloc]], and so it took a neutral stance regarding the events happening in East Germany. Soviet troops stationed in eastern Europe were under strict instructions from the Soviet leadership not to intervene in the political affairs of the Eastern Bloc nations and had to remain in their barracks. Faced with ongoing civil unrest, the SED deposed Honecker on 18 October and replaced him with the number-two-man in the regime, [[Egon Krenz]]. However, the demonstrations kept growing and on Monday 23 October the Leipzig protesters numbered 300,000 and remained as large the following week. The border to Czechoslovakia was opened again on 1 November, but the Czechoslovak authorities soon let all East Germans travel directly to West Germany without further bureaucratic ado, thus lifting their part of the Iron Curtain on 3 November. On 4 November the authorities decided to authorize a demonstration in Berlin and were faced with the [[Alexanderplatz demonstration]] where half a million citizens converged on the capital demanding freedom in the biggest protest the GDR ever witnessed. Unable to stem the ensuing flow of refugees to the West through Czechoslovakia, the East German authorities eventually caved in to public pressure by allowing East German citizens to enter West Berlin and West Germany directly, via existing border points, on 9 November 1989, without having properly briefed the border guards. Triggered by the erratic words of regime spokesman [[Günter Schabowski]] in a TV press conference, stating that the planned changes were in effect "immediately, without delay," hundreds of thousands of people took advantage of the opportunity. The guards were quickly overwhelmed by the growing crowds of people demanding to be let out into West Berlin. After receiving no feedback from their superiors, the guards, unwilling to use force, relented and opened the gates to West Berlin. Soon new crossing points were forced open in the [[Berlin Wall]] by the people, and sections of the wall were literally torn down as this symbol of oppression was overwhelmed. The bewildered guards were unaware of what was happening and meekly stood by as the East Germans took to the wall with hammers and chisels.

On 13 November, GDR Prime Minister [[Willi Stoph]] and his entire cabinet resigned. A new government was formed under a considerably more liberal Communist, [[Hans Modrow]]. On 1 December, the [[Volkskammer]] removed the SED's leading role from the constitution of the GDR. On 3 December Krenz resigned as leader of the SED; he resigned as head of state three days later. On 7 December Round Table talks opened between the SED and other political parties. On 16 December 1989, the SED was dissolved and refounded as the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|SED-PDS]], abandoning Marxism-Leninism and becoming a mainstream democratic socialist party.

On 15 January 1990, the Stasi's headquarters was stormed by protesters. Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany until free elections were held on 18 March 1990—the first held in that part of Germany since 1933. The SED, renamed the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]], was heavily defeated. [[Lothar de Maizière]] of the East German Christian Democratic Union became Prime Minister on 4 April 1990 on a platform of speedy [[German reunification|reunification]] with the West. The two Germanies were reunified on 3 October 1990.

The Kremlin's willingness to abandon such a strategically vital ally marked a dramatic shift by the Soviet superpower and a fundamental paradigm change in international relations, which until 1989 had been dominated by the East-West divide running through Berlin itself. The last Russian troops left the territory of the former GDR, now part of a reunited [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], on 1 September 1994.

=== Czechoslovakia ===
{{main|Velvet Revolution}}
[[File:Prague November89 - Wenceslas Monument.jpg|thumb|Protests beneath the monument in [[Prague]]'s [[Wenceslas Square]]]]
[[File:Bratislava Slovakia 213.JPG|thumb|upright=0.75|Memorial of the [[Velvet Revolution]] in [[Bratislava]] ([[SNP Square (Bratislava)|Námestie SNP]]), [[Slovakia]]]]
The "Velvet Revolution" was a non-violent revolution in Czechoslovakia that saw the overthrow of the Communist government. On 17 November 1989 (Friday), riot police suppressed a peaceful student demonstration in Prague, although controversy continues over whether anyone died that night. That event sparked a series of popular demonstrations from 19 November to late December. By 20 November the number of peaceful protesters assembled in Prague had swelled from 200,000 the previous day to an estimated half-million. Five days later, the Letná Square protest held 800,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.denik.cz/z_domova/demonstrace-na-letne-pred-25-lety-urychlily-kapitulaci-komunistu-20141123.html | title = Demonstrace na letne pred 25 lety urychlily kapitulaci komunistu | language = cs| place = [[Czhec|CZ]] | newspaper = Denik}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 November, the entire Communist Party leadership, including general secretary [[Miloš Jakeš]], resigned. A two-hour general strike, involving all citizens of Czechoslovakia, was successfully held on 27 November.

With the collapse of other Communist governments, and increasing street protests, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia announced on 28 November 1989 that it would relinquish power and dismantle the single-party state. Barbed wire and other obstructions were removed from the border with West Germany and Austria in early December. On 10 December, President [[Gustáv Husák]] appointed the first largely non-Communist government in Czechoslovakia since 1948, and resigned. [[Alexander Dubček]] was elected speaker of the federal parliament on 28 December and [[Václav Havel]] the President of Czechoslovakia on 29 December 1989. In June 1990 Czechoslovakia held its first democratic elections since 1946. On 27 June 1991 the last Soviet troops were withdrawn from Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=20 Years After Soviet Soldiers Left the Czech Republic, Russians Move In|url = https://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2011/06/28/soviet-soldiers-left-czechoslovakia-20-years-ago-ordinary-well-off-russians-to-move-in/ | newspaper= The Wall Street Journal|date=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bulgaria ===
In October and November 1989, demonstrations on ecological issues were staged in Sofia, where demands for political reform were also voiced. The demonstrations were suppressed, but on 10 November 1989 (the day after the Berlin Wall was breached) Bulgaria's long-serving leader [[Todor Zhivkov]] was ousted by his Politburo. He was succeeded by a considerably more liberal Communist, former foreign minister [[Petar Mladenov]]. Moscow apparently approved the leadership change, as Zhivkov had been opposed to Gorbachev's policies. The new regime immediately repealed restrictions on free speech and assembly, which led to the first mass demonstration on 17 November, as well as the formation of anti-communist movements. Nine of them united as the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]] (UDF) on 7 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.sds.bg/about/history | title = History of the UDF | language = bg | publisher = SDS | place = [[Bulgaria|BG]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UDF was not satisfied with Zhivkov's ouster, and demanded additional democratic reforms, most importantly the removal of the constitutionally mandated leading role of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]].

Mladenov announced on 11 December 1989 that the Communist Party would abandon its monopoly on power, and that multiparty elections would be held the following year. In February 1990, the Bulgarian legislature deleted the portion of the constitution about the "leading role" of the Communist Party. Eventually, it was decided that a round table on the Polish model would be held in 1990 and elections held by June 1990. The round table took place from 3 January to 14 May 1990, at which an agreement was reached on the transition to democracy. The Communist Party abandoned Marxism–Leninism in April 1990 and renamed itself as the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]]. In June 1990 the first free elections since 1931 were held, won by the Bulgarian Socialist Party.

=== Romania ===
{{main|Romanian Revolution}}
After having suppressed the [[Braşov Rebellion]] in 1987, [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] was re-elected for another five years as leader of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR) in November 1989, signalling that he intended to ride out the anti-Communist uprisings sweeping the rest of Europe. As Ceauşescu prepared to go on a state visit to Iran, his [[Securitate]] ordered the arrest and exile of a local Hungarian [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] minister, [[László Tőkés]], on 16 December, for sermons offending the regime. Tőkés was seized, but only after serious rioting erupted. [[Timişoara]] was the first city to react on 16 December and civil unrest continued for five days.

Returning from Iran, Ceauşescu ordered a mass rally in his support outside Communist Party headquarters in Bucharest on 21 December. However, to his shock the crowd booed and jeered him as he spoke. Years of repressed dissatisfaction boiled to the surface throughout the Romanian populace and even among elements in Ceauşescu's own government, and the demonstrations spread throughout the country.

At first the security forces obeyed Ceauşescu's orders to shoot protesters. However, on the morning of 22 December, the Romanian military suddenly changed sides. This came after it was announced that defense minister [[Vasile Milea]] had committed suicide after being unmasked as a traitor. Believing Milea had actually been murdered, the rank-and-file soldiers went over virtually ''en masse'' to the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cornel|first=Ban|title=Sovereign Debt, Austerity, and Regime Change: The Case of Nicolae Ceausescu’s Romania|date=November 2012|publisher=East European Politics &amp; Societies|page=34|url=http://0-web.a.ebscohost.com.libraries.colorado.edu/ehost/detail/detail?sid=b54ec8d0-8831-43ba-93d1-3f55b98fb916%40sessionmgr4002&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4112&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=83866105|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160518013101/http://0-web.a.ebscohost.com.libraries.colorado.edu/ehost/detail/detail?sid=b54ec8d0-8831-43ba-93d1-3f55b98fb916%40sessionmgr4002&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4112&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=83866105|dead-url=yes|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Army tanks began moving towards the Central Committee building with crowds swarming alongside them. The rioters forced open the doors of the Central Committee building in an attempt to capture Ceauşescu and his wife, [[Elena Ceauşescu|Elena]], coming within a few meters of the couple. However, they managed to escape via a helicopter waiting for them on the roof of the building. The revolution resulted in 1,104 deaths. Unlike its kindred parties in the Warsaw Pact, the PCR simply melted away; no present-day Romanian party claiming to be its successor has ever been elected to the legislature since the change of system.

Although elation followed the flight of the Ceauşescus, uncertainty surrounded their fate. On Christmas Day, Romanian television showed the Ceauşescus facing a hasty trial, and then undergoing [[summary execution]]. An interim [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] Council led by [[Ion Iliescu]] took over and announced elections for April 1990, the first free elections held in Romania since 1937. However, they were postponed until 20 May 1990. Over 1,000 people died during the Romanian Revolution, out of which 100 where children and the youngest was only one month. The Romanian dictator, Nicolae Ceauşescu, and his wife, Elena Ceauşescu, were executed by firing squad after a very brief trial. The Romanian Revolution was the bloodiest of the revolutions of 1989.

=== Mongolia ===
{{main|Mongolian Revolution of 1990}}
Mongolia declared independence in 1911 after the collapse of the [[Qing dynasty]]. The [[Mongolian People's Party]] [[Outer Mongolian Revolution of 1921|took power]] in 1921 and the party renamed itself the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Constitutions of the Communist World|editor-first=William B.|editor-last=Simons|publisher=BRILL|year=1980|ISBN=9028600701|pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the years, Mongolia was closely aligned with the Soviet Union. After [[Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal]] left in 1984, the new leadership under [[Jambyn Batmönkh]] implemented economic reforms, but failed to appeal to those who, in late 1989, wanted broader changes,&lt;ref name="Kaplonski" /&gt; which led to the "Mongolian Revolution", a democratic [[Nonviolent revolution|peaceful]] revolution that started with demonstrations and [[hunger strike]]s that ended 70-years of [[socialism]] and eventually moved towards democracy. It was spearheaded by mostly younger people demonstrating on [[Sükhbaatar Square]] in the capital [[Ulaanbaatar]]. It ended with the [[authoritarian]] government resigning without bloodshed. Some of the main organizers were [[Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj]], [[Sanjaasürengiin Zorig]], [[Erdeniin Bat-Üül]], and [[Bat-Erdeniin Batbayar]].

During the period of the morning of 10 December 1989, the first public demonstration occurred in front of the Youth Cultural Center in the capital of Ulaanbaatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=G.|first=Dari|title=

The protesters called for Mongolia to adopt [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]]. Dissident leaders demanded free elections and economic reform, but within the context of a "human democratic socialism".&lt;ref name="Kaplonski"/&gt; The protesters injected a nationalist element into the protests by using traditional [[Mongolian script]]&amp;mdash;which most Mongolians could not read&amp;mdash;as a symbolic repudiation of the political system which had imposed the [[Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet]]. In late December 1989, demonstrations increased when news came of [[Garry Kasparov]]'s interview to ''[[Playboy]]'', suggesting that the Soviet Union could improve its economic health by selling Mongolia to China.&lt;ref name="Kaplonski"&gt;{{cite book|title=Truth, History, and Politics in Mongolia: The Memory of Heroes|first=Christopher|last=Kaplonski|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|pages=51, 56, 60, 64–65, 67, 80–82|ISBN=1134396732}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 January 1990, the protesters, having grown from three hundred to some 1,000, met on square in front of Lenin Museum which was named as Freedom Square since then in [[Ulaanbaatar]]. A demonstration on [[Sükhbaatar Square]] on 21 January (in weather of -30&amp;nbsp;C) followed. Protesters carried banners alluding to Chinggis Khaan (also referred to [[Genghis Khan]]), rehabilitating a figure which Soviet schooling neglected to praise.&lt;ref name="Fineman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-24/news/mn-609_1_rock-music/2|title=Mongolia Reform Group Marches to Rock Anthem|first=Mark|last=Fineman|date=1990-01-24|accessdate=2012-12-26|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|quote=Mongolia-watchers in Beijing said that... the democracy movement is rooted more in nationalism than in dissent....

Opposition parties were not able to nominate enough candidates. The opposition nominated 346 candidates for the 430 seats in the Great Hural (upper house). The [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]] MPRP won 357 seats in the Great Hural and 31 out of 53 seats in the Small Hural (which was later abolished) as well.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Staisch, Werner M. Prohl, ''Dschingis Khan lächelt'', Bonn 1998, p.38ff&lt;/ref&gt; The MPRP enjoyed a strong position in the countryside. The [[State Great Khural]] first met on 3 September 1990 and elected a president (MPRP), vice president ([[Mongolian Social Democratic Party|Social Democrat]]) who was also a chairman of the Baga Hural, prime minister (MPRP), and 50 members to the Baga Hural (lower house). In November 1991, the People's Great Hural began discussion on a new constitution, which entered into force on 12 February 1992. In addition, the new constitution restructured the legislative branch of government, creating a unicameral legislature, the State Great Hural (SGH). The MPRP retained its majority, but lost the 1996 elections. The final Russian troops, which had stationed in Mongolia in 1966, fully withdrew in December 1992.

=== Yugoslavia ===
{{main|Breakup of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Wars}}
The [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was not a part of the Warsaw Pact but pursued [[Titoism|its own version of "Communism"]] under [[Josip Broz Tito]]. It was a multi-ethnic state which Tito was able to maintain through a doctrine of "[[Brotherhood and unity]]", but tensions between ethnicities began to escalate with the so-called [[Croatian Spring]] of 1970–71, a movement for greater [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|Croatia]]n autonomy, which was suppressed. In 1974 there followed constitutional changes, and the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]] devolved some of the federal powers to the constituent republics and provinces. After Tito's death in 1980 ethnic tensions grew, first in Albanian-majority [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|SAP Kosovo]] with the [[1981 protests in Kosovo]]. In the late 1980s [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]]n leader [[Slobodan Milošević]] used the Kosovo crisis to stoke up Serb nationalism and attempt to consolidate and dominate the country, which alienated the other ethnic groups.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

Parallel to the same process, [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|SR Slovenia]] witnessed a policy of gradual liberalization since 1984, somewhat similar to the Soviet Perestroika. This provoked tensions between the [[League of Communists of Slovenia]] on one side, and the central Yugoslav Party and the [[Yugoslav People's Army|federal army]] on the other side. By the late 1980s, many civil society groups were pushing towards democratization, while widening the space for cultural plurality. In 1987 and 1988, a series of clashes between the emerging civil society and the Communist regime culminated with the so-called [[Slovene Spring]], a mass movement for democratic reforms. The [[Committee for the Defence of Human Rights]] was established as the platform of all major non-Communist political movements. By early 1989, several anti-Communist political parties were already openly functioning, challenging the hegemony of the Slovenian Communists. Soon, the Slovenian Communists, pressured by their own civil society, came into conflict with the Serbian Communist leadership.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

In January 1990, an extraordinary Congress of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] was called in order to settle the disputes among its constituent parties. Faced with being completely outnumbered, the Slovenian and Croatian Communists walked out of the Congress on 23 January 1990, thus effectively bringing to an end the Yugoslav Communist Party. Both parties of the two western republics negotiated free multi-party elections with their own opposition movements.

On 8 April 1990, the democratic and anti-Yugoslav [[DEMOS coalition]] won the [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 1990|elections in Slovenia]], while on 24 April 1990 the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|Croatian elections]] witnessed the landslide victory of the nationalist [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) led by [[Franjo Tuđman]]. The results were much more balanced in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina parliamentary election, 1990|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Macedonian parliamentary election, 1990|Macedonia]] in November 1990, while the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 1990|parliamentary]] and [[Serbian presidential election, 1990|presidential]] elections of December 1990 in Serbia and [[Montenegrin parliamentary election, 1990|Montenegro]] consolidated the power of Milošević and his supporters. Free elections on the level of the federation were never carried out.

The Slovenian and Croatian leaderships started preparing plans for secession from the federation, while the [[Serbs of Croatia]] organized the so-called [[Log Revolution]], an insurrection that would lead to the creation of the breakaway region of [[SAO Krajina]]. In the [[Slovenian independence referendum, 1990|Slovenian independence referendum]] on 23 December 1990, 88.5% of residents voted for independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sei/documents/slovenian3.pdf |publisher=Sussex |place=UK |format=PDF |title=Slovenian Referendum Briefing No. 3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218000730/http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sei/documents/slovenian3.pdf |archivedate=18 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Croatian independence referendum, 1991|Croatian independence referendum]] on 2 May 1991, 93.24% voted for independence.

The escalating ethnic and national tensions were exacerbated by the drive for independence and led to the following [[Yugoslav wars]]:
* [[Ten-Day War|War in Slovenia]] (1991)
* [[Croatian War of Independence]] (1991–1995)
* [[Bosnian War]] (1992–1995)
* [[Kosovo War]] (1998–1999), including the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]].

In addition, the [[insurgency in the Preševo Valley]] (1999–2001) and the [[insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia]] (2001) are also often discussed in the same context.{{Sfn | Judah |  2011}}{{Sfn | Naimark | Case | 2003 | p = xvii}}{{Sfn | Rogel | 2004 | pp = 91–92}}

=== Albania ===

In the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]], [[Enver Hoxha]], who led Albania for four decades, died on 11 April 1985. His successor, [[Ramiz Alia]], began to gradually open up the regime from above. In 1989, the first revolts started in [[Shkodra]] and spread in other cities. Eventually, the existing regime introduced some liberalization, including measures in 1990 providing for freedom to travel abroad. Efforts were begun to improve ties with the outside world. March 1991 elections—the first free elections in Albania since 1923, and only the third free elections in the country's history—left the former Communists in power, but a general strike and urban opposition led to the formation of a coalition cabinet including non-Communists. Albania's former Communists were routed in elections held in March 1992, amid economic collapse and social unrest.

== Malta Summit ==
[[File:Bush and Gorbachev at the Malta summit in 1989.gif|thumb|[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and President [[George H. W. Bush]] on board the Soviet cruise ship ''Maxim Gorky'', [[Marsaxlokk Harbour]]]]
The [[Malta Summit]] consisted of a meeting between U.S. President George H. W. Bush and U.S.S.R. leader Mikhail Gorbachev, taking place between 2–3 December 1989, just a few weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall, a meeting which contributed to the end of the [[Cold War]]{{citation needed| date=December 2010}} partially as a result of the broader pro-democracy movement. It was their second meeting following a meeting that included then President Ronald Reagan, in New York in December 1988. News reports of the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=1989: Malta Summit Ends Cold War|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/3/newsid_4119000/4119950.stm|accessdate=23 February 2015| publisher =BBC | work = News|date=3 December 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to the Malta Summit as the most important since 1945, when British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Soviet premier Joseph Stalin and U.S. President Franklin D.

== Election chronology in Central/Eastern Europe and Central Asia ==
Between June 1989 and April 1991, every Communist or former Communist Central and Eastern European or Asian country—and in the case of the USSR and Yugoslavia every constituent republic—held competitive parliamentary elections for the first time in many decades. Some elections were only partly free, others fully democratic. The chronology below gives the details of these historic elections and the date is the first day of voting as several elections were split over several days for run-off contests:

== Dissolution of the Soviet Union ==
{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}
{{main|Dissolution of the Soviet Union}}
[[File:Image0 ST.jpg|thumb|Tanks in Moscow's [[Red Square]] during the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|1991 coup attempt]]]]
On 1 July 1991, the Warsaw Pact was officially dissolved at a meeting in Prague. At a summit later that same month, Gorbachev and Bush declared a US–Soviet strategic partnership, decisively marking the end of the Cold War. President Bush declared that US–Soviet cooperation during the 1990–1991 [[Gulf War]] had laid the groundwork for a partnership in resolving bilateral and world problems.

As the Soviet Union rapidly withdrew its forces from Central and Southeast Europe, the spillover from the 1989 upheavals began reverberating throughout the Soviet Union itself. Agitation for self-determination led to first Lithuania, and then Estonia, Latvia and Armenia declaring independence. However, the Soviet central government demanded the revocation of the declarations and threatened military action and economic sanctions. The government even went as far as controversially sending [[Red Army]] troops to the streets of the Lithuanian capital, [[Vilnius]], to [[January Events (Lithuania)|suppress the separatist movements]] in January 1991, causing the deaths of 14 people.

Disaffection in other Soviet republics, such as Georgia and Azerbaijan, was countered by promises of greater decentralization. More open elections led to the election of candidates opposed to Communist Party rule.

''Glasnost'' had inadvertently released the long-suppressed national sentiments of all peoples within the borders of the multinational Soviet state. These nationalist movements were further strengthened by the rapid deterioration of the Soviet economy, whose ramshackle foundations were exposed with the removal of Communist discipline. Gorbachev's reforms had failed to improve the economy, with the old Soviet [[planned economy|command structure]] completely breaking down. One by one, the constituent republics created their own economic systems and voted to subordinate Soviet laws to local laws. In 1990, the Communist Party was forced to surrender its seven-decade monopoly of political power when the Supreme Soviet rescinded the clause in the Soviet Constitution that guaranteed its sole authority to rule. Gorbachev's policies caused the Communist Party to lose its grip over the media. Details of the Soviet Union's past were quickly being declassified. This caused many to distrust the 'old system' and push for greater autonomy and independence.

After a referendum confirmed the preservation of the Soviet Union but in a looser form, a group of Soviet hard-liners represented by Vice-President [[Gennadi Yanayev]] launched [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|a coup attempting to overthrow Gorbachev]] in August 1991. [[Boris Yeltsin]], then president of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], rallied the people and much of the army against the coup and the effort collapsed. Although restored to power, Gorbachev's authority had been irreparably undermined. Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary of the Communist Party following the coup, and the Supreme Soviet dissolved the Party and banned all Communist activity on Soviet soil. Just a few weeks later, the government granted the Baltic states their independence on 6 September.

Over the next three months, one republic after another declared independence, mostly out of fear of another coup. Also during this time, the Soviet government was rendered useless as the new Russian government began taking over what remained of it, including the Kremlin. The penultimate step came on 1 December, when voters in the second most powerful republic, Ukraine, overwhelmingly voted to secede from the Soviet Union in a referendum. This ended any realistic chance of keeping the Soviet Union together. On 8 December, Yeltsin met with his counterparts from Ukraine and Belarus and signed the [[Belavezha Accords]], declaring that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. Gorbachev denounced this as illegal, but he had long since lost any ability to influence events outside of Moscow.

Two weeks later, 11 of the remaining 12 republics—all except Georgia—signed the [[Alma-Ata Protocol]], which confirmed the Soviet Union had been effectively dissolved and replaced by a new voluntary association, the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. Bowing to the inevitable, Gorbachev resigned as Soviet president on 25 December, and the Supreme Soviet ratified the Belavezha Accords the next day, legally dissolving itself and the Soviet Union as a political entity. By the end of 1991, the few Soviet institutions that hadn't been taken over by Russia had dissolved. The Soviet Union was officially disbanded, breaking up into fifteen constituent parts, thereby ending the world's largest and most influential Socialist state, and leaving to China that position. A [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]] dissolved into violence in Moscow as the [[Russian Army]] was called in to reestablish order.

=== Baltic states ===
{{main|Singing Revolution}}
[[File:1989 08 23 Baltijoskelias14.jpg|thumb|[[Baltic Way]] was a [[human chain]] of approximately two million people dedicated to liberating the [[Baltic Republics]] from the [[Soviet Union]].]]
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania implemented democratic reforms and achieved independence from the Soviet Union.

The Singing Revolution is a commonly used name for events between 1987 and 1991 that led to the restoration of the independence of [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonia]], [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvia]] and [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Thomson | first=Clare | title=The Singing Revolution: A Political Journey through the Baltic States | location= London  | publisher= Joseph | year= 1992 | isbn= 0-7181-3459-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Ginkel | first=John |date=September 2002 | title=Identity Construction in Latvia's "Singing Revolution": Why inter-ethnic conflict failed to occur | journal=Nationalities Papers | volume=30| issue=3| pages=403–33 | doi = 10.1080/0090599022000011697}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by an Estonian activist and artist, [[Heinz Valk]], in an article published a week after the 10–11 June 1988 spontaneous mass night-singing demonstrations at the [[Tallinn Song Festival Grounds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nI73PdnqQlcC&amp;pg | title = Between Utopia and Disillusionment | first = Henri | last = Vogt | p = 26 | ISBN = 1-57181-895-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Estonia [[Estonian Sovereignty Declaration|declared its sovereignty]] from the Soviet Union on 16 November 1988. Lithuania followed on 18 May 1989 and Latvia on 28 July 1989. [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania|Lithuania declared full independence]] on 11 March 1990 and on 30 March, Estonia announced the start of a transitional period to independence, [[On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia|followed by Latvia]] on 4 May. These declarations were met with force from the Soviet Union in early 1991, in confrontations known as the [[January Events (Lithuania)|"January Events" in Lithuania]] and "[[The Barricades]]" in Latvia. The Baltic states contended that their incorporation into the Soviet Union had been illegal under both international law and their own law, and they were reasserting an independence that still legally existed.

Soon after the launching of the August coup, Estonia and Latvia declared full independence. By the time the coup was foiled, the USSR was no longer unified enough to mount a forceful resistance, and it recognized the independence of the Baltic states on 6 September.

=== Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova ===
* {{flag|Belarus|1991}} declared full independence from the USSR on August 25, 1991. The main political changes of the early 1990s were driven by the [[Belarusian Popular Front]] and its fraction in the [[Supreme Soviet of Belarus]]. A few years later, a new postcommunist leader, [[Alexander Lukashenko]], has obtained power. After a short period he increased his power as a result of two controversial referenda (1995–96) and has been criticized for [[Human rights in Belarus|repressing political opposition]] ever since.
* {{flag|Moldova}} participated in the [[War of Transnistria]] between Moldova and Russian-connected forces. Communists came back to power in a 2001 election under [[Vladimir Voronin]], but faced [[2009 Moldova civil unrest|civil unrest]] in 2009 over accusations of rigged elections.
* {{flag|Ukraine}} [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|declared its independence]] in August 1991. Presidencies of former Communists [[Leonid Kravchuk]] and [[Leonid Kuchma]] were followed by the [[Orange Revolution]] in 2004, in which Ukrainians elected [[Viktor Yushchenko]] (also former member of [[CPSU]]).

=== Transcaucasia ===
[[File:April9victims.jpg|thumb|Photos of 9 April 1989 victims of the [[Tbilisi massacre]] on a billboard in [[Tbilisi]]]]
* {{flag|Georgia|1990}} and the [[North Caucasus]] have been marred by ethnic and sectarian violence since the collapse of the USSR. In April 1989 the [[Soviet Army]] [[April 9 tragedy|massacred]] demonstrators in [[Tbilisi]]. By November 1989, the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian SSR]] officially condemned the Russian invasion in 1921. Democracy activist [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] served as president from 1991 to 1992. Russia aided break-away republics in wars in [[1991-1992 South Ossetia War|South Ossetia]] and [[War in Abkhazia (1992-1993)|Abkhazia]] during the early 1990s, conflicts that have periodically reemerged, and Russia has accused Georgia of supporting Chechen rebels during the [[First Chechen War|Chechen wars]]. A coup d'état installed former Communist leader [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] as President of Georgia until the [[Rose Revolution]] in 2003.
* {{flag|Armenia}}'s independence struggle included violence as the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] was fought between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Armenia became increasingly militarized (with the ascendancy of Kocharian, a former president of Nagorno-Karabakh, often viewed as a milestone), while elections have since been increasingly controversial, and government corruption became more rife. After Kocharyan, notably, [[Serzh Sargsyan]] ascended to power. Sargsyan is often noted as the "founder of the Armenian and Karabakh militaries" and was, in the past, defense minister and national security minister.
* {{flag|Azerbaijan}}'s [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party|Popular Front Party]] won first elections with the self-described pro-Western, populist nationalist Elchibey. However, Elchibey planned to end Moscow's advantage in the harvesting of Azeri oil and build much stronger links with Turkey and Europe, and as a result was overthrown by former Communists in a coup backed by Russia and Iran (which viewed the new country as a compelling threat, with territorial ambitions within Iranian borders and also being a strong economic rival).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=Glenn E.|title=Azerbaijan: A Country Study|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutallibov rose to power, but he was soon destabilized and eventually ousted due to popular frustration with his perceived incompetence, corruption and improper handling of the war with Armenia. Azerbaijani KGB and Azerbaijani SSR leader [[Heydar Aliyev]] captured power and remained president until he transferred the presidency to his son in 2003. The [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] was fought between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and has largely defined the fates of both countries. However, unlike Armenia, which remains a strong Russian ally, Azerbaijan has begun, since Russia's 2008 war with Georgia, to foster better relations with Turkey and other Western nations, while lessening ties with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nagorno-Karabakh profile|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18270325|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chechnya ===
[[File:Evstafiev-chechnya-women-pray.jpg|thumb|[[Chechen people|Chechen]] women praying in [[Grozny]], December 1994]]
In [[Chechnya]], using tactics partly copied from the Baltics, anti-Communist coalition forces led by former Soviet general [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]] staged a largely bloodless revolution, and ended up forcing the resignation of the Communist republican president. Dudayev was elected in a landslide in the following election and in November 1991 he proclaimed [[Checheno-Ingushetia]]'s independence as the Republic of Ichkeria. Ingushetia voted to leave the union with Chechnya, and was allowed to do so (thus it became the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria). Due to his desire to exclude Moscow from all oil deals, Yeltsin backed a failed coup against him in 1993. In 1994, Chechnya, with only marginal recognition (one country: Georgia, which was revoked soon after the coup landing Shevardnadze in power), was invaded by Russia, spurring the [[First Chechen War]]. The Chechens, with considerable assistance from the populations of both former-Soviet countries and from Sunni Muslim countries repelled this invasion and a peace treaty was signed in 1997. However, Chechnya became increasingly anarchic, largely due to the both political and physical destruction of the state during the invasion, and general Shamil Basaev, having evaded all control by the central government, conducted raids into neighboring Dagestan, which Russia used as pretext for reinvading Ichkeria. Ichkeria was then reincorporated into Russia as Chechnya again, though insurgency continues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rbc.ru/politics/12/05/2017/5915d8799a794757ef77f42e&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Central Asia ===
* {{flag|Kazakhstan|1991}}'s independence struggle began with the [[Jeltoqsan]] uprising in 1986. Former Communist leader [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] has been in power since 1990 when he started serving as [[Kazakh SSR|President of Kazakh SSR]].
* {{flag|Kyrgyzstan|1991}}'s [[Askar Akayev]] retained power until the [[Tulip Revolution]] in 2005.
* {{flag|Tajikistan|1991}}'s [[Rahmon Nabiyev]] retained power, which led to the [[civil war in Tajikistan]]. [[Emomalii Rahmon]] has succeeded Nabiyev and has retained power since 1992.
* {{flag|Turkmenistan|1991}}'s [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] retained power until his death in 2006 and was criticized as one of the world's most totalitarian and repressive leaders, maintaining his own [[cult of personality]].
* {{flag|Uzbekistan}}'s [[Islam Karimov]] retained power until his death in 2016, and was widely criticized for repressing the political opposition throughout his tenure.

=== Post-Soviet conflicts ===
Russia was involved in a number of conflicts, including the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], the [[War of Transnistria]], the [[1991–1992 South Ossetia War]], the [[First Chechen War]], the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–1993)|War in Abkhazia]], the [[Ossetian–Ingush conflict]], and the [[2014 Crimean Crisis|Crimea]] and [[War in Donbass|Donbass]] conflicts in Ukraine.

== Political reforms ==
{{main|Decommunization}}
Decommunization is a process of overcoming the legacies of the [[Communist state]] establishments, culture, and psychology in the post-Communist states.

Decommunization was largely limited or non-existent. Communist parties were not outlawed and their members were not brought to trial. Just a few places even attempted to exclude members of communist secret services from decision-making. In a number of countries the Communist party simply changed its name and continued to function.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icer.it/docs/wp2000/Pejovich162000.pdf After Socialism: where hope for individual liberty lies]. Svetozar Pejovich.&lt;/ref&gt;

In several European countries, however, endorsing or attempting to justify crimes committed by Nazi or Communist regimes will be punishable by up to 3 years of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annefrank.org/content.asp?PID=888&amp;LID=2|title=This page does not / no longer exist|author=Anne Frank Stichting|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic reforms ==
State run enterprises in socialist countries had little or no interest in producing what customers wanted which resulted in shortages of goods and services.&lt;ref name="aslund"/&gt; In the early 1990s, the general view was that there was no precedent for moving from socialism to capitalism",&lt;ref name="Havrylyshyn"/&gt; and only some elderly people remembered how a market economy worked. As result the view that Central, Southeastern and Eastern Europe would stay poor for decades was common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=The world after 1989: Walls in the mind |work=The Economist | date=5 November 2009 | url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=14793753 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a temporary fall of output in the official economy and an increase in black market economic activity.&lt;ref name="aslund"/&gt;
Countries implemented different reform programs. One example, generally regarded as successful was the "shock therapy" [[Balcerowicz Plan]] in Poland. Eventually the official economy began to grow.&lt;ref name="aslund"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Myth of Output Collapse after Communism | author=Anders Aslund | date=1 December 2000 | url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=611 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 paper, Oleh Havrylyshyn categorized the speed of reforms in the Soviet Bloc:&lt;ref name="Havrylyshyn"&gt;{{cite web | title=Fifteen Years of Transformation in the Post-Communist World | author=Oleh Havrylyshyn | date=9 November 2007 | url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/dpa/DPA4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2004 enlargement of the European Union]] included the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia.

The same countries have also [[Enlargement of NATO|become NATO members]]. In Mongolia, however, its economy was reformed in a similar fashion to the Eastern European counterparts.

[[Chinese economic reform|Chinese economic liberalization]] started since 1978 have helped lift millions of people out of poverty, bringing the poverty rate down from 53% of the population in the Mao era to 12% in 1981. Deng's economic reforms are still being followed by the [[Communist Party of China|CPC]] today and by 2001 the poverty rate became only 6% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/0,,contentMDK:20634060~pagePK:64165401~piPK:64165026~theSitePK:469382,00.html Fighting Poverty: Findings and Lessons from China’s Success] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922130002/http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/0,,contentMDK:20634060~pagePK:64165401~piPK:64165026~theSitePK:469382,00.html |date=22 September 2013 }} (World Bank).

[[Doi Moi|Economic liberalization in Vietnam]] was initiated in 1986, following the Chinese example.

Harvard University Professor [[Richard B. Freeman]] has called the effect of reforms "The Great Doubling". He calculated that the size of the global workforce doubled from 1.46&amp;nbsp;billion workers to 2.93&amp;nbsp;billion workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emlab.berkeley.edu/users/webfac/eichengreen/e183_sp07/great_doub.pdf |title=The Great Doubling: The Challenge of the New Global Labor Market |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/focus/pdfs/foc261a.pdf | title=The new global labor market | author=Richard Freeman | publisher=University of Wisconsin–Madison Institute for Research on Poverty | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; An immediate effect was a reduced ratio of capital to labor. In the long, term China, India, and the former Soviet bloc will save and invest and contribute to the expansion of the world capital stock.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;

In 1992, President Yeltsin's government invited [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] to serve as an expert to testify at the [[CPSU]] trial by [[Constitutional Court]] of Russia, where the Communists were suing Yeltsin for banning their party. The respondent's case was that the [[CPSU]] itself had been an unconstitutional organization. To prepare for his testimony, Bukovsky requested and was granted access to a large number of documents from Soviet archives (then reorganized into [[TsKhSD]]). Using a small handheld scanner and a laptop computer, he managed to secretly scan many documents (some with high [[security clearance]]), including [[KGB]] reports to the [[Central Committee]], and smuggle the files to the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = JHU | contribution-url = http://psi.ece.jhu.edu/~kaplan/IRUSS/BUK/GBARC/buk.html | contribution = Soviet Archives | title = Info-Russ}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The event that many expected would be another [[Nuremberg Trial]] and the beginnings of reconciliation with the Communist past, ended up in half-measures: while the CPSU was found unconstitutional, the Communists were allowed to form new parties in the future. Bukovsky expressed his deep disappointment with this in his writings and interviews: "Having failed to finish off conclusively the Communist system, we are now in danger of integrating the resulting monster into our world. It may not be called Communism anymore, but it retained many of its dangerous characteristics... Until the Nuremberg-style tribunal passes its judgment on all the crimes committed by Communism, it is not dead and the war is not over."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.frontpagemag.com./Articles/Printable.asp?ID=1589 | title = The Cold War and the War Against Terror | first = Jamie | last = Glazov | newspaper = Front Page | date = 1 July 2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations ==
The events caught many by surprise. [[Predictions of Soviet collapse|Predictions of the Soviet Union's impending demise]] had been often dismissed.&lt;ref name="melt"&gt;{{cite news|first=Ian|last=Cummins|title=The Great MeltDown|work=The Australian|date=23 December 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bartlomiej Kaminski's book ''The Collapse of State Socialism'' argued that the state Socialist system has a lethal paradox, saying that "policy actions designed to improve performance only accelerate its decay".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/47325/robert-legvold/the-collapse-of-state-socialism | title = The Collapse of State Socialism | newspaper = Foreign Affairs}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1989, revolts had spread from one capital to another, ousting the regimes imposed on Central, South-East and Eastern Europe after World War II. Even the isolationist Stalinist regime in Albania was unable to stem the tide. Gorbachev's abrogation of the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]] was perhaps the key factor that enabled the popular uprisings to succeed. Once it became evident that the feared Soviet Army would not intervene to crush dissent, the Central, South-East and Eastern European regimes were exposed as vulnerable in the face of popular uprisings against the one-party system and power of [[secret police]].

[[Coit D. Blacker]] wrote in 1990 that the Soviet leadership "appeared to have believed that whatever loss of authority the Soviet Union might suffer in Central and South-East Europe would be more than offset by a net increase in its influence in western Europe."&lt;ref name="fa90"&gt;{{Citation | first = Coit D | last = Blacker | title = The Collapse of Soviet Power in Europe | journal = Foreign Affairs | year = 1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it is unlikely that Gorbachev ever intended for the complete dismantling of Communism and the Warsaw Pact. Rather, Gorbachev assumed that the Communist parties of Central and South-East Europe could be reformed in a similar way to the reforms he hoped to achieve in the CPSU. Just as ''perestroika'' was aimed at making the Soviet Union more efficient economically and politically, Gorbachev believed that the [[Comecon]] and Warsaw Pact could be reformed into more effective entities. However, [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]], a close advisor to Gorbachev, would later state that it would have been "absurd to keep the system" in Central and South-East Europe. Yakovlev had come to the conclusion that the Soviet-dominated Comecon could not work on non-market principles and that the Warsaw Pact had "no relevance to real life."&lt;ref name="Steele"&gt;{{Citation | last = Steele | first = Jonathan | title = Eternal Russia: Yeltsin, Gorbachev and the Mirage of Democracy | place = Boston | publisher = Faber | year = 1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SWOT en.svg|thumb|A SWOT analysis, with its four elements in a 2×2 matrix.]]
'''SWOT analysis''' (or '''SWOT matrix''') is a strategic planning technique used to help a person or organization identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to  [[business]] competition or project planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SWOT Analysis: Discover New Opportunities, Manage and Eliminate Threats|url=http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_05.htm|accessdate=24 February 2018|language=en|date=1006|website=www.mindtools.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to specify the objectives of the business venture or project and identify the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieving those objectives. Users of a SWOT analysis often ask and answer questions to generate meaningful information for each category to make the tool useful and identify their competitive advantage. SWOT has been described as the tried-and-true tool of strategic analysis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management|last=Dess|first=Gregory|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2018|isbn=9781259927621|location=United States|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Strengths and weakness are frequently internally-related, while opportunities and threats commonly focus on the external environment. The name is an acronym for the four parameters the technique examines:
* '''''S'''trengths'': characteristics of the business or project that give it an advantage over others.
* '''''W'''eaknesses'': characteristics of the business that place the business or project at a disadvantage relative to others.
* '''''O'''pportunities'': elements in the environment that the business or project could exploit to its advantage.
* '''''T'''hreats'':  elements in the environment that could cause trouble for the business or project.
The degree to which the internal environment of the firm matches with the external environment is expressed by the concept of [[strategic fit]]. Identification of SWOTs is important because they can inform later steps in planning to achieve the objective. First, decision-makers should consider whether the objective is attainable, given the SWOTs. If the objective is ''not'' attainable, they must select a different objective and repeat the process.

Some authors credit SWOT to [[Albert S. Humphrey|Albert Humphrey]], who led a convention at the Stanford Research Institute (now [[SRI International]]) in the 1960s and 1970s using data from [[Fortune 500]] companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sri.com/sites/default/files/brochures/dec-05.pdf|title=SWOT Analysis for Management Consulting|last=Humphrey|first=Albert|date=December 2005|work=SRI Alumni Newsletter|publisher=[[SRI International]]|authorlink=Albert S. Humphrey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamplc.com/Humphsprofile.htm|title=Albert Humphrey The "Father" of TAM|publisher=TAM UK|accessdate=2012-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Humphrey himself did not claim the creation of SWOT, and the origins remain obscure.

== Internal and external factors ==
SWOT analysis aims to identify the key internal and external factors seen as important to achieving an objective. SWOT analysis groups key pieces of information into two main categories:

# Internal factors — the ''strengths'' and ''weaknesses'' internal to the organization
# External factors — the ''opportunities'' and ''threats'' presented by the environment external to the organization

Analysis may view the internal factors as strengths or as weaknesses depending upon their effect on the organization's objectives.  What may represent strengths with respect to one objective may be weaknesses (distractions, competition) for another objective.  The factors may include all of the [[marketing mix|4Ps]] as well as [[personnel]], [[finance]], [[manufacturing]] capabilities, and so on.

The external factors may include [[macroeconomic]] matters, [[technological change]], [[legislation]], and sociocultural changes, as well as changes in the marketplace or in competitive position.  The results are often presented in the form of a [[Table (information)|matrix]].

SWOT analysis is just one method of [[categorization]] and has its own weaknesses. For example, it may tend to persuade its users to compile lists rather than to think about actual important factors in achieving objectives. It also presents the resulting lists uncritically and without clear prioritization so that, for example, weak opportunities may appear to balance strong threats.

It is prudent not to eliminate any candidate SWOT entry too quickly. The importance of individual SWOTs will be revealed by the value of the strategies they generate.  A SWOT item that produces valuable strategies is important.  A SWOT item that generates no strategies is not important.

== Use ==
The usefulness of SWOT analysis is not limited to [[For-profit corporation|profit-seeking organizations]].  SWOT analysis may be used in any decision-making situation when a desired end-state (objective) is defined.  Examples include [[non-profit organizations]], governmental units, and individuals. SWOT analysis may also be used in pre-crisis planning and preventive [[crisis management]]. SWOT analysis may also be used in creating a recommendation during a [[viability study]]/survey.

=== Strategy building ===
SWOT analysis can be used effectively to build organizational or personal strategy.  Steps necessary to execute strategy-oriented analysis involve identification of internal and external factors (using the popular 2x2 matrix), selection and evaluation of the most important factors, and identification of relations existing between internal and external features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Blake |first1=Martin |last2=Wijetilaka |first2=Shehan |date=26 February 2015 |title=5 tips to grow your start-up using SWOT analysis |url=http://www.brw.com.au/p/entrepreneurs/tips_to_grow_your_start_up_using_eQEF8Pm8l2Q9hME9TBXvVL |location=Sydney |access-date=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, strong relations between strengths and opportunities can suggest good conditions in the company and allow using an ''aggressive'' strategy. On the other hand, strong interactions between weaknesses and threats could be analyzed as a potential warning and advice for using a ''defensive'' strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Osita |first=Christian |last2=Onyebuchi |first2=Idoko |last3=Justina |first3=Nzekwe |date=31 January 2014 |title=Organization's stability and productivity: the role of SWOT analysis |url=http://journalijiar.com/uploads/2014-10-02_231409_710.pdf |publisher=International Journal of Innovative and Applied Research (2014) |volume=2 |issue=9 |pages=23–32 |access-date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Matching and converting ===
One way of using SWOT is matching and converting. Matching is used to find [[competitive advantage]] by matching the strengths to opportunities. Another tactic is to convert weaknesses or threats into strengths or opportunities. An example of a conversion strategy is to find new markets. If the threats or weaknesses cannot be converted, a company should try to minimize or avoid them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shsu.edu/~mkt_ssm/mkt570/Chap04.ppt See for instance: Mehta, S. (2000) ''Marketing Strategy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corporate planning ===
As part of the development of strategies and plans to enable the organization to achieve its objectives, that organization will use a systematic/rigorous process known as [[corporate planning]]. SWOT alongside [[PEST analysis|PEST]]/[[PESTLE]] can be used as a basis for the analysis of business and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong. M. A handbook of Human Resource Management Practice (10th edition) 2006, Kogan Page, London {{ISBN|0-7494-4631-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Set objectives — defining what the organization is going to do
* Environmental scanning
** Internal appraisals of the organization's SWOT — this needs to include an assessment of the present situation as well as a portfolio of products/services and an analysis of the product/service lifecycle
* Analysis of existing strategies — this should determine relevance from the results of an internal/external appraisal. This may include [[gap analysis]] of environmental factors
* Strategic Issues defined — key factors in the development of a corporate plan that the organization must address
* Develop new/revised strategies — revised analysis of strategic issues may mean the objectives need to change
* Establish [[critical success factor]]s — the achievement of objectives and strategy implementation
* Preparation of operational, resource, projects plans for strategy implementation
* Monitoring all results — mapping against plans, taking corrective action, which may mean amending objectives/strategies&lt;ref name=arms&gt;Armstrong.M  Management Processes and Functions, 1996, London CIPD  {{ISBN|0-85292-438-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marketing ===
{{Main|Marketing management}}
In many competitor analysis, marketers build detailed profiles of each competitor in the market, focusing especially on their relative competitive strengths and weaknesses using SWOT analysis. Marketing managers will examine each competitor's cost structure, sources of profits, resources and competencies, competitive positioning and product differentiation, degree of [[vertical integration]], historical responses to industry developments, and other factors.

Marketing management often finds it necessary to invest in research to collect the data required to perform accurate marketing analysis. Accordingly, management often conducts market research (alternately marketing research) to obtain this information. Marketers employ a variety of techniques to conduct market research, but some of the more common include:
* Qualitative marketing research such as focus groups
* Quantitative marketing research such as statistical surveys
* Experimental techniques such as test markets
* Observational techniques such as ethnographic (on-site) observation
* Marketing managers may also design and oversee various environmental scanning and competitive intelligence processes to help identify trends and inform the company's marketing analysis.

| Expertise at partner level in HRM consultancy
| Unable to deal with multidisciplinary assignments because of size or lack of ability
| Identified market for consultancy in areas other than HRM
| Other small consultancies looking to invade the marketplace
|- valign=top

== In community organization ==
The SWOT analysis has been used in community work as a tool to identify positive and negative factors within organizations, communities, and the broader society that promote or inhibit successful implementation of social services and social change efforts.&lt;ref name="community tool box"&gt;{{cite web |title=Community Toolbox: Section 14. SWOT analysis |url=http://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/assessment/assessing-community-needs-and-resources/swot-analysis/main |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used as a preliminary resource, assessing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in a community served by a nonprofit or community organization.&lt;ref name="social work" /&gt; This organizing tool is best used in collaboration with community workers and/or community members before developing goals and objectives for a program design or implementing an organizing strategy. The SWOT analysis is a part of the planning for social change process and will not provide a strategic plan if used by itself.  After a SWOT analysis is completed, a social change organization can turn the SWOT list into a series of recommendations to consider before developing a strategic plan.&lt;ref name="our community"&gt;{{cite web |title=Our Community |url=https://www.ourcommunity.com.au/boards/boards_article.jsp?articleId=1369 |accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Demographics — changes in the age, race, gender, culture of those you serve or in your area

* Legislation — do new federal requirements make your job harder...or easier?
* Local, national, or international events

Although the SWOT analysis was originally designed as an organizational method for business and industries, it has been replicated in various community work as a tool for identifying external and internal support to combat internal and external opposition.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt; The SWOT analysis is necessary to provide direction to the next stages of the change process.&lt;ref name=BOOK&gt;{{cite book |last=Birkenmaier |first=Julie |title=The Practice of Generalist Social Work |year=2001 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used by community organizers and community members to further social justice in the context of Social Work practice.

=== Application in community organization ===

As mentioned [[SWOT analysis#top|above]], SWOT can be crucial to determining the success of a project, while factoring in funding, as well as accessibility and logic. Often, a city will spend a year weighing the [[Risk-benefit]]s&lt;ref&gt;[[Pittsburg, California]] tried this out recently with the BART program. Citation: (Document). Pittsburg City, California, www.ci.pittsburg.ca.us/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Urban Analysis of Urmia, Iran |url=http://rrrs.reviste.ubbcluj.ro/arhive/Artpdf/v10n22014/RRRS10220145.pdf |website=Reviste}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a project before they even vote on it.
==== Elements to consider ====
Elements to consider in a SWOT analysis include understanding the community that a particular organization is working with. This can be done via public forums, listening campaigns, and informational interviews. Data collection will help inform the community members and workers when developing the SWOT analysis. A needs and assets assessment is tooling that can be used to identify the needs and existing resources of the community. When these assessments are done and data has been collected, an analysis of the community can be made that informs the SWOT analysis.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;

==== Steps for implementation ====
A SWOT analysis is best developed in a group setting such as a work or community meeting. A facilitator can conduct the meeting by first explaining what a SWOT analysis is as well as identifying the meaning of each term.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;

One way of facilitating the development of a SWOT analysis includes developing an example SWOT with the larger group then separating each group into smaller teams to present to the larger group after set amount of time.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt; This allows for individuals, who may be silenced in a larger group setting, to contribute. Once the allotted time is up, the facilitator may record all the factors of each group onto a large document such as a poster board, and then the large group,  as a collective, can go work through each of the threats and weaknesses to explore options that may be used to combat negative forces with the strengths and opportunities present within the organization and community.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt; A SWOT meeting allows  participants to creatively brainstorm, identify obstacles, and possibly strategize solutions/way forward to these limitations.

==== When to use SWOT analysis ====
The uses of a SWOT analysis by a community organization are as follows: to   organize information, provide insight into barriers&lt;ref name="use and misuse"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chermack |first=Thomas J. |author2=Bernadette K. Kasshanna |title=The Use of and Misuse of SWOT analysis and implications for HRD professionals |journal=Human Resource Development International |date=December 2007 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=383–399}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that may be present while engaging in social change processes, and identify strengths available that can be activated to counteract these barriers.

''A SWOT analysis can be used to:''
* Explore new solutions to problems &lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* Identify barriers that will limit goals/objectives &lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* Decide on direction that will be most effective &lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* Reveal possibilities and limitations for change&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* To revise plans to best navigate systems, communities, and organizations
* As a brainstorming and recording device as a means of communication&lt;ref name="use and misuse" /&gt;
* To enhance "credibility of interpretation" to be used in presentation to leaders or key supporters.&lt;ref name="social work"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Westhues |first=Anne |author2=Jean Lafrance |author3=Glen Schmidt |title=A SWOT analysis of social work education in Canada |journal=Social Work Education: The International Journal |year=2001 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=35–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits and advantages ===
The SWOT analysis in social work practice framework is beneficial because it helps organizations decide whether or not an objective is obtainable and therefore enables organizations to set achievable goals, objectives, and steps to further the social change or community development effort.&lt;ref name=benefits&gt;{{cite web |last=Quincy |first=Ronald |title=SWOT Analysis: Raising capacity of your organization |url=http://socialwork.rutgers.edu/Libraries/Huamin/Brochure_2.sflb |publisher=Rutgers School of Social Work |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417010302/http://socialwork.rutgers.edu/libraries/huamin/brochure_2.sflb |archivedate=2016-04-17 |accessdate=2013-02-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It enables organizers to take visions and produce practical and efficient outcomes that effect long-lasting change, and it helps organizations gather meaningful information to maximize their potential.&lt;ref name="benefits" /&gt; Completing a SWOT analysis is a useful process regarding the consideration of key organizational priorities, such as gender and cultural diversity and fundraising objectives.&lt;ref name="change agency"&gt;{{cite web |title=Campaigners Toolkit: Strategy |publisher=The Change Agency |url=http://www.thechangeagency.org/campaigners-toolkit/training-resources/strategy/ |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
Some findings from Menon et al. (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Menon, A. |title=Antecedents and Consequences of Marketing Strategy Making |journal=Journal of Marketing |volume=63 |pages=18–40 |year=1999 |doi=10.2307/1251943 |jstor=1251943 |issue=2 |publisher=American Marketing Association |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hill and Westbrook (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hill, T. &amp; R. Westbrook |title=SWOT Analysis: It’s Time for a Product Recall |journal=Long Range Planning |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=46–52 |year=1997 |doi=10.1016/S0024-6301(96)00095-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that SWOT may harm performance and that "no-one subsequently used the outputs within the later stages of the strategy". 

Other critiques include the misuse of the SWOT analysis as a technique that can be quickly designed without critical thought leading to a misrepresentation of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats within an organization's internal and external surroundings.&lt;ref name="SWOT does not need to be recalled"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koch |first=Adam |title=SWOT does not need to be recalled: It needs to be enhanced |journal=Swineburne University of Technology |year=2000 |url=http://www.westga.edu/~bquest/2000/swot1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a firm becomes preoccupied with a single strength, such as cost control, they can neglect their weaknesses, such as product quality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another limitation includes the development of a SWOT analysis simply to defend previously decided goals and objectives. This misuse leads to limitations on brainstorming possibilities and "real" identification of barriers. This misuse also places the organization’s interest above the well-being of the community. Further, a SWOT analysis should be developed as a collaborative with a variety of contributions made by participants including community members. The design of a SWOT analysis by one or two community workers is limiting to the realities of the forces, specifically external factors, and devalues the possible contributions of community members.&lt;ref name="use and misuse" /&gt;

Overall, managers should remember that SWOT is a starting point for discussion and cannot, in itself, show managers how to achieve a competitive advantage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because the SWOT analysis is a snapshot of the firm at a particular moment in time, the analysis might obscure the fact that both the internal and external environment are rapidly changing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The SVOR alternative ==

In project management, the alternative to SWOT known by the acronym SVOR (Strengths, Vulnerabilities, Opportunities, and Risks) compares the project elements along two axes: internal and external, and positive and negative. It takes into account the mathematical link that exists between these various elements, considering also the role of infrastructures. The SVOR table provides an intricate understanding of the elements at play in a given project:&lt;ref&gt;Mesly, Olivier (2017). ''Project feasibility – Tools for uncovering points of vulnerability.'' New York, NY:Taylor and Francis, CRC Press, 546 pages,  9 {{ISBN|9781498757911}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Forces !! Internal !! Mathematical link !! External

|}
Constraints consist of: calendar of tasks and activities, costs, and norms of quality. The "''k''" constant varies with each project (for example, it may be valued at 1.3).{{cn|date=February 2018}}{{efn|Best source I could find is https://ceopedia.org/index.php/SWOT_analysis but seems unrelated.}}

== SWOT analysis in popular culture ==
=== Ads ===
Many reports have been published about the use of SWOT by real life companies, and how the idea is spreading.{{which|date=October 2018}} [[Coca-Cola (company)|Coca-Cola]] has used this in their television ads&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valueline.com/Stocks/Highlights/The_Coca-Cola_Company__A_Short_SWOT_Analysis.aspx#.Wo36ULeov4g|title=Value Line - The Most Trusted Name in Investment Research|publisher=Value Line Publishing|website=www.valueline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to effectively target a customer, such as appeal to senses.

=== Television shows ===
In the ''[[Silicon Valley (TV series)|Silicon Valley]]'' episode "Homicide" (Season 2, Episode 6), Jared Dunn ([[Zach Woods]]) introduces the Pied Piper team to SWOT analysis. Later in that episode Dinesh ([[Kumail Nanjiani]]) and Gilfoyle ([[Martin Starr]]) employ the method when deciding whether or not to inform a stunt driver that the calculations for his upcoming jump were performed incorrectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|url=https://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley/season-02/6-homicide/synopsis|website=HBO|title=Synopsis: ''Silicon Valley'' - 'Homicide'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Società Italiana Ernesto Breda''', more usually referred to simply as '''Breda''', was an [[Italy|Italian]] mechanical manufacturing company founded by Ernesto Breda in Milan in 1886. 

==History==
The firm was founded by Ernesto Breda in Milan in 1886. It originally manufactured [[locomotive]]s and other railway machinery, but later branched out into [[Weapon|armaments]] and [[aircraft]]. Occasionally, not continuously, the company also built [[Trolleybus|trolleybuses]].  In 1935, it acquired the railway division of [[Officine Ferroviarie Meridionali]] and, soon afterwards, the aircraft division of the same company.

In 1962, Breda was nationalised as part of EFIM, but was [[liquidated]] in the 1990s. The train and tram manufacturing division fused with [[Gio. Ansaldo &amp; C.|Ansaldo]] to form [[AnsaldoBreda]], the armaments division became an independent entity as [[Breda Meccanica Bresciana]], as did the research division as [[Istituto Scientifico Breda]].

===Trolleybuses===
The production of [[trolleybus]]es was a small part of Breda's output, carried out through its subsidiary ''Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie'' ([[:it:Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie|it]]), and was not under way continuously.  Between 1936 and 1940, the company built a total of 28 trolleybuses, most for the [[Trolleybuses in Rome|Rome system]] but including six for [[Trolleybuses in Genoa|Genoa]].&lt;ref name="murray"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Alan|title=World Trolleybus Encyclopaedia|year=2000|page=106|publisher=Trolleybooks|location=Yateley, Hampshire, UK|isbn=0-904235-18-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At various times between 1938 and 1956, more trolleybuses were built, but totalling only 16.  Production resumed in 1988.  Almost all of Breda's customers for trolleybuses were [[List of trolleybus systems in Italy|Italian trolleybus systems]], but a notable exception was an order of 236 [[dual-mode bus]]es that Breda built for the [[Trolleybuses in Seattle|Seattle system]] between 1988 and 1991.&lt;ref name="murray"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5764">'''Spiritual self-schema therapy''', sometimes referred to as '''3-S Therapy''', was developed at Yale University School of Medicine by S. Kelly Avants, Ph.D., and Arthur Margolin, Ph.D. It is a therapy for addicted individuals who have contracted [[HIV]] or are at risk for contracting [[HIV]], whose goals are to reduce illicit drug use as well as drug- and sex-related risk behaviors.  In general, it aims to promote living a spiritual life aiding in their recovery .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spiritual Self-Schema (3-S) development program for the treatment of addiction and HIV risk behavior|url=http://medicine.yale.edu/spiritualselfschema/training/manuals/therapy.aspx|publisher=Yale School of Medicine|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual self-schema therapy has a non-theistic foundation based on Buddhist practices, which are very similar to contemporary cognitive-behavioral techniques, and incorporates the client's spiritual beliefs, which do not need to be specifically or conventionally religious. &lt;ref name="3-S Theoretical Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|title=3-S Theoretical Foundation|url=http://www.3-s.us/about/foundation/index.aspx|publisher=Yale School of Medicine|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  3-S therapy does not "convert" clients to Buddhism or any other spiritual or religious belief system, but always works within the client's pre-existing set of beliefs. 

==Self-schema==
The term [[self-schema]] describes a mental process to aim in understanding and organizing incoming information (stimuli). An example would include looking in your rearview mirror while driving and seeing flashing lights - typically an individual has an automatic response and prepares to pull over with out having to think. This illustrates a well-organized schema on "flashing lights". The connection between self-schema and spiritual self-schema therapy is shown in the automatic beliefs about oneself. An individual doesn't have to stop and think "Who am I? How would somebody like that respond to this situation?" If an individual is shy and believes they are ugly, they may see somebody looking in their direction and assume the person is staring at how ugly they are, when in reality they could be finding the person quite attractive or even not looking at them at all.

==3-S at Yale==
[[Yale School of Medicine]] has started a program called 3-S Thearpy, signifying '''S'''piritual '''S'''elf-'''S'''chema. Self-schemas can be helpful, but they can also be problematic. Stereotypes are an example. Additionally, people who believe that they are "bad, worthless, or unlovable" do significant amounts of mental damage to themselves. Yale School of Medicine's 3-S program promotes [[spirituality]] as a strong resource for coping with life's troubles. The goal of its program is to create a path to enhance one's spiritual nature.&lt;ref name="3-S Theoretical Foundation" /&gt;  The therapy manuals for 3-S Therapy, in English, as well as translated into Spanish and Russian, are available at the Yale University website: https://medicine.yale.edu/spiritualselfschema/training/manuals/therapy.aspx

==HIV==
There is a growing trend in attempting to integrate spiritual and religious beliefs into [[HIV]] prevention and addiction treatment.

[[File:Bündner Schwabenkinder 1907.JPG|thumb|Swabian children from Graubünden at Arnach (1907)]]

The '''[[Swabia]]n children''' (German: ''Schwabenkinder'') were peasant children from poor families in the [[Alps]] of Austria and Switzerland who went to find work on farms in [[Upper Swabia]] and the [[Swabian Jura]]. Usually they were sent by their parents to become seasonal workers. They were taken in spring and brought to the child markets in Germany, mainly in [[Upper Swabia]], where they would be purchased or "rented" by farmers for the season. This use of children as workers was most widespread in the 19th century.

The march [[Principal passes of the Alps|over the Alps]] to Germany proved often difficult and exhausting. Usually their guide was a priest, who was also responsible for ensuring the children had a warm stable to sleep in.

The marches were large, organised groups of several thousand children, taken over the snow-covered mountains often still dressed in rags. It was not uncommon for five and six-year-old children to be taken.

The American press began a campaign in 1908 exposing the Swabian children, describing the child market in [[Friedrichshafen]] as a "barely concealed slave market".

The child markets were abolished in 1915, yet the trade of children did not end completely until compulsory schooling for foreign children was introduced in [[Württemberg]] in 1921.

Many immigration certificates from Swabia show surnames typical of [[county of Tyrol|Tyrol]] and other regions the children were taken from (e.g. ''Braxmeier'' from ''Braxmarer'').

==Film==

* ''Schwabenkinder'', TV film (first aired 2003), director: [[Jo Baier]], actors: [[Tobias Moretti]], [[Vadim Glowna]]

The movie is based on the novel "Die Schwabenkinder - Die Geschichte des Kaspanaze" (''"The Swabian Children - The Story of Kaspanaze"'') by [[Elmar Bereuter]] ({{ISBN|3-7766-2304-7}}).

'''Film synopsis:''' After his mother is killed in an avalanche, the farmer boy Kaspar is sent by his struggling father to work in Swabia. Together with other children from the village, their guide ([[Tobias Moretti]]) brings the group to the child market at [[Ravensburg]]. There the miraculous story begins: The brutal treatment of the boy by the farmer, his escape, emigration to the United States, and final home coming to his village many years later to visit his dying father.

Founded in 1988, the '''Swiss Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Singapore''' ('''SwissCham''') is a [[non-profit organization]] advocating [[Swiss]] business in [[Singapore]] through offering to its members a networking platform with a broad range of events as well as selective services and benefits. The SwissCham fosters business ties and friendship between Swiss and Singaporean companies, which are dating back for soon 200 years. Formerly known as the Swiss Business Association (“SBA”), it acts as the spokesperson of Swiss business interests in Singapore towards Singaporean and Swiss authorities as well as other chambers and business groups, cultivating the Swiss networking culture in Singapore and the region.
 
==History==
 
Being already present in Singapore for soon 200 years, Swiss companies intensified their activities and strengthened their presence in Singapore soon after it became a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] nation in 1965 and Switzerland decided to establish diplomatic relationships with the [[city-state]] in 1967. Swiss investments have been among the top five [[foreign direct investments]] (FDI) ever since, demonstrated by already more than 100 Swiss companies having had a presence in Singapore by the end of the 1980s. The need for an official forum to help these companies exchanging ideas and accessing information became increasingly important. In 1988, with the help of the Swiss Ambassador Kurt O. Wyss, the SBA was founded by a group of visionary Swiss-Singaporean businessmen and entrepreneurs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Swiss in Singapore|last=Zangger|first=Andreas|date=2013|publisher=Editions Didier Millet Pte Ltd|isbn=978-9-814-38568-8|location=Singapore|page=180|chapter=The pillars of the Swiss community (1970-2013)}}&lt;/ref&gt;. After representing and serving its members for over 25 years, the SBA committee conducted in 2015 a strategic review of its activities, vision and mission. With a transformation roadmap and revised statutes approved by the annual general meeting in 2016, the SBA got rebranded to the Swiss Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Singapore in 2017, underlining its continuous efforts to raise awareness on its work as a [[chamber of commerce]] and industry and staying relevant in a fast and constantly changing world. This sharpened focus of its activities included a variety of new initiatives such as a professionalized online presence and digital communication concept&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Swiss Chamber in Singapore Launches New Website|url=https://www.finews.asia/finance/23605-swiss-business-association-sba-tom-ludescher-thomas-kupfer-ambassador|publisher=finews.asia|accessdate=May 7, 2018|date=December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; throughout 2016 as well as in 2017 the launch of the inaugural Swiss Business Award honoring “Excellence in People &amp; Skills Development”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Inaugural SwissCham Award For Workforce Development|url=https://www.finews.asia/high-end/24763-inaugural-swisscham-award-for-workforce-development|publisher=finews.asia|accessdate=May 7, 2018|date=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
==Core activities==

The mandate of the SwissCham is to represent and advocate its members’ interests and offer a platform for practicing and living the Swiss networking culture, following the overarching goal of promoting and fostering the Swiss trade, services, manufacturing and investments in Singapore. Its core activities are grouped in four main pillars: Firstly, a 360 degree networking platform for interacting among members as well as with other Singaporean companies and professionals, other chambers of commerce as well as other Swiss organizations in Singapore. Secondly, a broad range of attractive events including member presentations, knowledge sharing or cultural and social events to get a better understanding of Singapore, its history and the resulting business and networking culture. Thirdly, advocating work for its members interests towards the Swiss authorities in Switzerland and in Singapore, towards the local authorities in Singapore (primarily through its standing seat in the board of governors of the European Chamber of Commerce in Singapore), and towards other business organizations through regular interactions in industry group meetings. And fourthly, a selective range of services and benefits offered to its members, including an online [[FAQ]] with key knowledge for setting up and running a business in Singapore from a Swiss perspective, or on-demand support for members with regards to business relevant topics such as access to relevant industry or market data, or regulatory or labour market aspects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Swiss business association keen to play a bigger role|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/hub/swiss-state-visit/swiss-business-association-keen-to-play-a-bigger-role|publisher=The Business Times|accessdate=May 7, 2018|date=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Swiss Business Award introduced in 2017 rewards and recognizes Singapore-based companies for their efforts and initiatives in developing their workforce through ‘Excellence in People &amp; Skills Development’. [[Education]] and talent development are particularly relevant for Singapore and Switzerland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Don’t go to university!|url=http://wuethrich.eu/en/2016/12/04/geht-nicht-die-uni/|publisher=Christa Wuethrich|accessdate=May 7, 2018|date=December 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;, both of which having repeatedly topped worldwide educational rankings such as the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] published each year by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], or the [[Global Innovation Index]] published each year by [[INSEAD]] and the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]]. The nominations for the Swiss Business Award are evaluated by an independent jury consisting of high ranking representatives from business and academia in Singapore. Singapore-based [[Firmenich]] Asia Pte. Ltd. won the inaugural Swiss Business Award in 2017 for its dedication to local workforce&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Giving top priority to people and skills|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/hub/swiss-national-day-2017/giving-top-priority-to-people-and-skills|publisher=The Business Times|accessdate=May 7, 2018|date=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Tan Kin Lian''' is a Singaporean businessman and social activist, and former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of [[NTUC Income]]. Since stepping down as CEO in April 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Free/Story/STIStory_156317.html | title=New Income chief creates new buzz | date=10 September 2007 | accessdate=3 October 2010 | author=Lorna Tan | authorlink=Lorna Tan | newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418052206/http://www.straitstimes.com/Free/Story/STIStory_156317.html | archivedate=18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; his activities have included organising public rallies for people who lost their money due to investing in [[Lehman Brothers]]' [[Minibond]] products to seek redress,&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=asigYSI14dIM&amp;refer=asia | title=Singapore Investors to Seek Compensation on Lehman Minibonds | publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] | date=18 October 2008 | accessdate=3 October 2010 | last=Shiyin | first=Chen}}&lt;/ref&gt; and setting up FISCA, an organisation to teach people about long-term financial security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1000782/1/.html | title=New consumer watchdog to look after interests of retail investors | publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]] | date=25 August 2009 | accessdate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he indicated that if sufficient people want him to, he would be willing to stand as a candidate for the next election of the [[President of Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asiaone.com/Digital/News/Story/A1Story20090120-116002.html | title=Making money from cyber chatter | publisher=[[Asiaone]] | accessdate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/the%2BStraits%2BTimes/Story/A1Story20081123-102695.html | title=Tan Kin Lian eyes elected presidency | publisher=[[AsiaOne]] | date=23 November 2008 | accessdate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tan stood in the [[Singaporean presidential election, 2011|2011 Presidential Election]] and finished in fourth place out of four candidates with 4.91% of votes.

==Business career==

===Director and CEO of NTUC Income===

Tan became the general manager of [[NTUC Income]] Insurance Co-Operative in 1977, at the age of 29, subsequently re-designated as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and remained in this position until April 2007.&lt;ref name="2006Transition.pdf"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.income.com.sg/aboutus/annreport/2006Transition.pdf | title=Transition – NTUC Income | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915151730/http://www.income.com.sg/aboutus/annreport/2006Transition.pdf | archivedate=15 September 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his leadership the company has grown from having S$28 million in assets in 1977 to more than S$17 billion in assets and over one million policyholders in 2007.&lt;ref name="2006Transition.pdf"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.income.com.sg/aboutus/factsheet.asp | title=NTUC Income – About Us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tan ran NTUC Income with the aim of providing the best value to the policyholders. This meant lower fees for insurance agents, encouragement of direct selling practices which bypassed the agents altogether,&lt;ref&gt;Dhaliwal, Rav. ''Income sets up info centre for walk-in customers''. The Straits Times, 25 Dec 1990&lt;/ref&gt; and low operating expenses (throughout his 30-year CEO term Tan flew economy class, even on long haul flights). This management style clashed with some of NTUC Income's board members, who preferred the Co-Operative to be run on a more commercial or professional basis, and even advocated it to be privatised. The board asked Tan to step down after completing his 30-year term at the helm.&lt;ref&gt;Wong Lim Hoh, Robin Chan. ''Ex-Income Chief asked to quit co-op''. The Sunday Times, 7 Aug 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other positions===

Tan’s 2007 CV mentions more than 60 directorships and other corporate appointments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tankinlian.com/admin/file.aspx?id=535 | title=CV of Tan Kin Lian up to 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326075728/http://tankinlian.com/admin/file.aspx?id=535 | archivedate=26 March 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, the most notable is the chairmanship of International Co-operative &amp; Mutual Insurance Federation (1992–1997),&lt;ref&gt;Kooi Cho Teng. ''NTUC Income general manager to chair world body''. The Business Times, 16 June 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Income GM first Asian to head world insurance co-op''. The Straits Times, 16 June 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uwcc.wisc.edu/icic/orgs/ica/pubs/review/ICA-Review-Vol--90--No--2--19971/International-Co-operative-and-Mutual-In1.html | title=International Co-operative and Mutual Insurance Federation (ICMIF) (1997)}}&lt;/ref&gt; an international organisation which at that time represented 123 insurance groups in 65 countries, employing 260,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icmif.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.icmif.org/who-we-are | title=ICMIF – Who We Are}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total assets of the members of this international federation totalled US$1.5 trillion (1997 figure).

===Post-retirement interlude===

Since retiring from [[NTUC Income]] in 2007, Tan provides free financial advice and opinions on current affairs through his blog,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tankinlian.blogspot.com | title=Tan Kin Lian's Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; and establishing Financial Service Consumer Association (FISCA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://easyapps.sg/assn/Org/Default.aspx?id=5 | title=FISCA | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702194434/http://easyapps.sg/assn/Org/Default.aspx?id=5 | archivedate=2 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; to teach people about long-term financial security. During the [[2008 financial crisis]], he organised public rallies for people who lost their money due to investing in [[Lehman Brothers]]' [[Minibond]] products.&lt;ref name="bloomberg" /&gt; The rallies resulted in a petition to Singapore government, signed by 983 investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tankinlian.blogspot.com/2008/10/petition-to-singapore-government-983.html | title=Petition to Singapore Government – 983 Signatures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friendship with Ong Teng Cheong===

Tan was close to [[Ong Teng Cheong]], the fifth [[President of Singapore]]. When Ong was elected as President, Tan presented him a set of orchid motif ties in different colours, which were commissioned by [[NTUC Income]] and made in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="tie"&gt;Koh, Veronica. ''Singapore's very own – the President's Tie''. The Straits Times, 25 Dec 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Ong liked the tie in red color and used it on a number of important occasions, including Nomination Day and his inauguration as the President of Singapore.&lt;ref name="tie" /&gt; He also wore it for his presidential portrait which was displayed in government offices and other organisations.&lt;ref name="tie" /&gt; 
	
Tan was involved in several causes promoted by Ong, such as the [[Singapore Dance Theatre]] (SDT), the first Singapore expedition to [[Mount Everest]], and the [[President's Charity]]. Tan promoted the SDT performances to the policyholders of NTUC Income and later joined the board of directors, where he served for 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;Cheah Ui-Hoon. ''Have dance, will travel''. The Business Times, Singapore, 19 June 1999&lt;/ref&gt; NTUC Income became one of the main sponsors of the Mount Everest expedition.

During the last two years of Ong Teng Cheong's term, Tan chaired the President's Charity event to raise funds and to promote the Singapore Dress.&lt;ref&gt;''Record $400,000 raised so far.''. The Straits Times, 25 Aug 2001&lt;/ref&gt; When Ong's wife died, shortly after the second charity dinner, Tan organised 1,000 messages of condolences from Singaporeans, submitted through the Internet, and presented the book to Ong.&lt;ref&gt;Tan Kin Lian. ''LETTER – Fly flag at half-mast for First Lady's funeral''. The Straits Times, 3 Aug 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Tan is married to Tay Siew Hong and has two daughters, one son, and two granddaughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tankinlian.blogspot.com/2011/06/my-grandaughters-vera-and-nadya.html | title=My granddaughters – Vera and Nadya}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoys making puzzles (Sudoku, Logic9,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tankinlian.blogspot.com/2010/08/learn-sudoku-logic9.html | title=Learn Sudoku, Logic9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Shape Quiz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svVY82K0_iA | title=Shape Quiz – New Layout}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and online games (Family Life, Business Simulation)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.easysearch.sg/ | title=Online Portal for various games and applications developed by Tan Kin Lian | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829012735/http://easysearch.sg/ | archivedate=29 August 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; that stimulate creative abilities and teach risk management.

==Political career==

Tan was a member of Singapore's governing political party, the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP), for 30 years but left in 2008 because of inactivity and disagreement with the party's value system. He was previously the party's branch secretary at [[Marine Parade]] for three years and was chosen in 1977 by [[Goh Chok Tong]], then a new [[Member of Parliament]] (MP), to test a pilot scheme for setting up block committees, now known as residents' committees. For the first 10 years, Tan was active in [[Marine Parade]] constituency but became inactive for the next 20 years, after he moved to [[Thomson Road, Singapore|Upper Thomson]] and later to [[Yio Chu Kang]] areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_305814.html | title=Tan Kin Lian eyes presidency |work=Straits Times |location=Singapore  | accessdate=9 June 2011 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316094937/http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking+News/Singapore/Story/STIStory_305814.html | archivedate=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tan himself, he was asked to stand for elections to Parliament twice, in 1979 and 1985 (exact dates uncertain). He declined both times, earlier because of his work commitments and later because he disagreed with the direction of the party policy on issues such as [[Conscription in Singapore|National Service]] and the [[Population control in Singapore#The demographic transition and the Graduate Mothers Scheme|Graduate Mothers Scheme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tankinlian.blogspot.com/2011/06/smear-campaign-in-sammyboy-forum.html | title=Smears in blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 presidential elections===
[[File:Tan-Kin-Lian-speaking-to-the-media-after-submitting-election-forms.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.2|Tan speaking to the media after submitting election forms]]

Tan sent early signals in 2008 that he wants to be Singapore's next president.

On 7 June 2011, Tan announced that he would be running for the [[Singaporean presidential election, 2011|presidency]]. Following this, he promised to donate a significant part of the S$4 million presidential salary to a specially formed charity and circulated several statements outlining his position on the role of the president, including a controversial statement on safeguarding the reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.easyapps.sg/tklep/Frame.aspx?ID=13 | title=Safeguarding the Reserves }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The statements drew a mild rebuke from senior members of the Singapore government, who attempted to publicly clarify that the elected President has only "custodial powers" and not "executive powers". In response, Tan issued another statement, where he agreed with the limitations but nevertheless stressed that "the president does not need to be armed with strong executive powers to make an impact. A well qualified and properly elected President will make his impact through the power to persuade, to influence, to counsel, to convey feedback and if necessary, to articulate informed positions on specific issues".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.easyapps.sg/tklep/Frame.aspx?ID=20 | title=Statement by Tan Kin Lian – role of the Elected President }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 July 2011, Tan submitted the presidential eligibility forms.&lt;ref name="form1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Han|first=WeiChou|title=Presidential hopefuls Tony Tan and Tan Kin Lian submit papers|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1139430/1/.html|accessdate=7 July 2011|newspaper=[[Channel NewsAsia]]|date=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tan had submitted his application for the Certificate of Eligibility under a Special Clause, citing his experience as CEO of an insurance cooperative with a shared capital of S$500 million and assets of S$17 billion. He was granted the Certificate of Eligibility on 11 August 2011 along with the other three candidates.

[[File:Poster of Tan Kin Lian for the Singaporean presidential election - 20110828-02.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Tan's election poster on a lamppost along [[River Valley, Singapore|River Valley Road]].]]

In an interview with [[Channel NewsAsia]], Tan said whay his main reason for running: "Many people said they want voice, they want to be heard. I think I probably represent the person who has got ears to listen and is able to think independently." Tan thinks the role of the Elected President should be expanded and has suggested, for example, having the President's Office produce an annual report detailing the country's reserves. "I recognise that the President cannot be a second centre of power but that does not mean the President cannot do anything, because in order to make good decisions it's better to have several points of views," he said. Tan has pledged to donate a significant part of the annual S$4 million presidential salary to charity.

In response to rumours circulating that Tan would be dropping out of the presidential race early, he has refuted such claims and expressed that he would be filing his nomination papers as planned on 17 August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Choo|first=Evelyn|title=Tan Kin Lian not pulling out of presidential race|url=http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC110814-0000216/Tan-Kin-Lian-not-pulling-out-of-presidential-race|accessdate=15 August 2011|newspaper=Today|date=14 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614060158/http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC110814-0000216/Tan-Kin-Lian-not-pulling-out-of-presidential-race|archivedate=14 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He submitted his nomination forms on 17 August. In his nomination day speech, Tan was the only candidate who spoke in four official languages of Singapore (English, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil).

Tan advocates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tankinlian.blogspot.com/2009/08/burden-of-national-service-has-to-be.html |title=Tan Kin Lian's Blog: Burden of National Service |publisher=Tankinlian.blogspot.com |date=23 August 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the need for the burden of [[Conscription in Singapore|National Service]] to be shared by all segments of the society, including females and noncitizens.

Tan's symbol is a "Hi-5". He explained "the raised hand signifies willingness to do public service, while the five fingers signify his values of honesty, fairness, positive attitude, courage and public service."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=See|first=Sharon|title=PE: Candidates unveil election symbols|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1147568/1/.html|accessdate=22 August 2011|newspaper=Channel News Asia|date=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In less than three hours of the vote count, Tan conceded defeat. He got the lowest votes of all the candidates, with only 4.9% of the votes. For failing to achieve at least 12.5% of the votes, Tan also lost his S$48,000 deposit.

'''Validation''' is the process of establishing documentary evidence demonstrating that a procedure, process, or activity carried out in testing and then production maintains the desired level of compliance at all stages. In the pharmaceutical industry, it is very important that in addition to final testing and compliance of products, it is also assured that the process will consistently produce the expected results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pharmacistspharmajournal.org/2010/03/validation-in-pharmaceutical.html  Validation definition and FDA, Regulatory agencies guidelines requirement] Accessed 27 Feb 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The desired results are established in terms of specifications for outcome of the process. Qualification of systems and equipment is therefore a part of the process of validation. Validation is a requirement of food, drug and pharmaceutical regulating agencies such as the US FDA and their [[good manufacturing practice]]s guidelines. Since a wide variety of procedures, processes, and activities need to be validated, the field of validation is divided into a number of subsections including the following:
*Equipment validation
*Facilities validation
*HVAC system validation
*[[Cleaning validation]]
*[[Process Validation]]
*Analytical method validation
*Computer system validation
*[[Packaging]] validation
*[[Cold chain]] validation

Similarly, the activity of qualifying systems and equipment is divided into a number of subsections including the following:
*Design qualification (DQ)
*Component qualification (CQ)
*Installation qualification (IQ)
*Operational qualification (OQ)
*Performance qualification (PQ)

==History==
The concept of validation was first proposed by two [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) officials, Ted Byers and Bud Loftus, in 1979 in USA, to improve the quality of pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Validation: an unconventional review and reinvention | author=Agalloco, J. | journal=Validation: an unconventional review and reinvention | year=1995 | volume=49 | issue=4 | pages=175–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed in direct response to several problems in the sterility of large volume [[parenteral]] market.  The first validation activities were focused on the processes involved in making these products, but quickly spread to associated processes including environmental control, media fill, equipment [[Disinfection|sanitization]] and purified water production.

The concept of validation was first developed for equipment and processes and derived from the engineering practices used in delivery of large pieces of equipment that would be manufactured, tested, delivered and accepted according to a contract&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, A., Kahny-Simonius, J., Plattner, M., Schmidli-Vckovski, V., &amp; Kronseder, C. (1998), 'Computer system validation: An overview of official requirements and standards', Pharmaceutica Acta Helvetiae, vol. 72, no. 6, pp.&amp;nbsp;317–325.
&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of validation spread to other areas of industry after several large-scale problems highlighted the potential risks in the design of products.  The most notable is the [[Therac-25]] incident.&lt;ref&gt;Leveson, N. G. &amp; Turner, C. S. (1993), 'An investigation of the Therac-25 accidents', Computer, vol. 26, no. 7, pp.&amp;nbsp;18–41.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, the software for a large radiotherapy device was poorly designed and tested. In use, several interconnected problems led to several devices giving doses of radiation several thousands of times higher than intended, which resulted in the death of three patients and several more being permanently injured.

In 2005 an individual wrote a standard by which the transportation process could be validated for cold chain products.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  This standard was written for a biological manufacturing company and was then written into the PDA's Technical Report # 39, thus establishing the industry standard for cold chain validation.  This was critical for the industry due to the sensitivity of drug substances, biologics and vaccines to various temperature conditions.  The FDA has also been very focused on this final area of distribution and the potential for a drug substances quality to be impacted by extreme temperature exposure.

==Reasons for validation==
FDA, or any other food and drugs regulatory agency around the globe not only ask for a product that meets its specification but also require a process, procedures, intermediate stages of inspections, and testing adopted during manufacturing are designed such that when they are adopted they produce consistently similar, reproducible, desired results which meet the quality standard of product being manufactured and Complies the Regulatory and Security Aspects. Such procedures are developed through the process of validation. This is to maintain and assure a higher degree of quality of food and drug products.  
''"process validation is defined as the collection and evaluation of
data, from the process design stage through commercial production, which establishes scientific
evidence that a process is capable of consistently delivering quality product. Process validation
involves a series of activities taking place over the lifecycle of the product and process."''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Guidelines on General Principles of Process Validation | author=FDA | year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; A properly designed system will provide a high degree of assurance that every step, process, and change has been properly evaluated before its implementation. Testing a sample of a final product is not considered sufficient evidence that every product within a batch meets the required specification.

== Validation Master Plan ==

The [[Validation Master Plan]] is a document that describes how and when the validation program will be executed in a facility. Even though it is not mandatory, it is the document that outlines the principles involved in the qualification of a facility, defines the areas and systems to be validated and provides a written program for achieving and maintaining a qualified facility with validated processes. It is the foundation for the validation program and should include process validation, facility and utility qualification and validation, equipment qualification, cleaning and computer validation. The regulations also set out an expectation that the different parts of the production process are well defined and controlled, such that the results of that production will not substantially change over time.

==The validation process==

[[File:Traditional2.png|thumb|'''Figure 1: Traditional Qualification Process (adapted from the typical V-Model''')|375px]]
The validation scope, boundaries and responsibilities for each process or groups of similar processes or similar equipment's must be documented and approved in a validation plan.  These documents, terms and references for the protocol authors are for use in setting the scope of their protocols.  It must be based on a Validation Risk Assessment (VRA) to ensure that the scope of validation being authorised is appropriate for the complexity and importance of the equipment or process under validation.  Within the references given in the VP the protocol authors must ensure that all aspects of the process or equipment under qualification; that may affect the efficacy, quality and or records of the product are properly qualified. Qualification includes the following steps:

*Design qualification (DQ)- Demonstrates that the proposed design (or the existing design for an off-the-shelf item) will satisfy all the requirements that are defined and detailed in the User Requirements Specification (URS).  Satisfactory execution of the DQ is a mandatory requirement before construction (or procurement) of the new design can be authorised.
*Installation qualification (IQ) – Demonstrates that the process or equipment meets all specifications, is installed correctly, and all required components and documentation needed for continued operation are installed and in place.
*Operational qualification (OQ) – Demonstrates that all facets of the process or equipment are operating correctly.
*Performance qualification (PQ) – Demonstrates that the process or equipment performs as intended in a consistent manner over time.
* Component qualification (CQ) – is a relatively new term developed in 2005.  This term refers to the manufacturing of auxiliary components to ensure that they are manufactured to the correct design criteria.  This could include packaging components such as folding cartons, shipping cases, labels or even phase change material.  All of these components must have some type of random inspection to ensure that the third party manufacturer's process is consistently producing components that are used in the world of GMP at drug or biologic manufacturer.

There are instances when it is more expedient and efficient to transfer some tests or inspections from the IQ to the OQ, or from the OQ to the PQ. This is allowed for in the regulations, provided that a clear and approved justification is documented in the Validation Plan (VP).

[[File:OPQ Adaptation of V-Model.png|thumb|'''Figure 2: OPQ Validation Process (adapted from the typical V-Model''')|375px]]
This combined testing of OQ and PQ phases is sanctioned by the European Commission Enterprise Directorate-General within ‘Annex 15  to the EU Guide to Good Manufacturing Practice guide’ (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;6) which states that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''Although PQ is described as a separate activity, it may in some cases be appropriate to perform it in conjunction with OQ.''"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Computer System Validation==
This requirement has naturally expanded to encompass computer systems used both in the development and production of, and as a part of [[pharmaceutical]] products, [[medical devices]], food, blood establishments, tissue establishments, and clinical trials.  In 1983 the FDA published a guide to the inspection of Computerized Systems in Pharmaceutical Processing, also known as the 'bluebook'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Guide to Inspection of Computerised Systems (The Blue Book) | author=FDA | journal=US Food and Drug Administration, Maryland, USA | year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recently both the American FDA and the UK [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] have added sections to the regulations specifically for the use of computer systems. In the UK, computer validation is covered in Annex 11 of the EU GMP regulations (EMEA 2011). The FDA introduced 21 CFR Part 11 for rules on the use of electronic records, electronic signatures (FDA 1997).
The FDA regulation is harmonized with ISO 8402:1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=ISO 8402:1994: Quality management and quality assurance—Vocabulary | author=International Organization for Standardization, Geneva, Switzerland | year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; which treats "[[Verification and validation|verification]]" and "[[Verification and validation|validation]]" as separate and distinct terms.  On the other hand, many software engineering journal articles and textbooks use the terms "verification" and "validation" interchangeably, or in some cases refer to software "[[Verification and Validation (software)|verification]], validation, and [[Software testing|testing]] ([[VV&amp;T]])" as if it is a single concept, with no distinction among the three terms.
The General Principles of Software Validation (FDA 2002)  defines verification as 
''"Software verification provides objective evidence that the design outputs of a particular phase of the software development life cycle meet all of the specified requirements for that phase."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm085371.pdf | title=General Principles of Software Validation; Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff | publisher=US FDA | year=2002 | accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It also defines Validation as
''"Confirmation by examination and provision of objective evidence that software specifications conform to user needs and intended uses, and that the particular requirements implemented through software can be consistently fulfilled"''. The software validation guideline states: “The software development process should be sufficiently well planned, controlled, and documented to detect and correct unexpected results from software changes." Annex 11 states "The validation documentation and reports should cover the relevant steps of the life
cycle."

Weichel (2004) recently found that over twenty warning letters issued by the FDA to pharmaceutical companies specifically cited problems in Computer System Validation between 1997 and 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Survey of Published FDA Warning Letters with Comment on Part 11 (21 CFR Part 11) | author=Weichel, P. | journal=Journal of Validation Technology | year=2004 | volume=11 | issue=1 | pages=62–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the best known industry guidance available is the GAMP Guide, now in its fifth edition and known as GAMP5 published by ISPE (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=GAMP5: Risk Based Approach to Computer Compliance | author=ISPE | journal=International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineers, Tampa, FL. | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This guidance gives practical advice on how to satisfy regulatory requirements.

===Scope of Computer Validation===
The definition of validation above discusses production of evidence that a system will meet its specification.  This definition does not refer to a computer application or a computer system but to a process.  The main implications in this are that validation should cover all aspects of the process including the application, any hardware that the application uses, any interfaces to other systems, the users, training and documentation as well as the management of the system and the validation itself after the system is put into use.  The PIC/S guideline (PIC/S 2004) defines this as a 'computer related system'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Good Practices for Computerised Systems in Regulated "GXP" Environments, Report PI 011-2 | author=PIC/S | journal=Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention, Geneva | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Much effort is expended within the industry upon validation activities, and several journals are dedicated to both the process and methodology around validation, and the science behind it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Considerations for Improving Software Validation, Securing better assurance for less cost | author=Smith, H. G. | journal=Journal of Validation Technology | year=2001 | volume=7 | issue=2 | pages=150–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=A Validation Approach for Laboratory Information Management Systems |author1=Tracy, D. S.  |author2=Nash, R. A.  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=Journal of Validation Technology | year=2002 | volume=9 | issue=1 | pages=6–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Testing Times in Computer Validation | author=Lucas, I. | journal=Journal of Validation Technology | year=2003 | volume=9 | issue=2 | pages=153–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Taming the Regulatory Beast: Regulation vs Functionalism |author1=Balogh, M.  |author2=Corbin, V.  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=Pharmaceutical Technology Europe | year=2005 | volume=17 | issue=3 | pages=55–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk Based Approach To Computer Validation===

In the recent years, a risk-based approach has been adopted within the industry, where the testing of computer systems (emphasis on finding problems) is wide-ranging and documented but not heavily evidenced (i.e. hundreds of screen prints are not gathered during testing).  Annex 11 states "Risk management should be applied throughout the lifecycle of the computerised system taking into account patient safety, data integrity and product quality. As part of a risk management system, decisions on the extent of validation and data integrity controls should be based on a justified and documented risk assessment of the computerised system."

The subsequent validation or verification of computer systems targets only the "[[GxP]] critical" requirements of computer systems. Evidence (e.g. screen prints) is gathered to document the validation exercise.  In this way it is assured that systems are thoroughly tested, and that validation and documentation of the "GxP critical" aspects is performed in a risk-based manner, optimizing effort and ensuring that computer system's fitness for purpose is demonstrated.

The overall risk posed by a computer system is now generally considered to be a function of system complexity, patient/product impact, and pedigree (Configurable-Off-The-Shelf or Custom-written for a certain purpose).  A lower risk system should merit a less in-depth specification/testing/validation approach.  (e.g. The documentation surrounding a spreadsheet containing a simple but "GxP" critical calculation should not match that of a Chromatography Data System with 20 Instruments)

Determination of a "GxP critical" requirement for a computer system is subjective, and the definition needs to be tailored to the organisation involved.  However, in general a "GxP" requirement may be considered to be a requirement which leads to the development/configuration of a computer function which has a direct impact on patient safety,
the pharmaceutical product being processed, or has been developed/configured to meet a regulatory requirement. In addition if a function has a direct impact on GxP data (security or integrity) it may be considered "GxP critical".

==Product life cycle approach in validation==
Validation process efforts must account for the complete product life cycle, including developmental procedures adapted for qualification of a drug product commencing with its research and development phase, rationale for adapting a best fit formula which represents the relationship between required outputs and specified inputs, and procedure for manufacturing. Each step is required to be justified and monitored in order to provide a good quality food and drug product. The FDA emphasizes the product life cycle approach in its evaluation of manufacturer regulatory compliance as well.

{{Use British English|date=March 2015}}
The '''workforce''' or '''labour force''' ('''labor force''' in [[American English]]; [[American and British English spelling differences#-our, -or|see spelling differences]]) is the [[Labour (economics)|labour]] [[pooling (resource management)|pool]] in [[employment]].  It is generally used to describe those working for a single [[types of companies|company]] or [[industry]], but can also apply to a geographic region like a city, state, or country. Within a company, its value can be labelled as its "Workforce in Place". The workforce of a country includes both the employed and the unemployed. The '''labour force participation rate''', '''LFPR''' (or '''economic activity rate''', '''EAR'''), is the ratio between the labour force and the overall size of their [[Generational cohorts|cohort]] (national population of the same age range). The term generally excludes the [[Employment#Employer|employer]]s or [[management]], and can imply those involved in [[manual labour]]. It may also mean all those who are available for work.

==Formal and informal==
Formal labour is any sort of [[employment]] that is structured and paid in a formal way.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Seager, Joni. 2008. The Penguin Atlas of Women in the World. 4th ed. New York: Penguin Books. Part 5&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[informal sector]] of the economy, formal labour within a country contributes to that country's [[gross national product]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Informal sector]]&lt;/ref&gt; Informal labour is labour that falls short of being a formal arrangement in law or in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson, Allan. "Empowerment of the Poor in Informal Employment." Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor (Jan. 2006): 1–10. Print&lt;/ref&gt; It can be paid or unpaid and it is always unstructured and unregulated.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Seager, Joni. 2008. The Penguin Atlas of Women in the World. 4th ed. New York: Penguin Books. Part 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Formal employment is more reliable than informal employment. Generally, the former yields higher income and greater benefits and securities for both men and women.&lt;ref name="autogenerated36"&gt;Chen, Martha, Joann Vanek, Francie Lund, James Heintz with Renana Jhabvala, and Christine Bonner. 2005. "Employment, Gender, and Poverty," in Progress of the World's Women, pp. 36–57. New York: United Nations Development Fund for Women&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informal labour===
The contribution of informal labourers is immense. Informal labour is expanding globally, most significantly in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref name="worldbank1"&gt;Chen, Martha Alter. "Women in the Informal Sector: A Global Picture, The Global Movement." World Bank: 1–10. World Bank Info. Web. 5 Apr. 2011.etools/docs/library/76309/dc2002/proceedings/pdfpaper/module6mc.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113204603/http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/76309/dc2002/proceedings/pdfpaper/module6mc.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study done by Jacques Charmes, in the year 2000 informal labour made up 57% of non-agricultural employment, 40% of urban employment, and 83% of the new jobs in Latin America. That same year, informal labour made up 78% of non-agricultural employment, 61% of urban employment, and 93% of the new jobs in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Charmes, Jacques. "Informal Sector, Poverty and Gender: A Review of Empirical Evidence." World Development Report (Feb. 2000): 1–9. Centre of Economics and Ethics. Web. 5 Apr. 2011. {{cite web |url=http://www.wiego.org/papers/charmes3.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225122754/http://wiego.org/papers/charmes3.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly after an economic crisis, labourers tend to shift from the formal sector to the informal sector. This trend was seen after the [[Asian economic crisis]] which began in 1997.&lt;ref name="worldbank1"/&gt;

===Informal labour and gender===
[[Gender]] is frequently associated with informal labour. Women are employed more often informally than they are formally, and informal labour is an overall larger source of employment for females than it is for males.&lt;ref name="autogenerated36"/&gt; Women frequent the informal sector of the economy through occupations like home-based workers and [[Hawker (trade)|street vendors]].&lt;ref name="worldbank1"/&gt;  The Penguin Atlas of Women in the World shows that in the 1990s, 81% of women in Benin were street vendors, 55% in Guatemala, 44% in Mexico, 33% in Kenya, and 14% in India. Overall, 60% of women workers in the developing world are employed in the informal sector.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4" /&gt;

The specific percentages are 84% and 58% for women in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Latin America]] respectively.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4" /&gt; The percentages for men in both of these areas of the world are lower, amounting to 63% and 48% respectively.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4" /&gt; In Asia, 65% of women workers and 65% of men workers are employed in the informal sector.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; Globally, a large percentage of women that are formally employed also work in the informal sector behind the scenes. These women make up the hidden work force.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

==Agricultural and non-agricultural labour==
[[File:Employed civilians by occupation and sex - 2007.png|thumbnail|This is a chart showing employed civilians by occupation and sex in 2007 in the US]]
Formal and informal labour can be divided into the subcategories of [[agricultural]] work and non-agricultural work. [[Martha Chen]] ''et al.'' believe these four categories of labour are closely related to one another.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;Chen, Martha, Joann Vanek, Francie Lund, James Heintz with Renana Jhabvala, and Christine Bonner. 2005. "Employment, Gender, and Poverty," in Progress of the World's Women, pp. 36–57. New York: United Nations Development Fund for Women.&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of agricultural work is informal, which the Penguin Atlas for Women in the World defines as unregistered or unstructured.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; Non-agricultural work can also be informal. According to Martha Chen, informal labour makes up 48% of non-agricultural work in North Africa, 51% in Latin America, 65% in Asia, and 72% in Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="autogenerated36"/&gt;

===Agriculture and gender===
The [[agricultural sector]] of the economy has remained stable in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.AGR.EMPL.ZS/countries/1W-US-C5?display=graph|title=Employment in agriculture (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate) - Data|author=|date=|website=data.worldbank.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304095951/http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.AGR.EMPL.ZS/countries/1W-US-C5?display=graph|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Penguin Atlas of Women in the World, women make up 40% of the agricultural labour force in most parts of the world, while in developing countries they make up 67% of the agricultural workforce.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; Joni Seager shows in her atlas that specific tasks within agricultural work are also gendered. For example, for the production of wheat in a village in Northwest China, men perform the ploughing, the planting, and the spraying, while women perform the weeding, the fertilising, the processing, and the storage.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

In terms of [[food production]] worldwide, the atlas shows that women produce 80% of the food in Sub-Saharan Africa, 50% in Asia, 45% in the Caribbean, 25% in North Africa and in the Middle East, and 25% in Latin America.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; A majority of the work women do on the farm is considered housework and is therefore negligible in employment statistics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

==Paid and unpaid==
Paid and [[unpaid work]] are also closely related with formal and informal labour. Some informal work is unpaid, or paid under the table.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt; Unpaid work can be work that is done at home to sustain a family, like child care work, or actual habitual daily labour that is not monetarily rewarded, like working the fields.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;  Unpaid workers have zero [[earnings]], and although their work is valuable, it is hard to estimate its true value. The controversial debate still stands. Men and women tend to work in different areas of the economy, regardless of whether their work is paid or unpaid. Women focus on the [[service sector]], while men focus on the [[industrial sector]].

===Unpaid labour and gender===
Women usually work fewer hours in income generating jobs than men do.&lt;ref name="autogenerated36"/&gt;  Often it is [[Homemaking|housework]] that is unpaid. Worldwide, women and girls are responsible for a great amount of household work.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

The Penguin Atlas of Women in the World, published in 2008, stated that in Madagascar, women spend 20 hours per week on housework, while men spend only two.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; In Mexico, women spend 33 hours and men spend 5 hours.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; In Mongolia the housework hours amount to 27 and 12 for women and men respectively.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; In Spain, women spend 26 hours on housework and men spend 4 hours.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; Only in the Netherlands do men spend 10% more time than women do on activities within the home or for the household.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

The Penguin Atlas of Women in the World also stated that in developing countries, women and girls spend a significant amount of time fetching water for the week, while men do not. For example, in Malawi women spend 6.3 hours per week fetching water, while men spend 43 minutes. Girls in Malawi spend 3.3 hours per week fetching water, and boys spend 1.1 hours.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; Even if women and men both spend time on household work and other unpaid activities, this work is also gendered.&lt;ref name="autogenerated36"/&gt;

=== Unearned pay and gender ===
In the United Kingdom in 2014, two-thirds of workers on long-term sick leave were women, despite women only constituting half of the workforce, even after excluding maternity leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Women make up two thirds of workers on long-term sick leave|last=Watts|first=Joseph|date=11 February 2014|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|access-date=|page=10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unemployment in the United States ===
Unemployment is defined as the number of able men and women of working age seeking employment. When unemployment percentages are shown it does not categorize all men and women who are out of work. It only accounts for the men and women who are actively seeking employment. To those who are no longer looking for work they are simply categorized as "out of the workforce". As of February 2018 the unemployment rate for the United States was 4.1%. The below is a list of unemployment rates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics since 2000.
