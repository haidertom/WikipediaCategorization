Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica 2007 Ultimate Reference Suite . Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Basis==
In [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] the basis of any particular type of classification is the ''way in which objects in the domain resemble each other''. A resemblance of a type that seems appropriate to the classification that we propose, we may call an '''''affinity''''', and when we decide how to classify say, a specimen of rock or butterfly, we justify our decision according to the affinities that we observe. 

Other resemblances we dismiss as being out of context or at least non-cogent; for example, in deciding whether to classify a lizard as having closer affinities to a snake than to a table, biologists rely on affinities such as the scales, blood, physiology, vertebral anatomy, and reproductive system as being more relevant than the possession of four "feet".

==Application and obstacles==
Analysing and determining the proper classification of an organism, a rock, or an astronomic object according to a particular system is often a difficult and treacherous procedure. Problems in such fields of study have tripped up whole generations of workers in recent centuries. When the position is not clear from an early stage, the first step after beginning to determine, evaluate, and describe the [[Variable and attribute (research)|attributes]] of the object, is to determine the affinities and evaluate their significance. 

The number of legs might well be a significant affinity in comparing different types of related organisms such as [[crustacean]]s, but irrelevant in comparing a ten-limbed [[Cephalopoda|cephalopod]] with a ten-limbed [[Solifugae|solifugid]] (including its [[pedipalp]]s as limbs). Such a comparison would be no more cogent than the foregoing example of the lizard and the table.

There are many such examples in nature; we see both a [[lungfish]] and a [[porpoise]] as having closer (but largely different) affinities to a cow than to a [[tuna]], and a [[bat]] as having closer affinities to a [[banteng]] than to a bird or a butterfly, although a banteng has no "wings". These are considerations arising from the principles discussed in articles on [[Homology (biology)]] and [[Analogy (biology)]]. 

It is clear that there is an element of subjectivity to the recognition of affinities; that is implicit in such dictionary definitions as: ""Affinity: the closeness of relation between plants as shown by similarity of important organs."&lt;ref name="BotGloss"&gt;Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon; A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent; Published by Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. London, 4th ed 1928&lt;/ref&gt; That definition is over a century old, but it is typical of the basis on which taxonomists had to work till recently, and in practice still must use; it is not practical to sequence the genome of every specimen. Nucleic acid analyses are eroding many difficulties, but there is a long way to go.

{{Platonism}}
In [[philosophy]], '''anamnesis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|æ|m|ˈ|n|iː|s|ɪ|s}}; {{lang-grc|ἀνάμνησις}}) is a concept in [[Plato]]'s [[epistemology|epistemological]] and psychological theory that he develops in his [[dialogue]]s ''[[Meno (Plato)|Meno]]'' and ''[[Phaedo (Plato)|Phaedo]]'', and alludes to in his ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]''.

It is the idea that humans possess innate knowledge (perhaps acquired before birth) and that learning consists of rediscovering that knowledge within us.

==''Meno''==
In ''Meno'', Plato's character (and old teacher) [[Socrates]] is challenged by Meno with what has become known as the [[Sophism|sophistic]] paradox, or the paradox of knowledge:

:Meno:  And how are you going to search for [the nature of virtue] when you don't know at all what it is, Socrates?  Which of all the things you don't know will you set up as target for your search?  And even if you actually come across it, how will you know that it ''is'' that thing which you don't know?&lt;ref&gt;''[[Meno (Plato)|Meno]]'' 80d&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, if you don't know any of the attributes, properties, and/or other descriptive markers of any kind that help signify what something is (physical or otherwise), you won't recognize it, even if you come across it. And, as consequence, if the converse is true, and you ''do'' know the attributes, properties and/or other descriptive markers of this thing, then you shouldn't need to seek it out at all.  The result of this line of thinking is that, in either instance, there is no point trying to gain that "something"; in the case of Plato's aforementioned work, there is no point in seeking knowledge.

Socrates' response is to develop his theory of ''anamnesis''.  He suggests that the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is immortal, and repeatedly [[metempsychosis|incarnated]]; knowledge is in the soul from eternity (86b), but each time the soul is incarnated its knowledge is forgotten in the trauma of birth.  What one perceives to be learning, then, is the recovery of what one has forgotten.  (Once it has been brought back it is true belief, to be turned into genuine knowledge by understanding.)  And thus Socrates (and Plato) sees himself, not as a teacher, but as a [[Maieutics|midwife]], aiding with the birth of knowledge that was already there in the student.

The theory is illustrated by Socrates asking a slave boy questions about geometry.  At first the boy gives the wrong answer; when this is pointed out to him, he is puzzled, but by asking questions Socrates is able to help him to reach the correct answer.  This is intended to show that, as the boy wasn't told the answer, he could only have reached the truth by recollecting what he had already known but forgotten.

==''Phaedo''==
In ''[[Phaedo]]'', Plato develops his theory of ''anamnesis'', in part by combining it with his theory of [[Idea#Plato|Form]]s.  First, he elaborates how ''anamnesis'' can be achieved: whereas in ''Meno'' nothing more than Socrates' method of questioning is offered, in ''Phaedo'' Plato presents a way of living that would enable one to overcome the misleading nature of the body through ''[[Catharsis|katharsis]]'' (Greek: κάθαρσις; “cleansing” (from guilt or defilement), “purification”).  The body and its senses are the source of error; knowledge can only be regained through the use of our reason, contemplating things with the soul ([[noesis]]) (see 66 b–d).

Secondly, he makes clear that genuine knowledge, as opposed to mere true belief ([[doxa]]), is distinguished by its content.  One can only know eternal truths, for they are the only truths that can have been in the soul from eternity.  Though it can be very useful to have a true belief about, say, the best way to get from London to Oxford, such a belief does not qualify as knowledge; how could the human soul know such factually [[contingent propositions]] for all eternity?

==Neoplatonism==
For the later interpreters of Plato, ''anamnesis'' was less an [[epistemic]] assertion than an [[ontological]] one.  [[Plotinus]] himself did not posit recollection in the strict sense of the term, because all knowledge of universally important ideas ([[logos]]) came from a source outside of time (Dyad or the divine [[nous]]), and was accessible, by means of contemplation, to the soul as part of [[noesis]]. They were more objects of experience, of [[noesis|inner knowledge]] or [[insight]], than of recollection.  Despite this, in [[Neoplatonism]], the theory of ''anamnesis'' became part of the mythology of the descent of the soul.

[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s short work ''De Antro Nympharum'' (ostensibly a commentary on the brief passage in  ''Odyssey'' 13) elucidated this notion, as did [[Macrobius]]'s much longer ''Commentary on the Dream of Scipio''.  The idea of psychic memory was used by Neoplatonists to demonstrate the celestial and immaterial origins of the soul, and to explain how memories of the world-soul could be recalled by everyday human beings.  As such, psychic recollection was intrinsically connected to the Platonic conception of the soul itself.  Since the contents of individual "material" or physical memories were trivial, only the universal recollection of Forms, or divine objects, drew one closer to the immortal source of being.

''Anamnesis'' is the closest that human minds can come to experiencing the freedom of the soul prior to its being encumbered by matter.  The process of incarnation is described in Neoplatonism as a trauma that causes the soul to forget its experiences (and often its divine origins as well). The storyteller's voice is concealed by John and Plato in order to pursue their anamnetic efforts and to encourage the following generations to not only be readers but partakers in their original discussions on the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parsenios |first1=George L. |title=Anamnesis and the Silent Narrator in Plato and John |date=March 2017 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gratitude as an example of divine salvation was expressed by offering to God the first fruits of the harvest which maintains an identity with those who performed these actions in the past and therefore actualising them in the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cody|first=Alfred|date=January 2006|title=Little Historical Creed or little Historical Anamnesis|url=|journal=The Catholic Biblical Quarterly|volume=Jan 2006|pages=9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; that extends the [[Axiomatic design]]&lt;ref&gt;Suh (1990). ''The Principles of Design'', Oxford University Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-19-504345-6}}
&lt;/ref&gt; (AD) method. APDL covers the whole [[Product_lifecycle_management#Phases_of_product_lifecycle_and_corresponding_technologies|product lifecycle]] including early factors that affect the entire cycle such as development testing, input constraints and system components.

APDL provides an [[Iterative and incremental development|iterative and incremental]] way for a team of transdisciplinary members to approach [[Holism|holistic]] product development. A practical outcome includes capturing and managing product [[design knowledge]]. The APDL model addresses some weak [[Design pattern|patterns]] experienced in previous development models regarding quality of the design, [[requirements management]], [[change management]], [[project management]], and communication between [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]]. Practicing APDL may reduce development time and [[Project cost management|project cost]].

== Overview ==
APDL adds the Test [[Problem domain|domain]] and four new characteristics to Axiomatic design (AD): Input Constraints in the Functional Domain; Systems Components in the Physical Domain; Process Variables tied to System Components instead of Design Parameters; and Customer Needs mapped to Functional Requirements and Input Constraints.

APDL proposes a V-shaped process to develop the Design Parameters and System Components (detailed design). Start top-down with Process Variables (PV) and Component Test Cases (CTC) to complete the PV, CTC, and Functional Test Cases (FTC); And after build, test the product with a bottom-up approach.

== APDL Domains ==
;Customer domain
[[Voice of the customer|Customer Needs]] (CN) are elements that the customer seeks in a product or system.

;Functional domain
[[Functional requirement|Functional Requirements]] (FR) completely characterize the minimum performance to be met by the design solution, product etc. FR are documented in requirement specifications (RS).

Input [[Constraint (mathematics)|Constraints]] (IC) are included in the functional domain along with the FR. IC are specific to overall design goals and are imposed externally by CN, product users or conditions of use, such as regulations. IC are derived from CN and then revised based on other constraints that the product has to comply with but not mentioned in the Customer Domain.

;Physical domain
The Design Parameters (DP) are the elements of the design solution in the physical domain that are chosen to satisfy the specified FRs. DPs can be conceptual design solutions, subsystems, components, or component attributes.

System Components (SC) provide a categorical design solution in the DP, where the categories represent physical parts in the Physical Domain.  The SC hierarchy represents the physical [[system architecture]] or product tree. The method for categorizing varies. [[Steven D. Eppinger|Eppinger]] portrays general categories as system, subsystem, and component Eppinger (2001). NASA  uses system, segment, element, subsystem, assembly, subassembly, and part (NASA, 1995).

SC makes it possible to perform [[Design structure matrix|Design Structure Matrixes]] (DSM), change management, component-based cost management and impact analysis, and provides framework for capturing structural information and requirement traceability.

;Process domain
[[Process variable|Process Variables]] (PV) identify and describe the controls and processes to produce SC.

;Test domain
A functional test consists of a set of Functional Test Cases (FTC). FTC are [[System testing|system tests]] used to verify that FR are satisfied by the system. [[Black-box testing]] is the software analog to FTC. At the end of the system development, a functional test verifies that the requirements of the system are met.

Component Test Cases (CTC) are a physical analog to [[White-box testing]]. CTC verify that components satisfy the allocated FRs and ICs. Each system component is tested before it is integrated into the system to make sure that the requirements and constraints allocated to that component are all satisfied.

'''‘Camera Eats First’''' is the behavior and global phenomenon of people taking photos of their meals with digital or smartphone cameras before they eat, mostly followed by uploading the photos to the [[social media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theinkslingerstulc.weebly.com/features/3-reasons-you-should-take-food-picture-before-eat|title=Take Food Picture Before Eating Becomes a Trend|last=Lee|first=Jie Yin|date=1 October 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers to how people feed their cameras first by taking photos of their food before feeding themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skypost.hk/%E6%B8%AF%E8%81%9E/%E5%9F%8E%E5%B8%82%E7%86%B1%E8%A9%B1/20150714/001/%E9%A3%AF%E8%81%9A%E7%9B%B8%E6%A9%9F%E9%A3%9F%E5%85%88%20%E6%9C%8B%E5%8F%8B%E9%A4%93%E5%A3%9E%E7%84%A1%E7%99%AE/184195|title=飯聚相機食先 朋友餓壞無癮 心理學家:藉分享動態 獲取關注|last=|first=|date=14 July 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from professional [[food photography]] while the behavior of the ‘Camera Eats First’  is generally for personal use such as keeping photographic food diaries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/dining/07camera.html|title=First Camera, Then Fork|last=Murphy|first=Kate|date=6 April 2010|website=|publisher=|access-date=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of commercial purposes.

== Background ==
[[File:Camera eat first 1.jpg|thumb|Food photos posted by users from Instagram]]
[[File:Camera eats first 2.jpg|thumb|Food photos posted by users from instagram]]One reason for the rise of ‘Camera Eats First’ is the rise of digital convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dcfever.com/column/read.php?id=3101|title=相機食先—簡易食物拍法|last=Chan|first=Ivan|date=1 May 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The global participation in social media is on continual surge with the advancement in technology and commonness of digital devices that serve as mediums for social media. The veteran food photographer of [[The New York Times]], [[The Wall Street Journal]] and [[Saveur]] magazine Dave Hagerman mentioned that [[Instagram]], contains the most examples of ‘Camera Eats First’ photos. This platform provides a way for people to share and indulge in their common obsession of food globally, thus encouraging taking pictures of food for personal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/kuala-lumpur/restaurants/camera-eats-first-is-instagram-changing-the-way-we-eat|title=Camera eats first: Is Instagram changing the way we eat?|last=Koh|first=Joyce|date=22 December 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, keeping a photogenic food diary is being treated as a form of self representation, showing who they are from what they eat in accordance to the quote of “Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are,” by the French philosopher and gourmand [[Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin]], 1825.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/dining/07camera.html?_r=1|title=First Camera, Then Fork|last=Murphy|first=Kate|date=6 April 2010|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
[[File:Camera Eats First 3.jpg|thumb|A post about food using "#foodie" on Twitter]]
The 'Camera Eats First' phenomenon is becoming more common all over the world with the emergence of smartphone and social media. After taking photos of their food, people will usually share the photos on social media such as [https://www.instagram.com/wingthefoodie/ Instagram], [https://www.ecpi.edu/blog/16-facebook-pages-every-culinary-arts-food-lover-should-follow Facebook], [https://www.ecpi.edu/blog/16-facebook-pages-every-culinary-arts-food-lover-should-follow Twitter] and [https://www.pinterest.com/categories/food_drink/ Pinterest]. According to [https://web.stagram.com/?locale=en Webstagram], there are more than 180 million photos with the hashtag #food currently on Instagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://websta.me/hot|title=TOP 100 TAGS|last=|first=|date=|website=WEBSTA|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other hashtags such as [[Food porn|#foodporn]] and [[foodie|#foodie]] are often added to these photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hashtags.org/featured/5-top-food-hashtags-and-why-they-work/|title=5 Top Food Hashtags and Why They Work.|last=|first=|date=9 July 2013|website=Hashtag.org|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 90 new photos hash-tagged #foodporn are uploaded to Instagram every minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.menulog.com.au/blog/social-media-changing-eat/|title=How Social Media Is Changing The Way We Eat|last=|first=|date=3 September 2014|website=Menulog|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon is especially more prevalent among the younger generation. According to a survey done by [[News Corp Australia|News Limited]], “54 per cent of 18-24 year olds have taken a photo of their food while eating out, while 39 per cent have posted it somewhere online. This compares with only 5 per cent of over-50s who say they share food snaps on forums such as Facebook and Twitter.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/food/aussies-share-the-food-love-by-posting-pictures-of-meals-on-social-media/story-fneuz8wn-1226637885462|title=Aussies share the food love by posting pictures of meals on social media|last=Wilkinson|first=Simon|date=9 May 2013|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positive Effects ==

=== Increased connection and satisfying psychological needs ===
Through sharing food photos on social media, users can form connections with other people and strengthen interpersonal bonds. Food is always a community event and a bonding experience which can bridge the gap between people and share joy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/culture/what-does-instagramming-our-food-say-about-modern-eaters.html|title=What does Instagramming our food say about modern eaters?|last=Heimbuch|first=Jaymi|date=6 June 2013|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, sharing food photos also acts as a  "social glue"  to gather people together to participate in each other's eating experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greatist.com/happiness/social-media-food-050813|title=How Social Media Changes The Way We Think About Food|last=Lebowitz|first=Shana|date=8 May 2013|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the sharing, a private dining experience is turned into a communal bonding activity. People can communicate and share their emotions with others, for example, happiness in a party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austin360.com/news/lifestyles/food-cooking/austin360eats-how-instagram-social-media-food-phot/nc9xy/|title=How Instagram, social media food photography have changed how we eat|last=Broyles|first=Addie|date=6 February 2014|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, people can satisfy the psychological needs of “belongingness and love” and “esteem” according to the [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://snipandsharemonkey.tumblr.com/post/129781442196/camera-eats-first|title=CAMERA EATS FIRST|last=Lai|first=Justin|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they can share their experiences and show off to the world what they are eating.

=== Business opportunities ===
Sharing food photos can facilitate people’s obsession with food, but it can also help promote restaurants. Sharing of food photo can be a visual pull that will subconsciously alert people to check out new restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/kuala-lumpur/restaurants/camera-eats-first-is-instagram-changing-the-way-we-eat|title=Camera eats first: Is Instagram changing the way we eat?|last=Koh|first=Joyce|date=22 December 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carmel Winery]], a restaurant in Israel, gained $400,000 from free promotion by food photos on social media and successfully boosted its sales by 13% owing to the help of “Camera Eats First”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theforkmanager.com/blog/add-instagram-to-your-restaurants-marketing-strategy-and-entice-your-customers/|title=Add Instagram to Your Restaurant’s Marketing Strategy And Entice Your Customers!|last=|first=|date=7 December 2015|website=Thefork Manager A Company Tripadvisor.|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some chefs in Hong Kong would take "food porn" photos and post them on social media because they thought that the "Camera Eats First" phenomenon served as a channel for them to collect feedback from customers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/food-wine/article/1441916/taking-food-porn-photos-hong-kong-so-popular-even-chefs-are|title=Taking 'food porn' photos in Hong Kong is so popular even the chefs are doing it|first=Mischa|publisher=|last1=Moselle|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a vital information for them to make improvements to their dishes.

=== Making food taste better ===
According to a study mentioned on Bit of News,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bitofnews.com/instagramming-your-food-actually-makes-it-taste-better-study-says/|title=Instagramming your food actually makes it taste better, study says|last=Xiao|first=Xu|date=13 March 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking photos of pleasurable food, such as cakes, before eating it can increase the savoring — "the increased anticipation built up from taking photos of the food made it taste better." If people don't take a photo, they may even feel something is missing from the savoring experience.

== Negative Effects ==

=== Infringement of chefs' intellectual property ===
The 'Camera Eats First' behavior was banned in some French restaurants, as diners may infringe upon chefs' [[intellectual property]]. Some French chefs criticized that this behavior would ruin the surprise of future diners, as they might have seen the photos of dishes shared on the internet before coming to the restaurant. Diners posting the photos on social media may give rise to intellectual property disputes about other chefs copying the ideas and presentation of the plates, which are the creative elements contributed by the original chefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2560940/Stop-taking-food-snaps-plead-chefs-French-restaurant-bans-cameras-head-cook-complained-diners-taking-pictures-meals.html|title=Stop taking food snaps, plead chefs: French restaurant bans cameras after head cook complained about diners taking pictures of their meals|first=Louise|publisher=|last1=Eccles|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impoliteness and worsening relationships ===
The "Camera Eats First" behavior may be considered as an impolite table manner. When diners photograph the food, they may place too much emphasis on the appearance of the food and try to capture the food at its best angle by rearranging tables. It may disrupt other people dining and spoil the enjoyment of their meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2560940/Stop-taking-food-snaps-plead-chefs-French-restaurant-bans-cameras-head-cook-complained-diners-taking-pictures-meals.html|title=Stop taking food snaps, plead chefs: French restaurant bans cameras after head cook complained about diners taking pictures of their meals|last=Eccles|first=Louise|date=17 February 2014|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also leave their partners in a state of hunger and impatience. 

On the other hand, while people are busy photographing their food and sharing it online, they will have less time to communicate with their friends and family. One of the functions of [[eating]]—enabling families and friends to gather together and enhance intimacy—is lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/culture/what-does-instagramming-our-food-say-about-modern-eaters.html|title=What does Instagramming our food say about modern eaters?|last=Heimbuch|first=Jaymi|date=6 June 2013|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'Camera Eats First" behavior may result in worsening relationships and weakening connection with others in contrast with the positive effect mentioned.

Causeless cause is synonymous with '[[Absolute (philosophy)|the absolute]],' which '[[Logos|Proto-logos]]' is often confused with, but it is not: 'first' denotes finite bound, but causeless cause is unbounded.

It has been shown the causeless cause is so described in some religious cosmogenesis accounts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18858">In [[computer science]], '''divide and conquer''' is an [[algorithm design paradigm]] based on multi-branched [[recursion]]. A divide and conquer [[algorithm]] works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.

This divide and conquer technique is the basis of efficient algorithms for all kinds of problems, such as [[sorting algorithm|sorting]] (e.g., [[quicksort]], [[merge sort]]), [[multiplication algorithm|multiplying large numbers]] (e.g. the [[Karatsuba algorithm]]), finding the [[Closest pair of points problem|closest pair of points]], [[syntactic analysis]] (e.g., [[top-down parser]]s), and computing the [[discrete Fourier transform]] ([[fast Fourier transform|FFT]]s) {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.

Understanding and designing divide and conquer algorithms is a complex skill that requires a good understanding of the nature of the underlying problem to be solved. As when proving a [[theorem]] by [[Mathematical induction|induction]], it is often necessary to replace the original problem with a more general or complicated problem in order to initialize the recursion, and there is no systematic method for finding the proper generalization{{Clarify|date=October 2017}}. These divide and conquer complications are seen when optimizing the calculation of a [[Fibonacci_number#Matrix form|Fibonacci number with efficient double recursion]] {{Why|date=October 2017}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.

The correctness of a divide and conquer algorithm is usually proved by [[mathematical induction]], and its computational cost is often determined by solving [[recurrence relation]]s.

== Divide and conquer ==
[[File:Merge sort algorithm diagram.svg|thumb|Divide-and-conquer approach to sort the list (38,27,43,3,9,82,10) in increasing order. ''Upper half:'' splitting into sublists; ''mid:'' a one-element list is trivially sorted; ''lower half:'' composing sorted sublists.]] 
The divide and conquer paradigm is often used to find the optimal solution of a problem. Its basic idea is to decompose a given problem into two or more similar, but simpler, subproblems, to solve them in turn, and to compose their solutions to solve the given problem. Problems of sufficient simplicity are solved directly. 
For example, to sort a given list of ''n'' natural numbers, split it into two lists of about ''n''/2 numbers each, sort each of them in turn, and interleave both results appropriately to obtain the sorted version of the given list (cf. picture). This approach is known as the [[merge sort]] algorithm.

The name "divide and conquer" is sometimes applied to algorithms that reduce each problem to only one sub-problem, such as the [[binary search]] algorithm for finding a record in a sorted list (or its analog in [[numerical algorithm|numerical computing]], the [[bisection algorithm]] for [[root-finding algorithm|root finding]]).&lt;ref name=CLR&gt;Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, and Ronald L. Rivest, ''Introduction to Algorithms'' (MIT Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;  These algorithms can be implemented more efficiently than general divide-and-conquer algorithms; in particular, if they use [[tail recursion]], they can be converted into simple [[loop (computing)|loop]]s.  Under this broad definition, however, every algorithm that uses recursion or loops could be regarded as a "divide and conquer algorithm".  Therefore, some authors consider that the name "divide and conquer" should be used only when each problem may generate two or more subproblems.&lt;ref&gt;Brassard, G. and Bratley, P. Fundamental of Algorithmics, Prentice-Hall, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The name '''decrease and conquer''' has been proposed instead for the single-subproblem class.&lt;ref&gt;Anany V. Levitin, ''Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms'' (Addison Wesley, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

An important application of divide and conquer is in optimization{{Examples|date=October 2017}}, where if the search space is reduced ("pruned") by a constant factor at each step, the overall algorithm has the same asymptotic complexity as the pruning step, with the constant depending on the pruning factor (by summing the [[geometric series]]); this is known as [[prune and search]].

== Early historical examples ==
Early examples of these algorithms are primarily decrease and conquer – the original problem is successively broken down into ''single'' subproblems, and indeed can be solved iteratively.

Binary search, a decrease and conquer algorithm where the subproblems are of roughly half the original size, has a long history. While a clear description of the algorithm on computers appeared in 1946 in an article by [[John Mauchly]], the idea of using a sorted list of items to facilitate searching dates back at least as far as [[Babylonia]] in 200&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=Knuth3/&gt; Another ancient decrease and conquer algorithm is the [[Euclidean algorithm]] to compute the [[greatest common divisor]] of two numbers by reducing the numbers to smaller and smaller equivalent subproblems, which dates to several centuries BC.

An early example of a divide-and-conquer algorithm with multiple subproblems is [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]'s 1805 description of what is now called the [[Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm|Cooley–Tukey fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) algorithm,&lt;ref name=Heideman84&gt;Heideman, M. T., D. H. Johnson, and C. S. Burrus, "Gauss and the history of the fast Fourier transform," IEEE ASSP Magazine, 1, (4), 14–21 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; although he did not [[analysis of algorithms|analyze its operation count]] quantitatively and FFTs did not become widespread until they were rediscovered over a century later.

An early two-subproblem D&amp;C algorithm that was specifically developed for computers and properly analyzed is the [[merge sort]] algorithm, invented by [[John von Neumann]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last=Knuth | first=Donald | authorlink=Donald Knuth | year=1998 | title=[[The Art of Computer Programming]]: Volume 3 Sorting and Searching | page=159 | isbn=0-201-89685-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable example is the [[Karatsuba algorithm|algorithm]] invented by [[Anatolii Alexeevitch Karatsuba|Anatolii A. Karatsuba]] in 1960&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Karatsuba | first=Anatolii A. | authorlink=Anatolii Alexeevitch Karatsuba |author2=Yuri P. Ofman |authorlink2=Yuri Petrovich Ofman  | year=1962 | title=Умножение многозначных чисел на автоматах | journal=[[Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR]] | volume=146 | pages=293–294}} Translated in {{cite journal| title=Multiplication of Multidigit Numbers on Automata | journal=Physics-Doklady | volume=7 | year=1963 | pages=595–596 |url={{Google books|MrkOAAAAIAAJ|plainurl=true}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; that could multiply two ''n''-digit numbers in &lt;math&gt;O(n^{\log_2 3})&lt;/math&gt; operations (in [[Big O notation]]). This algorithm disproved [[Andrey Kolmogorov]]'s 1956 conjecture that &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; operations would be required for that task.

As another example of a divide and conquer algorithm that did not originally involve computers, [[Donald Knuth]] gives the method a [[post office]] typically uses to route mail: letters are sorted into separate bags for different geographical areas, each of these bags is itself sorted into batches for smaller sub-regions, and so on until they are delivered.&lt;ref name=Knuth3&gt;Donald E. Knuth, ''The Art of Computer Programming: Volume 3, Sorting and Searching'', second edition (Addison-Wesley, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to a [[radix sort]], described for [[IBM 80 series Card Sorters|punch-card sorting]] machines as early as 1929.&lt;ref name=Knuth3/&gt;

== Advantages ==

=== Solving difficult problems ===
Divide and conquer is a powerful tool for solving conceptually difficult problems: all it requires is a way of breaking the problem into sub-problems, of solving the trivial cases and of combining sub-problems to the original problem. Similarly, decrease and conquer only requires reducing the problem to a single smaller problem, such as the classic [[Tower of Hanoi]] puzzle, which reduces moving a tower of height ''n'' to moving a tower of height ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1.

=== Algorithm efficiency ===
The divide-and-conquer paradigm often helps in the discovery of efficient algorithms.  It was the key, for example, to Karatsuba's fast multiplication method, the quicksort and mergesort algorithms, the [[Strassen algorithm]] for matrix multiplication, and fast Fourier transforms.

In all these examples, the D&amp;C approach led to an improvement in the [[asymptotic complexity|asymptotic cost]] of the solution.
For example, if (a) the [[Recursion (computer science)|base cases]] have constant-bounded size, the work of splitting the problem and combining the partial solutions is proportional to the problem's size ''n'', and (b) there is a bounded number ''p'' of subproblems of size ~ ''n''/''p'' at each stage, then the cost of the divide-and-conquer algorithm will be O(''n'' log&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''n'').

=== Parallelism ===
Divide and conquer algorithms are naturally adapted for execution in multi-processor machines, especially shared-memory systems where the communication of data between processors does not need to be planned in advance, because distinct sub-problems can be executed on different processors.

=== Memory access ===
Divide-and-conquer algorithms naturally tend to make efficient use of [[memory cache]]s. The reason is that once a sub-problem is small enough, it and all its sub-problems can, in principle, be solved within the cache, without accessing the slower main memory. An algorithm designed to exploit the cache in this way is called ''[[cache-oblivious algorithm|cache-oblivious]]'', because it does not contain the cache size as an explicit parameter.&lt;ref name="cahob"&gt;{{cite journal | author = M. Frigo |author2=C. E. Leiserson|author3=H. Prokop | title = Cache-oblivious algorithms | journal = Proc. 40th Symp. on the Foundations of Computer Science | year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover, D&amp;C algorithms can be designed for important algorithms (e.g., sorting, FFTs, and matrix multiplication) to be ''optimal'' cache-oblivious algorithms–they use the cache in a probably optimal way, in an asymptotic sense, regardless of the cache size. In contrast, the traditional approach to exploiting the cache is ''blocking'', as in [[loop nest optimization]], where the problem is explicitly divided into chunks of the appropriate size—this can also use the cache optimally, but only when the algorithm is tuned for the specific cache size(s) of a particular machine.

The same advantage exists with regards to other hierarchical storage systems, such as [[Non-Uniform Memory Access|NUMA]] or [[virtual memory]], as well as for multiple levels of cache: once a sub-problem is small enough, it can be solved within a given level of the hierarchy, without accessing the higher (slower) levels.

=== Roundoff control ===
In computations with rounded arithmetic, e.g. with [[floating point]] numbers, a divide-and-conquer algorithm may yield more accurate results than a superficially equivalent iterative method. For example, one can add ''N'' numbers either by a simple loop that adds each datum to a single variable, or by a D&amp;C algorithm called [[pairwise summation]] that breaks the data set into two halves, recursively computes the sum of each half, and then adds the two sums.  While the second method performs the same number of additions as the first, and pays the overhead of the recursive calls, it is usually more accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas J. Higham, "The accuracy of floating point summation", ''SIAM J. Scientific Computing'' '''14''' (4), 783–799 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation issues ==

=== Recursion ===
Divide-and-conquer algorithms are naturally implemented as [[Recursion_(computer_science)|recursive procedures]]. In that case, the partial sub-problems leading to the one currently being solved are automatically stored in the [[call stack|procedure call stack]]. A recursive function is a function that calls itself within its definition.

=== Explicit stack ===
Divide and conquer algorithms can also be implemented by a non-recursive program that stores the partial sub-problems in some explicit data structure, such as a [[stack (data structure)|stack]], [[queue (data structure)|queue]], or [[priority queue]].  This approach allows more freedom in the choice of the sub-problem that is to be solved next, a feature that is important in some applications — e.g. in [[breadth first recursion|breadth-first recursion]] and the [[branch and bound]] method for function optimization.  This approach is also the standard solution in programming languages that do not provide support for recursive procedures.

=== Stack size ===
In recursive implementations of D&amp;C algorithms, one must make sure that there is sufficient memory allocated for the recursion stack, otherwise the execution may fail because of [[stack overflow]].  D&amp;C algorithms that are time-efficient often have relatively small recursion depth.  For example, the quicksort algorithm can be implemented so that it never requires more than &lt;math&gt;\log_2 n&lt;/math&gt; nested recursive calls to  sort &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; items.

Stack overflow may be difficult to avoid when using recursive procedures, since many compilers assume that the recursion stack is a contiguous area of memory, and some allocate a fixed amount of space for it.  Compilers may also save more information in the recursion stack than is strictly necessary, such as return address, unchanging parameters, and the internal variables of the procedure.  Thus, the risk of stack overflow can be reduced by minimizing the parameters and internal variables of the recursive procedure, or by using an explicit stack structure.

=== Choosing the base cases ===

In any recursive algorithm, there is considerable freedom in the choice of the ''base cases'', the small subproblems that are solved directly in order to terminate the recursion.

Choosing the smallest or simplest possible base cases is more elegant and usually leads to simpler programs, because there are fewer cases to consider and they are easier to solve.  For example, an FFT algorithm could stop the recursion when the input is a single sample, and the quicksort list-sorting algorithm could stop when the input is the empty list; in both examples there is only one base case to consider, and it requires no processing.

On the other hand, efficiency often improves if the recursion is stopped at relatively large base cases, and these are solved non-recursively, resulting in a [[hybrid algorithm]]. This strategy avoids the overhead of recursive calls that do little or no work, and may also allow the use of specialized non-recursive algorithms that, for those base cases, are more efficient than explicit recursion. A general procedure for a simple hybrid recursive algorithm is ''short-circuiting the base case,'' also known as ''[[arm's-length recursion]].'' In this case whether the next step will result in the base case is checked before the function call, avoiding an unnecessary function call. For example, in a tree, rather than recursing to a child node and then checking if it is null, checking null before recursing; this avoids half the function calls in some algorithms on binary trees. Since a D&amp;C algorithm eventually reduces each problem or sub-problem instance to a large number of base instances, these often dominate the overall cost of the algorithm, especially when the splitting/joining overhead is low. Note that these considerations do not depend on whether recursion is implemented by the compiler or by an explicit stack.

Thus, for example, many library implementations of quicksort will switch to a simple loop-based [[insertion sort]] (or similar) algorithm once the number of items to be sorted is sufficiently small.  Note that, if the empty list were the only base case, sorting a list with ''n'' entries would entail maximally ''n'' quicksort calls that would do nothing but return immediately.  Increasing the base cases to lists of size 2 or less will eliminate most of those do-nothing calls, and more generally a base case larger than 2 is typically used to reduce the fraction of time spent in function-call overhead or stack manipulation.

Alternatively, one can employ large base cases that still use a divide-and-conquer algorithm, but implement the algorithm for predetermined set of fixed sizes where the algorithm can be completely [[loop unwinding|unrolled]] into code that has no recursion, loops, or [[Conditional (programming)|conditionals]] (related to the technique of [[partial evaluation]]).  For example, this approach is used in some efficient FFT implementations, where the base cases are unrolled implementations of divide-and-conquer FFT algorithms for a set of fixed sizes.&lt;ref name="fftw"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Frigo, M. |author2=Johnson, S. G. | url = http://www.fftw.org/fftw-paper-ieee.pdf | title = The design and implementation of FFTW3 | journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 93 | issue = 2 |date=February 2005 | pages = 216–231 | doi = 10.1109/JPROC.2004.840301}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Source code generation]] methods may be used to produce the large number of separate base cases desirable to implement this strategy efficiently.&lt;ref name="fftw"/&gt;

The generalized version of this idea is known as recursion "unrolling" or "coarsening" and various techniques have been proposed for automating the procedure of enlarging the base case.&lt;ref&gt;Radu Rugina and Martin Rinard, "[http://people.csail.mit.edu/rinard/paper/lcpc00.pdf Recursion unrolling for divide and conquer programs]," in ''Languages and Compilers for Parallel Computing'', chapter 3, pp. 34–48.  ''Lecture Notes in Computer Science'' vol. 2017 (Berlin: Springer, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sharing repeated subproblems ===
For some problems,  the branched recursion may end up evaluating the same sub-problem many times over.  In such cases it may be worth identifying and saving the solutions to these overlapping subproblems, a technique commonly known as [[memoization]].  Followed to the limit, it leads to [[bottom-up design|bottom-up]] divide-and-conquer algorithms such as [[dynamic programming]] and [[chart parsing]].

'''Edmund Emil Kemper III''' (born December 18, 1948) is an American [[serial killer]] who murdered ten people, including his [[familicide|paternal grandparents]] and [[matricide|mother]]. He regularly engaged in [[necrophilia]]. He is noted for his large size, at {{convert|6|ft|9|in|m}}, and for his [[Genius|genius]] level [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] of 145.

Born in California, Kemper had a disturbed childhood. He moved to Montana with his abusive mother at a young age before returning to California, where he murdered his paternal grandparents when he was 15. He was diagnosed as a [[paranoid schizophrenic]] by court psychiatrists and sentenced to the [[Atascadero State Hospital]] as a criminally insane juvenile.

Released at the age of 21 after convincing psychiatrists he was rehabilitated, Kemper was regarded as non-threatening by his victims. He targeted young female [[hitchhiking|hitchhikers]] during his killing spree, luring them into his vehicle and driving them to secluded areas where he would murder them before taking their corpses back to his home to be decapitated, dismembered and violated. Kemper then murdered his mother and one of her friends before turning himself in to the authorities.

Found sane and guilty at his trial in 1973, he requested the [[death penalty]] for his crimes. However, [[Capital punishment in California#1972 suspension of capital punishment|capital punishment was suspended in California]] at the time, and he instead received eight [[life sentence]]s. Since then, Kemper has been incarcerated in the [[California Medical Facility]]. He has waived his right to a [[parole]] hearing several times and has said he is "happy" in prison.

==Early life==
Edmund Emil Kemper III was born in [[Burbank, California]] on December 18, 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Genealogy of the Kemper Family in the United States|first1=Virginia Mary|last1=McComb|first2=Willis M.|last2=Kemper|publisher=G.K. Hazlett &amp; Company, Printers|date=1999|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the middle child and only son born to Clarnell Elizabeth Kemper (née Stage, 1921–1973) and Edmund Emil Kemper II (1919–1985).&lt;ref name="coed"&gt;{{cite web|title=Time Bomb |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/edmund_1.html |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215090425/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/edmund_1.html |archivedate=February 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/kemper.html|title=Ancestry of Edmund Emil Kemper III|publisher=''William Addams Reitwiesner Genealogical Services''}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Edmund II was a World War II veteran who, after the war, tested [[nuclear weapon]]s in the [[Pacific Proving Grounds]] before returning to California, where he worked as an electrician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwii-army.mooseroots.com/l/94887/Edmund-E-Kemper|title=Edmund Emil Kemper: WWII Enlistment Record|publisher=''MooseRoots''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brottman"&gt;{{cite book|first=Mikita|last=Brottman|title=Car Crash Culture|pages=106–107|year=2002|isbn=0-312-24038-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarnell often complained about Edmund II's "menial" electrician job,&lt;ref name="brottman"/&gt; and he later said "suicide missions in wartime and the atomic bomb testings were nothing compared to living with her" and that Clarnell affected him "more than three hundred and ninety-six days and nights of fighting on the front did."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cheney|1976|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weighing {{convert|13|lb|kg|1}} as a newborn, Kemper was already a head taller than his peers by the age of four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ingrid|last=Pitt|title=Murder, Torture &amp; Depravity|p=67|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7134-8676-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also intelligent but exhibited behavior such as [[zoosadism|cruelty to animals]]: at the age of 10, he buried a pet cat alive; once it died, he dug it up, decapitated it and mounted its head on a spike.&lt;ref name="crimefiles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/crime-files/edmund-kemper/|title=Edmund Kemper|publisher=[[Crime &amp; Investigation Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Helen|last=Gavin|title=Criminological and Forensic Psychology|page=120|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kemper later stated that he derived pleasure from successfully lying to his family about killing the cat.&lt;ref name="coed7"/&gt; At the age of 13, he killed another family cat when he perceived it to be favoring his younger sister, Allyn Lee Kemper (born 1951), over him, and kept pieces of it in his closet until his mother found them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Frank|last1=Ascoine|first2=Randall|last2=Lockwood|date=1998|title=Cruelty to Animals and Interpersonal Violence: Readings in Research and Application|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=978-1-55753-106-3|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martingale|1995|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kemper had a dark [[Fantasy (psychology)#In schizophrenia|fantasy]] life: he performed rituals with his younger sister's dolls that culminated in him removing their heads and hands,&lt;ref name="vronsky259"&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, on one occasion, when his elder sister, Susan Hughey Kemper (1943–2014), teased him and asked why he did not try to kiss his teacher, he replied: "If I kiss her, I'd have to kill her first."&lt;ref name="coed7"/&gt; He also recalled that as a young boy he would sneak out of his house and, armed with his father's [[bayonet]], go to his second-grade teacher's house to watch her through the windows.&lt;ref name="vronsky259"/&gt; He stated in later interviews that some of his favorite games to play as a child were "Gas Chamber" and "Electric Chair", in which he asked his younger sister to tie him up, flip an imaginary switch and then he would tumble over and writhe on the floor, pretending to be dying of gas inhalation or electric shock.&lt;ref name="vronsky259"/&gt; He also had [[near-death experience]]s as a child, once when his elder sister tried to push him in front of a train, and another when she successfully pushed him into the deep end of a swimming pool, where he almost drowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lawson|2002|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kemper had a close relationship with his father and was devastated when his parents separated in 1957, causing him to be raised by Clarnell in [[Helena, Montana]]. He had a severely dysfunctional relationship with his mother: a [[Neuroticism|neurotic]], domineering [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] who would frequently belittle, humiliate and abuse him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=James|last=Sias|title=The Meaning of Evil|p=31|year=2016|isbn=978-1-137-56822-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarnell often made her son sleep in a locked basement because she feared that he would harm his sisters,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lawson|2002|pp=129–131, 136}}&lt;/ref&gt; regularly mocked him for his large size—he stood at {{convert|6|ft|4|in|m}} by the age of 15&lt;ref name="coed"/&gt;—and derided him as "a real weirdo."&lt;ref name="vronsky259"/&gt; She also refused to coddle him for fear that she would "turn him gay,"&lt;ref name="brottman"/&gt; and told the young Kemper that he reminded her of his father and that no woman would ever love him.&lt;ref name="crimefiles"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vronsky258"&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kemper later described her as a "sick angry woman,"&lt;ref name="larson"/&gt; and it has been postulated that she suffered from [[borderline personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lawson|2002|pp=129–131, 136, 139, 141, 144, 278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 15, Kemper ran away from home in an attempt to reconcile with his father in [[Van Nuys]], California.&lt;ref name="coed7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/sara_7.html |title=Creating a Killer |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210031710/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/sara_7.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once there, he learned that his father had remarried and had a stepson. Kemper stayed with his father for a short while until the elder Kemper sent him to live with his paternal grandparents, who lived on a ranch in the mountains of [[North Fork, California|North Fork]].&lt;ref name="coed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biography.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=A&amp;E Television Networks|title=Edmund Kemper Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/edmund-kemper-403254|publisher=[[Biography (TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kemper hated living in North Fork; he described his grandfather as "senile," and said that his  grandmother "was constantly emasculating me and my grandfather."&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite news|last=von Beroldingen|first=Marj|title="I Was the Hunter and They Were the Victims": Interview with Edmund Kemper|url=http://www.truecrime.net/kemper/interview.htm|newspaper=Front Page Detective Magazine|date=March 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First murders==
On August 27, 1964, Kemper's grandmother, Maude Matilda Hughey Kemper (1897–1964), was sitting at the kitchen table when she and Kemper had an argument. Enraged by the argument, Kemper stormed off and grabbed a rifle that his grandfather had given him for hunting. He then returned to the kitchen and fatally shot his grandmother in the head before firing twice more into her back.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cheney|1976|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some accounts mention that she also suffered multiple post-mortem stab wounds with a kitchen knife.&lt;ref name="frasier"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frasier|first=David K.|title=Murder Cases of the Twentieth Century: Biographies of 280 Convicted or Accused Killers|year=2007|isbn=0-7864-3031-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lunde"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lunde|first=Donald T.|title=Murder and Madness|year=1976|isbn=0-913374-33-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kemper's grandfather, Edmund Emil Kemper (1892–1964), came home from grocery shopping, Kemper went outside and fatally shot him in the driveway.&lt;ref name="Biography.com"/&gt; He was unsure of what to do next and so phoned his mother, who urged him to contact the local police. Kemper then called the police and waited for them to take him into custody.&lt;ref name="coed2"/&gt;

When questioned by authorities, Kemper said that he "just wanted to see what it felt like to kill Grandma," and that he killed his grandfather so that he would not have to find out that his wife was dead.&lt;ref name="crimefiles"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coed2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/childhood_2.html |title=Incomprehensible |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215084914/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/childhood_2.html |archivedate=February 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychiatry|Psychiatrist]] Donald Lunde, who interviewed Kemper at length during adulthood, wrote that with these murders, "In his way, [Kemper] had avenged the rejection of both his father and his mother."&lt;ref name="coed"/&gt; Kemper's crimes were deemed incomprehensible for a 15-year-old to commit, and court psychiatrists diagnosed him as a [[paranoid schizophrenic]] before sending him to the criminally insane unit of the [[Atascadero State Hospital]].&lt;ref name="vronsky260"&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imprisonment===
At Atascadero, [[California Youth Authority]] psychiatrists and [[social worker]]s strongly disagreed with the court psychiatrists' diagnosis. Their reports stated that Kemper showed "no flight of ideas, no interference with thought, no expression of delusions or hallucinations, and no evidence of bizarre thinking,"&lt;ref name="vronsky260"/&gt; and recorded that he had an [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] of 136.&lt;ref name="coed2"/&gt; He was re-diagnosed and stated as having a "[[Passive–aggressive personality disorder|personality trait disturbance, passive-aggressive type]]."&lt;ref name="vronsky260"/&gt; Later on in his time at Atascadero, Kemper tested higher at an IQ of 145.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I1Nvvccs7TYC&amp;pg=PA544&amp;dq=edmund+kemper+iq#v=onepage&amp;q=edmund%20kemper%20iq|title=Lethal Intent |page=511|author=Sue Russell|year=2002|isbn=978-0-7860-1518-4|publisher=Pinnacle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cheney|1976|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kemper endeared himself to his psychiatrists by being a model prisoner, and was trained to administer psychiatric tests to other inmates.&lt;ref name="coed2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vronsky260"/&gt; One of his psychiatrists later stated: "He was a very good worker and this is not typical of a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]]. He really took pride in his work."&lt;ref name="vronsky260"/&gt; Kemper also became a member of the [[United States Junior Chamber|Jaycees]] while in Atascadero and stated that he developed "some new tests and some new scales on the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]]," specifically an "Overt Hostility Scale," during his work with Atascadero psychiatrists.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; After his second arrest, Kemper stated that being able to understand how these tests functioned allowed him to manipulate his psychiatrists, and admitted that he learned a lot from the [[sex offender]]s to whom he administered tests; for example, they told him it was best to kill a woman after raping her to avoid leaving witnesses.&lt;ref name="vronsky260"/&gt;

==Release and time between murders==

On December 18, 1969, his 21st birthday, Kemper was released on parole from Atascadero.&lt;ref name="frasier"/&gt; Against the recommendations of psychiatrists at the hospital,&lt;ref name="coed"/&gt; he was released into the care of Clarnell—who had remarried and taken the surname Strandberg, then divorced again—at 609 A Ord Street, [[Aptos, California|Aptos]], California, a short drive from where she worked as an administrative assistant at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref name="coed4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/crimes_4.html |title=The Beginning |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215090419/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/crimes_4.html |archivedate=February 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kemper later demonstrated further to his psychiatrists that he was rehabilitated, and on November 29, 1972, his juvenile records were permanently expunged.&lt;ref name="coed9"/&gt; The last report from his probation psychiatrists read:

{{quote|If I were to see this patient without having any history available or getting any history from him, I would think that we're dealing with a very well adjusted young man who had initiative, intelligence and who was free of any psychiatric illnesses&amp;nbsp;... It is my opinion that he has made a very excellent response to the years of treatment and rehabilitation and I would see no psychiatric reason to consider him to be of any danger to himself or to any member of society&amp;nbsp;... [and] since it may allow him more freedom as an adult to develop his potential, I would consider it reasonable to have a permanent expunction of his juvenile records.&lt;ref name="vronsky263"&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While staying with his mother, Kemper attended [[community college]] in accordance with his parole requirements and had hoped he would become a police officer, but was rejected because of his size—at the time of his release from Atascadero, Kemper stood {{convert|6|ft|9|in|m}} tall—which led to his nickname "Big Ed".&lt;ref name="coed4"/&gt; Kemper maintained relationships with Santa Cruz police officers despite his rejection to join the force and became a self-described "friendly nuisance"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ed Kemper Interview, 1984. 12m9s|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzQCih3QY6A&amp;t=12m9s}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a bar called the Jury Room, which was a popular hangout for local law enforcement officers.&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite web|title=Santa Cruz Serial Killer Spotlighted In TV Documentary|url=http://www.ksbw.com/Santa-Cruz-Serial-Killer-Spotlighted-In-TV-Documentary/4910038|first=Amy|last=Larson|publisher=[[KSBW]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked a series of menial jobs before securing employment with the State of California Highway Department (now known as the [[California Department of Transportation]]).&lt;ref name="coed4"/&gt; During this time, his relationship with Clarnell remained toxic and hostile, with mother and son having frequent arguments which their neighbors often overheard.&lt;ref name="coed4"/&gt; Kemper later described the arguments he had with his mother around this time, stating:

{{quote|My mother and I started right in on horrendous battles, just horrible battles, violent and vicious. I've never been in such a vicious verbal battle with anyone. It would go to fists with a man, but this was my mother and I couldn't stand the thought of my mother and I doing these things. She insisted on it, and just over stupid things. I remember one roof-raiser was over whether I should have my teeth cleaned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cheney|1976|pp=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When he had saved enough money, Kemper moved out to live with a friend in [[Alameda, California|Alameda]]. Here he still complained of being unable to get away from his mother, as she regularly phoned him and paid him surprise visits.&lt;ref name="vronsky261"&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often had financial difficulties, which resulted in him frequently returning to his mother's apartment in Aptos.&lt;ref name="coed4"/&gt;

The same year he began working for the Highway Department, Kemper began dating a 16-year-old [[Turlock High School]] student to whom he would later become [[engagement|engaged]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff writer(s)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/25123957/|newspaper=''[[Greeley Daily Tribune]]''|location=Greeley, Colorado|date=May 5, 1973|title=Page 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also during this year, he was hit by a car while riding a motorcycle that he had recently purchased. His arm was badly injured, and he received a $15,000 settlement in the civil suit he filed against the car's driver. While driving around in the 1969 [[Ford Galaxie]] he bought with his settlement money, he noticed a large number of young women [[hitchhiking]], and began storing plastic bags, knives, blankets, and handcuffs in his car. He then began picking up girls and peacefully letting them go—according to Kemper, he picked up around 150 hitchhikers, any of whom would have been suitable&lt;ref name="coed4"/&gt;—before he felt homicidal sexual urges, which he called his "little zapples,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Phil|last=Clarke|title=Extreme Evil: Taking Crime to the Next Level|isbn=978-0-7088-6695-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerritsen"&gt;{{cite book|first=Tess|last=Gerritsen|title=The Surgeon|isbn=978-0-7394-2041-6|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began acting on them.&lt;ref name="coed4"/&gt;

==Later murders==
Between May 1972 and April 1973, Kemper embarked on a murder spree that started with two college students and ended with the murders of his mother and her best friend. He would pick up female students who were hitchhiking and take them to isolated areas where he would shoot, stab, smother or strangle them. He would then take their lifeless bodies back to his home where he would [[decapitate]] them, perform [[irrumatio]] on their severed heads, [[Necrophilia|have sexual intercourse with their corpses]], and then [[dismemberment|dismember]] them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martingale|1995|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this 11-month spree, he killed five college students, one high school student, his mother and his mother's best friend. Kemper has stated in interviews that he would often go hunting for victims after his mother's outbursts towards him, and that she would not introduce him to women attending the university where she worked. He recalled: "She would say, 'You're just like your father.

On May 7, 1972, Kemper was driving in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] when he picked up two 18-year-old hitchhiking [[Fresno State University|Fresno State]] students, Mary Ann Pesce and Anita Mary Luchessa, on the pretext of taking them to [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name="stephens"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stephens|first=Hugh|title=I'll Show You Where I Buried the Pieces of Their Bodies|url=http://www.truecrime.net/kemper/article.htm|newspaper=Inside Detective|date=August 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; After driving for an hour, he managed to reach a secluded wooded area near [[Alameda, California|Alameda]], which he was familiar with from his work at the Highway Department, without alerting his passengers that he had changed directions from where they wanted to go.&lt;ref name="vronsky261"/&gt; Here he intended to rape them, but having learned from serial rapists in Atascadero to not leave witnesses, he instead handcuffed Pesce and locked Luchessa in the trunk, then stabbed and strangled Pesce to death before killing Luchessa in a similar manner.&lt;ref name="coed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coed8"/&gt; Kemper later confessed that while handcuffing Pesce he "brushed the back of [his] hand against one of her breasts and it embarrassed [him]" before adding that "[he] even said 'whoops, I'm sorry' or something like that" after grazing her breast, despite murdering her minutes later.&lt;ref name="vronsky261"/&gt;

Kemper put both of the women's bodies in the trunk of his Ford Galaxie and returned to his apartment. He was stopped on the way by a police officer for having a broken taillight but the officer did not detect the corpses in the car.&lt;ref name="coed8"/&gt; Kemper's roommate was not at home, so he took the bodies into his apartment, where he took photographs of, and had sexual intercourse with, the naked corpses before dismembering them. He then put the body parts into plastic bags, which he later abandoned near [[Loma Prieta|Loma Prieta Mountain]].&lt;ref name="coed8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stephens"/&gt; Before disposing of Pesce's and Luchessa's severed heads in a ravine, Kemper engaged in irrumatio with both of them.&lt;ref name="coed"/&gt; In August, Pesce's skull was found up on Loma Prieta Mountain. An extensive search failed to turn up the rest of Pesce's remains or a trace of Luchessa.&lt;ref name="stephens"/&gt;

===Aiko Koo===

On the evening of September 14, 1972, Kemper picked up 15-year-old Korean dance student Aiko Koo, who had decided to hitchhike to a dance class after missing her bus.&lt;ref name="Scott2007"&gt;{{cite book|first=Gini Graham|last=Scott|title=American Murder &amp;#91;Two Volumes&amp;#93;|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=przN8e1MaYwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA49|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-02476-4|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He again drove to a remote area, pulling a gun on Koo before accidentally locking himself out of his car. However, Koo let him back inside—Kemper had previously gained the 15-year-old's trust while holding her at gunpoint—where he proceeded to choke her unconscious, rape her and kill her.&lt;ref name="coed9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/9.html |title=Psychiatric Follow-up |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210031711/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/9.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently packed her body into the trunk of his car, had a few drinks at a nearby bar, then exited the bar and opened his trunk, "admiring [his] catch like a fisherman,"&lt;ref name="vronsky263"/&gt; and returned to his apartment. Back at his apartment, he had sexual intercourse with the corpse before dismembering and disposing of the remains in a similar manner as his previous two victims.&lt;ref name="coed9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newton2006"&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Newton|title=The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwNVbOcTncwC&amp;pg=PA144|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-6987-3|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koo's mother called the police to report the disappearance of her daughter and put up hundreds of flyers asking for information, but did not receive any responses regarding her daughter's location or status.&lt;ref name="stephens"/&gt;

===Cindy Schall===

On January 7, 1973, Kemper, who had moved back in with his mother, was driving around the [[Cabrillo College]] campus when he picked up 18-year-old student Cynthia Ann "Cindy" Schall. He drove to a sequestered wooded area and fatally shot her with a .22 caliber pistol. He then placed her body in the trunk of his car and drove to his mother's house, where he kept her body hidden in a closet in his room overnight. When his mother left for work the next morning, he had sexual intercourse with, and removed the bullet from, Schall's corpse before dismembering and decapitating it in his mother's bathtub.&lt;ref name="vronsky264"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coed10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/10.html |title=More Victims |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210031712/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/10.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kemper kept Schall's severed head for several days, regularly engaging in irrumatio with it,&lt;ref name="vronsky264"&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; before burying it in his mother's garden facing upward toward her bedroom – later remarking that his mother "always wanted people to look up to her."&lt;ref name="vronsky264"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coed11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/11.html |title=Revenge |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210031713/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/11.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He discarded the rest of her remains by throwing them off a cliff.&lt;ref name="Newton2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coed10"/&gt; Over the course of the following few weeks, all but Schall's head and right hand were discovered and "pieced together like a macabre jigsaw puzzle." Police and a pathologist determined that she had been hacked to death, then cut into pieces with a [[circular saw|power saw]].&lt;ref name="stephens"/&gt;

===Rosalind Thorpe and Allison Liu===
On February 5, 1973, after a heated argument with his mother, Kemper left his house in search of possible victims.&lt;ref name="coed10"/&gt; With heightened suspicion of a serial killer preying on hitchhikers in the Santa Cruz area, students were advised to only get into cars with University stickers on them. Kemper had such a sticker as his mother worked at UCSC.&lt;ref name="larson"/&gt; He encountered 23-year-old Rosalind Heather Thorpe and 20-year-old Alice Helen "Allison" Liu on the UCSC campus. According to Kemper, Thorpe entered his car first, which reassured Liu to also enter.&lt;ref name="stephens"/&gt; He then fatally shot Thorpe and Liu with his .22 caliber pistol and wrapped their bodies in blankets.&lt;ref name="coed10"/&gt;

Kemper again brought his victims back to his mother's house, this time beheading them in his car and carrying a headless corpse into his mother's house to have sexual intercourse with.&lt;ref name="coed10"/&gt; He then dismembered the bodies, removed the bullets to prevent identification and, the next morning, discarded their remains.&lt;ref name="coed10"/&gt; Remains were found at Eden Canyon a week later, and more were found near [[California State Route 1|Highway 1]] in March.&lt;ref name="DouglasOlshaker"&gt;{{harvnb|Douglas|Olshaker|1995|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned in an interview as to why he removed his victims' heads before performing sexual acts on the bodies, he explained: "The head trip fantasies were a bit like a trophy. You know, the head is where everything is at, the brain, eyes, mouth. That's the person. I remember being told as a kid, you cut off the head and the body dies. The body is nothing after the head is cut off&amp;nbsp;... well, that's not quite true, there's a lot left in the girl's body without the head."&lt;ref name="vronsky264"/&gt;

===Clarnell Strandberg and Sally Hallett===

On April 20, 1973, after coming home from a party, 52-year-old Clarnell Elizabeth Strandberg awakened her son with her arrival. While sitting in bed reading a book, she noticed Kemper enter her room and said, "I suppose you're going to want to sit up all night and talk now." Kemper replied "No, good night!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ed Kemper Interview, 1984. 18m25s|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzQCih3QY6A&amp;t=18m25s}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then waited for her to fall asleep and returned to bludgeon her with a [[claw hammer]] then slit her throat with a knife. He subsequently decapitated her and engaged in [[irrumatio]] with her severed head before using it as a [[Darts#Dartboard|dart board]]; Kemper stated that he "put [her head] on a shelf and screamed at it for an hour&amp;nbsp;... threw darts at it," and ultimately, "smashed her face in."&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ed Kemper Interview, 1984. 19m18s|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzQCih3QY6A&amp;t=19m18s}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also cut out her tongue and [[larynx]] and put them in the [[Garbage disposal unit|garbage disposal]]. However, the garbage disposal could not break down the tough [[Vocal folds|vocal cords]] and ejected the tissue back into the sink. "That seemed appropriate," Kemper later said, "as much as she'd bitched and screamed and yelled at me over so many years."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Douglas|Olshaker|1995|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kemper then had sexual intercourse with his mother's corpse, hid it in a closet and went out to drink.&lt;ref name="coed6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/girls_6.html |title=The Call |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210031709/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/girls_6.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, he invited his mother's best friend, 59-year-old Sara Taylor "Sally" Hallett, over to the house for dinner and a movie.&lt;ref name="sfweekly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/news/yesterdays-crimes-big-ed-kemper-coed-butcher/|title=Yesterday's Crimes: Big Ed Kemper the Coed Butcher|first=Bob|last=Calhoun|publisher=[[SF Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Hallett arrived, Kemper strangled her to death, decapitated her and spent the night with her exanimate body.&lt;ref name="coed11"/&gt; He subsequently put her corpse in a closet, obscured any outward signs of a disturbance and left a note to the police reading:

{{blockquote|Appx. 5:15 A.M. Saturday. No need for her to suffer any more at the hands of this horrible "murderous Butcher". It was quick—asleep—the way I wanted it. Not sloppy and incomplete, gents. Just a "lack of time". I got things to do!!!&lt;ref name="vronsky265"&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kemper left the scene, driving nonstop to [[Pueblo, Colorado]].&lt;ref name="coed6"/&gt; After not hearing any news on the radio about the murders of his mother and Hallett when he arrived in Pueblo, he found a phone booth and called the police. He confessed to the murders of his mother and Hallett, but the police did not take his call seriously and told him to call back at a later time.&lt;ref name="sfweekly"/&gt; Several hours later, Kemper called again asking to speak to an officer he personally knew. Kemper then confessed to that officer of killing his mother and Hallett, and waited for the police to arrive and take him into custody, where he also confessed to the murders of the six students.&lt;ref name="DouglasOlshaker"/&gt; When asked why he turned himself in, Kemper said: "The original purpose was gone&amp;nbsp;... It wasn't serving any physical or real or emotional purpose. It was just a pure waste of time&amp;nbsp;... Emotionally, I couldn't handle it much longer. Toward the end there, I started feeling the folly of the whole damn thing, and at the point of near exhaustion, near collapse, I just said to hell with it and called it all off."&lt;ref name="vronsky266"&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==

[[File:Edmund Kemper, 1973.jpg|thumb|Mug shot of Kemper on November 11, 1973|150px]]
Kemper was [[indictment|indicted]] on eight counts of [[Murder (United States law)#Degrees|first-degree murder]] on May 7, 1973.&lt;ref name="coed12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/12.html |title=On Trial |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210031714/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/12.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was assigned the Chief Public Defender of Santa Cruz County, attorney Jim Jackson. Due to Kemper's explicit and detailed confession, his counsel's only option was to plead [[insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]] to the charges. Kemper twice tried to commit [[suicide]] in custody, surviving both times. His trial went ahead on October 23, 1973.&lt;ref name="coed12"/&gt;

Three court-appointed psychiatrists found Kemper to be legally sane. One of the psychiatrists, Dr. Joel Fort, investigated his juvenile records and the diagnosis that he was once psychotic. Fort also interviewed Kemper, including under [[truth serum]], and relayed to the court that Kemper had engaged in [[Human cannibalism|cannibalism]], alleging that he sliced flesh from the legs of his victims, then cooked and consumed these strips of flesh in a [[casserole]].&lt;ref name="schechter34"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coed12"/&gt; Nevertheless, Fort determined that Kemper was fully cognizant in each case, and stated that Kemper enjoyed the prospect of the infamy associated with being labeled a murderer.&lt;ref name="coed12"/&gt; Kemper later recanted the confession of cannibalism.&lt;ref name="coed13"/&gt;

California used the [[M'Naghten rules|M'Naghten standard]] which held that for a defendant to "establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of mind, and not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-procedure/the-m-naghten-rule.html|title=The M'Naghten Rule|publisher=[[FindLaw]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kemper appeared to know that the nature of his acts was wrong, and had also shown signs of [[malice aforethought]].&lt;ref name="coed12"/&gt; On November 1, Kemper took the stand. He testified that he killed the women because he wanted them "for myself, like possessions,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/06/03/Edmund-Kemper-III-the-hulking-former-construction-worker-serving/9336486619200/|title=Edmund Kemper III, the hulking former construction worker serving...|publisher=[[United Press International]]|date=3 June 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempted to convince the jury that he was insane based on the reasoning that his actions could only have been committed by someone with an aberrant mind. He said two beings inhabited his body and that when the killer personality took over it was "kind of like blacking out."&lt;ref name="coed13"/&gt;

On November 8, 1973, the six-man, six-woman jury convened for five hours before declaring Kemper sane and guilty on all counts.&lt;ref name="Biography.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coed13"/&gt; He asked for the death penalty, requesting "death by torture."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schechter|2003|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with a [[Capital punishment in California#1972 suspension of capital punishment|moratorium placed on capital punishment by the Supreme Court at that time]], he instead received seven years to life for each count, with these terms to be served concurrently, and was sentenced to the [[California Medical Facility]].&lt;ref name="coed13"/&gt;

==Imprisonment==
In the [[California Medical Facility]], Kemper was incarcerated in the same prison block as other notorious criminals such as [[Herbert Mullin]] and [[Charles Manson]]. Kemper showed particular disdain for Mullin, who committed his murders at the same time in Santa Cruz as Kemper. He described Mullin as "just a cold-blooded killer&amp;nbsp;... killing everybody he saw for no good reason."&lt;ref name="vronsky266"/&gt; Kemper manipulated and physically intimidated Mullin, who, at {{convert|5|ft|7|in|m}}, was more than a foot shorter than he. Kemper stated that "[Mullin] had a habit of singing and bothering people when somebody tried to watch TV, so I threw water on him to shut him up. Then, when he was a good boy, I'd give him peanuts. Herbie liked peanuts. That was effective, because pretty soon he asked permission to sing. That's called [[behavior modification|behavior modification treatment]]."&lt;ref name="vronsky266"/&gt;

{{as of|2018}}, Kemper remains among the general population in prison and is considered a model prisoner. He is in charge of scheduling other inmates' appointments with psychiatrists and is an accomplished craftsman of ceramic cups.&lt;ref name="coed13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/13.html |title=Kemper on the Stand |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210031715/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/13.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a prolific reader of [[audiobook|books on tape]] for the blind; a 1987 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article stated that at the time he was the coordinator of the prison's program and had personally spent over 5,000 hours narrating books with several hundred completed recordings to his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-29/news/mn-2252_1_blind-couple|title=Blind Couple See Only Good, Not the Guilt of the Helpers|first=Charles|last=Hillinger|date=January 29, 1987|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CDCB52453 2011.jpg|thumb|Kemper on November 17, 2011]]
While imprisoned, Kemper has participated in a number of interviews, including a segment in the 1982 documentary ''[[The Killing of America]]'', as well as an appearance in the 1984 documentary ''Murder: No Apparent Motive''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0157894/|title=The Killing of America|publisher=[[IMDb]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808386/|title=Murder: No Apparent Motive|publisher=[[IMDb]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/new-movies/ten-confronting-documentaries-you-dont-need-netflix-to-watch/news-story/23e1b8085646f3a2806df509e8b921d8|title=Murder: No Apparent Motive|first=Jeremy|last=Cassar|publisher=[[News.com.au]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His interviews are notable for their contribution to understanding the mind of serial killers. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] profiler [[John E.

They need to talk to somebody about it. Trust somebody enough to sit down and talk about something that isn't a crime; thinking that way isn't a crime. Doing it isn't just a crime, it's a horrible thing. It doesn't know when to quit and it can't be stopped easily once it starts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRv8uOnvRBc&amp;t=4214|title=Murder: No Apparent Motive}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also conducted an interview with French writer Stéphane Bourgoin in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8IfslxOmF0|title=Ed Kemper Interview - 1991 (extended)|first=|last=Landau|date=July 8, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=October 21, 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Patrick Bateman]] in the 2000 film [[American Psycho (film)|''American Psycho'']] mistakenly attributes a quote by Kemper to Ed Gein, saying "You know what Ed Gein said about women?&amp;nbsp;... He said 'When I see a pretty girl walking down the street, I think two things. One part of me wants to take her out, talk to her, be real nice and sweet and treat her right&amp;nbsp;... [and the other part of me wonders] what her head would look like on a stick'."&lt;ref name="nypost"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2016/02/10/serial-killer-quoted-in-american-psycho-doesnt-want-to-leave-jail/|title=Serial Killer quoted in American Psycho doesn't want to leave jail|first=Jamie|last=Schram|publisher=''[[New York Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[direct-to-video]] horror film loosely based on Kemper's murders, titled ''[[Kemper: The CoEd Killer]]'', was released in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/8506/lionsgate-giving-thanks-for-ed-kemper/|title = Lionsgate Giving Thanks For Ed Kemper|last = Foy|first = Scott|publisher = Dread Central|date = 7 September 2008|website = dreadcentral.com|accessdate = 7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* French author [[Marc Dugain]] published a novel, ''Avenue des géants'' (''Avenue of the Giants''), about Kemper in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/livre/marc-dugain-dans-la-tete-de-l-assassin_1108200.html|title=Marc Dugain dans la tete de l'assassin|last=Ferniot|first=Christine|date=April 25, 2012|publisher=''[[L'Express]]''|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kemper is portrayed by actor [[Cameron Britton]] in the 2017 [[Netflix]] television drama series [[Mindhunter (TV series)|''Mindhunter'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5290382/fullcredits|title=Mindhunter|publisher=imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
* American [[aggrotech]] band [[Combichrist]] mention Kemper in their track "God Bless" for their album ''[[Everybody Hates You]]''.
* American [[thrash metal]] band [[Macabre (band)|Macabre]] wrote a track about Kemper, titled "Edmund Kemper Had a Horrible Temper", for their ''[[Sinister Slaughter]]'' album.

'''Edward H. "Ed" Morrell''' (October 22, 1868 – November 10, 1946) was an accomplice to the [[Christopher Evans (outlaw)|Evans]] and Sontag gang that robbed the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] in California's [[San Joaquin Valley]] in the 1890s. According to his memoir, "The 25th Man", the robberies were after revenge for the large railroad corporation's mistreatment of local ranchers of the San Joaquin Valley.  Morrell was sentenced to life imprisonment in [[Folsom State Prison]] in 1894. He was eventually transferred to [[San Quentin State Prison|San Quentin]] (1899 at the latest), and pardoned in 1908. Five of his years were spent in [[solitary confinement]];&lt;ref&gt;"Five Years in the Solitary Dungeon", by [[Jack Jungmeyer]], ''The San Francisco Sunday Call'', February 14, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; he was known as the Dungeon Man of San Quentin. Author [[Jack London]] championed his pardon; and Morrell became a frequent guest at London's [[Jack London State Historic Park|Beauty Ranch]] in [[Glen Ellen, California]]. London used Morrell as a character in his 1915 novel ''[[The Star Rover]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Star Rover]]'' was adapted for the 2005 film [[The Jacket]], thus indirectly preserving Morrell on celluloid.&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrell had been subjected to severe physical abuse in prison. After his release, he lectured widely on his experiences and advocated [[prison reform]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, "Ed Morrell's Act Is Too Realistic", ''The San Francisco Call'', June 24, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; He lectured with former San Quentin prisoner and author, [[Donald Lowrie]].&lt;ref&gt;Lowrie, Donald. ''My Life Out of Prison'' (1915).&lt;/ref&gt; Morrell's lectures included addresses to the California and Pennsylvania legislatures. He advocated the abolition of [[corporal punishment]]. In 1914, he wrote a one-act play, ''The Incorrigible'', based on his experiences (and one of his nicknames). In 1924, he published his memoirs, ''The 25th Man: The Strange Story of Ed. Morrell, the Hero of Jack London's Star Rover''.

Morrell was born in [[Cass Township, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Thomaston, Pennsylvania]] on October 22, 1868. He came to California in 1891. "In his later years, he was a colorful habitue of [[Gower Gulch]] and a frequenter of [[Hollywood and Vine]], the crony and pet of Hollywood film people." He died, age 78, in [[Los Angeles]] on November 10, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;"Last Railroad-Raiding Bandit, Ed Morrell, Dies," ''Los Angeles Times'', November 12, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sifakis, Carl. ''The Encyclopedia of American Prisons'', Edward Morrell entry pp. 169-171, [[Infobase Publishing|Facts on File, Inc.]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8799">[[File:Elliptic cylindrical coordinates.png|thumb|right|350px|[[Coordinate surfaces]] of elliptic cylindrical coordinates.  The yellow sheet is the prism of a half-hyperbola corresponding to ν=-45°, whereas the red tube is an elliptical prism corresponding to μ=1.  The blue sheet corresponds to ''z''=1.  The three surfaces intersect at the point '''P''' (shown as a black sphere) with [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] roughly (2.182, -1.661, 1.0).  The foci of the ellipse and hyperbola lie at ''x'' = ±2.0.]]

'''Elliptic cylindrical coordinates''' are a three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]] that results from projecting the two-dimensional [[elliptic coordinates|elliptic coordinate system]] in the
perpendicular &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-direction.  Hence, the [[coordinate surfaces]] are [[prism (geometry)|prisms]] of confocal [[ellipse]]s and [[hyperbola]]e.  The two [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] 
&lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; are generally taken to be fixed at &lt;math&gt;-a&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;+a&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, on the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis of the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].

==Basic definition==

The most common definition of elliptic cylindrical coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\mu, \nu, z)&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
x = a \ \cosh \mu \ \cos \nu
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = a \ \sinh \mu \ \sin \nu
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z = z
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a nonnegative real number and &lt;math&gt;\nu \in [0, 2\pi)&lt;/math&gt;. 

These definitions correspond to ellipses and hyperbolae.  The trigonometric identity

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2} \cosh^{2} \mu} + \frac{y^{2}}{a^{2} \sinh^{2} \mu} = \cos^{2} \nu + \sin^{2} \nu = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

shows that curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; form [[ellipse]]s, whereas the hyperbolic trigonometric identity

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2} \cos^{2} \nu} - \frac{y^{2}}{a^{2} \sin^{2} \nu} = \cosh^{2} \mu - \sinh^{2} \mu = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

shows that curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; form [[hyperbola]]e.

==Scale factors==

The scale factors for the elliptic cylindrical coordinates &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; are equal

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\mu} = h_{\nu} = a\sqrt{\sinh^{2}\mu + \sin^{2}\nu}
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the remaining scale factor &lt;math&gt;h_{z}=1&lt;/math&gt;.  
Consequently, an infinitesimal volume element equals

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = a^{2} \left( \sinh^{2}\mu + \sin^{2}\nu \right) d\mu d\nu dz
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian equals 

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^{2} \Phi = \frac{1}{a^{2} \left( \sinh^{2}\mu + \sin^{2}\nu \right)} \left( \frac{\partial^{2} \Phi}{\partial \mu^{2}} + \frac{\partial^{2} \Phi}{\partial \nu^{2}} \right) + \frac{\partial^{2} \Phi}{\partial z^{2}} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\mu, \nu, z)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting 
the scale factors into the general formulae found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

==Alternative definition==

An alternative and geometrically intuitive set of elliptic coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, z)&lt;/math&gt; are sometimes used, where &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \cosh \mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau = \cos \nu&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence, the curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; are ellipses, whereas the curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are hyperbolae.  The coordinate &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; must belong to the interval [-1, 1], whereas the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; 
coordinate must be greater than or equal to one.
 
The coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, z)&lt;/math&gt; have a simple relation to the distances to the foci &lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  For any point in the (x,y) plane, the ''sum'' &lt;math&gt;d_{1}+d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; of its distances to the foci equals &lt;math&gt;2a\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, whereas their ''difference'' &lt;math&gt;d_{1}-d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;2a\tau&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, the distance to &lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;a(\sigma+\tau)&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the distance to &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;a(\sigma-\tau)&lt;/math&gt;.  (Recall that &lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; are located at &lt;math&gt;x=-a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x=+a&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.) 

A drawback of these coordinates is that they do not have a 1-to-1 transformation to the [[Cartesian coordinates]]
:&lt;math&gt;
x = a\sigma\tau
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y^{2} = a^{2} \left( \sigma^{2} - 1 \right) \left(1 - \tau^{2} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

==Alternative scale factors==

The scale factors for the alternative elliptic coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, z)&lt;/math&gt; are 

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\sigma} = a\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^{2} - \tau^{2}}{\sigma^{2} - 1}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\tau} = a\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^{2} - \tau^{2}}{1 - \tau^{2}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

and, of course, &lt;math&gt;h_{z}=1&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence, the infinitesimal volume element becomes 

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = a^{2} \frac{\sigma^{2} - \tau^{2}}{\sqrt{\left( \sigma^{2} - 1 \right) \left( 1 - \tau^{2} \right)}} d\sigma d\tau dz
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian equals

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^{2} \Phi = 
\frac{1}{a^{2} \left( \sigma^{2} - \tau^{2} \right) }
\left[
\sqrt{\sigma^{2} - 1} \frac{\partial}{\partial \sigma} 
\left( \sqrt{\sigma^{2} - 1} \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \sigma} \right) + 
\sqrt{1 - \tau^{2}} \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} 
\left( \sqrt{1 - \tau^{2}} \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \tau} \right)
\right] + 
\frac{\partial^{2} \Phi}{\partial z^{2}} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; 
and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting 
the scale factors into the general formulae 
found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

==Applications==
The classic applications of elliptic cylindrical coordinates are in solving [[partial differential equations]], 
e.g., [[Laplace's equation]] or the [[Helmholtz equation]], for which elliptic cylindrical coordinates allow a 
[[separation of variables]].  A typical example would be the [[electric field]] surrounding a 
flat conducting plate of width &lt;math&gt;2a&lt;/math&gt;.

The three-dimensional [[wave equation]], when expressed in elliptic cylindrical coordinates, may be solved by separation of variables, leading to the [[Mathieu differential equation]]s.

The geometric properties of elliptic coordinates can also be useful.  A typical example might involve 
an integration over all pairs of vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}&lt;/math&gt; 
that sum to a fixed vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{q}&lt;/math&gt;, where the integrand 
was a function of the vector lengths &lt;math&gt;\left| \mathbf{p} \right|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \mathbf{q} \right|&lt;/math&gt;.  (In such a case, one would position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; between the two foci and aligned with the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = 2a \mathbf{\hat{x}}&lt;/math&gt;.)  For concreteness,  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}&lt;/math&gt; could represent the [[momentum|momenta]] of a particle and its decomposition products, respectively, and the integrand might involve the kinetic energies of the products (which are proportional to the squared lengths of the momenta).

'''Engineering analysis''' involves the application of scientific analytic principles and processes to reveal the properties and state of a system, device or mechanism under study.  Engineering analysis is decompositional: it proceeds by separating the engineering design into the mechanisms of operation or failure, analyzing or estimating each component of the operation or failure mechanism in isolation, and re-combining the components according to basic physical principles and natural laws.&lt;ref&gt;Baecher, G.B., Pate, E.M., and de Neufville, R. (1979) “Risk of dam failure in benefit/cost analysis”, Water Resources Research, 16(3), 449-456.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartford, D.N.D. and Baecher, G.B. (2004) Risk and Uncertainty in Dam Safety. Thomas Telford&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD) (2003) Risk Assessment in Dam Safety Management. ICOLD, Paris&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;British Standards Institution (BSI) (1991)BC 5760 Part 5: Reliability of systems equipment and components - Guide to failure modes effects and criticality analysis (FMEA and FMECA).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remote systems==
Engineering analysis is the primary method for predicting and handling issues with remote systems such as [[Satellite|satellites]] and rovers. Engineering analysis for remote systems must be ongoing since the health and safety of the remote system can only be affected remotely (and because any failure could have fatal consequences). The capabilities of engineering analysis therefore must incorporate trending as well as analysis. Trending should be proactive, predictive, comprehensive and automated. Analysis must be reactive, investigative, targeted and hands-on. Together trending and analysis allow operators to both predict potential situations and identify anomalous events that threaten a remote system.

[[File:PBS Evolution.jpg|frame|Series logo]]
'''''Evolution''''' is a 2001 [[Documentary film|documentary]] [[television program|series]] by the [[United States|American]] broadcaster [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) and [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] on [[evolutionary biology]], from the producers of ''[[Nova_(TV_series)|NOVA]]''.
==Overview==
The spokespeople for the series were [[Jane Goodall]] (overall spokesperson), [[Kenneth R. Miller]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]] (science spokespeople), [[Eugenie C. Scott]] (education spokesperson), [[Arthur Peacocke]] and [[Arnold Thomas]] (religious spokespeople).  The series was narrated by the Irish actor [[Liam Neeson]].

The series was accompanied by a book by the popular science writer [[Carl Zimmer]] ''[[Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl|last=Zimmer|authorlink=Carl Zimmer|title=[[Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea]]|isbn=0-06-019906-7|year=2001|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An extensive website provides teaching resources for each episode's material, including "The Mating Game", further looks at [[Charles Darwin]], and an interactive history of [[speciation]] in the invented "pollencreeper" birds.

The episode "What about God?" features discussion of the issues of [[evolution]] and [[creationism]] at [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]], an [[evangelicalism|Evangelical]] [[Protestant]] college that teaches [[evolution]] but has in the past restricted professors from taking a stance on the literal versus the allegorical interpretations of Adam and Eve in the Genesis account of creation.

==Reception==
TV critic [[Julie Salamon]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', said that "[a] powerful sense of drama, discovery and intellectual enthusiasm runs through this rich eight-hour series ... The series covers an enormous amount of ground but doesn't leave you feeling swamped."&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07EFDA173AF937A1575AC0A9679C8B63 A Stark Explanation for Mankind From an Unlikely Rebel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Being made and broadcast in the country where [[creation-evolution controversy]] is strongest, the last episode ''What About God?'' focused on [[religion]], and "through personal stories of students and teachers, it offers [[theistic evolution|the view that they are compatible]]".  Phina Borgeson, Faith Network Director of the [[National Center for Science Education]], provided a Congregational Study Guide for Evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncseweb.org/article.asp?category=11 Congregational Study Guide for Evolution] from the [[National Center for Science Education]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, the [[Discovery Institute]]'s [[Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture]] produced a website to refute the documentary and started a petition it called [[A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism]] to show that there were "scientists that dispute the claims".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reviewevolution.com/ A Critique of PBS's Evolution], [[Discovery Institute]]'s [[Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture]]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''exclosure''', in an area being used extensively for grazing, is a limited area from which unwanted animals, for example browsing animals, such as domestic [[cattle]] or wildlife, such as [[deer]], are excluded by fencing or other means.  Exclosures are sometimes constructed by government agencies that manage livestock use on public lands—a practice in which private owners of cattle pay, though often only a nominal sum, for the right to graze their livestock on the public lands.

One purpose of the exclosure is to determine how the area would develop (in [[biodiversity]], vegetation height, [[ecology|ecological]] characteristics, etc.) if grazing were not conducted.

Another purpose is to demarcate an area safe for humans by excluding potentially deadly animals.  For example, a beach may have a shark net around it to prevent sharks from attacking human swimmers.  Another example is at wild animal preserves which provide fenced in areas for humans to safely watch lions, tigers, or other large predators.

[[File:Food waste.png|thumb|Food waste recycling]]

'''Food waste recycling''' is a process to convert [[food waste]] into useful materials and products for achieving sustainability of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ts-1.eee.hku.hk/ccst9015sp12/greentech2/recycling-definition-and-overview/ Recycling: Definition and Overview]. ''Think Green''.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Food waste]] is defined as all inedible and edible parts of food that creates preceding and succeeding food processing, production and consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpower.org.hk/html/eng/2013_6.shtml Hong Kong's “Zero Food Waste"]. ''Green Power'', Jun 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Green house gas|Greenhouse gases]], especially [[methane]] can be reduced by food waste recycling. Food waste recycling can also alleviate the saturation of [[landfill]] sites in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.epa.gov/region9/waste/features/foodtoenergy/food-waste.html Turning Food Waste into Energy at the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD)]. ''US Environmental Protection Agency''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Current situation of food waste in Hong Kong===
The amount of food waste accounts for 38% of the [[municipal solid waste]] in [[Hong Kong]]. According to the statistics published by the [[Environmental Protection Department]], Hong Kong generates approximately 3,648 tonnes of food waste each day. About one-third of the food waste comes from the commercial and industrial sectors while the remaining part is from [[households]]. The situation of food waste disposal in [[Hong Kong]] has become more serious in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-hongkong-rubbish/hong-kong-drowning-in-waste-as-china-rubbish-ban-takes-toll-idUKKBN1FK0J9?il=0https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-hongkong-rubbish/hong-kong-drowning-in-waste-as-china-rubbish-ban-takes-toll-idUKKBN1FK0J9?il=0|title=Hong Kong drowning in waste as China rubbish ban takes toll|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=U.K.|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of food waste from the commercial and industry sectors increased from 400 tonnes in 2002 to 1033 tonnes in 2014.&lt;ref name="epd"&gt;[http://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/english/environmentinhk/waste/prob_solutions/owt_food.html Food Waste Management in HK]. '' Environmental Protection Department''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three steps of food waste recycling in Hong Kong===
Food waste recycling typically involves a three-step strategy that includes [[Separation process|separation]], [[Waste collection|collection]] and [[recycling]]. These three steps are interdependent and equally important in efficiently generating useful resources from food waste recycling.

====Separation====
The collected food waste is separated into two categories: pre-consumer food waste and post-consumer food waste. Pre-consumer food waste includes animal food waste, vegetable food waste, and waste from industrially-processed food. Post-consumer food waste refers to leftover food, such as from an unfinished restaurant order. Source separation also involves removing any food packaging and utensils.&lt;ref name="enb"&gt;[http://www.enb.gov.hk/en/files/FoodWastePolicyEng.pdf A Food Waste &amp; Yard Waste Plan For Hong Kong 2014-2022]. '' Environment Bureau '', February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Collection====
Food waste vehicles, managed by the government, collect and deliver food waste to governmental recycling facilities. These recycling facilities, known as Organic Waste Treatment Facilities (OWTFs), will be spread across [[Districts of Hong Kong|Hong Kong's districts]]. The government plans to construct 5 to 6 OWTF networks, with a goal of recycling 1300 to 1500 tonnes of food waste between 2014 and 2024. The first facility is planned to be built in [[Siu Ho Wan]] to serve [[Lantau Island]] and districts nearby. The second and third are projected to be built in [[Sha Ling]] and [[Shek Kong]] so as to serve the [[New Territories]] and [[West Kowloon]].

The [[Environmental Protection Department]] also plans to construct two Organic Resources Recovery Centres (ORRCs) to collect the food waste and turn it into compost for recovery. These two centres will collectively be able to treat 500 tonnes of organic waste and divert 200 to 300 tonnes of waste from the landfills daily.&lt;ref name="ORRC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Organic Resources Recovery Centre (ORRC) |url=https://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/english/environmentinhk/waste/prob_solutions/WFdev_OWTF.html |website=Environmental Protection Department |accessdate=July 23, 2018 |date=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Centre will also be located in [[Siu Ho Wan]]. The construction works commenced in December 2014 and it is expected to be commissioned in early 2018.&lt;ref name="ORRC" /&gt;

====Recycling====
Two technologies are used to turn food waste into biogas and useful products. The first technology is a low-carbon method that processes 100 to 300 of tonnes food waste per day.&lt;ref name="enb" /&gt; By applying this technology, it produces a source of the renewable energy [[biogas]]. It is estimated that the first Centre will be able to provide 14 million kWh of electricity to Hong Kong's power grid every year, which can power 3,000 households.&lt;ref name="ORRC" /&gt; The second technology converts food waste into [[succinic acid]] by using [[enzyme]]s and [[bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee, K., Lin, S., &amp; Chan, C. (2013) [https://www.cityu.edu.hk/see/news/TurningFoodWasteIntoTreasure.pdf Turning Food Waste into Treasure]. '' Housing Dynamics ''.&lt;/ref&gt; The residues can be processed to be [[animal feed]], [[fertilizer]]s and environmental-friendly cleansing products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foodwaste.foe.org.hk/html/eng/c_convert.php What is the use of food waste?]. ''Friends of the Earth'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hong Kong Food Waste Recycling Program==

===The Hong Kong Government===

====Food Waste Recycling Partnership Scheme====
Food waste recycling partnership scheme is introduced by the [[Environmental Protection Department]] in 2009. The scheme was designed to promote a good practice on food waste management and enhance people’s experiences of separating and recycling food waste sources. The scheme collaborated with commercial and industrial sectors. Some members from the Hong Kong Government and that of the commercial and industrial sectors formed a working group for planning and managing the operation of the project. There are about 20 to 30 public and private organizations that participate in the scheme every year. In the project, all the participants will have a chance to practice separation process of food waste sources. The collection process of separated food waste will be carried out by the [[Environmental Protection Department]] and the [[Kowloon Bay Pilot Composting Plant]] will be responsible to the recycling part. The scheme also consists of discussion sessions for the participating parties to share their experience of recycling food waste. All participants will receive a commendation certificate at the end of the project.&lt;ref name="epd" /&gt;

====Food Waste Recycling Projects in Housing Estates====
From November 2012 to July 2014, The [[Hong Kong Housing Authority]] implemented a trial scheme, named as [[Food Waste Recycling Projects in Housing Estates]], with an aim to promote waste recycling in housing estates. The scheme involved 14 estates with about 3200 households. There were two modes adopted in the scheme. One is to convert food waste to fish grain by transporting them to a Central Food Waste Recycling Plant. The other one is to convert food waste into compost for farm by using [[micro-organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201412/17/P201412170528.htm LCQ16: Food waste recycling trial scheme in public housing estates]. ''Hong Kong Information Services Department'', 17 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Food Waste Recycling Scheme on Cheung Chau and Lamma Island====
On 31 March 2012, The Environmental Protection Department introduced a recycling scheme on [[Cheung Chau]] and [[Lamma Island]]. The purpose of the scheme is to promote and encourage food waste recycling on both islands. Food waste collected from shops and restaurants would be transported to the food waste treatment facilities on the islands. The food waste would be converted to organic compost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201305/08/P201305080291.htm LCQ9: Reduction and treatment of food waste]. ''Hong Kong Information Services Department'', 8 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-governmental organization===

====Hong Kong Organic Waste Recycling Centre====
[[Hong Kong Organic Waste Recycling Centre]] (HKOWRC) was established in 2011 as the first [[organic waste management]] consulting firm in Hong Kong. It combines local and foreign technologies to provide one-stop organic recycling services to customers. The assistance in collection of food waste solves problems of companies in immature recycling. Through commitment to different types of people, HKOWRC can promote and provide waste management training for particular customers.&lt;ref name="hkowrc"&gt;[http://www.hkowrc.com/eng-service.html Our Services]. ''Hong Kong Organic Waste Recycling Centre''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Daily Food Waste Recycling Service=====
The objectives of the collection and recycling routine are to educate the general public in cherishing food as well as making good use of resources. The service encourages two-way cooperation for food waste recycling. HKOWRC aims to provide 24-hour recycling services particularly to [[Breeders|livestock breeders]], [[farmers]], [[Catering|catering industry]], [[schools]] and large-scale [[housing estates]]. For most of the cases, the recycled food waste is to be used by the service targets again for other purposes, therefore avoiding wastage of resources. For [[Breeders|livestock breeders]] and [[farmers]], the recycled food waste is converted to [[animal feeds]] and [[fertilizers]] that contain richer nutritional values than the conventional ones. It possibly gives higher yield. For [[Catering|catering industry]], the recycled food waste is converted to crops which are grown from organic compost from HKOWRC for latest organic food at a special prize. For [[schools]] and [[housing estates]], it aims to raise the awareness of food [[waste reduction]] when the recycling service reveals the huge amount of food wastes accumulated.&lt;ref name="hkowrc" /&gt;

'''Frank Seishi Emi''' (September 23, 1916 – December 1, 2010) was a [[Japanese American]] civil rights activist. He was a leading figure of the [[Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee]], an [[ad hoc]] group who protested the drafting of Japanese Americans [[Japanese American internment|incarcerated]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="LAT-Emi"&gt;Elaine Woo. [http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-frank-emi-20101209,0,5659100.story "Frank S. Emi dies at 94; Japanese American fought effort to draft WWII internees"] ''Los Angeles Times'', Dec 09, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Emi argued it was unconstitutional to conscript men who had been stripped of their civil rights into military service and advised [[Nisei]] who received draft orders to demand they be released from camp before reporting for duty. He was convicted of conspiring to violate the [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940|Selective Service Act]] and served eighteen months of a four-year sentence in federal prison. For many years, Emi and his fellow draft resisters were condemned as troublemakers by the [[Japanese American Citizens League]] and the larger Japanese American community,&lt;ref name="Densho-HMFPC"&gt;Eric L. Muller. [http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Heart_Mountain_Fair_Play_Committee/ "Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee"] ''Densho Encyclopedia'' (accessed Feb 19, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; but his legacy has more recently come to be seen as an important example of civil disobedience.&lt;ref name="Densho-Emi"&gt;Esther Newman. [http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Frank%20Emi/ "Frank Emi"] ''Densho Encyclopedia'' (accessed Feb 19, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Frank Seishi Emi was born in [[Los Angeles]] on September 23, 1916. When he was four years old, his family moved to the [[San Fernando Valley]], where they farmed and eventually opened a produce market. He attended [[San Fernando High School]] for two years, until his family moved again to open a grocery store in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]]. He graduated from [[Long Beach Polytechnic High School]] and entered the [[Los Angeles City College]]'s pharmacy program.&lt;ref name="LAT-Emi"/&gt; After his father was seriously injured in a car accident, Emi left school to run the family's produce market in downtown Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Densho-Emi"/&gt;

By 1941, Emi was running a successful business. He had just invested $25,000 to expand the market when [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] was attacked on December 7, 1941.&lt;ref name="Densho-Emi"/&gt; He was not immediately worried, recalling later, "we didn't have an inkling that we ourselves were going to be bothered because we Nisei had been born here in this country and we were citizens."&lt;ref&gt;Frank Emi interview, Japanese American World War II Evacuation Oral History Project, Calisphere, University of California.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after [[Executive Order 9066]] put into motion the removal of Japanese Americans from the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], he was forced to sell the family business for $1,500,&lt;ref name="Densho-Emi"/&gt; about six cents for each dollar of the produce market's real value.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Nakagawa. [http://www.nikkeiwest.com/index.php/the-news/archived-article-list/166-frank-emi-leader-of-heart-mountain-draft-resisters-dies-at-94 "Frank Emi, Leader of Heart Mountain Draft Resisters, Dies at 94"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225102351/http://www.nikkeiwest.com/index.php/the-news/archived-article-list/166-frank-emi-leader-of-heart-mountain-draft-resisters-dies-at-94 |date=2014-02-25 }} NikkeiWest, Dec 19, 2010 (accessed Feb 19, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Emi moved into his parents' house with his wife and two children once evacuation orders began to circulate in early 1942, to ensure the family would not be separated and sent to different camps.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} They were held at the hastily constructed Pomona [[Japanese American internment#WCCA Civilian Assembly Centers|Assembly Center]] for three months, before being sent to the [[Heart Mountain Relocation Center]], halfway between the cities of [[Cody, Wyoming|Cody]] and [[Powell, Wyoming|Powell]] in [[Wyoming]], in September 1942.&lt;ref name="LAT-Emi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Densho-Emi"/&gt;

==Draft resistance==
In early 1943, the [[War Relocation Authority]] began to distribute a "Leave Clearance Form," better known as the [[Japanese American internment#Loyalty questions and segregation|loyalty questionnaire]] because of two controversial questions that attempted to discern the loyalty of imprisoned Japanese Americans. Question 27 asked whether men would be willing to serve in the armed forces, while Question 28 asked inmates to forswear their allegiance to the [[Emperor of Japan]]. While many gave unqualified affirmative responses, many, like Emi, were confused and offended by the questions' implications. Emi's response to both was, "Under the present conditions and circumstances, I am unable to answer this question,"&lt;ref name="LAT-Emi"/&gt; and he encouraged others to do the same, posting fliers with suggested answers around Heart Mountain.&lt;ref name="Densho-Emi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTobit"&gt;Dennis Hevesi. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/us/19emi.html "Frank Emi, Defiant World War II Internee, Dies at 94,"] ''The New York Times'', 18 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1943, with new soldiers to replace those who had died in combat in high demand, the previous restrictions against Nisei men (listed as enemy aliens ineligible for service after Pearl Harbor) were set aside in order to create a segregated unit of Japanese American volunteers.&lt;ref name="Odo-442"&gt;Franklin Odo. [http://encyclopedia.densho.org/442nd_Regimental_Combat_Team/ "442nd Regimental Combat Team,"] ''Densho Encyclopedia'' (accessed 18 Mar 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Given the nickname "[[442nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|Go For Broke]]" for its soldier's willingness to put their lives at risk in battle, the unit suffered an extremely high casualty rate and soon required fresh troops. A 1944 amendment to the [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940|Selective Service Act]] reinstated the draft for men in camp when only 1,181 inmates volunteered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulelake.org Tule Lake Committee: "History"] (accessed 18 Mar 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Emi and five other Heart Mountain inmates joined Kiyoshi Okamoto, a vocal protestor against the loyalty questionnaire and the incarceration who called himself a "Fair Play Committee of One," to form the Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee.&lt;ref name="LAT-Emi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Densho-HMFPC"/&gt; The Committee encouraged other inmates to refuse military service until their full citizenship rights were restored, and held public meetings to discuss the unconstitutionality of their confinement. As more young men joined the Committee and refused to comply with draft orders, the federal government took action.

On March 25, 1944, twelve Heart Mountain inmates who had not reported for their draft physicals were arrested by [[U.S. Marshals]].&lt;ref name="Densho-Emi"/&gt; Undeterred, more young men followed their example, and Emi and two other Committee members who had not received drafted notices (Emi was married with children) attempted to walk out of camp to highlight their status as prisoners.&lt;ref name="Densho-Emi"/&gt; Later that year, sixty-three Heart Mountain resisters were arrested after failing to show up for their induction and were subsequently tried in federal court and convicted of felony [[draft evasion]]&lt;ref name="Densho-Emi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C&amp;C-Resistance"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/itvs/conscience/resistance/index.html ''Conscience and the Constitution'': "Resistance."] PBS. (accessed 18 Mar 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; and, at the suggestion of the [[Japanese American Citizens League]], whose leaders had lobbied the government to permit Nisei men to join the war effort, the added charge of [[sedition]].&lt;ref name="Lyon-JACL"&gt;Cherstin M. Lyon. [http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Japanese_American_Citizens_League/ "Japanese American Citizens League,"] ''Densho Encyclopedia'' (accessed Feb 19, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 300 draft resisters from Heart Mountain and seven other WRA camps were arrested and stood trial for these charges; almost all served at least two years in federal prison.&lt;ref name="Muller-DR"&gt;Eric L. Muller. [http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Draft%20resistance/ "Draft resistance,"] ''Densho Encyclopedia'' (accessed 18 Mar 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The seven leaders of the Fair Play Committee, who were not eligible for the draft because of their age or domestic status, were convicted of conspiracy to violate the Selective Service Act and sentenced to four years in federal prison.&lt;ref name="Muller-DR"/&gt; Emi served 18 months at the [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|U.S. Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas]], before his and the other leader's sentences were overturned by a federal appeals court in December 1945.&lt;ref name="LAT-Emi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Densho-HMFPC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C&amp;C-Resistance"/&gt;

==Post-war legacy==
Outside prison, Emi and his fellow draft resisters found that most of their peers viewed them with disdain and considered their wartime resistance a sign of disloyalty and cowardice, a stain on the Japanese American community in general and the legacy of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team in particular.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Muller-DR"/&gt; This stigma would not begin to change until the late 1970s and early 1980s, when a younger generation of [[Sansei]] began to push for [[Japanese American internment#Reparations and redress|redress]] and a reexamination of their parents' and grandparents' wartime experiences. In 2000, the Japanese American Citizens League reversed their stance and offered Emi and the other resisters a formal apology.&lt;ref name="LAT-Emi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lyon-JACL"/&gt;

After the war, Frank Emi worked as a gardener and a grocery clerk before beginning a career with the postal service. After retiring from the post office, he worked at a state unemployment office until 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/itvs/conscience/the_story/characters/emi_frank.html ''Conscience and the Constitution'': "Frank Emi,"] PBS (accessed 18 Mar 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to 8th-degree [[black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in 2008, he was also the head instructor of the Hollywood Judo Dojo and was credited for producing several national [[judo]] athletes.&lt;ref name="LAT-Emi"/&gt;

Emi died on December 1, 2010, in [[West Covina, California]], the last surviving member of the Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee.&lt;ref name="LAT-Emi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;

The "'''ghost in the machine'''" is [[United Kingdom|British]] philosopher [[Gilbert Ryle]]'s description of [[René Descartes]]' [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|mind-body dualism]]. Ryle introduced the phrase in ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' (1949)&lt;ref name="Ryle 1949"&gt;''Ryle, Gilbert'', "Descartes' Myth," in '''The Concept of Mind,''' Hutchinson, London, 1949&lt;/ref&gt; to highlight the view of Descartes and others that mental and physical activity occur simultaneously but separately.&lt;ref name= "tanney"&gt;Tanney, Julia [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ryle/ "Gilbert Ryle"], in ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''; Dec 18, 2007; substantive revision Mon Nov 2, 2009 (accessed Oct. 30, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gilbert Ryle==
{{main|Gilbert Ryle}}

Gilbert Ryle (1900–76) was a philosopher who lectured at Oxford and made important contributions to the [[philosophy of mind]] and to "[[ordinary language philosophy]]". His most important writings include ''Philosophical Arguments'' (1945), ''The Concept of Mind'' (1949), ''Dilemmas'' (1954), ''Plato's Progress'' (1966), and ''On Thinking'' (1979).

Ryle's ''The Concept of Mind'' (1949) critiques the notion that the [[Mind–body problem|mind is distinct from the body]] and refers to the idea as "the ghost in the machine". According to Ryle, the classical [[theory of mind]], or "Cartesian rationalism", makes a basic [[category mistake]], because it attempts to analyze the relation between "mind" and "body" as if they were terms of the same logical category. This confusion of logical categories may be seen in other theories of the relation between mind and matter. For example, the idealist theory of mind makes a basic category mistake by attempting to reduce physical reality to the same status as mental reality, while the materialist theory of mind makes a basic category mistake by attempting to reduce mental reality to the same status as physical reality.&lt;ref name="Ribeiro"&gt;de Morais Ribeiro, Henrique, [http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Cogn/CognRibe.htm "On the Philosophy of Cognitive Science"], ''Proceedings of the 20th World Congress of Philosophy'', Boston MA, 10–15 August 1998 (accessed 29 October 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Jones"&gt;Jones, Roger (2008)[http://www.philosopher.org.uk/mind.htm "Philosophy of Mind, Introduction to Philosophy since the Enlightenment"], philosopher.org  (accessed Oct. 30, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Concept of Mind'' ==
{{main|The Concept of Mind}}

=== Official doctrine ===
Ryle states that (as of the time of his writing, in 1949) there was an "official [[doctrine]]," which he refers to as a [[dogma]], of philosophers, the doctrine of [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|body/mind dualism]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a doctrine about the nature and place of the [[mind]] which is prevalent among [[theorist]]s, to which most [[philosopher]]s, [[psychologist]]s and religious teachers subscribe with minor reservations. Although they admit certain theoretical difficulties in it, they tend to assume that these can be overcome without serious modifications being made to the architecture of the theory.... [the doctrine states that] with the doubtful exceptions of the mentally-incompetent and infants-in-arms, every human being has both a body and a mind. ... The body and the mind are ordinarily harnessed together, but after the death of the body the mind may continue to exist and function.&lt;ref name="Ryle p.11"&gt;''Ryle, Gilbert,'' '''The Concept of Mind''' (1949); The University of Chicago Press edition, Chicago, 2002, p 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ryle states that the central principles of the doctrine are unsound and conflict with the entire body of what we know about the mind. Of the doctrine, he says "According to the official doctrine each person has direct and unchangeable [[wiktionary:Cognisance|cognisance]]. In [[consciousness]], [[self-awareness|self-consciousness]] and [[introspection]], he is directly and authentically apprised of the present states of operation of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;''Cottingham, John,'' '''Western philosophy: an anthology''' [https://books.google.com/books?id=imkTo_sNrKcC&amp;lpg=PT189&amp;ots=Yi75crOvV9&amp;dq=here%20is%20a%20doctrine%20about%20the%20nature%20and%20place%20of%20the%20mind%20which%20is%20prevalent%20among%20theorists&amp;pg=PT189#v=onepage&amp;q=here%20is%20a%20doctrine%20about%20the%20nature%20and%20place%20of%20the%20mind%20which%20is%20prevalent%20among%20theorists&amp;f=false Google Books Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ryle's estimation of the official doctrine ===

Ryle's philosophical arguments in his essay "Descartes' Myth" lay out his notion of the mistaken foundations of mind-body dualism conceptions, comprising a suggestion that to speak of mind and body as a substance, as a dualist does, is to commit a category mistake. Ryle writes:&lt;ref name="Ryle 1949" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Such in outline is the official theory. I shall often speak of it, with deliberate abusiveness, as "'''the dogma of the Ghost in the Machine'''." I hope to prove that it is entirely false, and false not in detail but in principle. It is not merely an assemblage of particular mistakes. It is one big mistake and a mistake of a special kind. It is, namely, a category mistake. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ryle then attempts to show that the "official doctrine" of mind/body dualism is false by asserting that it confuses two logical-types, or categories, as being compatible. He states "it represents the facts of mental life as if they belonged to one logical type/category, when they actually belong to another. The dogma is therefore a philosopher's myth."

[[Arthur Koestler]] brought Ryle's concept to wider attention in his 1967 book ''[[The Ghost in the Machine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Koestler, Arthur'', '''The Ghost in the Machine,''' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; The book's main focus is mankind's movement towards self-destruction, particularly in the [[nuclear arms]] arena. It is particularly critical of [[B. F. Skinner]]'s [[behaviorism|behaviourist theory]]. One of the book's central concepts is that as the human brain has grown, it has built upon earlier, more primitive brain structures, and that this is the "ghost in the machine" of the title. Koestler's theory is that at times these structures can overpower higher [[logic]]al functions, and are responsible for [[hate]], [[anger]] and other such destructive impulses.

==Popular culture==
* Author [[Stephen King]] used the concept of the ghost in the machine to refer to his character [[List of The Dark Tower characters#Blaine the Mono|Blaine the Mono]], the train with a split mind that runs the town of Lud in his 1991 novel ''[[The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands]]'' from his series [[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]].
*  [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]'' contains a chapter called "Ghost in the Machine", referring to the virtual consciousness inside a computer.
* The Japanese manga and anime ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' takes place in a future where computer technology has evolved to be able to interface with the human brain making artificial intelligence and cyber-brains indistinguishable from organic brains. The main character, Major [[Motoko Kusanagi]] has a body that is completely cybernetic, her brain being the only part of her that is still human.

[[File:Krönung des Tugendhelden.jpg|thumb|''Krönung des Tugendhelden'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]], circa 1612-1614]]


'''Glory''' is high renown, praise and honor obtained by notable achievements, and based in extensive common consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oxford Dictionaries|title=Glory|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/glory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Merriam-Webster|title=Glory|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/glory}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek culture fame and glory were highly considered, as it is explained in  The Symposium, one of Plato's dialogs.

==In Greek culture (Kleos)==
{{Main|Kleos}}
[[File:Achilles mourning the death of Patroclus, Corinthian Chytra.jpg|thumb|350px|Achilles mourning the death of Patroclus. Corinthian Chytra]]
'''''Kleos''''' (Greek: κλέος) is the [[Greek language|Greek]] word often translated to "renown", or "glory". It is related to the word "to hear" and carries the implied meaning of "what others hear about you". A Greek [[hero]] earns ''kleos'' through accomplishing great deeds, often through his own death. ''Kleos'' is invariably transferred from father to son; the son is responsible for carrying on and building upon the "glory" of the father.

''Kleos'' is a common theme in [[Homer]]'s epics, the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', the main example in the latter being that of [[Odysseus]] and his son Telemachus, who is concerned that his father may have died a pathetic and pitiable death at sea rather than a reputable and gracious one in battle.

==Plato==
The Greek philosopher Plato, in his dialog [[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]] devoted to discuss love, makes a digression into the subject of fame and glory. It is in the section that deals with the dialog between [[Socrates]] and [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]]. She is explaining that men search ways to reach some kind of immortality, for instance by means of physical and intellectual procreation. Then asserts that the love for fame and glory is very strong, and in fact to obtain them, men are ready to engage in great efforts, and also run risks and sacrifices, even of their lives, and still more for this than for their children.  Then makes concrete references to [[Alcestis]] that died to save [[Admetus]], or [[Achilles]] to avenge [[Patroclus]], and to [[Codrus]], as examples of heroes in search of fame and immortal renown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hamilton|first1=Walter|title=Plato, The Symposium|date=1951|publisher=Penguin Classics|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jorge Manrique==
[[Jorge Manrique]] was a prominent Spanish poet of the fifteenth century. His most celebrated work was ''Coplas a la Muerte de su Padre'' (''Stanzas about the death of his father'') that was translated into the English language by poet [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]. In it is an explanation of the three lives of men:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*The terrestrial life, that ends with the death
*The life of fame, that is retained by men's memory.
*The eternal life, of the Christian faith.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The life of fame is expressed in the following verses:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cortina|first1=Augusto|title=Coplas por la Muerte de su Padre|url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra-visor-din/obra-completa--0/html/ff6c9480-82b1-11df-acc7-002185ce6064_4.html#I_53_|publisher=Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes|accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;No se os haga tan amarga         (Should not be so bitter)		
la batalla temerosa              (The fearsome battle)		
que esperáis,                    (you are facing)		
pues otra vida más larga         (since a longer life)		
de la fama gloriosa              (of glorious fame)

{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[Thermodynamic system|Systems]]}}

In [[thermodynamics]] and [[engineering]], a '''heat engine''' is a system that converts heat or [[thermal energy]]—and [[chemical energy]]—to [[mechanical energy]], which can then be used to do [[mechanical work]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamentals of Classical Thermodynamics'', 3rd ed. p. 159, (1985) by G. J. Van Wylen and R. E. Sonntag: "A heat engine may be defined as a device that operates in a thermodynamic cycle and does a certain amount of net positive work as a result of heat transfer from a high-[[temperature]] body and to a low-temperature body. Often the term heat engine is used in a broader sense to include all devices that produce work, either through heat transfer or combustion, even though the device does not operate in a thermodynamic cycle. The internal-combustion engine and the gas turbine are examples of such devices, and calling these heat engines is an acceptable use of the term."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mechanical efficiency of heat engines'', p. 1 (2007) by James R. Senf: "Heat engines are made to provide mechanical energy from thermal energy."&lt;/ref&gt; It does this by bringing a [[working substance]] from a higher state temperature to a lower state temperature. A heat source generates thermal energy that brings the working substance to the high temperature state. The working substance generates work in the [[Thermodynamic system|working body]] of the engine while [[Heat transfer|transferring heat]] to the colder [[Thermal reservoir|sink]] until it reaches a low temperature state. During this process some of the thermal energy is converted into [[energy|work]] by exploiting the properties of the working substance. The working substance can be any system with a non-zero [[heat capacity]], but it usually is a gas or liquid. During this process, a lot of heat is lost to the surroundings and so cannot be converted to work.

In general an [[engine]] converts energy to mechanical [[Work (physics)|work]]. Heat engines distinguish themselves from other types of engines by the fact that their efficiency is fundamentally limited by [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot's theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;''Thermal physics: entropy and free energies'', by Joon Chang Lee (2002), Appendix A, p. 183: "A heat engine absorbs energy from a heat source and then converts it into work for us.... When the engine absorbs heat energy, the absorbed heat energy comes with entropy." (heat energy &lt;math&gt;\Delta Q=T \Delta S&lt;/math&gt;), "When the engine performs work, on the other hand, no entropy leaves the engine. This is problematic. We would like the engine to repeat the process again and again to provide us with a steady work source. ... to do so, the working substance inside the engine must return to its initial thermodynamic condition after a cycle, which requires to remove the remaining entropy. The engine can do this only in one way. It must let part of the absorbed heat energy leave without converting it into work. Therefore the engine cannot convert all of the input energy into work!"&lt;/ref&gt; Although this efficiency limitation can be a drawback, an advantage of heat engines is that most forms of energy can be easily converted to heat by processes like [[exothermic reaction]]s (such as combustion), [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of light or energetic particles, [[friction]], [[dissipation]] and [[Electrical resistance|resistance]]. Since the heat source that supplies thermal energy to the engine can thus be powered by virtually any kind of energy, heat engines are very versatile and have a wide range of applicability.

Heat engines are often confused with the cycles they attempt to implement. Typically, the term "engine" is used for a physical device and "cycle" for the model.

==Overview==
[[Image:heat engine.png|300px|thumb|right|Figure 1: Heat engine diagram]]

In [[thermodynamics]], heat engines are often modeled using a standard engineering model such as the [[Otto cycle]]. The theoretical model can be refined and augmented with actual data from an operating engine, using tools such as an [[indicator diagram]]. Since very few actual implementations of heat engines exactly match their underlying thermodynamic cycles, one could say that a thermodynamic cycle is an ideal case of a mechanical engine. In any case, fully understanding an engine and its efficiency requires gaining a good understanding of the (possibly simplified or idealized) theoretical model, the practical nuances of an actual mechanical engine, and the discrepancies between the two.

In general terms, the larger the difference in temperature between the hot source and the cold sink, the larger is the potential [[thermal efficiency]] of the cycle. On Earth, the cold side of any heat engine is limited to being close to the ambient temperature of the environment, or not much lower than 300 [[kelvin]]s, so most efforts to improve the thermodynamic efficiencies of various heat engines focus on increasing the temperature of the source, within material limits. The maximum theoretical efficiency of a heat engine (which no engine ever attains) is equal to the temperature difference between the hot and cold ends divided by the temperature at the hot end, all expressed as [[absolute temperature]]s (in [[kelvin]]s).

The efficiency of various heat engines proposed or used today has a large range:

* 49% for a [[Supercritical steam generator|supercritical]] [[coal-fired power station]] such as the [[Avedøre Power Station]], and many others
* 60% for a steam-cooled [[combined cycle]] [[gas turbine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Efficiency by the Numbers| url=http://memagazine.asme.org/Web/Efficiency_by_Numbers.cfm| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616132320/http://memagazine.asme.org/Web/Efficiency_by_Numbers.cfm| archivedate=16 June 2009| last1=Langston| first1=Lee S.| publisher=ASME| deadurl=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All these processes gain their efficiency (or lack thereof) from the temperature drop across them. Significant energy may be used for auxiliary equipment, such as pumps, which effectively reduces efficiency.

===Power===
Heat engines can be characterized by their [[power density|specific power]], which is typically given in kilowatts per litre of [[engine displacement]] (in the U.S. also [[horsepower]] per cubic inch). The result offers an approximation of the peak power output of an engine. This is not to be confused with [[fuel efficiency]], since high efficiency often requires a lean fuel-air ratio, and thus lower power density. A modern high-performance car engine makes in excess of 75&amp;nbsp;kW/l (1.65&amp;nbsp;hp/in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

==Everyday examples==
Examples of everyday heat engines include the [[steam engine]] and the [[internal combustion engine]]. The [[stirling engine]] is also heat engine, as well as the [[drinking bird]] toy. All of these heat engines are powered by the expansion of heated gases.

==Examples of heat engines==
It is important to note that although some cycles have a typical combustion location (internal or external), they often can be implemented with the other. For example, [[John Ericsson]]&lt;ref name="hae-ericsson1833"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotairengines.org/stirling-engines-inventors/ericsson/the-engine-of-1833|title=Ericsson's 1833 caloric engine|work=hotairengines.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed an external heated engine running on a cycle very much like the earlier [[Diesel cycle]]. In addition, externally heated engines can often be implemented in open or closed cycles.

=== Earth's heat engine ===
Earth's atmosphere and hydrosphere—Earth’s heat engine—are coupled processes that constantly even out solar heating imbalances through evaporation of surface water, convection, rainfall, winds, and ocean circulation, when distributing heat around the globe.&lt;ref name="Lindsey 2009"&gt;{{cite journal

The Hadley system provides an example of a heat engine. The Hadley circulation is identified with rising of warm and moist air in the equatorial region with descent of colder air in the subtropics corresponding to a thermally driven direct circulation, with consequent net production of kinetic energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Junling Huang and Michael B. McElroy|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00538.1|title=Contributions of the Hadley and Ferrel Circulations to the Energetics of the Atmosphere over the Past 32 Years|journal=Journal of Climate |issue=7| volume=27 |pages=2656–2666 |year=2014 |doi=10.1175/jcli-d-13-00538.1|bibcode = 2014JCli...27.2656H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase-change cycles===
In these cycles and engines, the working fluids are gases and liquids.  The engine converts the working fluid from a gas to a liquid, from liquid to gas, or both, generating work from the fluid expansion or compression.
* [[Rankine cycle]] (classical [[steam engine]])
* [[Regenerative cycle]] ([[steam engine]] more efficient than [[Rankine cycle]])
* [[Organic Rankine cycle]] (Coolant changing phase in temperature ranges of ice and hot liquid water)
* Vapor to liquid cycle ([[Drinking bird]], [[Injector]], [[Minto wheel]])
* Liquid to solid cycle ([[Frost heaving]] — water changing from ice to liquid and back again can lift rock up to 60&amp;nbsp;cm.)
* Solid to gas cycle ([[Dry ice cannon]] — Dry ice sublimes to gas.)

===Gas-only cycles===
In these cycles and engines the working fluid is always a gas (i.e., there is no phase change):
* [[Carnot cycle]] ([[Carnot heat engine]])
* [[Ericsson cycle]] (Caloric Ship John Ericsson)
* [[Stirling cycle]] ([[Stirling engine]]&lt;ref name="hae-stirling1842"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotairengines.org/stirling-engines-inventors/stirling/the-stirling-engine-of-1842|title=Stirling's 1842 air engine|work=hotairengines.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Thermoacoustic refrigeration|thermoacoustic]] devices)
* [[Internal combustion engine]] (ICE):
** [[Otto cycle]] (e.g. [[Gasoline/Petrol engine]])
** [[Diesel cycle]] (e.g. [[Diesel engine]])
** [[Atkinson cycle]] (Atkinson engine)
** [[Brayton cycle]] or [[Joule cycle]] originally [[Ericsson cycle]] ([[gas turbine]])
** [[Lenoir cycle]] (e.g., [[pulse jet engine]])
** [[Miller cycle]] (Miller engine)

===Liquid only cycle===
In these cycles and engines the working fluid are always like liquid:
* [[Stirling cycle]] ([[Malone engine]])
* Heat Regenerative Cyclone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclonepower.com/works.html |title=Cyclone Power Technologies Website |publisher=Cyclonepower.com |accessdate=2012-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119094540/http://www.cyclonepower.com/works.html |archivedate=19 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electron cycles===
* [[Johnson thermoelectric energy converter]]
* Thermoelectric ([[Peltier–Seebeck effect]])
* [[Thermogalvanic cell]]
* [[Thermionic emission]]
* [[Thermotunnel cooling]]

===Magnetic cycles===
* [[Thermo-magnetic motor]] (Tesla)

===Cycles used for refrigeration===
{{main article|refrigeration}}
A domestic [[refrigerator]] is an example of a [[heat pump]]: a heat engine in reverse. Work is used to create a heat differential. Many cycles can run in reverse to move heat from the cold side to the hot side, making the cold side cooler and the hot side hotter. Internal combustion engine versions of these cycles are, by their nature, not reversible.

Refrigeration cycles include:
* [[Vapor-compression refrigeration]]
* [[Stirling engine#Stirling cryocoolers|Stirling cryocoolers]]
* [[Gas-absorption refrigerator]]
* [[Air cycle machine]]
* [[Vuilleumier refrigeration]]
* [[Magnetic refrigeration]]

===Evaporative heat engines===
The [[Barton evaporation engine]] is a heat engine based on a cycle producing power and cooled moist air from the evaporation of water into hot dry air.

===Mesoscopic heat engines===
Mesoscopic heat engines are nanoscale devices that may serve the goal of processing heat fluxes and perform useful work at small scales. Potential applications include e.g. electric cooling devices.
In such mesoscopic heat engines, work per cycle of operation fluctuates due to thermal noise.
There is exact equality that relates average of exponents of work performed by any heat engine and the heat transfer from the hotter heat bath.&lt;ref name='sinitsyn-11jpa'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fluctuation Relation for Heat Engines|author=N. A. Sinitsyn |journal=J. Phys. A: Math. Theor.|volume=44|year=2011|page=405001|doi=10.1088/1751-8113/44/40/405001|arxiv = 1111.7014 |bibcode = 2011JPhA...44N5001S }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- N.A. Sinitsyn 2011 JPA ''44''' 405001 --&gt; This relation transforms the Carnot's inequality into exact equality.

==Efficiency==
The efficiency of a heat engine relates how much useful work is output for a given amount of heat energy input.

From the laws of [[thermodynamics]], after a completed cycle:

:&lt;math&gt; W \ = \ Q_c \ - \ (-Q_h) &lt;/math&gt;
:where
:&lt;math&gt; W = -\oint PdV &lt;/math&gt; is the work extracted from the engine. (It is negative since work is ''done by'' the engine.)
:&lt;math&gt; Q_h = T_h\Delta S_h &lt;/math&gt; is the heat energy taken from the high temperature system. (It is negative since heat is extracted from the source, hence &lt;math&gt;(-Q_h)&lt;/math&gt; is positive.)
:&lt;math&gt; Q_c = T_c\Delta S_c &lt;/math&gt; is the heat energy delivered to the cold temperature system. (It is positive since heat is added to the sink.)

In other words, a heat engine absorbs heat energy from the high temperature heat source, converting part of it to useful work and delivering the rest to the cold temperature heat sink.

In general, the efficiency of a given heat transfer process (whether it be a refrigerator, a heat pump or an engine) is defined informally by the ratio of "what you get out" to "what you put in".

In the case of an engine, one desires to extract work and puts in a heat transfer.

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac{-W}{-Q_h} = \frac{-Q_h - Q_c}{-Q_h} = 1 - \frac{Q_c}{-Q_h}&lt;/math&gt;

The ''theoretical'' maximum efficiency of any heat engine depends only on the temperatures it operates between. This efficiency is usually derived using an ideal imaginary heat engine such as the [[Carnot heat engine]], although other engines using different cycles can also attain maximum efficiency. Mathematically, this is because in [[Thermodynamic reversibility|reversible]] processes, the change in [[entropy]] of the cold reservoir is the negative of that of the hot reservoir (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\Delta S_c = -\Delta S_h&lt;/math&gt;), keeping the overall change of entropy zero. Thus:

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_\text{max} = 1 - \frac{T_c \Delta S_c}{-T_h \Delta S_h} = 1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T_h&lt;/math&gt; is the [[absolute temperature]] of the hot source and &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; that of the cold sink, usually measured in [[kelvin]]s. Note that &lt;math&gt;dS_c&lt;/math&gt; is positive while &lt;math&gt;dS_h&lt;/math&gt; is negative; in any reversible work-extracting process, entropy is overall not increased, but rather is moved from a hot (high-entropy) system to a cold (low-entropy one), decreasing the entropy of the heat source and increasing that of the heat sink.

The reasoning behind this being the '''maximal''' efficiency goes as follows. It is first assumed that if a more efficient heat engine than a Carnot engine is possible, then it could be driven in reverse as a heat pump. Mathematical analysis can be used to show that this assumed combination would result in a net decrease in [[entropy]]. Since, by the [[second law of thermodynamics]], this is statistically improbable to the point of exclusion, the Carnot efficiency is a theoretical upper bound on the reliable efficiency of ''any'' thermodynamic cycle.

Empirically, no heat engine has ever been shown to run at a greater efficiency than a Carnot cycle heat engine.

Figure 2 and Figure 3 show variations on Carnot cycle efficiency. Figure 2 indicates how efficiency changes with an increase in the heat addition temperature for a constant compressor inlet temperature. Figure 3 indicates how the efficiency changes with an increase in the heat rejection temperature for a constant turbine inlet temperature.

===Endoreversible heat engines===
The most Carnot efficiency as a criterion of heat engine performance is the fact that by its nature, any maximally efficient Carnot cycle must operate at an infinitesimal temperature gradient. This is because ''any'' transfer of heat between two bodies at differing temperatures is irreversible, and therefore the Carnot efficiency expression only applies in the infinitesimal limit. The major problem with that is that the object of most heat engines is to output some sort of power, and infinitesimal power is usually not what is being sought.

A different measure of ideal heat engine efficiency is given by considerations of [[endoreversible thermodynamics]], where the cycle is identical to the Carnot cycle except in that the two processes of heat transfer are ''not'' reversible (Callen 1985):

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = 1 - \sqrt{\frac{T_c}{T_h}}&lt;/math&gt; (Note: Units [[kelvin|K]] or [[Rankine scale|°R]])

This model does a better job of predicting how well real-world heat engines can do (Callen 1985, see also [[endoreversible thermodynamics]]):

As shown, the endoreversible efficiency much more closely models the observed.

==History==
{{Main article|Timeline of heat engine technology}}
{{See also|History of the internal combustion engine|History of thermodynamics}}

Heat engines have been known since antiquity but were only made into useful devices at the time of the industrial revolution in the 18th century. They continue to be developed today.

==Heat engine enhancements==
Engineers have studied the various heat engine cycles extensively in effort to improve the amount of usable work they could extract from a given power source. The Carnot cycle limit cannot be reached with any gas-based cycle, but engineers have worked out at least two ways to possibly go around that limit, and one way to get better efficiency without bending any rules.
# Increase the temperature difference in the heat engine. The simplest way to do this is to increase the hot side temperature, which is the approach used in modern combined-cycle [[gas turbine]]s. Unfortunately, physical limits (such as the melting point of the materials used to build the engine) and environmental concerns regarding [[NOx|NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]] production restrict the maximum temperature on workable heat engines. Modern gas turbines run at temperatures as high as possible within the range of temperatures necessary to maintain acceptable NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; output {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. Another way of increasing efficiency is to lower the output temperature. One new method of doing so is to use mixed chemical working fluids, and then exploit the changing behavior of the mixtures. One of the most famous is the so-called [[Kalina cycle]], which uses a 70/30 mix of [[ammonia]] and water as its working fluid. This mixture allows the cycle to generate useful power at considerably lower temperatures than most other processes.
# Exploit the physical properties of the working fluid. The most common such exploitation is the use of water above the so-called critical point, or so-called supercritical steam. The behavior of fluids above their critical point changes radically, and with materials such as water and [[carbon dioxide]] it is possible to exploit those changes in behavior to extract greater thermodynamic efficiency from the heat engine, even if it is using a fairly conventional Brayton or Rankine cycle. A newer and very promising material for such applications is [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. [[Sulfur dioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[xenon]] have also been considered for such applications, although SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is toxic.
# Exploit the chemical properties of the working fluid. A fairly new and novel exploit is to use exotic working fluids with advantageous chemical properties. One such is [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a toxic component of smog, which has a natural [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]] as di-nitrogen tetraoxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). At low temperature, the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is compressed and then heated. The increasing temperature causes each N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to break apart into two NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. This lowers the molecular weight of the working fluid, which drastically increases the efficiency of the cycle. Once the NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has expanded through the turbine, it is cooled by the [[heat sink]], which makes it recombine into N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. This is then fed back by the compressor for another cycle. Such species as [[aluminium bromide]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), NOCl, and Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; have all been investigated for such uses. To date, their drawbacks have not warranted their use, despite the efficiency gains that can be realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mragheb/www/NPRE%20402%20ME%20405%20Nuclear%20Power%20Engineering/Nuclear%20Reactors%20Concepts%20and%20Thermodynamic%20Cycles.pdf |title=Nuclear Reactors Concepts and Thermodynamic Cycles |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318233007/https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mragheb/www/NPRE%20402%20ME%20405%20Nuclear%20Power%20Engineering/Nuclear%20Reactors%20Concepts%20and%20Thermodynamic%20Cycles.pdf |archivedate=18 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kashmir]] has been a disputed and divided territory with human rights abuses in both the section administered by India ([[Jammu and Kashmir]]) and that administered by Pakistan ([[Azad Kashmir]] and [[Gilgit-Baltistan]]). 
[[Kashmir conflict|The dispute]] began in 1947 with [[partition of India|the partition of the British Indian Empire]] into India and Pakistan.

===Line of Control===
The [[Line of Control]] (LOC) is a military control line between Indian and Pakistani-controlled parts of Kashmir. The line does not constitute a legally international boundary but it is a [[de facto]] border, designated in 1948 as a cease-fire line, it divided Kashmir into two parts and closed the Jehlum valley route, the only entrance of the [[Kashmir Valley]]. This territorial division which, to this day still exists severed many villages and separated family members from each other.&lt;ref&gt;Ranjan Kumar Singh, '''Sarhad: Zero Mile''', (Hindi), ''Parijat Prakashan'', {{ISBN|81-903561-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="loc kashmir"&gt;{{cite book | author=Women in Security, Conflict Management, a Peace (Program) | title=Closer to ourselves: stories from the journ towards peace in South Asia | url=https://books.google.com/books?q=line+of+control+separated+villages+families+relatives+in+kashmir&amp;btnG=Search+Books | accessdate=27 December 2012 |year=2008 | publisher=WISCOMP, Foundation for Universal Responsibility of His Holiness the Dalai Lam 2008 | isbn= | page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[landmines]] planted by the [[Army]] alongsides of the line have killed scores of innocent people and left thousands as disabled.

==== Militants====

The rapes by Islamic militants have been reported since the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]]. On 22 October 1947, Pashtun militants invaded [[Baramulla]] in a Pakistan army truck, and raped women including European nuns.&lt;ref name="Pochhammer1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilhelm von Pochhammer|title=India's road to nationhood: a political history of the subcontinent|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mHLB4m75pisC&amp;pg=PA512|accessdate=10 March 2012|year=1981|publisher=Allied Publishers|isbn=978-81-7764-715-0|pages=512–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1990, the wife of a BSF inspector was kidnapped, tortured and gang-raped for many days.

Since 1991, reports of rape by Islamic militants have increased, and there have been many cases of the militants threatening to kill the family unless a woman is handed over to the militants. According to the HRW, the rape victims of militants suffer ostracism and there is a "code of silence and fear" that prevents people from reporting such abuse. According to the HRW, the investigation of case of rape by militants is difficult because many Kashmiris are reluctant to discuss it for the fear of violent reprisals.&lt;ref name="HumanRightsCrisis"&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/INDIA937.PDF The Human Rights Crisis in Kashmir].

The increase in number of rape cases has resulted in an increased number of abortions, leading to one case of murder of doctor. The doctor was accused of being an informer by the Islamic groups Hezb-ul Mujahidin and Al Jehad.&lt;ref name="HumanRightsCrisis" /&gt;

According to a report published by ''Asia Watch'': {{quote|In Kashmir, the militant forces do not control territory and their military operations are generally characterised by ambushes of government forces and hit-and-run attacks for which they rely on weapons such as AK-47s, grenades, mines and other small arms.

According to a resolution passed by the [[United States Congress]] in 2006, Islamic terrorists infiltrated the region in 1989 and forced most of the Kashmiri Pandits to flee Kashmir.

The killing had led to widespread protests in the district.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/943921 Killing of youth in GB by-polls condemned], ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', 2009-12-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Large protests erupted during the [[February 2012 Kohistan Killings]] where 18 people were ordered off from a bus and killed by gunmen on the Islamabad-Gilgit route. The act drew condemnation from the [[UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-12854-Tension-prevails-in-GB-after-Kohistan-killings |title=Tension prevails in GB after Kohistan killings |publisher=Thenews.com.pk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gilgit-Baltistan===

The main demand of the people of Gilgit-Baltistan is a constitutional status to the region as a fifth province of Pakistan.&lt;ref name = indian_express&gt;{{cite web|author=Nadeem|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/gilgitbaltistan-a-question-of-autonomy/519428/1 |title=Gilgit-Baltistan: A question of autonomy |publisher=Indian Express |date=2009-09-21 |accessdate=2012-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = gilgit_polls /&gt; However, Pakistan claims that Gilgit-Baltistan cannot be given constitutional status due to Pakistan's commitment to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 47|the 1948 UN resolution]].&lt;ref name=gilgit_polls/&gt;&lt;ref name=dawn_gilgit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.dawn.com/archives/30198 |title=DAWN: Gilgit-Baltistan autonomy |publisher=Archives.dawn.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601035500/http://archives.dawn.com/archives/30198 |archivedate=1 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[International Crisis Group]] stated that "Almost six decades after Pakistan's independence, the constitutional status of the Federally Administered Northern Areas (Gilgit and Baltistan), once part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and now under Pakistani control, remains undetermined, with political autonomy a distant dream. The region's inhabitants are embittered by Islamabad's unwillingness to devolve powers in real terms to its elected representatives. The rise of sectarian extremism is an alarming consequence of this denial of basic political rights".&lt;ref name=DAWN20090726&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/in-paper-magazine/encounter/political-unrest-in-gilgitbaltistan-679 Political unrest in Gilgit-Baltistan], ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', 2009-07-26&lt;/ref&gt; A two-day conference on Gilgit-Baltistan was held on 8–9 April 2008 at the European Parliament in [[Brussels]] under the auspices of the International Kashmir Alliance.&lt;ref name=thaindian10037588&gt;[http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/uncategorized/european-mps-concerned-at-rights-violations-in-pakistani-kashmir_10037588.html European MPs concerned at rights violations in Pakistani Kashmir], ''Thaindian News'', 2008-04-13&lt;/ref&gt; Several members of the [[European Parliament]] expressed concern over the human rights violation in Gilgit-Baltistan and urged the government of Pakistan to establish democratic institutions and rule of law in the area.&lt;ref name=thaindian10037588/&gt;&lt;ref name=indianexpress556767&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/link-aid-to-pak-with-effort-in-checking-terr/556767/ European Parliament concerned on Gilgit-Baltistan], ''[[The Indian Express|Indian Express]]'', 2009-12-20&lt;/ref&gt;
	
In 2009, the Pakistan government implemented an autonomy package for Gilgit-Baltistan which entails rights similar to those of Pakistan’s other provinces.&lt;ref name = indian_express/&gt; Gilgit-Baltistan thus gains province-like status without actually being conferred such a status constitutionally.&lt;ref name = indian_express/&gt;&lt;ref name = dawn_gilgit/&gt; The direct rule by Islamabad is replaced by an elected legislative assembly and its chief minister.&lt;ref name = indian_express/&gt;&lt;ref name = dawn_gilgit/&gt;

Since that time, various scholars have examined the intersection between dimensions of identity and tourism. An important early contribution to the study of identity tourism was Lanfant, Allcock and Bruner's 1995 edited volume "International Tourism, Identity and Change".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uk.sagepub.com/books/Book204567/title "International Tourism, Identity and Change"]. Retrieved on February 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; As with the Keyes and van den Berghe special issue of Annals of Tourism Research, this volume moved us away from studying the impact of tourism on identity to investigating the intersection of tourism and identity in more dynamic ways, among other things looking at how "local" and "tourist" identities are mutually-constructed. Likewise, Michel Picard and Robert Wood's path-breaking edited volume "Tourism, Ethnicity and the State in Asian and Pacific Societies" (1997, University of Hawaii Press), examined the ways in which tourism intersections with ethnic, cultural, regional and national identities, as well as with the political agendas of Pacific island and Southeast Asian states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/p-422-9780824819118.aspx "Tourism, Ethnicity, and the State in Asian and Pacific Societies"].

Among other things the chapters in their volume investigated tourists' views of themselves and others in the course of their travels, the relationship of travelers to resident populations, and the ways in which tourists' quests for authenticity are entangled with their own sensibilities about their own identities.

Various case studies of tourism and identity merit mention here. Edward Bruner's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://anthro.illinois.edu/directory/profile/ebruner|title=Edward M Bruner - Anthropology at Illinois|website=anthro.illinois.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2001 article "The Masai and the Lion King: Authenticity, Nationalism and Globalization in African Tourism"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|accessdate=February 18, 2014|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ae.2001.28.4.881/abstract|doi=10.1525/ae.2001.28.4.881|title=The Maasai and the Lion King: Authenticity, Nationalism, and Globalization in African Tourism|journal=American Ethnologist|volume=28|issue=4|pages=881|author=Edward M. Bruner|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a penetrating examination of how various Kenyan tourist sites entail displays of particular identities ("Masai" "Colonialist" etc.) and how tourists' engagements with these identity displays are varied, nuanced and complex, articulating with their own narratives, sensibilities about African heritage and quests. [[Kathleen M. Adams]]' 2006 work on tourism, identity and the arts in Toraja, Indonesia illustrates how tourism is drawn upon by different members of the community to elaborate different dimensions of identity. In "Art as Politics: Re-crafting tourism, identities and power in Tana Toraja, Indonesia",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/p-9780824830724.aspx "Art as Politics: Re-crafting tourism, identities and power in Tana Toraja, Indonesia"]. Retrieved on February 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Adams documents how tourism challenges older elite identities in the community, reconfiguring artistic and ritual symbols once associated with elites as broader symbols of Toraja ethnic group identity.

== Cyberspace ==
The emergence of the internet as a venue of identity expression is also relevant to the theme of tourism and identity. A 2011 edited volume on [http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/p-4431-9780824830724.aspx Tourism Social Media: Transformations in Identity, Community and Culture] by hospitality and business school scholars spotlights some of these issues, as    Moreover, there are various programs and applications, such as chat rooms, forums, MUDs, MOOs, MMORPGs, and others in which a user is allowed to establish an identity in that particular space. This online identity could be different from a user's physical identity in race, gender, height, weight or even species. In chat rooms and forums, a user creates their identity through text and the way they interact with others. In MMORPGs, users create a visual representation of their identity, an avatar. This allows users to easily tour more than just ethnic and cultural identities.

With the development of the internet and virtual reality, identity tourism can become more salient than previously thought. With virtual reality, for example, those who identify as transgender could create that identity in an MMORPG or forum.  [[Lisa Nakamura]]&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, L. (2000). [http://www.humanities.uci.edu/mposter/syllabi/readings/nakamura.html ''Race In/For Cyberspace: Identity Tourism and Racial Passing on the Internet.''] Retrieved on October 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; has studied identity tourism in cyberspace, using it to describe the process of appropriating an identity involving another gender and/or race than one's own on the web. She describes the process as an avenue through which cultural, ethnic, and racial differences are commodified, stereotyped, and neglected. This kind of cyber-identity tourism mainly refers to the web but also touch other media forms, such as [[video games]].&lt;ref&gt;Flew, T. and Humphreys, S. (2005). "Games: Technology, Industry, Culture." ''New Media: An Introduction'', Oxford University Press, South Melbourne 101–114.&lt;/ref&gt; Being able to 'tour' the internet with a new identity opens the possibility of the net being an identifiable space.

An '''intellectual''' is a person who engages in [[critical thinking]], [[research]], and [[Human self-reflection|reflection]] about society and proposes solutions for its [[normative]] problems, and gain [[Authority (sociology)|authority]] as public intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Fontana dictionary of Modern Thought''.

"The Century of the Intellectual: From Dreyfus to Salman Rushdie", ''Intellectuals in Politics'', Routledge: New York (1997) p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Coming from the world of [[culture]], either as a creator or as a mediator, the intellectual participates in politics either to defend a concrete proposition or to denounce an injustice, usually by rejecting, producing or extending an [[ideology]], and by defending a system of [[value theory|values]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pascal Ory]] and Jean-François Sirinelli, ''Les Intellectuels en France. De l'affaire Dreyfus à nos jours'' (''The Intellectuals in France: From the Dreyfus Affair to Our Days''), Paris: Armand Colin, 2002, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Socially, intellectuals constitute the [[intelligentsia]], a [[Status group|status class]] organised either by [[ideology]] ([[Conservatism|conservative]], [[Fascism|fascist]], [[Socialism|socialist]], [[Liberalism|liberal]], [[reactionary]], [[revolution]]ary, [[Democracy|democratic]], [[Communism|communist]] intellectuals, ''et al.''), or by nationality (American intellectuals, French intellectuals, Ibero–American intellectuals, ''et al.''). The contemporary intellectual class originated from the ''intelligentsiya'' of [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]] ({{circa|1860s}}–1870s), the [[Social stratification|social stratum]] of those possessing intellectual formation (schooling, education, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), and who were Russian society's counterpart to the German ''Bildungsbürgertum'' and to the French ''bourgeoisie éclairée'', the [[Bourgeoisie|enlightened middle classes]] of those realms.&lt;ref name="Williams, Raymond 1983 pp. 169"&gt;Williams, Raymond. ''Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society'' (1983), pp. 169–71.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In ''[[The Twilight of Atheism]]'' (2004, p. 53), the theologian [[Alister McGrath]] said that "the emergence of a socially alienated, theologically literate, anti-establishment lay intelligentsia is one of the more significant phenomena of the social history of Germany in the 1830s ... three or four theological graduates in ten might hope to find employment in a Church post". In the essay, "The High Enlightenment and the Low-Life of Literature", the cultural historian [[Robert Darnton]] said that the politically radical thinkers who had participated in the French Revolution (1789–1799), were not social outsiders, rather they were respectable, domesticated, and assimilated men. (pp. 1–40.) ''[[Grub Street in France|The Literary Underground of the Old Régime]]'', 1982.}}

In the late 19th century, amidst the [[Dreyfus affair]] (1894–1906), an identity crisis of [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]] nationalism for the [[French Third Republic]] (1870–1940), the [[reactionary]] anti–Dreyfusards ([[Maurice Barrès]], [[Ferdinand Brunetière]], ''et al.'') used the terms ''intellectual'' and ''the intellectuals'' to deride the liberal Dreyfusards ([[Émile Zola]], [[Octave Mirbeau]], [[Anatole France]], ''et al.'') as political dilettantes from the realms of French culture, art, and science, who had become involved in politics, by publicly advocating for the exoneration and liberation of [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a Jewish French artillery captain falsely accused of betraying France to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, Hannah. ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'', Second Edition. (1958) pp. 89–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, the term ''Intellectual'' acquired positive connotations of [[Reputation|social prestige]], derived from possessing [[intellectualism|intellect]] and [[intelligence]], especially when the intellectual's activities exerted positive consequences in the [[public sphere]] and so increased the intellectual understanding of the public, by means of [[Morality|moral]] responsibility, [[altruism]], and [[solidarity]], without resorting to the [[psychological manipulation|manipulations]] of [[demagoguery]], [[paternalism]], and [[incivility]] (condescension).&lt;ref name="Williams, Raymond 1983 pp. 169"/&gt;{{efn|In the newspaper column, "Pilot Fish Among Sharks" (''El País'', 14 June 2014), the Spanish philosopher of ethics [[Fernando Savater|Fernando Fernández-Savater Martín]] explained the social function of the public intellectual with an anecdote about the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] philosopher [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], at whose public conferences, in different cities, there always was present the same uneducated woman, who answered his query about her presence, by saying: "It's just that I like to listen to you, because you speak to us as if we were all intelligent."&lt;poem&gt;

Effectively so, that is precisely the specific function of the intellectual: To treat everyone else as if they, too, were intellectuals. That is to say, to not attempt to hypnotise them, to intimidate them, or to seduce them, but to awaken in them the mechanism of intelligence that weighs, evaluates, and comprehends. One must start from the Socratic premise that everyone in the world reveals himself, herself intelligent when treated as if intelligent. Is that social function compatible with the offices of politicians? Because, more often than not, they tend to govern themselves by the cynical principle that: "One must not treat the public as if they were imbeciles, nor forget that they are imbeciles", which was established by the novelist [[Frédéric Beigbeder]] (who, not in vain, began his career as an advertising man); it is plainly obvious that those are opposite approaches. What is bad, is that the first approach demands effort from the interlocutors—attention, reflection, and dubious sizings-up, while the second approach flatters the primitive emotions of enthusiasm or revenge, and converts critical thinking to satire or to swearing curses, and social problems into notorious scandal... .

Of course, the advocates of [[Atavism|atavistic]] formulas periodically return to the charge, because those emotional formulas are easily assumed out of ignorance (populism, as you already know, is democracy for the mentally lazy), and, as such, are more necessary than ever; thus, if there be no intellectuals in politics, at the least, there should be intellectual ethos in public and in social discourse. Nonetheless, the lesson of personal experience often is negative, and the honest intellectuals whom I know always have returned crestfallen [from politics], like the pioneer Plato returned from Syracuse... ."&lt;ref&gt;[http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2014/06/13/actualidad/1402681916_575638.html ''Peces piloto entre tiburones''], el País, 15 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}} Hence, for the educated person of a society, participating in the public sphere—the political affairs of the city-state—is a civic responsibility dating from the [[Classical antiquity|Græco–Latin Classical era]]:

{{Quotation|align=center|I am a human; I reckon nothing human to be foreign to me. (''Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum puto''.) |''[[Heauton Timorumenos|The Self-Tormentor]]'' (163&amp;nbsp;BC), [[Terence]]&lt;ref&gt;Howatson, M.C. (Ed.) ''The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature'', Second Edition. Oxford University Press. 1993. "Heau'ton timōrū'menos", 77, pp. 260–61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://linguistlist.org/issues/4/4-1053.html|title=LINGUIST List 4.1053: Jakobson quotation|author=|date=|website=linguistlist.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The determining factor for ''a Thinker'' (historian, philosopher, scientist, writer, artist, ''et al.'') to be considered a public intellectual is the degree to which he or she is [[Logical consequence|implicated]] and [[Engaged theory|engaged]] with the vital reality of the contemporary world; that is to say, participation in the public affairs of society. Consequently, being designated as a public intellectual is determined by the degree of influence of the designator's [[motivation]]s, opinions, and options of action (social, political, ideological), and by affinity with the given thinker; therefore:{{efn|In the essay "[[Existentialism is a Humanism]]" (1946), Jean-Paul Sartre explains the philosophical concepts of [[Logical consequence|implication]] and [[Engaged theory|engagement]]. In ''Notas para una lectura'' (''Notes for a Lecture''), the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] philosopher [[:ca:Ramon Alcoberro i Pericay|Ramón Alcoberro i Pericay]] explains Sartre's opinion of not being engaged with one's times, and the consequent implications: ... once one comprehends his [Sartre's] idea of "Man as Situation", it is easier to understand the concepts of "responsibility" and "engagement". To become engaged in a concrete situation—"to become embarked", said [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]]—is the consequence of presuming that one cannot live in pure, conceptual abstraction; everyone always is in a given "situation", and it corresponds to us to be responsible (to respond) to that situation; simply put, neutrality is not possible. In an editorial opinion in ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'', in 1945, Sartre wrote, "I consider [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]] and the [[Goncourt brothers|Brothers Goncourt]] responsible for the [[Political repression|repression]] that followed the [[Paris Commune|Commune]], because they never wrote, even a line, to impede it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alcoberro.info/planes/sartre3.htm|title=Sartre. El existencialismo es un humanismo|author=|date=|website=www.alcoberro.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; See: ''[[What Is literature?|What is Literature?]]'' (1947)}}

{{Quotation|align=center|The Intellectual is someone who meddles in what does not concern them. (''L'intellectuel est quelqu'un qui se mêle de ce qui ne le regarde pas''.)|[[Jean-Paul Sartre]]&lt;ref&gt;Annie Cohen-Solal, ''Sartre'', Gallimard, 1989, pp. 588–89.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Analogously, the application and the conceptual value of the terms ''Intellectual'' and ''the Intellectuals'' are socially negative when the practice of [[Intellectualism|intellectuality]] is exclusively in service to [[The Establishment]] who wield [[Power (social and political)|power]] in a society, as such:

[https://books.google.com/books?id=cEzG68PlBl4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Noam+Chomsky+Peter+R.+Mitchell+John+Schoeffel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mLlfTujyE-z34QTs-2E&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=intelectual%20disidencia&amp;f=false ''Chomsky''], Crítica, 2002, {{ISBN|8484323781}}, pg. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Noam Chomsky's negative view of the Establishment Intellectual suggests the existence of another kind of intellectual one might call "the public intellectual," which is:

{{Quotation|... someone able to speak the truth, a ... courageous and angry individual for whom no worldly power is too big and imposing to be criticised and pointedly taken to task. The real or true intellectual is therefore always an outsider, living in self-imposed exile, and on the margins of society. He or she speaks to, as well as for, a public, necessarily in public, and is properly on the side of the dispossessed, the un-represented and the forgotten.|[[Edward Said|Edward Saïd]]&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, Jeremy and Kemp–Welch, Anthony. (Eds.) ''Intellectuals in Politics: From the Dreyfus Affair to Salman Rushdie'', 1997. pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Terms and endeavours==
The intellectual is a type of intelligent person, who is associated with [[reason]] and [[critical thinking]]. Many everyday roles require the application of intelligence to skills that may have a [[Psychomotor learning|psychomotor]] component, for example, in the fields of medicine or the arts, but these do not necessarily involve the practitioner in the "world of ideas". The distinctive quality of the intellectual person is that the mental skills, which one demonstrates, are not simply intelligent, but even more, they focus on thinking about the abstract, philosophical and [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] aspects of human inquiry and the value of their thinking.{{Citation needed|reason=sounds elitist|date=October 2013}}

The intellectual and the [[Scholarly method|scholarly]] classes are related; the intellectual usually is not a teacher involved in the production of [[Scholarly method|scholarship]], but has an academic background, and works in a profession, practices an art, or a science. The intellectual person is one who applies [[critical thinking]] and reason in either a professional or a personal capacity, and so has [[authority]] in the public sphere of their society; the term ''intellectual'' identifies three types of person, one who:

# is [[erudition|erudite]], and develops abstract ideas and theories
# a professional who produces [[cultural capital]], as in [[philosophy]], [[literary criticism]], [[sociology]], [[law]],  [[medicine]], [[science]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Knowledge and Decisions|last=Sowell|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Sowell|year=1980|publisher=Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
# an [[artist]] who [[Writing|writes]], [[Musical composition|composes]], [[Painting|paints]], etc.

==="Man of letters"===
{{anchor|Man of Letters}}
The term "man of letters" derives from the French term ''[[Belles-lettres|belletrist]]'' or ''homme de lettres'' but is not synonymous with "an academic".&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford English Reference Dictionary'' Second Edition, (1996) p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New Cassel's French–English, English–French Dictionary'' (1962) p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; A "man of letters" was a literate man ("able to read and write") as opposed to an [[illiterate]] man, in a time when [[literacy]] was a rare form of cultural capital. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the ''Belletrists'' were the ''literati'', the French "citizens of the [[Republic of Letters]]", which evolved into the [[salon (gathering)|salon]], a social institution, usually run by a hostess, meant for the edification, education, and cultural refinement of the participants.

==Historical background==
In English, the term ''intellectual'' identifies a "literate thinker"; its earlier usage, as in the book title ''The Evolution of an Intellectual'' (1920), by [[John Middleton Murry]], denotes literary activity, rather than the activities of the public intellectual.&lt;ref&gt;Collini p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th-century===
[[File:J’accuse.jpg|thumb|upright|The front page of ''[[L'Aurore (1944 newspaper)|L'Aurore]]'' (13 January 1898) featured [[Émile Zola]]'s open letter, ''[[J'Accuse…!]]'', asking the French President, [[Félix Faure]], to resolve the [[Dreyfus affair]].]]

====Britain====
In the late 19th century, when literacy was relatively common in European countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], the "Man of Letters" (''littérateur'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Littérateur, n. |title=Discover the Story of English|edition=Second (1989)|date=June 2012|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/109241 |publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|orig-year=First published in New English Dictionary, 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; denotation broadened to mean "specialized", a man who earned his living writing intellectually (not creatively) about literature: the [[essay]]ist, the [[journalist]], the [[critic]], et al. In the 20th century, such an approach was gradually superseded by the academic method, and the term "Man of Letters" became disused, replaced by the generic term "intellectual", describing the intellectual person. In late 19th century, the term ''intellectual'' became common usage to denote the defenders of the falsely accused artillery officer [[Alfred Dreyfus]].&lt;ref&gt;Gross (1969); see also Pierson (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Continental Europe====
In early 19th century Britain, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] coined the term ''clerisy'', the intellectual class responsible for upholding and maintaining the national culture, the secular equivalent of the Anglican clergy. Likewise, in [[Tsar]]ist Russia, there arose the ''[[intelligentsia]]'' (1860s–70s), who were the [[Status group|status class]] of [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] workers. The theologian [[Alister McGrath]] said that "the emergence of a socially alienated, [[theology|theologically]] literate, antiestablishment lay intelligentsia is one of the more significant phenomena of the social history of [[Germany]] in the 1830s", and that "three or four theological graduates in ten might hope to find employment" in a church post.&lt;ref&gt;''The Twilight of Atheism'' (2004), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, politically radical thinkers already had participated in the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799); [[Robert Darnton]] said that they were not societal outsiders, but "respectable, domesticated, and assimilated".&lt;ref&gt;From "The High Enlightenment and the Low-Life of Literature", in ''The Literary Underground of the Old Regime'' (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

Thenceforth, in Europe, an intellectual class was socially important, especially to self-styled intellectuals, whose participation in society's arts, politics, journalism, and education—of either [[Nationalism|nationalist]], [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]], or ethnic sentiment—constitute "vocation of the intellectual". Moreover, some intellectuals were anti-academic, despite universities (the Academy) being synonymous with [[intellectualism]].

In France, the [[Dreyfus affair]] marked the full emergence of the "intellectual in public life", especially [[Émile Zola]], [[Octave Mirbeau]], and [[Anatole France]] directly addressing the matter of French [[antisemitism]] to the public; thenceforward, "intellectual" became common, yet occasionally derogatory, usage; its French noun usage is attributed to [[Georges Clemenceau]] in 1898.

====Germany====
Habermas' ''Structural Transformation of Public Sphere'' (1963) made significant contribution to the notion of public intellectual by historically and conceptually delineating the idea of private and public.

===In the East===
{{expand section|date=October 2017|small=no}}
In [[Imperial China]], in the period from 206&amp;nbsp;BC until AD&amp;nbsp;1912, the intellectuals were the ''[[Scholar-official]]s'' ("Scholar-gentlemen"), who were civil servants appointed by the [[Emperor of China]] to perform the tasks of daily governance. Such civil servants earned academic degrees by means of [[imperial examination]], and also were skilled [[calligraphy|calligraphers]], and knew [[Confucianism|Confucian]] philosophy. Historian Wing-Tsit Chan concludes that:

{{quote|Generally speaking, the record of these scholar-gentlemen has been a worthy one. It was good enough to be praised and imitated in 18th century Europe. Nevertheless, it has given China a tremendous handicap in their transition from government by men to government by law, and personal considerations in Chinese government have been a curse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Alexander Moore, ed.|title=The Chinese Mind: Essentials of Chinese Philosophy and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_DoyN2h56ucC&amp;pg=PA22|year=1967|publisher=U of Hawaii Press|page=22|isbn=9780824800758}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Joseon|Joseon Korea]] (1392–1910), the intellectuals were the ''literati'', who knew how to read and write, and had been designated, as the [[chungin]] (the "middle people"), in accordance with the Confucian system. Socially, they constituted the  [[petite bourgeoisie]], composed of scholar-bureaucrats (scholars, professionals, and technicians) who administered the dynastic rule of the Joseon dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=The Korea Foundation|title=Koreana - Winter 2015|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WkmOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT73|date=February 12, 2016|pages=73–74|isbn=9791156041573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intelligentsia==
{{See also|Manufacturing Consent}}
Addressing their role as a social class, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] said that intellectuals are the moral conscience of their age; that their moral and ethical responsibilities are to observe the socio-political moment, and to freely speak to their society, in accordance with their consciences.&lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1993:119&lt;/ref&gt; Like Sartre and [[Noam Chomsky]], public intellectuals usually are [[polymath]]s, knowledgeable of the [[International relations|international order]] of the world, the political and economic organization of contemporary society, the institutions and laws that regulate the lives of the layman citizen, the educational systems, and the private networks of [[Mass communication|mass communication media]] that [[Manufacturing Consent|control]] the broadcasting of information to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1999:xii&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas, intellectuals (political scientists and sociologists), liberals, and democratic socialists usually hold, advocate, and support the principles of democracy (liberty, equality, fraternity, human rights, social justice, social welfare, environmental conservation), and the improvement of socio-political relations in domestic and international politics, the [[Conservatism|conservative]] public-intellectuals usually defend the social, economic, and political ''[[status quo]]'' as the realisation of the "perfect ideals" of [[Platonism]], and present a static [[dominant ideology]], in which utopias are unattainable and politically destabilizing of society.

===Marxist perspective===
In [[Marxist philosophy]], the [[social class]] function of the intellectuals (the [[intelligentsia]]) is to be the source of progressive ideas for the transformation of society; to provide advice and counsel to the political leaders; to interpret the country's politics to the mass of the population (urban workers and peasants); and, as required, to provide leaders from within their own ranks.

The Italian Communist theoretician [[Antonio Gramsci]] (1891–1937) developed Karl Marx's conception of the intelligentsia to include political leadership in the public sphere. That, because "all knowledge is [[Existentialism|existentially]]-based", the intellectuals, who create and preserve knowledge, are "spokesmen for different social groups, and articulate particular social interests". That intellectuals occur in each social class and throughout the right wing, the centre, and the left wing of the political spectrum. That, as a social class, the "intellectuals view themselves as autonomous from the [[ruling class]]" of their society. That, in the course of [[Class conflict|class struggle]] meant to achieve political power, every social class requires a native intelligentsia who shape the [[ideology]] (world view) particular to the social class from which they originated. Therefore, the leadership of intellectuals is required for effecting and realizing social change, because:

{{Quotation|A human mass does not "distinguish" itself, does not become independent, in its own right, without, in the widest sense, organising itself; and there is no organisation without intellectuals, that is, without organisers and leaders, in other words, without ... a group of people "specialised" in [the] conceptual and philosophical elaboration of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings and Kemp-Welch, 1997:210.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the pamphlet ''[[What Is to Be Done?]]'' (1902), [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] (1870–1924) said that [[Leninism|vanguard-party revolution]] required the participation of the intellectuals to explain the complexities of [[socialism|socialist]] ideology to the uneducated [[proletariat]] and the urban industrial workers, in  order to integrate them to the revolution; because "the history of all countries shows that the working class, exclusively by its own efforts, is able to develop only [[Trade union|trade-union]] consciousness", and will settle for the limited, socio-economic gains so achieved. In Russia, as in [[Continental Europe]], Socialist theory was the product of the "educated representatives of the propertied classes", of "revolutionary socialist intellectuals", such as were Karl Marx and [[Friedrich Engels]].&lt;ref&gt;Le Blanc, Paul. ''Revolution, Democracy, Socialism: Selected Writings of Lenin'' (Pluto Press, London: 2008) pp. 31, 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the formal codification of [[Leninism]], the Hungarian Marxist philosopher, [[György Lukács]] (1885–1971) identified the intelligentsia as the privileged social class who provide revolutionary leadership. By means of intelligible and accessible interpretation, the intellectuals explain to the workers and peasants the "Who?", the "How?", and the "Why?" of the social, economic, and political ''[[status quo]]''—the ideological totality of society—and its practical, revolutionary application to the transformation of their society.

The term '''public intellectual'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; describes the intellectual participating in the public-affairs [[discourse]] of society, in addition to an academic career.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, Amitai. Ed., ''Public Intellectuals'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the [[Academy|academic]] field or the [[profession]]al expertise, the public intellectual addresses and responds to the [[normative]] problems of society, and, as such, is expected to be an impartial critic who can "rise above the partial preoccupation of one's own profession—and engage with the global issues of [[truth]], judgment, and [[Taste (sociology)|taste]] of the time."&lt;ref&gt;Bauman, 1987: 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Furedi, 2004: 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Representations of the Intellectual]]'' (1994), In summarizing a quote by [[Edward Said|Edward Saïd]], Jennings and Kemp-Welch state that the "… true intellectual is, therefore, always an outsider, living in self-imposed exile, and on the margins of society".&lt;ref&gt;Jennings and Kemp Welch, 1997: 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

An intellectual usually is associated with an [[ideology]] or with a [[philosophy]]; e.g., the [[Third Way]] centrism of [[Anthony Giddens]] in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Government]] of [[Tony Blair]].&lt;ref&gt;McLennan, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The Czech intellectual [[Václav Havel]] said that politics and intellectuals can be linked, but that moral responsibility for the intellectual's ideas, even when advocated by a politician, remains with the intellectual. Therefore, it is best to avoid [[utopia]]n intellectuals who offer 'universal insights' to resolve the problems of [[political economy]] with [[Public policy|public policies]] that might harm and that have harmed civil society; that intellectuals be mindful of the social and cultural ties created with their words, insights, and ideas; and should be heard as social critics of [[politics]] and [[Power (social and political)|power]].&lt;ref name="Jennings and Kemp-Welch, 1997"&gt;Jennings and Kemp-Welch, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennings and Kemp-Welch, 1997: 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social background===
The American academic [[Peter H. Smith]] describes the intellectuals of Latin America as people from an identifiable social class, who have been conditioned by that common experience, and thus are inclined to share a set of [[Value (ethics)|common assumptions]] (values and ethics); that ninety-four per cent of intellectuals come either from the [[middle class]] or from the [[upper class]], and that only six per cent come from the [[working class]]. In ''The Intellectual'' (2005), philosopher [[Steve Fuller (sociologist)|Steven Fuller]] said that, because [[cultural capital]] confers [[power (social and political)|power]] and social status, as a status group, they must be autonomous in order to be credible as intellectuals:

{{Quotation|It is relatively easy to demonstrate autonomy, if you come from a wealthy or [an] [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] background. You simply need to disown your [[social status|status]] and champion the poor and [the] downtrodden ... autonomy is much harder to demonstrate if you come from a poor or [[Proletariat|proletarian]] background ... [thus] calls to join the wealthy in common cause appear to betray one's class origins.|source=&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, 2005: pp. 113–114.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The political importance and effective consequence of [[Émile Zola]] in the [[Dreyfus affair]] (1894–1906) derived from his being a leading French thinker; thus, ''[[J'accuse…!|J'accuse]]'' (I Accuse), his open letter to the French government and the nation proved critical to achieving the exoneration of Captain Alfred Dreyfus of the false charges of treason, which were facilitated by institutional [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]], among other ideological defects of the French Establishment.

===Academic background===
In journalism, the term ''intellectual'' usually connotes "a university academic" of the [[humanities]]—especially a [[philosophy|philosopher]]—who addresses important social and political matters of the day. Hence, such an academic functions as a public intellectual who explains the theoretic bases of said problems and communicates possible answers to the policy makers and executive leaders of society. The sociologist [[Frank Furedi]] said that "Intellectuals are not defined according to the jobs they do, but [by] the manner in which they act, the way they see themselves, and the [social and political] values that they uphold.&lt;ref&gt;Furedi (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Public intellectuals usually arise from the educated élite of a society; although the North American usage of the term "intellectual" includes the university academics.&lt;ref&gt;McKee (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between "intellectual" and "academic" is participation in the realm of public affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public policy role===
In the matters of [[Public policy doctrine|public policy]], the public intellectual connects scholarly research to the practical matters of solving societal problems. The British sociologist [[Michael Burawoy]], an exponent of [[public sociology]], said that professional sociology has failed, by giving insufficient attention to resolving social problems, and that a dialogue between the academic and the layman would bridge the gap.&lt;ref&gt;Gattone 2007&lt;/ref&gt; An example is how [[Chile]]an intellectuals worked to reestablish [[democracy]] within the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]], [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] governments of the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)]], the Pinochet régime allowed professional opportunities for some liberal and left-wing social scientists to work as politicians and as consultants in effort to realize the theoretical economics of the [[Chicago Boys]], but their access to [[Power (social and political)|power]] was contingent upon political [[pragmatism]], abandoning the political neutrality of the academic intellectual.&lt;ref&gt;Sorkin (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Sociological Imagination]]'' (1959), [[C. Wright Mills]] said that academics had become ill-equipped for participating in public discourse, and that journalists usually are "more politically alert and knowledgeable than sociologists, economists, and especially ... political scientists".&lt;ref name=Mills&gt;Mills, 1959: 99.&lt;/ref&gt; That, because the universities of the U.S. are bureaucratic, private businesses, they "do not teach [[Critical thinking|critical reasoning]] to the student", who then does not "how to gauge what is going on in the general struggle for power in modern society".&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt; Likewise, [[Richard Rorty]] criticized the participation of intellectuals in public discourse as an example of the "civic irresponsibility of [[Intellectualism|intellect]], especially academic intellect".&lt;ref&gt;Bender, T, 1993: 142.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage= | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?169625-1/public-intellectuals ''Booknotes'' interview with Posner on ''Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline'', June 2, 2002], [[C-SPAN]]}}
The American legal scholar [[Richard Posner]] said that the participation of academic public intellectuals in the public life of society is characterized by logically untidy and politically biased statements of the kind that would be unacceptable to academia. That there are few ideologically and politically independent public intellectuals, and disapproves that public intellectuals limit themselves to practical matters of public policy, and not with [[Value (ethics)|values]] or [[public philosophy]], or public [[ethics]], or [[public theology]], not with matters of moral and spiritual outrage.

In "An Interview with Milton Friedman" (1974), the American [[libertarian]] economist [[Milton Friedman]] said that businessmen and the intellectuals are enemies of capitalism; the intellectuals, because most believed in socialism, while the businessman expected economic privileges:

{{Quotation|The two, chief enemies of the free society or [[free enterprise]] are intellectuals, on the one hand, and businessmen, on the other, for opposite reasons. Every intellectual believes in freedom for himself, but he's opposed to freedom for others. ... He thinks ... [that] there ought to be a central planning board that will establish social priorities. ... The businessmen are just the opposite—every businessman is in favor of freedom for everybody else, but, when it comes to himself that's a different question. He's always "the special case". He ought to get special privileges from the government, a [[tariff]], this, that, and the other thing. ...&lt;ref&gt;''[[Reason Magazine]]'', "[http://reason.com/archives/1974/12/01/an-interview-with-milton-fried An Interview with Milton Friedman]". December 1974&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In "The Intellectuals and Socialism" (1949), the British libertarian economist [[Friedrich Hayek]], said that "journalists, teachers, ministers, lecturers, publicists, radio commentators, writers of fiction, cartoonists, and artists", are the intellectual social class whose function is to communicate the complex and specialized knowledge of the [[scientist]] to the general public. That, in the twentieth century, the intellectuals were attracted to socialism and to [[social democracy]], because the socialists offered "broad visions; the spacious comprehension of the social order, as a whole, which a [[Planned economy|planned system]] promises" and that such broad-vision philosophies "succeeded in inspiring the imagination of the intellectuals" to change and improve their societies.&lt;ref&gt;"The Intellectuals and Socialism", ''The University of Chicago Law Review'' (Spring 1949),&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hayek, intellectuals disproportionately support socialism for [[idealistic]] and [[utopia]]n reasons that cannot be realized in practical terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/etexts/hayekintellectuals.pdf|title=Papers of Interest|work=Mises Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in the article "Why Socialism?" (1949), [[Albert Einstein]] said that [[Political economy|the economy]] of the world is not private property because it is a "planetary community of production and consumption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.monthlyreview.org/598einstein.php |title=Why Socialism? [1949] |author=Albert Einstein |work=Monthly Review |volume=61 |issue=1 |date=May 2009 |origyear=May 1949|accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In U.S. society, the intellectual status class are [[demographic]]ally characterized as people who hold [[Liberalism|liberal]]-to-[[leftist]] political perspectives about [[Guns versus butter model|guns-or-butter]] [[fiscal policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people-press.org/report/?pageid=1549 |title=Public Praises Science; Scientists Fault Public, Media: Section 4: Scientists, Politics and Religion - Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press |publisher=People-press.org |date=9 July 2009|accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Heartless Lovers of Humankind" (1987), the journalist and [[popular historian]] [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] said:
{{Quotation|It is not the formulation of ideas, however misguided, but the desire to impose them on others that is the deadly sin of the intellectuals. That is why they so incline, by temperament, to [[Left-wing politics|the Left]]. For capitalism merely occurs; if no-one does anything to stop it. It is [[socialism]] that has to be constructed, and, as a rule, forcibly imposed, thus providing a far bigger role for intellectuals in its genesis. The [[Progressivism|progressive]] intellectual habitually entertains [[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty|Walter Mitty]] visions of exercising power.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul. "The Heartless Lovers of Humankind", ''The Wall Street Journal'', 5 January 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The public- and private-knowledge dichotomy originated in [[Ancient Greece]], from [[Socrates]]'s rejection of the [[Sophist]] concept that the pursuit of knowledge ([[truth]]) is a "public market of ideas", open to all men of the city, not only to philosophers. In contradiction to the Sophist's public market of knowledge, Socrates proposed a knowledge monopoly for and by the philosophers; thus, "those who sought a more penetrating and rigorous intellectual life rejected, and withdrew from, the general culture of the city, in order to embrace a new model of professionalism"; the private market of ideas.&lt;ref name=Bender12/&gt;

In the 19th century, addressing the societal place, roles, and functions of intellectuals in American society, the [[Congregational church|Congregational]] theologian [[Edwards Amasa Park]] said, "We do wrong to our own minds, when we carry out scientific difficulties down to the arena of popular dissension".&lt;ref name=Bender12&gt;Bender, T, 1993: 12.&lt;/ref&gt; That for the stability of society (social, economic, political) it is necessary "to separate the serious, [[Social engineering (political science)|technical role]] of professionals from their responsibility [for] supplying [[Public policy|usable philosophies]] for the general public"; thus operated Socrate's cultural dichotomy of public-knowledge and private-knowledge, of "civic culture" and "professional culture", the social constructs that describe and establish the [[Intellectualism|intellectual sphere of life]] as separate and apart from the civic sphere of life.&lt;ref name=Bender12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bender, T, 1993: 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intelligentsia===
The American historian [[Norman Stone]] said that the intellectual [[social class]] misunderstand the reality of society and so are doomed to the errors of [[logical fallacy]], ideological stupidity, and poor planning hampered by ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings and Kemp Welch, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; In her memoirs, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician [[Margaret Thatcher]] said that the anti-monarchical [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799) was "a [[utopia]]n attempt to overthrow a traditional order ... in the name of [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|abstract ideas]], formulated by vain intellectuals".&lt;ref&gt;Thatcher, 1993:753.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, as Prime Minister, Thatcher asked Britain's academics to help her government resolve the social problems of British society—whilst she retained the [[populist]] opinion of "The Intellectual" as being a man of un-British character, a [[Intellectualism|thinker]], not a doer; Thatcher's anti-intellectualist perspective was shared by the mass media, especially  ''[[The Spectator]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' newspapers, whose reportage documented a "lack of intellectuals" in Britain.&lt;ref name="Jennings and Kemp-Welch, 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collini, 2006: 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his essay "Why do intellectuals oppose capitalism?" (1998), [[libertarian]] philosopher [[Robert Nozick]] of the [[Cato Institute]] argued that intellectuals become embittered [[leftist]]s because their academic skills, much rewarded at school and at university, are under-valued and under-paid in the capitalist [[market economy]]; so, the intellectuals turned against capitalism—despite enjoying a more economically and financially comfortable life in a capitalist society than they might enjoy in either a [[socialist]] or a [[communist society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/cpr-20n1-1.html |title=Why do intellectuals oppose capitalism? |first=Robert |last=Nozick |journal=Cato Policy Report |volume=20 |issue=1 |date=January–February 1998 |pages=1, 9–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[post-Communist]] Europe, the social attitude perception of the intelligentsia became [[anti-intellectual]]; in the [[Netherlands]], the word "intellectual" negatively connotes an overeducated person of "unrealistic visions of the World". In [[Hungary]], the intellectual is perceived as an "egghead", a person who is "too-clever" for the good of society. In the [[Czech Republic]], the intellectual is a cerebral person, aloof from reality. Such derogatory connotations of "intellectual" are not definitive, because, in the "case of English usage, positive, neutral, and pejorative uses can easily coexist"; the example is [[Václav Havel]] who, "to many outside observers, [became] a favoured instance of The Intellectual as National Icon" in the early history of the post-Communist Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Collini, 2006: 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book, ''[[Intellectuals and Society]]'' (2010), the economist [[Thomas Sowell]] said that, lacking [[disincentive]]s in professional life, the intellectual (producer of knowledge, not material goods) tends to speak outside his or her area of expertise, and expects social and professional benefits from the [[halo effect]], derived from possessing professional expertise. That, in relation to other professions, the public intellectual is socially detached from the negative and [[unintended consequences]] of [[public policy]] derived from his or her ideas. As such, the philosopher and mathematician [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872–1970) advised the British government against national rearmament in the years before [[World War I]] (1914–1918), while the [[German Empire]] prepared for war. Yet, the post-war intellectual reputation of Bertrand Russell remained almost immaculate and his opinions respected by the general public because of the halo effect.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Thomas (2010).

The '''internal–external distinction''' is a distinction used in philosophy to divide an [[ontology]] into two parts: an internal part consisting of a linguistic framework and observations related to that framework, and an external part concerning practical questions about the utility of that framework. This division was introduced by [[Rudolf Carnap]] in his work ''Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology''.&lt;ref name=Carnap/&gt; It was subsequently criticized at length by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] in a number of works,&lt;ref name=Quine2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Quine3/&gt; and was considered for some time to have been discredited. However, recently a number of authors have come to the support of some or another version of Carnap's approach.&lt;ref name=Yablo/&gt;&lt;ref name=AllspectorKelly/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt;

==Linguistic framework==
Carnap introduced the idea of a 'linguistic framework' or a 'form of language' that uses a precise specification of the definitions of and the relations between entities. The discussion of a proposition within a framework can take on a logical or an empirical (that is, factual) aspect. The logical aspect concerns whether the proposition respects the definitions and rules set up in the framework. The empirical aspect concerns the application of the framework in some or another practical situation.
{{quote| “If someone wishes to speak in his language about a new kind of entities, he has to introduce a system of new ways of speaking, subject to new rules; we shall call this procedure the construction of a linguistic framework for the new entities in question.”|Rudolf Carnap|Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology}}
{{quote|“After the new forms are introduced into the language, it is possible to formulate with their help internal questions and possible answers to them. A question of this kind may be either empirical or logical; accordingly a true answer is either factually true or analytic.”|Rudolf Carnap|Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology}}

The utility of a linguistic framework constitutes issues that Carnap calls 'external' or 'pragmatic'.
{{quote|“To be sure, we have to face at this point an important question; but it is a practical, not a theoretical question; it is the question of whether or not to accept the new linguistic forms. The acceptance cannot be judged as being either true or false because it is not an assertion. It can only be judged as being more or less expedient, fruitful, conducive to the aim for which the language is intended. Judgments of this kind supply the motivation for the decision of accepting or rejecting the kind of entities.”|Rudolf Carnap|Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology}}
{{quote|“the decisive question is not the alleged ontological question of the existence of abstract entities but rather the question whether the rise of abstract linguistic forms or, in technical terms, the use of variables beyond those for things (or phenomenal data), is expedient and fruitful for the purposes for which semantical analyses are made, viz. the analysis, interpretation, clarification, or construction of languages of communication, especially languages of science.”|Rudolf Carnap|Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology}}

The distinction between 'internal' and 'external' arguments is not as obvious as it might appear. For example, discussion of the [[imaginary unit]] {{radic|−1}} ''might'' be an internal question framed in the language of [[complex number]]s about the correct usage of {{radic|−1}}, or it {{em|might}} be a question about the utility of complex numbers: whether there is any practical advantage in using {{radic|−1}}.&lt;ref name=Yablo/&gt; Clearly the question of utility is not completely separable from the way a linguistic framework is organized. A more formal statement of the internal-external difference is provided by Myhill:
{{quote|"A question...is internal relative to [a linguistic framework] ''T'' if the asker accepts ''T'' at the time of his asking, and is prepared to use ''T'' in order to obtain an answer; external otherwise, in particular if the question is part of a chain of reflections and discussions aimed at choosing between ''T'' and some rival theory."&lt;ref name=Myhill/&gt;|John R Myhill| Review of W. V. Quine: "On Carnap's Views on Ontology"}}

==Quine's critique==
Quine disputed Carnap's position from several points of view. His most famous criticism of Carnap was ''Two dogmas of empiricism'', but this work is not directed at the internal-external distinction but at the [[analytic-synthetic distinction]] brought up by Carnap in his work on logic: ''Meaning and Necessity''.&lt;ref name=Quine/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carnap2/&gt; Quine's criticism of the internal-external distinction is found in his works ''On Carnap's views on Ontology'' and ''Word and Object''.&lt;ref name=Quine2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Quine3/&gt;

Quine's approach to the internal-external division was to cast internal questions as ''subclass'' questions and external questions as ''category'' questions. What Quine meant by 'subclass' questions were questions like "what are so-and-so's?" where the answers are restricted to lie within a specific linguistic framework. On the other hand, 'category' questions were questions like "what are so-and-so's?"  asked outside any specific language where the answers are not so-restricted.&lt;ref name=Thomasson/&gt; The term ''subclass'' arises as follows: Quine supposes that a particular linguistic framework selects from a broad ''category'' of meanings for a term, say ''furniture'', a particular or subclass of meanings, say ''chairs''.

Quine argued that there is always possible an overarching language that encompasses both types of question and the distinction between the two types is artificial.
{{quote|It is evident that the question whether there are numbers will be a category question only with respect to languages which appropriate a separate style of variables for the exclusive purpose of referring to numbers. If our language refers to numbers through variables that also take classes other than numbers as values, then the question whether there are numbers becomes a subclass question...Even the question whether there are classes, or whether there are physical objects becomes a subclass question if our language uses a single style of variables to range over both sorts of entities. Whether the statement that there are physical objects and the statement that there are black swans should be put on the same side of the dichotomy, or on opposite sides, comes to depend upon the rather trivial consideration of whether we use one style of variables or two for physical objects and classes.|Willard van Orman Quine| Carnap's views on ontology}}

So we can switch back and forth from internal to external questions just by a shift of vocabulary. As Thomasson puts it,&lt;ref name=Thomasson/&gt; if our language refers to 'things' we can ask of all the ''things'' there are, are any of them ''numbers''; while if our language includes only 'numbers', we can ask only narrower questions like whether any ''numbers'' are ''prime numbers''. In other words, Quine's position is that "Carnap's main objection to metaphysics rests on an unsupported premise, namely the assumption that there is some sort of principled plurality in language which blocks Quine's move to homogenize the [[existential quantifier]]."&lt;ref name=Price/&gt; "What is to stop us treating all ontological issues as internal questions within a single grand framework?"&lt;ref name=Price/&gt;

==Later views==
A view close to Quine’s subclass/category description is called ‘’conceptual relativity’’.&lt;ref name=Putnam/&gt; To describe conceptual relativity, Putnam points out that while the pages of a book are regarded as part of book when they are attached, they are things-in-themselves if they are detached. My nose is only part of an object, my person. On the other hand, is my nose the same as the collection of atoms or molecules forming it? This arbitrariness of language is called conceptual relativity, a matter of conventions.&lt;ref name=Putnam2/&gt; The point is made that if one wishes to refer only to 'pages', then books may not exist, and ''vice versa'' if one wishes to admit only to books. Thus, in this view, the Carnapian multiplicity of possible linguistic frameworks proposes a variety of 'realities' and the prospect of choosing between them, a form of what is called [[ontological pluralism]], or multiple realities.&lt;ref name=Thomasson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eklund/&gt;  The notion of 'one reality' behind our everyday perceptions is common in everyday life, and some find it unsettling that what 'exists' might be a matter of what language one chooses to use.  This belief, however, is rendered somewhat plastic by the fact that we cannot see this underlying 'reality' directly, raising a philosophical issue called the [[subject–object problem]].

A related idea is [[quantifier variance]].&lt;ref name=Hirsch/&gt; Loosely speaking a [[existential quantifier|'quantifier expression']] is just a function that says ''there exists at least one such-and-such''. Then 'quantifier variance' combines the notion that the same object can have different names, so the quantifier may refer to the same thing even though different names are employed by it, and the notion that quantifier expressions can be formed in a variety of ways. Hirsch says this arbitrariness over what 'exists' is a quandary only due to Putnam's formulation, and it is resolved by turning things upside down and saying things that exist can have different names. In other words, Hirsch agrees with Quine that there is an overarching language that we can adapt to different situations. The Carnapian internal/external distinction in this view, as with the subclass/category distinction, is just a matter of language, and has nothing to do with 'reality'.&lt;ref name=Hirsch1/&gt;

More recently, some philosophers have stressed that the real issue is not one of language as such, but the difference between questions asked ''using'' a linguistic framework and those asked somehow before the adoption of a linguistic framework, the difference between questions about the construction and rules of a framework, and questions about the decision whether to use a framework.&lt;ref name=Thomasson/&gt; This distinction is called by Thomasson and Price the difference between ‘’using’’ a term and ‘’mentioning’’ a term.&lt;ref name=Thomasson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Price/&gt; As Price notes, Carnap holds that there is a mistake involved in "assimilating issues of the existence of numbers (say) and of the existence of physical objects...the distinctions in question are not grounded at the syntactical level."&lt;ref name=Price/&gt; Price suggests a connection with Ryle's view of different functions of language:
{{quote|Ryle's functional orientation attention – his attention to the question as to what a linguistic category ''does'' –  will instead lead us to focus on the difference between the ''functions'' of talk of beliefs and talk of tables; on the issue of what the two kinds of talk are ''for'', rather than that of what they are ''about''.&lt;ref name=Ryle/&gt;|Huw Price |Metaphysics after Carnap: The ghost who walks, p. 331}}

Although not supporting an entire lack of distinction like the subclass/category view of Quine, as a ''pragmatic'' issue, the use/mention distinction still does not provide a sharp division between the issues of forming and conceptualizing a framework and deciding whether to adopt it: each informs the other.&lt;ref name=convention/&gt; An example is the well-known tension between mathematicians and physicists, the one group very concerned over questions of logic and rigor, and the other inclined to sacrifice a bit of rigor to explain observations.&lt;ref name=Lutzen/&gt;
{{quote|But the poor mathematician translates it into equations, and as the symbols do not mean anything to him he has no guide but precise mathematical rigor and care in the argument. The physicist, who knows more or less how the answer is going to come out, can sort of guess part way, and so go along rather rapidly. The mathematical rigor of great precision is not very useful in physics. But one should not criticize the mathematicians on this score...They are doing their own job.&lt;ref name=Feynman/&gt; |Richard Feynman |The character of physical law, pp. 56-57}}
One approach to selecting a framework is based upon an examination of the conceptual relations between entities in a framework, which entities are more 'fundamental'. One framework may then 'include' another because the entities in one framework apparently can be derived from or [[Supervenience|'supervene']] upon those in the more fundamental one.&lt;ref name=supervene/&gt;  While Carnap claims such decisions are pragmatic in nature, external questions with no philosophical importance, Schaffer suggests we avoid this formulation. Instead, we should go back to Aristotle and look upon nature as hierarchical, and pursue philosophical ''diagnostics'': that is, examination of criteria for what is fundamental and what relations exist between all entities and these fundamental ones.&lt;ref name=Schaffer/&gt; But "how can we discover what grounds what?...questions regarding not only what grounds what, but also what the grounding consists in, and how one may discover or discern grounding facts, seem to be part of an emerging set of relational research problems in metaphysics."&lt;ref name=Thomasson2/&gt;

Some caution is warranted here. For example, [[Newton's laws of motion]] suffice for practical engineering work like building and bridge design, even though the more 'fundamental' theory of the [[Standard model]] of [[elementary particle physics]] is available. The more 'fundamental' model is, for such engineering, superfluous.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2695">[[File:Nicolai Wergeland.jpg|thumb|[[Nicolai Wergeland]], one of the principal authors of the clause.]]

The '''Jew clause''' ({{lang-no|Jødeparagrafen}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=no&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stortinget.no%2Fno%2FStortinget-og-demokratiet%2FHistorikk%2FHistorisk-dokumentasjon%2FJodeparagrafen%2F&amp;edit-text=|title=A digital dissemination of documents to the history of the Jews Act, § 2, last passus, in the Norwegian Constitution of 17 May 1814.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is in the vernacular name of the second paragraph of the [[Constitution of Norway]] from 1814 to 1851. The clause, in its original form, banned [[Jews]] from entering [[Norway]], and also forbade [[Jesuits]] and monastic orders. An exception was made for so-called [[Portuguese Jews]]. The penultimate sentence of the same paragraph is known as the Jesuit clause ({{lang-no|Jesuittparagrafen}}).

The clause roughly translates as:

{{quote|The Evangelical-Lutheran religion is the state's public religion. The inhabitants who practice it are obliged to raise their children in the same. Jesuits and monastic orders may not be tolerated. Jews are excluded from access to the Kingdom.}}

[[Christian Magnus Falsen]], [[Georg Sverdrup]] and [[Nicolai Wergeland]] were the central delegates behind the wording of the section's final paragraph. The wording was adopted on May 4, 1814. This paragraph was finalized in Constitutional Committee and adopted after discussion, but without changes in the plenary.

On June 13, 1851,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=no&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stortinget.no%2Fno%2FStortinget-og-demokratiet%2FHistorikk%2FHistorisk-dokumentasjon%2FJodeparagrafen%2F&amp;edit-text=|title=The abolition of the Jews Act in Norway's Basic Law 1814 - 1851 - 2001. Brief history and description of the documentation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; after tireless efforts by the poet [[Henrik Wergeland]] (the son of the clause's architect Nicolai Wergeland), as well as politician [[Peder Jensen Fauchald]], school principal [[Hans Holmboe]], and others, the [[Parliament of Norway|Norwegian parliament]] deleted the article from the constitution, and thereby lifted the ban against Jews, who were thus awarded religious rights on par with Christian dissenters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32177">'''Leaderless resistance''', or '''phantom cell''' structure, is a [[Rebellion|social resistance]] [[strategy]] in which small, independent groups ([[Clandestine cell system|covert cells]]), or individuals (a solo cell is called a "[[Lone wolf (terrorism)|Lone Wolf]]"), challenge an established institution such as a law, economic system, social order, or government. Leaderless resistance can encompass anything from [[nonviolence|non-violent]] protest and [[civil disobedience]] to [[vandalism]], [[terrorism]], and other violent activity.

Leaderless cells lack vertical command links and so operate without hierarchical command,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Simson Garfinkel]] | title = Leaderless resistance today | url = http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1040| work=First Monday| volume= 8| issue= 3|date=3 March 2003| accessdate = May 7, 2006 |doi=10.5210/fm.v8i3.1040}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they have a common goal that links them to the social movement from which their ideology was learned.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;Joosse, Paul. 2007. "Leaderless Resistance and Ideological Inclusion: the Case of the Earth Liberation Front. Terrorism and Political Violence 19(3): 351-368. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09546550701424042?journalCode=ftpv20&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaderless resistance is simple and difficult to stamp out. It has been employed by a wide range of movements, including [[animal-liberation movement|animal-liberation]], [[radical environmentalist movements|radical environmentalist]], [[Pro-life movement|anti-abortion]], military [[invasion]] resistance, [[colonialism]] resistance, [[terrorism|terrorist]], and [[hate group]]s.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt;

==General characteristics==
A covert cell may be a lone individual or a small group. The basic characteristic of the structure is that there is no explicit communication between cells that are acting toward shared goals. Members of one cell usually have little or no information about who else is agitating on behalf of their cause.

Leaderless movements may have a symbolic figurehead. This can be a public figure, a [[multiple-use name]], or an inspirational author, who picks generic targets and objectives, but does not actually manage or execute plans. [[Mass media|Media]], in this case, often create a [[positive feedback loop]]: by publishing declarations of a movement’s role model, this instills motivation, ideas, and assumed sympathy in the minds of potential agitators who in turn lend further authority to the figurehead.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} While this may loosely resemble a vertical command structure, it is notably unidirectional: a titular leader makes pronouncements, and activists may respond, but there is no formal contact between the two levels of organization.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt;

As a result, leaderless resistance cells are resistant to [[informant]]s and [[traitor]]s. As there is neither a center that may be destroyed, nor links between the cells that may be infiltrated, it is more difficult for established authorities to arrest the development of a leaderless resistance movement than it is with movements that adopt more conventional hierarchies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Given {{clarify|date=July 2018|reason=what's asymmetrical about it? asymmetrical with respect to what?|text=the asymmetrical character}} of leaderless resistance, and the fact that it is often strategically adopted in the face of a power imbalance, it has much in common with [[guerrilla warfare]]. The latter strategy, however, usually retains some form of organized, bidirectional leadership and is often more {{clarify|date=July 2018|reason=what does this mean?|text=broad-based}} than the individualized actions of leaderless cells. In some cases, a largely leaderless movement may evolve into a coherent [[insurgency]] or guerrilla movement, as with the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Yugoslav partisans]] of [[World War II]].&lt;!-- In the same conflict, the [[United Kingdom|British]] leadership had extensive plans for the use of such resistance in the event of a successful [[Operation Sealion|German invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=British Resistance Organisation |title=History |url=http://www.parhamairfieldmuseum.co.uk/brohistory.html |publisher=parhamairfieldmuseum.co.uk |accessdate=May 7, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315030541/http://www.parhamairfieldmuseum.co.uk/brohistory.html |archivedate=March 15, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {trivia that doesn't relate to the main topic}--&gt;

Leaderless resistance often involves resistance by violent means, but it is not limited to them. Non-violent groups can use the same structure to author, print, and distribute [[samizdat]] literature, to create self-propagating [[boycotts]] against political opponents via the internet, to maintain an alternative [[Digital currency|electronic currency]] outside of the reach of taxing governments and transaction-logging banks, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;Joosse, Paul. 2012.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
The concept of leaderless resistance was developed by Col. [[Ulius Louis Amoss]], a former [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. intelligence]] officer, in the early 1960s. An [[anti-communist]], Amoss saw leaderless resistance as a way to prevent the penetration and destruction of CIA-supported resistance cells in Eastern European countries under Soviet control.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150626193618/http://www.defendingdissent.org/fame/index.php?title=Leaderless_Resistance:_Amoss_Version_1953-1962] Amoss as cited in Defending Dissent Foundation Study Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was revived and popularized in an essay published by the anti-government [[Ku Klux Klan]] member [[Louis Beam]] in 1983 and again in 1992. Beam advocated leaderless resistance as a technique for [[white nationalism|white nationalists]] to continue the struggle against the [[Federal Government of the United States|U.S. government]], despite an overwhelming imbalance in power and resources.

Beam argued that conventional [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] pyramidal organizations are extremely dangerous for their participants, when employed in a resistance movement against government, because of the ease of disclosing the [[chain of command]]. A less dangerous approach would be to convince like-minded individuals to form independent cells without close communication between each other but generally operating in the same direction.

The first recorded [[direct action]] for [[animal liberation movement|animal liberation]] which progressed (after a considerable delay) into a movement of leaderless resistance was by the original "Band of Mercy" in 1824 whose goal was to thwart [[fox hunters]].&lt;ref name=Best&gt;Best &amp; Nocella (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters'', Lantern Books, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by this group and after seeing a pregnant deer driven into the village by fox hunters to be killed, John Prestige decided to actively oppose this sport and formed the [[Hunt Saboteurs Association]] (HSA) in 1964. Within a year, a leaderless model of hunt-sabotage groups was formed across the country.&lt;ref name=Best/&gt;

A new [[Band of Mercy]] was then formed in 1972. It used direct action to liberate animals and cause economic sabotage against those thought to be abusing animals. [[Ronnie Lee]] and others changed the name of the movement to the [[Animal Liberation Front]] (ALF) in 1976 and adopted a leaderless resistance model focusing broadly on animal liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Robin. "Animal Liberation — By 'Whatever Means Necessary'," in Best &amp; Nocella (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters, Lantern Books, 2004, p. 77.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Earth First!]] and the [[environmental movement]] in the 1980s also adopted the leaderless resistance model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Southern Poverty Law Center | title = From Push to Shove | url = http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=42 | accessdate = May 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An animal liberation movement advocating violence emerged with the name [[Animal Rights Militia]] (ARM) in 1982.

The [[Earth Liberation Front]] (ELF) formed in 1992, breaking from Earth First! when that organization decided to focus on public direct action, instead of the [[ecotage]] that the ELF participated in,&lt;ref&gt;Alleyne, Richard.

In 1999 the leaderless resistance strategy was employed by animal liberation organisations like [[Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty]] (SHAC), which was formed from the [[Consort beagles]] campaign and [[Save the Hill Grove Cats]] to close down [[Huntingdon Life Sciences]] (HLS). Despite claiming successes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shac.net/MISC/quantum Quantum Analytics: Drop HLS], ''[[Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty|SHAC]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; leaderless animal liberation and environmental movements generally lack the broad popular support that often occurs in strictly political or military conflicts.{{cite needed|date=July 2018}} The [[Revolutionary Cells (RCALB)|Revolutionary Cells--Animal Liberation Brigade]] (RCALB) appeared in 2003 and sent pipe bombs to [[Chiron Corporation]] and used [[incendiary device]]s against other targets{{clarify |date=July 2018 |reason=It's unclear what the significance of this is to the page topic.|text=, whilst a year later on the south coast of [[Dorset]], the [[Lobster Liberation Front]] (LLF) was founded}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/dorset/3939111.stm "Activists' 'war' to save lobsters"], ''BBC News'', July 30, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few years of the victories claimed by the SHAC, other campaigns against animal testing laboratories emerged. At the same time, [[SPEAK (animals)|SPEAK Campaigns]] and the more radical ALF militants, [[Oxford Arson Squad]] began their campaigns towards the same goal: to end [[Oxford University]]'s animal research.

In April 2009, the [[Militant Forces Against Huntingdon Life Sciences]] (MFAH) became active. With the ALF, they began targeting HLS customer and financial Directors, as well as company property.

===Islamists===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
Leaderless resistance is also often well-suited to terrorist objectives. The [[Islamist terrorism|Islamist]] organization [[Al-Qaeda]] uses a typical figurehead/leaderless cell structure. The organization itself may be pyramidal, but sympathizers who act on its pronouncements often do so spontaneously and independently.

Given the small, clandestine character of terrorist cells, it is easy to assume they necessarily constitute leaderless resistance models. When there is bidirectional communication with external leadership, however, the label is inappropriate. The men who executed the bombings of the [[London Underground]] on July 7, 2005 constituted a leaderless resistance cell in that they purportedly acted out of sympathy for [[Islamic fundamentalism]] but under their own auspices. The hijackers involved in the [[September 11 attacks]], by contrast, allegedly received training, direction, and funding from Al-Qaeda, and are not properly designated a leaderless cell.

===Neo-Nazis===
The concept of leaderless resistance remains important to much far right thinking in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Paul de Armond | title = Putting the Far Right into Perspective | url = http://www.publicgood.org/reports/spectrum/ | accessdate = May 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a proposed response to perceived federal government over-reach at the expense of individual rights. {{clarify |date=July 2018 |reason=Garfinkel has yet to be introduced. Who is he?|text=Garfinkel }}, however, found in his research that for the most part the far right seldom used this tactic,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. [[Timothy McVeigh]] is one example in the [[United States]]. McVeigh worked in a small cell which based its attack on motivations widespread among far-right anti-government groups and the militia movement.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Leaderless resistance has been advocated by White Supremacist groups such as [[White Aryan Resistance]] and the British neo-Nazi [[Combat 18]]. The modern [[Ku Klux Klan]] is also credited with having developed a leaderless resistance model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = University of Michigan | title = Right-Wing Domestic Terrorism | url = http://www-personal.umich.edu/~lormand/agenda/9909/06.pdf | accessdate = May 7, 2006 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Troy Southgate]] also advocated forms of leaderless resistance during his time as a leading activist in the [[National Revolutionary Faction]] and a pioneer of [[National-Anarchism]].

Leaderless resistance emerged in the environmental movement in 1976 when [[John Hanna (activist)|John Hanna]] and others as the [[Environmental Life Force]] (ELF) (also known now as the ''original ELF'') used explosive and [[incendiary device]]s.

In 1980 [[Earth First!]] was founded by [[Dave Foreman]] and others to confront environmental destruction, primarily of the American West. Inspired by the [[Edward Abbey]] novel ''[[The Monkey Wrench Gang]]'', Earth First! made use of such techniques as [[treesitting]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penbay.org/ef/treesit_first1985.html Earth First's first treesitting civil disobedience action] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051016222643/http://www.penbay.org/ef/treesit_first1985.html |date=2005-10-16 }}, ''Earth First! 1985'', Oregon, June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[treespiking]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.things.org/~jym/ef/tree-spiking-memo.html Tree Spiking Memo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424015446/http://www.things.org/~jym/ef/tree-spiking-memo.html |date=2008-04-24 }}, ''Earth First!'', April 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; to stop [[logging]] companies, as well as other activities targeted towards [[mining]], [[road]] construction,&lt;ref name="wall"&gt;{{cite book | title = Earth First! and the Anti-Roads Movement: Radical Environmentalism and Comparative Social Movements | last = Wall | first = Derek | year = 1999 | publisher = Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[suburb]]an development, and [[Energy development|energy companies]].

The organization was committed to nonviolent [[ecotage]] techniques from the group's inception. Others split from the movement in the 1990s, including the [[Earth Liberation Front]] (ELF) in 1992, which named itself after the [[Animal Liberation Front]] (ALF) which had formed in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenfield.fortunecity.com/tree/16/fire.html ELF Burns Down Vail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211235040/http://greenfield.fortunecity.com/tree/16/fire.html |date=2006-02-11 }}, ''FIRE'', December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later in [[Canada]], inspired by the ELF in [[Europe]], the first ''Earth Liberation'' [[direct action]] occurred, but this time as the [[Earth Liberation Army]] (ELA), a similar movement who use ecotage and [[monkeywrenching]] as a tool.

A series of actions earned ELF the label of [[eco-terrorism|eco-terrorists]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://prfamerica.org/EarthLiberationFrontNo1onFBIList.html Earth Liberation Front is now FBI's No. 1 Domestic Terrorist Threat], ''Property Rights of America Foundation Inc'', March 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthliberationfront.com/elf_news.htm ELF News], ''Earth Liberation Front''&lt;/ref&gt; including the burning of a [[ski]] resort in [[Vail, Colorado]] in 1998, and the burning of an [[SUV]] dealership in [[Oregon]] in 1999.

Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] several laws were passed{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} increasing the penalty for ecoterrorism, and the U.S. Congress held hearings on the activity of groups such as the ELF.

===Network analysis in classical setting===
Leaderless resistance [[social network]]s are potentially vulnerable to [[social network analysis]] and its derivative, [[link analysis]].

Network analysis was successfully used by French Colonel [[Yves Godard (French officer)|Yves Godard]] to break the [[Nationalism and resistance in Algeria|Algerian resistance]] between 1955 and 1957 and force them to cease their [[bombing]] campaigns. The Algerian conflict may be better described as guerrilla in nature rather than leaderless resistance (see ''Modern Warfare'' by Col. Roger Trinquier), and this illustrates the weakness of cell-structured insurgents when compared to leaderless ones. {{clarify |date=July 2018 |reason=What is mapping data?

Traditional organizations leave behind much evidence of their activities, such as money trails, and training and recruitment material. Leaderless resistances, supported more by [[ideology|ideologies]] than organizations, generally lack such traces.

Individual cells (and even a single person can be a cell) can communicate over the internet, anonymously or semi-anonymously sharing information online, to be found by others through well-known websites. Even when it is legally and technically possible to ascertain who accessed what, it is often practically impossible to discern in a reasonable timeframe who is a real threat and who is just curious, a journalist, or a [[web crawler]].

Despite these advantages, leaderless resistance is often unstable.{{cite needed|date=July 2018}} If the actions are not frequent enough or not successful, the stream of publicity, which serves as the recruiting, motivation, and coordination drives for other cells, diminishes. On the other hand, if the actions are too successful, [[support group]]s and other [[social structure]]s will form that are vulnerable to network analysis.

'''''Libertas ecclesiae''''' ("freedom of the Church" in [[Latin]]) is the notion of freedom of ecclesiastical authority from secular or the temporal power, which guided the [[Gregorian Reform|Reform]] movement which began in the 11th century.

==Description==
After the decentralization of the post-Carolingian period, this became the slogan of the Church in light of disapproval over lay warlords installing themselves as abbots and other high-profile churchmen. Unfit to perform theological functions, much less to defend the interests of the Church, these warlords viewed Church property as an extension of their own landholdings.

What resulted was the plunder of movable wealth (of which the monasteries had become the keepers during the period of Viking invasion) and the parcelling out of land and office as the temporal powers saw fit. This sorry state of the Church prompted enthusiasm for 'freeing' it from the direct control of these milites; Gregory VII helped frame this goal through the specifics of his reform program.

In addition to calling for spiritually pure figures at the helm of the Church, Gregory VII addressed the practical problems of pluralism (holding more than one church office) and poorly educated clerics.

{{original research|date=October 2017}}
{{refimprove|date=October 2017}}
This section of the [[list of rampage killers]] contains those cases that occurred at [[kindergarten]]s, [[school]]s and [[University|universities]], as well as their affiliated buildings. If the perpetrator was a member of the school staff and the victims primarily his colleagues, the case is not included here, but it is added to the [[List of rampage killers: Workplace killings|list of rampage workplace killings]].

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and least ten victims overall (dead plus injured)
* Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured)
* An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed.
* In all cases the perpetrator is not counted among those killed or injured.

All abbreviations used in the table are explained [[#Abbreviations and footnotes|below]]. &lt;!--Additions should be made 1) in order of # of fatalities, and 2) # injured--&gt;

'''Lèse-majesté''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|ɛ|z|ˌ|m|æ|ʒ|ɛ|s|ˈ|t|eɪ}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lese-majeste ''Collin's English Dicitonary'']&lt;/ref&gt; or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|i:|z|_|ˈ|m|æ|dʒ|ᵻ|s|t|i}};&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|lese-majesty}}&lt;/ref&gt; also '''lese-majesty''', '''lese majesty''' or '''leze majesty''') is the crime of violating [[majesty]], an offence against the dignity of a reigning [[monarch|sovereign]] or against a state.

This behaviour was first classified as a criminal offence against the dignity of the [[Roman Republic]] of [[Ancient Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5PwrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA735&amp;lpg=PA735&amp;dq=laesa+maiestas&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1sprtKMss5&amp;sig=h8EYzeDMApaifbzOgjbwEoiGRlc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wRFXVenrJ4WDsAXCioGwBg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=laesa%20maiestas&amp;f=false Oxford Concise Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities] A complex development as distinct from treason occurred from kingdom thru empire. Arguably there was no distinction in the republican period.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Dominate]], or Late Empire period, the [[Roman Emperor|emperors]] eliminated the Republican trappings of their predecessors and began to identify the state with their person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://columbia.thefreedictionary.com/lese+majesty TheFreeDictionary.com], "Lese majesty" [[TheFreeDictionary.com]], [[Columbia Encyclopedia]], retrieved 22 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Although legally the ''[[princeps civitatis]]'' (his official title, meaning, roughly, 'first citizen') could never become a sovereign because  the republic was never officially abolished, emperors were deified as [[apotheosis|divus]], first posthumously but by the Dominate period while reigning. Deified emperors enjoyed the same legal protection that was accorded to the divinities of the [[Imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|state cult]]; by the time it was replaced by Christianity, what was in all but name a monarchical tradition had already become well-established.

Narrower conceptions of offences against Majesty as offences against the crown predominated in the European kingdoms that emerged in the early medieval period. In [[Feudalism|feudal]] Europe, some crimes were classified as lèse-majesté even if they were not intentionally directed against the crown. An example is counterfeiting, so classified because coins bore the monarch's effigy and/or coat of arms.

With the disappearance of [[absolute monarchy]] in Europe, lèse-majesté came to be viewed as less of a crime. However, certain malicious acts that would have once been classified as the crime of lèse-majesté could still be prosecuted as [[treason]]. Future republics that emerged as great powers generally still classified as a crime any offence against the highest representatives of the state. These laws are still applied as well in monarchies outside of Europe, such as modern [[Thailand]] and [[Cambodia]].

====Denmark====
In [[Denmark]], the monarch is protected by the usual [[libel]] paragraph (§ 267 of the [[Danish penalty law|penal code]] which allows for up to four months of imprisonment), but §115&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=113401|title=Resinformation.dk|work=retsinformation.dk|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows for doubling of the usual punishment when the regent is target of the libel. When a [[queen consort]], [[queen dowager]] or the crown prince is the target, the punishment may be increased by 50%. There are no historical records of §115 having ever been used, but in March 2011, [[Greenpeace]] activists who unfurled a banner at a dinner at the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] were charged under this section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=COP-15 activists in lèse majesté case|newspaper=[[Politiken]]|url=http://politiken.dk/newsinenglish/ECE1209764/cop-15-activists-in-lse-majest-case/|date=1 March 2011|accessdate=1 March 2011|location=Copenhagen}}&lt;/ref&gt; They received minor sentences for other crimes, but were acquitted of the charge relating to the monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Københavns Byret (22-08-2011).

====Jordan====
In September 2012, pro-reform activists faced charges of lèse-majesté following protests in two locations in Jordan. The protests turned violent after the activists reportedly chanted slogans against the Jordanian regime and insulted King [[Abdullah II of Jordan|Abdullah II]] and the Royal Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.ammonnews.net/article.aspx?articleNO=17751 |title=Tafileh Reform Activists to be Charged with Slander, Lese Majeste &amp;#124; Jordan News &amp;#124; Ammon News |publisher=En.ammonnews.net |date=2012-09-13 |accessdate=2014-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Morocco====
Moroccans are routinely prosecuted for statements deemed offensive to the King. The minimum penalty for such a statement is one year's imprisonment if the statement is made in private (i.e. not broadcast), and three years' imprisonment if it is made in public. In both cases, the maximum is 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcb.ub.es/idp/docs/marroc/code_presse.pdf PCB.UB.es] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106113409/http://www.pcb.ub.es/idp/docs/marroc/code_presse.pdf |date=6 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, an 18-year-old was charged with "breach of due respect to the king" for writing "God, Homeland, [[FC Barcelona|Barça]]" on a school board, in reference to his favorite football club and satirising the [[national motto]] ("God, Homeland, King").

In February 2012, 18-year-old Walid Bahomane was convicted for posting two mild cartoons of the king on Facebook.

{{main article|Lèse majesté in Thailand}}
[[Thailand]]'s [[Law of Thailand|criminal code]] has carried a prohibition against lèse-majesté since 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6547413.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Asia-Pacific - Thailand's king pardons Swiss man|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, when [[Monarchy of Thailand|Thailand's monarchy]] ceased to be absolute and a [[Constitution of Thailand|constitution]] was adopted, it too included language prohibiting lèse-majesté. The [[Thai constitutional referendum, 2016|2016 Constitution of Thailand]], and all previous versions since 1932, contain the clause, "The King shall be enthroned in a position of revered worship and shall not be violated. No person shall expose the King to any sort of accusation or action." Thai criminal code elaborates in Article 112: "Whoever defames, insults or threatens the King, Queen, the Heir-apparent or the Regent, shall be punished with imprisonment of three to fifteen years." Missing from the code, however, is a definition of what actions constitute "defamation" or "insult".&lt;ref name="BBC_JHead"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Head|first1=Jonathan|title=Writer held for 'insulting' Thai royals|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7604935.stm|accessdate=26 October 2016|work=BBC|date=9 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1990 to 2005, the Thai court system only saw four or five lèse-majesté cases a year. From January 2006 to May 2011, however, more than 400 cases came to trial, an estimated 15 times increase.&lt;ref name="increase"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110527/ap_on_re_as/as_thailand_monarchy |title=Thailand arrests American for alleged king insult |author=Todd Pitman and Sinfah Tunsarawuth |date=27 March 2011 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observers attribute the increase to increased polarization following the [[2006 Thai coup d'état|2006 military coup]] and sensitivity over the elderly king's declining health.&lt;ref name="increase"/&gt; In 2013, the [[Supreme Court of Thailand]] ruled in case no. 6374/2556 that Article 112 of the Penal Code protects the past kings as well as the present one. Criticisms or comments which tarnish past kings or the monarchy is punishable by law. However, scholars raised doubts as to how far back lèse-majesté will be applied as the present Thai monarchy ([[Chakri Dynasty]]) dates back more than 200 years while other monarchies which ruled Siam can be traced back almost 800 years.

Neither the king nor any member of the royal family has ever personally filed any charges under this law. In fact, during his birthday speech in 2005, King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] encouraged criticism: "Actually, I must also be criticized. I am not afraid if the criticism concerns what I do wrong, because then I know." He later added, "But the King ''can'' do wrong", in reference to those he was appealing to not to overlook his human nature.&lt;ref name="wrong"&gt;{{cite web |date=5 December 2005 |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/12/05/headlines/data/headlines_19334288.html|title=Royal Birthday Address: 'King Can Do Wrong'|publisher=National Media|accessdate=26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the NCPO junta which [[2014 Thai coup d'état|overthrew the democratic regime in May 2014]], charges of lèse-majesté have increased significantly, especially against the opponents of the junta. Lèse-majesté is now seeing increasing use as a tool to stifle free speech and dissent in the country.&lt;ref name="Mother of Dissident"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Thai cleaning lady facing prison for 'I see'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36328865|accessdate=21 May 2016|agency=BBC|publisher=BBC|date=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the parents of the former princess Srirasmi Suwadee as well as her uncle have been charged with lèse-majesté. On March 9, 2015, a court sentenced her father Apiruj Suwadee and mother Wanthanee for insulting the royal family and lodging a malicious claim. They pleaded guilty to the offenses named and were sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-31828475|title=Parents of Thai ex-princess given jail term for lese majeste|date=11 March 2015|publisher=|accessdate=26 January 2017|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 9, 2017 in Bangkok a 33-year-old Thai man by the first name of Wichai was given 35 years imprisonment for posting 10 Facebook photos and comments about the Thai royalty. This sentence was reduced from initial 70 years following a guilty plea made after a year in jail before the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simth|first1=Nicola|title=Man handed 35-year sentence for insulting Thai royal family on Facebook|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/09/man-handed-35-year-sentence-insulting-thai-royal-family-facebook/|agency=Telegraph|date=June 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2017 the [[United Nations]] has called on Thailand to amend its law on lèse-majesté.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40298570#&lt;/ref&gt;

==Former laws==

===Japan===
Laws against offending the emperor were in place between 1880 and 1947, when the law was abolished, during the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Occupation of Japan|occupation]]. The last person to be convicted of the crime was Shōtarō Matsushima, a factory worker and member of the [[Japanese Communist Party]]. During a 1946 protest against food shortages in front of the Imperial Palace, during which the protesters demanded entry into the palace kitchens which were said to be stocked with staple foods, Matsushima wielded a placard reading, on the one side, "Imperial Edict: The Emperor system has been preserved. I, the Emperor, have eaten to my heart's content, but you, my subjects, should starve to death! Signed, (Imperial Seal)". The other side demanded that the Emperor give a public accounting of the food shortages. Matsushima was arrested and charged with impairing the dignity of the Emperor. The Allied occupation authorities intervened and had the charges reduced to libel. Matsushima was convicted and sentenced to eight months in prison, but was pardoned immediately under an Imperial amnesty commemorating the new Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;p. 242, Eiji Takemae: The Allied Occupation of Japan (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
{{Main article|Lèse majesté in Norway}}

Following the [[Penal Code (Norway)|2005 Penal Code]] (introduced in 2015), lèse majesté is no longer considered a criminal offense.

The 1902 Penal Code, article 101, provided a fine or up to five years of prison for lèse majesté.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-19020522-010-013.html#101 Straffeloven, § 101] at ''Lovdata.no''&lt;/ref&gt; According to article 103, prosecution had to be ordered or accepted by the King.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-19020522-010-013.html#103 Straffeloven, § 103] at ''Lovdata.no''&lt;/ref&gt; Article 101 stated: "If any defamation is exercised against the King or the Regent, the guilty is punished with a fine or up to five years of prison."&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-no|Forøves nogen Ærekrenkelse mod Kongen eller Regenten, straffes den skyldige med Hefte eller Fængsel indtil 5 Aar.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Section 51 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 abolished the common law criminal offences of [[sedition]] and "leasing-making". The latter offence, also known as "lease {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|z}} making", was considered an offence of lèse-majesté or making remarks critical of the [[monarch of the United Kingdom]].  The final prosecution for this offence had occurred in 1715.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/28862.aspx?r=5495&amp;mode=html|title=Justice Committee Official Report|date=20 April 2010|publisher=Scottish Parliament|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Muhlenberg legend''' is an [[urban legend]] in the [[United States]] and [[Germany]].  According to the legend, the single vote of [[Frederick Muhlenberg]], the first ever [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives]], prevented [[German language|German]] from becoming an [[Languages_of_the_United_States#Official_language_status|official language of the United States]].

==Basis of legend==

The kernel of truth behind this legend is a vote in the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1794, after a group of German immigrants asked for the translation of some laws into German.  This petition was debated by the House of Representatives without a decision made  and a vote to adjourn and consider the recommendation at a later date was defeated by one vote, 42 to 41. There was no vote on an actual bill, merely a vote on whether or not to adjourn. Because the motion to adjourn did not pass, the matter was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snopes.com/language/apocryph/german.asp&lt;/ref&gt;  It was from this roll call on adjournment that the “German missed becoming the official language of the USA by one vote” legend sprang. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.snopes.com/language/apocryph/german.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhlenberg (of German descent himself, who had not voted in the roll call) was later quoted as having said "the faster the Germans become Americans, the better it will be."&lt;ref name="1983art1"&gt;Heath, Shirley Brice &amp; Frederick Mandabach. ''Language Status Decisions and the Law in the United States'', in Cobarrubias, Juan &amp; Joshua A. Fishman, eds., [https://books.google.com/books?id=x9KoAkzfVqIC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Progress in Language Planning], p. 94 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sick"&gt;[[Bastian Sick|Sick, Bastian]] (19 May 2004).

The United States has no statutory official language; English has been used on a ''de facto'' basis, owing to its status as the country's predominant language.  At times various states have passed their own official language laws.&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.snopes.com/language/apocryph/german.asp |date=July 9, 2007 |title= The German Vote |publisher= [[Snopes.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:FranzvonLöher.jpg|thumb|right|Franz Löher, whose 1847 German book included an early version of the story.]] 

The legend has a long history, and led to a number of analyses and articles published from the late 1920s into the early 1950s explaining why the story was not true.&lt;ref name="werner1"&gt;(18 February 1943).  [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19430218&amp;id=5wUoAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8iIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2550,4435404 A German Language Rumor Traced Down], by W.L. Werner in ''[[American Speech]]'' magazine, reprinted in ''The Milwaukee Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="feer"&gt;Feer, Robert A.

R. ''German as the Official Language of the United States of America?'', ''Monatshefte'', Vol. 68, No. 2 (Summer, 1976), pp. 129–150 (Arndt's article attempts to trace pre-Loher accounts which may have helped foster the legend, including an 1813 article by [[Justus Christian Henry Helmuth]]; at n. 21, Arndt lists seven accounts published between 1927–52 debunking the myth, starting with the 2nd edition of [[Albert Bernhardt Faust]]'s ''[[The German Element in the United States]]'', at Vol. II, pp. 652–56 (1927))&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lohr"&gt;Lohr, Otto. ''Deutsch als 'Landessprache' der Vereinigten Staaten?'', Mitteilungen der Akademie zur wissenschaftlichen Erforschung und zur Pflege des Deutschtums 4 (1931): 283–90 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; The story was dubbed the "Muhlenberg legend" by at least the late 1940s.&lt;ref name="wood"&gt;Wood, Ralph C. ''The Second Period of the German Society of Pennsylvania and the Muhlenberg Legend'', publication?, cited in ''The German American Review'', 1949&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the legend persists.&lt;ref name="1981article"&gt;(8 August 1981). Zepezauer, Frank S. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19810808&amp;id=OFwaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uCkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4509,4232784 When German almost became our language], ''Milwaukee Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="watz"&gt;[[Dennis Baron|Baron, Dennis]] (March 1996). [http://www.watzmann.net/scg/german-by-one-vote.html watzmann.net: Urban Legend: German almost became the official language of the US], watzmann.net (reprinting 1996 essay by Dennis Baron, full account of the legend and its origin)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ui"&gt;Adams, Willi Paul et al.

For example, in 1987, a letter from a former election official in Missouri emphasized the importance of voting in an [[Ann Landers]] column.  He included a list of events allegedly decided by one vote from his local election manual, including that “in 1776, one vote gave America the English language instead of German."  (In fact, versions of this error-filled list long predate the 1987 Ann Landers mention.)&lt;ref name="1968list"&gt;(19 March 1968). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1979&amp;dat=19680319&amp;id=qZkiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=y6oFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3132,7390451 Single Votes Have Made History], ''Sumter Daily Item''&lt;/ref&gt; This led to another round of news stories again pointing out that this was a myth.&lt;ref name="pbsbaron"&gt;Baron, Dennis. [https://www.pbs.org/speak/seatosea/officialamerican/englishonly/#baron The Legendary English-Only Vote of 1795], pbs.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="landers"&gt;(7 April 1987).

[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19961104&amp;id=i9FPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iQcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6831,3355790 Debate continues on Internet pros and cons], ''Ocala Star-Banner''&lt;/ref&gt;  A chorus of dismayed responses caused Landers to clear up the matter in a subsequent column.  According to one letter writer, who begged Landers to "stomp out that piece of fiction wherever you encounter it," the myth gained traction in the 1930s due to the work of Nazi propagandists. &lt;ref name="annagain"&gt;(30 December 1996). [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-12-30/features/9612300043_1_house-vote-official-language-dear-ann-landers Here's A Good Book That Will Grab You], ''Chicago Tribune''&lt;/ref&gt;

Another version of the myth, which puts the vote in 1774 by the [[Continental Congress]], appeared in ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'' as early as 1930.&lt;ref name="wasit"&gt;Zagofsky, Al (5 February 2011). [http://www.tnonline.com/2011/feb/05/was-german-almost-official-language-us Was German almost the official language of the U.S.?], ''Times-News''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carnegie"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=E2GkU7WcBfTIsASn7IKQAw&amp;id=3rYaAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=defeated+by+a+majority+of+only+one+vote+in+the+first+Continental+Congress&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Continental+Congress Believe It or Not: A Refutation of Mr. Ripley's Very Absurd Fabrication Concerning the Continental Congress], ''Carnegie Magazine'' (1930)&lt;/ref&gt; Ripley's included the myth in a 1982 book as well.  Ripley's version credits the story to an alleged letter by Heinrich Melchior Muhlenberg published in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] in 1887.&lt;ref name="bookofchance"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_v9BwIzTjBUC&amp; Ripley's believe it or not! book of chance] (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

Most accounts credit [[Franz von Löher]] as the source of the legend.  Löher was a German visitor to the [[United States]] who published the book ''Geschichte und Zustände der Deutschen in Amerika'' (''History and Achievements of the Germans in America'') in 1847.&lt;ref name="loher1"&gt;Loher, Franz. [https://archive.org/details/geschichteundzus01lh Geschichte und Zustände der Deutschen in Amerika] (1847) (in German) via archive.org&lt;/ref&gt; Löher seemingly placed the crucial vote only in Pennsylvania, to make German the official language of that state, not the United States as a whole.  (Philadelphia was where the U.S. Congress sat at the time, but it was also the capital of Pennsylvania.  To further confuse matters, Muhlenburg did serve as Speaker of the Pennsylvania House before serving in that title for the U.S. Congress.)  According to Löher, the vote was tied, and Muhlenberg cast the tie-breaking vote for English.&lt;ref name="menck"&gt;Mencken, Henry L. [https://books.google.com/books?id=n37tIO4KhU8C&amp;pg=PA139&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The American Language: Supplement One], pp. 138–39 (1945)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Vices=====

{{Main|Vice|Sufism}}
* [[Anger]] &amp;ndash; emotional response related to one's psychological interpretation of having been threatened. Often it indicates when one's basic boundaries are violated. Some have a learned tendency to react to anger through retaliation. Anger may be utilized effectively when utilized to set boundaries or escape from dangerous situations.
* [[Jealousy]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; emotion, and the word typically refers to the negative thoughts and feelings of insecurity, fear, and anxiety over an anticipated loss of something of great personal value, particularly in reference to a human connection. Jealousy often consists of a combination of emotions such as anger, resentment, inadequacy, helplessness and disgust.
* [[Laziness]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; disinclination to activity or exertion despite having the ability to do so. It is often used as a pejorative; related terms for a person seen to be lazy include couch potato, slacker, and bludger.
* [[Selfishness]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Seven Deadly Sins]]
*# [[Lust]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; emotion or feeling of intense desire in the body. The lust can take any form such as the lust for knowledge, the lust for sex or the lust for power. It can take such mundane forms as the lust for food as distinct from the need for food.
*# [[Gluttony]]&amp;nbsp;– over-indulgence and over-consumption of food, drink, or wealth items to the point of extravagance or waste. In some Christian denominations, it is considered one of the seven deadly sins—a misplaced desire of food or its withholding from the needy.
*# [[Greed]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; also known as avarice, cupidity, or covetousness, is the inordinate desire to possess wealth, goods, or objects of abstract value with the intent to keep it for one's self, far beyond the dictates of basic survival and comfort. It is applied to a markedly high desire for and pursuit of wealth, status, and power. ''See also, [[Greed (deadly sin)]].''
*# [[Sloth (deadly sin)|Sloth]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; spiritual or emotional apathy, neglecting what God has spoken, and being physically and emotionally inactive. It can also be either an outright refusal or merely a carelessness in the performance of one's obligations, especially spiritual, moral or legal obligations. Sloth can also indicate a wasting due to lack of use, concerning a person, place, thing, skill, or intangible ideal that would require maintenance, refinement, or support to continue to exist.
*# [[Seven deadly sins#Wrath|Wrath]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; also known as "rage", may be described as inordinate and uncontrolled feelings of hatred and anger. Wrath, in its purest form, presents with self-destructiveness, violence, and hate that may provoke feuds that can go on for centuries. Wrath may persist long after the person who did another a grievous wrong is dead. Feelings of anger can manifest in different ways, including impatience, revenge, and self-destructive behavior, such as drug abuse or suicide.
*# [[Envy]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; emotion which "occurs when a person lacks another's superior quality, achievement, or possession and either desires it or wishes that the other lacked it"
*# [[Pride]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; inflated sense of one's personal status or accomplishments, often used synonymously with hubris.
* [[Vanity]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; excessive belief in one's own abilities or attractiveness to others.

== Individual rights ==
{{see also|Outline of rights|Human rights}}

[[Individual rights]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; much of the western world values the concept of individual rights. These rights vary from culture to culture, and by very definition, from person to person, and appear mainly in individualist societies. In considering the self, the most intimate legal relation would be what is codified as '[[sui juris]]', or what laws have a purposed place so far as they are derived of the self.  In such cultures, it is generally considered that each and every individual has the following rights:
*[[right to life|Security rights]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; protect people against crimes such as [[abuse]], murder, massacre, and [[torture]]
** [[Security of person]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; liberty, including the right, if one is imprisoned unlawfully, to the remedy of habeas corpus. Security of person can also be seen as an expansion of rights based on prohibitions of torture and cruel and unusual punishment. Rights to security of person can guard against less lethal conduct, and can be used in regard to prisoners' rights.
* [[Human rights#Theory of value and property|Bodily and property rights]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; encompass "ownership" of your own body and choosing what to do with it, as well as the fruits of the labour that spring forth from using your own body. ("Every man has a property in his own person. This nobody has a right to, but himself," per [[John Locke]], [[Second Treatise on Civil Government]])
** [[Self-ownership]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; moral or natural right of a person to have bodily integrity, and be the exclusive controller of his own body and life. Also known as "sovereignty of the individual", "individual sovereignty", and "individual autonomy".
*[[Liberty]] rights of the [[The Enlightenment|Classical]] era&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; protect freedoms in areas such as [[freedom of conscience|belief and religion]], [[freedom of association|association]], [[freedom of assembly|assembling]], [[freedom of movement|movement]], and other [[self-determination]] (as an individual person), [[privacy]] from government and others, and [[negative liberty|freedoms from]] other [[paternalist]] meddling generally, whether by governments or others; also encompasses security, bodily and property, political, and due process rights, many group rights, some welfare rights, and (especially outside of the US in the Classical era) equality rights, as all of those categories appear in this list
*[[Political]] rights&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; protect the liberty to participate in politics by [[freedom of expression|expressing themselves]], protesting, voting and serving in public office
*[[Due process]] rights&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; protect against abuses of the legal system such as imprisonment without trial, secret trials and excessive punishments; often overlaps with the bodily rights, listed above
*[[Social equality|Equality]] rights&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; guarantee equal citizenship, equality before the [[law]] and nondiscrimination in regards to one's eligibility for all of the other rights in this list
*[[Quality of life|Welfare]] rights (also known as economic or social rights)&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; require the provision of [[education]] and protections against severe [[poverty]] and [[starvation]]; generally an expansion of [[positive liberties]]
*[[collective rights|Group rights]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; provide protection for groups against ethnic [[genocide]], and [[self-determination]] (as a group) and the ownership by countries of their national territories and resources; may overlap with the bodily and property rights, and Social equality rights, listed above

Panspermia hypotheses propose (for example) that [[microscopic life|microscopic life-forms]] that can survive the effects of space (such as [[extremophile]]s) can become trapped in debris ejected into space after collisions between planets and [[small Solar System bodies]] that harbor life. Some [[organism]]s may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets or intermingling with [[protoplanetary disk]]s. Under certain ideal impact circumstances (into a body of water, for example), and ideal conditions on a new planet's surfaces, it is possible that the surviving organisms could become active and begin to colonize their new environment. Panspermia studies concentrate not on  [[abiogenesis|how life began]], but on the methods that may cause its distribution in the Universe.&lt;ref name="Wesson"&gt;A variation of the panspermia hypothesis is '''necropanspermia''' which astronomer Paul Wesson describes as follows: "The vast majority of organisms reach a new home in the Milky Way in a technically dead state … Resurrection may, however, be possible." {{cite news|last= Grossman |first= Lisa |title = All Life on Earth Could Have Come From Alien Zombies |publisher= ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' |date= 2010-11-10 |url= https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/11/necropanspermia/|accessdate= 10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoyle, F 1981. pp35-49"&gt;Hoyle, F. and Wickramasinghe, N.C.

Pseudo-panspermia (sometimes called ''"soft panspermia"'' or ''"molecular panspermia"'') argues that the pre-biotic organic building-blocks of life originated in space, became incorporated in the solar nebula from which planets condensed, and were further—and continuously—distributed to planetary surfaces where life then emerged ([[abiogenesis]]).&lt;ref name="Klyce 2001"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.panspermia.org/oseti.htm | title = Panspermia Asks New Questions | accessdate= 25 July 2013 | last = Klyce | first = Brig | date = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |doi= 10.1117/12.435366 |chapter= Panspermia asks new questions |title= The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) in the Optical Spectrum III |journal= Proc.

The chemistry leading to [[life]] may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when the Universe was only 10 to 17 million years old. Though the presence of life is confirmed only on the Earth, some scientists think that extraterrestrial life is not only plausible, but probable or inevitable. Probes and instruments have started examining other planets and moons in the Solar System and in other planetary systems for evidence of having once supported simple life, and projects such as [[SETI]] attempt to detect [[radio transmission]]s from possible extraterrestrial civilizations.

The first known mention of the term was in the writings of the 5th-century BC [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Anaxagoras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Leary |first=Margater |year=2008 |title=Anaxagoras and the Origin of Panspermia Theory |publisher=iUniverse Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-595-49596-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panspermia began to assume a more scientific form through the proposals of [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]] (1834),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Berzelius| first =J.

In an Origins Symposium presentation on April 7, 2009, physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] stated his opinion about what humans may find when venturing into space, such as the possibility of alien life through the theory of panspermia: "Life could spread from planet to planet or from stellar system to stellar system, carried on meteors."&lt;ref name="Stephen Hawking"&gt;{{cite news|last=Weaver|first=Rheyanne|title=Ruminations on other worlds|url=http://www.statepress.com/archive/node/5745|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724233755/http://www.statepress.com/archive/node/5745|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 24, 2011|accessdate=25 July 2013|newspaper=statepress.com|date=April 7, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, a Russian team published a paper which disclosed that they found DNA on the exterior of the ISS from land and marine bacteria similar to those previously observed in superficial micro layers at the Barents and Kara seas' coastal zones.

=== Radiopanspermia ===
In 1903, [[Svante Arrhenius]] published in his article ''The Distribution of Life in Space'',&lt;ref&gt;"Die Verbreitung des Lebens im Weltenraum" (the "Distribution of Life in Space"). Published in ''Die Umschau''. 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; the hypothesis now called radiopanspermia, that microscopic forms of life can be propagated in space, driven by the [[radiation pressure]] from stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nicholson | first1 = Wayne L. | year = 2009 | title = Ancient micronauts: interplanetary transport of microbes by cosmic impacts | journal = Trends in Microbiology | volume = 17 | issue = 6| pages = 243–250 | doi = 10.1016/j.tim.2009.03.004 | pmid = 19464895 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrhenius argued that particles at a critical size below 1.5 μm would be propagated at high speed by radiation pressure of the Sun. However, because its effectiveness decreases with increasing size of the particle, this mechanism holds for very tiny particles only, such as single bacterial spores.&lt;ref name='Gerda Horneck' /&gt; The main criticism of radiopanspermia hypothesis came from [[Iosif Shklovsky]] and [[Carl Sagan]], who pointed out the proofs of the lethal action of space radiations ([[UV]] and [[X-ray]]s) in the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Shklovskii, I.

Then, data gathered by the orbital experiments [[Exobiology Radiation Assembly|ERA]], [[BIOPAN]], [[EXOSTACK]] and [[EXPOSE]], determined that isolated spores, including those of ''[[B. subtilis]]'', were killed by several orders of magnitude if exposed to the full space environment for a mere few seconds, but if shielded against solar [[UV]], the spores were capable of surviving in space for up to six years while embedded in clay or meteorite powder (artificial meteorites).&lt;ref name='Gerda Horneck' /&gt;&lt;ref name=Protection&gt;{{cite journal|title=Protection of Bacterial Spores in Space, a Contribution to the Discussion on Panspermia|journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of the Biosphere : The Journal of the International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life|volume=31|issue=6|pages=527–47|bibcode=2002ESASP.518..105R|pmid=11770260|year=2001|author1=Horneck|first1=G|last2=Rettberg|first2=P|last3=Reitz|first3=G|last4=Wehner|first4=J|last5=Eschweiler|first5=U|last6=Strauch|first6=K|last7=Panitz|first7=C|last8=Starke|first8=V|last9=Baumstark-Khan|first9=C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though minimal protection is required to shelter a spore against UV radiation, exposure to solar UV and cosmic ionizing radiation of unprotected DNA, break it up into its bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rahn | first1 = R.O. | last2 = Hosszu | first2 = J.L. | year = 1969 | title = Influence of relative humidity on the photochemistry of DNA films | journal = Biochim.

Based on experimental data on radiation effects and DNA stability, it has been concluded that for such long travel times, boulder-sized rocks which are greater than or equal to 1 meter in diameter are required to effectively shield resistant microorganisms, such as bacterial spores against galactic [[cosmic radiation]].&lt;ref name='C.

=== Lithopanspermia ===

Lithopanspermia, the transfer of organisms in rocks from one planet to another either through interplanetary or interstellar space, remains speculative. Although there is no evidence that lithopanspermia has occurred in the Solar System, the various stages have become amenable to experimental testing.&lt;ref name='Experimental methods'&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.mimet.2009.10.004 |title=Experimental methods for studying microbial survival in extraterrestrial environments |date=2010 |last1=Olsson-Francis |first1=Karen |last2=Cockell |first2=Charles S. |journal=Journal of Microbiological Methods |volume=80 |pages=1–13 |pmid=19854226 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Planetary ejection''' — For lithopanspermia to occur, researchers have suggested that microorganisms must survive ejection from a planetary surface which involves extreme forces of acceleration and shock with associated temperature excursions. Hypothetical values of shock pressures experienced by ejected rocks are obtained with Martian meteorites, which suggest the shock pressures of approximately 5 to 55&amp;nbsp;GPa, acceleration of 3&amp;nbsp;Mm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and [[Jerk (physics)|jerk]] of 6&amp;nbsp;Gm/s&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and post-shock temperature increases of about 1 K to 1000 K.&lt;ref name='Cockell 2008'&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11084-007-9112-3 |pmid=17906941 |title=The Interplanetary Exchange of Photosynthesis |date=2007 |last1=Cockell |first1=Charles S. |journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=87–104|bibcode=2008OLEB...38...87C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/ast.2007.0134 |title=Microbial Rock Inhabitants Survive Hypervelocity Impacts on Mars-Like Host Planets: First Phase of Lithopanspermia Experimentally Tested |date=2008 |last1=Horneck |first1=Gerda |display-authors=4 |last2=Stöffler |first2=Dieter |last3=Ott |first3=Sieglinde |last4=Hornemann |first4=Ulrich |last5=Cockell |first5=Charles S. |last6=Moeller |first6=Ralf |last7=Meyer |first7=Cornelia |last8=De Vera |first8=Jean-Pierre |last9=Fritz |first9=Jörg |last10=Schade |first10=Sara |last11=Artemieva |first11=Natalia A. |journal=Astrobiology |volume=8 |pages=17–44 |pmid=18237257 |issue=1|bibcode=2008AsBio...8...17H }}&lt;/ref&gt; To determine the effect of acceleration during ejection on microorganisms, rifle and ultracentrifuge methods were successfully used under simulated outer space conditions.&lt;ref name="Experimental methods" /&gt;
* '''Survival in transit''' — The survival of microorganisms has been studied extensively using both simulated facilities and in low Earth orbit. A large number of microorganisms have been selected for exposure experiments. It is possible to separate these microorganisms into two groups, the human-borne, and the [[extremophiles]]. Studying the human-borne microorganisms is significant for human welfare and future manned missions; whilst the extremophiles are vital for studying the physiological requirements of survival in space.&lt;ref name="Experimental methods" /&gt;
* '''Atmospheric entry''' — An important aspect of the lithopanspermia hypothesis to test is that microbes situated on or within rocks could survive hypervelocity entry from space through Earth's atmosphere (Cockell, 2008). As with planetary ejection, this is experimentally tractable, with sounding rockets and orbital vehicles being used for microbiological experiments.&lt;ref name="Experimental methods" /&gt;&lt;ref name='Cockell 2008' /&gt; ''[[B. subtilis]]'' spores inoculated onto [[granite]] domes were subjected to hypervelocity atmospheric transit (twice) by launch to a ∼120&amp;nbsp;km altitude on an Orion two-stage rocket. The spores were shown to have survived on the sides of the rock, but they did not survive on the forward-facing surface that was subjected to a maximum temperature of 145&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/ast.2005.5.726 |title=Bacillus subtilis Spores on Artificial Meteorites Survive Hypervelocity Atmospheric Entry: Implications for Lithopanspermia |date=2005 |last1=Fajardo-Cavazos |first1=Patricia |last2=Link |first2=Lindsey |last3=Melosh |first3=H.

During reentry, the rock samples were subjected to temperatures and pressure loads comparable to those experienced in meteorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0032-0633(02)00018-1 |title=Do meteoroids of sedimentary origin survive terrestrial atmospheric entry?

As photosynthetic organisms must be close to the surface of a rock to obtain sufficient light energy, atmospheric transit might act as a filter against them by ablating the surface layers of the rock. Although [[cyanobacteria]] have been shown to survive the desiccating, freezing conditions of space in orbital experiments, this would be of no benefit as the STONE experiment showed that they cannot survive atmospheric entry.&lt;ref name='filter'&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/ast.2006.0038 |title=Interplanetary Transfer of Photosynthesis: An Experimental Demonstration of a Selective Dispersal Filter in Planetary Island Biogeography |date=2007 |last1=Cockell |first1=Charles S. |display-authors=4 |last2=Brack |first2=André |last3=Wynn-Williams |first3=David D. |last4=Baglioni |first4=Pietro |last5=Brandstätter |first5=Franz |last6=Demets |first6=René |last7=Edwards |first7=Howell G.M. |last8=Gronstal |first8=Aaron L. |last9=Kurat |first9=Gero |last10=Lee |first10=Pascal |last11=Osinski |first11=Gordon R. |last12=Pearce |first12=David A. |last13=Pillinger |first13=Judith M. |last14=Roten |first14=Claude-Alain |last15=Sancisi-Frey |first15=Suzy |journal=Astrobiology |volume=7 |pages=1–9 |pmid=17407400 |issue=1|bibcode=2007AsBio...7....1C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, non-photosynthetic organisms deep within rocks have a chance to survive the exit and entry process. (See also: [[Impact survival]].)  Research presented at the European Planetary Science Congress in 2015 suggests that ejection, entry and impact is survivable for some simple organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://astrobiology.com/2013/09/could-life-have-survived-a-fall-to-earth.html |title= Could Life Have Survived a Fall to Earth? |work=EPSC |date=12 September 2013 |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accidental panspermia ===
[[Thomas Gold]], a professor of [[astronomy]], suggested in 1960 the hypothesis of "Cosmic Garbage", that life on Earth might have originated accidentally from a pile of [[waste]] products dumped on Earth long ago by extraterrestrial beings.&lt;ref&gt;Gold, T. "Cosmic Garbage", Air Force and Space Digest, 65 (May 1960).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Directed panspermia ===
{{Main|Directed panspermia}}
Directed panspermia concerns the deliberate transport of microorganisms in space, sent to Earth to start life here, or sent from Earth to seed new planetary systems with life by [[introduced species]] of microorganisms on lifeless planets. The Nobel prize winner [[Francis Crick]], along with [[Leslie Orgel]] proposed that life may have been purposely spread by an advanced extraterrestrial civilization,&lt;ref name="Crick_Orgel" /&gt; but considering an early "[[RNA world]]" Crick noted later that life may have originated on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/reprint/7/1/238.pdf Anticipating an RNA world. Some past speculations on the origin of life: where are they today?]" by L. E. Orgel and F. H. C. Crick in ''FASEB J.'' (1993) Volume 7 pages 238–239.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that 'directed' panspermia was proposed in order to counteract various objections, including the argument that microbes would be inactivated by the space environment and [[cosmic radiation]] before they could make a chance encounter with Earth.&lt;ref name='C. Clark'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Planetary Interchange of Bioactive Material: Probability Factors and Implications | journal = Origins of Life and Evolution of the Biosphere | date = February 2001 | first = Benton C.

Conversely, active directed panspermia has been proposed to secure and expand life in space.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; This may be motivated by biotic ethics that values, and seeks to propagate, the basic patterns of our organic gene/protein life-form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mautner | first = Michael N. | title =Life-centered ethics, and the human future in space | journal = Bioethics | volume = 23 | pages = 433–440 | date = 2009 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8519.2008.00688.x | pmid=19077128 | url = http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFLifeCenteredBioethics2009Paper.pdf |issue =8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panbiotic program would seed new planetary systems nearby, and clusters of new stars in interstellar clouds. These young targets, where local life would not have formed yet, avoid any interference with local life.

For example, microbial payloads launched by solar sails at speeds up to 0.0001 ''c'' (30,000&amp;nbsp;m/s) would reach targets at 10 to 100 light-years in 0.1 million to 1 million years. Fleets of microbial capsules can be aimed at clusters of new stars in star-forming clouds, where they may land on planets or be captured by asteroids and comets and later delivered to planets. Payloads may contain [[extremophile]]s for diverse environments and [[cyanobacteria]] similar to early microorganisms. Hardy multicellular organisms (rotifer cysts) may be included to induce higher evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Mautner | first = Michael Noah Ph.D.| author-link =Michael Noah Mautner | title =Seeding the Universe with Life: Securing our Cosmological Future | publisher=Legacy Books (www.amazon.com) | date = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-476-00330-9 | url = http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFSeedingtheUniverse2005Book.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The probability of hitting the target zone can be calculated from &lt;math&gt;P(\text{target}) = \frac{A(\text{target})}{\pi (dy)^2} = \frac{a r(\text{target})^2 v^2}{(tp)^2 d^4}&lt;/math&gt; where ''A''(target) is the cross-section of the target area, ''dy'' is the positional uncertainty at arrival; ''a'' – constant (depending on units), ''r''(target) is the radius of the target area; ''v'' the velocity of the probe; (tp) the targeting precision (arcsec/yr); and ''d'' the distance to the target, guided by high-resolution astrometry of 1×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; arcsec/yr (all units in SIU). These calculations show that relatively near target stars(Alpha PsA, Beta Pictoris) can be seeded by milligrams of launched microbes; while seeding the Rho Ophiochus star-forming cloud requires hundreds of kilograms of dispersed capsules.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

=== Pseudo-panspermia ===
{{further| List of interstellar and circumstellar molecules|Abiogenesis#Extraterrestrial organic molecules}}

Pseudo-panspermia (sometimes called soft panspermia, molecular panspermia or quasi-panspermia) proposes that the organic molecules used for life originated in space and were incorporated in the solar nebula, from which the planets condensed and were further —and continuously— distributed to planetary surfaces where life then emerged ([[abiogenesis]]).&lt;ref name="Klyce 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; From the early 1970s it was becoming evident that interstellar dust consisted of a large component of organic molecules. The first suggestion came from [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]], who proposed a polymeric composition based on the molecule [[formaldehyde]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wickramasinghe | first1 = N.C. | year = 1974 | title = Formaldehyde Polymers in Interstellar Space | journal = Nature | volume = 252 | issue = 5483| pages = 462–463 | doi=10.1038/252462a0| bibcode = 1974Natur.252..462W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interstellar molecules are formed by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar clouds of dust and gas. Usually this occurs when a molecule becomes [[ion]]ized, often as the result of an interaction with [[cosmic ray]]s. This positively charged molecule then draws in a nearby reactant by electrostatic attraction of the neutral molecule's electrons. Molecules can also be generated by reactions between neutral atoms and molecules, although this process is generally slower.&lt;ref name="pnas103"/&gt; The dust plays a critical role of shielding the molecules from the ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.&lt;ref name="brown_pais95"/&gt;

A 2008 analysis of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C isotopic ratios of organic compounds found in the [[Murchison meteorite]] indicates a non-terrestrial origin for these molecules rather than terrestrial contamination.

In August 2012, and in a world first, astronomers at [[Copenhagen University]] reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, [[glycolaldehyde]], in a distant star system.

In 2013, the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA Project) confirmed that researchers have discovered an important pair of prebiotic molecules in the icy particles in [[interstellar space]] (ISM). The chemicals, found in a giant cloud of gas about 25,000 light-years from Earth in ISM, may be a precursor to a key component of DNA and the other may have a role in the formation of an important [[amino acid]]. Researchers found a molecule called cyanomethanimine, which produces [[adenine]], one of the four [[nucleobases]] that form the "rungs" in the ladder-like structure of DNA. The other molecule, called [[ethanamine]], is thought to play a role in forming [[alanine]], one of the twenty amino acids in the genetic code. Previously, scientists thought such processes took place in the very tenuous gas between the stars. The new discoveries, however, suggest that the chemical formation sequences for these molecules occurred not in gas, but on the surfaces of ice grains in interstellar space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/765/1/L9 |title=The Detection of Interstellar Ethanimine (Ch3Chnh) from Observations Taken During the Gbt Primos Survey |date=2013 |last1=Loomis |first1=Ryan A. |display-authors=4 |last2=Zaleski|first2=Daniel P. |last3=Steber |first3=Amanda L. |last4=Neill |first4=Justin L. |last5=Muckle|first5=Matthew T. |last6=Harris |first6=Brent J. |last7=Hollis |first7=Jan M. |last8=Jewell |first8=Philip R.|last9=Lattanzi|first9=Valerio |last10=Lovas |first10=Frank J. |last11=Martinez |first11=Oscar|last12=McCarthy|first12=Michael C. |last13=Remijan |first13=Anthony J. |last14=Pate |first14=Brooks H.|last15=Corby|first15=Joanna F. |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=765 |issue=1 |pages=L9|bibcode=2013ApJ...765L...9L|arxiv=1302.1121}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA ALMA scientist Anthony Remijan stated that finding these molecules in an interstellar gas cloud means that important building blocks for DNA and amino acids can 'seed' newly formed planets with the chemical precursors for life.&lt;ref&gt;Finley, Dave (February 28, 2013) [https://www.nrao.edu/pr/2013/newchem/ Discoveries Suggest Icy Cosmic Start for Amino Acids and DNA Ingredients].

=== Hypotheses on extraterrestrial sources of illnesses ===
Hoyle and Wickramasinghe have speculated that several outbreaks of illnesses on Earth are of extraterrestrial origins, including the [[1918 flu pandemic]], and certain outbreaks of [[polio]] and [[mad cow disease]].  For the 1918 flu pandemic they hypothesized that [[comet]]ary dust brought the virus to Earth simultaneously at multiple locations—a view almost universally dismissed by experts on this pandemic. Hoyle also speculated that [[HIV]] came from outer space.&lt;ref name="Byrne2008"&gt;{{cite book| first =Joseph Patrick | last = Byrne |title= Encyclopedia of Pestilence, Pandemics, and Plagues | type = entry | chapter = Panspermia |url= https://books.google.com/?id=HlTIYgEACAAJ |pages= 454–55| isbn = 9780313341014 | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Hoyle's death, ''[[The Lancet]]'' published a [[letter to the editor]] from Wickramasinghe and two of his colleagues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Wickramasinghe |first1= C| last2=Wainwright | first2 = M| last3=Narlikar | first3 = J |title= SARS—a clue to its origins?|journal=Lancet|date=May 24, 2003 |volume= 361|issue=9371|pages=1832|pmid=12781581|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13440-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they hypothesized that the [[virus]] that causes [[severe acute respiratory syndrome]] (SARS) could be extraterrestrial in origin and not originated from chickens.

=== Case studies ===
* A [[meteorite]] originating from [[Mars]] known as [[ALH84001]] was shown in 1996 to contain [[microscopic]] structures resembling small terrestrial [[nanobacteria]]. When the discovery was announced, many immediately conjectured that these were [[fossil]]s and were the first evidence of [[extraterrestrial life]] — making headlines around the world. Public interest soon started to dwindle as most experts started to agree that these structures were not indicative of life, but could instead be formed abiotically from [[organic molecules]]. However, in November 2009, a team of scientists at [[Johnson Space Center]], including David McKay, reasserted that there was "strong evidence that life may have existed on ancient Mars", after having reexamined the meteorite and finding [[magnetite#Biological occurrences|magnetite]] crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=New Study Adds to Finding of Ancient Life Signs in Mars Meteorite | url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/news/releases/2009/J09-030.html | publisher=[[NASA]] | date= 2009-11-30 | accessdate= 1 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Thomas-Keprta | first1 = K.| first2=S | last2 = Clemett| first3= D | last3 = McKay| first4=E | last4 = Gibson| first5=S | last5 = Wentworth |last-author-amp= yes |date= 2009|title= Origin of Magnetite Nanocrystals in Martian Meteorite ALH84001|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|issue=21|pages=6631–6677|doi= 10.1016/j.gca.2009.05.064 |volume= 73|bibcode = 2009GeCoA..73.6631T| url = https://zenodo.org/record/1258983| type = Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A separate fragment of the [[Orgueil (meteorite)|Orgueil]] meteorite (kept in a sealed glass jar since its discovery) was found in 1965 to have a seed capsule embedded in it, whilst the original glassy layer on the outside remained undisturbed. Despite great initial excitement, the seed was found to be that of a European [[Juncaceae]] or Rush plant that had been glued into the fragment and camouflaged using [[coal dust]]. The outer "fusion layer" was in fact glue. Whilst the perpetrator of this hoax is unknown, it is thought that they sought to influence the 19th century debate on [[spontaneous generation]] — rather than panspermia — by demonstrating the transformation of inorganic to biological matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contaminated Meteorite|journal=Science|volume=146|issue=3648|pages=1157–61|doi=10.1126/science.146.3648.1157|pmid=17832241|year=1964|last1=Anders|first1=E.|last2=Dufresne|first2=E.

[[File:Blacksmoker in Atlantic Ocean.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hydrothermal vent]]s are able to support [[extremophile]] bacteria on [[Earth]] and may also support life in other parts of the cosmos.]]
Until the 1970s, [[life]] was thought to depend on its access to [[sunlight]]. Even life in the ocean depths, where sunlight cannot reach, was believed to obtain its nourishment either from consuming organic detritus rained down from the surface waters or from eating animals that did.&lt;ref name="smoker"&gt;{{cite web |title= Black Smokers and Giant Worms |author=Chamberlin, Sean |date=1999 |work=Fullerton College |url=http://www.courseworld.com/ocean/smokers.html |accessdate=11 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1977, during an exploratory dive to the [[Galapagos Rift]] in the deep-sea exploration submersible ''[[DSV Alvin|Alvin]]'', scientists discovered colonies of assorted creatures clustered around undersea volcanic features known as [[black smoker]]s.&lt;ref name="smoker" /&gt;  It was soon determined that the basis for this food chain is a form of [[bacterium]] &lt;!--Find name/species.--&gt;that derives its energy from [[Redox|oxidation]] of reactive chemicals, such as [[hydrogen]] or [[hydrogen sulfide]], that bubble up from the Earth's interior. This [[chemosynthesis]] revolutionized the study of biology by revealing that terrestrial life need not be Sun-dependent; it only requires water and an energy gradient in order to exist.

The discovery of deep-sea [[ecosystem]]s, along with advancements in the fields of [[astrobiology]], observational [[astronomy]] and discovery of large varieties of extremophiles, opened up a new avenue in astrobiology by massively expanding the number of possible [[Planetary habitability|extraterrestrial habitats]] and possible transport of hardy microbial life through vast distances.&lt;ref name="Experimental methods" /&gt;

=== Research in outer space ===
{{See also|List of microorganisms tested in outer space}}
The question of whether certain [[microorganism]]s can survive in the harsh environment of outer space has intrigued biologists since the beginning of spaceflight, and opportunities were provided to expose samples to space. The first American tests were made in 1966, during the [[Gemini IX]] and [[Gemini XII|XII]] missions, when samples of [[bacteriophage]] T1 and spores of ''[[Penicillium roqueforti]]'' were exposed to outer space for 16.8 h and 6.5 h, respectively.&lt;ref name='Gerda Horneck' /&gt;&lt;ref name="Experimental methods" /&gt; Other basic life sciences research in [[low Earth orbit]] started in 1966 with the Soviet biosatellite program [[Bion (satellite)|Bion]] and the U.S. [[Biosatellite program]]. Thus, the plausibility of panspermia can be evaluated by examining life forms on Earth for their capacity to survive in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The origin of life, panspermia and a proposal to seed the Universe | journal = Plant Science | date = December 2008 | first = David Tepfer | volume = 175 | issue = 6 | pages = 756–760 | doi = 10.1016/j.plantsci.2008.08.007 | last1 = Tepfer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following experiments carried on [[low Earth orbit]] specifically tested some aspects of panspermia or lithopanspermia:

==== ERA ====
[[File:STS-46 EURECA deployment.jpg|thumb|[[European Retrievable Carrier|EURECA]] facility deployment in 1992]]
The [[Exobiology Radiation Assembly]] (ERA) was a 1992 experiment on board the [[European Retrievable Carrier]] (EURECA) on the biological effects of [[space radiation]]. EURECA was an unmanned 4.5 tonne satellite with a payload of 15 experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1992-049B-03 | title = Exobiology and Radiation Assembly (ERA) |accessdate=22 July 2013 | date = 1992 | work = [[ESA]] | publisher = NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was an [[astrobiology]] mission developed by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA). [[Spore]]s of different strains of ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' and the ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' [[plasmid]] [[pUC19]] were exposed to selected conditions of space (space vacuum and/or defined wavebands and intensities of solar ultraviolet radiation). After the approximately 11-month mission, their responses were studied in terms of survival, [[mutagenesis]] in the ''his'' (''B. subtilis'') or ''[[lac operon|lac]]'' [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] (pUC19), induction of [[DNA]] strand breaks, efficiency of [[DNA repair]] systems, and the role of external protective agents. The data were compared with those of a simultaneously running ground control experiment:&lt;ref name=Dose&gt;{{cite journal | title = ERA-experiment "space biochemistry" | journal = Advances in Space Research | volume = 16 | issue = 8 | date= 1995 |pages = 119–129 |doi = 10.1016/0273-1177(95)00280-R | last1 = Zhang | pmid = 11542696| bibcode = 1995AdSpR..16..119D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Horneck'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Biological responses to space: results of the experiment "Exobiological Unit" of ERA on EURECA I | journal = Adv.

* The survival of spores treated with the vacuum of space, however shielded against solar radiation, is substantially increased, if they are exposed in multilayers and/or in the presence of [[glucose]] as protective.
* All spores in "artificial meteorites", i.e. embedded in [[clay]]s or simulated [[Martian soil]], are killed.
* Vacuum treatment leads to an increase of [[mutation frequency]] in spores, but not in [[plasmid]] DNA.
* Extraterrestrial solar [[ultraviolet]] radiation is [[mutagen]]ic, induces strand breaks in the DNA and reduces survival substantially.
* Action [[spectroscopy]] confirms results of previous space experiments of a synergistic action of  [[Vacuum#Outer space|space vacuum]] and [[Ultraviolet|solar UV radiation]] with [[DNA]] being the critical target.
* The decrease in viability of the microorganisms could be correlated with the increase in [[DNA repair#DNA damage|DNA damage]].
* The purple membranes, amino acids and urea were not measurably affected by the dehydrating condition of open space, if sheltered from solar radiation. Plasmid DNA, however, suffered a significant amount of strand breaks under these conditions.&lt;ref name=Dose /&gt;

==== BIOPAN ====
[[BIOPAN]] is a multi-user experimental facility installed on the external surface of the Russian [[Foton (space programs)|Foton descent capsule]]. Experiments developed for BIOPAN are designed to investigate the effect of the space environment on biological material after exposure between 13 and 17 days.&lt;ref name='Kayser'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kayser.it/index.php/life-science/facilities/biopan | title = BIOPAN Pan for exposure to space environment |accessdate=17 July 2013 | date = 2013 | work = Kayser Italia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments in BIOPAN are exposed to [[Insolation|solar]] and [[Cosmic ray|cosmic radiation]], the space vacuum and weightlessness, or a selection thereof. Of the 6 missions flown so far on BIOPAN between 1992 and 2007, dozens of experiments were conducted, and some analyzed the likelihood of panspermia. Some bacteria, [[lichen]]s (''[[Xanthoria elegans]]'', ''[[Rhizocarpon geographicum]]'' and their mycobiont cultures, the black Antarctic microfungi ''Cryomyces minteri'' and ''Cryomyces antarcticus''), spores, and even one animal ([[tardigrades]]) were found to have survived the harsh outer space environment and [[cosmic radiation]].&lt;ref name=Foton&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2008cosp...37..660D |title=Experiment lithopanspermia: Test of interplanetary transfer and re-entry process of epi- and endolithic microbial communities in the FOTON-M3 Mission |author1=De La Torre Noetzel |first1=Rosa |volume=37 |date=2008 |pages=660 |journal=37th COSPAR Scientific Assembly.

==== EXOSTACK ====
[[File:1990 s32 LDEF stow.jpg|thumb|left|EXOSTACK on the [[Long Duration Exposure Facility]] satellite.]]

The German [[EXOSTACK]] experiment was deployed on 7 April 1984 on board the [[Long Duration Exposure Facility]] statellite.  30% of ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' [[spores]] survived the nearly 6 years exposure when embedded in salt crystals, whereas 80% survived in the presence of glucose, which stabilize the structure of the cellular macromolecules, especially during vacuum-induced dehydration.&lt;ref name='Gerda Horneck'&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1128/MMBR.00016-09 |title=Space Microbiology |date=2010 |last1=Horneck |first1=G. |last2=Klaus |first2=D.

If shielded against solar [[UV]], spores of ''B. subtilis'' were capable of surviving in space for up to 6 years, especially if embedded in clay or meteorite powder (artificial meteorites).

The [[Tanpopo (mission)|Tanpopo]] mission is an orbital [[astrobiology]] experiment by Japan that is currently investigating the possible interplanetary transfer of life, [[organic compound]]s, and possible terrestrial particles in low Earth orbit. The Tanpopo experiment is taking place at the Exposed Facility located on the exterior of [[Kibo (ISS module)|Kibo module]] of the [[International Space Station]].

== Criticism ==
Panspermia is often criticized because it does not answer the question of the [[origin of life]] but merely places it on another celestial body. It was also criticized because it was thought it could not be tested experimentally.&lt;ref name='Experimental methods' /&gt;

Wallis and Wickramasinghe argued in 2004 that the transport of individual bacteria or clumps of bacteria, is overwhelmingly more important than lithopanspermia in terms of numbers of microbes transferred, even accounting for the death rate of unprotected bacteria in transit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wickramasinghe |first1=M.K. |author2=Wickramasinghe, C.| title=Interstellar transfer of planetary microbiota |journal=Mon.

These results clearly negate the original panspermia hypothesis, which requires single spores as space travelers accelerated by the radiation pressure of the Sun, requiring many years to travel between the planets. However, if shielded against solar [[UV]], spores of ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' were capable of surviving in space for up to 6 years, especially if embedded in clay or meteorite powder (artificial meteorites). The data support the likelihood of interplanetary transfer of microorganisms within [[meteorite]]s, the so-called '''lithopanspermia''' hypothesis.&lt;ref name='Gerda Horneck' /&gt;

First used by Irish-American [[psychoanalytic]] psychiatrist [[Harry Stack Sullivan]] in the 1940s, '''Parataxical Integration''' (a combination of terms) refers to the mutual condition of [[parataxic distortion]]s (another concept of Sullivan’s). Parataxical integration exists when two people, usually intimate with each other (i.e. parents and children, spouses, romantic partners, business associates), are reciprocally reactive to each other’s seductions, judgmental inaccuracies, hostile comments, and manipulations or other "triggering" behaviors. One says or does something causing the other to react, setting off a cyclical "ping-pong", "tit-for-tat", "you-get-me-and-I-get-you-back" oscillation of verbal and/or behavioral reactions.

==Development==
The concept first appeared in Sullivan's ''The Interpersonal Theory of Psychiatry'', published in 1953. It was developed further by his protégé, [[Lorna Smith Benjamin]], in her ''Interpersonal Diagnosis and Treatment of Personality Disorders'' (1996). Benjamin saw parataxical integration as typical in the interpersonal behavior of couples with unresolved [[autonomy]] (i.e. separation, [[Personal boundaries|boundary]]) and identity issues. [[Erik Erikson]] had himself described the unconscious, reciprocal reactivation (without using Sullivan’s terms) in his essay, “The Problem of Ego Identity,” and in ''Identity and Anxiety'', by Stein ''et al''. (1960).

==Usage==
Though the term itself is not used in much of the professional peer-reviewed literature, the interpersonal manifestation to which it refers appears regularly in the case study literature of the "[[family systems]]" school of psychologists, including [[Don D. Jackson]], [[Jay Haley]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Virginia Satir]], and [[Salvador Minuchin]]. Parataxical integrations are also presented in similar studies reported by [[Ronald D. Laing]], [[Aaron Esterson]], and anthropologist [[Jules Henry]], largely during the 1950s and 1960s. [[Harold Searles]] and [[Charles McCormack]] describe manifestations of parataxical integration in their works on [[borderline personality disorder]]s in the 1980s and 2000s.

[[Paul Watzlawick]] ''et al''. describes the concept in his book, ''Change'', noting, "... the circularity of their interaction makes it undecidable ... whether a given action is the cause or effect of an action by the other party ... either party sees its actions as determined and provoked by the other's actions ...".

[[Rodger Garrett]] also employs the concept in his millennial-era work on borderline personality disorder and [[family of origin]] etiology, typically using the term “reciprocal reactivity” along with it.

[[Reciprocal reactivity]] was studied by Gary Sperduto ''et al''. in the 1970s, and it is clear from the abstract of his paper (see below) that his definitional terminology equated to that of Sullivan.

Numerous mass-market psychology authors, many writing about the topic of "[[codependence|co-dependence]]," including [[Melody Beattie]], [[Pia Mellody]], [[Anne Wilson Schaef]], and [[Barry &amp; Janae Weinhold]], describe the interpersonal manifestation without using Sullivan’s term ''per se''. Co-dependence expert [[Pia Mellody]] describes the behavioral manifestations of parataxical integration at length in an audio presentation available online.

'''Patience''' (or '''[[wikt:forbearance#English|forbearance]]''') is the ability to endure difficult circumstances such as perseverance in the face of delay; tolerance of provocation without responding in annoyance/[[anger]]; or forbearance when under strain, especially when faced with longer-term difficulties. Patience is the level of endurance one can have before negativity. It is also used to refer to the [[character trait]] of being steadfast. [[Antonyms]] include [[Wiktionary: hasty|hastiness]] and [[wiktionary: impetuous|impetuousness]].

== Scientific perspectives ==
{{See also|Delayed gratification|Reward dependence|Reward system}}

In [[psychology]] and in [[cognitive neuroscience]], patience is studied as a [[decision-making]] problem, involving the choice of either a small reward in the short-term, versus a more valuable reward in the long-term. When given a choice, all animals, humans included, are ''inclined'' to favour short-term rewards over long-term rewards. This is despite the often greater benefits associated with long-term rewards.

In 2005 a study involving [[common marmoset]]s and [[cottontop tamarin]]s, animals of both species faced a [[self-control]] paradigm in which individuals chose between taking an immediate small reward and waiting a variable amount of time for a large reward. Under these conditions, marmosets waited significantly longer for food than tamarins. This difference cannot be explained by life history, social behaviour or brain size. It can, however, be explained by feeding ecology: marmosets rely on [[Gum (botany)|gum]], a food product acquired by waiting for exudate to flow from trees, whereas tamarins feed on [[insect]]s, a food product requiring impulsive action. [[Foraging]] ecology, therefore, may provide a selective pressure for the evolution of self-control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The ecology and evolution of patience in two New World monkeys |journal= Biology Letters|volume= 1|issue= 2|pages= 223–226|date= |pmc=1626214|year= 2005|author1= Stevens|first1= J.

Patience of human users in the online world has been the subject of much recent scientific research. In a 2012 study&lt;ref name="people.cs.umass.edu"/&gt; involving tens of millions of users who watched videos on the Internet, Krishnan and [[Ramesh Sitaraman|Sitaraman]]  show that online users lose patience in as little as two seconds while waiting for their chosen video to start playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/12/tech/web/video-loading-study/| title =CNN: Online viewers ditch slow-loading video after 2 seconds, November 2012 |accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also shows that users who are connected to the Internet at faster speeds are less patient than their counterparts connected at slower speeds, demonstrating a link between the human expectation of speed and human patience. These and other scientific studies of patience have led many social commentators to conclude that the rapid pace of technology is rewiring humans to be less and less patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2013/01/10/168974423/in-video-streaming-rat-race-fast-is-never-fast-enough/| title =NPR Morning Edition: In Video-Streaming Rat Race, Fast is Never Fast Enough, October 2012 |accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bostonglobe"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/style/2013/02/01/the-growing-culture-impatience-where-instant-gratification-makes-crave-more-instant-gratification/q8tWDNGeJB2mm45fQxtTQP/story.html?s_campaign=8315| title =Boston Globe: Instant gratification is making us perpetually impatient, Feb 2013 |accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.roughtype.com/?p=2069 | title= Patience is a Network Effect, by Nicholas Carr, Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Three virtues Patientia.jpg|thumb|Three virtues by Jan Saenredam after Hendrik Goltzius. This is plate 2, titled Patientia.]]

=== Judaism ===
Patience and fortitude are prominent themes in [[Judaism]]. The [[Talmud]] extols patience as an important personal trait. The story of Micah, for example, is that he suffers many challenging conditions and yet endures, saying "I will wait for the God who saves me." Patience in God, it is said, will aid believers in finding the strength to be delivered from the evils that are inherent in the physical life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Firestone |first=Reuven |title=Patience |url=http://www.huc.edu/chronicle/60/patience.shtml |accessdate=2008-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117061152/http://www.huc.edu/chronicle/60/patience.shtml |archivedate=January 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Sefer Torah|Hebrew Torah]], patience is referred to in several proverbs, such as "The patient man shows much good sense, but the quick-tempered man displays folly at its height" ([[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 14:29, NAB); "An ill-tempered man stirs up strife, but a patient man allays discord." (Proverbs 15:18, NAB); and "A patient man is better than a warrior, and he who rules his temper, than he who takes a city." (Proverbs 16:32). The emotion is also discussed in other sections, such as Ecclesiastes: "Better is the patient spirit than the lofty spirit. Do not in spirit become quickly discontented, for discontent lodges in the bosom of a fool." ([[Ecclesiastes]] 7:8-9, NAB).

=== Christianity ===
In the [[Christianity|Christian religion]], patience is one of the most valuable [[virtue|virtues]] of [[Life expectancy|life]]. Increasing patience is viewed as the work of the [[Holy Ghost]] in the Christian who has accepted the gift of [[salvation]]. While patience is not one of the traditional biblical three [[theological virtues]] nor one of the traditional [[cardinal virtues]], it is part of the [[fruit of the Holy Spirit]], according to the [[Apostle Paul]] in his [[Epistle to the Galatians]].&lt;ref&gt;See David Baily Harned, ''Patience: How We Wait Upon the World'', rev. ed. (Eugene, OR: Wipf &amp; Stock, 2015), chap. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Christian Bible]], patience is referred to in several sections. The [[Book of Proverbs]] notes that "through patience a ruler can be persuaded, and a gentle tongue can break a bone" (Proverbs 25:14-16, NIV); [[Ecclesiastes]] points out that the "end of a matter is better than its beginning, and patience is better than pride" (Ecclesiastes 7:7-9, NIV); and [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians|1 Thessalonians]] states that we should "be patient with all. See that no one returns evil for evil; rather, always seek what is good for each other and for all" (1 Thessalonians 5:14-15, NAB). In the [[Epistle of James]], the Bible urges Christians to be patient, and " see how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth,...until it receives the early and the late rains." (James 5:7-11, NAB). In [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]], patience is listed as part of the "fruit of the Spirit": "love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law". (Galatians 5:21-23, NIV). In Timothy, the Bible states that "Jesus might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on him and receive eternal life".([[1 Timothy]] 1:15-17, [[NIV]]).&lt;ref&gt;Harned, David Baily (2015). Patience: How We Wait Upon the World. Afterword: "Leadership and Unnatural Virtues: George Washington and the Patience of Power." Eugene, OR: Wipf &amp; Stock.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===
{{Main|Sabr (Islamic term)|l1=Sabr}}

Patience with steadfast belief in [[Allah]] is called ''sabr'' ({{lang-ar|صْبِرْ ṣabr}}), one of the best virtues of life in Islam. Through [[Sabr (Islamic term)|sabr]], a Muslim believes that an individual can grow closer to God and thus attain true peace. It is also stressed in Islam, that Allah is with those who are patient, more specifically during calamity and suffering. Several verses in Quran urge Muslims to seek Allah's help when faced with fear and loss, with patient prayers and perseverance for Allah. For example:&lt;ref&gt;see also: {{Cite quran|3|195|end=200}}, {{Cite quran|41|24|end=35}}, and {{Cite quran|11|114|end=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Be sure we shall test you with something of fear and hunger, some loss in goods or lives or the fruits (of your toil), but give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere; who say, when afflicted with calamity: "To Allah We belong, and to Him is our return".|Quran|{{Cite quran|2|155|end=156|expand=no}}}}

Similarly, patience is mentioned in hadith [[Sahih Bukhari]]:

{{quote|Narrated Aisha: I asked Allah’s rasool about the plague. He said, “That was a means of torture which Allah used to send upon whomsoever He wished, but He made it a source of mercy for the believers, for anyone who is residing in a town in which this disease is present, and remains there and does not leave that town, but '''has patience and hopes for Allah’s reward''', and knows that nothing will befall him except what Allah has written for him, then he will get such reward as that of a martyr.”|{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|8|77|616}}|}}

In Islamic tradition,(''Ayyoob'') illustrates a story where he demonstrated patience and steadfast belief in [[Allah]]. [[Ibn Kathir]] narrates the story in the following manner: Job was a very rich person with much land, and many animals and children — all of which were lost and soon he was struck with disease as a test from Allah. He remained steadfast and patient in his prayers to Allah, so Allah eventually relieved him of the disease, gave him double the money he lost, and raised to life twice the number of children who had died before him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ibn Kathir |authorlink= |title=Stories of the Prophet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_053Peu7XSgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:9776005179#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= |year= 2001|publisher=Dar Al-Manarah | isbn=977-6005-17-9 |pages=157–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Buddhism ===
{{Main|Kshanti}}

In [[Buddhism]], patience ([[Sanskrit|Skt.]]: ''kshanti''; [[Pali]]: ''khanti'') is one of the "perfections" (''[[paramita]]s'') that a [[bodhisattva]] trains in and practices to realize perfect enlightenment (''[[bodhi]]''). The Buddhist concept of patience is distinct from the English definition of the word. In Buddhism, patience refers to not returning harm, rather than merely enduring a difficult situation. It is the ability to control one's emotions even when being criticized or attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/abhidharma-tenet-systems/comparison-of-buddhist-traditions/the-ten-perfections-in-theravada-mahayana-and-bon |title=Alexander Berzin, The Ten Perfections in Theravada, Mahayana and Bon, 1995 |publisher=StudyBuddhism.com |date=2012-06-08 |accessdate=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In verse 184 of the [[Dhammapada]] it is said that 'enduring patience is the highest austerity'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buddharakkhita|first1=Acharya|title=Dhammapada, 184|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/dhp.14.budd.html#dhp-184|website=Access to Insight|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society|accessdate=2014-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hinduism ===
Patience and forbearance is considered an essential virtue in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/665848/sanatana-dharma See virtues discussed under article on Sanatana Dharma] Encyclopædia Britannica (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madigan, T. (2009), Schopenhauer’s compassionate morality, Philosophy Now, 52, 16-17&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient literature of Hinduism, the concept of patience is referred to with the word ''pariksaha'' (patience and forbearance, Sanskrit: परिषहा),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=pariSahA&amp;link=m see PariSahA], Sanskrit Dictionary, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/mwquery/ Search for sanskrit word pariSahA] Monier Williams Translation of Sanskrit Concepts, University of Koln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; and several other words such as sahiṣṇutā (patient toleration, Sanskrit: सहिष्णुता),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=patience&amp;link=m Sanskrit words related to "Patience" in Sanskrit Dictionary, Germany] See also Monier Williams Translation of Sanskrit Concepts&lt;/ref&gt; ''titiksha'' (forbearance, Sanskrit: तितिक्षा),&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, A.

Patience, in Hindu philosophy, is the cheerful endurance of trying conditions and the consequence of one's action and deeds ([[karma]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/gsoy/gsoy06.htm Shankaracharya's Vedānta] Ernest Wood, {{ISBN|978-1425482596}}, see Chapter 4, under GNYANA-YOGA, pp 73-74&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the capacity to wait, endure opposites - such as pain and pleasure, cold and heat, sorrows and joys - calmly, without anxiety, and without a desire to seek revenge.&lt;ref&gt;R.S. Nathan (2000), Hinduism that is Sanatana Dharma, {{ISBN|81-7597-065-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tattvabhushan, S. (1898), Sankvracharya (His life and teaching: a translation of Atma-Bodha), 2nd Edition, The Society for the Resuscitation of Indian Literature&lt;/ref&gt; In interpersonal relationships, virtuous ''titiksha'' means that if someone attacks or insults without cause, one must endure it without feeling enmity, anger, resentment or anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, A. and Rigby, A. (2009), [http://curve.coventry.ac.uk/open/file/a9392056-ec87-76d1-89ac-b9b379a28501/1/huntergandhi.pdf Gandhi and the virtue of forgiveness], Gandhi Marg 30 (4), see page 430&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of patience is explained as being more than trust, and as a value that reflects the state of one's body and mind.&lt;ref name=kaneda2008/&gt; The term ''pariksaha'' is sometimes also translated as test or exam, in other contexts. Some of these concepts have been carried into the spiritual understanding of yoga. Sandilya [[Upanishad]] of Hinduism identifies ten sources of patience and forbearances: Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Brahmacharya, Daya, Arjava, Kshama, Dhriti, Mitahara and Saucha.

The classical literature of Hinduism exists in many Indian languages. For example, ''[[Tirukkuṛaḷ]]'' written between 200 BC and 400 AD, and sometimes called the Tamil [[Veda]], is one of the most cherished classics on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. It too discusses patience and forbearance, dedicating Chapter 16 of Book 1 to it. ''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' suggests ''patience'' is necessary for an ethical life and one's long term happiness, even if patience is sometimes difficult in the short term. Some of the verse excerpts from this book are: "our conduct must always foster forbearance"; "one must patiently endure rude remarks, because it delivers us to purity"; "if we are unjustly wronged by others, it is best to conquer our hurt with patience, accept suffering, and refrain from unrighteous retaliation"; "it is good to patiently endure injuries done to you, but to forget them is even better"; "just as the Earth bears those who dig into her, one must with patience bear with those who despise us", and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf Tirukkuṛaḷ] Translated by Rev G.U.

=== Meher Baba ===
The spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] stated that "[O]ne of the first requirements of the [spiritual] aspirant is that he should combine ''unfailing enthusiasm with unyielding patience''....Spiritual effort demands not only physical endurance and courage, but also unshrinking forbearance and unassailable moral courage."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). ''Discourses''. '''3'''. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. p. 118-119. {{ISBN|978-1880619094}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical perspectives ==
In ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'', philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] argued that "being able to wait is so hard that the greatest poets did not disdain to make the inability to wait the theme of their poetry." He notes that "Passion will not wait", and gives the example of cases of duels, in which the "advising friends have to determine whether the parties involved might be able to wait a while longer. If they cannot, then a duel is reasonable [because]...to wait would be to continue suffering the horrible torture of offended honor...".

== Impatience ==
{{Multiple Issues|section=yes|
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
{{Original research|section|date=December 2015}}
}}

Impatience is not just the opposite of patience or the lack of it, it is more than that. Impatience is also a cultural phenomenon in many respects. There are deep-rooted psychological and social reasons for both feelings of and displays of impatience.

=== Examples of Impatience ===
The term '[[road rage]]' is commonly used to refer to situations that are the result of some form of impatience, though of course there can be other factors involved. This phrase refers to circumstances where one or both drivers get into a confrontation in which they are emotionally involved. Driving anywhere in the world can be frustrating. However, attitudes towards annoying circumstances vary widely from one place to another. Excessive honking, as a further example of impatience, is very common in some countries, but not so much in others.

Behavior in '''restaurants and other public places''' is another example. People can often be rude and impatient toward other patrons, as well as to the staff serving customers. Although a customer may have legitimate complaints about something, there is really no justification to be difficult about it. On the other hand, there is no reason for staff to be surly or curt with customers, but it does happen, all too often.&lt;ref&gt;sounds bias&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Telephone service and support''' is another situation where customers can become impatient with company representatives. This may partly be the result of changes in how these support services work. In an effort to save expense costs, many organizations have automated part of all of these services. This starts off the process, in the customer's view, on a somewhat unpleasant note. By the time the client has maneuvered their way through the system, including being on hold for a significant length of time, and sometimes eventually reaching the wrong person for whatever reason, the customer is understandably upset.

=== Positive Aspects of Impatience ===
Impatience is usually viewed as a negative thing. Patience should not be confused with laziness, complacency or inaptitude. Laziness is lacking a desire to fix a certain problem or complete a job. Laziness means that one's desire to do other things than a given task outweighs the desire to do that particular task. This is not the same as being patient with a process.

The Perl programming culture has famously declared Impatience to be a virtue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://threevirtues.com/ ''The Three Virtues'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4189">{{hatnote|Pinching is a [[Multi-touch#Multi-touch gestures|multi-touch]] gesture, done by squeezing one's fingers on a [[touchscreen]].}}

A '''pinch''' is a grip of a flexible object in which a portion is taken between two [[finger]]s, until it hurts, or something of resemblance and squeezed so the gripped portion of the object is lifted from its normal level. By extension, that which is taken in the grip is referred to as a "pinch."

When the fingers are used to perform a pinch, the action usually consists of the [[thumb]] and one other finger. The closer to the thumb the other finger is located, the stronger the pinch.

==Pinch of the skin==
The term "pinch" often refers to the action being taken on the [[skin]]. A pinch of the skin displaces the skin and [[blood]] beneath from its natural position, and may inflict a minor degree of pain, which may increase if the amount of skin being pinched is smaller, but is usually tolerable to most.

Pinching the skin can result in [[pinch mark]]s, a [[List of cutaneous conditions|cutaneous condition]], and when on the ears or in the genital region of male children may be suggestive of child abuse.&lt;ref name="Bolognia"&gt;{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P. |author2=Bolognia, Jean L. |author3=Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical uses===
[[File:Penile nerve block dorsal.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The skin is being pinched while an injection is being given]]
Pinching has the following uses in health care and medicine:
*The skin is often pinched prior to giving an [[injection (medicine)|injection]] in order to get the needle in the desired location.
*In [[neurology]], pinching can be used to determine pain sensitivity for a certain area of skin. 
*Can be used to determine [[Resilience (materials science)|resiliency]] in the skin of an [[old age|aged person]]. When the skin is pinched, the amount of time the pinch remains visible following the pinch is an indicator.&lt;ref&gt;Physical dimensions of aging By Waneen Wyrick Spirduso, Karen L. Francis, Priscilla G. MacRae: Page 83&lt;/ref&gt; 
*When skin has been [[sunburn|damaged by the sun]], pinching can be used to determine the amount of damage. Examining the appearance with varying amounts of time following the pinch can be used to determine the amount of damage.&lt;ref&gt;Photodamaged skin: clinical signs, causes and management By Jean-Paul Ortonne, Ronald Marks: Page 19&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In determining [[dehydration]], pinching the skin can serve as a test. The speed at which the pinch turns back can help determine the level of dehydration. The slower it goes back, the more severe the dehydration.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook IMCI: integrated management of childhood illness By World Health Organization. Dept. of Child and Adolescent Health and Development: Page 27&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Body fat percentage]] can be determined the [[skinfold test]], in which a pinch of skin is precisely measured by calipers at several standardized points on the body to determine the subcutaneous fat layer thickness. These measurements are converted to an estimated body fat percentage by an equation.
*Pinching is used as part of the diagnosis of [[schleroderma]]. In schleroderma patients, the skin between the fingers becomes too difficult to pinch.&lt;ref&gt;Atlas of the musculoskeletal examination By Gerald F. Moore, Gerald Moore: Page 46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pinch of powder==
A pinch can refer to the taking of a small amount of a [[powder (substance)|powdery substance]].

In cooking, a "[[Pinch (cooking)|pinch]]" refers to a small amount of an ingredient, such as [[table salt|salt]] or a [[spice]], being taken to be placed within a recipe.

Small amounts of [[street drug]]s are sometimes referred to as a "pinch."

'''Pāguññatā''' (Pali) is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as  "proficiency", and it is the basis for the following pair of [[Mental_factors_(Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings:
* ''Kāya-pāguññatā'' - proficiency of mental body (or proficiency of cetisakas)
* ''Citta-pāguññatā'' - proficiency of consciousness (or proficiency of citta)

These two mental factors have the characteristic of healthiness of the mental body and consciousness, respectively.

==Definition==
Bhikkhu Bodhi states:{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2374-2377}}
:The twofold proficiency has the characteristic of healthiness of the mental body and consciousness, respectively. Its function is to crush unhealthiness of the mental body and consciousness. It is manifested as absence of disability. Its proximate cause is the mental body and consciousness. It should be regarded as opposed to lack of faith, etc., which cause unhealthiness of the mental body and consciousness.

Nina van Gorkom explains:{{sfn|van Gorkom|2010|p=229}}
:According to the ''Dhammasangani'' (par 48, 49) this pair of cetasikas consists in fitness, competence and efficiency. ''Pāguññatā'' is fitness, competence or efficiency in the performance of kusala.
:The ''[[Atthasālinī]]'' (I, Book I, Part IV, Chapter I, 131) explains that proficiency of cetasikas and of citta suppress mental illness and that they are the opponents of the corruptions, such as diffidence, which cause mental illness.
:When the citta is akusala citta, there is diffidence, lack of confidence in kusala and then there is mental sickness. Mental proficiency assists the kusala citta and then citta and cetasikas are healthy and skilful so that they can perform their functions in the most efficient way.

{{Distinguish|Realty}}
{{pp-semi-vandalism|small=yes}}

'''Reality''' is the sum or aggregate of all that is real or [[Existence|existent]], as opposed to that which is merely [[Object of the mind|imaginary]]. The term is also used to refer to the ontological status of things, indicating their existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/reality|title=reality {{!}} Definition of reality in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[physics|physical]] terms, reality is the totality of the [[universe]], known and unknown. Philosophical questions about the nature of reality or existence or being are considered under the rubric of [[ontology]], which is a major branch of [[metaphysics]] in the Western philosophical tradition. Ontological questions also feature in diverse branches of philosophy, including the [[philosophy of science]], [[philosophy of religion]], [[philosophy of mathematics]], and [[philosophical logic]]. These include questions about whether only physical objects are real (i.e., [[Physicalism]]), whether reality is fundamentally immaterial (e.g., [[Idealism]]), whether hypothetical unobservable entities posited by scientific theories exist, whether [[God]] exists, whether numbers and other [[abstract objects]] exist, and whether [[Possible world|possible worlds]] exist.

=== World views and theories ===

{{Further|World view}}

A common colloquial usage would have ''reality'' mean "perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes toward reality", as in "My reality is not your reality." This is often used just as a [[colloquialism]] indicating that the parties to a conversation agree, or should agree, not to quibble over deeply different conceptions of what is real. For example, in a religious discussion between friends, one might say (attempting humor), "You might disagree, but in my reality, everyone goes to heaven."

Reality can be defined in a way that links it to worldviews or parts of them (conceptual frameworks): Reality is the totality of all things, structures (actual and conceptual), events (past and present) and phenomena, whether observable or not. It is what a world view (whether it be based on individual or shared human experience) ultimately attempts to describe or map.

Certain ideas from physics, philosophy, sociology, [[literary criticism]], and other fields shape various theories of reality. One such belief is that there simply and literally ''is'' no reality beyond the perceptions or beliefs we each have about reality. Such attitudes are summarized in the popular statement, "Perception is reality" or "Life is how you perceive reality" or "reality is what you can get away with" ([[Robert Anton Wilson]]), and they indicate [[anti-realism]]&amp;nbsp;– that is, the view that there is no objective reality, whether acknowledged explicitly or not.

Many of the concepts of science and philosophy are often defined [[culture|culturally]] and [[sociology|socially]]. This idea was elaborated by [[Thomas Kuhn]] in his book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962). ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]'', a book about the [[sociology of knowledge]] written by [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]], was published in 1966. It explained how knowledge is acquired and used for the comprehension of reality. Out of all the realities, the reality of everyday life is the most important one since our consciousness requires us to be completely aware and attentive to the experience of everyday life.

== Western philosophy ==
[[Philosophy]] addresses two different aspects of the topic of reality: the nature of reality itself, and the relationship between the [[mind]] (as well as [[language]] and [[culture]]) and reality.

On the one hand, [[ontology]] is the study of being, and the central topic of the field is couched, variously, in terms of being, existence, "what is", and reality. The task in ontology is to describe the most general [[category of being|categories of reality]] and how they are interrelated. If a philosopher wanted to proffer a positive definition of the concept "reality", it would be done under this heading. As explained above, some philosophers draw a distinction between reality and existence. In fact, many analytic philosophers today tend to avoid the term "real" and "reality" in discussing ontological issues. But for those who would treat "is real" the same way they treat "exists", one of the leading questions of analytic philosophy has been whether existence (or reality) is a property of objects. It has been widely held by analytic philosophers that it is ''not'' a property at all, though this view has lost some ground in recent decades.

On the other hand, particularly in discussions of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] that have feet in both [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]], philosophical discussions of "reality" often concern the ways in which reality is, or is not, in some way ''dependent upon'' (or, to use fashionable [[jargon]], "constructed" out of) mental and cultural factors such as perceptions, beliefs, and other mental states, as well as cultural artifacts, such as [[religion]]s and [[political movement]]s, on up to the vague notion of a common cultural [[world view]], or '''{{lang|de|[[Weltanschauung]]}}'''.

The view that there is a reality independent of any beliefs, perceptions, etc., is called [[Philosophical realism|realism]]. More specifically, philosophers are given to speaking about "realism ''about''" this and that, such as realism about universals or realism about the external world. Generally, where one can identify any class of object, the existence or essential characteristics of which is said not to depend on perceptions, beliefs, language, or any other human artifact, one can speak of "realism ''about''" that object.

One can also speak of ''anti''-realism about the same objects. ''[[Anti-realism]]'' is the latest in a long series of terms for views opposed to realism. Perhaps the first was [[idealism (philosophy)|idealism]], so called because reality was said to be in the mind, or a product of our ''ideas''. [[Berkeleyan idealism]] is the view, propounded by the Irish [[empiricism|empiricist]] [[George Berkeley]], that the objects of perception are actually ideas in the mind. In this view, one might be tempted to say that reality is a "mental construct"; this is not quite accurate, however, since, in Berkeley's view, perceptual ideas are created and coordinated by God. By the 20th century, views similar to Berkeley's were called [[phenomenalism]]. Phenomenalism differs from Berkeleyan idealism primarily in that Berkeley believed that minds, or souls, are not merely ideas nor made up of ideas, whereas varieties of phenomenalism, such as that advocated by [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], tended to go farther to say that the mind itself is merely a collection of perceptions, memories, etc., and that there is no mind or soul over and above such [[mental event]]s. Finally, anti-realism became a fashionable term for ''any'' view which held that the existence of some object depends upon the mind or cultural artifacts. The view that the so-called external world is really merely a social, or cultural, artifact, called [[social constructionism]], is one variety of anti-realism. [[Cultural relativism]] is the view that [[social issues]] such as morality are not absolute, but at least partially [[cultural artifact]].

A [[correspondence theory]] of [[knowledge]] about what exists claims that "true" knowledge of reality represents accurate correspondence of statements about and images of reality with the actual reality that the statements or images are attempting to represent. For example, the [[scientific method]] can [[Empiricism|verify]] that a statement is true based on the observable evidence that a thing exists. Many humans can point to the [[Rocky Mountains]] and say that this [[mountain range]] exists, and continues to exist even if no one is observing it or making statements about it.

=== Being ===
The nature of [[being]] is a perennial topic in metaphysics. For, instance [[Parmenides]] taught that reality was a single unchanging Being, whereas [[Heraclitus]] wrote that all things flow. The 20th century philosopher [[Heidegger]] thought previous philosophers have lost sight the question of Being (qua Being) in favour of the questions of beings (existing things), so that a return to the Parmenidean approach was needed. An [[ontological catalogue]] is an attempt to list the fundamental constituents of reality. The question of whether or not [[existence]] is a [[wikt:predicate|predicate]] has been discussed since the Early Modern period, not least in relation to the [[ontological argument for the existence of God]]. Existence, ''that'' something is, has been contrasted with ''[[essence]]'', the question of ''what'' something is.
Since existence without essence seems blank, it associated with [[nothingness]] by philosophers such as Hegel. [[Nihilism]] represents an extremely negative view of being, the [[absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] a positive one.

=== Perception ===
The question of [[direct realism|direct or "naïve" realism]], as opposed to [[indirect realism|indirect or "representational" realism]], arises in the [[philosophy of perception]] and [[philosophy of mind|of mind]] out of the debate over the nature of [[Consciousness|conscious]] [[Qualia|experience]];&lt;ref name=lehar&gt;Lehar, Steve. (2000). [http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/consc1/consc1.html The Function of Conscious Experience: An Analogical Paradigm of Perception and Behavior], ''Consciousness and Cognition''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ce&gt;Lehar, Steve. (2000). [http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/epist/naive-philos.html Naïve Realism in Contemporary Philosophy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811172229/http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/epist/naive-philos.html |date=2012-08-11 }}, ''The Function of Conscious Experience''.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] question of whether the world we see around us is the real world itself or merely an internal perceptual copy of that world generated by [[neural]] processes in our [[Human brain|brain]]. [[Naïve realism]] is known as ''direct'' realism when developed to counter ''indirect'' or representative realism, also known as [[epistemological dualism]],&lt;ref&gt;Lehar, Steve. [http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/Representationalism.html Representationalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905185905/http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/Representationalism.html |date=2012-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] position that our conscious experience is not of the real world itself but of an internal representation, a miniature [[Virtual reality|virtual-reality]] replica of the world.

[[Timothy Leary]] coined the influential term [[Reality tunnel|Reality Tunnel]], by which he means a kind of [[representative realism]]. The theory states that, with a subconscious set of mental filters formed from their beliefs and experiences, every individual interprets the same world differently, hence "Truth is in the eye of the beholder". His ideas influenced the work of his friend [[Robert Anton Wilson]].

=== Abstract objects and mathematics ===
The status of [[Abstraction (mathematics)|abstract]] entities, particularly numbers, is a topic of discussion in mathematics.

In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], the best known form of realism about numbers is [[Platonic realism]], which grants them abstract, immaterial existence. Other forms of realism identify mathematics with the concrete physical universe.

Anti-realist stances include [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]] and [[mathematical fictionalism|fictionalism]].

Some approaches are selectively realistic about some mathematical objects but not others. [[Finitism]] rejects [[Infinity|infinite]] quantities. [[Ultra-finitism]] accepts finite quantities up to a certain amount. [[Constructivism (mathematics)|Constructivism]] and [[intuitionism]] are realistic about objects that can be explicitly constructed, but reject the use of the [[principle of the excluded middle]] to prove existence by [[reductio ad absurdum]].

The traditional debate has focused on whether an abstract (immaterial, intelligible) realm of numbers has existed ''in addition to'' the physical (sensible, concrete) world. A recent development is the [[mathematical universe hypothesis]], the theory that ''only'' a mathematical world exists, with the finite, physical world being an illusion within it.

An extreme form of realism about mathematics is the [[mathematical multiverse hypothesis]] advanced by [[Max Tegmark]]. Tegmark's sole postulate is: ''All structures that exist mathematically also exist physically''. That is, in the sense that "in those [worlds] complex enough to contain self-aware substructures [they] will subjectively perceive themselves as existing in a physically 'real' world".&lt;ref name="Tegmark2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tegmark |first=Max |date=February 2008 |title=The Mathematical Universe |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=101–150 |doi=10.1007/s10701-007-9186-9 |arxiv=0704.0646|bibcode = 2008FoPh...38..101T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tegmark (1998), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis suggests that worlds corresponding to different sets of initial conditions, physical constants, or altogether different equations should be considered real. The theory can be considered a form of [[Platonism]] in that it posits the existence of mathematical entities, but can also be considered a [[philosophy of mathematics|mathematical monism]] in that it denies that anything exists except mathematical objects.

=== Properties ===
{{Main|Problem of universals}}

The problem of universals is an ancient problem in [[metaphysics]] about whether [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] exist. Universals are general or abstract qualities, characteristics, [[property (philosophy)|properties]], kinds or [[relation (philosophy)|relations]], such as being male/female, solid/liquid/gas or a certain colour,&lt;ref&gt;Loux (2001), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; that can be predicated of individuals or particulars or that individuals or particulars can be regarded as sharing or participating in. For example, Scott, Pat, and Chris have in common the universal quality of ''being human'' or ''humanity''.

The realist school claims that universals are real&amp;nbsp;– they exist and are distinct from the particulars that instantiate them. There are various forms of realism. Two major forms are [[Platonic realism]] and [[Aristotelian realism]].&lt;ref&gt;Price (1953), among others, sometimes uses such Latin terms&lt;/ref&gt; ''Platonic realism'' is the view that universals are real entities and they exist independent of particulars. ''Aristotelian realism'', on the other hand, is the view that universals are real entities, but their existence is dependent on the particulars that exemplify them.

[[Nominalism]] and [[conceptualism]] are the main forms of anti-realism about universals.

=== Time and space ===
{{Main|Philosophy of space and time}}

A traditional [[Philosophical realism|realist]] position in [[ontology]] is that time and space have existence apart from the human mind. [[Idealism|Idealists]] deny or doubt the existence of objects independent of the mind. Some [[anti-realism|anti-realists]] whose ontological position is that objects outside the mind do exist, nevertheless doubt the independent existence of time and space.

[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', described time as an ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' notion that, together with other ''a priori'' notions such as [[space]], allows us to comprehend [[empirical evidence|sense experience]]. Kant denies that either space or time are [[Substance theory|substance]], entities in themselves, or learned by experience; he holds rather that both are elements of a systematic framework we use to structure our experience. Spatial [[measurement]]s are used to [[quantity|quantify]] how far apart [[Physical body|objects]] are, and temporal measurements are used to quantitatively compare the interval between (or duration of) [[Spacetime#Basic concepts|events]]. Although
space and time are held to be ''transcendentally ideal'' in this sense, they are also ''empirically real'', i.e. not mere illusions.

Idealist writers such as [[J. M. E. McTaggart]] in ''[[The Unreality of Time]]'' have argued that time is an illusion.

As well as differing about the reality of time as a whole, metaphysical theories of [[time]] can differ in their ascriptions of reality to the [[past]], [[present]] and [[future]] separately.
* [[Presentism (philosophy of time)|Presentism]] holds that the past and future are unreal, and only an ever-changing present is real.
* The [[block universe]] theory, also known as Eternalism, holds that past, present and future are all real, but the passage of time is an illusion. It is often said to have a scientific basis in [[Theory of relativity|relativity]].
* The [[growing block universe]] theory holds that past and present are real, but the future is not.

Time, and the related concepts of process and [[evolution]] are central to the [[system-building metaphysics]] of [[A. N. Whitehead]] and [[Charles Hartshorne]].

=== Possible worlds ===
The term "[[possible world]]" goes back to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz's]] theory of possible worlds, used to analyse necessity, [[Logical possibility|possibility]], and similar [[modal logic|modal notions]]. [[Modal realism]] is the view, notably propounded by [[David Kellogg Lewis]], that all [[possible worlds]] are as real as the actual world. In short: the actual world is regarded as merely one among an [[infinity|infinite]] [[set theory|set]] of [[logically possible]] worlds, some "nearer" to the actual world and some more remote. Other theorists may use the Possible World framework to express and explore problems without committing to it ontologically.
Possible world theory is related to [[alethic logic]]: a proposition is ''necessary'' if it is true in all possible worlds, and ''possible'' if it is true in at least one. The [[many worlds interpretation]] of quantum mechanics is a similar idea in science.

=== Theories of everything (TOE) and philosophy ===
{{Main|Theory of everything (philosophy)}}

The philosophical implications of a physical TOE are frequently debated. For example, if philosophical [[physicalism]] is true, a physical TOE will coincide with a philosophical theory of everything.

The [[System-building metaphysics|"system building"]] style of [[metaphysics]] attempts to answer ''all'' the important questions in a coherent way, providing a complete picture of the world. [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] could be said to be early examples of comprehensive systems. In the early modern period (17th and 18th centuries), the system-building ''scope'' of philosophy is often linked to the rationalist ''method'' of philosophy, that is the technique of deducing the nature of the world by pure ''a priori'' reason. Examples from the early modern period include the [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s [[Monadology]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]]'s [[Mind-body dualism|Dualism]], [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]'s [[Monism]]. [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s [[Absolute idealism]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s [[Process philosophy]] were later systems.

Other philosophers do not believe its techniques can aim so high. Some scientists think a more mathematical approach than philosophy is needed for a TOE, for instance [[Stephen Hawking]] wrote in ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'' that even if we had a TOE, it would necessarily be a set of equations. He wrote, "What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe?"&lt;ref&gt;as quoted in [Artigas, ''The Mind of the Universe'', p.123]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phenomenological reality ===
On a much broader and more subjective level,{{Specify|date=August 2011}} private experiences, curiosity, inquiry, and the selectivity involved in personal interpretation of events shapes reality as seen by one and only one individual{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and hence is called [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]]. While this
form of reality might be common to others as well, it could at times also be so unique to oneself as to never be experienced or agreed upon by anyone else. Much of the kind of experience deemed [[Spirituality|spiritual]] occurs on this level of reality.

Phenomenology is a [[philosophical method]] developed in the early years of the twentieth century by [[Edmund Husserl]] and a circle of followers at the universities of [[Göttingen]] and [[Munich]] in [[Germany]]. Subsequently, phenomenological themes were taken up by philosophers in France, the United States, and elsewhere, often in contexts far removed from Husserl's work.

The word ''phenomenology'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''phainómenon'', meaning "that which appears", and ''lógos'', meaning "study". In Husserl's conception, phenomenology is primarily concerned with making the structures of [[consciousness]], and the [[phenomena]] which appear in acts of consciousness, objects of systematic reflection and analysis. Such reflection was to take place from a highly modified "[[First-person narrative|first person]]" viewpoint, studying phenomena not as they appear to "my" consciousness, but to any consciousness whatsoever. Husserl believed that phenomenology could thus provide a firm basis for all human [[knowledge]], including scientific knowledge, and could establish philosophy as a "rigorous science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Joseph Kockelmans | year = 2001 | title = Edmund Husserl's phenomenology | edition = 2 | publisher = [[Purdue University]] Press | pages = 311–314 | isbn = 1-55753-050-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Husserl's conception of phenomenology has been criticised and developed not only by himself, but also by his student and assistant [[Martin Heidegger]], by [[existentialists]], such as [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], and by other philosophers, such as [[Paul Ricoeur]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], and [[Dietrich von Hildebrand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Steven Galt Crowell | year = 2001 | title = Husserl, Heidegger, and the space of meaning: paths toward transcendental phenomenology | publisher = [[Northwestern University]] Press | page = 160 | isbn = 0-8101-1805-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skeptical hypotheses ===
[[File:braininvat.jpg|thumb|right|280px|A [[brain in a vat]] that believes it is walking]]
Skeptical hypotheses in philosophy suggest that reality is very different from what we think it is; or at least that we cannot prove it is not. Examples include:

* The "[[Brain in a vat]]" hypothesis is cast in scientific terms. It supposes that one might be a disembodied brain kept alive in a vat, and fed false sensory signals, by a [[mad scientist]]. This is a premise of the film series, [[Matrix hypothesis]].
* The "[[Dream argument]]" of Descartes and [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]] supposes reality to be indistinguishable from a dream.
* Descarte's [[Evil demon]] is a being "as clever and deceitful as he is powerful, who has directed his entire effort to misleading me."
* The [[five minute hypothesis]] (or [[omphalos hypothesis]] or [[Last Thursdayism]]) suggests that the world was created recently together with records and traces indicating a greater age.
* The Matrix hypothesis or [[Simulated reality hypothesis]] suggest that we might be inside a [[computer simulation]] or [[virtual reality]].

== Jain philosophy ==
{{Main|Tattva (Jainism)}}
[[Jain philosophy]] postulates that seven '''tattva''' (truths or fundamental principles) constitute reality.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=6}} These seven ''tattva'' are:{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=7}}
#''[[Jiva|Jīva]]'' – The [[Soul (Jainism)|soul]] which is characterized by consciousness.
#''[[Ajiva|Ajīva]]'' – The non-soul.
#''[[Asrava]]'' – Influx of [[Karma in Jainism|karma]].
#''[[Bandha (Jainism)|Bandha]]'' – The bondage of karma.
#''[[Samvara]]'' – Obstruction of the inflow of karmic matter into the soul.
#''[[Nirjara]]'' – Shedding of karmas.
#''[[Moksha (Jainism)|Moksha]]'' – Liberation or Salvation, i.e. the complete annihilation of all karmic matter (bound with any particular soul).

== Physical sciences ==

=== Scientific realism ===
[[Scientific realism]] is, at the most general level, the view that the world described by science (perhaps ideal science) is the real world, as it is, independent of what we might take it to be. Within [[philosophy of science]], it is often framed as an answer to the question "how is the success of science to be explained?" The debate over what the success of science involves centers primarily on the status of entities that are [[unobservable|not directly observable]] discussed by [[scientific theory|scientific theories]]. Generally, those who are scientific realists state that one can make reliable claims about these entities (viz., that they have the same [[Ontology|ontological]] status) as directly observable entities, as opposed to [[instrumentalism]]. The most used and studied scientific theories today state more or less the truth.

=== Realism and locality in physics ===
''Realism'' in the sense used by physicists does not equate to [[Philosophical realism|realism]] in [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Against `Realism'|first=Travis|last=Norsen|date=26 February 2007|publisher=|journal=Foundations of Physics|volume=37|issue=3|pages=311–340|doi=10.1007/s10701-007-9104-1|arxiv=quant-ph/0607057|bibcode=2007FoPh...37..311N}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The latter is the claim that the world is mind-independent: that even if the results of a measurement do not pre-exist the act of measurement, that does not require that they are the creation of the observer. Furthermore, a mind-independent property does not have to be the value of some physical variable such as position or [[momentum]]. A property can be ''[[disposition]]al'' (or potential), i.e. it can be a tendency: in the way that glass objects tend to break, or are disposed to break, even if they do not ''actually'' break. Likewise, the mind-independent properties of quantum systems could consist of a tendency to respond to particular measurements with particular values with ascertainable probability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.generativescience.org/|title=Generative Science|first=Ian|last=Thompson|website=www.generativescience.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an ontology would be metaphysically realistic, without being realistic in the physicist's sense of "local realism" (which would require that a single value be produced with certainty).

A closely related term is [[counterfactual definiteness]] (CFD), used to refer to the claim that one can meaningfully speak of the definiteness of results of measurements that have not been performed (i.e. the ability to assume the existence of objects, and properties of objects, even when they have not been measured).

[[Local realism]] is a significant feature of classical mechanics, of [[general relativity]], and of [[electrodynamics]]; but [[quantum mechanics]] has shown that [[quantum entanglement]] is possible. This was rejected by Einstein, who proposed the [[EPR paradox]], but it was subsequently quantified by [[Bell's inequalities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bendov.info/eng/crucial.htm|title=Local realism and the crucial experiment|website=bendov.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Bell's inequalities are violated, either local realism ''or'' [[counterfactual definiteness]] must be incorrect; but some physicists dispute that experiments have demonstrated Bell's violations, on the grounds that the sub-class of [[Bells Theorem#Two classes of Bell inequalities|inhomogeneous Bell inequalities]] has not been tested or due to [[Bell test loopholes|experimental limitations in the tests]]. Different [[interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretations of quantum mechanics]] violate different parts of local realism and/or [[counterfactual definiteness]].

=== Role of the observer in quantum mechanics ===
{{See also|Quantum decoherence}}
The quantum mind–body problem refers to the philosophical discussions of the [[mind–body problem]] in the context of [[quantum mechanics]]. Since quantum mechanics involves [[quantum superposition]]s, which [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|are not perceived by observers]], some [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]] place conscious observers in a special position.

The founders of quantum mechanics debated the role of the observer, and of them, [[Wolfgang Pauli]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] believed that it was the observer that produced [[wave function collapse|collapse]]. This point of view, which was never fully endorsed by [[Niels Bohr]], was denounced as mystical and anti-scientific by [[Albert Einstein]]. Pauli accepted the term, and described quantum mechanics as ''lucid mysticism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Juan Miguel Marin|year=2009|title='Mysticism' in quantum mechanics: the forgotten controversy|journal=European Journal of Physics|volume=30|issue=4|pages=807–822|bibcode=2009EJPh...30..807M|doi=10.1088/0143-0807/30/4/014}} [http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0143-0807/30/4/014/ejp9_4_014.pdf?request-id=9350419a-e5ea-42e2-b5f3-7878a09dfe42 link], summarized here [http://www.physorg.com/news163670588.html%7care/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606092933/http://www.physorg.com/news163670588.html%7Care/|date=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heisenberg and Bohr always described quantum mechanics in [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] terms. Bohr also took an active interest in the philosophical implications of quantum theories such as his [[Complementarity (physics)|complementarity]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Zygon: Journal of Religion &amp; Science |author=John Honner |title= Niels Bohr and the Mysticism of Nature |volume=17-3 |pages=243–253 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed quantum theory offers a complete description of nature, albeit one that is simply ill-suited for everyday experiences&amp;nbsp;– which are better described by classical mechanics and probability. Bohr never specified a demarcation line above which objects cease to be quantum and become classical. He believed that it was not a question of physics, but one of philosophy.

[[Eugene Wigner]] reformulated the "[[Schrödinger's cat]]" [[thought experiment]] as "[[Wigner's friend]]" and proposed that the consciousness of an observer is the demarcation line which precipitates [[Wave function collapse|collapse of the wave function]], independent of any realist interpretation. Commonly known as "[[consciousness causes collapse]]", this [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretation]] of quantum mechanics states that [[observation]] by a [[conscious]] observer is what makes the wave function collapse.

=== Multiverse ===
The [[multiverse]] is the [[hypothetical]] set of multiple possible [[universe]]s (including the historical universe we consistently experience) that together comprise everything that [[Existence|exists]]: the entirety of [[space]], [[time]], [[matter]], and [[energy]] as well as the [[physical law]]s and [[physical constant|constants]] that describe them. The term was coined in 1895 by the American philosopher and psychologist [[William James]].&lt;ref&gt;James, William, ''The Will to Believe'', 1895; and earlier in 1895, as cited in [[OED]]'s new 2003 entry for "multiverse": "1895 W. JAMES in Internat. Jrnl. Ethics 6 10 Visible nature is all plasticity and indifference, a multiverse, as one might call it, and not a universe."&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[many-worlds interpretation]] (MWI), one of the mainstream [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]], there are an infinite number of universes and every possible quantum outcome occurs in at least one universe.

The structure of the multiverse, the nature of each universe within it and the relationship between the various constituent universes, depend on the specific multiverse hypothesis considered. Multiverses have been hypothesized in [[cosmology]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[religion]], [[philosophy]], [[transpersonal psychology]] and [[fiction]], particularly in [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]]. In these contexts, parallel universes are also called "alternative universes", "quantum universes", "interpenetrating dimensions", "parallel dimensions", "parallel worlds", "alternative realities", "alternative timelines", and "dimensional planes", among others.

=== Scientific theories of everything ===
A [[theory of everything]] (TOE) is a putative [[theory]] of [[theoretical physics]] that fully explains and links together all known physical phenomena, and predicts the outcome of ''any'' experiment that could be carried out ''in principle''. The theory of everything is also called the '''final theory'''.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Many candidate theories of everything have been proposed by theoretical physicists during the twentieth century, but none have been confirmed experimentally. The primary problem in producing a TOE is that [[general relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]] are hard to unify. This is one of the [[unsolved problems in physics]].

Initially, the term "theory of everything" was used with an ironic connotation to refer to various overgeneralized theories. For example, a great-grandfather of [[Ijon Tichy]], a character from a cycle of [[Stanisław Lem]]'s [[science fiction]] stories of the 1960s, was known to work on the "General Theory of Everything". Physicist [[John Ellis (physicist)|John Ellis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Current candidates for a theory of everything include [[string theory]], [[M theory]], and [[loop quantum gravity]].

== Technology ==

=== Virtual reality and cyberspace ===
[[Virtual reality]] (VR) is a [[Computer simulation|computer-simulated]] environment that can simulate physical presence in places in the real world, as well as in imaginary worlds.

[[File:Virtuality Continuum 2.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Reality-Virtuality Continuum.]]The [[Virtuality Continuum]] is a continuous scale ranging between the completely virtual, a [[Virtual Reality|Virtuality]], and the completely real: Reality. The reality-virtuality continuum therefore encompasses all possible variations and compositions of real and [[Virtuality|virtual]] objects. It has been described as a concept in [[new media]] and [[computer science]], but in fact it could be considered a matter of [[anthropology]]. The concept was first introduced by Paul Milgram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=Paul |last=Milgram |author2=H. Takemura |author3=A. Utsumi |author4=F. Kishino |title=Augmented Reality: A class of displays on the reality-virtuality continuum |booktitle=Proceedings of Telemanipulator and Telepresence Technologies |pages=2351–34 |year=1994 |url=http://vered.rose.utoronto.ca/publication/1994/Milgram_Takemura_SPIE1994.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004044435/https://vered.rose.utoronto.ca/publication/1994/Milgram_Takemura_SPIE1994.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area between the two extremes, where both the real and the virtual are mixed, is the so-called [[Mixed reality]]. This in turn is said to consist of both [[Augmented Reality]], where the virtual augments the real, and [[Augmented virtuality]], where the real augments the virtual.
[[Cyberspace]], the world's computer systems considered as an interconnected whole, can be thought of as a virtual reality; for instance, it is portrayed as such in the [[cyberpunk]] fiction of [[William Gibson]] and others. [[Second life]] and [[MMORPG]]s such as ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' are examples of artificial environments or [[virtual world]]s (falling some way short of full virtual reality) in cyberspace.

=== "RL" in internet culture ===
On the Internet, "[[real life]]" refers to life in the real world. It generally references [[Conditio humana|life]] or [[consensus reality]], in contrast to an environment seen as [[fiction]] or [[fantasy]], such as [[virtual reality]], [[lifelike experience]], [[dream]]s, [[novel]]s, or [[film|movies]]. Online, the [[acronym]] "IRL" stands for "in real life", with the meaning "not on the Internet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AcronymFinder.com search for IRL |url=http://www.acronymfinder.com/af-query.asp?String=exact&amp;Acronym=IRL}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sociologist]]s engaged in the study of the Internet have determined that someday, a distinction between online and real-life worlds may seem "quaint", noting that certain types of online activity, such as sexual intrigues, have already made a full transition to complete legitimacy and "reality".&lt;ref name=Slater&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Social Relationships and Identity On-line and Off-line |title=Handbook of New Media: Social Shaping and Consequences of ICTs |editors=Leah, Sonia, Lievrouw, and Livingstone |author=Don Slater |pages=533–543 |year=2002 |publisher=Sage Publications Inc |isbn=0-7619-6510-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[abbreviation]] "RL" stands for "real life". For example, one can speak of "meeting in RL" someone whom one has met in a [[online chat|chat]] or on an [[Internet forum]]. It may also be used to express an inability to use the Internet for a time due to "RL problems".

'''Reflexive self-consciousness''' is a concept, related to that of [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], formulated by [[Eugene Halliday]] during the 1940s-1950s in England. He set out his concept in his book, ''Reflexive Self-Consciousness'', which, having been circulated in softback format for many years, was published in hardback in 1989 by Melchisedec Press, {{ISBN|1-872240-01-1}}.

In his book, Eugene Halliday sets out a way by which we can develop the ability to respond adequately to the demands life makes of us, the ability to assimilate the shocks and blows of experience, so we can live a whole and balanced life. The way to this balance is through an understanding of the centre of our own being, our consciousness, and through this, finding our place in relation to the universe.

==Meaning of reflexive self-consciousness==
Eugene Halliday made a lifelong study of [[art]], [[religion]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]] and [[science]]. From his understanding, he formulated a coherent set of ideas. In his seminal work "Reflexive Self-Consciousness", he sets out the nature of [[consciousness]] and its relation to the world of phenomena, being, and mankind. From this, he explains how consciousness itself can become "reflexive". By this he means that consciousness becomes completely self-transparent and continuously aware of its own presence and nature.

He says that when observing a thing or situation one can promote this reflexive state by turning our own consciousness back onto itself. "It is the self, which is consciousness itself which is observing this thing, this self I am, I return to the self." By placing our nature as observer at the heart of his work, Halliday sets out a method by which to liberate ourselves from object-identification, which locks us into a cycle of conditioned reflexes, pleasure pursuit and pain avoidance.

He sees a complex structure of cells, such as the brain, as "a vehicle for the expression of the complex processes of consciousness" and not as the origin of that consciousness. No matter how complex the arrangement, consciousness cannot arise from the biochemical interactions of a large number of non-sentient particles.

==Origin of being==
Halliday posits that the ultimate source and origin of our being is sentience or consciousness. He sees this origin as an infinite field of sentient power. Halliday compares the activity of this infinite field of sentient power, the source of all beings, to that of the sea. Its internal movements, its waves, create vortices within it, which give rise to all the observable phenomena of the world. [[Atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, [[cell (biology)|cells]], [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, mankind, human beings, all are formed within this infinite sentient field, and all are sentient. There is no non-sentient level of being. Thus agreeing with the philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]] when he said "there are no dead gaps in Nature". This infinite field of sentient power, which is the ultimate source of the universe and all within it, is the Godhead of the theologians, the Absolute of the philosophers.

==Involution==
Before evolution, Eugene Halliday posits an "involution", whereby the motions of this absolute sentient power creates the universe and all the beings in it. Consciousness tends to fall into identification with beings, down to the grossest physical level of the mineral world. Through the process of evolution, sentience evolves through mineral, plant, animal and human to rediscover its true nature as Consciousness itself, at one with the infinite field of consciousness. This return of consciousness to its source, is the ''Reflexive Self-Consciousness'' of the title of the book.

'''Signal-to-Quantization-Noise Ratio''' ('''SQNR''' or '''SN&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;R''') is widely used quality measure in analysing [[digitizing]] schemes such as PCM ([[Pulse-code modulation|pulse code modulation]]) and [[multimedia codec]]s. The SQNR reflects the relationship between the maximum nominal [[signal strength]] and the [[quantization error]] (also known as quantization noise)  introduced in the [[analog-to-digital conversion]].

The SQNR formula is derived from the general SNR ([[signal-to-noise ratio|Signal-to-Noise Ratio]]) formula for the binary pulse-code [[Modulation|modulated]] [[Channel (communications)|communication channel]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SNR}=\frac{3 \times 2^{2n}}{1+4P_e \times (2^{2n} - 1)} \frac{m_m(t)^2}{m_p(t)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;P_e&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of received bit error
:&lt;math&gt;m_p(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the peak message signal level
:&lt;math&gt;m_m(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the mean message signal level

As SQNR applies to quantized signals, the formulae for SQNR refer to discrete-time digital signals. Instead of &lt;math&gt;m(t)&lt;/math&gt;, we will use the digitized signal &lt;math&gt;x(n)&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; quantization steps, each sample, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; requires &lt;math&gt;\nu=\log_2 N&lt;/math&gt; bits. The [[probability distribution function]] (pdf) representing the distribution of values in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and can be denoted as &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. The maximum magnitude value of any &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;x_{max}&lt;/math&gt;.

As SQNR, like SNR, is a ratio of signal power to some noise power, it can be calculated as:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SQNR} = \frac{P_{signal}}{P_{noise}} = \frac{E[x^2]}{E[\tilde{x}^2]}&lt;/math&gt;
The signal power is:
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{x^2} = E[x^2] = P_{x^\nu}=\int_{}^{}x^2f(x)dx&lt;/math&gt; 
The quantization noise power can be expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;E[\tilde{x}^2] = \frac{x_{max}^2}{3\times4^\nu}&lt;/math&gt;
Giving:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SQNR} = \frac{3 \times 4^\nu\times \overline{x^2}}{x_{max}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

When the SQNR is desired in terms of [[Decibels|Decibels (dB)]], a useful approximation to SQNR is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SQNR}|_{dB}=P_{x^\nu}+6\nu+4.8&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the number of bits in a quantized sample, and &lt;math&gt;P_{x^\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is the signal power calculated above. Note that for each bit added to a sample, the SQNR goes up by approximately 6dB (&lt;math&gt;20\times log_{10}(2)&lt;/math&gt;).

'''Social constructionism''' is  a [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]] in [[sociology]] and [[communication theory]] that examines the development of jointly constructed understandings of the world that form the basis for shared assumptions about reality. The theory centers on the notion that meanings are developed in coordination with others rather than separately within each individual.&lt;ref&gt;Leeds-Hurwitz, W. (2009). Social construction of reality. In S. Littlejohn, &amp; K. Foss (Eds.), Encyclopedia of communication theory. (pp. 891). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc. {{DOI|10.4135/9781412959384.n344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social constructionism questions what is defined by humans and society to be reality. Therefore, social constructs can be different based on the society and the events surrounding the time period in which they exist.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Mr. Sinn|title=Theoretical Perspectives: Social Constructionism|date=2016-02-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UrDIfdTRpo|accessdate=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a social construct is money or the concept of currency, as people in society have agreed to give it importance/ value.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Citation|last=khanacademymedicine|title=Social constructionism {{!}} Society and Culture {{!}} MCAT {{!}} Khan Academy|date=2013-09-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U2XAJNazik|accessdate=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of a social construction is the concept of self/ self-identity. [[Charles Cooley]] stated based on his [[Looking-glass self|Looking-Glass-Self]] theory: "I am not who you think I am; I am not who I think I am; I am who I think you think I am."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This demonstrates how people in society construct ideas or concepts that may not exist without the existence of people or language to validate those concepts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lc23548.wordpress.com/social-constructionism/|title=Social constructionism|date=2017-12-04|work=Study Journal|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are weak and strong social constructs.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Weak social constructs rely on [[brute fact]]s (which are fundamental facts that are difficult to explain or understand, such as [[quark]]s) or institutional facts (which are formed from social conventions).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Strong social constructs rely on the human perspective and knowledge that doesn't just exist, but is rather constructed by society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Definition ==
A social construct or construction concerns the meaning, notion, or connotation placed on an object or event by a society, and adopted by the inhabitants of that society with respect to how they view or deal with the object or event.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} In that respect, a social construct as an idea would be widely accepted as natural by the society.

A major focus of social constructionism is to uncover the ways in which individuals and groups participate in the construction of their perceived social reality. It involves looking at the ways [[social phenomena]] are developed, [[Institutionalization (disambiguation)|institutionalized]], known, and made into [[tradition]] by humans.

== Origins ==
In terms of background, social constructionism is rooted in "[[symbolic interactionism]]" and "phenomenology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2018/entries/phenomenology/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=David Woodruff|last=Smith|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=29 May 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Social Construction of Leadership: A Sailing Guide|url = http://mcq.sagepub.com/content/24/2/171|journal = Management Communication Quarterly|date = 2010-05-01|issn = 0893-3189|pages = 171–210|volume = 24|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/0893318909359697|language = en|first = Gail T.|last = Fairhurst|first2 = David|last2 = Grant}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Berger and Luckmann's ''The Social Construction of Reality'' published in 1966, this concept found its hold. More than four decades later, a sizable number of theory and research pledged to the basic tenet that people "make their social and cultural worlds at the same time these worlds make them."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; It is a viewpoint that uproots social processes "simultaneously playful and serious, by which reality is both revealed and concealed, created and destroyed by our activities."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; It provides a substitute to the "Western intellectual tradition" where the researcher "earnestly seeks certainty in a representation of reality by means of propositions."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

In social constructionist terms, "taken-for-granted realities" are cultivated from "interactions between and among social agents;" furthermore, reality is not some objective truth "waiting to be uncovered through positivist scientific inquiry."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Rather, there can be "multiple realities that compete for truth and legitimacy."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Social constructionism understands the "fundamental role of language and communication" and this understanding has "contributed to the linguistic turn" and more recently the "turn to [[discourse]] theory."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/janettie/discourse-theory|title=Discourse Theory|last=Janet Tibaldo|date=19 September 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of social constructionists abide by the belief that "language does not mirror reality; rather, it constitutes [creates] it."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

A broad definition of social constructionism has its supporters and critics in the organizational sciences.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; A constructionist approach to various organizational and managerial phenomena appear to be more commonplace and on the rise.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Andy Lock and Tomj Strong trace some of the fundamental tenets of social constructionism back to the work of the 18th century Italian political philosopher, rhetorician, historian, and jurist [[Giambattista Vico]].&lt;ref&gt;Andy Lock and Tom Strong.2010. ''Social Constructionism: Sources and Stirrings in Theory and Practice''. Cambridge University Press, pp. 12-29&lt;/ref&gt;

Berger and Luckmann give credit to [[Max Scheler]] as a large influence as he created the idea of [[Sociology of knowledge]] which influenced social construction theory.&lt;ref&gt;Leeds-Hurwitz, W. (2009). Social construction of reality. In S. Littlejohn, &amp; K. Foss (Eds.), Encyclopedia of communication theory. (pp. 8-9). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc. {{DOI|10.4135/9781412959384.n344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lock and Strong, other influential thinkers whose work has affected the development of social constructionism are: [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Alfred Schutz]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Paul Ricoeur]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Valentin Volosinov]], [[Lev Vygotsky]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Harold Garfinkel]], [[Erving Goffman]], [[Anthony Giddens]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Ken Gergen]], [[Mary Gergen]], [[Rom Harre]], and [[John Shotter]].&lt;ref&gt;Andy Lock and Tom Strong.2010.

===Personal construct psychology===
Since its appearance in the 1950s, [[personal construct psychology]] (PCP) has mainly developed as a constructivist theory of personality and a system of transforming individual [[meaning-making]] processes, largely in therapeutic contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Bannister, D., &amp; Mair, M.M. (1968) ''The evaluation of personal constructs''. London, UK: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Kelly (psychologist)|Kelly, G.A.]] (1955), ''The psychology of personal constructs''. New York, NY: Norton&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mair, J.M. (1977), ''The community of self''. In D. Bannister (Ed.), ''New perspectives in personal construct theory'' (pp. 125–149). London, UK: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neimeyer, R.A., &amp; Levitt, H. (2000), ''What’s narrative got to do with it? Construction and coherence in accounts of loss''. In J. Harvey (Ed.), Loss and trauma (pp. 401–412). Philadelphia, PA: Brunner Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Procter, H.G. (1981), ''Family construct psychology''. In S. Walrond-Skinner (Ed.), ''Family therapy and approaches'' (pp. 350–367). London, UK: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stojnov, D., &amp; Butt, T. (2002), ''The relational basis of personal construct psychology''. In R. Neimeyer &amp; G. Neimeyer (Eds.), ''Advances of personal construct theory: New directions and perspectives'' (pp. 81–113). Westport, CT: Praeger&lt;/ref&gt; It was based around the notion of persons as scientists who form and test theories about their worlds. Therefore, it represented one of the first attempts to appreciate the constructive nature of experience and the meaning persons give to their experience.&lt;ref&gt;Harré, R., &amp; Gillett, D. (1994). The discursive mind. London, UK: Sage&lt;/ref&gt; Social constructionism (SC), on the other hand, mainly developed as a form of a critique,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shotter | first1 = J. | last2 = Lannamann | first2 = J. | year = 2002 | title = The situation of social constructionism: Its imprisonment within the ritual of theory-criticism-and-debate | url = | journal = [[Theory &amp; Psychology]] | volume = 12 | issue = 5| pages = 577–609 | doi=10.1177/0959354302012005894}}&lt;/ref&gt; aimed to transform the oppressing effects of the social meaning-making processes. Over the years, it has grown into a cluster of different approaches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harré | first1 = R | year = 2002 | title = Public sources of the personal mind: Social constructionism in context | url = | journal = Theory &amp; Psychology | volume = 12 | issue = 5| pages = 611–623 | doi=10.1177/0959354302012005895}}&lt;/ref&gt; with no single SC position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stam | first1 = H.J. | year = 2001 | title = Introduction: Social constructionism and its critiques | url = | journal = Theory &amp; Psychology | volume = 11 | issue = 3| pages = 291–296 | doi=10.1177/0959354301113001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, different approaches under the generic term of SC are loosely linked by some shared assumptions about language, knowledge, and reality.&lt;ref&gt;Burr, V. (1995), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LIiJAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An introduction to social constructionism]''. London, UK: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

A usual way of thinking about the relationship between PCP and SC is treating them as two separate entities that are similar in some aspects, but also very different in others. This way of conceptualizing this relationship is a logical result of the circumstantial differences of their emergence. In subsequent analyses these differences between PCP and SC were framed around several points of tension, formulated as binary oppositions: personal/social; individualist/relational; agency/structure; constructivist/constructionist.&lt;ref&gt;Botella, L.

Reframing the relationship between PCP and SC may be of use in both the PCP and the SC communities. On one hand, it extends and enriches SC theory and points to benefits of applying the PCP “toolkit” in constructionist therapy and research. On the other hand, the reframing contributes to PCP theory and points to new ways of addressing social construction in therapeutic conversations.&lt;ref&gt;Pavlović, J. (2011). Personal construct psychology and social constructionism are not incompatible: Implications of a reframing Theory &amp; Psychology 21: 396–411.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational psychology===
Like social constructionism, [[social constructivism]] states that people work together to construct [[Social artifact|artifacts]]. While social constructionism focuses on the artifacts that are created through the social interactions of a group, social constructivism focuses on an individual's learning that takes place because of his or her interactions in a group.

Social constructivism has been studied by many educational psychologists, who are concerned with its implications for teaching and learning. For more on the psychological dimensions of social constructivism, see the work of [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]] and A. Sullivan Palincsar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = von Glasersfeld | first1 = Ernst | year = 1995 | title = Radical Constructivism: A Way of Knowing and Learning|location= London|publisher= Routledge }}; {{cite journal | last1=Palincsar|first1= A.S. |year=1998|title= Social constructivist perspectives on teaching and learning | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.345 |pmid= 15012472 | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 345–375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systemic therapy===
[[Systemic therapy]] is a form of psychotherapy which seeks to address people as people in relationship, dealing with the interactions of groups and their interactional patterns and dynamics.

===Communication studies===
A bibliographic review of social constructionism as used within [[communication studies]] was published in 2016. It features a good overview of resources from that disciplinary perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Leeds-Hurwitz, W. (2016). "Social construction". In P. Moy (Ed.), ''Oxford bibliographies in communication''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teleology of social construction ==
The concepts of ''weak'' and '''strong''' as applied to opposing [[philosophical position]]s, "isms", inform a [[teleology]]{{spaced ndash}}the goal-oriented, meaningful or "final end" of an interpretation of reality. "Isms" are not personal opinions, but the extreme, modal, formulations that actual persons, individuals, can then consider, and take a position between. There are opposing philosophical positions concerning the feasibility of co-creating a common, shared, social reality, called ''weak'' and '''strong'''.

[[John R. Searle]] does not elucidate the terms '''strong''' and ''weak'' in his book ''The Construction of Social Reality'',&lt;ref name="cosr"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Construction of Social Reality |last=Searle |first=John |year=1995 |publisher=The Free Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-684-83179-4 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he clearly uses them in his [[Chinese room]] argument, where he debates the feasibility of creating a computing machine with a sharable understanding of reality, and he adds [[Chinese room#Computers vs. machines vs. brains|"We are precisely such machines."]] '''Strong''' artificial intelligence ([[Artificial general intelligence|Strong AI]]) is the bet that computer programmers will somehow eventually achieve a computing machine with a mind of its own, and that it will eventually be more powerful than a human mind. Weak AI bets they won't.

[[David Deutsch]] in his book ''[[The Fabric of Reality#The Church–Turing thesis|The Fabric of Reality]]'' uses a form of '''strong''' [[Turing principle]] to share [[Frank Tipler]]'s view of the final state of the universe as an omnipotent (but not [[Omniscience|omniscient]]), [[Omega point]], computer. ''But this computer is a society of creative thinkers, or people'' (albeit posthuman transhuman persons), having debates in order to generate information, in the never-ending attempt to attain omniscience of this physics{{mdash}}its evolutionary forms, its computational abilities, and the methods of its epistemology{{mdash}}having an eternity to do so. (p.&amp;nbsp;356)

Because both the Chinese room argument and the construction of social reality deal with Searle and his debates, and because they both use ''weak'' and '''strong''' to denote a philosophical position, and because both debate the programmability of "the other", it is worth noting the correspondence that "strong AI" is '''strong''' social constructionism, and "weak AI" is weak social constructivism.

Strong social constructiv''ism'' says "none are able to ''communicate'' either a full reality or an accurate ontology, therefore my position must impose, by a sort of [[Divine right of kings|divine right]], my observer-relative epistemology", whereas weak social constructiv''ism'' says "none are able to ''know'' a full reality, therefore ''we must'' cooperate, informing and conveying an objective ontology as best we can."&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John R. (New York: Free Press, 1997) The Constructions of Social Reality (p. 365)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weak teleology {{anchor|Weak}}===
''Weak social constructionism'' sees the underlying, objective, "[[brute fact]]" elements of the class of languages and functional assignments of human, metaphysical, reality. Brute facts are all facts that are not institutional facts (e.g., metaphysical, social agreement). The skeptic portrays the ''weak'' aspect of social constructivism, and wants to spend effort debating the institutional realities.

Harvard psychologist [[Steven Pinker]]&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, Steven (Penguin Books, 2002) The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature (p. 202)&lt;/ref&gt; writes that "some categories really are social constructions: they exist only because people tacitly agree to act as if they exist. Examples include money, [[tenure]], [[citizenship]], decorations for bravery, and the presidency of the United States."

In a similar vein, [[Stanley Fish]]&lt;ref&gt;Fish, Stanley (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that baseball's "balls and strikes" are social constructions.&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, Ian (1999) (pp. 29-31)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29–31}}

Both Fish and Pinker agree that the sorts of [[object (philosophy)|object]]s indicated here can be described as part of what [[John Searle]] calls "social reality."&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, Ian (1999)(p. 22)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}} In particular, they are, in Searle's terms, [[Ontology|ontologically]] [[Subjectivity|subjective]] but [[Epistemology|epistemologically]] [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]].&lt;ref name="cosr" /&gt;{{rp|63}} "Social facts" are temporally, ontologically, and logically dependent on "brute facts." For example, "money" in the form of its raw materials (rag, pulp, ink) as constituted socially for barter (for example by a banking system) is a social fact of "money" by virtue of (i) collectively willing and intending (ii) to impose some particular function (purpose for which), (iii) by constitutive rules atop the "brute facts." "Social facts have the remarkable feature of having no analogue among physical brute facts" (34). The existence of language is itself constitutive of the social fact (37), which natural or brute facts do not require. Natural or "brute" facts exist independently of language; thus a "mountain" is a mountain in every language and in no language; it simply is what it is.&lt;ref name="cosr" /&gt;{{rp|29, et seq}}

Searle illustrates the evolution of social facts from brute facts by the constitutive rule: X counts as Y in C. "The Y terms has to assign a new ''status'' that the object does not already have just in virtue of satisfying the Y term; and there has to be collective agreement, or at least acceptance, both in the imposition of that status on the stuff referred to by the X term and about the function that goes with that status. Furthermore, because the physical features brute facts specified by the X term are insufficient by themselves to guarantee the fulfillment of the assigned function specified by the Y term, the new status and its attendant functions have to be the sort of things that can be constituted by collective agreement or acceptance."&lt;ref name="cosr" /&gt;{{rp|44}}

It is true or false that language is not a "brute fact," that it is an institutional fact, a human convention, a metaphysical reality (that happens to be physically uttered), but Searle points out that there are language-independent thoughts "noninstitutional, primitive, biological inclinations and cognitions not requiring any linguistic devices," and that there are many "brute facts" amongst both humans and animals that are truths that should not be altered in the social constructs because language does not truly constitute them, despite the attempt to institute them for any [[Group think|group's gain]]: money and property are language dependent, but desires (thirst, hunger) and emotions (fear, rage) are not.&lt;ref name="cosr" /&gt;{{rp|62}} ([[Meditations on First Philosophy|Descartes]] describes the difference between imagination as a sort of vision, or image, and intellect as conceptualizing things by symbolic manipulation.) Therefore, there is doubt that society or a computer can be completely programmed by language and images, (because there is a programmable, emotive effect of images that derives from the language of judgment towards images).

Finally, against the strong theory and for the weak theory, Searle insists, "it could not be the case, as some have maintained, that all facts are institutional [i.e., social] facts, that there are no brute facts, because the structure of institutional facts reveals that they are logically dependent on brute facts. To suppose that all facts are institutional [i.e., social] would produce an infinite regress or circularity in the account of institutional facts. In order that some facts are institutional, there must be other facts that are brute [i.e., physical, biological, natural]. This is the consequence of the logical structure of institutional facts.".&lt;ref name="cosr" /&gt;{{rp|56}}

[[Ian Hacking]], [[Canadians|Canadian]] philosopher of science, insists, "the notion that everything is socially constructed has been going the rounds. John Searle [1995] argues vehemently (and in my opinion cogently) against universal constructionism."&lt;ref name="Hacking1999"&gt;Hacking, Ian. ''The Social Construction of What? ''. Harvard University Press, 1999; {{ISBN|0-674-00412-4}}, Numbering begins with 0 for consistency with Hacking's usage.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}} "Universal social constructionism is descended from the doctrine that I once named linguistic idealism and attributed, only half in jest, to Richard Nixon [Hacking, 1975, p. 182]. Linguistic idealism is the doctrine that only what is talked about exists, nothing has reality until it is spoken of, or written about. This extravagant notion is descended from Berkeley's idea-ism, which we call idealism: the doctrine that all that exists is mental."&lt;ref name="Hacking1999"/&gt;{{rp|24}} "They are a part of what John Searle [1995] calls social reality. His book is titled the ''Construction of Social Reality,'' and as I explained elsewhere [Hacking, 1996], that is not a ''social'' construction book at all."&lt;ref name="Hacking1999"/&gt;{{rp|12}}

Hacking observes, "the label 'social constructionism' is more code than description"&lt;ref name="Hacking1999"/&gt;{{rp|15}} of every Leftist, Marxist, Freudian, and Feminist PostModernist to call into question every moral, sex, gender, power, and deviant claim as just another essentialist claim—including the claim that members of the male and female sex are inherently different, rather than historically and socially constructed. Hacking observes that his 1995 simplistic dismissal of the concept actually revealed to many readers the outrageous implications of the theorists: Is child abuse a real evil, or a social construct, asked Hacking? His dismissive attitude, "gave some readers a way to see that there need be no clash between construction and reality,"&lt;ref name="Hacking1999"/&gt;{{rp|29}} inasmuch as "the metaphor of social construction once had excellent shock value, but now it has become tired."&lt;ref name="Hacking1999"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

Informally, they require human practices to sustain their existence, but they have an effect that is (basically) universally agreed upon. The disagreement lies in whether this category should be called "socially constructed." Ian Hacking&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, Ian. 1997&lt;/ref&gt; argues that it should not. Furthermore, it is not clear that authors who write "social construction" analyses ever mean "social construction" in Pinker's sense. ".&lt;ref&gt;Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann, The Social Construction of Reality : A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge" (Anchor, 1967; {{ISBN|0-385-05898-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; If they never do, then Pinker (probably among others) has misunderstood the point of a social constructionist argument.

To understand how weak social constructionism can conclude that metaphysics (a human affair) is not the entire "reality," see the arguments [[Metaphysics#The value and future of metaphysics|against the study of metaphysics]]. This inability to accurately share the ''full'' reality, even given time for a rational conversation, is similarly proclaimed by ''weak artificial intelligence''.

== History and development ==
===Berger and Luckmann===
Constructionism became prominent in the U.S. with [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]]'s 1966 book, ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]''. Berger and Luckmann argue that all knowledge, including the most basic, taken-for-granted [[common sense]] knowledge of everyday reality, is derived from and maintained by [[social interactions]]. When people interact, they do so with the understanding that their respective perceptions of reality are related, and as they act upon this understanding their common knowledge of reality becomes reinforced. Since this common sense knowledge is negotiated by people, human [[typification]]s, [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]ifications and [[social institution|institution]]s come to be presented as part of an objective reality, particularly for future generations who were not involved in the original process of negotiation. For example, as parents negotiate rules for their children to follow, those rules confront the children as externally produced "givens" that they cannot change. Berger and Luckmann's social constructionism has its roots in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. It links to [[Heidegger]] and [[Edmund Husserl]] through the teaching of [[Alfred Schutz]], who was also Berger's PhD adviser.

===Narrative turn===
During the 1970s and 1980s, social constructionist theory underwent a transformation as constructionist sociologists engaged with the work of [[Michel Foucault]] and others as a [[narrative turn]] in the social sciences was worked out in practice. This particularly affected the emergent [[sociology of science]] and the growing field of [[science and technology studies]]. In particular, [[Karin Knorr-Cetina]], [[Bruno Latour]], [[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]], [[Steve Woolgar]], and others used social constructionism to relate what science has typically characterized as objective facts to the processes of social construction, with the goal of showing that human [[subjectivity]] imposes itself on those facts we take to be objective, not solely the other way around. A particularly provocative title in this line of thought is [[Andrew Pickering]]'s ''Constructing Quarks: A Sociological History of Particle Physics''. At the same time, Social Constructionism shaped studies of technology – the Sofield, especially on the [[Social construction of technology]], or [[SCOT]], and authors as [[Wiebe Bijker]], [[Trevor Pinch]], [[Maarten van Wesel]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Pinch, T. J. (1996). The Social Construction of Technology: a Review. In R. Fox (Ed.), Technological Change; Methods and Themes in the History of Technology (pp. 17 – 35). Amsterdam: Harwood Academic Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wesel, M. v. (2006). Why we do not always get what we want; The power imbalance in the Social Shaping of Technology (final draft 29 June 2006). Unpublished Master Thesis, Universiteit Maastricht, Maastricht ([https://archive.is/20120914093955/http://www.personeel.unimaas.nl/maarten.wesel/index.htm Look for the latest version here]).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its common perception as objective, mathematics is not immune to social constructionist accounts. Sociologists such as [[Sal Restivo]] and [[Randall Collins]], mathematicians including [[Reuben Hersh]] and [[Philip J. Davis]], and philosophers including [[Paul Ernest]] have published social constructionist treatments of mathematics.

===Postmodernism===
Social constructionism can be seen as a source of the [[postmodernism|postmodern]] movement, and has been influential in the field of [[cultural studies]]. Some have gone so far as to attribute the rise of cultural studies (the [[cultural turn]]) to social constructionism. Within the social constructionist strand of postmodernism, the concept of socially constructed reality stresses the ongoing mass-building of [[worldview]]s by [[individual]]s in [[dialectic]]al interaction with society at a time. The numerous [[reality|realities]] so formed comprise, according to this view, the [[Imagined communities|imagined worlds]] of human social existence and activity, gradually crystallized by [[habituation|habit]] into institutions propped up by [[language]] conventions, given ongoing legitimacy by [[mythology]], religion and philosophy, maintained by therapies and [[socialization]], and subjectively [[internalisation (sociology)|internalized]] by upbringing and education to become part of the [[identity (social science)|identity]] of social citizens.

In the book ''The Reality of Social Construction'', the British sociologist Dave Elder-Vass places the development of social constructionism as one outcome of the legacy of postmodernism. He writes "Perhaps the most widespread and influential product of this process [coming to terms with the legacy of postmodernism] is social constructionism, which has been booming [within the domain of social theory] since the 1980s."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Dave Elder-Vass. 2012.''The Reality of Social Construction''. Cambridge University Press, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Social constructionism falls toward the nurture end of the spectrum of the larger [[nature and nurture]] debate. Consequently, critics have argued that it generally ignores biological influences on behaviour or culture, or suggests that they are unimportant to achieve an understanding of human behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, A., &amp; Bricmont, J. (1999). Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science. NY: Picador.&lt;/ref&gt; The view of most psychologists and social scientists is that behaviour is a complex outcome of both biological and cultural influences.&lt;ref&gt;Francsis, D., &amp; Kaufer, D. (2011). [http://the-scientist.com/2011/10/01/beyond-nature-vs-nurture/ Beyond Nature vs. Nurture]. The Scientist. 1 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridly, M. (2004). The Agile Gene: How Nature Turns on Nurture. NY: Harper.&lt;/ref&gt; Other disciplines, such as [[evolutionary psychology]], [[behaviour genetics]], [[behavioural neuroscience]], [[epigenetics]], etc., take a nature–nurture interactionism approach to understand behaviour or cultural phenomena.

In 1996, to illustrate what he believed to be the intellectual weaknesses of social constructionism and postmodernism, physics professor [[Alan Sokal]] submitted an article to the academic journal ''[[Social Text]]'' deliberately written to be incomprehensible but including phrases and jargon typical of the articles published by the journal. The submission, which was published, was an experiment to see if the journal would "publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html |title=A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies |accessdate=3 April 2007 |last=Sokal |first=Alan D. |authorlink=Alan Sokal |work=''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'' |date=May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Postmodernism Generator]] is a computer program that is designed to produce similarly incomprehensible text.&lt;ref&gt;A C Bulhak: On the simulation of postmodernism and mental debility using recursive transition networks, 96/264, Dept Computer Science Technical Reports, Dept Computer Science, Monash Univ, Melbourne Australia, 1–12, 12pp. Technical report CS 96/264&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Sokal, with coauthor Jean Bricmont published the book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'', which criticized [[postmodernism]] and social constructionism.

Philosopher [[Paul Boghossian]] has also written against social constructionism. He follows Ian Hacking's argument that many adopt social constructionism because of its potentially liberating stance: if things are the way that they are only because of our social conventions, as opposed to being so naturally, then it should be possible to change them into how we would rather have them be. He then states that social constructionists argue that we should refrain from making absolute judgements about what is true and instead state that something is true in the light of this or that theory. Countering this, he states:
{{quote|But it is hard to see how we might coherently follow this advice. Given that the propositions which make up epistemic systems are just very general propositions about what absolutely justifies what, it makes no sense to insist that we abandon making absolute ''particular'' judgements about what justifies what while allowing us to ''accept'' absolute ''general'' judgements about what justifies what. But in effect this is what the epistemic relativist is recommending.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Boghossian, ''Fear of Knowledge: Against Relativism and Conmstructivism'', Oxford University Press, 2006, 152pp, hb/pb, {{ISBN|0-19-928718-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later in the same work, Boghossian severely constrains the requirements of relativism. He states that instead of believing that any world view is just as true as any other ([[cultural relativism]]), we should believe that:
{{quote|If we were to encounter an ''actual'', coherent, fundamental, genuine alternative to our epistemic system, C2, whose track record was ''impressive'' enough to make us doubt the correctness of our own system, C1, we would not be able to justify C1 over C2 even by our own lights.}}

Woolgar and Pawluch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woolgar | first1 = S | last2 = Pawluch | first2 = D | year = 1985 | title = Ontological gerrymandering: The anatomy of social problems explanations | url = | journal = Social Problems | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 214–27 | doi=10.1525/sp.1985.32.3.03a00020}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that constructionists tend to 'ontological gerrymander' social conditions in and out of their analysis. Following this point, Thibodeaux&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thibodeaux | first1 = Jarrett | year = 2014 | title = Three Versions of Constructionism and their Reliance on Social Conditions in Social Problems Research | url = | journal = Sociology | volume = 48 | issue = 4| pages = 829–837 | doi=10.1177/0038038513511560}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that constructionism can both separate and combine a subject and their effective environment. To resolve this he argued that objective conditions should be used when analyzing how perspectives are motivated.

Social constructionism has been criticized by psychologists such as University of Toronto Professor [[Jordan Peterson]] and evolutionary psychologists, including [[Steven Pinker]] in his book ''[[The Blank Slate]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://quarterlyconversation.com/against-steven-pinkers-the-blank-slate|title=Breaking the Code: Against Steven Pinker's The Blank Slate {{!}} Quarterly Conversation|website=quarterlyconversation.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Tooby]] and [[Leda Cosmides]] used the term "[[standard social science model]]" to refer to social-science philosophies that they argue fail to take into account the evolved properties of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Barkow, J., Cosmides, L. &amp; Tooby, J. 1992. ''The adapted mind: Evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''standard language''' or '''standard variety''' is either as a language [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] used by a population for public purposes, or a variety that has undergone standardization.{{sfn|Finegan|2007|p=14}}
Typically, varieties that become standardized are the local [[dialect]]s spoken in the centers of [[commerce]] and [[government]], where a need arises for a variety that will serve more than local needs.
Standardization typically involves a fixed orthography, codification in authoritative grammars and dictionaries and public acceptance of these standards.
A standard [[written language]] is sometimes termed by the [[German language|German]] word ''Schriftsprache''.

A [[pluricentric language]] has multiple interacting standard varieties.{{sfn|Stewart|1968|p=534}}{{sfn|Kloss|1967|p=31}}{{sfn|Clyne|1992|p=1}}
Examples include [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]],  [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[German language|German]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Serbo-Croatian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]].{{sfn|Clyne|1992|pp=1–3}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |editor1-last=Madelain |editor1-first=Anne |title=Au sud de l'Est |series=vol. 3 |publisher=Non Lieu |pages=71–78 |language=French |chapter=La langue croate, serbe, bosniaque et monténégrine |trans-chapter=Croatian, Serbian, Bosniakian, and Montenegrin |chapterurl=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/429734.LA_LANGUE_CROATE_SERBE.PDF |deadurl=no |location=Paris |year=2007 |isbn=978-2-35270-036-4 |oclc=182916790 |archivedate=4 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69f5WqGAx?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/429734.LA_LANGUE_CROATE_SERBE.PDF |accessdate=8 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Monocentric languages, such as [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], have only one standardized version.{{sfn|Clyne|1992|p=3}}

== Standardization ==

A standard variety is developed from a group of related varieties.
This may be done by elevating a single variety, such as the local variety of a center of government or culture.
Alternatively, a new variety may be defined as a selection of features from existing varieties.{{sfn|Ammon|2004|p=275}}
A fixed orthography is typically created for writing the variety.
It may be codified in normative [[dictionaries]] and [[linguistic description|grammar]]s, or by an agreed collection of exemplary texts.{{sfn|Ammon|2004|p=275}}
Whether these dictionaries and grammars are created by private individuals (like ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'') or by state institutions, they become standard if they are treated as authorities for correcting language.{{sfn|Ammon|2004|p=276}}
A fixed written form and subsequent codification make the standard variety more stable than purely spoken varieties, and provide a base for further development or ''[[ausbau]]''.{{sfn|Ammon|2004|p=275}}
This variety becomes the norm for writing, is used in broadcasting and for official purposes, and is the form taught to non-native learners.{{sfn|Trudgill|2006|p=119}}

Through this process, the standard variety acquires [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] and a greater functional importance than local varieties.{{sfn|Trudgill|2006|p=119}}
Those varieties are said to be dependent on, or [[autonomy and heteronomy (sociolinguistics)|heteronomous]] with respect to, the standard variety, because speakers read and write the standard, refer to it as an authority is such matters as specialist vocabulary, and any standardizing changes in their speech are towards that standard.{{sfn|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|p=9}}
In some cases, such as [[Standard English]], this process may take place over an extended period without government intervention.
In others it may be deliberately directed by official institutions, such as the [[Académie française]] or [[Royal Spanish Academy|Real Academia Española]], and can proceed much more quickly.{{sfn|Trudgill|2006|p=119}}

Language standardization is often linked to the formation, or attempted formation, of [[nation states]], as language is seen as the vehicle of a shared culture.{{sfn|Inoue|2006|p=122}}
Different national standards derived from a [[dialect continuum]] may be regarded as different languages, even if they are [[mutually intelligible]].{{sfn|Stewart|1968}}{{sfn|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|p=11}}
The [[North Germanic language|Scandinavian languages]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], are often cited as examples.{{sfn|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|pp=3–4}}

In other cases governments or neighbouring populations may seek to deny a standard independent status.{{sfn|Inoue|2006|pp=123–124}}
In response, developers of a standard may base it on more divergent varieties.
Thus after [[Norway]] became independent at the start of the 20th century, the [[Bokmål]] standard based on the speech of [[Oslo]] was felt to be too similar to [[Danish language|Danish]] by [[Ivar Aasen]], who developed a rival [[Nynorsk]] standard based on western varieties.
Similarly, when a standard was developed in the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|Yugoslav republic of Macedonia]] from local varieties within a continuum with [[Serbia]] to the north and [[Bulgaria]] to the east, it was deliberately based on varieties from the west of the republic that were most different from standard [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]].
Now known as [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], it is the national standard of the independent [[Republic of Macedonia]], but viewed by Bulgarians as a dialect of Bulgarian.{{sfn|Trudgill|1992|pp=173–174}}

==Examples==
{{see also|List of language regulators}}

===Chinese===
[[Chinese language|Chinese]] consists of hundreds of [[varieties of Chinese|local varieties]], many of which are not mutually intelligible, usually classified into seven to ten major groups, including [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Yue Chinese|Yue]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Min Chinese|Min]].
Before the 20th century, most Chinese spoke only their local variety.
For two millennia, formal writing had been done in [[Literary Chinese]] (or Classical Chinese), a style modelled on the [[Chinese classics|classics]] and far removed from any contemporary speech.{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=108–109, 245}}
As a practical measure, officials of the late imperial dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|common language based on Mandarin varieties]], known as ''Guānhuà'' (literally "speech of officials").{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=133, 136}}

In the early 20th century, many Chinese intellectuals argued that the country needed a standardized language.
By the 1920s, Literary Chinese had been replaced as the written standard by [[written vernacular Chinese]], which was based on Mandarin dialects.{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=133–134}}
In the 1930s, [[Standard Chinese]] was adopted, with its pronunciation based on the [[Beijing dialect]], but with vocabulary also drawn from other Mandarin varieties and its syntax based on the written vernacular.{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=135}}
It is the official spoken language of the [[People's Republic of China]] (where it is called ''Pǔtōnghuà''  "common speech") and of the [[Republic of China]] governing Taiwan (as ''Guóyǔ'' "national language"), and one of the official languages of [[Singapore]] (as ''Huáyǔ'' "Chinese language").{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=136–137}}
Standard Chinese now dominates public life, and is much more widely studied than any other variety of Chinese.{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=247}}

===Dutch===
Dutch is a [[Pluricentric language|monocentric language]], with all speakers using the same [[standardization|standard form]] (authorized by the [[Dutch Language Union]]) based on a [[Dutch orthography]] employing the [[Latin alphabet]] when writing. A process of standardisation of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] started in the [[Middle Ages]], especially under the influence of the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] Ducal Court in Dijon ([[Brussels]] after 1477). Till then every region spoke a different [[Middle Dutch]] dialect. The dialects of the [[County of Flanders]] and the [[Duchy of Brabant]] were the most influential around this time. The process of standardisation became much stronger at the start of the 16th century, mainly based on the urban dialect of [[Antwerp]]. In 1585 Antwerp [[Fall of Antwerp (1584–1585)|fell]] to the Spanish army: many from the [[Southern Netherlands]] fled to the [[Dutch Republic|Northern Netherlands]] (that [[Act of Abjuration|declared itself independent]] from Spain), especially to the [[County of Holland|province of Holland]], where they influenced the urban dialects. In 1637, a further important step was made towards a unified language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ccjk.com/dutch-full-historical-junk/ | title=Dutch &amp; Other Languages|publisher=Ccjk.com|accessdate=2015-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[Statenvertaling]], the first major Bible translation into Dutch, was created that people from all over the new republic could understand. It used elements from various dialects but was predominantly based on the urban dialects of Holland of post 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taal.phileon.nl/brabants.php |title=Taal in Nederland .:. Brabants |publisher=Taal.phileon.nl |accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English===
In [[British English]] the standard, known as [[Standard English]] (SE), is historically based on the language of the medieval English [[court of Chancery]].{{sfn|Smith|1996}} The late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw the establishment of this standard as the norm of "polite" society, that is to say of the [[upper class]]es.{{sfn|Blake|1996}} The spoken standard has come to be seen as a mark of good education and social prestige.{{sfn|Baugh|Cable|2002}} Although often associated with the [[Received Pronunciation|RP accent]], SE can be spoken with any accent, such as [[General American]], [[General Australian]], etc.{{sfn|Smith|1996}}

===Greek===
The standard form of [[Modern Greek]] is based on the [[Varieties of Modern Greek#Spoken dialects|Southern dialects]]; these dialects are spoken mainly in the [[Peloponnese]], the [[Ionian Islands]], [[Attica]], [[Crete]] and the [[Cyclades]].&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks, Geoffrey (1997): ''Greek: A history of the language and its speakers.'' London: Longman. Ch.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindi-Urdu===
Two standardised [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] of the [[Hindustani language]] have legal status India: [[Standard Hindi]] (one of 23 co-official national languages) and [[Urdu]] ([[Pakistan]]’s official tongue), resultantly, Hindustani often called “Hindi-Urdu".&lt;ref name=Blum&gt;{{cite book|last=Blum |first=Daniel|year=2002 |language=German |title=Sprache und Politik : Sprachpolitik und Sprachnationalismus in der Republik Indien und dem sozialistischen Jugoslawien (1945-1991) |trans-title=Language and Policy: Language Policy and Linguistic Nationalism in the Republic of India and the Socialist Yugoslavia (1945-1991) |series=Beiträge zur Südasienforschung ; vol. 192 |location=Würzburg | publisher=Ergon | page=200 |isbn=3-89913-253-X |oclc=51961066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irish===
{{main article|An Caighdeán Oifigiúil}}
''[[An Caighdeán Oifigiúil]]'' ("The Official Standard"), often shortened to ''An Caighdeán'', is official standard of the [[Irish language]]. It is taught in most schools in Ireland, though with strong influences from local dialects. It was first published by the translators in [[Dáil Éireann]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="blas"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/irish/blas/education/beginnersblas/dictionaries.shtml | title=Beginners' Blas | accessdate=18 March 2011 | date=June 2005 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Caighdeán Athbhreithnithe don Ghaeilge|url=http://www.gaelport.com/nuacht/Caighdean-athbhreithnithe-don-Ghaeilge/|accessdate=2012-08-02|newspaper=Gaelport.com|date=2012-08-02|author=Niamh Ní Shúilleabháin|language=Irish}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first major revision of the Caighdeán Oifigiúil is available, both online&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Caighdeán Oifigiúil—Caighdeán Athbhreithnithe|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/media/michelle/Final-Version.pdf|publisher=Seirbhís Thithe an Oireachtais|accessdate=2012-08-02|language=Irish|format=PDF|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foilseacháin Rialtais / Government Publications—Don tSeachtain dar críoch 25 Iúil 2012 / For the week ended 25 July 2012|url=http://www.opw.ie/en/media/wl25072012.pdf|publisher=Rialtas na hÉireann|accessdate=2012-08-02|page=2|language=Irish, English|format=PDF|date=27 July 2012|quote=M67B Gramadach na Gaeilge 9781406425766 390 10.00}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the changes to be found in the revised version are, for example, various attempts to bring the recommendations of the Caighdeán closer to the spoken dialect of Gaeltacht speakers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Caighdeán Oifigiúil—Caighdeán Athbhreithnithe|publisher=Seirbhís Thithe an Oireachtais|page=7|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/media/Oireachtas_book(211211).pdf|editor=Vivian Uíbh Eachach|language=Irish|date=January 2012|quote=Rinneadh iarracht ar leith san athbhreithniú seo foirmeacha agus leaganacha atá ar fáil go tréan sa chaint sna mórchanúintí a áireamh sa Chaighdeán Oifigiúil Athbhreithnithe sa tslí is go mbraithfeadh an gnáthchainteoir mórchanúna go bhfuil na príomhghnéithe den chanúint sin aitheanta sa Chaighdeán Oifigiúil agus, mar sin, gur gaire don ghnáthchaint an Caighdeán Oifigiúil anois ná mar a bhíodh.}}&lt;/ref&gt; including allowing further use of the nominative case where the genitive would historically have been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Caighdeán Oifigiúil—Caighdeán Athbhreithnithe|date=January 2012|publisher=Seirbhís Thithe an Oireachtais|page=7|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/media/Oireachtas_book(211211).pdf|editor=Vivian Uíbh Eachach|accessdate=2012-08-02|language=Irish|format=PDF|quote=Triaileadh, mar shampla, aitheantas a thabhairt don leathnú atá ag teacht ar úsáid fhoirm an ainmnigh in ionad an ghinidigh sa chaint.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italian===
Standard [[Italian language|Italian]] is derived from the [[Tuscan dialect]], specifically from its [[Florentine dialect|Florentine variety]] &amp;mdash; the Florentine influence upon early [[Italian literature]] established that dialect as base for the standard language of Italy. In particular, Italian became the language of culture for all the people of Italy, thanks to the prestige of the masterpieces of [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Francesco Petrarca]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], and [[Francesco Guicciardini]]. It would later become the official language of all the [[Historical states of Italy|Italian states]], and after the [[Italian unification]] it became the [[national language]] of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://linguistics.byu.edu/classes/ling450ch/reports/Italian2.html A Brief History of the Italian Language by Cory Crawford]. linguistics.byu.edu&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[Italian language|Standard Italian]]'s lexicon has been deeply influenced by almost all [[Languages of Italy|regional languages of Italy]] while its [[received pronunciation]] (known as ''Pronuncia Fiorentina Emendata'', Amended Florentine Pronunciation) is based on the [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] of [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]] ([[Rome|Roman dialect]]); these are the reasons why Standard Italian differs significantly from the [[Tuscan dialect]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/pronuncia_(Enciclopedia_dell'Italiano)/ La pronuncia italiana (Italian)]. treccani.it&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin===
[[Classical Latin]] was the literary standard dialect of Latin spoken by higher socioeconomic classes, as opposed to the [[Vulgar Latin]] which is the generic term of the colloquial [[sociolect]]s of Latin spoken across the [[Roman Empire]] by uneducated and less-educated classes. The Latin brought by Roman soldiers to [[Gaul]], [[Hispania|Iberia]], or [[Dacia]] was not identical to the Latin of [[Cicero]], and differed from it in vocabulary, syntax, and grammar.&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;L. R. Palmer The Latin Language (repr. Univ. Oklahoma 1988, {{ISBN|0-8061-2136-X}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portuguese===

In Brazil, actors and journalists usually adopt an unofficial, but de facto, spoken standard [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], originally derived from the middle-class dialect of [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro]], but that now encompasses educated urban pronunciations from the different speech communities in the southeast. In that standard, {{angbr|s}} represents the phoneme {{IPA|/s/}} when it appears at the end of a syllable (whereas in Rio de Janeiro this represents {{IPA|/ʃ/}}) the [[rhotic consonant]] spelled {{angbr|r}} is pronounced {{IPA|[h]}} in the same situation (whereas in [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]] this is usually an [[alveolar flap]] or [[alveolar trill|trill]]). European and African dialects have differing realizations of {{IPA|/ʁ/}} than Brazilian dialects, with the former using {{IPA|[ʁ]}} and {{IPA|[r]}} and the latter using {{IPA|[x]}}, {{IPA|[h]}}, or {{IPA|[χ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Mateus, Maria Helena &amp; d'Andrade, Ernesto (2000) ''The Phonology of Portuguese'' {{ISBN|0-19-823581-X}} [http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-823581-X.pdf (Excerpt from Google Books)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628065105/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-823581-X.pdf |date=2007-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serbo-Croatian===
Four standard variants of the [[Pluricentric language#Serbo-Croatian|pluricentric Serbo-Croatian]] are spoken in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |editor1-last=Madelain |editor1-first=Anne |title=Au sud de l'Est |series=vol. 3 |publisher=Non Lieu |pages=71–78 |language=French |chapter=La langue croate, serbe, bosniaque et monténégrine |trans-chapter=Croatian, Serbian, Bosniakian, and Montenegrin |chapterurl=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/429734.LA_LANGUE_CROATE_SERBE.PDF |deadurl=no |location=Paris |year=2007 |isbn=978-2-35270-036-4 |oclc=182916790 |archivedate=4 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69f5WqGAx?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/429734.LA_LANGUE_CROATE_SERBE.PDF |accessdate=8 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They all have the [[Language secessionism#In Serbo-Croatian|same dialect]] basis ([[Shtokavian dialect|Štokavian]]).&lt;ref name=Blum/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brozović |first=Dalibor |authorlink=Dalibor Brozović |editor1-last=Clyne |editor1-first=Michael G |title=Pluricentric Languages: Differing Norms in Different Nations |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter |pages=347–380 |chapter=Serbo-Croatian as a pluricentric language |chapterurl=https://books.google.hr/books?id=wawGFWNuHiwC&amp;pg=PA347&amp;lpg=PA347&amp;dq=serbo-croatian+pluricentric&amp;hl=hr#v=onepage&amp;q=serbo-croatian%20pluricentric&amp;f=false |series=Contributions to the sociology of language 62 |location=Berlin &amp; New York |year=1992 |oclc=24668375}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kristophson, Jürgen |title=Vom Widersinn der Dialektologie: Gedanken zum Štokavischen |trans-title=Dialectological Nonsense: Thoughts on Shtokavian |language=German |journal=Zeitschrift für Balkanologie |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=178–186 |year=2000 |issn=0044-2356 |id={{ZDB|201058-6}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; These variants do differ slightly, as is the case with other pluricentric languages&lt;ref name=Blum/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |editor1-last=Badurina |editor1-first=Lada |editor2-last=Pranjković |editor2-first=Ivo |editor2-link=Ivo Pranjković |editor3-last=Silić |editor3-first=Josip |title=Jezični varijeteti i nacionalni identiteti |publisher=Disput |pages=83–108 |language=Serbo-Croatian |chapter=Policentrični standardni jezik |trans-chapter=Polycentric Standard Language |chapterurl=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/426269.POLICENTRICNI_STANDARDNI.PDF |deadurl=no |location=Zagreb |year=2009 |isbn=978-953-260-054-4 |oclc=437306433 |archivedate=4 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69f5Mtzox?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/426269.POLICENTRICNI_STANDARDNI.PDF |accessdate=5 April 2013 |df= }} [http://data.onb.ac.at/rec/AC07252152 (ÖNB)].&lt;/ref&gt;, but not to a degree that would justify considering them as [[Language secessionism#In Serbo-Croatian|different languages]].

'''Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment''' ('''SELEX'''), also referred to as ''[[Deoxyribozyme#in vitro selection|in vitro selection]]'' or ''[[Deoxyribozyme#in vitro evolution|in vitro evolution]]'', is a [[combinatorial chemistry]] technique in [[molecular biology]] for producing [[oligonucleotide]]s of either single-stranded [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] that specifically bind to a target [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] or ligands, which are commonly referred to as [[aptamer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hak-Hagir A | title = [The Hak-Hagir skin conduit] | journal = Zeitschrift Fur Urologie Und Nephrologie | volume = 71 | issue = 9 | pages = 639–42 | date = September 1978 | pmc = 362762 | doi = 10.1128/mcb.9.7.2944 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tuerk C, Gold L | title = Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment: RNA ligands to bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase | journal = Science | volume = 249 | issue = 4968 | pages = 505–10 | date = August 1990 | pmid = 2200121 | doi = 10.1126/science.2200121 | bibcode = 1990Sci...249..505T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ellington AD, Szostak JW | title = In vitro selection of RNA molecules that bind specific ligands | journal = Nature | volume = 346 | issue = 6287 | pages = 818–22 | date = August 1990 | pmid = 1697402 | doi = 10.1038/346818a0 | bibcode = 1990Natur.346..818E }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although SELEX has emerged as the most commonly used name for the procedure, some researchers have referred to it as '''SAAB''' (selected and amplified binding site) and '''CASTing''' (cyclic amplification and selection of targets)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blackwell TK, Weintraub H | title = Differences and similarities in DNA-binding preferences of MyoD and E2A protein complexes revealed by binding site selection | journal = Science | volume = 250 | issue = 4984 | pages = 1104–10 | date = November 1990 | pmid = 2174572 | doi = 10.1126/science.2174572 | bibcode = 1990Sci...250.1104B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright WE, Binder M, Funk W | title = Cyclic amplification and selection of targets (CASTing) for the myogenin consensus binding site | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 4104–10 | date = August 1991 | pmid = 1649388 | doi = 10.1128/mcb.11.8.4104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SELEX was first introduced in 1990. In 2015 a special issue was published in the [[Journal of Molecular Evolution]] in the honor of quarter century of the SELEX discovery.

The process begins with the synthesis of a very large oligonucleotide library consisting of randomly generated sequences of fixed length flanked by constant [[5' end|5']] and [[3' end|3']] ends that serve as [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For a randomly generated region of length ''n'', the number of possible sequences in the library is 4&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; (''n'' positions with four possibilities (A,T,C,G) at each position). The sequences in the library are exposed to the target ligand - which may be a [[protein]] or a [[small organic compound]] - and those that do not bind the target are removed, usually by [[affinity chromatography]] or target capture on paramagnetic beads.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stoltenburg R, Schubert T, Strehlitz B | title = In vitro Selection and Interaction Studies of a DNA Aptamer Targeting Protein A | journal = PLOS One | volume = 10 | issue = 7 | pages = e0134403 | date = 2015-07-29 | pmid = 26221730 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0134403 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bound sequences are eluted and amplified by [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; to prepare for subsequent rounds of selection in which the stringency of the elution conditions can be increased to identify the tightest-binding sequences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A caution to consider in this method is that the selection of extremely high, sub-[[Nano-|nano]]molar binding affinity entities may not in fact improve specificity for the target molecule.&lt;ref name="Carothers"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carothers JM, Oestreich SC, Szostak JW | title = Aptamers selected for higher-affinity binding are not more specific for the target ligand | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 128 | issue = 24 | pages = 7929–37 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16771507 | pmc = 4287982 | doi = 10.1021/ja060952q }}&lt;/ref&gt; Off-target binding to related molecules could have significant clinical effects.

SELEX has been used to develop a number of aptamers that bind targets interesting for both clinical and research purposes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu YX, Kwon YJ | title = Aptamers: The "evolution" of SELEX | journal = Methods | volume = 106 | pages = 21–8 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27109056 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.04.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also towards these ends, a number of nucleotides with chemically modified sugars and bases have been incorporated into SELEX reactions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keefe AD, Cload ST | title = SELEX with modified nucleotides | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 448–56 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18644461 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.06.028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These modified nucleotides allow for the selection of aptamers with novel binding properties and potentially improved stability.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Procedure ==

=== Generating single stranded oligonucleotide library ===
The first step of SELEX involves the synthesis of fully or partially randomized oligonucleotide sequences of some length flanked by defined regions which allow PCR amplification of those randomized regions and, in the case of RNA SELEX, in vitro transcription of the randomized sequence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huizenga2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huizenga DE, Szostak JW | title = A DNA aptamer that binds adenosine and ATP | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 656–65 | date = January 1995 | pmid = 7819261 | doi = 10.1021/bi00002a033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Ellington and Szostak demonstrated that chemical synthesis is capable of generating ~10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; unique sequences for oligonucleotide libraries in their 1990 paper on in vitro selection,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; they found that amplification of these synthesized oligonucleotides led to significant loss of pool diversity due to PCR bias and defects in synthesized fragments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The oligonucleotide pool is amplified and a sufficient amount of the initial library is added to the reaction so that there are numerous copies of each individual sequence to minimize the loss of potential binding sequences due to stochastic events.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Before the library is introduced to target for incubation and selective retention, the sequence library must be converted to single stranded oligonucleotides to achieve structural conformations with target binding properties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Target incubation ===
Immediately prior to target introduction, the single stranded oligonucleotide library is often heated and cooled slowly to renature oligonucleotides into thermodynamically stable secondary and tertiary structures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Once prepared, the randomized library is incubated with immobilized target to allow oligonucleotide-target binding. There are several considerations for this target incubation step, including the target immobilization method and strategies for subsequent unbound oligonucleotide separation, incubation time and temperature, incubation buffer conditions, and target versus oligonucleotide concentrations. Examples of target immobilization methods include [[affinity chromatography]] columns,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; nitrocellulose [[Filter binding assay|binding assay filters,]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and [[Dynabeads|paramagnetic beads.]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Recently, SELEX reactions have been developed where the target is whole cells, which are expanded near complete [[Confluency|confluence]] and incubated with the oligonucleotide library on culture plates.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iwagawa T, Ohuchi SP, Watanabe S, Nakamura Y | title = Selection of RNA aptamers against mouse embryonic stem cells | journal = Biochimie | volume = 94 | issue = 1 | pages = 250–7 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22085640 | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2011.10.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Incubation buffer conditions are altered based on the intended target and desired function of the selected aptamer. For example, in the case of negatively charged small molecules and proteins, high salt buffers are used for [[Electric-field screening|charge screening]] to allow nucleotides to approach the target and increase the chance of a specific binding event.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Alternatively, if the desired aptamer function is in vivo protein or whole cell binding for potential therapeutic or diagnostic application, incubation buffer conditions similar to in vivo plasma salt concentrations and homeostatic temperatures are more likely to generate aptamers that can bind in vivo. Another consideration in incubation buffer conditions is non-specific competitors. If there is a high likelihood of non-specific oligonucleotide retention in the reaction conditions, non specific competitors, which are small molecules or polymers other than the SELEX library that have similar physical properties to the library oligonucleotides, can be used to occupy these non-specific binding sites.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Varying the relative concentration of target and oligonucleotides can also affect properties of the selected aptamers. If a good [[binding affinity]] for the selected aptamer is not a concern, then an excess of target can be used to increase the probability that at least some sequences will bind during incubation and be retained. However, this provides no selective pressure for high [[Ligand (biochemistry)|binding affinity]], which requires the oligonucleotide library to be in excess so that there is competition between unique sequences for available specific binding sites.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Binding sequence elution and amplification ===
Once the oligonucleotide library has been incubated with target for sufficient time, unbound oligonucleotides are washed away from immobilized target, often using the incubation buffer so that specifically bound oligonucleotides are retained.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With unbound sequences washed away, the specifically bound sequences are then eluted by creating denaturing conditions that promote oligonucleotide unfolding or loss of binding conformation including flowing in deionized water,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; using denaturing solutions containing urea and EDTA,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vater A, Jarosch F, Buchner K, Klussmann S | title = Short bioactive Spiegelmers to migraine-associated calcitonin gene-related peptide rapidly identified by a novel approach: tailored-SELEX | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 31 | issue = 21 | pages = e130 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14576330 | pmc = 275487 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gng130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by applying high heat and physical force.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Upon elution of bound sequences, the retained oligonucleotides are [[Reverse transcriptase|reverse-transcribed]] to DNA in the case of RNA or modified base selections,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; or simply collected for amplification in the case of DNA SELEX.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blank M, Weinschenk T, Priemer M, Schluesener H | title = Systematic evolution of a DNA aptamer binding to rat brain tumor microvessels. selective targeting of endothelial regulatory protein pigpen | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 276 | issue = 19 | pages = 16464–8 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11279054 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M100347200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These DNA templates from eluted sequences are then amplified via [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] and converted to single stranded DNA, RNA, or modified base oligonucleotides, which are used as the initial input for the next round of selection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Obtaining ssDNA===
One of the most critical steps in the SELEX procedure is obtaining single stranded DNA (ssDNA) after the PCR amplification step. This will serve as input for the next cycle so it is of vital importance that all the DNA is single stranded and as little as possible is lost. Because of the relative simplicity, one of the most used methods is using biotinylated reverse primers in the amplification step, after which the complementary strands can be bound to a resin followed by elution of the other strand with lye. Another method is asymmetric PCR, where the amplification step is performed with an excess of forward primer and very little reverse primer, which leads to the production of more of the desired strand. A drawback of this method is that the product should be purified from double stranded DNA (dsDNA) and other left-over material from the PCR reaction. Enzymatic degradation of the unwanted strand can be performed by tagging this strand using a phosphate-probed primer, as it is recognized by enzymes such as [[Exodeoxyribonuclease|Lambda exonuclease]]. These enzymes then selectively degrade the phosphate tagged strand leaving the complementary strand intact. All of these methods recover approximately 50 to 70% of the DNA. For a detailed comparison refer to the article by Svobodová et al. where these, and other, methods are experimentally compared.&lt;ref name="Svobodová"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Svobodová M, Pinto A, Nadal P, O' Sullivan CK | title = Comparison of different methods for generation of single-stranded DNA for SELEX processes | journal = Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry | volume = 404 | issue = 3 | pages = 835–42 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22733247 | doi = 10.1007/s00216-012-6183-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In classical SELEX, the process of randomized single stranded library generation, target incubation, and binding sequence elution and amplification described above are repeated until the vast majority of the retained pool consists of target binding sequences,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; though there are modifications and additions to the procedure that are often used, which are discussed below.

=== Negative or counter selection ===
In order to increase the specificity of aptamers selected by a given SELEX procedure, a negative selection, or counter selection, step can be added prior to or immediately following target incubation. To eliminate sequences with affinity for target immobilization matrix components from the pool, negative selection can be used where the library is incubated with target immobilization matrix components and unbound sequences are retained.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stoltenburg R, Reinemann C, Strehlitz B | title = SELEX--a (r)evolutionary method to generate high-affinity nucleic acid ligands | journal = Biomolecular Engineering | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 381–403 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17627883 | doi = 10.1016/j.bioeng.2007.06.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Negative selection can also be used to eliminate sequences that bind target-like molecules or cells by incubating the oligonucleotide library with small molecule target analogs, undesired cell types, or non-target proteins and retaining the unbound sequences.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haller AA, Sarnow P | title = In vitro selection of a 7-methyl-guanosine binding RNA that inhibits translation of capped mRNA molecules | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 94 | issue = 16 | pages = 8521–6 | date = August 1997 | pmid = 9238009 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.16.8521 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tracking selection progression ===
To track the progress of a SELEX reaction, the number of target bound molecules, which is equivalent to the number of oligonucleotides eluted, can be compared to the estimated total input of oligonucleotides following elution at each round.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sefah K, Shangguan D, Xiong X, O'Donoghue MB, Tan W | title = Development of DNA aptamers using Cell-SELEX | language = En | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 1169–85 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20539292 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2010.66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of eluted oligonucleotides can be estimated through elution concentration estimations via 260&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength absorbance&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; or fluorescent labeling of oligonucleotides.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As the SELEX reaction approaches completion, the fraction of the oligonucleotide library that binds target approaches 100%, such that the number of eluted molecules approaches the total oligonucleotide input estimate, but may converge at a lower number.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Caveats and considerations ===
Some SELEX reactions can generate probes that are dependent on primer binding regions for secondary structure formation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There are aptamer applications for which a short sequence, and thus primer truncation, is desirable.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lubin AA, Hunt BV, White RJ, Plaxco KW | title = Effects of probe length, probe geometry, and redox-tag placement on the performance of the electrochemical E-DNA sensor | language = EN | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 81 | issue = 6 | pages = 2150–8 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19215066 | doi = 10.1021/ac802317k }}&lt;/ref&gt; An advancement on the original method allows an RNA library to omit the constant primer regions, which can be difficult to remove after the selection process because they stabilize [[secondary structure]]s that are unstable when formed by the random region alone.&lt;ref name="Jarosch2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jarosch F, Buchner K, Klussmann S | title = In vitro selection using a dual RNA library that allows primerless selection | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 34 | issue = 12 | pages = e86 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16855281 | pmc = 1524915 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl463 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemically modified nucleotides ==
Recently, SELEX has expanded to include the use of chemically modified nucleotides. These chemically modified oligonucleotides offer many potential advantages for selected aptamers including greater stability and nuclease resistance, enhanced binding for select targets, expanded physical properties - like increased hydrophobicity, and more diverse structural conformations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pinheiro VB, Taylor AI, Cozens C, Abramov M, Renders M, Zhang S, Chaput JC, Wengel J, Peak-Chew SY, McLaughlin SH, Herdewijn P, Holliger P | title = Synthetic genetic polymers capable of heredity and evolution | journal = Science | volume = 336 | issue = 6079 | pages = 341–4 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22517858 | pmc = 3362463 | doi = 10.1126/science.1217622 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genetic alphabet, and thus possible aptamers, is also expanded using unnatural base pairs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kimoto M, Kawai R, Mitsui T, Yokoyama S, Hirao I | title = An unnatural base pair system for efficient PCR amplification and functionalization of DNA molecules | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = e14 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19073696 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkn956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamashige R, Kimoto M, Takezawa Y, Sato A, Mitsui T, Yokoyama S, Hirao I | title = Highly specific unnatural base pair systems as a third base pair for PCR amplification | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 40 | issue = 6 | pages = 2793–806 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22121213 | pmc = 3315302 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkr1068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the use of these unnatural base pairs was applied to SELEX and high affinity DNA aptamers were generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kimoto M, Yamashige R, Matsunaga K, Yokoyama S, Hirao I | title = Generation of high-affinity DNA aptamers using an expanded genetic alphabet | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 453–7 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23563318 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2556 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9233">'''The Void''' is the [[philosophical]] concept of [[nothingness]] manifested. The notion of the Void is relevant to several realms of [[metaphysics]]. The Void is also prevalent in numerous facets of [[psychology]], notably [[logotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1969-17592-001 |accessdate=August 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402152855/http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1969-17592-001 |archivedate=April 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manifestation of nothingness is closely associated with the contemplation of [[emptiness]], and with human attempts to identify and personify it. As such, the concept of the Void, and ideas similar to it, have a significant and historically evolving presence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahalmaas.com/Extracts/void.htm |title=The Void - Nature of Mind |publisher=Ahalmaas.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; in artistic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1992.5112 |title=Yves Klein, Harry Shunk, Janos Kender: Leap into the Void (1992.5112) &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=2012-10-24 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and creative expression, as well as in academic, scientific and philosophical debate surrounding the nature of the [[human condition]].

In this sense, knowledge or experience of the Void could be said to actually be [[The Cloud of Unknowing|unknowing]], given its inherent [[ineffability]]. In Western mystical traditions, it was often argued that the transcendent 'Ground of Being' could therefore be approached through aphairesis, a form of negation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morley|first1=Simon|title=The Sublime Unknown|url=https://www.academia.edu/2312305/The_Sublime_Unknown|website=academia.edu|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

Western philosophers have discussed the existence and nature of void since [[Parmenides]] suggested it did not exist and used this to argue for the non-existence of change, motion, differentiation, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diels–Kranz numbering system|DK]] fragment B 8.5–6, 8.22–24.&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to Parmenides, [[Democritus]] described the universe as only being composed of atoms and void.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laërtius]] ix.72.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]], in Book IV of ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', denied the existence of the Void ({{lang-el|κενόν}}) with his rejection of finite entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath526/kmath526.htm |title=Continuity and the Void |publisher=Mathpages.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were questions as to whether void was truly nothing or if it was in fact filled with other things, with theories of [[Aether theories|aether]] being suggested in the 18th century to fill the void.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac Newton]], The Third Book of ''[[Opticks]]'' (1718).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mysticism==
{{Refimprove|date=October 2016}}

[[Peter Matthiessen]] in ''[[The Snow Leopard]]'' (1978) described an experience of sitting on rocks in the Himalayas as leading to an awareness of a Void at the centre, or the source, of phenomenal existence: "These hard rocks instruct my bones in what my brain could never grasp in the Heart Sutra, that 'form is emptiness and emptiness is form' – the Void, the emptiness of blue-black space, contained in everything."

For [[Ken Wilber]] in ''Spectrum of Consciousness'' (1977), the Void is not mere nothingness, and is therefore distinct from something that can be subsumed into the category of nihilism, and is instead "reality before we slice it up into conceptualism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilber|first1=Ken|title=The Spectrum of Consciousness|date=2002|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=8120818482|page=59|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NIhCMFW5wFAC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=%22the+Void%22+sunyata&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5bizelpLAV&amp;sig=Gm3nAAteUOGYg2N2bo9MXcp05PU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zbymU72hDrD60gX7uoA4&amp;ved=0CGsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20Void%22%20&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here he explores the idea of [[Śūnyatā]], which cannot be "called void or not void; or both or neither" but can be referred to as 'the Void' with, again, the proviso that it exists beyond the limit of language.

[[Stanislav Grof]]'s distinction between holotropic and hylotropic experience is important here, with the former encapsulating experiences which connect to the Void.

The Void is also an important concept in martial arts such as [[Aikido]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matthews|first1=Niall|title=Emptiness, Space, Ma ai, Irimi, and the True Void|url=http://www.aikiweb.com/forums/showthread.php?t=21552|website=AikiWeb|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Particle physics==
[[Atomic physics]], according to [[Paul Brunton]], has proven that the world "derives from a mysterious No-thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wisdomsgoldenrod.org/notebooks/para/24203 |title=Para #24203 - Notebooks of Paul Brunton |publisher=Wisdomsgoldenrod.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar line of argument is explored in ''The Void'' (2007) by [[Frank Close]], who discusses the concept of 'empty space' from [[Aristotle]] through to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Ernst Mach|Mach]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] and beyond (including the idea of an 'aether' and current examinations of the [[Higgs field]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Close|first1=Frank|title=The Void|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oabrCbbMx6oC&amp;dq=%22the+void%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|website=Google Books|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another perspective on the matter from a scientific angle is the work of the physicist [[Lawrence Krauss]], particularly his 2012 book ''[[A Universe from Nothing]]'', in which he explores the idea of the universe having been derived from a [[Quantum Vacuum|quantum vacuum]] (which may or may not be the same as a philosophical concept of the nothingness of the Void, depending on how it is defined). A further consideration is the enigmatic nature of [[dark energy]] which may be seen as coterminous with the Void.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Ethan Siegel|last1=Siegel|first1=Ethan|title=Empty space has more energy than everything in the Universe, combined|url=http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2012/07/26/empty-space-has-more-energy-than-everything-in-the-universe-combined/|website=Science Blogs|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His work has received sustained criticism from [[David Albert]] and others working in both philosophy and physics.

However, Supreme Court Justice Hugh O'Flaherty, now retired, said in an interview with the ''Irish Times'' that the X Case was "peculiar to its own particular facts", since X miscarried and did not have an abortion, and this renders the case moot in Irish law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=X Case judge says ruling is 'moot' in current abortion debate|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/x-case-judge-says-ruling-is-moot-in-current-abortion-debate-1.1454699|publisher=Irish Times|date=6 July 2013|author=Ruadhan Mac Cormaic}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See below events in 2012/2013).

* 2003 – The U.S. enacted the ''[[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]]'' and [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] signed it into law.  After the law was challenged in three appeals courts, the U.S. Supreme Court held that it was constitutional because, unlike the earlier Nebraska state law, it was not vague or overly broad.

The Act gave effect in statutory law to the terms of the Constitution of Ireland as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the 1992 judgment ''[[Attorney General v. X]]'' (the "X case").

* 2018 - ''[[National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v.

The law required that licensed centers post visible notices that other options for pregnancy, including abortion, are available from state-sponsored clinics. It also mandated that unlicensed centers post notice of their unlicensed status. The centers, typically run by Christian non-profit groups, challenged the act on the basis that it violated their free speech. After prior reviews in lower courts, the case was brought to the Supreme Court, asking "Whether the disclosures required by the California Reproductive FACT Act violate the protections set forth in the free speech clause of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], applicable to the states through the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/national-institute-family-life-advocates-v-becerra/ National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v.

'''Truth claim''', in photography, is a term [[Tom Gunning]] uses to describe the prevalent belief that traditional photographs accurately depict reality. He states that the truth claim relies on both the [[indexicality]] and visual accuracy of photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gunning|2004|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indexicality==
[[Charles Peirce]]'s term 'indexicality' refers to the physical relationship between the object photographed and the resulting image.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gunning|2004|pp=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Levinson]] emphasises the ability of photography to capture or reflect "a literal energy configuration from the real world" through a chemical process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levinson|1997|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Light sensitive emulsion on the [[Negative (photography)|photographic negative]] is transformed by light passing [[Through-the-lens|through the lens]] and diaphragm of a camera.&lt;ref name="Gunning_40"&gt;{{harvp|Gunning|2004|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levinson relates this characteristic of the photograph to its objectivity and reliability, echoing Andre Bazin's belief that photography is free from the "sin" of subjectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levinson|1997|pp=40, 41, 47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar argument has been made for motion pictures by Stephen Maguire. [[Lev Manovich]] labels cinema ''the art of the index'', its traditional identity lying in its ability to capture reality.&lt;ref name="Manovich"&gt;{{cite web |author=Lev Manovich |title=What is digital cinema? |url=http://www.manovich.net/text/digital-cinema |year=1995 |accessdate=1 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denis McQuail]] likewise argues that film is capable of manipulating the "...seeming reality of the photographic message without loss of credibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McQuail|2000|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual accuracy==
Gunning states that a photograph must also have "iconicity". To represent "truth" it must resemble the object it represents, which is not an inevitable characteristic of an index.&lt;ref name="Gunning_40"/&gt;

==Consequences of the "truth claim"==

===For individuals===
Levinson suggests that icons have a powerful effect on individuals, particularly the "direct image" due to the "sheer ease and [[sensual]] satisfaction" of viewing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levinson|1997|pp=37, 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunning attributes the human fascination with photographs with a sense of the relationship between photography and reality, though he claims that the "perceptual richness and nearly infinite detail" of the image itself is more significant than a knowledge of its indexicality. He cites Bazin's idea that photography has an "irrational power to bear away our [[faith]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gunning|2004|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, [[Susan Sontag]] relates the belief in a photograph's ability to capture 'reality' to the development of certain human practices. Since a picture confers on events "a kind of immortality (and importance) it would never otherwise have enjoyed,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; she explains, the act of taking photographs has become essential to the experience of [[Travel|world travel]]. The possibility of 'true' photographs leads to a compulsion to "[convert] experience into an image" to "make real what one is experiencing."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For society===

====Understanding of reality====
David Croteau and William Hoynes suggest that the prevalence of photographic images has blurred the distinction between image and reality, referring to ''pseudo-events'', in Daniel Boorstin's words – such as [[News conference|press conferences]], televised political debates, or 'photo opportunities' - that exist only to create images.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Croteau|Hoynes|2003|pp=309–310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, [[Neil Postman]] argues that the photograph has redefined society's understanding of information and truth: "Truth is in the seeing, not in the thinking."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Croteau|Hoynes|2003|p=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postman suggests that the proliferation of photography led to the replacement of language with images as "our dominant means for constructing, understanding, and testing reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Postman|1993|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sontag shares this view, suggesting that "the 'realistic' view of the world compatible with bureaucracy redefines knowledge as ''techniques of information''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social organisation====
In Sontag's view, a consequence of photography becoming a primary means for understanding reality is the emergence of "[[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] cataloguing". She claims that photography's perceived ability to give information results in the bureaucratic organization of modern states. Institutions of control, such as the police, are able to survey and control "increasingly mobile populations" through photographic documents, such as passports or identity cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|pp=5, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Desensitization====
Sontag also argues that through repeatedly capturing and viewing reality through photographs, their subjects can become less real. She claims that "aesthetic distance seems built into the very experience of looking at photographs," and also that the sheer volume of horrific images throughout the world has produced a "familiarity with atrocity, making the horrible seem more ordinary – making it appear familiar, remote … inevitable".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hyperreality====
Sontag's view is akin to Jean Baudrillard's theory of 'hyperreality', where "reality itself founders" as a result of an endless "reduplication of the real" via media such as photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Baudrillard|2001|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that the possibility of infinite identical objects creates a "relationship of equivalence, of indifference,"...leading to the "extinction of the original."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Baudrillard|2001|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital photography==

It has been argued that the digitisation of photography undermines its ''truth claim''.

===Potential for manipulation===
Levinson suggests that the digitisation of photography undermines "the very reliability of the photograph as mute, unbiased witness of reality"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levinson|1997|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the fallibility of [[photo manipulation|technological manipulation]] and the potential for human refinement of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levinson|1997|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lev Manovich likewise questions the indexical identity of motion pictures, rather labelling cinema a [[Genre|subgenre]] of painting, since it is possible to digitally modify frames, generate photorealistic images entirely using 3-D [[computer animation]], and "...to cut, bend, stretch and stitch digitised film images into something which has perfect photographic credibility, although it was never actually filmed."&lt;ref name="Manovich"/&gt;

===Loss of indexicality===
It has also been argued that digital photographs inevitably lack indexicality, based on an understanding of "crucial distinctions between the analogue and the digital" in the way they record 'reality'.&lt;ref name="Lister_252"&gt;{{harvp|Lister|2007|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Frosh describes photographs as "codes without a message" – "repurposable visual content made of malleable info-pixels."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lister|2007|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The continuing "reality effect"===
Gunning alternatively argues that [[digital photography]], the process of encoding data about light in a matrix of numbers, is indexically determined by objects outside of the camera like chemical photography.&lt;ref name="Gunning_40"/&gt;

Likewise, Martin Lister claims that even with a [[digital camera]], "The images produced are rendered [[Photorealism|photo-realistic]], they borrow photography's currency, its deeply historical 'reality effect', simply in order to have meaning."&lt;ref name="Lister_252"/&gt;

==Criticism of the "truth claim"==
[[Susan Sontag]] challenges the "presumption of veracity" associated with photographs, arguing that they are "...as much an interpretation of the world as paintings and drawings are." She describes the role of the photographer in determining the exposure, light, texture and geometry of a photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunning points to the physicality of the camera as a mediator between the photograph and reality. He notes that the use of a lens, film, a particular exposure, kind of shutter, and developing process "...become magically whisked away if one considers the photograph as a direct imprint of reality."&lt;ref name="Gunning_40"/&gt;

Sontag also describes the inability of a photograph to capture enough information about its subject to be considered a representation of reality. She states, "The camera's rendering of reality must always hide more than it discloses…only what which narrates can make us understand."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, [[Roland Barthes]] notes that the [[Research subject|human subject]] can be made less real through the process of being photographed. He notes, "Once I feel myself observed by the lens, everything changes: I constitute myself in the process of 'posing', I instantaneously make another body for myself, transform myself in advance into an image."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Barthes|1982|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Porter|Kennedy|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''White Paper of 1939'''&lt;ref group=note&gt;Occasionally also known as the '''MacDonald White Paper''' (e.g. Caplan, 2015, p.117) after [[Malcolm MacDonald]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]] who presided over its creation.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[White paper|policy paper]] issued by the [[British government]] under [[Neville Chamberlain]] in response to the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936–39 Arab Revolt]]. Following its formal approval in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 23 May 1939,&lt;ref&gt;Hansard, [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1939/may/22/palestine-1 HC Deb 22 May 1939 vol 347 cc1937-2056] and [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1939/may/23/palestine HC Deb 23 May 1939 vol 347 cc2129-97]; "Resolved, That this House approves the policy of His Majesty's Government relating to Palestine as set out in Command Paper No. 6019."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;by 268 votes to 179.&lt;/ref&gt; it acted as the governing policy for [[Mandatory Palestine]] from 1939 until the British departure in 1948, the matter of the Mandate meanwhile [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|having been referred to the United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Hansard, [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1947/feb/18/palestine-conference-government-policy HC Deb 18 February 1947 vol 433 cc985-94]: "We have, therefore, reached the conclusion that the only course now open to us is to submit the problem to the judgment of the United Nations ... &lt;br&gt;[[Barnett Janner, Baron Janner|Mr. Janner]] Pending the remitting of this question to the United Nations, are we to understand that the Mandate stands. and that we shall deal with the situation of immigration and land restrictions on the basis of the terms of the Mandate, and that the White Paper of 1939 will be abolished? ... &lt;br&gt;[[Ernest Bevin|Mr. Bevin]] No, Sir. We have not found a substitute yet for that White Paper, and up to the moment, whether it is right or wrong, the House is committed to it. That is the legal position. We did, by arrangement and agreement, extend the period of immigration which would have terminated in December, 1945. Whether there will be any further change, my right hon. Friend the Colonial Secretary, who, of course, is responsible for the administration of the policy, will be considering later."&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy, first drafted in March 1939, was prepared by the British government unilaterally as a result of the failure of the Arab-Zionist [[London Conference (1939)|London Conference]].{{sfn|Caplan|2015|p=114|ps=: "As it had been made clear from the start, the absence of agreement at the St James's Conference meant that the British were left, after March 17th 1939, to finalise and to enforce their new Palestine policy unilaterally. A White Paper, first drafted in late March, was not published until early May, thus affording Arabs and Jews further opportunities to continue their efforts at influencing the final terms of the proposed British policy."}} The paper called for the establishment of a Jewish national home in an independent Palestinian state within 10 years, rejecting the [[Peel Commission|idea of partitioning]] [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].  It also limited Jewish immigration to 75,000 for 5 years, and ruled that further immigration was to be determined by the Arab majority (section II).  Restrictions were put on the rights of Jews to buy land from Arabs (section III).

The proposal did not meet the political demands proposed by Arab representatives during the [[London Conference (1939)|London Conference]] and was officially rejected by the representatives of Palestine Arab parties acting under the influence of [[Haj Amin Husseini|Haj Amin Eff el Husseini]] while more moderate Arab opinion represented in the National Defence Party was prepared to accept the White Paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Official Records of the Second Session of the General Assembly|title=United Nations Special Committee on Palestine 1947| publisher=United Nations|url=https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/07175DE9FA2DE563852568D3006E10F3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zionist groups in Palestine immediately rejected the White Paper. There was a campaign of attacks on government property, which lasted for several months. On 18 May a Jewish general strike was called.&lt;ref name="Inquiry. p.54"&gt;''A Survey of Palestine - prepared in December 1945 and January 1946 for the information of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry.''

Regulations governing land transfers and clauses relating to immigration were implemented although at the end of the five-year period in 1944, only 51,000 of the 75,000 immigration certificates provided for had been utilized. In circumstances where Jewish refugees from Europe were fleeing violence and persecution, the White Paper's limits were relaxed and legal immigration was permitted to continue indefinitely at the rate of 18,000 a year.&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;Study (30 June 1978): [https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/AEAC80E740C782E4852561150071FDB0 The Origins and Evolution of the Palestine Problem Part I: 1917-1947 - Study (30 June 1978)], accessdate: November 10, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Key provisions were ultimately never to be implemented, initially because of cabinet opposition following the change in government, and later because of preoccupation with World War II.{{sfn|Khalaf|1991|p=66|ps=: "The White Paper was never to be implemented, initially because of Cabinet opposition and then because of preoccupation with the war effort. However, 1939 and the first two years of the war saw a quiet, low key dialogue between the government and Palestinians who were ready to accept the White Paper. But the government's intention was to keep the Arabs placated, encourage the moderates, and continue to talk but promise very little, particularly on the constitutional provisions contained in the White Paper."}}

During [[World War I]], the British had made two promises regarding territory in the [[Middle East]]. Britain had promised the [[Hashemite]] governors of [[Arabia]], through [[T. E. Lawrence|Lawrence of Arabia]] and the [[Hussein-McMahon Correspondence]], independence for a united Arab country covering [[Syria]] in exchange for their supporting the British against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottoman Caliphate had declared a military [[jihad]] in support of the Germans and it was hoped that an alliance with the Arabs would quell the chances of a general Muslim uprising in British-held territories in Africa, India, and the Far East.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n706ShSYt-sC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=&amp;ei=VaM7SeidLKPCM-2J5L8D&amp;client=#PPA54,M1 King Husain and the Kingdom of Hejaz, Randall Baker, Oleander Press, 1979], {{ISBN|0-900891-48-3}}, page 54&lt;/ref&gt; Great Britain had also negotiated the [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]], agreeing to partition the Middle East between Britain and [[France]].

A variety of strategic factors, such as securing Jewish support in Eastern Europe as the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Russian front]] collapsed, culminated in the [[Balfour Declaration, 1917]], with Britain promising to create and foster a Jewish national home in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. These broad delineations of territory and goals for both the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, and Arab self-determination was approved in the [[San Remo conference]].

In June 1922 the [[League of Nations]] approved the Palestine Mandate with effect from September 1923. The Palestine Mandate was an explicit document regarding Britain's responsibilities and powers of administration in Palestine including 'secur[ing] the establishment of the Jewish national home', and 'safeguarding the civil and religious rights of all the inhabitants of Palestine'. In September 1922, the British government [[Transjordan memorandum|presented a memorandum]] to the League of Nations stating that [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] would be excluded from all the provisions dealing with Jewish settlement, in accordance with Article 25 of the Mandate, and this memorandum was approved on 23 September. Due to stiff Arab opposition and pressure against Jewish immigration, Britain redefined Jewish immigration by restricting its flow according to the country's economic capacity to absorb the immigrants. In effect annual quotas were put in place as to how many Jews could immigrate, while Jews possessing a large sum of money (£500) were allowed to enter the country freely.

Following [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power]], a growing number of European Jews were prepared to spend the money necessary to enter Palestine. The 1935 [[Nuremberg Laws]] stripped the 500,000 German Jews of their citizenship. Jewish migration was impeded by Nazi restrictions on the transfer of finances abroad (departing Jews had to abandon their property), but the [[Jewish Agency]] was able to negotiate an agreement allowing Jews resident in Germany to buy German goods for export to Palestine thus circumventing the restrictions.

The large numbers of Jews entering Palestine{{Elucidate|reason=The reason for the Arab revolt were Economical, Political and Social. The mostly Jewish immigration from Europe aggravated those problems by bringing progress, but wasn't the sole reason for it|date=January 2014}} led to the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]]. Britain responded to the Arab revolt by appointing a [[Royal Commission]], known as the [[Peel Commission]] which traveled out to Palestine and undertook a thorough study of the issues. The Peel Commission recommended in 1937 that Palestine be partitioned into two states, one Arab the other Jewish. In January 1938, the [[Woodhead Commission]] explored the practicalities of partition. The Woodhead Commission considered three different plans, one of which was based on the Peel plan. Reporting in 1938, the Commission rejected the Peel plan primarily on the grounds that it could not be implemented without a massive forced transfer of Arabs (an option that the British government had already ruled out).&lt;ref name="WoodheadReport1938"&gt;{{cite web|title=Woodhead commission report |url=https://archive.org/details/WoodheadCommission}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With dissent from some of its members, the Commission instead recommended a plan that would leave the Galilee under British mandate, but emphasised serious problems with it that included a lack of financial self-sufficiency of the proposed Arab State.&lt;ref name="WoodheadReport1938"/&gt; The British Government accompanied the publication of the Woodhead Report by a statement of policy rejecting partition as impracticable due to "political, administrative and financial difficulties".&lt;ref&gt;Statement by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, Presented by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to Parliament by Command of His Majesty November, 1938. {{cite web|url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/4941922311B4E3C585256D17004BD2E2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103061306/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/4941922311B4E3C585256D17004BD2E2 |archivedate=2013-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposed a substantially smaller Jewish state, including the coastal plain only. An [[Évian Conference|international conference]] (Évian Conference) convened by the United States in July 1938, failed to find any agreement to deal with the rapidly growing number of Jewish refugees.

===London Conference===
{{main|London Conference (1939)}}
In February 1939 the British called the [[London Conference (1939)|London Conference]] to negotiate an agreement between Arabs and Jews in Palestine. The Arab delegates attended on condition that they would not meet directly with the Jewish representatives, which would constitute recognition of Jewish claims over Palestine. So the British government held separate meetings with the two sides. The conference ended in failure on March 17.&lt;ref name="avalon.law.yale.edu"&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/angap04.asp Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry - Appendix IV] Palestine: Historical Background&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of World War II, the British believed that Jewish support was guaranteed or unimportant. However they feared that the Arab world might turn against them. This geopolitical consideration was, in [[Raul Hilberg]]'s word, "decisive"&lt;ref&gt;[[Raul Hilberg|Hilberg, Raul]], ''The Destruction of the European Jews'', (1961) New Viewpoints, New York 1973 p.716&lt;/ref&gt; to British policies. [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] were independent and allied with Britain.

==Content==
[[File:WhitePaper.jpg|thumb|Land classification and boundaries of land transfer regions as prescribed in 1940.]]
The main points of the White Paper were:
*'''Section I. The Constitution''': It stated that with over 450,000 Jews having now settled in the mandate, the Balfour Declaration about "a national home for the Jewish people" had been met and called for an independent Palestine established within 10 years, governed jointly by Arabs and Jews:

&lt;blockquote&gt;His Majesty's Government believe that the framers of the Mandate in which the Balfour Declaration was embodied could not have intended that Palestine should be converted into a Jewish State against the will of the Arab population of the country. [ ... ] His Majesty's Government therefore now declare unequivocally that it is not part of their policy that Palestine should become a Jewish State. They would indeed regard it as contrary to their obligations to the Arabs under the Mandate, as well as to the assurances which have been given to the Arab people in the past, that the Arab population of Palestine should be made the subjects of a Jewish State against their will.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The objective of His Majesty's Government is the establishment within 10 years of an independent Palestine State in such treaty relations with the United Kingdom as will provide satisfactorily for the commercial and strategic requirements of both countries in the future. [..] The independent State should be one in which Arabs and Jews share government in such a way as to ensure that the essential interests of each community are safeguarded.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*'''Section II. Immigration''': Jewish immigration to Palestine under the British Mandate was to be limited to 75,000 over the next five years, after which it would depend on Arab consent:

&lt;blockquote&gt;His Majesty's Government do not [..] find anything in the Mandate or in subsequent Statements of Policy to support the view that the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine cannot be effected unless immigration is allowed to continue indefinitely. If immigration has an adverse effect on the economic position in the country, it should clearly be restricted; and equally, if it has a seriously damaging effect on the political position in the country, that is a factor that should not be ignored. Although it is not difficult to contend that the large number of Jewish immigrants who have been admitted so far have been absorbed economically, the fear of the Arabs that this influx will continue indefinitely until the Jewish population is in a position to dominate them has produced consequences which are extremely grave for Jews and Arabs alike and for the peace and prosperity of Palestine. The lamentable disturbances of the past three years are only the latest and most sustained manifestation of this intense Arab apprehension [ ... ] it cannot be denied that fear of indefinite Jewish immigration is widespread amongst the Arab population and that this fear has made possible disturbances which have given a serious setback to economic progress, depleted the Palestine exchequer, rendered life and property insecure, and produced a bitterness between the Arab and Jewish populations which is deplorable between citizens of the same country. If in these circumstances immigration is continued up to the economic absorptive capacity of the country, regardless of all other considerations, a fatal enmity between the two peoples will be perpetuated, and the situation in Palestine may become a permanent source of friction amongst all peoples in the Near and Middle East.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jewish immigration during the next five years will be at a rate which, if economic absorptive capacity permits, will bring the Jewish population up to approximately one third of the total population of the country. Taking into account the expected natural increase of the Arab and Jewish populations, and the number of illegal Jewish immigrants now in the country, this would allow of the admission, as from the beginning of April this year, of some 75,000 immigrants over the next four years. These immigrants would, subject to the criterion of economic absorptive capacity, be admitted as follows: For each of the next five years a quota of 10,000 Jewish immigrants will be allowed on the understanding that a shortage one year may be added to the quotas for subsequent years, within the five-year period, if economic absorptive capacity permits. In addition, as a contribution towards the solution of the Jewish refugee problem, 25,000 refugees will be admitted as soon as the [[High Commissioner]] is satisfied that adequate provision for their maintenance is ensured, special consideration being given to refugee children and dependents. The existing machinery for ascertaining economic absorptive capacity will be retained, and the High Commissioner will have the ultimate responsibility for deciding the limits of economic capacity. Before each periodic decision is taken, Jewish and Arab representatives will be consulted. After the period of five years, no further Jewish immigration will be permitted unless the Arabs of Palestine are prepared to acquiesce in it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*'''Section III. Land''': Previously no restriction had been imposed on the transfer of land from Arabs to Jews, while now the ''White Paper'' stated: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Reports of several expert Commissions have indicated that, owing to the natural growth of the Arab population and the steady sale in recent years of Arab land to Jews, there is now in certain areas no room for further transfers of Arab land, whilst in some other areas such transfers of land must be restricted if Arab cultivators are to maintain their existing standard of life and a considerable landless Arab population is not soon to be created. In these circumstances, the High Commissioner will be given general powers to prohibit and regulate transfers of land.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Parliamentary Approval===
On 22 May 1939 the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] debated a motion that the White Paper was inconsistent with the terms of the Mandate. It was defeated by 268 votes to 179. The following day the [[House of Lords]] accepted the new policy without a vote.&lt;ref&gt;''A Survey of Palestine - prepared in December 1945 and January 1946 for the information of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry.'' Reprinted 1991 by The Institute of Palestine Studies, Washington. Volume one. {{ISBN|0-88728-211-3}}. p.54.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the debate, [[Lloyd George]] called the White Paper an "act of perfidy" while [[Winston Churchill]] voted against the government of his party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Manchester Guardian |title = The Broadcast Debate: "An Act of Perfidy" Mr. Lloyd George's Attack On Plan | date=24 May 1939 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[James Armand de Rothschild|James Rothschild]] stated during the parliamentary debate that "for the majority of the Jews who go to Palestine it is a question of migration or of physical extinction".&lt;ref&gt;[[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] Debates, Volume 347 column 1984 [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1939/may/22/palestine-1#column_1984]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some supporters of the Conservative {{Citation needed|reason=mistake. i.e. conservative|date=January 2014}} Government were opposed to the policy on the grounds that it appeared in their view to contradict the [[Balfour Declaration]]. Several government MPs either voted against the proposals or abstained, including Cabinet Ministers such as the illustrious Jewish [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Leslie Hore-Belisha, 1st Baron Hore-Belisha|Leslie Hore-Belisha]].&lt;ref name="Morris2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benny Morris|title=Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGtVsBne7PgC&amp;pg=PA158|date=25 May 2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-78805-4|pages=158–159|quote=The White Paper was denounced as 'illegal,' as it contradicted the terms of the Mandate, [ ... ] In Britain, although the Conservatives had a comfortable majority in Parliament, the government was put on the defensive: Two cabinet ministers (Leslie Hore-Belisha and Walter Elliot) and 110 Conservative MPs abstained, and all of Labour's MPs voted against.

===League of Nations===
The supervising authority of the League of Nations, the [[Permanent Mandates Commission]] abstained unanimously from endorsing the White Paper,{{Citation needed|reason=mistake. Four out of seven rejected the paper, while the other three members have not supported it|date=January 2014}} though four out of seven members thought the new policy was inconsistent with that mandate.&lt;ref&gt;Hilberg, Raul, ''The Destruction of the European Jews,'' (1961) New Viewpoints, New York 1973 p.717 n.7&lt;/ref&gt; The League of Nations commission rejected the White Paper because it was in conflict with the terms of the Mandate as put forth in the past. The outbreak of the Second World War suspended any further deliberations.&lt;ref name="avalon.law.yale.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris2011p159"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benny Morris|title=Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGtVsBne7PgC|date=25 May 2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-78805-4|page=159|chapter=chp. 4|quote="Capping it all, the Permanent Mandates Commission of the Council of the League of Nations rejected the White Paper as inconsistent with the terms of the Mandate."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arab Reactions===
The [[Arab Higher Committee]] initially argued that the independence of a future Palestine Government would prove to be illusory, as the Jews could prevent its functioning by withholding participation, and in any case real authority would still be in the hands of British officials. The limitations on Jewish immigration were also held to be insufficient, as there was no guarantee immigration would not resume after five years. In place of the policy enunciated in the White Paper, the Arab Higher Committee called for "a complete and final prohibition" of Jewish immigration and a repudiation of the Jewish national home policy altogether.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In June 1939,{{sfn|Khalif|1991|p=283}} Hajj [[Amin al-Husayni]] initially "astonished" the other members of the Arab Higher Committee by turning down the White Paper. Al-Husayni, according to [[Benny Morris]], turned the advantageous proposal down for the entirely selfish reason that "it did not place him at the helm of the future Palestinian state."&lt;ref&gt;[[Benny Morris|Morris, Benny]], "The Tangled Truth", ''[[The New Republic]]'', May '07, '08 [https://newrepublic.com/article/books/the-tangled-truth]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1940, after two weeks of meetings with the British representative [[S. F. Newcombe]],{{sfn|Cohen|2014|p=367|ps=: "In July 1940, Colonel S.F. Newcombe. an Arabist who had served with T.E. Lawrence during World War One, made a Middle East tour sponsored by the British Council. His mission was to improve Arab public opinion about Britain. The government agreed that he should stop over in Baghdad to try unofficially, with the help of Nuri al-Said, to obtain the Mufti's endorsement of the While Paper. On his way Newcombe was briefed in Jerusalem by the High Commissioner. He was instructed to meet only with Nuri al-Said and with two prominent Palestinians. Jamal Husayni the Multi's cousin, and Musa Alami, but not with the Mufti himself. Newcombe stayed in Baghdad for 2 weeks."}} the leader of the Palestinian Arab delegates to the [[London Conference (1939)|London Conference]], [[Jamal al-Husseini]] and fellow delegate [[Musa al-Alami]], agreed to the terms of the White Paper and both signed a copy of it in the presence of the Prime Minister of Iraq, [[Nuri as-Said]].&lt;ref&gt;Buheiry, Marwan R. (1989) ''The Formation and Perception of the Modern Arab World. Studies by Marwan R Buheiry.'' Edited by Lawrence I. Conrad. Darwin Press, Princeton. {{ISBN|0-87850-064-2}}. p.177&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zionist Reactions===
Zionist groups in Palestine immediately rejected the White Paper and began a campaign of attacks on government property and Arab civilians which lasted for several months. On 18 May a Jewish general strike was called.&lt;ref name="Inquiry. p.54"/&gt;

On 27 February 1939, in response to enthusiastic Arab demonstrations following reports that the British were proposing to allow Palestine independence on the same terms as Iraq, a coordinated [[Irgun]] bombing campaign across the country killed 38 Arabs and wounded 44.&lt;ref&gt;Kayyali, Abdul-Wahhab Said (no date) ''Palestine. A Modern History'' Croom Helm. {{ISBN|086199-007-2}}. p.221.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the White Paper, the right-wing Zionist militant group [[Irgun]] began formulating plans for a rebellion to evict the British and establish an independent Jewish state. [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]], the founder of Irgun, who had been exiled from Palestine by the British, proposed a plan for a revolt to take place in October 1939, which he sent to the Irgun High Command in six coded letters. Under Jabotinsky's plan, he, together with other "illegals", would arrive in Palestine by boat, and the Irgun would help him and other passengers escape. Next, the Irgun would raid and occupy Government House, as well as other British centers of power in Palestine, raise the Jewish national flag, and hold them for at least 24 hours even at a heavy cost. Simultaneously, Zionist leaders in Western Europe and the United States would proclaim an independent Jewish state in Palestine, and would function as a government-in-exile. Irgun seriously considered carrying out the plan, but was concerned over the heavy losses it would doubtless incur. Irgun leader [[Avraham Stern]] (who would later break from Irgun to form [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]]), formed a plan for 40,000 armed Jewish fighters recruited in Europe to sail to Palestine and join the rebellion. The Polish government supported his plan, and began training Jews and setting aside weaponry for them. However, the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939 quickly put an end to these plans.&lt;ref&gt;Zev Golan: ''Free Jerusalem: Heroes, Heroines and Rogues who Created the State of Israel''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Penkower, Monty Noam: Decision on Palestine Deferred: America, Britain and Wartime Diplomacy, 1939-1945&lt;/ref&gt;

After the outbreak of war in September 1939, the head of the [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency for Palestine]] [[David Ben-Gurion]] declared: 'We will fight the White Paper as if there is no war, and fight the war as if there is no White Paper.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Jewish Brigade|The Brigade]] by Howard Blum, p.5. In 1946, a [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] song published in the ''[[Yishuv]]'' by Jacob Jacobs ad Isadore Lilian included these lyrics: ''Tserisn muz vern dos vayse papir, In der fremd viln mir mer nit zayn. Habeyt mishomyim ureey, Groyser got kuk arop un ze, Vi men yogt undz, vi men plot undz, Got, her oys undzer geshrey.'' "They don't care about Jewish anguish, The [[White Paper]] must be torn, We don't want to be away from our home anymore." (As described in "Palestine in Song," ''YIVO News'' No. 204, Winter 2008, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent events==
On 13 July the authorities announced the suspension of all Jewish immigration into Palestine until March 1940. The reason given for this decision was the increase in illegal immigrants arriving.&lt;ref&gt;''Survey''. p.56.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1940, the British High Commissioner for Palestine issued an edict dividing Palestine into three zones. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In Zone A, consisting of about 63 percent of the country including the stony hills, land transfers save to a Palestinian Arab were in general forbidden. In Zone B. consisting of about 32 percent of the country, transfers from a Palestinian Arab save to another Palestinian Arab were severely restricted at the discretion of the High Commissioner. In the remainder of Palestine, consisting of about five percent of the country-which, however, includes the most fertile areas - land sales remained unrestricted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]] - Appendix IV
 copy at [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/angap04.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In December 1942, when extermination of the Jews became public knowledge, there were 34,000 immigration certificates remaining.  In February 1943, the British government announced that the remaining certificates could be used as soon as practicable to rescue Jewish children from southeastern Europe, particularly Bulgaria.  This plan was partly successful but many people who received certificates were not able to emigrate (but those in Bulgaria survived).&lt;ref name="ofer"&gt;Ofer, Dalia, ''Escaping the Holocaust'' (1990) pages 218ff, 290.&lt;/ref&gt; In July it was announced that any Jewish refugee who reached a neutral country in transit would be given clearance for Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Ofer, Dalia, ''Escaping the Holocaust'' (1990) page 219&lt;/ref&gt; During 1943 about half the remaining certificates were distributed,&lt;ref&gt;Ofer, Dalia, ''Escaping the Holocaust'' (1990) page 290&lt;/ref&gt; and by the end of the war there were 3,000 certificates left.&lt;ref&gt;Ovendale, R, "The Palestine Policy of the British Labour Government 1945-1946", ''International Affairs'', Vol. 55, pages 409-431.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of World War II, the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] conference voted to rescind the White Paper and establish a Jewish state in Palestine, however the Labour Foreign Minister, [[Ernest Bevin]] persisted with the policy and it remained in effect until the British departed Palestine in May 1948.

After the war, the determination of [[After the Holocaust|Holocaust survivors]] to reach Palestine led to large scale [[Aliyah Bet|illegal Jewish migration]] to Palestine. British efforts to block the migration led to violent resistance by the Zionist underground.

Illegal immigrants detained by the British Government were interned in [[Jews in British camps on Cyprus|camps on Cyprus]]. The immigrants had no citizenship and could not be returned to any country. Those interned included a large number of children and orphans.

From October 1946, the British Government, under the 'severest pressure' from the USA, relented and allowed 1,500 Jewish migrants a month into Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Hilberg, Raul ''The Destruction of the European Jews'', (1971) New Viewpoints ed. New York, 1973 p.729&lt;/ref&gt; The gesture was in deference to the recommendations of the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]].&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Anglo-American Committee'' (1946) Cmd.6808 pp.65-66&lt;/ref&gt; Half of those admitted came from the [[Cyprus internment camps|prison camps for illegal immigrants in Cyprus]] due to fears that a growing Jewish presence in Cyprus would lead to an uprising there.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Times]]'' 11/08/46{{clarify|date=March 2013}} pg 35, UK Foreign Office document 371/52651&lt;/ref&gt;

The Provisional Council of Israel's first constitutional act was a Proclamation that "All legislation resulting from the British Government's White Paper of May, 1939, will at midnight tonight become null and void. This includes the immigration provisions as well as the land transfer regulations of February, 1940."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Proclamation by Head of Government, Sunday May 16, 1948 |url= http://info.jpost.com/1998/Supplements/1948/features.html |work=''The Palestine Post'' Internet Edition |publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21586">A '''wildland–urban interface''' (or WUI) is a zone of transition between unoccupied land and human development. Communities that are within {{convert|0.5|mi|km}} of the zone may also be included.  These lands and communities adjacent to and surrounded by [[wildland]]s are at risk of [[wildfire]]s.

==Definitions==
[[File:Wildland Urban Interface Catalonia.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the wildland-urban interface in Catalonia featuring intermix and interface zones.]]
The [[US Forest Service]] defines the wildland-urban interface as the place where "homes and wildlands meet or intermingle", or more specifically, where "humans and their development meet or intermix with wildland fuel".&lt;ref name="USDAFS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stein|first1=Susan M.|last2=Comas|first2=Sara J.|last3=Menakis|first3=James P.|last4=Steward|first4=Susan I.|last5=Cleveland|first5=Helene|last6=Bramwell|first6=Lincoln|last7=Radeloff|first7=Volker|title=Wildfire, Wildlands, and People: Understanding and Preparing for Wildfire in the Wildland-Urban Interface|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/openspace/fote/reports/GTR-299.pdf|website=USDA Forest Service|publisher=USDA|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more quantitative definition is provided by the [[Federal Register]], which defines WUI areas as those containing at least one housing unit per 40 acres. Federal Register definitions can be combined with quantitative criteria to classify the WUI into two categories:

* Intermix WUI, or lands that contain at least one housing unit per 40 acres in which vegetation occupies at least 50% of terrestrial area, and
* Interface WUI, or lands that contain at least one housing unit per 40 acres, contain less than 50% vegetation, and lie within 2.4 km of a heavily vegetated area.
** A "heavily vegetated area" is defined as an area containing over 75% wildlife vegetation and occupies at least 5 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of terrestrial area.

The main difference between these types of WUI are that homes in intermix WUI are interspersed with vegetation, whereas homes in interface WUI are adjacent to heavy vegetation.&lt;ref name="Radeloff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radeloff|first1=V. C.|last2=Hammer|first2=R. B.|last3=Stewart|first3=S. I.|last4=Fried|first4=J. S.|last5=Holcomb|first5=S. S.|last6=McKeefry|first6=J.

==WUI growth and causes==

From 1990 to 2000, WUI area in the United States increased by 18 percent, covering 6 million additional homes. As of 2013, it was reported that the number of wildfires in the United States exceeding 50,000 acres had been steadily increasing since 1983, with the bulk of the change occurring from 2003 to 2013. The intensity of these fires was found to be increasing as well, contributing to an observed increase in costs related to reducing fire risks, fighting wildfires, and protecting property.&lt;ref name="USDAFS"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; WUI growth has also been noted in other places throughout the world, including Argentina, France, South Africa, Australia, and Mediterranean regions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SYPHARD|first=ALEXANDRA D.|last2=RADELOFF|first2=VOLKER C.|last3=HAWBAKER|first3=TODD J.|last4=STEWART|first4=SUSAN I.|date=January 16, 2009|title=Conservation Threats Due to Human-Caused Increases in Fire Frequency in Mediterranean-Climate Ecosystems|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01223.x|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=758–769|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01223.x|issn=0888-8892|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Radeloff|first=Volker C.|last2=Helmers|first2=David P.|last3=Kramer|first3=H.

===Population shifts===
Factors behind WUI growth include population growth, housing growth in wildland areas, population shifts, and the expansion of cities into wildlands. In the United States, WUI growth is partially attributed to population shifts towards the West and South. Additionally, as of 2013, the migration of retiring [[baby-boomers]] to smaller communities closer to scenic natural resources (“amenity migration”) is expected to contribute to WUI growth as well.&lt;ref name="USDAFS"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1990 and 2010, the WUI was the fastest-growing land use type in the United States, and 97% of new WUI areas were the result of new housing rather than increases in wildlife vegetation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Ecological factors===

Keane, et al. attribute the increase in WUI area to ecological factors such as climate change, insect pests, and diseases, which have resulted in more arid and flammable landscapes.&lt;ref name="Keane Eco"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keane|first1=Robert E.|last2=Agee|first2=James K.|last3=Fulé|first3=Peter|last4=Keeley|first4=Jon E.|last5=Key|first5=Carl|last6=Kitchen|first6=Stanley G.|last7=Miller|first7=Richard|last8=Schulte|first8=Lisa A.|title=Ecological effects of large fires on US landscapes: benefit or catastrophe?|journal=International Journal of Wildland Fire|date=2008|volume=17|pages=696-712|url=http://oregonstate.edu/dept/eoarc/sites/default/files/publication/617.pdf|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change can result in significant shifts in wildlife composition due to changes in temperature and precipitation.&lt;ref name="Keane Climate"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keane|first1=Robert E.|last2=Holsinger|first2=Lisa M.|last3=Parsons|first3=Russell A.|last4=Gray|first4=Kathy|date=2008|title=Climate change effects on historical range and variability of two large landscapes in western Montana, USA|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2008_keane_r001.pdf|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|volume=254|pages=375-389|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Population shifts can result in unintended ecological consequences resulting in higher landscape flammability. For example, flammable materials present in housing serve as a direct means of wildfire spread, while landscaping can cause non-native species to spread.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

To a small degree, vegetation growth into or near settled areas can lead to WUI growth. Between 1990 and 2010, vegetation growth accounted for 3% of all WUI growth in the United States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Impact on environment ===
Environmental issues related to WUI growth extend beyond the increased risk of wildfire damage to human settlements. For example, housing growth in WUI regions can displace and fragment native vegetation. Additionally, the introduction of non-native species by humans through landscaping can change the wildlife composition of interface regions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other factors can also have impacts on the environment, including pets which can kill large quantities of wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loss|first=Scott R.|last2=Will|first2=Tom|last3=Marra|first3=Peter P.|date=2013-01-29|title=The impact of free-ranging domestic cats on wildlife of the United States|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2380|journal=Nature Communications|language=En|volume=4|issue=1|doi=10.1038/ncomms2380|issn=2041-1723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forest fragmentation is another impact of WUI growth, which can lead to unintended ecological consequences. For instance, increased forest fragmentation can lead to an increase in the prevalence of Lyme disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownstein|first=John S.|last2=Skelly|first2=David K.|last3=Holford|first3=Theodore R.|last4=Fish|first4=Durland|date=2005-09-27|title=Forest fragmentation predicts local scale heterogeneity of Lyme disease risk|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00442-005-0251-9|journal=Oecologia|language=en|volume=146|issue=3|pages=469–475|doi=10.1007/s00442-005-0251-9|issn=0029-8549}}&lt;/ref&gt; One possible reason for this effect is the production of high-density isolated populations of transmission vectors such as ticks and mice. Isolated forest patches in fragmented environments tend to be surrounded by unfavorable habitats, which hinders the dispersal of infected species and increases their local density. Additionally, disease vectors in isolated patches can undergo genetic differentiation, increasing their survivability as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=Julie A.|last2=Marrotte|first2=Robby R.|last3=Desrosiers|first3=Nathalie|last4=Fiset|first4=Jessica|last5=Gaitan|first5=Jorge|last6=Gonzalez|first6=Andrew|last7=Koffi|first7=Jules K.|last8=Lapointe|first8=Francois-Joseph|last9=Leighton|first9=Patrick A.|date=2014-05-07|title=Climate change and habitat fragmentation drive the occurrence ofBorrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, at the northeastern limit of its distribution|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/eva.12165|journal=Evolutionary Applications|language=en|volume=7|issue=7|pages=750–764|doi=10.1111/eva.12165|issn=1752-4571|pmc=4227856|pmid=25469157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increases in wildfire risk pose a threat to conservation in WUI growth regions. Between 1985-94 and 2005-14, the area burned by wildfires in the United States nearly doubled from 18,000 to 33,000 square kilometers, and this increase can partly be attributed to WUI growth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In North America, Chile, and Australia, unnaturally high fire frequencies have resulted in incidences of exotic annual grasses replacing native shrublands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Wildfire Risk Assessment==

As of 2013, 32 percent of homes, apartments, and other human dwellings in the United States are contained within the WUI, and this figure is expected to grow over time. Wildfires can pose a risk to any area containing vegetation, as embers transported by wind can ignite fires a mile or more away from a flame front.&lt;ref name="USDAFS" /&gt; The increase in wildfire prevalence in the United States between 1985-94 and 2005-14 resulted in a tripling of federal wildfire suppression expenditures from $0.4 billion per year to $1.4 billion per year, indicating that wildfires pose a potent economic risk to communities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Identification of high-risk areas===
Geospatial quantification of wildfire risk can highlight key areas for policy and emergency response planning. Several factors are used to assess the threat wildfires pose to human settlements. These factors can mainly be divided into ecological factors (e.g. climate, seasonal weather patterns, and vegetation) and human factors (e.g. arrangement and density of housing). Quantitative risk assessments can be produced by combining data such as the probability of large wildfires, estimated wildfire intensity, population density, and the proximity of human settlements to roads. One approach, used by Haas et al., combines geographical data on population density and probability of exposure to a large wildfire to produce maps that highlight spatial variability in wildfire risk. The highest-risk areas identified by this method are those where moderate population levels overlap with or are adjacent to wildlands with high chances of wildfire exposure.&lt;ref name="Haas"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haas|first1=Jessica R.|last2=Calkin|first2=David E.|last3=Thompson|first3=Matthew P.|date=2013|title=A national approach for integrating wildfire simulation modeling into Wildland Urban Interface risk assessments within the United States|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2013_haas_j001.pdf|journal=Landscape and Urban Planning|volume=119|pages=44-53|doi=10.1016/j.landurbplan.2013.06.011|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Effect of population density on wildfire risk ====
Population density correlates with wildfire risk for two main reasons. First, people can cause fires; from 2001 to 2011, 85% of wildfires recorded by National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) were caused by people. Second, housing can intensify wildfires because they can potentially contain highly flammable material such wood shakes, and can be a source for mobile embers which can cause wildfires to spread.&lt;ref name="USDAFS" /&gt;

The relationship between population density and wildfire risk is non-linear. At low population densities, human ignitions are low, and ignitions increase with population density. However, in a range of environments sampled from North America, the Mediterranean Basin, Chile, and South Africa, a threshold of population density was observed at which fire occurrence decreased. Possible reasons for this decrease include decreases in open space for ember transmission, fuel fragmentation due to urban development, and higher availability of fire-suppression resources. For this reason, areas with moderate population densities tend to exhibit higher wildfire risk than areas with low or high population densities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Wildfire simulation modeling===
Some factors typically used in wildfire simulations include historical spatial wildfire data, geographic features, geographical distributions of vegetation, and climate.&lt;ref name="Keane Climate" /&gt; One algorithm commonly used to simulate wildfire spread are Minimum Travel Time (MTT) algorithms.&lt;ref name="Haas"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to MTT algorithms, fire boundaries were primarily modeled through the application of [[Huygens–Fresnel principle|Huygens' principle]] by treating boundaries as wave fronts on a two-dimensional surface. MTT algorithms are capable of calculating fire perimeters in a nearly-equivalent way finding the minimum time it takes for a fire to travel between two points, and are advantageous due to their speed and scalability. However, MTT methods come at the cost of assuming nearly-constant environmental conditions such as wind direction and fuel moisture dynamics, and thus tend to be more apt for short-timescale simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Finney|first=Mark A|date=August 2002|title=Fire growth using minimum travel time methods|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/x02-068|journal=Canadian Journal of Forest Research|volume=32|issue=8|pages=1420–1424|doi=10.1139/x02-068|issn=0045-5067|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk Management==
The vulnerability of a community to wildfires is partly determined by its decisions regarding land use, building standards, and landscaping choices. Community-focused risk management efforts often focused on reducing the flammability of dwellings and wildland vegetation in and around high-risk areas.&lt;ref name="USDAFS"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distribution of responsibilities ===
[[File:Fire Adapted Communities infographic.jpg|thumb|287x287px|By distributing wildfire management responsibilities, communities can mitigate risks.]]
Calkin, et al. present a conceptual framework for risk mitigation in the WUI. In this model, two major objectives that lead to decreased home loss are (a) reducing the probability of home exposure to wildfires and (b) reducing the susceptibility of houses to wildfire loss. The former can be split into three actionable objectives: reducing wildfire occurrence, reducing wildfire size and intensity, and reducing human development in fire-prone areas. The latter can be converted into a single actionable objective, i.e. increasing home resistance to ignition. In the framework, responsibility for actions is attributed to three major groups: land management agencies, local governments, and homeowners. Land management agencies can help reduce wildfire occurrence through ignition prevention, and can help reduce wildfire size and intensity through fuel and vegetation management, building community preparedness, and responding to wildfires with suppression efforts. Local governments can help reduce human development in fire-proof areas through proper land use management and zoning. Individual homeowners can also reduce the risk of home loss by taking action to manage the flammability of their homes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calkin|first=David E.|last2=Cohen|first2=Jack D.|last3=Finney|first3=Mark A.|last4=Thompson|first4=Matthew P.|date=2014-01-14|title=How risk management can prevent future wildfire disasters in the wildland-urban interface|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1315088111|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=111|issue=2|pages=746–751|doi=10.1073/pnas.1315088111|pmc=3896199|pmid=24344292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Community response ====
{{See also|Fire-adapted communities}}
One approach to mitigating fire risk is adapting communities to adapt to fire risks rather than escalate prevention efforts. Fire-adapted communities are defined by the United States Forest Service as "a knowledgeable and engaged community in which the awareness and actions of residents regarding infrastructure, buildings, landscaping, and the surrounding ecosystem lessens the need for extensive protection actions and enables the community to safely accept fire as a part of the surrounding landscape." Fostering the development of a fire-adapted community can help save resources for local and federal governments by reducing the amount of resources needed for fire mitigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/fire/prev_ed/fac/faqs.pdf|title=Frequently Asked Questions – Fire Adapted Communities|last=|first=|date=July 10, 2014|website=USDA Forest Service Fire and Aviation Management|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001135211/https://www.fs.fed.us/fire/prev_ed/fac/faqs.pdf|archive-date=October 1, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ways homeowners can reduce risk ===
The susceptibility of a home to ignition is determined by its home ignition zone (HIZ), or the home and its surrounding area up to 100-200 feet. Individual homeowners can use the following guidelines to determine what areas of their home can be improved to mitigate fire risk:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dnr.wi.gov/files/pdf/pubs/fr/fr0474.pdf|title=Home Ignition Zone Self Assessment for Homeowners|last=|first=|date=2011|website=Firewise Wisconsin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430183553/https://dnr.wi.gov/files/pdf/pubs/fr/fr0474.pdf|archive-date=April 30, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Ways to make a house fire-resistant:
** Ensure that the house's roof is made of fire-resistant materials and all exterior walls are fire resistant.
** Enclose eaves and vents with wire mesh.
** Ensure that decks and porches are made of fire-resistant materials.
* Guidelines for landscaping:
** Keep vegetation away from windows, as windows can break during a fire and let in embers.
** Ensure plants within 3-5 feet of the home are low-growing, well-maintained and [[deciduous]].
** Keep bare dirt, mowed grass, or non-combustible mulch in a "no-grow" zone within 3-5 feet of the home.
** Limit the presence of evergreens (which are highly flammable) within 30 feet of the home.
** Keep vegetation thin within 30 to 100 feet of the home.
* Guidelines for outdoor maintenance:
** Trim back tree limbs at least 10 feet from roof.
** Ensure power lines are away from tree branches and nearby dead or dying trees.
** Clean off fallen leaves, pine needles, and other debris from roof, gutters, window wells, and underneath decks.
** Prune tree branches 6 feet up from ground (especially [[Evergreen|evergreens]]).
** Keep lawn mowed, green, and free of leaf litter and needles.
** Ensure yard is free of dead trees and shrubs.
* Ways to keep flammables at a safe distance:
** Ensure outbuildings within 30 feet of homes or other buildings are clear of flammables.
** Store firewood and other flammable materials at least 30 feet from buildings.
** Clear the area 10 feet surrounding propane tanks or fuel oil tanks.

=== Challenges to risk management ===
Wildfires are an ecological process that naturally contribute to the development of ecosystems, and many wildlands are historically predisposed to periodic fire. Because of this, complete eradication of fires in WUI regions is typically not feasible. Additionally, wildfires are capable of spreading through far distances, presenting logistical challenges to wildfire management efforts. At a governmental level, communities that have developed within or near fire-prone areas typically vary widely in terms of wildfire risk and preparedness, which can confound coordination efforts. Lastly, a mismatch between the reality of wildfire risk and sociopolitical expectations of wildland fire management services may lead to challenges to strategic risk management.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Safety of women journalists ==
{{Main|Safety of Journalists}}'''Safety of journalists''' is the ability for [[journalist]]s and media professionals to receive, produce and share information without facing physical or moral threats. Women journalists also face increasing dangers such as sexual assault, "whether in the form of a targeted sexual violation, often in reprisal for their work; mob-related [[sexual violence]] aimed against journalists covering public events; or the sexual abuse of journalists in detention or captivity. Many of these crimes are not reported as a result of powerful cultural and professional stigmas."&lt;ref&gt;The United Nations Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and Issues of Impunity, 2012, https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/un-plan-on-safety-journalists_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends Report in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002610/261065e.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Threats on women journalists ===
[[Women in journalism|Women journalists]], whether they are working in an insecure context, or in a [[newsroom]], face risks of physical assault, [[sexual harassment]], [[sexual assault]], rape and even murder. Women journalists are vulnerable to attacks not only from those attempting to silence their coverage, but also from sources, colleagues and others.&lt;ref&gt;Lanza, Edison. 2017.

Available at http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/expression/docs/publications/ZONAS_SILENCIADAS_ENG.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 global survey of nearly 1,000 journalists, initiated by the International News Safety Institute (INSI) in partnership with the [[International Women's Media Foundation]] (IWMF) and with the support of UNESCO, found that nearly two-thirds of women who took part in the survey had experienced intimidation, threats or abuse in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;International Media Women's Foundation and International News Safety Institute 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period from 2012 through 2016, UNESCO's Director-General denounced the killing of 38 women journalists, representing 7 per cent of all journalists killed.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/unesco-condemns-killing-of-journalists&lt;/ref&gt;  The percentage of journalists killed who are women is significantly lower than their overall representation in the media workforce. This large gender gap is likely partly the result of the persistent under-representation of women reporting from war-zones or insurgencies or on topics such as politics and crime.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Janet, Nick Mosdell, and James Griffiths. 2016.

=== Online harassment of women journalists data ===

== Media freedom ==
'''Media freedom''' is the freedom to participate in media, the rights of expression, and access to and production of media content. These are all issues that can be fully understood only by considering their [[gender equality]] dimensions as they often overlap, and they have been compounded by the growing complexity of the digital sphere. Across all these issues, women do not enjoy full equality with men, nor do they have their work valued to the same extent as men. In many [[newsroom]]s around the world, there continues to be a culture that makes it difficult for women to progress. In such workplaces, [[harassment]] is common, and a lack of monitoring means that even with gender equality [[Policy|policies]] in place, they are often ineffective in challenging [[Sexism|gender discrimination]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Under-representation of women ===
A related challenge has been the absence of women's voices as an issue in media freedom, including in [[internet governance]] policy-making more generally. This ongoing issue appears to have stagnated in recent years. The [[Internet Governance Forum]] (IGF) Dynamic Coalition on Gender and Internet Governance, which pushes for recognition of the gendered issues relating to internet governance, reports that although women's participation at the 2015 IGF reached close to parity, women were still underrepresented in discussion and debates: only 37 per cent of panelists were women, a decline from 40 per cent the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Gender Dynamic Coalition and APC. 2016. Internet Governance Forum 2015: Learnings from the Gender Report Cards. GenderIT. Available at &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.genderit.org/resources/internetgovernance-forum-2015-learnings-genderreport-cards&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In organizations, such as the Internet Association for Assigned Names and Numbers ([[ICANN]]), senior [[leadership]] positions remain largely dominated by men. In 2017, ICANN's board of directors consisted of four women and 16 men. Minimizing the divide between the number of women and men in senior decision-making roles in relation to internet governance is an important step to ensuring that gender-based issues relating to [[Access to information|access]], [[privacy]] and security are prioritized.&lt;ref&gt;Kovacs, Anja, Avri Doria, Bruno Zilli, Margarita Salas, and Women's Legal and Human Rights Bureau. 2012. Critically Absent: Women’s Rights in Internet Governance. Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.genderit.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; resources/critically-absent-womeninternet-governance-policy-advocacytoolkit&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of prevailing inequality, [[civil society]] continues to be a force for progress. Other organizations are working to push for greater representation and key standard-setting bodies, such as the Gender and Internet Governance eXchange, initiated by the [[Association for Progressive Communications]], which aims to redress the gap in participation by women's and [[Sexual rights|sexual rights’ activists]] in internet governance policy processes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Freedom of information ===
Women's [[freedom of information]] and access to information is far from being equal to men's. It's the access to information gender divide. Social barriers such as [[Literacy|illiteracy]] and lack of digital empowerment have created stark inequalities in navigating the tools used for access to information, often exacerbating lack of awareness of issues that directly relate to women and gender, such as [[Reproductive health|sexual health]]. There have also been examples of more extreme measures, such as local community authorities banning or restricting mobile phone use for girls and unmarried women in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;Kovacs, Anja. 2017. ‘Chupke, Chupke’: Going Behind the Mobile Phone Bans in North India. Internet Democracy Project. Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://genderingsurveillance&lt;/nowiki&gt;. internetdemocracy.in/phone_ban/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of States, including some that have introduced new laws since 2010, notably censor voices from and content related to the [[LGBT]]QI community, posing serious consequences to access to information about [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]].&lt;ref&gt;York, Jillian C. 2016. The State of Free Expression Online in Southeast Asia. Electronic Frontier Foundation. Available at &lt;https:// www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/statefree-expression-online-southeast-asia&gt;. Accessed 4 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Digital platforms play a powerful role in limiting access to certain content, such as YouTube’s 2017 decision to classify non-explicit videos with LGBTQ themes as ‘restricted’, a classification designed to filter out ‘potentially inappropriate content’.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Elle. 2017. LGBT community anger over YouTube restrictions which make their videos invisible. The Guardian. Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/&lt;/nowiki&gt; technology/2017/mar/20/lgbt-communityanger-over-youtube-restrictions-whichmake-their-videos-invisible&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Online activity ===
Gendered aspects of [[media freedom]] intersect heavily with [[Safety of Journalists|journalists’ safety]]. [[Women in journalism|Women journalists]] face unique concerns, such as personal safety when dealing with confidential [[Journalism source protection|sources]], which can restrict their freedom of expression and add challenges that can hamper their ability to carry. Another dimension is the manifestation of physical violence as virtual violence through the increased incidence of [[Online hate speech|hate speech]] and abuse directed towards women and the LGBTQI community. Such abuse has had a chilling effect and disrupted the [[online participation]] of these communities. Countering the proliferation of such abuse has proved a serious challenge for policy-makers wanting to minimize the harm directed towards vulnerable groups. To mark [[International Women's Day]] in 2017, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression noted the challenges for [[government]]s, corporate bodies and [[Non-governmental organization|civil society organizations]] to address such abuses while remaining attentive to [[international human rights law]]. He counseled against censorship and undue restrictions on [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] as a means of curbing [[Cyberbullying|online abuse]], warning that such restrictions could ‘end up undermining the rights of the very women for whom governments and corporate actors may seek to provide redress’.&lt;ref&gt;OHCHR. 2017. UN experts urge States and companies to address online genderbased abuse but warn against censorship&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media pluralism ==
Media pluralism is evaluated in terms of [[Access to information|access]], plurality of economic models and diversity of content. [[Gender equality]] in decision-making roles, the media workforce and representation in the media has not yet been reached in any of these areas according to [[UNESCO]]'s World Trends Report.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

=== Background ===
In the mid-1970s, pioneering academics made the first systematic analysis of women's relationship to and visibility in the mass media and in their ground-breaking study, they used the term ‘[[symbolic annihilation]]’ (originally credited to [[George Gerbner]]) to describe what they found.&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman, Gaye, A.K. Daniels, and J Benoit. 1978. Hearth and Home: Images of Women the Mass Media. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Available at &lt;Tuchman, G., Daniels, A.K., and Benoit, J. (1978) Hearth and Home: Images of Women in the Mass Media: Oxford: Oxford University Press.&gt;. Accessed 25 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Almost 40 years later, most gender and media scholars would suggest that progress has stalled, and there is significant work left to be done, including in relation to [[mainstream media]]. Women still feature less frequently than men in news discourse; women journalists and media professionals are often locked out of the more prestigious beats, and their occupation of senior positions within media organizations is still minimal. According to the [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Global Media Monitoring]] Report in 2015 women made up only one in four media decision-makers, one in three reporters and one in five experts interviewed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Women's visibility in newspaper, television and radio increased by only seven percentage points between 1995 (17 per cent) and 2015 (24 per cent).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Macharia, Sarah. 2015. Who Makes the News? Global Media Monitoring Project 2015. London, Toronto: World Association for Christian Communication (WACC). Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://cdn.agilitycms&lt;/nowiki&gt;. com/who-makes-the-news/Imported/ reports_2015/global/gmmp_global_ report_en.pdf&gt;. Accessed 14 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  The opportunities afforded to ‘ordinary’ citizens by the creation of [[Alternative media|alternative online news]] platforms has meant, however, that women's voices and perspectives are finding expression via these informal media channels.

=== International recognition ===
The existence of problems regarding gender and media pluralism has also been recognized by regional and [[international organization]]s and agencies over several decades. In 2010, UNESCO developed a comprehensive set of Gender-Sensitive Indicators for Media, aimed at encouraging media organizations to benchmark themselves against equality criteria.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/publications-and-communication-materials/publications/full-list/gender-sensitive-indicators-for-media-framework-of-indicators-to-gauge-gender-sensitivity-in-media-operations-and-content/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Council of the European Parliament adopted the recommendation made by the [[European Institute for Gender Equality]], that the media industry should adopt and implement gender equality indicators relating to women in decision-making, gender equality policies and women on boards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P7-TA-2013-0074+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 60th session of the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women|Commission on the Status of Women]] in 2016, United Nations (UN) Women launched a new partnership with major media organizations to draw attention to and act on the [[Sustainable Development Goals|2030 agenda for sustainable development]], which aims to eradicate all forms of inequality.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[UN Women]] launched ‘Step it Up for Gender Equality’, which had the tagline of ‘Planet 50:50 by 2030’. At the launch of that initiative, 70 nations committed to the gender equality agenda, and two years later, that number had increased to 93. In 2016, a review by UN Women of actions taken by these pledging nations reported a large number of initiatives, although none of them explicitly mentioned the media. Yet despite these initiatives, women remain excluded or marginalized in the media on the one hand, or else stereotyped and [[Minimisation (psychology)|trivialized]] on the other. Longitudinal studies of women and news predict that this is unlikely to change soon. At the current pace of change, parity of visibility between women and men is unlikely to occur for another 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;Macharia, Sarah. 2015. Who Makes the News?

The Step it Up for Gender Equality Media Compact comprises a coalition of media outlets from around the globe and from diverse sectors who have committed themselves to focusing on gender equality in three main ways: in their reporting routines, by disrupting [[stereotype]]s and biases; by increasing the number of women in their organizations, including in leadership and decision-making roles; and in developing gender-sensitive corporate practices. At its launch, 39 media houses had already signed up as founding members of the Compact and although each will devise their own internal agenda, being a member of the Compact requires a minimum set of actions to be carried out.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unwomen.org/en/get-involved/step-it-up/media-compact&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender equality in the media workforce ===
In many countries, as many women as men are graduating from media, journalism and communication degree programmes and entering the industry.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Byerly, Carolyn M. 2011. Global Report on Status of Women in News Media. Washington D. C.: International Women’s Media Foundation (IWMF). Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www&lt;/nowiki&gt;. iwmf.org/our-research/global-report/&gt;. Accessed 8 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1995, when the first substantial analysis of women media professionals across 43 nations was produced, women constituted around 40 per cent of the media [[workforce]].&lt;ref&gt;National Watch on Images of Women in the Media (MediaWatch). 1995. Global Media Monitoring Project: Women’s Participation in the News. National Watch on Images of Women in the Media (MediaWatch).&lt;/ref&gt;  Women are encouraged not to go into ‘hard’ news beats and instead are channeled into areas of news that are allegedly of more ‘interest’ to women and are also commonly held as being less prestigious. A [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Monitoring Project]] (Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP)) 2015 report found that 31 per cent of stories on politics and 39 per cent of stories about the economy have female by-lines.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;The Global Media Monitoring Project is the longest-running longitudinal and global study of gender and news media and provides a snapshot of how women and men feature in, make and report the news on one day every five years. The first GMMP report was in 1995 and the most recent one (in 2015) published its findings in November 2015. The Project provides comparative data across time and region. Teams in 114 countries who monitored 22,136 stories published, broadcast or tweeted by 2,030 distinct media outlets carried out the 2015 report. In sum, data were collected on the work of 26,010 journalists and the representation of 45,402 individuals who featured in or were quoted in the stories.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stories about politics and crime see the least number of women reporters across all regions with the exception of Asia and Latin America. Unlike men, even when women do work on ‘hard’ news stories, they often struggle to achieve visibility for their copy: just over a third (37 per cent) of stories in newspapers, television and radio [[News broadcasting|newscasts]] had a female by-line or were visibly or audibly reported by women, the same as in GMMP's 2005 study. More focused individual country analyses show exactly the same trends; for example, research from the United States shows that while women journalists are writing on a wider range of topics, they are still a minority of [[columnist]]s at the major dailies.&lt;ref&gt;Harp, Dustin, Ingrid Bachmann, and Jaime Loke. 2014. Where are the women? The presence of female columnists in US opinion pages. Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly 91 (2): 289–307.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of presenting on broadcast news, the 2015 [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Global Media Monitoring Project]] found that the global proportion of women was 49 per cent, the same as in 2000 and two percentage points below the 1995 finding. Since 2005, the number of women working as reporters in broadcast news has dropped by four percentage points in television and radio.&lt;ref&gt;http://whomakesthenews.org/gmmp/gmmp-reports/gmmp-2015-reports&lt;/ref&gt;

Closer analysis from the [[World Trends report]] shows that women were more numerous on television (57 per cent) and less numerous on radio (41 per cent), where ‘looks’ are obviously far less important. The majority of younger presenters were women, but that trend reversed for older presenters, nearly all of whom were men. There were almost no women reporters recorded as older than 65.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[Women's Media Center]] (WMC) 2017 report on women and the media in the United States shows a picture that has little changed from the GMMP's latest findings or indeed, from findings of its own previous studies. At 20 of the nation's top news outlets, women produced 37.7 per cent of news reports, an increase of 0.4 percentage points compared to 2016.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Women's Media Center. 2017. The Status of Women in U.S. Media 2017. Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.womensmediacenter.com/&lt;/nowiki&gt; pages/the-status-of-women-in-u.s.media-2017&gt;. Accessed 19 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  In broadcast news, women’s presence as anchors, reporters and field journalists actually declined by nearly seven percentage points between 2015 and 2016. The WMC study found that these gender-based disparities existed across all news media as much in newspapers, online news, wire services as broadcast, but were especially stark in television news.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The digital world is as likely to perpetuate the same gender divisions that exist in the off-line world as the opposite. There is little evidence to suggest that [[digital media]] are employing or promoting more women than other parts of the [[media ecology]]. The [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|GMMP]]’s latest findings suggest that women's visibility as both citizens and media professionals in [[Online newspaper|online news sites]] and Twitter feeds was 26 per cent, only two percentage points higher than for television, radio and print. The situation behind the scenes at large internet companies, which hold influence over which news content is presented most visibly and are responsible for moderation of discussion and comments, has been equally dire.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Women and decision-making ===
The challenge for many women is much more than just breaking into the industry, but also being able to advance to the highest levels in their careers. The Global Report on the Status of Women in the News Media found that women in media occupied just over a quarter of the jobs in top management (27 per cent) and [[governance]] (26 per cent) positions.&lt;ref&gt;Byerly 2011. The largest recent study of women media professionals, this report, which was researched for the International Women's Media Foundation and supported by UNESCO, looked at 59 countries and 522 news outlets.&lt;/ref&gt; The regions that fared best for women representation were [[Central Europe|Central]] (33 per cent) and Eastern Europe (43 per cent) and the [[Nordic countries]] (36 per cent). Elsewhere, women comprised only about a fifth of governance positions and held less than 10 per cent of top management jobs in Asia and the Pacific region. A major European project funded by the [[European Institute for Gender Equality]] (EIGE) found very similar findings. Men held most of the senior management positions and board membership in 99 media houses across the [[European Union]]. Public sector organizations were more likely to recruit and promote women into senior positions than private sector media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). 2017.

Accessed 19 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The study also revealed that sexual harassment remains a key issue for women: just under 20 per cent of women media professionals said that they had personal experience of sexual harassment and the majority of those women said that the perpetrator was a senior colleague.

For Mary Kosut, women remain vastly underrepresented as media owners, a trend that has continued unabated as media concentration has increased through media consolidation and convergence.&lt;ref&gt;Kosut, Mary, ed. 2012. Encyclopedia of Gender in Media. SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender and representation ===
Many feminist media scholars have argued that what we see in front of the camera is determined to some extent by who is behind the camera and there is some reason to believe that more women in the newsroom would produce news that is more diverse. Several studies, including the [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Global Media Monitoring Project]] (GMMP), show that women journalists are more likely to source women in their stories than men, leading to more balanced reporting which is better able to reflect the views of more and diverse communities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The 2015 GMMP was able to make comparisons across the 20 years in which it has been operating. Despite women's considerable advancement over the past two decades in the public and [[private sector]]s, female appearances in television, radio and print rose by only seven percentage points between 1995 (17 per cent) and 2015 (24 per cent). Where women most often appear in media, it is when they speak from personal experience (representing 38 per cent), while only 20 per cent of [[spokesperson]]s and 19 per cent of experts featured in stories are women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The underepresentation of women in media content extends across regions. Women featured in stories as 32 per cent of experts interviewed in North America, followed by the Caribbean (29 per cent) and Latin America (27 per cent). In the southern African region, Gender Links’ latest Gender and Media Progress Study covered 14 countries and found that women's views and voices accounted for a mere 20 per cent of news sources across Southern Africa media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to Sarah Macharia, even if more women appear in media, there may be limited impact on the entrenched biases and stereotypes present in media content. This can promote narrow gender roles that limit the choices and options available to everyone. This is why many actors continue to encourage all media workers to become more gender-sensitive through training and internal [[Policy|policies]] that monitor coverage and promote greater awareness of gender issues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== The picture for women in media ===
Women's accomplishments in the media sector have long remained under-recognized by traditional professional and news organizations, a trend that remains unchanged. Women have won only a quarter of [[Pulitzer Prize]]s for foreign reporting and only 17 per cent of awards of the [[Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Asquith, Christina. 2016. Why Don't Female Journalists Win More Awards? – The Atlantic. The Atlantic. Available at &lt;https:// www.theatlantic.com/international/ archive/2016/03/women-foreigncorrespondents/472596/&gt;. Accessed 25 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of organizations, mostly gender focused, have launched dedicated prizes to recognize achievements of women in media. The [[International Women's Media Foundation]] continues to recognize the courageous work of women journalists. In 2007, the [[Alliance of Women Film Journalists]]’ began giving out the EDA Awards annually to recognize women filmmakers and [[Photojournalism|photojournalists]]. More recently, in 2015 the [[African Development Bank]] began sponsoring a category for [[Women's rights]] in Africa, designed to promote gender equality through the media, as one of the prizes awarded annually by [[One World Media]].&lt;ref&gt;African Development Bank. 2015.

Accessed 25 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In considering the way in which women’s contribution to the news environment is made visible, the [[UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize]] is an annual award that honors a person, organization or institution that has made a notable contribution to the defense and/or promotion of press freedom anywhere in the world. Nine out of 20 winners have been women.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/prizes/guillermo-cano&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Poynter Institute]] since 2014 has been running a Leadership Academy for Women in Digital Media, expressly focused on the skills and knowledge needed to achieve success in the digital media environment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.poynter.org/training-events/leadership-academy-women-digital-media&lt;/ref&gt; Similar initiatives have begun to appear in other regions. UNESCO has also led workshops media professionals and community media in Gabon and Burundi, as part of its global efforts to enhance gender equality in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Kenmoe, Elvis Michel. 2016.

== Media independence ==
'''Media independence''' is the capacity of a news outlet to provide accurate and [[Bias|unbiased]] information to the public. In a 2016 study of board members’ views in North America and Western Europe on the introduction of quotas, for example, individuals whose organizations (and countries) were committed to actions to increase women's representation were enthusiastic about the effects; but in contrast, individuals working in contexts without such commitments were rarely keen to embrace such strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Wiersema and Mors, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addressing issues around gender and media independence, a number of advocacy and media monitoring initiatives have developed over the past few years that provide data on persistent gender inequalities. Media unions at local, national, regional and global levels have been prominent in working to protect the interests of women media workers, initiating women's [[caucus]]es, appointing women's officers, establishing women's conferences and developing handbooks of good practice. [[International Federation of Journalists]] (IFJ), for example, has a Gender Council (GC) which co-ordinates its gender-focused work. Since its inception, the GC has been IFJ's main vehicle to guide projects; formulate policy concerning gender and good practice; and advocate for and mainstream gender-based issues throughout IFJ, its projects and its member unions.  During its 2016 Congress, the work of the GC was officially enshrined and protected through inclusion in the IFJ Constitution. Women media professionals themselves have also been active in forming their own networks to support and encourage each other, organizing events, developing mentoring schemes and initiating awards that recognize women's accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;International Federation of Journalists. 2017. Byte Back: IFJ launches guide to combat cyber harassment in South Asia. Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ifj.org/nc/fr/news-singleview/backpid/33/article/byte-backifj-launches-guide-to-combat-cyberharassment-in-south-asia/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender equality in the media workplace ===
Research over the past two decades on the working conditions of women media professionals has mostly shown that women sometimes face hostility in the [[newsroom]], which can be partly explained by the lack of organizational policies relating to gender equality and reporting mechanisms for [[harassment]]. The [[International Women's Media Foundation]]’s 2011 global study of women in the news media, cited in the previous chapter, found that more than half of the news media organizations surveyed had a company-wide policy on gender equality, but with significant variations between regions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  More than two-thirds of organizations based in Western Europe and Africa had such policies, compared with a quarter in the Middle East and North Africa and less than 20 per cent in Central and Eastern European countries. The [[European Institute for Gender Equality]]’s 2013 report, which looked at 99 major media houses across Europe, found that a quarter of organizations had policies that included a provision for gender equality, often as part of broader equality directives in the society. It was notable that of the 99 organizations, public service bodies were much more likely than commercial ones to have equality policies in place. Media houses with such policies in place typically lacked mechanisms to monitor their effectiveness, thereby limiting their potential to effect change. The limitations of work practices to address gender inequalities do not reflect a lack of advocacy as there is evidence of a growing commitment towards gender equality on the part of media organizations.

=== Media monitoring and advocacy ===
In addition to the Global Media Monitoring Project, there are several regional initiatives which regularly monitor gendered aspects of the media, some of which also work with journalists to promote change within newsrooms.

The South Africa-based Gender Links, formed in 2001 to promote ‘gender equality in and through the media’ in Southern Africa, leads the media cluster of the Southern Africa Gender Protocol Alliance. Gender Links promotes media advocacy through global initiatives such as the Global Alliance on Media and Gender (GAMAG), hosting gender and media summits, developing policy in collaboration with regulators and working with media organizations through training and policy development. Gender Links is currently developing Centres of Excellence for Gender in the Media in 108 Newsroom across Southern Africa.

In 2016, the [[World Association for Christian Communication]] (WACC), the Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP) Network and other partners launched a campaign to end news media sexism by 2020. The ‘End News Media Sexism’ campaign encourages and supports advocacy initiatives that promote changes in media policies and journalism practice. The campaign is taking a multi-disciplinary approach and uses a variety of different tools to promote awareness, including a gender scorecard against which media organizations are measured.

The [[FEMNET|African Women's Development and Communication Network]] (FEMNET), founded in 1988 as part of a broader project to promote women's empowerment in Africa, prioritizes women's development in the field of communication, where they have created and managed platforms to share information, ideas, strategies and experiences to foster cross-learning and more effective implementation of shared goals. FEMNET provides strategic policy recommendations through the production of reports and policy briefs. It has led extensive local [[capacity building]] initiatives, such as facilitating women's access to [[Information and communications technology|ICTs]] in Africa. In Asia, the South Asia Women's Network (SWAN) has rolled out a research project titled ‘Women for Change: Building a Gendered Media in South Asia’. Covering nine South Asian countries, it is partly supported by UNESCO’s [[International Programme for the Development of Communication]].

In addition, a number of national organizations work locally to redress the disparity in women's representation and participation in the media. Women, Media and Development (known by its [[Arabic]] acronym TAM) is a Palestine-based organization founded in 2004. TAM works with local women to promote their increased representation in the media and to foster an environment where they are able to effectively communicate and advocate for their rights. TAM provides training for women on how to access and use various media platforms, in addition to promoting community awareness and advocacy initiatives. TAM has facilitated capacity building and worked to counter stereotypes of women in the media by producing gender sensitive guides and training manuals, in addition to implementing projects that aim to increase women's access to decision-making positions and [[Civic engagement|civic participation]].

=== Formal and informal professional associations ===
A number of formal and informal networks of women media professionals also support women in the media. One of the oldest is the [[Alliance for Women in Media]] (AWM), originally established in 1951 as American Women in Radio and television, which supports women across all media to expand their networks, participate in training and professional development and celebrate their talents.&lt;ref&gt;https://allwomeninmedia.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, it began its annual programme of awards to recognize the work of programme-makers and content-providers in promoting women and women’s issues. A more regionally focused example is the [[Marie Colvin]] Journalists’ Network, a bilingual Arabic-English online community of women journalists working in the [[Arab world]] that aims to assist vulnerable local [[Women in journalism|women journalists]] who lack support in relation to safety training, legal contracts, insurance or [[Psychology|psychological]] care.&lt;ref&gt;n.d. Marie Colvin Journalists’ Network. Marie Colvin Journalists’ Network. Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://mariecolvinnetwork.org/en/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Media unions at local, regional and global levels have established caucuses for women and have campaigned to encourage more women to stand for elected office within formal union structures. In 2001, the [[International Federation of Journalists]] found that women represented 29 per cent of union membership in 38 countries but just 17 per cent of members on union governing bodies: in its 2010 report, it found that women’s representation on boards had increased only slightly, to 15 per cent. In Europe, between 2006 and 2013, women’s union membership went down from 45 per cent to 42 per cent and board membership also declined, from 39 per cent to 36 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifj.org/press-room/publications-reports/browse/weiter/category/reports/&lt;/ref&gt;
