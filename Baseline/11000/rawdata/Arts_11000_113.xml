[[Image:Albemarle Street (S).jpg|thumb|Southward view of Albemarle Street, from the Grafton Street junction.]]

'''Albemarle Street''' is a street in [[Mayfair]] in [[central London]], off [[Piccadilly]]. It has historic associations with [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], whose publisher [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] was based here, and [[Oscar Wilde]], a member of the [[Albemarle Club]], where an insult he received led to his suing for libel and to his eventual imprisonment. It is also known for its art galleries and the [[Brown's Hotel]] is located at 33 Albemarle Street.

== History ==
[[Image:ClarendonHouseSKILLMAN, W. after SPILBURGH J.jpg|thumb|View of Clarendon House, now demolished. Albemarle Street runs through the centre of the site of the house.]]
Albemarle Street was built by a syndicate of developers headed by [[Sir Thomas Bond]]. The syndicate purchased a Piccadilly mansion called [[Clarendon House]] from [[Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle]] in 1684, which had fallen into ruin due to neglect caused by the dissolute duke's spendthrift ways. It was sold for £20,000, a fifth less than the duke had paid for it only nine years previously despite the land values in the area increasing in the intervening period. The house was demolished and the syndicate proceeded to develop the area. At that time the house backed onto open fields and the development of the various estates in Mayfair was just getting underway. The syndicate also built [[Old Bond Street]], [[Dover Street]] and Stafford Street.&lt;ref name="Bebbington1972"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bebbington|first=Gillian|title=Street Names of London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CdoQgAACAAJ|year=1988|publisher=Batsford|isbn=978-0-7134-5449-9|origyear=1972|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albemarle Street was the first one-way street created for the purpose of better traffic flow in London. The decision was taken after a series of lectures by [[Humphry Davy]] at the [[Royal Institution]] caused long traffic jams in the capital because of the horrendous queues formed by [[Hansom Cab|horsedrawn carriages]] bringing in the eager audience. Albemarle Street was made a one-way street to avoid further incidents of such congestion.

==Notable residents==

[[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]] (1661–1724), a leading minister of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], had a house in Albemarle Street where he died in 1724.

[[Victor Spencer, 1st Viscount Churchill]] (1864–1934), a [[Page of Honour]] to [[Queen Victoria]] and British peer, was born at 32 Albemarle Street.

[[Anne Lister]] (1791&amp;ndash;1840), a notable Victorian lesbian, stayed at 29 Albemarle Street in rooms owned by Hawkins, who also had premises in [[Dover Street]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historytoherstory.org.uk/index.php?targetid=84&amp;PHPSESSID=e31f6272b533bbfc4f63d2633197e334 Anne Lister in London 1819-1839] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813091727/http://www.historytoherstory.org.uk/index.php?targetid=84&amp;PHPSESSID=95a0cdc9b3ec9b173e52b065e63f1431 |date=13 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Albemarle Club]] was originally in Albemarle Street and relocated to Dover Street nearby before its closure. [[Oscar Wilde]] was a member. In 1895, the [[Marquess of Queensberry]] left his calling card for Wilde with the infamous note "For Oscar Wilde, posing as a somdomite" (sic). This led to Wilde's failed libel action and subsequent criminal prosecution.

The publisher [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] was located at 50 Albemarle Street during the 19th and 20th centuries. [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]]'s [[Byron's Memoirs|memoirs]] were destroyed in the fireplace on the first floor after his death. Sir [[John Betjeman]], the poet and broadcaster was another Murray author.

Frenchman Alexander Grillion opened Grillion's Hotel at No. 7 in 1803.  [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] stayed here in 1814, before his return to France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Mayfair, Belgravia, and Bayswater
|author=Geraldine Edith Mitton
|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21218/21218.txt
|year=1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the meeting place of [[Grillion's]] dining club. The [[Royal Thames Yacht Club]] was later based here.

[[Image:Royal Institution Shepherd TH.jpg|thumb|The Royal Institution in Albemarle Street (c.1838).]]
The [[Royal Institution]] is located at 21 Albemarle Street and forms an imposing backdrop on the street with its row of classical columns on its frontage. The building has been greatly enlarged and redeveloped since 1799 when the Institution was founded, and is now a [[Grade I listed building]]. Because of the Institution's popularity (through its scientific lectures), Albemarle Street became London's first [[one-way street]] to avoid traffic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?action=displayContent&amp;id=00000006657 |title=Making traffic history - Albemarle Street |accessdate=30 December 2012 |publisher=The Royal Institution of Great Britain |first=Frank |last=James |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206155534/http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?action=displayContent&amp;id=00000006657 |archivedate=6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The naturalist [[Thomas Huxley]] founded the [[X Club]] as a dining club meeting for the first time on 3 November 1864 at St George's Hotel, Albemarle Street, with a select membership of nine proponents of the [[evolution]]ary "new reformation" in naturalism who supported the ideas of [[Charles Darwin]] and became increasingly influential in late 19th century [[science]].

Rev. [[William Webb Ellis]] (1806–1872) was an Anglican clergyman who is famous for allegedly being the inventor of Rugby football whilst a pupil at Rugby School. He graduated from Oxford with a BA in 1829 and received his MA in 1831. He entered the Church and became chaplain of St George's Chapel, Albemarle Street, London. Where he published his 'Sermons: Preached in St. George's Chapel, Albemarle Street; to Which Is Added, an Essay On the Prophecies Relative to Christ'.[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sermons-Preached-Albemarle-Prophecies-Relative/dp/B00A6FJ8EI]

In the 1950s, [[Ernö Goldfinger]]'s design for two office buildings at 45–46 Albemarle Street was praised for its sensitivity to the surrounding Georgian architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designmuseum.org/design/erno-goldfinger Ernö Goldfinger / Designing Modern Britain — Design Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Galleries==
[[Image:Albemarle Street (N).jpg|thumb|Northward view of Albemarle Street, from the Stafford Street junction.]]

The '''Altar frontal from Avià''' is a rare [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[altar]] frontal exhibited at the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]] in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;Guia del Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya.p. 25. MNAC, 2004. {{ISBN|84-8043-136-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the front of the [[altar]] of the church of [[St. Mary of Avià]], in the county of [[Berguedà]], later moved to [[MNAC Barcelona]], while the church has a replica in place. It is dated to the 13th century or earlier, and was painted by an unknown artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.mnac.cat/fitxatecnica.html;jsessionid=1be3734bc116cb40ed37627bb0055750aac1142ee18f11b6dbffd5470903a561?inventoryNumber=015784-000# The artwork at MNAC's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The frontal is painted in [[tempera]] on a wood panel, with [[parchment]] overlaps, ''[[pastiglia]]'' [[stucco]] [[relief]] decoration and remains of additional vanished metal plates. It is divided into five areas, dominated by the central [[Virgin and Child]]. The figures are elongated, with [[Byzantine art|Byzantine-style]] costumes and  frontal poses. Four scenes surround the central figures: the [[Annunciation]] and [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]], [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]], the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] and the [[Presentation of Jesus]] in the temple. Both the frame and the divisions between the compartments are decorated with [[gilding|gilded]]  [[gypsum]] plaster, imitating precious metal.

'''Andreas Christian Riis Carstensen''' (9 November 1844, Sennels, near [[Thisted]] - 5 May 1906,  [[Helsingør]]) was a Danish painter who specialized in maritime scenes; notably from [[Greenland]].

== Biography ==
His father, Jørgen (1805-1856) was the local [[pastor]]. After his sudden death, Andreas' mother took him to [[Haderslev]], where he grew up. After his [[Confirmation (Lutheran Church)|confirmation]], he became a sailor. Following several long voyages, an extended stay in [[Québec]] prompted him to try his hand at drawing.&lt;ref name="K"&gt;[https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisKunstner.do?kunstnerId=2769 Biographical notes] @ Kunstindeks Danmark.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Carstensen-Umiak.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Summer Day in Greenland with an [[Umiak]].]]
He served for a short time as a Navy [[conscript]] in the [[Second Schleswig War]], then  settled in Copenhagen.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;[http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Maler/A.C._Riis_Carstensen Brief biography] from the ''Dansk Biografisk Leksikon'' @ Den Store Danske.&lt;/ref&gt; The painter, [[Heinrich Hansen (painter)|Heinrich Hansen]], an acquaintance from Haderslev, recommended him to [[Carl Dahl]], who gave him lessons in marine painting.&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; He also attended the [[Copenhagen Technical College]], then enrolled at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Art]], but left without graduating in 1868.

That same year, he exhibited three works that aroused some critical interest. He became short of funds, however, and went to exhibit in [[New York City]]. In 1870, at the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], he tried to volunteer, but there was no need for naval forces, so he returned to America and stayed there until 1873; making a short visit to the [[Danish West Indies]].&lt;ref name="D" /&gt;

Beginning in 1875, he was a regular participant in the [[Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition]]. He also continued his studies in Paris at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] under [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]. In 1879, he won the {{ill|Neuhausenske Prize|da|De Neuhausenske Præmier}} for a painting of sunset on the [[Kattegat]].&lt;ref name="D" /&gt;

In 1884, he fulfilled a long-standing desire to visit Greenland and returned there in 1888. Two years later, he was married and began a series of trips to Egypt, creating eleven paintings commissioned by the brewer [[Carl Jacobsen]], who was also a noted art collector.&lt;ref name="K" /&gt;

He died in 1906 at his home in Helsingør. His widow survived him by forty-four years.

'''Asian American Women Artists Association''' ('''AAWAA''') is a nonprofit arts organization that supports and promotes the work of [[Asian Americans|Asian American]] [[women artists]] in the visual, literary, and performing arts through activities such as art events, lectures, artists salons, and member exhibitions.&lt;ref name="aawaa.net"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aawaa.net/about-us/mission/|title=Mission {{!}} Asian American Women Artists Association|website=aawaa.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based in [[San Francisco]], it was founded in 1989 by artists including [[Flo Oy Wong]], [[Betty Nobue Kano|Betty Kano]], [[Moira Roth]], and [[Bernice Bing]].&lt;ref name="aawaa.net"/&gt;

== History ==
Kano and Wong were motivated to found the AAWAA after attending the 1989 national meeting of the [[Women's Caucus for Art]], where they felt that Asian American women were heavily underrepresented, and by joining a project started by Moira Roth to create a collection of [[Reversal film|slides]] of artworks by women of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cla.purdue.edu/WAAW/AsianAmerican/WoCA.html|title=Women of Color in Art (WoCA) Slide Project History|last=Wong|first=Flo Oy|date=1998|website=Women Artists of the American West|publisher=[[Purdue University]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first meeting was held at Kano's home in Berkeley in March of that year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/903585580|title=Entering the picture: Judy Chicago, the Fresno Feminist Art Program, and the collective visions of women artists|last=Fields|first=Jill|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415887687|location=|pages=242–254|chapter=Searching for Catalyst and Empowerment: The Asian American Women Artists Association, 1989-Present|oclc=903585580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Cheers to Muses: Contemporary Works by Asian American Women'' (2007) ==
''Cheers to Muses'' is an anthology published by the AAWAA in 2007. The book compiles 77 works, including fine art, poetry, creative writing, and non-fiction work. The works are created by 64 Asian American women ranging in age from 14 to 85.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aawaa.net/programs/cheers-to-muses/|title=Cheers to Muses {{!}} Asian American Women Artists Association|website=aawaa.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Worlds of Bernice Bing'' (2013) ==
''The Worlds of Bernice Bing'' is a documentary short film produced by the AAWAA, featuring the life and work of the lesbian Chinese American artist [[Bernice Bing]]. The film is directed by [[Madeleine Lim]], executive artistic director of the [[Queer Women of Color Media Arts Project]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.qwocmap.org/learn-more/team/|title=Team|date=2016-09-07|work=QWOCMAP|access-date=2017-12-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the film received the Audience Award at the Queer Women of Color Film Festival.

== Activities ==
* '''''Emerging Curators Program'''''
This program aims to stress an Asian American Women lens to curation, to promote Asian American Women in the arts, from a curating perspective and also benefits the artists who are under represented and lack exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aawaa.net/programs/|title=Programs {{!}} Asian American Women Artists Association|website=aawaa.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Mural Muses'''''
In 2015, in honor of its 25th anniversary, the AAWAA launched a campaign to create a large collective mural in San Francisco's [[Richmond District, San Francisco|Richmond District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/mural-muses-honors-history-achievements-female-asian-american-arists-n459926|title='Mural Muses' Honors History, Achievements of Female Asian-American Artists|last=Luhar|first=Monica|date=November 10, 2015|work=[[NBC News]]|access-date=2017-03-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mural is to honor the contributions of women artists in the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community. It is a response to the increased racial tensions and vandalism, and to increase the visibility of Asian American female artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-first-mural-for-asian-american-women-artists#/|title=The First Mural for Asian American Women Artists|website=Indiegogo|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Mural Muses" will be one of the large-scale murals in the Bay Area to honor Asian-American artists.

Melanie Elvena, programs manager at the AAWAA stated that the collaborative mural was another way to raise awareness for Asian-American women artists "in a space that has been traditionally male dominated."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/mural-muses-honors-history-achievements-female-asian-american-arists-n459926|title='Mural Muses' Honors History, Achievements of Female Asian-American Artists|last=Luhar|first=Monica|date=November 10, 2015|website=NBC News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''A Place of Her Own'''''
''A Place of Her Own (PLACE)'' is an art-based program, first created in 2008 by the AAWAA director Cynthia Tom. It is dedicated to improving women's mental health and seeks to challenge issues like colonization, racism, forced migration, and gender oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.brown.edu/ethn-1890v-s01-fall-2016/asian-american-women-artists-association-aawaa/|title=Asian American Women Artists Association (AAWAA) – Asian American Activism: The Continuing Struggle|website=blogs.brown.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based around the question in Virginia Woolf's ''A Room of One's Own'': "If you had a place of your own, what would it be?" The weekly workshops over the course of six months lead up to a professionally curated exhibition. PLACE is open to all women, regardless of art ability of experience, and uses various art mediums.

{{Quote|text=PLACE offers down to earth healing tools, that relieve stress while opening up our ability to access and trust our intuition. The work is designed to help release underlying patterns and old habits and their links to individual, family and cultural histories and patterns of dysfunction.

In order to thrive and take ownership of our life's path, women must define what is important to them alone, practicing self love and self-care.}}

'''''Ask the Dust''''' is a 2006 American-German film based on the book ''[[Ask the Dust]]'' by [[John Fante]].  The film was written and directed by [[Robert Towne]] and remains, {{asof|2015|lc=y}}, his last feature film. [[Tom Cruise]] (with [[Paula Wagner]] and [[Cruise/Wagner Productions]]) served as one of the film's producers.  The film was released on a limited basis on March 17, 2006 and was entered into the [[28th Moscow International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Moscow2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=2006 |title=28th Moscow International Film Festival (2006) |accessdate=2013-04-21 |work=MIFF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421051006/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=2006 |archivedate=2013-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was filmed almost entirely in [[South Africa]] with the use of stages to portray [[Los Angeles]].

==Plot==
The story is set during the [[The Great Depression|Great Depression]], specifically around the time of the [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]]. Camilla ([[Salma Hayek]]) is a fiery, beautiful [[Mexico|Mexican]] café waitress who aspires one day to be above her current standing in society, to make something of herself, to give her and her future children a place and chance in the world. Farrell's character is portrayed as a struggling writer who comes to Los Angeles's [[Bunker Hill, Los Angeles, California|Bunker Hill]] area to start his writing career. Though he falls in love with Camilla, he does not marry her. Later, Camilla is infected by [[tuberculosis]] and leaves Arturo without informing him. When Arturo finds her, she is about to die and he promises to marry her, but Camilla dies and Arturo writes a novel dedicated to Camilla. Arturo writes a dedication in one of his books to her and throws it into the sand.

==Cast==
* [[Colin Farrell]] as Arturo Bandini
* [[Salma Hayek]] as Camilla Lopez
* [[Donald Sutherland]] as Hellfrick
* [[Eileen Atkins]] as Mrs. Hargraves
* [[Idina Menzel]] as Vera Rivkin
* [[Justin Kirk]] as Sammy
* [[Dion Basco]] as Patricio/houseboy
* [[Jeremy Crutchley]] as Solomon, the bartender
* [[William Mapother]] as Bill
* [[Tamara Craig Thomas]] as Sally

==Production==
Part of the film was shot at [[Pinelands High School]], on fields modified to simulate a Los Angeles scenery.

==Film delays==
The rights to the novel once belonged to [[Mel Brooks]], though he let them lapse.  Towne met Fante in the 1970s.  This meeting led to his interest in the project. Despite finishing the script in the early 1990s, he couldn't find financial backing from a studio.  During this time, Farrell's role was originally set to be played by [[Johnny Depp]] but he dropped out.  Later [[Val Kilmer]] accepted the role and also dropped out.  Another delay was Hayek initially rejecting the role to avoid being typecast as a Mexican immigrant.  She accepted the role eight years later.

==Critical reception==
The film received negative to mixed reviews from critics. The review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 35% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 104 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ask_the_dust/ |title=Ask the Dust Movie Reviews, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=2008-03-29 |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080329155859/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ask_the_dust/| archivedate= 29 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] reported the film had an average score of 58 out of 100, based on 33 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/askthedust |title=Ask the Dust (2006): Reviews |accessdate=2008-03-29 |publisher=[[Metacritic]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080420075426/http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/askthedust| archivedate= 20 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13344">The role of an '''assistant director''' on a [[filmmaking|film]] includes tracking daily progress against the filming [[production schedule]], arranging logistics, preparing [[daily call sheet]]s, checking cast and crew, and maintaining order on the [[Set construction|set]]. They also have to take care of the health and safety of the crew.&lt;ref&gt;IMDB Glossary, &lt;https://www.imdb.com/glossary/A&gt; retrieved 2015-02-10&lt;/ref&gt; The role of an assistant to the [[Film director|director]] is often confused with assistant director but the responsibilities are entirely different. The assistant director manages all of the directors in development, pre-production, while on set, through post-production and is often involved in both personal management as well as creative aspects of the production process. Historically, assistant directing was a stepping stone to directing work; [[Alfred Hitchcock]] was an AD, as well as [[James McTeigue]] and [[Akira Kurosawa]]. This transition into film directing is no longer common in feature films. It is more common now for an assistant director to transition to a [[production management|theatre production management]] or [[film producer|producer]] role than to directing. 

== Sub-roles ==
Often, the role of assistant director is broken down into the following sub-roles:
* The '''first assistant director''' (first or 1AD) has overall AD responsibilities and supervises the second AD. The "first" is directly responsible to the director and "runs" the floor or set. The first AD and the [[unit production manager]] are two of the highest "[[below the line (film production)|below the line]]" technical roles in filmmaking (as opposed to creative or "[[Above the line (filmmaking)|above the line]]" roles) and so, in this strict sense, the role of first AD is non-creative.&lt;ref&gt;DGA Rates, &lt;http://www.dga.org/Contracts/Rates-2014-to-2017/ADs-UPMs-and-AssociateDir-2014-to-2017.aspx.{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&gt; Retrieved 2015-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Their responsibility is to keep the production on schedule throughout the day, communicate to the entire crew, and to maintain the safety and security of the staff and shot itself. An assistant director must be very good at estimating how long a scene will take. (Sometimes a scene running a few pages long on the screenplay can be shot relatively quickly, while a half page emotional key moment may take all day).&lt;ref&gt;CreativeSkillset.Org, "First Assistant Director," &lt;http://creativeskillset.org/creative_industries/film/job_roles/2937_first_assistant_director_first_ad&gt; Retrieved 2015-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IMDB Glossary, &lt;https://www.imdb.com/glossary/A&gt; retrieved 2015-02-10&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''second assistant director''' (second or 2AD) creates the [[daily call sheet]]s from the [[production schedule]],&lt;ref&gt;IMDB Glossary, &lt;https://www.imdb.com/glossary/A&gt; Retrieved 2015-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt; in cooperation with the production coordinator. The "second" also serves as the "backstage manager", liaising with actors, putting cast through make-up and wardrobe, which relieves the "first" of these duties. Supervision of the second second assistant director, third assistant director, assistant director trainees, and the setting of background (extras) are parts of the "second's" duties.&lt;ref&gt;CreativeSkillset.Org, "Second Assistant Director,"&lt;http://creativeskillset.org/creative_industries/film/job_roles/2938_second_assistant_director_second_ad&gt; Retrieved 2015-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;
** The '''second second assistant director''' (second second or 22AD) deals with the increased workload of a large or complicated production. For example, a production with a large number of cast may require the division of the aspects of backstage manager and the call sheet production work to two separate people.
* The '''third assistant director''' (third or 3AD) works on set with the "First" and may liaise with the "Second" to move actors from base camp (the area containing the production, cast, and hair and makeup trailers), organize crowd scenes, and supervise one or more production assistants (PA). There is sometimes no clear distinction between a 2AD and a 3AD. Although some industry bodies such as the [[Directors Guild of America]] have defined the roles in an objective way, others believe it to be a subjective distinction.&lt;ref&gt;CreativeSkillset.org, "Third Assistant Director," &lt;http://creativeskillset.org/creative_industries/film/job_roles/2939_third_assistant_director_third_ad.&gt; Retrieved 2015-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''additional assistant director''' (AAD or Additional) or '''fourth assistant director''' (4AD or "fourth") or "key production assistant" (key PA) may have a number of duties. Most commonly, the AAD has two broad job functions. One is the contraction of the duties of an AD where the AD acts as both second AD and third AD simultaneously. For example, a production with a large number of cast may pass the 2AD call sheet production work to that of the AAD, especially when the 2AD is already performing the additional work of a third AD. The other main use of an AAD is as an adjunct to the 3AD and 1AD for logistically large scenes where more ADs are needed to control large numbers of extras. The "Additional" may also serve where the complexity of the scene or specialized elements within it (stunts, period work) require or are best served by a dedicated AD in most respects equal to a first AD - directing and controlling a number of other ADs to direct action to the satisfaction of the 1AD and the director.
* A [[production assistant]] is one of the lowest crew in a film's hierarchy in terms of salary&lt;ref&gt;BECTU.org, UK,&lt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bectu.org.uk/filegrab/pactrates2006.pdf?ref%3D44 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530081616/http://www.bectu.org.uk/filegrab/pactrates2006.pdf?ref=44 |archivedate=2009-05-30 |df= }} PACT Pay-scale&gt; Retrieved 2013-10.&lt;/ref&gt; and authority. They perform various duties required of them by ADs.

The sub-roles of assistant directors differ among nations. For example, the distinction between second second AD and third AD is more common in North America. British and Australian productions, rather than having a second second AD, will hire a "second" 2AD experienced in the same duties, and trained to the same level, to allow a division of the duties. 3ADs in Britain and Australia have different duties from a second second AD, and the terms are not synonymous.&lt;ref&gt;UK National Career Service, &lt;https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/tvorfilmassistantdirector.aspx&gt; Retrieved 2015-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calling the roll ==
One of the first AD's most important responsibilities is to "call the roll" — that is, call out a series of specific [[Cue (theatrical)|cues]] for each take to ensure that all cast and crew on set are aware of exactly what is going on so they can perform their particular role at the appropriate moment.  Over the years, special procedures have been developed for this task to achieve maximum efficiency during shooting, which are usually some variant of the following:

# "Waiting on..." Though not technically part of calling the roll, first ADs may keep the set focused by frequently calling out which department is responsible for a delay in rolling a take. If the lights need to be adjusted, the first AD calls out, "waiting on lighting". If the actors are still in their trailer, the first AD calls out "Waiting on talent," etc. However, such calls can be regarded as applying excessive pressure to the department in question.
# "Final checks, please" (or "last looks"). Once everyone is in place, and rehearsals and [[Blocking (stage)|blocking]] have finished, the first AD calls out, "final checks" or "checks." This is the signal for any last minute adjustments, especially to hair, makeup, wardrobe and props.
# Traditionally, the first AD calls "quiet on the set." However, it is more common in current productions to hear first "Picture is up!" (or "Rehearsal's up" accordingly) followed by "Quiet please!" to alert everyone that the take is ready and imminent. "Lock it down" or more commonly "Lock it Up" is also a signal (particularly on location) to ensure nothing interrupts the take. This call is crucial for third assistant directors, as this is their primary responsibility during a take.
# "Turnover." While most AD's say both "roll sound" and "roll camera", "turnover" signals both the camera and sound departments to start rolling. The sound department will roll first. After a second or two, the sound recordist will confirm that the recording equipment is running at the correct speed by calling "Speed" or "Sound Speed." Hearing this, the [[clapper loader]] immediately calls out the "Scene" and "Take" numbers so that these details are on the recording. Simultaneously (or within a very few seconds) the Camera Operator or focus puller will roll the camera, and immediately the camera is confirmed as running at the correct speed, will call for the clapper-loader to "mark it" (or "smack it," "bang it," "tag it," etc.). This is done by showing the slate ("[[clapperboard]]") on camera, and bringing the clapper down to make a synchronisation point for audio (the sound of the clapper) and picture (the two parts of the clapper being seen to come together). With the slate quickly taken out of shot, and the camera refocused or repointed as necessary for the opening framing, the camera operator calls "set" or "frame" to indicate that all is ready to capture the action.
# The responsibility to call "action" is shared by either the first assistant director or the director, depending on the director's preference. "Action" may be preceded by "background action" if extras must be in motion in the shot, which is called by one of the lower AD's or sometimes the first. According to [[SAG-AFTRA]] regulations, the director must never address background actors directly on set{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}, so the AD's carry information from the director to background actors.
# Usually the director says "cut," but camera operators may also "cut" to save film if they know the take is unusable. The operator may also call "cut" if the camera has "rolled out," i.e. run out of film.  The Operator will not cut if there are other cameras still rolling or an interruption would ruin the actor's focus. 
# After the director has called "cut," the first AD will check whether the director is happy with the take, and conclude the roll with a direction such as "going again" or "that's a take two" if another take is required. If the director does not want another take, the AD will call "check the gate" (a signal for the [[Focus puller]] or camera assistant to confirm that the camera has not malfunctioned during a take, and that there is no hair or fluff in the aperture ("gate") where the film is exposed). When the camera has been checked, the call from the focus puller or camera assistant will be "clear gate!". Then, if that set up is complete, the AD may call "moving on" or "next set up." These announcements cue all departments and the ADs on set as to the next steps they must take. For example, "reset," "going again" and/or "back to one" may require a reset of elements in the frame extras, cars - anything that moved back to where they started, which the third AD will oversee.

The above roll sequence can be varied by, for example, eliminating the sound calls and the clapping of the slate if the shot is mute or "MOS" ("MOS" is a universal abbreviation for "Motor Only Shot").&lt;ref&gt;"MOS", FilmSound.org, &lt;http://filmsound.org/terminology/mos.htm&gt;. Retrieved 2011-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt; At other times, for expediency (e.g. if the shot begins with a closeup of a closed door which then opens), the slate may be shown at the end of the take rather than the beginning. In this case, once the sound is rolling, there is an audible announcement of "End board" (also "end slate," "tails," "tail slate," or "tail sticks") so that the editing department knows to look for the sync marks at the end of the action. At the conclusion of the action, the director will still call "cut", but the first AD (and possibly others) will immediately call "end board!" or so that the camera and sound recorder are not turned off before the clapper is clapped. Also, as a visual cue to the editors, the clapper-board will be shown inverted on camera.

[[File:Blurbing.jpg|thumb|The original blurb]]

A '''blurb''' is a short [[promotion (marketing)|promotional]] piece accompanying a creative work. It may be written by the author or publisher or quote praise from others. Blurbs were originally printed on the back or rear dust-jacket of a book, and are now found on home video cases, [[web portal]]s, and [[news website]]s. A blurb may introduce a newspaper or magazine feature story.

== History==
[[File: Gelett Burgess.jpg|thumb|Gelett Burgess circa 1910]]
In the US, the history of the blurb is said to begin with [[Walt Whitman]]'s collection, ''[[Leaves of Grass]]''. In response to the publication of the first edition in 1855, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] had sent Whitman a congratulatory letter, including the phrase "I greet you at the beginning of a great career": the following year, Whitman had these words stamped in gold leaf on the spine of the second edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/09/27/429723002/forget-the-book-have-you-read-this-irresistible-story-on-blurbs|title=The Curious Case Of The Book Blurb (And Why It Exists)|last=Dwyer|first=Colin|date=27 September 2015|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''blurb'' was coined in 1907 by American humorist [[Gelett Burgess]] (1866–1951).&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of The English Language''. Ed. [[David Crystal]]. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1995. p. 132. {{ISBN|0521401798}}&lt;/ref&gt; His short 1906 book ''Are You a Bromide?'' was presented in a limited edition to an annual trade association dinner. The custom at such events was to have a [[dust jacket]] promoting the work and with, as Burgess' publisher [[B. W. Huebsch]] described it, "the picture of a damsel—languishing, heroic, or coquettish—anyhow, a damsel on the jacket of every novel".

In this case, the jacket proclaimed "YES, this is a 'BLURB'!" and the picture was of a (fictitious) young woman "Miss Belinda Blurb" shown calling out, described as "in the act of blurbing." The name and term stuck for any publisher's contents on a book's back cover, even after the picture was dropped and only the text remained.

In Germany, the blurb is regarded to have been invented by [[Karl Robert Langewiesche]] around 1902. In German bibliographic usage, it is usually located on the second page of the book underneath the [[half title]], or on the dust cover.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

==Books==
A blurb on a book can be any combination of quotes from the work, the author, the publisher, reviewers or fans, a summary of the plot, a biography of the author or simply claims about the importance of the work.

In the 1980s, ''[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]]'' ran a regular feature called "[[Logrolling]] in Our Time" which exposed writers who wrote blurbs for one another's books.&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/2006/more/reviews/spy-the-funny-years-1200511592/ | title=Spy: The Funny Years | publisher=Variety | accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blurb requests===

Prominent writers can receive large volumes of blurb requests from aspiring authors.  This has led some writers to turn down such requests as a matter of policy.  For example, [[Gary Shteyngart]] announced in ''The New Yorker'' that he would no longer write blurbs, except for certain writers with whom he had a professional or personal connection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/an-open-letter-from-gary-shteyngart]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Neil Gaiman]] reports that "Every now and again, I stop doing blurbs.... The hiatus lasts for a year or two, and then I feel guilty or someone asks me at the right time, and I relent."&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2001/04/american-gods-blog-post-36.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob M. Appel]] reports that he received fifteen to twenty blurb requests per week and tackles "as many as I can."&lt;ref&gt;Writers's Voice, Oct 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parody blurbs===

Many humorous books and films parody blurbs that deliver exaggerated praise by unlikely people and [[Backhanded compliment|insults disguised as praise]].
* ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' – "Makes Ben Hur look like an Epic"
* ''[[1066 and All That]]'' – "We look forward keenly to the appearance of their last work"

The ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]'' satire of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', entitled ''[[Bored of the Rings]]'', deliberately used phony blurbs by deceased authors on the inside cover. One of the blurbs stated "One of the two or three books ...", and nothing else.

==Film==

Movie blurbs are part of the [[film promotion|promotional campaign]] for films, and usually consist of positive, colorful extracts from published reviews.

Movie blurbs have often been faulted for [[Fallacy of quoting out of context|taking words out of context]].&lt;ref&gt;Reiner, L. (1996). "Why Movie Blurbs Avoid Newspapers." ''Editor &amp; Publisher: The Fourth Estate, 129,'' 123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gelfmagazine.com/archives/the_best_worst_blurbs_of_2007.php |author=Bialik, Carl |authorlink=Carl Bialik |date=January 6, 2008|title=The Best Worst Blurbs of 2007: The 10 most egregious misquotes, blurb whores, and other movie-ad sins of 2007 |work=Gelf Magazine |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2010/03/good-blurbs-from-bad-reviews-repo-men-the-bounty-hunter-diary-of-a-wimpy-kid |author=Sancton, Julian |date=March 19, 2010 |title=Good Blurbs from Bad Reviews: ''Repo Men'', ''The Bounty Hunter'', ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' |work=Vanity Fair |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGlone, Matthew S. (2005). "Contextomy: The Art of Quoting Out of Context." ''Media Culture, &amp; Society,'' Vol. 27, No. 4, 511-522.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that "the blurbing game is also evolving as newspaper film critics disappear and studios become more comfortable quoting Internet bloggers and movie Web sites in their ads, a practice that still leaves plenty of potential for filmgoers to be bamboozled. Luckily for consumers, there is a cavalry: blurb watchdog sites have sprung up and the number of Web sites that aggregate reviews by established critics is steadily climbing. ... Helping to keep studios in line these days are watchdog sites like eFilmCritic.com and The Blurbs, a Web column for ''Gelf'' magazine written by Carl Bialik of ''The Wall Street Journal''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barnes |first=Brooks |title=Hollywood's Blurb Search Reaches the Blogosphere |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 6, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/weekinreview/07barnes.html |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' wrote in an "Explainer" column: "How much latitude do movie studios have in writing blurbs? A fair amount. There's no official check on running a misleading movie blurb, aside from the usual laws against false advertising. Studios do have to submit advertising materials like newspaper ads and trailers to the Motion Picture Association of America for approval. But the MPAA reviews the ads for their tone and content, not for the accuracy of their citations. ... As a courtesy, studios will often run the new, condensed quote by the critic before sending it to print."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2009/11/best_film_ever.html |author=Beam, Chris |authorlink=Chris Beam |date=Nov 25, 2009 |title='(Best) Film Ever!!!' How Do Movie Blurbs Work? |work=Slate |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many examples exist of blurb used in marketing a film being traceable directly back to the film's marketing team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Chögyam Trungpa''' ([[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]]: ''Chos rgyam Drung pa''; March 5, 1939 – April 4, 1987) was a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[meditation]] master and holder of both the [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] lineages, the eleventh [[Trungpa tülkus|Trungpa tülku]], a [[tertön]], supreme [[abbot]] of the [[Surmang|Surmang monasteries]], scholar, teacher, poet, artist, and originator of a radical re-presentation of [[Shambhala]] vision.

==Biography==

===Early years===
[[File:Khenpo gangshar2.jpg|thumb|[[Khenpo Gangshar]] (left) and Chögyam Trungpa|381x381px]]
Born in the [[Nangchen]] region of [[Tibet]] in March 1939, Chögyam Trungpa was eleventh in the line of [[Trungpa tülkus]], important figures in the [[Kagyu]] lineage, one of the four main schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Among his three main teachers were [[Jamgon Kongtrul]] of Sechen, HH [[Dilgo Khyentse|Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche]], and [[Khenpo Gangshar]].

The name ''Chögyam'' is a contraction of ''Chökyi Gyamtso'' ({{bo-tw|t=ཆོས་ཀྱི་རྒྱ་མཚོ་|w=Chos-kyi Rgya-mtsho}}), which means "ocean of [[dharma]]". ''Trungpa'' ({{bo-tw|t=དྲུང་པ་|w=Drung-pa}}) means "attendant". He was deeply trained in the Kagyu tradition and received his [[khenpo]] degree at the same time as [[Thrangu Rinpoche]]; they continued to be very close in later years. Chögyam Trungpa was also trained in the [[Nyingma]] tradition, the oldest of the four schools, and was an adherent of the [[Rime movement|''ri-mé'']] ("nonsectarian") ecumenical movement within Tibetan Buddhism, which aspired to bring together and make available all the valuable teachings of the different schools, free of sectarian rivalry.

At the time of his escape from Tibet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Lion's Jaws - Chögyam Trungpa's Epic Escape To The West|publisher=Mountain|year=2016|isbn=978-0-9950293-0-9|edition=1|last1=MacLean|first1=Grant}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trungpa was head of the Surmang group of monasteries.

=== Escape from Tibet ===
On April 23, 1959, twenty-year-old Trungpa set out on an epic nine-month escape from his homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa, Chögyam (1966). ''Born in Tibet.''164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacLean, Grant (2016). ''From Lion's Jaws: Chögyam Trungpa's Epic Escape To The West''&lt;/ref&gt; Masked in his account in ''Born in Tibet'' to protect those left behind,&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa, Chögyam (1966). ''Born in Tibet.''&lt;/ref&gt; the first, preparatory stage of his escape had begun a year earlier, when he fled his home monastery after its occupation by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA).&lt;ref&gt;''From Lion's Jaws,'' 65-69.&lt;/ref&gt; After spending the winter in hiding, he decided definitively to escape after learning that his monastery had been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;''Born in Tibet.'' 164&lt;/ref&gt; Trungpa started with [[Akong Rinpoche]] and a small party of monastics, but as they traveled people asked to join until the party eventually numbered 300 refugees, from the elderly to mothers with babies – additions which greatly slowed and complicated the journey. Forced to abandon their animals, over half the journey was on foot as the refugees journeyed through an untracked mountain wilderness to avoid the PLA. Sometimes lost, sometimes traveling at night, after three months’ trek they reached the Brahmaputra River. Trungpa, the monastics and about 70 refugees managed to cross the river under heavy gunfire,&lt;ref&gt;''Born in Tibet.''230&lt;/ref&gt; then, eating their leather belts and bags to survive, they climbed 19,000 feet over the Himalayas before reaching the safety of Pema Ko.&lt;ref&gt;''Born in Tibet.''239&lt;/ref&gt; After reaching India, on January 24, 1960 the party was flown to a refugee camp.&lt;ref&gt;''Born in Tibet.''248&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''From Lion's Jaws.''270&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2006 and 2010, independent Canadian and French researchers using satellite imagery tracked and confirmed Trungpa’s escape route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chronicleproject.com/stories_157.html|title=Finding the Escape Route |last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, five survivors of the escape in Nepal, Scotland and the U.S. confirmed details of the journey and supplied their personal accounts.&lt;ref&gt;''From Lion's Jaws.''10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent analysis has shown the journey to be directly comparable to such sagas as Shackleton’s 1914/17 Antarctic Expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fromlionsjaws.ca/place-in-history|title=Place in History|last=|first=|date= |website=|publisher=|access-date=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 accumulated research and survivors’ stories were published in a full retelling of the story,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fromlionsjaws.ca|title=From Lion's Jaws|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in the year preliminary talks began on the funding and production of a movie.

===Early teachings in the West===
{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
In exile in India, Trungpa began his study of English. In collaboration with Freda Bedi, who had initiated the project,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life and Accomplishments of Freda Bedi, in Karma Lekshe Tsomo, editor.

In 1963, with the assistance of sympathetic Westerners, Trungpa received a [[Spalding Trust|Spalding]] sponsorship to study [[Comparative Religion|comparative religion]] at [[St Antony's College, Oxford|St Antony's College]], [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Born in Tibet|last1=Trungpa|first1=Chogyam|publisher=Shambhala Publications|year=2000|isbn=1-57062-116-0|edition=4|location=Boston|pages=252}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2012-04-05 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|ZEvW__ZNlj0C|The Buddhist Handbook: A Complete Guide to Buddhist Teaching and Practice|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, upon the departure of the western [[Theravada Buddhism|Theravadan]] monk [[Namgyal Rinpoche|Anandabodhi]], Trungpa and [[Akong Rinpoche]] were invited by the Johnstone House Trust in [[Scotland]] to take over a [[meditation]] center, which then became [[Samye Ling]], the first Tibetan Buddhist monastery in the West (future actor and musician [[David Bowie]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shambhalasun.com/sunspace/?p=20767 "Bringing Chogyam Trungpa's "Crazy Wisdom" to the screen "]&lt;/ref&gt; was one of Trungpa's meditation pupils there). In 1970, after a break with Akong, Trungpa moved to the United States at the invitation of several students.

Shortly after his move to Scotland, a variety of experiences, including a car accident that left him partially paralyzed on the left side of his body, led Trungpa to give up his monastic vows and work as a lay teacher.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Born in Tibet, 1977 edition, Epilogue&lt;/ref&gt; He made that decision principally to mitigate students' becoming distracted by exotic cultures and dress and to undercut their preconceptions of how a guru should behave.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He drank, smoked, slept with students, and often kept students waiting for hours before giving teachings. Much of his behavior has been construed as deliberately provocative and sparked controversy. In one account, he encouraged students to give up smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], claiming that the smoking was not of benefit to their spiritual progress and that it exaggerated neurosis. Students were often angered, unnerved and intimidated by him, but many remained fiercely loyal, committed, and devoted.

Upon moving to the United States in 1970, Trungpa traveled around North America, gaining renown for his ability to present the essence of the highest Buddhist teachings in a form readily understandable to Western students. During this period, he conducted 13 Vajradhatu Seminaries, three-month residential programs at which he presented a vast body of Buddhist teachings in an atmosphere of intensive meditation practice. The seminaries also had the important function of training his students to become teachers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;last paragraph is exact quote from http://www.shambhala.org/teachers/chogyam-trungpa.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction of the Vajrayana===

Trungpa was one of the first teachers to introduce the esoteric practice of the [[Vajrayana]] to the West. According to Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso, "The one who mainly spread the Vajrayana in the West was Trungpa Rinpoche."&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche; 17 September 2003 [http://www.chronicleproject.com/stories_16.html], after [http://www.shambhala.org/teachers/chogyam-trungpa.php]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to its traditional presentation in Tibet, where the esoteric practices are largely the domain of the monastic sangha, in the US Trungpa introduced the Vajrayana to the lay sangha.&lt;ref&gt;Dead but not lost: grief narratives in religious traditions By Robert Goss, Dennis Klass; p74&lt;/ref&gt;

The presentation of these teachings gave rise to some criticism. According to Trungpa's former student Stephen Butterfield, "Trungpa told us that if we ever tried to leave the Vajrayana, we would suffer unbearable, subtle, continuous anguish, and disasters would pursue us like furies".&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield 11&lt;/ref&gt; Other Vajrayana teachers also warn their students about the dangers of the esoteric path.

Butterfield noted "disquieting resemblances" to cults, and "to be part of Trungpa's inner circle, you had to take a vow never to reveal or even discuss some of the things he did." But Butterfield also notes that "This personal secrecy is common with gurus, especially in Vajrayana Buddhism,"&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield 12, 100&lt;/ref&gt; and acknowledges that Trungpa's organization is anything but a cult: "a mere cult leaves you disgusted and disillusioned, wondering how you could have been a fool. I did not feel that charlatans had hoodwinked me into giving up my powers to enhance theirs. On the contrary, mine were unveiled."&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield 239&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meditation and education centers===
[[File:Karme chöling purkong.jpg|thumb|The purkhang at [[Karmê Chöling]]|349x349px]]
In 1973, Trungpa established [[Vajradhatu]], encompassing all his North American institutions, headquartered in [[Boulder, Colorado]]. Trungpa also founded more than 100 meditation centers throughout the world. Originally known as Dharmadhatus, these centers, now more than 150 in number, are known as [[Shambhala International|Shambhala Meditation Centers]]. He also founded retreat centers for intensive meditation practice, including [[Shambhala Mountain Center]] in [[Red Feather Lakes]], Colorado, [[Karmê Chöling]] in [[Barnet, Vermont]] and [[Gampo Abbey]] in [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]], [[Nova Scotia]].

In 1974, Trungpa founded the Naropa Institute, which later became [[Naropa University]], in [[Boulder, Colorado]].  Naropa was the first accredited [[Buddhist universities in the United States and Canada|Buddhist university]] in North America. Trungpa hired [[Allen Ginsberg]] to teach [[poetry]] and [[William Burroughs]] to teach [[literature]].

Trungpa had a number of notable students, among whom were [[Pema Chödrön]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Peter Orlovsky]], [[Anne Waldman]], [[Diane di Prima]], [[Peter Lieberson]], [[John Steinbeck IV]], [[José Argüelles]], [[David Nichtern]], [[Ken Wilber]], [[David Deida]], [[Francisco Varela]], and [[Joni Mitchell]], who portrayed Trungpa in the song "Refuge of the Roads" on her 1976 album [[Hejira (album)|Hejira]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.plos.org/neurotribes/2015/10/26/what-kind-of-buddhist-was-steve-jobs-really/|title=What Kind of Buddhist was Steve Jobs, Really?|accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ginsberg, Waldman, and di Prima also taught at Naropa University, and in the 1980s [[Marianne Faithfull]] taught songwriting workshops.
Lesser-known students Trungpa taught in England and the US include Alf Vial, [[Rigdzin Shikpo]] (né Michael Hookham), Jigme Rinzen (né P. Howard Useche), [[Ezequiel Hernandez]] Urdaneta (known as Keun-Tshen Goba after setting up his first meditation center in Venezuela), Miguel Otaola (aka [[Dorje Khandro]]), Francisco Salas Roche, and [[Francesca Fremantle]]. [[Rigdzin Shikpo]] promulgated Trungpa's teachings from a primarily [[Nyingma]] rather than Kagyü point of view at the Longchen Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.longchenfoundation.org/aboutFounder.html Longchen Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128075242/http://www.longchenfoundation.org/aboutFounder.html |date=2012-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rigdzin Shikpo 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shambhala vision===

In 1976, Trungpa began giving a series of secular teachings, some of which were gathered and presented as the [[Shambhala Training]],&lt;ref&gt;Midal 2001, pp 233–247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa 2004, Introduction to Volume 8&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by his vision (see [[terma (Buddhism)|terma]]) of the legendary Kingdom of [[Shambhala]]. Trungpa had actually started writing about Shambhala before his 1959 escape from Tibet to India, but most of those writings were lost during the escape.&lt;ref&gt;Midal 2005, pp 363–364&lt;/ref&gt;

In his view not only was individual enlightenment not mythical, but the Shambhala Kingdom, an enlightened society, could in fact be actualized. The practice of Shambhala vision is to use mindfulness/awareness meditation as a way to connect with one's [[basic goodness]] and confidence. It is presented as a path that "brings dignity, confidence, and wisdom to every facet of life." Trungpa proposed to lead the Kingdom as ''sakyong'' (Tib. earth protector) with his wife as queen-consort or ''sakyong wangmo.''

Shambhala vision is described as a nonreligious approach rooted in meditation and accessible to individuals of any, or no, religion. In Shambhala terms, it is possible, moment by moment, for individuals to establish enlightened society. His book, ''[[Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior]]'', provides a concise collection of the Shambhala views. According to Trungpa, it was his [[intention]] to propagate the [[Kings of Shambhala|kingdom of Shambala]] that provided the necessary inspiration to leave his homeland and make the arduous journey to India and the West.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shambhala.org/ntc/pdf/Chogyam-the-Translator.pdf Chogyam The Translator, see p. 4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829123015/http://www.shambhala.org/ntc/pdf/Chogyam-the-Translator.pdf |date=2008-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work with arts and sciences===

From the beginning of his time in the US, Trungpa encouraged his students to integrate a contemplative approach into their everyday activities. In addition to making a variety of traditional contemplative practices available to the community, he incorporated his students' already existing interests (especially anything relating to Japanese culture), evolving specialized teachings on a meditative approach to these various disciplines. These included [[kyūdō]] (Japanese archery), [[calligraphy]], [[ikebana]] (flower arranging), [[Sadō]] ([[Japanese tea ceremony]]), [[dance]], [[theater]], [[film]], [[poetry]], [[health care]], and [[psychotherapy]]. His aim was, in his own words, to bring "art to everyday life." He founded the [[Nalanda Foundation]] in 1974 as an umbrella organization for these activities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

===Death===
Trungpa visited [[Nova Scotia]] for the first time in 1977. In 1983 he established [[Gampo Abbey]], a Karma Kagyü monastery in Cape Breton. The following year, 1984–85, he observed a yearlong retreat at [[Mill Village, Nova Scotia|Mill Village]] and in 1986 he moved his home and Vajradhatu's international headquarters to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]].

By then he was in failing health due to the auto accident in his youth and years of heavy alcohol use. On September 28, 1986, he suffered cardiac arrest,&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, 2008, p 367&lt;/ref&gt; after which his condition deteriorated, requiring intensive care at the hospital, then at his home and finally, in mid-March 1987, back at the hospital, where he died on April 4, 1987.

In 2006 his wife, Diana Mukpo, wrote, "Although he had many of the classic health problems that develop from heavy drinking, it was in fact more likely the diabetes and high blood pressure that led to abnormal blood sugar levels and then the cardiac arrest".&lt;ref&gt;Mukpo, 2006, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; But in a November 2008 interview, when asked "What was he ill with? What did he die of?," Trungpa's doctor, Mitchell Levy, replied, "He had chronic liver disease related to his alcohol intake over many years."&lt;ref&gt;Chronicles Radio Presents. November 1st, 2008.&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.chronicleproject.com/chroniclesradio_dispatches/2008_11_01.html]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One of Trungpa's nursing attendants reported that he suffered in his last months from classic symptoms of terminal [[alcoholism]] and [[cirrhosis]],&lt;ref name="Butler17"/&gt; yet continued drinking heavily. She added, "At the same time there was a power about him and an equanimity to his presence that was phenomenal, that I don't know how to explain."&lt;ref&gt;Zweig 1991, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

Trungpa is reported to have remained in a state of [[Samādhi (Buddhism)|samādhi]] for five days after his death, his body not immediately decaying and his heart remaining warm.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, 2008, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; His body was packed in salt, laid in a wooden box, and conveyed to Karmê Chöling. A number of observers have reported that his cremation there on May 26, 1987, was accompanied by various atmospheric effects and other signs traditionally viewed as marks of enlightenment. These included the appearance of rainbows, circling eagles,&lt;ref&gt;Miles, 1989, pp. 526–528&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, 2008, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; and a cloud in the shape of an ''Ashe''.&lt;ref&gt;"Collective identity and the post-charismatic fate of Shambhala International" by Eldershaw, Lynn P., Ph.D. thesis, University of Waterloo, 2004. pg 222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Everyone who stayed long enough at Trungpa's cremation saw the rainbows." Stephen Butterfield, in ''The new Buddhism: the western transformation of an ancient tradition'' By James William Coleman; p77&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuation of the Shambhala lineage===
Upon Trungpa's death, the leadership of [[Vajradhatu]] was first carried on by his American disciple, appointed regent and Dharma heir, [[Ösel Tendzin]] (Thomas Rich), and then by Trungpa's eldest son and Shambhala heir, [[Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche]].

The next Trungpa [[tülku]], [[Chokyi Sengay]], was recognized in 1991 by [[Tai Situ]] Rinpoche.

==Acclaim==
Major lineage holders of Trungpa's Tibetan Buddhist traditions and many other Buddhist teachers supported his work.
[[File:Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche.jpg|thumb|262x262px|Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche]]
In 1974, Trungpa invited the 16th [[Karmapa]], head of the [[Karma Kagyu]] lineage, to come to the West and offer teachings. Based on this visit, the Karmapa proclaimed Trungpa one of the principal Kagyu lineage holders in the west:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ancient and renowned lineage of the Trungpas, since the great [[siddha]] Trungmase Chökyi Gyamtso Lodrö, possessor of only holy activity, has in every generation given rise to great beings. Awakened by the vision of these predecessors in the lineage, this my present lineage holder, Chökyi Gyamtso Trungpa Rinpoche, supreme incarnate being, has magnificently carried out the vajra holders' discipline in the land of America, bringing about the liberation of students and ripening them in the [[dharma]]. This wonderful truth is clearly manifest.

Accordingly, I empower Chögyam Trungpa Vajra Holder and Possessor of the Victory Banner of the Practice Lineage of the Karma Kagyu. Let this be recognized by all people of both elevated and ordinary station.&lt;ref&gt;"Proclamation to all Those Who Dwell Under the Sun Upholding the Tradition of the Spiritual and Temporal Orders", The Gyalwang Karmapa, 1974, in ''Garuda IV'', 1976, pp 86–87, {{ISBN|0-87773-086-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1981, Trungpa and his students hosted the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in his visit to Boulder, Colorado. Of Trungpa, the Dalai Lama later wrote, "Exceptional as one of the first Tibetan lamas to become fully assimilated into Western culture, he made a powerful contribution to revealing the Tibetan approach to inner peace in the West."&lt;ref&gt;Midal, 2005. p. x&lt;/ref&gt;

Trungpa also received support from one of his own main teachers, [[Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche]], head of the [[Nyingma]] lineage.  In addition to numerous [[sadhana]]s and poems dedicated to Trungpa, Khyentse Rinpoche wrote a supplication after Trungpa's death specifically naming him a [[mahasiddha]].&lt;ref&gt;Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, [http://www.chronicleproject.com/tributes/65.html Light of Blessings]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche, [http://www.chronicleproject.com/stories_33.html Reflections on Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simhas.org/chogyamtrungpa.html The Vajracarya Trungpa Rinpoche] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205081428/http://www.simhas.org/chogyamtrungpa.html |date=December 5, 2008 }}: "The 1st Trungpa Rinpoche ... was an incarnation of the Indian Mahasiddha Dombipa"&lt;/ref&gt; Among other Tibetan lamas to name Trungpa a mahasiddha are [[Rangjung Rigpe Dorje|the Sixteenth Karmapa]], [[Thrangu Rinpoche]], [[Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche]] and [[Tai Situpa]].&lt;ref&gt;Warrior-King of Shambhala: Remembering Chogyam Trungpa By Jeremy Hayward; p274&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche]] said, "As taught in the Buddhist scriptures, there are nine qualities of a perfect master of buddhadharma. The eleventh Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche possessed all nine of these."&lt;ref&gt;Midal, 2005. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suzuki Roshi]], founder of the [[San Francisco Zen Center]] and [[Tassajara Zen Mountain Center]], and another important exponent of Buddhism to western students, described Trungpa in the context of a talk about emptiness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The way you can struggle with this is to be supported by something, something you don't know. As we are human beings, there must be that kind of feeling. You must feel it in this city or building or community. So whatever community it may be, it is necessary for it to have this kind of spiritual support.

That is why I respect Trungpa Rinpoche. He is supporting us. You may criticize him because he drinks alcohol like I drink water, but that is a minor problem. He trusts you completely. He knows that if he is always supporting you in a true sense you will not criticize him, whatever he does. And he doesn't mind whatever you say. That is not the point, you know. This kind of big spirit, without clinging to some special religion or form of practice, is necessary for human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Midal, 2005. p. 381&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Gehlek Rinpoche]], who lived with Trungpa when they were young monks in India and later visited and taught with him in the U.S., remarked:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
He was a great Tibetan yogi, a friend, and a master. The more I deal with Western Dharma students, the more I appreciate how he presented the dharma and the activities that he taught. Whenever I meet with difficulties, I begin to understand – sometimes before solving the problem, sometimes afterward – why Trungpa Rinpoche did some unconventional things. I do consider him to be the father of Tibetan Buddhism in the United States. In my opinion, he left very early – too early. His death was a great loss. Everything he did is significant.&lt;ref&gt;Midal, 2005. p. 418&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Diana Mukpo, his wife, stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
First, Rinpoche always wanted feedback. He very, very much encouraged his students’ critical intelligence. One of the reasons that people were in his circle was that they were willing to be honest and direct with him. He definitely was not one of those teachers who asked for obedience and wanted their students not to think for themselves. He thrived, he lived, on the intelligence of his students. That is how he built his entire teaching situation.

From my perspective, I could always be pretty direct with him. Maybe I was not hesitant to do that because I really trusted the unconditional nature of our relationship. I felt there was really nothing to lose by being absolutely direct with him, and he appreciated that.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2998&amp;Itemid=0]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the forebears formally acknowledged by the Trungpa lineage, and referred to by Trungpa, were the Indian [[mahasiddha]] Ḍombipa&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Born in Tibet|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=33|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as Ḍombi Heruka; his name may have stemmed from his consorting with Dhombis, outcast women)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenon2.com/en/knowledge/mahasiddhas/32-mahasiddha-dombhipa%E2%80%A6-dombipa-dombip%C4%81da-dom-bhi-he-ru-ka-%E2%80%9Che-washer-folk%E2%80%9D%E2%80%9D-tiger-ride|title=Mahasiddha Dombhipa… Dombipa / Dombipāda (dom bhi he ru ka): "He of the Washer Folk"/"The Tiger Rider"|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Drukpa Kunley|Drukpa Künlek]] (also Kunley), the Mad Yogi of Bhutan, who converted Bhutan to Buddhism and was famous for his fondness for beer and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chogyam Trungpa: His Life and Vision|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=154|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Divine Madman: The Sublime Life and Songs of Drukpa Kunley|last=Dowman|first=Keith|publisher=Createspace|year=2014|isbn=1495379833|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both were recognized for their powerful but unorthodox teaching styles.

Trungpa's own teaching style was often unconventional. In his own words, "When we talk about compassion, we talk in terms of being kind. But compassion is not so much being kind; it is being creative to wake a person up."&lt;ref&gt;The Collected Works of Chögyam Trungpa, Volume Six, p. 541&lt;/ref&gt; He did not encourage his students to imitate his own behavior, and was troubled by those who felt empowered by his example to do whatever they wanted and manipulate people. As the third [[Jamgon Kongtrul|Jamgön Kongtrül]] explained to Trungpa's students, "You shouldn't imitate or judge the behavior of your teacher, Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, unless you can imitate his mind."&lt;ref&gt;Midal 2001, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

Trungpa's sexuality has been one of the sources of controversy, as he cultivated relations with a number of his female students. [[Tenzin Palmo]], who met him in 1962 while he was still at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], did not become one of his consorts, refusing his advances because he had presented himself as "a pure monk." But Palmo stated that had she known Trungpa had been having sexual relations with women since he was 13, she would not have declined.&lt;ref&gt;''Cave in the Snow: Tendzin Palmo's quest for enlightenment'' by Vicki MacKenzie. Bloomsbury: 1998 {{ISBN|1-58234-004-8}}. pg 31&lt;/ref&gt; Trungpa formally renounced his monastic vows in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;The Collected Works of Chogyam Trungpa, Volume 1. Shambhala Publications: 2004 {{ISBN|1-59030-025-4}} pg xxix&lt;/ref&gt;

Trungpa was also known for smoking tobacco and liberally using alcohol;&lt;ref&gt;Lojong and Tonglen Community Site. [http://lojongmindtraining.com/Biography.aspx?authorID=2 Biography of Chogyam Trungpa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514064434/http://lojongmindtraining.com/Biography.aspx?AuthorID=2 |date=2006-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; many who knew him characterized him as an alcoholic.&lt;ref name="Coleman74"&gt;Coleman 2001, pg. 74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="das251"&gt;Das 1997, pg. 251&lt;/ref&gt; He began drinking occasionally shortly after arriving in India.&lt;ref&gt;Mukpo 72&lt;/ref&gt; Before coming to the US, Trungpa drove a sports car into a joke shop in [[Dumfries]], Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Das 1997, pg. 199&lt;/ref&gt; While his companion was not seriously injured,&lt;ref&gt;The new Buddhism: the western transformation of an ancient tradition By James William Coleman; p75&lt;/ref&gt; Trungpa was left partially paralyzed. Later, he described this event as a pivotal moment that inspired the course of his teachings. Some accounts ascribe the accident to drinking.&lt;ref&gt;The American occupation of Tibetan Buddhism: Tibetans and their American ... By Eve Mullen; p56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zweig141"&gt;Zweig 1991, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest he may have had a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;"Following a stroke which left him partially paralyzed, Trungpa renounced his monastic vows" The A to Z of Buddhism – Page 258 by Charles S. Prebish&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dharmafellowship.org/biographies/contemporarymasters/chogyam-trungpa.htm The Dharma Fellowship]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Trungpa himself, he blacked out.&lt;ref&gt;Warrior-King of Shambhala: Remembering Chogyam Trungpa By Jeremy Hayward; p10&lt;/ref&gt;

Trungpa often combined drinking with teaching. David Chadwick recounts:&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick 1999, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Suzuki [Roshi] asked Trungpa to give a talk to the students in the [[zendo]] the next night. Trungpa walked in tipsy and sat on the edge of the altar platform with his feet dangling. But he delivered a crystal-clear talk, which some felt had a quality – like Suzuki's talks – of not only being about the dharma but being itself the dharma.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In some instances Trungpa was too drunk to walk and had to be carried.&lt;ref name="Zweig141" /&gt; Also, according to his student [[John Steinbeck IV]] and his wife, on a couple of occasions Trungpa's speech was unintelligible.&lt;ref name="Steinbeck176_248"&gt;Steinbeck 2001, pp. 176, 248&lt;/ref&gt; One woman reported serving him "big glasses of gin first thing in the morning."&lt;ref name="Butler17"&gt;Butler, Katy. ''Encountering the Shadow in Buddhist America'' in ''Common Boundary'' May/June 1990. pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The Steinbecks wrote ''The Other Side of Eden'', a sharply critical memoir of their lives with Trungpa in which they claim that, in addition to alcohol, he spent $40,000 a year on [[cocaine]], and used [[Seconal]] to come down from the cocaine. The Steinbecks said the cocaine use was kept secret from the wider Vajradhatu community.&lt;ref&gt;Steinbeck 2001, pp. 32, 41, 266&lt;/ref&gt;

An incident that became a [[cause célèbre]] among some poets and artists was the Halloween party at Snowmass Colorado Seminary in 1975, held during a 3-month period of intensive meditation and study of the [[Hinayana]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]] vehicles of Tibetan Buddhism. The poet [[W. S. Merwin]] had arrived at the [[Naropa University|Naropa Institute]] that summer and been told by [[Allen Ginsberg]] that he ought to attend the seminary. Although he had not gone through the several years' worth of study and preparatory mind training required, Merwin insisted on attending and Trungpa eventually granted his request – along with Merwin's girlfriend. At seminary the couple kept to themselves. At the Halloween party, after many, including Trungpa himself, had taken off their clothes, Merwin was asked to join the event but refused. On Trungpa's orders, his Vajra Guard forced entry into the poet's locked and barricaded room; brought him and his girlfriend, Dana Naone, against their will, to the party; and eventually stripped them of all their clothes, with onlookers ignoring Naone's pleas for help and for someone to call the police.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, 1977, throughout; Miles 1989, pp. 466–470; and Clark 1980, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; The next day Trungpa asked Merwin and Naone to remain at the Seminary as either students or guests. They agreed to stay for several more weeks to hear the Vajrayana teachings, with Trungpa's promise that "there would be no more incidents" and Merwin's that there would be "no guarantees of obedience, trust, or personal devotion to him."&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, 1977, pp. 56, 88&lt;/ref&gt; They left immediately after the last talk. In a 1977 letter to members of a Naropa class investigating the incident, Merwin concluded,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
My feelings about Trungpa have been mixed from the start.  Admiration, throughout, for his remarkable gifts; and reservations, which developed into profound misgivings, concerning some of his uses of them.  I imagine, at least, that I've learned some things from him (though maybe not all of them were the things I was "supposed" to learn) and some through him, and I'm grateful to him for those.  I wouldn't encourage anyone to become a student of his. I wish him well.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, 1977, pg. 89&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The incident became known to a wider public when Tom Clark published "The Great Naropa Poetry Wars". The Naropa Institute later asked [[Ed Sanders]] and his class to conduct an internal investigation, resulting in a lengthy report.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marin (1979) p43-58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanders (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kashner (2004) p. 278ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weinberger (1986) pp 30-33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eliot Weinberger]] commented on the incident in a critique aimed at Trungpa and [[Allen Ginsberg]] published in ''[[The Nation]]'' on April 19, 1980. He complained that the fascination of some of the best minds of his generation with Trungpa's presentation of Tibetan Buddhism and Tibetan theocracy created a dangerous exclusivity and elitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadmuseditions.com/Naropa.html|title=Cadmus Editions on Clark's publication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Jeffery Paine]] commented on this incident that "[s]eeing Merwin out of step with the rest, Trungpa could have asked him to leave, but decided it was kinder to shock him out of his aloofness."&lt;ref&gt;Paine (2004) pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; Paine also noted the outrage felt in particular by poets such as [[Robert Bly]] and [[Kenneth Rexroth]], who began calling Trungpa a [[fascism|fascist]].&lt;ref&gt;Paine (2004) pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Trungpa's choice of Westerner [[Ösel Tendzin]] as his dharma heir was controversial, as Tendzin was the first Western Tibetan Buddhist lineage holder and Vajra Regent. This was exacerbated by Tendzin's own behavior as lineage holder. While knowingly [[HIV]]-positive, Tendzin was sexually involved with students, one of whom became infected and died.&lt;ref&gt;Fields 1992, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Contemporary Art Society''' is an organisation founded to encourage the awareness and appreciation of [[contemporary art]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Using money donated by its friends and supporters, it purchases works of art which it then donates to public museums and galleries.

==Background==
Founded in 1910, the Contemporary Art Society has since then donated over 8,000 works to galleries and museums, including works by [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Lucien Freud]], [[Barbara Hepworth]] and [[Henry Moore]].&lt;ref name=CAS_01&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.contemporaryartsociety.org/about/|work=Contemporary Art Society|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAS enabled the donation of the ''Musgrave Kinley Outsider Art Collection'' (formed by [[Victor Musgrave]] and [[Monika Kinley]]) of about 800 works to the [[Whitworth Art Gallery]], University of Manchester, previously on loan for ten years at the [[Irish Museum of Modern Art]] (IMMA) in Dublin.&lt;ref name=CAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Musgrave Kinley Outsider Art Collection|url=http://www.contemporaryartsociety.org/list-of-works/musgrave-kinley-outsider-art-collection/|work=Contemporary Art Society|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Contemporary Art Society received funding from [[Arts Council England]] towards its core costs; in 2014-2015 this amounted to £175,655.&lt;ref name=AC&gt;{{cite web|title=Contemporary Art Society|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/browse-regularly-funded-organisations/npo/contemporary-art-society/|work=Arts Council|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Delta of Venus''''' is a book of fifteen [[short stories]] by [[Anaïs Nin]] published [[List of works published posthumously|posthumously]] in 1977&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby, ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 683&lt;/ref&gt; — though largely written in the 1940s as [[erotica]] for a private [[book collector|collector]].&lt;ref&gt;Anaïs Nin, ''Delta of Venus &amp; Little Birds'' (1996), pp. 13–16&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 [[Delta of Venus (film)|a film inspired by the book]] was directed by [[Zalman King]].

==Background==
The collection of short stories that makes up this anthology was written during the 1940s for a private client known simply as "Collector". This "Collector" commissioned Nin, along with other now well-known writers (including [[Henry Miller]] and the poet [[George Barker (poet)|George Barker]]), to produce erotic fiction for his private consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Anaïs Nin, ''Delta of Venus &amp; Little Birds'' (1996), pp. 13–16&lt;/ref&gt; His identity has since been revealed as Roy M. Johnson of Healdton Oil, Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Herron, ''Anaïs Nin:A Book of Mirrors'' (Sky Blue Press, 1996), p.427&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being told to leave poetic language aside and concentrate on graphic, sexually explicit scenarios, Nin was able to give these stories a literary flourish and a layer of images and ideas beyond the pornographic. In her Diary (Oct. 1941), she jokingly referred to herself as "the madam of this snobbish literary house of prostitution, from which vulgarity was excluded".&lt;ref&gt;* Anaïs Nin, ''Delta of Venus &amp; Little Birds'' (1996), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

While using the [[Kama Sutra]] and other writings such as those of [[Krafft-Ebing]] as models, Nin was very conscious that the languages of male and female sexuality were distinct.&lt;ref&gt;Anaïs Nin, ''Delta of Venus &amp; Little Birds'' (1996), pp. 15 &amp; 19&lt;/ref&gt; Although at times she scorned her erotica, and feared for their impact on her literary reputation,&lt;ref&gt;Anne T. Salvatore, ''Anaïs Nin's Narratives'', [[University Press of Florida]] (2001) {{ISBN|0-8130-2113-8}}, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; they have subsequently been seen by [[Sex-positive feminism|sex-positive feminists]] as pioneering work.&lt;ref&gt;Susie Bright, ''Totally Heterotica'' (1995), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short stories==
The short stories which ''Delta of Venus'' anthologizes are these:
# The Hungarian Adventurer
# Mathilde
# The Boarding School
# The Ring
# Mallorca
# Artists and Models
# Lilith
# Marianne
# The Veiled Woman
# Elena
# The Basque and Bijou
# Pierre
# Manuel
# Linda
# Marcel
The book, unlike the later ''[[Little Birds]],'' contains no poetry as such. Its introductory preface contains entries from her [[The Diary of Anaïs Nin|''Diary'']], which expressed her hope that its unexpurgated version would one day be published.

'''''{{Lang|de|Der Kaiser von Atlantis oder Die Tod-Verweigerung}}''''' (''The Emperor of Atlantis or The Disobedience of Death'') is a one-act [[opera]] by [[Viktor Ullmann]] with a [[libretto]] by [[Peter Kien]]. They collaborated on the work while interned in the [[Nazi]] concentration camp of [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]] (Terezín) around 1943. The Nazis did not allow it to be performed there.

The world premiere, presented by the [[De Nederlandse Opera|Netherlands Opera]] at the Bellevue Centre, [[Amsterdam]], took place on 16 December 1975. It was conducted by Kerry Woodward using the first performing edition, which he had been actively involved in preparing.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh R.N. Macdonald, "''Der Kaiser von Atlantis''", ''Tempo'' (New Ser.), 116 (1976), 42–3&lt;/ref&gt;

The title is sometimes given as ''{{Lang|de|Der Kaiser von Atlantis, oder Der Tod dankt ab}}'', that is, ''The Emperor of Atlantis, or Death Abdicates'',{{sfn|Karas|1990|p=33}} and described as a "legend in four scenes" rather than an opera.

==Composition history==
About 1943, Ullmann and Kien were inmates at the [[Nazi]] concentration camp of [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]] (Terezín) when they collaborated on the opera.&lt;ref name=Kozinn&gt;[[Allan Kozinn]], [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/24/arts/opera-review-born-in-the-camps-and-still-kicking.html "Born in the Camps And Still Kicking"], ''The New York Times'', 24 November 1994&lt;/ref&gt; It was rehearsed at Theresienstadt in March 1944, but the Nazi authorities interpreted the work's depiction of the character of the [[Kaiser]] as a satire on [[Adolf Hitler]] and did not allow it to be performed.&lt;ref name="Jewish Renaissance"&gt;{{cite journal | title=When Death Went on Strike | author=Michael Haas | journal=[[Jewish Renaissance]] |date=October 2012 | volume=12 | issue=1 | pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the composer and the librettist died in the [[Auschwitz]] concentration camp.

Ullmann entrusted his manuscripts to a fellow-prisoner, Dr. Emil Utitz, a former Professor of Philosophy at the [[Charles University in Prague|German University in Prague]], who served as the camp's librarian. Utitz survived the camp and passed the manuscripts on to another survivor, Dr. Hans Gunther Adler, a friend of Ullmann's, some of whose poems Ullmann had set to music. The score was a working version with edits, substitutions, and alternatives made in the course of rehearsals. Dr. Adler deposited the original manuscripts and two copies of the libretto in his possession at the [[Goetheanum]] in [[Dornach]],&lt;ref name=Graubart /&gt; the center for the [[anthroposophical]] movement with which Ullmann was associated. The manuscripts subsequently passed to the Paul Sacher Stiftung in Basle.

==Performance history==
'''First performing edition'''

Through informal personal connections, the score came to the attention of conductor Kerry Woodward. In the process of preparing a performing edition of the score, Woodward consulted [[Rosemary Brown (spiritualist)|Rosemary Brown]], who was a prominent spiritualist, known for [[mediumship]] with dead composers and for transcribing musical works they dictated. She said she contacted Ullmann and communicated his instructions to Woodward, who incorporated them into his edition. At Brown's direction, Woodward altered the instrumentation of the second part of Death's aria near the end of the opera, substituting strings for harpsichord and adding trumpet and flute.&lt;ref name=Graubart&gt;Michael Graubart, "''The Emperor of Atlantis'': The First British Production", ''Musical Times'', Autumn 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The world premiere was presented by the [[Dutch National Opera]] (DNO) on 16 December 1975 at the {{ill|Theater Bellevue|nl}} in [[Amsterdam]]. In 1976 DNO presented two performances in Brussels and a further four in Spoleto.&lt;ref name=Schonberg&gt;[[Harold C. Schonberg]], [https://www.nytimes.com/1976/06/28/archives/the-opera-two-oneacters-are-sung-in-spoleto-paolino-by-tedeschi-has.html "Two One-Acters Are Sung in Spoleto,"] ''The New York Times'', 28 June 1976, accessed 29 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It was recreated in April 1977 by the San Francisco Spring Opera Theater for its American premiere,&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'' (London), 26 April 1977&lt;/ref&gt; and the same group also presented the New York premiere at the Lepercq Space at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] on 19 May 1977. DNO revived their production in Amsterdam in June 1978 and later that year presented five performances in Israel. In 1979 DNO presented two performances at the Nottingham Playhouse, England. All of these performances were conducted by Woodward.&lt;ref name=Porter&gt;Andrew Porter, "A Lecture and a Parable", ''The New Yorker'' 6 June 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rockwell&gt;John Rockwell,[https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/21/archives/new-opera-theater-offering-work-of-argento-and-ullmann.html "New Opera Theater Offering Work of Argento and Ullmann,"] ''The New York Times'', 21 May 1977, accessed 29 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Other performing editions and performances'''

In 1981, Michael Graubart and Nicholas Till prepared an edition based on the manuscripts in Dr. Adler's possession as well as on Woodward's edition, following many of Woodward's choices but preferring the 1943 text to the changes made on the basis of Brown's contribution. That provided the basis for the British premiere at the Studio Theatre of London's [[Morley College]] on 15 May 1981 and for additional performances in May 1985 at the [[Imperial War Museum]].&lt;ref name=Graubart/&gt;

Ingo Schultz worked on the reconstruction of the opera's score between 1992 and 1993 in cooperation with [[Karel Berman]], who rehearsed the role of Death at Terezín, [[Paul Kling]], who was the concertmaster of the chamber-orchestra of the rehearsals at Terezin 1944, and [[Herbert Thomas Mandl]]. [[ARBOS – Company for Music and Theatre|ARBOS – Gesellschaft für Musik und Theater]] (Austria) staged this edition of the opera in Austria, the Czech Republic (including the first performance at the concentration camp of Theresienstadt in 1995), Germany, Sweden, Canada, and the U.S. (including a performance at the [[U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum]]).

[[Tomasz Konina]] directed Polish prapremiere at [[Warsaw Chamber Opera]] in [[Warsaw]] in 2005.

==Critical appreciation==
Descriptions and summaries of Kien's libretto vary widely. [[John Rockwell]] described the opera as a story of "the abdication of death in the face of life's universal horrors."&lt;ref name=Rockwell /&gt; [[Harold C. Schonberg|Harold Schonberg]] thought that "the play is stronger and more interesting than the music....In several spots the Ullmann work almost makes it as an opera."&lt;ref name=Schonberg /&gt; Most summaries report that Death insists that the Emperor be the first to die, but others emphasize the ending in which "miraculously, the Emperor comes to understand his crimes" and "to allow Death to save millions from the agony of life-without-death, he offers himself as Death's first victim."&lt;ref name=Schiff&gt;David Schiff, [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/23/arts/music-a-musical-postcard-from-the-eye-of-the-nazi-storm.html "A Musical Postcard From the Eye of the Nazi Storm,"] ''The New York Times'', 23 March 2003, accessed 29 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, conductor [[James Conlon]], a prominent reviver of works lost in the Holocaust, described the opera as both a political satire and a parable of hope in which the isolated Emperor represents Hitler and the Drummer his confidante Eva Braun. The young lovers and Pierrot embody "the lost world of normal human emotion."&lt;ref name=Schiff /&gt;

Andrew Porter has described the text of the opera:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The plot is no cut-and-dried allegory but an elusive death-welcoming parable about a mad, murderous ruler, possibly redeemed at last, who says farewell to the world in a mock-Faustian vision of a natural paradise no longer spoiled by men; had his dream come true all men would be dead. The Emperor of Atlantis, ruler over much of the world, proclaims universal war and declares that his old ally Death will lead the campaign. Death, offended by the Emperor's presumption, breaks his sabre; henceforth men will not die. Confusion results: a Soldier and a Girl-Soldier from opposite sides sing a love duet instead of fighting; the sick and suffering find no release. Death offers to return to men on one condition&amp;ndash;that the Emperor be the first to die. He accepts and sings his farewell.&lt;ref name=Porter /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Synopsis==
'''Prologue'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.longbeachopera.org/index.php/2009-season/emperor-of-atlantis-clever-one "Synopsis: ''The Emperor of Atlantis''"], Long Beach Opera production, 2009, accessed 29 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A voice heard over a loudspeaker sets the scene and presents the characters.

'''Scene 1'''

Harlequin describes his sorry life without laughter or love. Death joins him and together they lament how slowly time passes in their grim environment.
Death belittles Harlequin's wish to die and explains how much more dire his own situation is than that of Harlequin. He lacks respect now that the "old-fashioned craft of dying" has been replaced by "motorized chariots of war" that work him to exhaustion with little satisfaction.

The Drummer announces the latest decree of the Emperor: Everyone will be armed and everyone will fight until there are no survivors. Death denounces the Emperor for usurping his role: "To take men's souls is my job, not his!" He declares that he is on strike and breaks his saber.

'''Scene 2'''

In his palace, the Emperor gives battle orders and monitors the progress of the universal war. He learns of a man who continues to live eighty minutes after being hanged and shot. The Loudspeaker reports that thousands of soldiers are "wrestling with life...doing their best to die" without success. Fearful that his power will not endure without death, the Emperor announces that he has decided to reward his subjects with the gift of eternal life. More honestly, he asks: "Death, where is thy sting? Where is thy victory, Hell?"

'''Scene 3'''

A Soldier and a Maiden (the Bobbed-Hair Girl) confront one another as enemies. Unable to kill each other, their thoughts turn to love. They dream of distant places where kind words exist alongside "meadows filled with color and fragrance." The Drummer attempts to lure them back to battle with the sensual attraction of the call. The Maiden responds: "Now death is dead and so we need to fight no more!" She and the Soldier sing: "Only love can unite us, unite us all together."

'''Scene 4'''

The Emperor continues to oversee his failing realm, where his subjects angrily protest their suspension in limbo between life and death. Harlequin appeals to him, reminding him of his innocent childhood. The Drummer urges the Emperor to maintain his resolve, but the Emperor's memories turn his thoughts from his plans for the annihilation of all. Instead he gazes into a covered mirror and asks: "What do men look like? Am I still a man or just the adding machine of God?"

He pulls away the mirror's cloth and faces the reflection of Death. "Who are you?" he demands. Death describes his role modestly, like that of a gardener "who roots up wilting weeds, life's worn-out fellows." He regrets the pain his strike is causing. When the Emperor asks him to resume his duties, Death proposes a resolution to the crisis: "I'm prepared to make peace, if you are prepared to make a sacrifice: will you be the first one to try out the new death?" After some resistance, the Emperor agrees and the suffering people find release in death once more. The Emperor sings his farewell. In a closing chorus, Death is praised and asked to "teach us to keep your holiest law: Thou shalt not use the name of Death in vain now and forever!"

==Music==
The score comprises 20 short sections and lasts about fifty minutes.&lt;ref name=Porter /&gt; Parts of it are danced and there are long spoken sections.&lt;ref name=Tommasini&gt;[[Anthony Tommasini]], [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/19/arts/opera-review-from-the-doomed-an-ode-to-life-and-a-warning-not-to-insult-death.html "From the Doomed, an Ode to Life And a Warning Not to Insult Death,"] ''The New York Times'', 19 September 1998, accessed 29 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1943 orchestration is for chamber ensemble and includes such unusual instruments as banjo and harmonium. Alto saxophone and harpsichord also appear. Ullmann used the famous [[Lutheran chorale]] "[[A Mighty Fortress Is Our God|Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott]]" as a melodic motif as well as a theme from the ''Asrael'' symphony of [[Josef Suk (composer)|Josef Suk]]. Critics list among Ullmann's antecedents and influences "the radical young Hindemith"&lt;ref name=Tommasini/&gt; as well as [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. One critic has said Ullmann employed "an omnivorous musical language that draws on both classical and popular styles."&lt;ref name=Kozinn /&gt; The work ends with the chorale to the text "Come, Death, who art our worthy guest."&lt;ref name=Porter /&gt;

The character of Harlequin is sometimes called Pierrot, a different character from the [[commedia dell'arte]]. The classic [[Pierrot]] is moonstruck and a sleepwalker. In the opera, this character is an old man who twice recites poems Kien had written earlier. The first describes a cold and pitiless moon, establishing his identity as Pierrot. Later he sings a lullaby that uses a text Kien wrote as a paraphrase of another lullaby text, one familiar to all his contemporaries in the camp, that had been sung during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Ullmann set it to a catchy melody composed by [[Johann Friedrich Reichardt]] in 1781.&lt;ref name=Kaufmann&gt;Jacobo Kaufmann, [http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=3076 "''The Emperor of Atlantis'' in Terezin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413231157/http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=3076 |date=2013-04-13 }}, ''All About Jewish Theater'' on jewish-theatre.com.

'''''Do the Right Thing''''' is a 1989 American [[comedy-drama]] film  produced, written, and directed by [[Spike Lee]]. It stars Lee and [[Danny Aiello]], [[Ossie Davis]], [[Ruby Dee]], [[Richard Edson]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]], [[Bill Nunn]], [[John Turturro]], and [[Samuel L. Jackson]], and is the feature film debut of [[Martin Lawrence]] and [[Rosie Perez]]. The story follows a Brooklyn neighborhood's simmering racial tension, which culminates in tragedy on a hot summer day.

The film was a commercial success and received numerous accolades, including [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Aiello's portrayal of Sal the pizzeria owner. It is often listed among the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films of all time]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afi.com/100years/movies10.aspx "AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)"].

==Plot==
Mookie ([[Spike Lee]]) is a 25-year-old delivery man living in [[Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn]] with his sister Jade ([[Joie Lee]]). He and his girlfriend Tina ([[Rosie Perez]]) have a toddler son named Hector (Travell Toulson). He works at the local pizzeria, but lacks ambition. Sal ([[Danny Aiello]]), the pizzeria's [[Italian-American]] owner, has been in the neighborhood for 25 years. His older son Pino ([[John Turturro]]) intensely dislikes blacks, and does not get along with Mookie. Because of this, Pino is at odds with both his father, who refuses to leave the increasingly [[African-American neighborhood]], and his younger brother Vito ([[Richard Edson]]), who is friendly with Mookie.

The neighborhood is full of distinct personalities, including Da Mayor ([[Ossie Davis]]), a friendly drunk; Mother Sister ([[Ruby Dee]]), who watches the neighborhood from her [[brownstone]]; Radio Raheem ([[Bill Nunn]]), who blasts [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] on his [[boombox]] wherever he goes; and Smiley ([[Roger Guenveur Smith]]), a [[mentally disabled]] man, who meanders around the neighborhood trying to sell hand-colored pictures of [[Malcolm X]] and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]

While at Sal's, Mookie's trouble-making [[Breakdancing|b-boyish]] friend Buggin' Out ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]) questions Sal about his "Wall of Fame", a wall decorated with photos of famous Italian-Americans. Buggin' Out demands that Sal put up pictures of black celebrities since Sal's pizzeria is in a black neighborhood. Sal replies that it is his business, and that he can have whomever he wants on "The Wall of Fame". Buggin' Out attempts to start a protest over the Wall of Fame. Only Radio Raheem and Smiley support him.

During the day, the heat and tensions begin to rise. The local teenagers open a fire hydrant and douse the street, before police officers intervene. Mookie and Pino begin arguing over race. Mookie confronts Pino about his negative attitudes towards African Americans, even though his favorite celebrities are black. Various characters then spew flowery racial insults into the camera: Mookie against Italians, Pino against African Americans, Latino Stevie ([[Luis Antonio Ramos]]) against Koreans, white police officer Gary Long (Rick Aiello) against Puerto Ricans, and Korean store owner Sonny ([[Steve Park (comedian)|Steve Park]]) against Jews. Pino and Sal talk about the neighborhood, with Pino expressing his contempt for African-Americans, and Sal insisting that he is not leaving. Sal almost fires Mookie, but Jade intervenes, before Mookie confronts her for being too close to Sal.

That night, Buggin' Out, Radio Raheem, and Smiley march into Sal's and demand that Sal change the Wall of Fame. Raheem's boombox is blaring and Sal demands that he turn it off, but he refuses. Buggin' Out calls Sal and sons "guineas", threatening to close down the pizzeria until they change the Wall of Fame. Sal, in a fit of frustration and after being called a guinea bastard, calls him a "[[nigger]]" and destroys the boombox with a [[baseball bat]]. Raheem attacks Sal, leading to a violent fight that spills out into the street, attracting a crowd. While Radio Raheem is choking Sal, the police arrive. They break up the fight and apprehend Radio Raheem and Buggin' Out. Despite the pleas of his fellow officers and the onlookers, one officer refuses to release his chokehold on Raheem, killing him. Realizing that Raheem has been killed in front of onlookers, the officers place his body in the back of a [[Police car|squad car]] and drive off, leaving Sal, Pino, and Vito unprotected.

The onlookers, enraged about Radio Raheem's death, blame Sal and his sons. Mookie grabs a trash can and throws it through the window of Sal's pizzeria, sparking the crowd to rush into the restaurant and destroy it, with Smiley finally setting it on fire, what actually diverts revenge away from Sal himself. Da Mayor pulls Sal, Pino, and Vito out of the mob's way. Firemen and riot patrols arrive to put out the fire and disperse the crowd. After police issue a warning, the firefighters turn their hoses on the rioters, leading to more fighting and arrests. Mookie and Jade sit on the curb, watching in disbelief. Smiley wanders back into the smoldering building and hangs one of his pictures on what is left of Sal's Wall of Fame.

The next day, after an argument with Tina, Mookie returns to Sal, who feels that Mookie betrayed him. Mookie demands his weekly pay, leading to an argument. They cautiously reconcile, and Sal finally pays Mookie. Mister Señor Love Daddy ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]), a local DJ, dedicates a song to Raheem.

The film ends with two quotations expressing different views about violence, one from Martin Luther King and one from Malcolm X, before fading to a photograph of them shaking hands. Prior to the credits, Lee dedicates the film to the families of six victims of police brutality: [[Eleanor Bumpurs]], [[Michael Griffith (manslaughter victim)|Michael Griffith]], Arthur Miller, Jr., [[Edmund Perry]], Yvonne Smallwood, and [[Death of Michael Stewart|Michael Stewart]].

==Production==
Spike Lee first got the idea for the film after watching the ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' episode "Shopping for Death" where the main characters discuss their theory that hot weather increases violent tendencies. He was also inspired by the [[Howard Beach racial incident]] and the [[shooting of Eleanor Bumpurs]].&lt;ref name=ew&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staskiewicz|first1=Keith|title=Do the Right Thing: 1989|work=Entertainment Weekly|issue=1282/1283|date=October 25, 2013|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee wrote the screenplay in two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/fight-the-power-spike-lee-on-do-the-right-thing-20140620 |title= Fight the Power: Spike Lee on 'Do the Right Thing' |publisher= ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' |author= Gavin Edwards |date= 20 June 2014  |access-date= 29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original script of ''Do the Right Thing'' ends with a stronger reconciliation between Mookie and Sal. Sal's comments to Mookie mirror Da Mayor's earlier comments in the film and hint at some common ground and perhaps Sal's understanding of why Mookie was motivated to destroy his restaurant. It is unclear why Lee changed the ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/d/do-the-right-thing-script.html |title='Do the Right Thing' Script (Archived) |publisher=Script-O-Rama |date=28 April 2007 |access-date=29 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428033003/http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/d/do-the-right-thing-script.html |archivedate=April 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===

Spike Lee campaigned for [[Robert De Niro]] as Sal the pizzeria owner, but De Niro had to decline due to prior commitments. Actor Danny Aiello eventually played Sal and his real-life son Rick Aiello played Gary Long, the police officer who kills Radio Raheem. The character of Smiley was not in the original script; he was created by [[Roger Guenveur Smith]], who was pestering Spike Lee for a role in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Do The Right Thing DVD Audio Commentary&lt;/ref&gt; Four of the cast members were stand-up comedians: [[Martin Lawrence]], [[Steve Park (comedian)|Steve Park]], [[Steve White (actor)|Steve White]], and [[Robin Harris]]. Lee originally wanted Bill Nunn to play the role of Mister Señor Love Daddy, but later recast him as Radio Raheem. Real-life husband and wife Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee were friends of Spike Lee's father [[Bill Lee (musician)|Bill Lee]] and were cast as Mother Sister and Da Mayor.&lt;ref name=ew/&gt; Rosie Perez was cast as Mookie's love interest Tina after Lee saw her dancing at a Los Angeles dance club. Perez decided to take the part because her sister lived four blocks from the set; however, she had never been in a film before and grew upset during the filming of Radio Raheem's death scene.&lt;ref name=ew/&gt;

===Filming===

The film was shot entirely on Stuyvesant Avenue between Quincy Street and Lexington Avenue in the [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]]. The street's color scheme was heavily altered by the production designer, who used a great deal of red and orange paint in order to help convey the sense of a heatwave. The Korean grocery store and Sal's pizzeria were built from scratch on two empty lots. The pizzeria was fully functional and the actors actually cooked pizzas in the ovens. During filming, the neighborhood's crack dealers threatened the film crew for disturbing their business so Lee hired [[Fruit of Islam]] members to provide security.&lt;ref name=ew/&gt; Samuel L. Jackson later revealed that he spent most of his time on set sleeping as he has no scenes outside.&lt;ref name=ew/&gt;

==Controversies==
The film was released to protests from many reviewers, and it was openly stated in several newspapers that the film could incite black audiences to riot.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Joe. "Spiked?" New York June 26, 1989: 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Lee criticized white reviewers for implying that black audiences were incapable of restraining themselves while watching a fictional motion picture.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;'Spike Lee's Last Word', special feature on the [[Criterion Collection]] DVD (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 interview Lee stated "That still bugs the shit out of me," calling the remarks "outrageous, egregious and, I think, racist," and further elaborating, "I don't remember people saying people were going to come out of theatres killing people after they watched Arnold Schwarzenegger films." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Gavin|title=Fight the Power: Spike Lee on 'Do the Right Thing'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/fight-the-power-spike-lee-on-do-the-right-thing-20140620|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of many questions at the end of the film is whether Mookie "does the right thing" when he throws the garbage can through the window, thus inciting the riot that destroys Sal's pizzeria. Critics have seen Mookie's action both as an action that saves Sal's life, by redirecting the crowd's anger away from Sal to his property, and as an "irresponsible encouragement to enact violence".&lt;ref name="Reid1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark A. Reid|title=Spike Lee's Do the right thing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TyQdbk7CGtUC&amp;pg=PA43|accessdate=September 25, 2010|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-55954-6|pages=43–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question is directly raised by the contradictory quotations that end the film, one advocating nonviolence, the other advocating violent self-defense in response to oppression.&lt;ref name="Reid1997" /&gt;

Spike Lee has remarked that he has only ever been asked by white viewers whether Mookie did the right thing; black viewers do not ask the question.&lt;ref&gt;''Do The Right Thing'' DVD, Director's commentary&lt;/ref&gt; Lee believes the key point is that Mookie was angry at the death of Radio Raheem, and that viewers who question the riot's justification are implicitly failing to see the difference between property and the life of a black man.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

In June 2006, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine placed ''Do the Right Thing'' at No. 22 on its list of The 25 Most Controversial Movies Ever.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141009035251/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1202224,00.html "The 25 Most Controversial Movies Ever,"] ''Entertainment Weekly'' (Retrieved 9 Apr 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

''E.S.P.'' is a [[computer and video game|game]] giving players the opportunity to find out whether they possess [[extrasensory perception]]. While displaying a constantly changing graphic design on the screen, the program briefly flashes emotionally charged words, randomly chosen from a word list, on the screen.  The program then asks a series of questions to determine if the player's attitudes have been influenced by the subliminal messages.  A file-builder is included to allow players to insert new words in the data base.

The program was offered in both a stand-alone [[Floppy disk#The 5.BC-inch minifloppy|disk]] version and a compendium, along with ''E.S.P.'' and ''Zintar'', called Party-Pak I.  However, Edu-Ware dropped the game from its product line by the time its August 1, 1980 catalog was issued.

''Perception'' is a [[puzzle game]] consisting of three [[Video game|games]] designed to challenge and improve players' [[visual perception|visual skills]]. The first involves using [[Paddle (game controller)|game paddles]] to draw lines matching those drawn by the computer.  The second, based on a [[World War II]] test for [[spy]] candidates, tests players' power of observation by showing them only small glimpses of an [[abstract object]] as a narrow mask travels over it and then asking them to choose from among several objects what they had just seen.  The third modules tests player's visual memory by requiring them to distinguish sizes of identical shapes.  Players have control over the shape, display time, and presentation format.

Originally developed by Steffin before founding Edu-Ware, he wrote a second version of the program soon after establishing the [[Video game publisher|publishing company]]. The program was offered as both a stand-alone versions, and in a compendium, along with ''Statistics'' and ''[[Compu-Read]]'', called Edu-Pak I. Edu-Ware upgraded the program to high respolution graphics using its EWS3 graphics engine in [[1982 in video gaming|1982]], renaming it ''Perception 3.0'', which was featured in the company's catalogs until [[1984 in video gaming|1984]].

Edu-Ware described it as being "more than just a [[Mad Libs|mad-libs]] game" because it described and made use of all parts of speech.&lt;ref name="August80Catalog"&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Product Catalog |date=August 1, 1980 |publisher=Edu-Ware Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Subliminal'' is a [[computer and video game|game]] testing whether players are influenced by [[subliminal messages]]. While the player is watching a constantly changing graphic design, the program quickly flashes an emotionally changed word on the screen.  The player then answers a series of questions to determine whether his attitudes has been affected by the subliminal message.  The program includes a file builder for modifying the data base from which the program randomly chooses the words to display.

The program was offered in both [[Floppy disk#The 5.BC-inch minifloppy|disk]] and [[Cassette tape|cassette]] stand-alone versions, as well as in a compendium, along with ''Zintar'', called Party-Pak I.  However, Edu-Ware dropped the game from its product line by the time its August 1, 1980 catalog was issued.

''War'' is a numeric [[strategy game]] occurring in ten rounds.  In each round, the program would display a number on the screen and allow the player to type another number in response.  The program would then use both numbers in a formula to determine the winner for that round, and the side that won the most number of rounds would win the game.  The challenge for the player was to determine the formula the program was using to determine the winner in each round.

The program was offered in both [[Floppy disk#The 5.BC-inch minifloppy|disk]] and [[Cassette tape|cassette]] stand-alone versions, as well as in a compendium, along with ''Rescue'', called Rescue/War, but was dropped from Edu-Ware's product line by the time its March 1, 1980 catalog was issued.

''Zintar'' is a [[drinking game]] in which players are instructed by the computer (randomly) to "take hits" while watching a series of color and black &amp; white graphics.  A scoreboard kept track and designated the player who had been assigned the most hits as "The Mayor". It was Pederson's first Apple II program written strictly for fun; Sherwin Steffin supplied the graphics. Edu-Ware offered it for sale after being encouraged by an early mail order distributor. This controversial [[party game]] was advertised in Edu-Ware's catalogs as being banned by [[Apple II]] retailer [[Rainbow Computing]].  However, Edu-Ware dropped the game from its product line by the time its August 1, 1980 catalog was issued.

The '''European Film Gateway''' (EFG) is a single access point to the digitized holdings of historical European film documents from numerous film archives and cinematheques, including over 600,000 individual objects from over 60 collections.&lt;ref&gt;July, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The European Film Gateway gives access to images, textual materials, and moving images. The vast contents include film stills, set photos, posters, set drawings, portrait photographs, scripts, correspondences, film censorship and visa rulings, out-of-print books, film programs and reviews, as well as newsreels, documentaries, commercials, and feature films. The portal facilitates access to the archives which hold the original materials.

==Background==
The online portal European Film Gateway is the main outcome of the EU-funded project “EFG – European Film Gateway”. Working with 22 partner organizations from 16 European countries, EFG addressed issues for access to digital content, namely, technical and semantic interoperability, metadata standards, practices for rights’ clearance, and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) management of cinematographic works. The project was coordinated by the [[Deutsches Filminstitut]] (DIF) and funded by the European Commission under eContentplus, the Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme (ICT PSP). It ran from September 2008 to August 2011 was supported by the Association des Cinematheques Europeennes (ACE) as well as the EDL Foundation.

==Key issues==

===Technical interoperability and access===
All metadata provided by the contributing archives is stored centrally in the EFG metadata repository, which was developed in the EFG project.&lt;ref&gt;Franca Debole, Pasquale Savino, Detlev Balzer: "[http://www.efgproject.eu/downloads/D22_Common_Interoperability_Schema_V3_2_4.pdf%20 Common interoperability schema for archival resources and filmographic descriptions]", 24 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The EFG metadata model is mostly based on the EN 15907: Film identification - Enhancing interoperability of metadata - Element sets and structures standard. Also other models, such as [[FRBR]] as well as WPE defined by the [[OLAC]] have been considered during establishing the EFG data model.&lt;ref&gt;http://efgproject.eu/guidelines_and_standards.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The multilingual and non-standardised metadata delivered by content providers is harmonised and cleaned before it is ingested in the EFG system. In contrast to the metadata, which is stored centrally, the digital objects remain on individual online platforms run by the archives. Deep links refer the user directly to the objects.

The EFG implemented the technology developed by the Digital Repository Infrastructure Vision for European Research (DRIVER) project. This open service system enables the creation and maintenance of infrastructures capable of supporting the construction of Information Spaces of digital objects collected from various archives. It also permits the creation of service-oriented applications where services can be shared and re-used in other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efgproject.eu/workplan.php EFG Project Workplan], 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===IPR management and administration===
The EFG project assessed copyright regulations and legal framework for online use of archival contents through research reports on open content models as well as working with organisations engaged with online publishing of copyrighted archival film material. EFG provided individual network partners with tools for consultations with representatives from rights owners’ and producers’ organisations in order to make the archival material available online.&lt;ref&gt;Ñusta Nina, Leontien Bout, Géraldine Vooren: "
[http://www.efgproject.eu/downloads/D_5_3_Final_Guidelines_Copyright_Clearance_online.pdf Final Guidelines on Copyright Clearance and IPR Management]", 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Follow-up project==

EFG1914 is the follow-up project of EFG. It began in February 2012 and runs for two years. Coinciding with the centenary of the [[First World War]], EFG1914 focuses on the digitization of films and other documents from and relating to the war, making the contents available through the European Film Gateway and Europeana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.project.efg1914.eu EFG1914 project website]&lt;/ref&gt; Like EFG, it is funded by the European Commission and coordinated by Deutsches Filminstitut. The project consortium consists of 26 partners, 21 of which are film archives.

To date, only about 20% of the silent film production of the time remains safe-guarded in the archives and was largely unavailable to the public. EFG1914 significantly simplifies access to these films, covering various fields, from newsreels to documentary, fiction, and propaganda films. EFG1914 also includes anti-war films produced after 1918, which reveal the tragedies of the 1910s.

==EFG and Europeana==
The European Film Gateway is linked to [[Europeana]], the digital showcase of Europe’s cultural and scientific heritage. [[Europeana]].eu offers search capabilities through millions of digital objects provided by Europe’s museums and galleries, archives, libraries and audio-visual organisations.

The '''Feminist Art Program''' (FAP) was a college-level art program for women developed in 1970 by artist [[Judy Chicago]] and continued by artists Rita Yokoi, [[Miriam Schapiro]], and others. The FAP began at Fresno State College, as a way to address gender inequities in art education, and the art world in general. In 1971, [[Judy Chicago]] and [[Miriam Schapiro]] brought the FAP to the newly formed [[California Institute of the Arts]], leaving Rita Yokoi to run the Fresno FAP until her retirement in 1992. The FAP at [[California Institute of the Arts]] was active until 1976. The students in the Feminist Art Program read women writers, studied women artists, and made art about being a woman based on group consciousness raising sessions. Often, the program was separate from the rest of the art school to allow the women to develop in a greenhouse-like environment and away from discerning critiques.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While the separatist ideology has been critiqued as reinforcing gender, the FAP has made a lasting impression on feminist art which can be seen in retrospectives, group exhibitions, and creative re-workings of the original projects.

== Fresno Feminist Art Program ==
The original Feminist Art Program was developed by artist [[Judy Chicago]]. The first such program was launched in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College, now [[California State University, Fresno]]. In the spring of 1971, It became a full 15-unit program. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, [[Vanalyne Green]], [[Suzanne Lacy]], Cay Lang, [[Karen LeCocq]], Jan Lester, Chris Rush, Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, [[Faith Wilding]], Shawnee Wollenman, [[Nancy Youdelman]], and Cheryl Zurilgen.&lt;ref name="Fresno1"/&gt; Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown [[Fresno, California|Fresno]]. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art.

The Fresno Feminist Art Program served as a model for other feminist art efforts, such as [[Womanhouse]], a collaborative feminist art exhibition and the first project produced after the Feminist Art Program moved to the California Institute of the Arts in the fall of 1971. [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville|Sheila de Bretteville]] and [[Arlene Raven]] also taught in that program. Womanhouse, like the Fresno project, also developed into a feminist studio space and promoted the concept of collaborative women's art.&lt;ref name="Fresno1" /&gt;

After Chicago left for [[California Institute of the Arts|CalArts]], the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by [[Joyce Aiken]] in 1973, until her retirement in 1992.{{#tag:ref|Aiken opened the all-women's [[co-op]] Gallery 25 with her students, developed the Fresno Art Museum's Council of 100 and the Distinguished Women Artist Series, which helped develop programming and exhibitions about women at the museum.&lt;ref name="Fresno1"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dr. Laura Meyer |author2=Nancy Youdelman | year= | title=A Studio of Their Own: The Legacy of the Fresno Feminist Art Experiment | work=A Studio of their Own | publisher= | url=http://www.astudiooftheirown.org/legacy.html | accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-alpha}}

==Feminist Art Program (FAP) at CalArts==
Later, Chicago and [[Miriam Schapiro]] reestablished the Feminist Art Program (FAP) at [[California Institute of the Arts]].

The Feminist Art Program (FAP) was created by Judy Chicago and [[Miriam Schapiro]] at the California Institute of the Arts in [[Valencia, California]], in 1971. Building on the "radical educational techniques" that she had first tried out in her classes for women in 1970{{ndash}}1971, when she worked at Fresno State, Chicago and Schapiro made the program, the first of its kind accessible to women only. Chicago in particular felt she had to "redo" her education as an art historian, since she had been taught by men exclusively and considered that this background forced a male perspective on her as an artist and disallowed her from developing her "own forms, artistic language, and subject matter".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harper|first=Paula|year=1985|title=The First Feminist Art Program: A View from the 1980s|journal=[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]|volume=10|issue=4|pages=762–81|jstor=3174313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist Studio Workshop==
The Feminist Studio Workshop was founded in Los Angeles in 1973 by Judy Chicago, [[Arlene Raven]], and [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]] as a two-year feminist art program. Women from the program were instrumental in finding and creating the [[Woman's Building]], the first independent center to showcase women's art and culture.

The '''[[flag]] of the [[Qing dynasty]]''' was an emblem adopted in the late 19th century featuring the [[Azure Dragon]] on a plain yellow field with the red flaming [[pearl]] of the [[three-legged crow]] in the upper left corner. It became the first national flag of China and is usually referred to as the "[[Yellow Dragon]] Flag" ({{zh|s=黄龙旗|t=黃龍旗|p=huáng lóng qí|first=t}}).

Ruling China from 1644 until the overthrow of the monarchy during the [[Xinhai Revolution]], the Qing dynasty was the last imperial dynasty in China's history. Between 1889 and 1912, the dynasty represented itself with the dragon flag.

== Design ==
Throughout the history of China's imperial dynasties, yellow was considered the royal color of successive Chinese emperors. The legendary first emperor of China was known as the [[Yellow Emperor]] ({{zh|s=黄帝|t=黃帝|p=huáng dì|first=t}}). Members of the imperial family of China at that time were the only ones allowed to display the color yellow in buildings and on garments. The Emperor of China  usually used a Chinese dragon as a symbol of the imperial power and strength. Generally, a five-clawed dragon was used by emperors only.

In [[Chinese culture]], a flaming pearl is shown on top of the dragon's head. The pearl is associated with wealth, good luck, and prosperity.

The design of the flag was largely based on the Plain Yellow Banner of the [[Eight Banners]].&lt;ref name="book2011" /&gt;

;The [[Eight Banners]]
The [[Eight Banners]] were administrative/military divisions under the Qing dynasty into which all Manchu households were placed. In war, the [[Eight Banners]] functioned as armies, but the banner system was also the basic organizational framework of all of Manchu society.

== Triangular version (1862–1889) ==
[[File:Imperial standard of the Qing Emperor.svg|200px|thumb|right|Variant of first Yellow Dragon Flag, with traditional border decorations.]]
The [[Second Opium War|Arrow Incident]] of 1856 occurred as a result of Chinese civilian vessels flying foreign flags as the Qing dynasty had no official flag at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author =肖吟新 (Xiao Yinxin) | coauthors =  | title = The story of the Qing dynasty national flag (清代国旗的故事) | url =  | date = 2002 | location =  | publisher = 世纪 | id =  | isbn =  | pages = 63}}{{nbsp}}{{Link language|zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862, sailors from the [[Beiyang Fleet|Chinese]] and [[Royal Navy|British]] navies clashed at [[Wuhan]] on the Yangtze River. In response to the British navy's claim of being unable to distinguish between Chinese governmental or navy ships and civilian vessels, [[Prince Gong (Qing dynasty)|Yixin (Prince Gong)]] urged [[Zeng Guofan]] to create a governmental flag for the Qing, and suggested use of a yellow dragon flag, which was also used as one of the [[Eight Banners]] of the Manchu as well as in the [[Military history of China (pre-1911)|Chinese army]]. After due consideration, Zeng Guofan concluded that a square flag bore too close a resemblance to the Plain Yellow Banner of the [[Eight Banners]] with the potential to be viewed as an endorsement of the [[Eight Banners]] hierarchy, he instead removed one corner to create a triangular flag.&lt;ref name="book2011"&gt;{{cite book | author = 施爱东 (Shi Aidong)  | coauthors =  | title = Qing dragon flag flourished through 50 years of sorrow (哀旗不幸 怒旗不争 大清龙旗50年) | url =  | date = 2011 | location =  | publisher = 民族艺术 | id =  | isbn =  | pages = 6}}{{nbsp}}{{Zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The triangular version of the yellow dragon flag was restricted to naval and governmental use only, no civilian ships were permitted  to fly the yellow pennant, and it never became the national flag.&lt;ref&gt;"係為雇船捕盜而用，並未奏明定為萬年國旗", "[the flag] is used for ferry and policing, but is not explicitly designated as the permanent national flag", from 《北洋水師章程》(Regulations of the Beiyang Fleet){{nbsp}}{{Zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on some diplomatic occasions and at international exhibitions, this flag was used to represent China.

In September 1881, when the two cruisers ''[[Chinese cruiser Chaoyong|Chaoyong]]'' and ''[[Chinese cruiser Yangwei|Yangwei]]'' ordered from [[Birkenhead]], [[England]] were sent to China, [[Li Hongzhang]] realized a triangular ensign was unique among naval flags of other countries. As a result, he petitioned the imperial court for permission and subsequently altered the triangular naval flag into a rectangular one.&lt;ref&gt;"今中國兵商各船日益加增，時與各國交接，自應重定旗式，以祟體制。應將兵船國旗改為長方式，照舊黃色，中畫青色飛龍。", "Nowadays the number of both Chinese military and commercial ships is growing. When our ships meet those of other nations they should display a flag based on a conformed system. [The government] should change the military flag to a pennant with an [[Azure Dragon|azure dragon]] in the middle",《北洋水師章程》(Regulations of the Beiyang Fleet) {{Zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeing Western countries flying national flags on official occasions, Li Hongzhang also asked [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] to select a national flag for the Qing dynasty. Among the proposals for use of the [[Ba gua]] flag, the Yellow dragon flag and the [[Qilin]] flag, Cixi selected the Yellow dragon design. In 1888, the imperial court promulgated the naval flag as the Qing national flag.&lt;ref&gt;《清朝国旗考》(Study on the Flag of Qing), 育民 {{Zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
The notion of yellow as representative of Manchu ethnicity was used in the flags of the [[Five Races Under One Union|Five-coloured flag]] of the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic of China]] and on the flag of the [[Empire of China (1915–1916)|Empire of China]], although in 1912 the former was challenged by [[Sun Yat-sen]], who thought it inappropriate to use the traditional imperial color to represent Manchu ethnicity.&lt;ref name=KMT&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.kmt.org.tw/hc.aspx?id=29 | title = Story of the National Flag, official website of the Kuomintang | accessdate=11 February 2014}}{{nbsp}}{{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, mustard yellow was used in the [[flag of Manchukuo]] in deference to the Qing dynasty, on whose flag it was based.

The blue dragon was featured in the [[Twelve Symbols national emblem]], which was the state emblem of China from 1913 to 1928.

==Naval flags of Qing dynasty==
;Horatio Nelson Lay's Proposal (1862)

When the Qing dynasty purchased battleships from the United Kingdom in 1862, [[Horatio Nelson Lay]] designed several naval flags based on the custom flag he designed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/22707/page/1 The London Gazette] ,13 February 1863&lt;/ref&gt; These proposals were not recognized by the Qing dynasty government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/cn~lo.html Lay-Osborne Flotilla (China)]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Beiyang Fleet (1874-1890)

The Beiyang Fleet was created in 1874, and several rank flags were introduced based on the traditional five color officials' flags of the old Chinese navy.

;Beiyang Navy (1890-1909)

The Beiyang Fleet became the national navy by ''Regulations of the Beiyang Fleet'' in 1888. However rank flags were not updated until 1890, when William Metcalfe Lang and [[Liu Buchan]] disputed about their rank flags in an [[Liu Buchan#Life|incident]]. Therefore, the [[British Royal Navy]] advisers proposed five new rank flags to replace the simple two rank flags system.&lt;ref&gt;Drawings of the flags in use at the present time by various nations, Royal Navy Admiral&lt;/ref&gt;

After the total defeat of the Beiyang Navy in [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1894, the new imperial navy was reorganized following the establishment of the department of navy in 1909.

He worked from the ships' plans rather than models to produce bow and stern images of ten ships, representing every class in the [[Royal Navy]] at that time. These ten ships were the [[HMS Ambuscade (1773)|''Ambuscade'']], [[HMS Portland (1770)|''Portland'']], [[HMS Sphinx (1775)|''Sphinx'']], [[HMS Kingfisher (1770)|''Kingfisher'']], [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|''Barfleur'']], [[HMS Royal George (1756)|''Royal George'']], [[HMS Enterprise (1774)|''Enterprise'']], [[HMS Experiment (1774)|''Experiment'']], [[HMS Royal Oak (1769)|''Royal Oak'']] and [[HMS Intrepid (1770)|''Intrepid'']]. He had previously produced two similar paintings of the [[HMS Alert (1753)|''Alert'']] in 1755.

[[File:Central dome interior of Kalenderhane Mosque.jpg|thumb|220px|Dome of the mosque]]

'''Kalenderhane Mosque''' ({{lang-tr|Kalenderhane Camii}}) is a former [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[church (building)|church]] in [[Istanbul]], converted into a [[mosque]] by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. With high probability the church was originally dedicated to the '''Theotokos Kyriotissa'''. The building is sometimes referred to as Kalender Haneh Jamissi and St. Mary Diaconissa. This building represents one among the few extant examples of a [[Byzantine Architecture|Byzantine]] church with domed [[Greek cross]] plan.

==Location==
The mosque is located in the [[Fatih]] district of [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], in the picturesque neighborhood of [[Vefa]], and lies immediately to the south of the easternmost extant section of the [[Valens Aqueduct|aqueduct of Valens]], and less than one km to the southeast of the [[Vefa Kilise Mosque]].

== History ==
The first building on this site was a [[Thermae|Roman bath]], followed by a sixth-century (the dating was based on precise coin finds in [[Stratification (archeology)|stratigraphic excavation]]) [[hall church]] with an [[apse]] laying up against the [[Valens Aqueduct|Aqueduct of Valens]]. Later – possibly in the seventh century – a much larger church was built to the south of the first church. A third church, which reused the [[sanctuary]] and the apse (later destroyed by the Ottomans) of the second one, can be dated to the end of the twelfth century, during the late [[Comneni]]an period.&lt;ref name=ma171&gt;Mathews (1976), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; It may date to between 1197 and 1204, since [[Constantine Stilbes]] alluded to its destruction in a fire in 1197.&lt;ref name=mag22730&gt;Magdalino (2007) pp. 227-230.&lt;/ref&gt; The church was surrounded by monastery buildings, which disappeared totally during the Ottoman period. After the [[Fourth Crusade|Latin conquest]] of [[Constantinople]], the building was used by the [[Crusades|Crusader]]s as a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church, and partly officiated by [[Franciscan]] clergy.&lt;ref name=mw156&gt;Müller-Wiener (1977), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Mary Diaconissa; Series 1903; View from right gallery; Century 36. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]
After the [[Fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]] in 1453, the church was assigned personally by [[Mehmed II]] to the ''[[Qalandariyya|Kalenderi]]'' sect of the [[Dervish]]. The Dervishes used it as a [[zaviye]] and ''[[imaret]]'' (public kitchen), and the building has been known since as ''Kalenderhane'' ({{lang-tr|"The house of the Kalenderi"}}).

The [[Waqf]] (foundation) was endowed with several properties in [[Thrace]], and many [[Turkish bath|hamam]]s in Istanbul and [[Galata]].&lt;ref name=mw156/&gt; Some years later, Arpa Emini Mustafa Efendi built a ''Mektep'' (school) and a [[Medrese]].&lt;ref name=mw156/&gt;

In 1746, Hacı Beşir Ağa (d. 1747), the ''[[Kizlar Agha|Kizlar Ağası]]'' of the [[Topkapı Palace]],&lt;ref&gt;He was the chief of the custodians of the Harem in the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]]'s Palace. During the last years of his life he endowed several religious foundations. Müller-Wiener (1977), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; built a [[mihrab]], [[minbar]] and [[Müezzin mahfili|mahfil]], completing the conversion of the building into a mosque.&lt;ref name=mw156/&gt; Ravaged by fire and damaged by earthquakes, the mosque was restored in 1855 and again between 1880 and 1890.&lt;ref name=mw156/&gt; It was abandoned in the 1930s, after the collapse of the [[minaret]] due to lightning, and the demolition of the Medrese.&lt;ref name=mw156/&gt;

The conservation of the building dates from the 1970s, when it was extensively restored and studied in a ten-year effort by Cecil L. Striker and [[Doğan Kuban]], who restored its twelfth century condition.&lt;ref&gt;Work at Kalenderhane Camii in Istanbul: First Preliminary Report Cecil L. Striker and Y. Doǧan Kuban Dumbarton Oaks Papers  Vol. 21, (1967) , pp. 267-271 Published by: Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1291266&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the minaret and the mihrab were rebuilt, which allowed the mosque to reopen for worship.&lt;ref&gt;A book by the two authors of the restoration was published in 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The restoration also provided a solution to the problem of the dedication of the church: while before it was thought that the church was named after ''[[Theotokos]] tēs Diakonissēs'' ("Virgin of the [[Deaconess]]es") or ''[[Christ]]os ho Akatalēptos'' ("Christ the Inconceivable"), the discovery of a donor [[fresco]] in the southeastern chapel and of another fresco over the main entrance to the [[narthex]] both bearing the word "Kyriotissa" ([[Greek language|Greek]] for ''Enthroned''), makes highly probable that the church was dedicated to the Theotokos Kyriotissa.&lt;ref name=ma172&gt;Mathews (1976), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture and decoration==
[[File:İstanbul 5606.jpg|220px|thumb|The sanctuary with the mihrab and minbar]]

The building has a central [[Greek Cross]] plan with deep [[barrel vault]]s over the arms, and is surmounted by a [[dome]] with 16 ribs. The structure has a typically middle Byzantine [[brickwork]] with alternating layers of [[brick]] and stone masonry. The entry is via an [[narthex|esonarthex]] and an exonarthex (added much later) in the west side.

An upper gallery over the esonarthex, following the same plan of the one existing in the [[Church of the Pantokrator (Constantinople)|Church of the Pantokrator]], was removed in 1854.&lt;ref name=ma171/&gt; Also the north and south aisles along the [[nave]] were destroyed, possibly during the nineteenth century too. The tall triple arches connecting the aisles with the nave are now the lower windows of the church.

The sanctuary is on the east side; however, the reconstructed mihrab and minbar are in a corner to obtain the proper alignment with [[Mecca]].

Two small chapels named ''[[prothesis (altar)|prothesis]]'' and ''[[diaconicon|diakonikon]]'', typical of the Byzantine churches of the middle and late period have survived.

The interior decoration of the church, consisting of beautiful colored marble panels and [[Molding (decorative)|moldings]], and of elaborated [[icon]] frames, is largely extant. The building possesses two features which both represent a unicum in Istanbul: a [[Mosaic#Byzantine mosaics|mosaic]], one meter square, representing  the "[[Presentation of Christ in the Temple|Presentation of Christ]]", which is the only [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|pre-iconoclastic]] exemplar of a religious subject surviving in the city, and a cycle of frescoes of the thirteenth century (found in a chapel at the southeast corner of the building, and painted during the Latin domination) portraying  the life of [[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis of Assisi]].&lt;ref name=ma172&gt;Mathews (1976), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the oldest known representation of the saint, and may have been painted only a few years after his death in 1226. Both have now been detached and partially restored, and can be seen in the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum|Archaeological Museum of Istanbul]].

As a whole, the mosque of Kalenderhane represents – together with the [[Gül Mosque]] in Istanbul, the [[Hagia Sophia (Thessaloniki)|Church of Hagia Sophia]] in [[Thessaloniki]] and the Church of the Dormition in (''[[Dormition of the Theotokos|Koimesis]]'') in [[Iznik]] (Nicaea),&lt;ref&gt;This church was destroyed by an act of vandalism in 1920, but was studied some years before. Krautheimer (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; one of the main architectural examples of a domed Greek cross church from the [[byzantine Architecture|Byzantine middle period]].&lt;ref&gt;Krautheimer (1986), p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Dynamic list}}
{{GeoGroupTemplate}}

This '''list of the tallest statues''' includes completed statues that are at least 30 meters tall, which was the assumed height of the [[Colossus of Rhodes]]. The height values in this list are measured to the highest part of the human (or animal) figure, but exclude the height of any [[pedestal]] (plinth), or other base platform. 

The definition of {{em|statue}} for this list is a free-standing sculpture (as opposed to a [[relief]]), representing one or more people or animals (real or mythical), in their entirety or partially (such as a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]]). Monuments that contain statues are included in this list only if the statue fulfills these and the height criteria.

== Existing statues ==
As of 2018, the main table includes 129 statues of height {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} or taller. The countries with entries in the list are:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2212">'''Morphology''', broadly, is the study of form or structure.  '''[[Folkloristics|Folkloristic]] morphology''', then, is the study of the structure of folklore and [[fairy tale]]s. 

Folkloristic morphology owes its existence to two seminal researchers and theorists: Russian scholar [[Vladimir Propp]] and Finnish folklorist [[Antti Aarne]].

Antti Aarne's theories, enlarged and expanded by American folklorist [[Stith Thompson]] in 1961 and by [[Hans-Jörg Uther]] in 2004, look at [[motif (folkloristics)|motifs]] rather than actions &amp;ndash; for example, "a soldier makes a deal with the devil" or "a soldier marries the youngest of three sisters". More than 2500 folk and fairy tales have been cataloged under this [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]]; the AaTh or [[Aarne–Thompson classification system|Aarne–Thompson]] number is as well-known to [[folklorists]] as [[Francis James Child]]'s identification of [[Child Ballads|ballads]] are to scholars of [[folk songs]].

[[Vladimir Propp]] was a Russian [[Structuralism (linguistics)|structuralist]] scholar.  He criticized Aarne's work for ignoring what [[motif (folkloristics)|motifs]] ''did'' in a tale, and analysed the [[Aarne–Thompson classification system|basic plot]], or action, components of Russian folk tales to identify their simplest irreducible narrative elements. His ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'' was published in Russian in 1928 and influenced [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Roland Barthes]], though it received little attention from Western scholars until it was translated into English in the 1950s.  

In the [[Alexander Afanasyev|Afanasyev]]'s collection of Russian fairy tales, Propp found a limited number of plot elements or "functions" that constructed all. These elements occurred in a standard, consistent sequence. He derived thirty-one generic functions, such as "a difficult task is proposed" or "donor tests the hero" or "a magical agent is directly transferred".

'''Nakshi kantha''', a type of embroidered quilt, is a centuries-old [[Bengal]]i art tradition of the [[Bengal]] Region, notable in [[Bangladesh]] and [[States and union territories of India|Indian states]] of [[West Bengal]] and [[Tripura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bengalcrafts.com/History.html |title=Nakshi Kantha-Benhal Craft |website=Bengal Crafts |access-date=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zaman |first=Niaz |year=2012 |chapter=Nakshi Kantha |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Nakshi_Kantha |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaismuddin.org" /&gt; The basic material used is thread and old cloth.{{sfn|Ghuznavi|1981|p=23}} Nakshi kanthas are made throughout Bangladesh, but the greater [[Mymensingh]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Faridpur District|Faridpur]] and [[Jessore]] areas are most famous for this craft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sirajuddin |first=Muhammad |date=1992 |title=Living Crafts in Bangladesh |location=Dhaka |publisher=Markup International |page=44 |oclc=29737195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colourful patterns and designs that are embroidered resulted in the name "Nakshi Kantha",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sareesofbengal.com/index.php/collections/kantha-stitch.html|title=Kantha Silk Sarees |first=Sarees|last=Kantha|website=sareesofbengal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was derived from the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] word "naksha", which refers to artistic patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aarong.com/nakshi-kantha/about-nakshi-kantha |title=About Nakshi Kantha |website=Aarong |access-date=9 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early kanthas had a white background accented with red, blue and black embroidery; later yellow, green, pink and other colours were also included. The [[running stitch]] called "[[kantha]] stitch" is the main stitch used for the purpose.{{sfn|Ghuznavi|1981|pp=23–24}} Traditionally, kantha was produced for the use of the family. Today, after the revival of the nakshi kantha, they are produced commercially.
== Etymology ==
The word ''kantha'' has no discernible etymological root.{{sfn|Ahmad|1997}} The exact time of origin of the word [[kantha]] is not accurately known but it probably had a precursor in ''kheta'' (khet [[Bengali language|Bengali]] means "field").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ahmad |first=Perveen |date=1999 |title=Lecture: Aesthetics and Vocabulary of Nakshi Kantha |url=http://ignca.nic.in/nl_01310.htm |journal=Vihangama |publisher=Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) |volume= VII |issue=1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Niaz Zaman, the word ''kantha'' originated from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''kontha'',  which means rags, as kantha is made of rags.{{sfn|Zaman|1993|p=36}}

==Tradition==
Like any other folk art, kantha making is influenced by factors such as materials available, daily needs, climate, geography, and economic factors.{{sfn|Zaman|1993}} Probably the earliest form of kantha was the [[patchwork]] kantha, and the kanthas of the decorative [[appliqué]] type evolved from this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dutt |first=Gurusaday |date=1995 |title=Kantha: Album of Art Treasure (Series One) |location=24 Parganas, India |publisher=Gurusaday Dutt Folk Art Society, Gurusaday Museum |oclc=475731213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
The earliest mention of Bengal Kantha is found in the book ''Sri Sri Chaitanya Charitamrita'' by Krishnadas Kaviraj, which was written some five hundred years ago. The famous Bengali poet [[Jasimuddin]] also had a very famous poem '[[Nakshi Kanthar Math]]' on Nakshi Kantha &lt;ref name="Jaismuddin.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sos-arsenic.net/lovingbengal/quilt.html |title=Quilt (Kantha) Art of Bengal |website=Jaismuddin.org |access-date=2 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Infobox geographical indication

==Making==
Traditionally old [[saree]]s, [[lungi]]s and [[dhoti]]s were used to make kanthas. Kantha making was not a full-time job. Women in almost every household were expert in the art. Rural women worked at leisure time or during the lazy  days of the rainy season, so taking months or even years to finish a kantha was normal.  At least five to seven sarees were needed to make a standard-size kantha. Today the old materials are replaced by new cotton cloths. Traditionally the thread was collected from the old sarees. That is rarely done today.

When a kantha is being made, first the sarees are joined together to attain the required size, and then layers are spread out on the ground. The cloths are then smoothed, and no folds or creases are left in between. During the process, the cloth is kept flat on the ground with weights on the edges. Then the four edges are stitched and two or three rows of large running stitches are done to keep the kantha together. At this stage, the kantha can be folded and stitched at leisure time.

Originally, designs and motifs were not drawn on the cloth. The design was first outlined with needle and thread, followed by focal points, and then the filling motifs were done. In a kantha with a predominant central motif the centre was done first, followed by corner designs and the other details. In some types of kanthas (carpet, lik and sujni, etc.) wooden blocks were used to print the outline. The blocks are replaced today by patterns drawn in tracing papers.

==Types==
The following is how kanthas are categorized, according to the stitch type:{{sfn|Zaman|1993}}

=== Running stitch ===

The [[running stitch]] kantha is truly the indigenous kantha. They are subdivided into Nakshi (figured) and par tola  (patterned). Nakshi (figured) kanthas are further  divided into motif  or scenic kanthas.

=== Lohori kantha ===

The name was derived from Persian word ''lehr'', which means wave. This type of kantha is particularly popular in [[Rajshahi]]. These kanthas are further divided into soja (straight or simple), Kautar khupi (pigeon coop or triangle), borfi or diamond (charchala, atchala or barachala).

=== Lik or anarasi ===

The Lik or Anarasi (pine apple) type of kantha is found in the [[Chapainawabganj District|Chapainawabganj]] and [[Jessore]] areas. The variations are lik tan, lik tile, lik jhumka, and lik lohori.

=== Cross-stitch or carpet ===

This type of kantha was introduced by the English during the British Rule in India.{{sfn|Zaman|1993|p=114}} The stitch employed in these kanthas is the [[cross-stitch]].

=== Sujni kantha ===

This type of kantha is found only in [[Rajshahi]] area. The popular motif used is the undulating floral and vine motif.

==Influence of religion and folk belief==
{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}

==Stitches==
{{main|Kantha}}
The earliest and most basic stitch found in kanthas is the ''[[running stitch]]''. The predominant form of this stitch is called the ''phor'' or kantha stitch.{{sfn|Zaman|1993|pp=44–45}} The other forms of stitches used are the  Chatai or ''pattern darning'', Kaitya or ''[[bending stitch]]'', ''weave running stitch'', ''[[darning stitch]]'', ''Jessore stitch'' (a variation of darning stitch), ''[[threaded running stitch]]'', Lik phor or anarasi or ghar hasia ''([[Holbein stitch|Holbein]]) stitches''. The stitches used in modern-day kantha are the ''Kasmiri stitch'' and the ''[[arrowhead stitch]]''. Stitches like the  ''[[herringbone stitch]]'', ''[[satin stitch]]'', ''[[backstitch]]'' and ''[[cross-stitch]]'' are occasionally used.{{sfn|Zaman|1993}}

==Types==
Kanthas generally denote quilts used as wrappers; however, all articles made by quilting old cloth may also be referred to by the same generic name. However, depending on the size and purpose, kanthas may be divided into various articles, each with its specific names. The various types of kantha are as follows:{{sfn|Ahmad|1997|p=v}}
* [[Quilt]] (lep in Bengali): A light quilted covering made from the old sarees/dhotis/lungis and sometimes from sheet cloths.
* Large spread (Naksi Kantha in Bengali): An embellished quilt embroidered in traditional motifs and innovative style
* [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] floor spread (Ason in Bengali): Cloth spread for sitting at a place of worship or for an honoured guest.
* Cosmetic wrapper (Arshilota in Bengali): A narrow embroidered wrapper to roll and store away a woman's comb, mirror, eye kohl, vermilion, sandal paste, oil bottle, etc. Often, a tying string is used to bind the wrap, as in later day satches.
* Wallet (Batwa thoiley in Bengali): Small envelope-shaped bag for keeping money, [[betel leaves]], etc.
* Cover for Quran (ghilaf in Arabic and Bengali): Envelope-shaped bag to cover the Quran.
* Prayer mats (Jainamaz in Bengali): Mats used by Muslims to say prayers.
* Floor spread (Galicha in Bengali): Floor coverings.
* Cloths wrapper (Bostani, guthri in Bengali): A square wrapper for books and other valuables.
* Cover (Dhakni in Bengali): Covering cloths of various shapes and sizes.
* Ceremonial meal spread (Daster khan in Bengali): A spread for eating place, used at meal time.
* Pillow cover (Balisher chapa or oshar in Bengali): A flat single piece pillow cover.
* Handkerchief (Rumal): Small and square in shape.
* Modern-day articles: Today newer uses are found for nakshi kanthas, such as bedspreads, wall hangins, cushion covers, ladies' purses, place mats, jewellery boxes, dress fronts, skirts border, shawls and sharees.

==Motifs==
Motifs of the nakshi kantha are deeply influenced by religious belief and culture. Even though no specific strict symmetry is followed, a finely embroidered naksi kantha will always have a focal point. Most kanthas will have a [[lotus (plant)|lotus]] as focal point, and around the lotus there are often undulating vines or floral motifs, or a shari border motif. The motifs may include images of flower and leaves, birds and fish, animals, kithen forms even toilet articles.

While most kantas have some initial pattern, no two naksi kantas are same. While traditional motifs are repeated, the individual touch is used in  the variety of stitches, colours and shapes. The notable motifs found in naksi kantha are as follows:

===Lotus motif===
[[File:Lotus motif.JPG|thumb|right|Lotus motif]]
The lotus motif is the most common motif found in kanthas. This motif is associated with Hindu iconography and thus is also very popular in the kantha. The  lotus is the divine seat. It is also symbolic of cosmic harmony and essential womanhood. The lotus is also the symbol of eternal order and  of the union of earth, water and, sky. It represents the life-giving power of water, and is also associated with the sun for the opening and closing of the petals. It is also the symbol of the recreating power of life. With the drying up of water, the lotus dies and with the rain it springs to life again. The lotus is associated with purity and the goddess [[Laksmi]], the goddess of good fortune and abundance. There are various forms of lotus motifs, from the eight-petaled ''astadal padma'' to the hundred petaled ''satadal''. In the older kanthas, the central motif is almost always a fully bloomed lotus seen from above.

===Solar motif===
The solar motif is closely associated with the lotus motif. Often, the lotus and the solar motifs are found together at the centre of a nakshi kantha. The solar motif symbolizes the life giving power of the sun. The sun is associated with the fire which plays a significant part in Hindu rites, both religious and matrimonial.

===Moon motif===
The moon motif has a religious influence, and is popular amongst the Muslims. Mostly it is in the form of a crescent moon accompanied by a star. This motif is particularly found in ''jainamaz'' kanthas.

===Wheel motif===
The wheel is a common symbol in Indian art, both Hindu and Buddhist. It is the symbol of order. The wheel also represents the world. The wheel is a popular motif in kanthas even when the maker has forgotten the significance of the symbol. The motif is relatively easy to make with ''chatai phor.''

===Swastika motif===
Su asti in [[Sanskrit]] means '''it is well'''. As a motif in Indian art, it dates back to the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. It is symbol of good fortune. It is also known as ''muchri'' or ''golok dhanda.''  With the passage of time, the design is more curvilinear than the four armed swastika of the [[Mohenjodaro]] seal. The symbolic design has significant influence in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.

===Tree of life motif===
[[File:BanglaNak1.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Contemporary Nakshi Kantha (used as a wall hanging) with animal, fish, butterfly, tree and human figure motif]]
The influence of this motif in Indian art and culture (as with kantha) may be traced back to the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. ''It is likely that the Indus people conceived the pipal as the [[Tree of Life]]...with the devata inside embodying the power of fecundity.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mukerjee |first=Radhakamal |date=1964 |title=The Flowering of Indian Art: The Growth and Spread of a Civilization |location=Bombay |publisher=Asia Pub. House |page=35 |oclc=30086718}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Buddhist times, the cult of the tree continued. [[Ficus religiosa|Pipal]] is sacred to the Buddha because he received enlightenment under its shade.  It reflects the fecundity of nature and is very popular in Bengal. Vines and creepers play an important role in kanthas and they contain the same symbolisation as that of tree of life. A popular motif in [[Rajshahi]] lohori is the betel leaf.

===Kalka motif===
[[File:Kalka motif.JPG|thumb|right|Close view of Kalka motif]]
This is a latter-day motif, dating from Mughal times.{{sfn|Zaman|1993|p=82}} The kalka or [[Paisley (design)|paisley]] motif originated in Persia and Kashmir and has become an integral image of the subcontinental decorative motif.{{sfn|Ahmad|1997|p=92}} It can be compared with a stylized leaf, mango or flame. The kalka is an attractive motif and number of varieties are experimented. Similar motifs can be found in traditional kashmiri [[shawl]]s.

Most nakshi kanthas have some kind of border. Either a sari border is stitched on or a border pattern is embroidered around the kantha. The common border found in kanthas are as follows:{{sfn|Zaman|1993|p=94}} [[File:Kantha border2.JPG|thumb|left|200px|From the top: necklace border, ladder border, gut taga, chik taga, nose ring border, fish border, panch taga, bisa taga, anaj taga]]

== Controversy regarding Geographical Indication ==
Despite being a Bangladeshi traditional art, the Indian state of West Bengal applied for the [[Geographical Indication]] for Nakshi kantha in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ttg-sric.iitkgp.ernet.in/GIDrive/images/gi/registered_GI_13June2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Due to absence of proper law on Geographical Indication in Bangladesh that time (which was later adopted), Bangladesh couldn't counter apply for the GI. The registry office had no option but to hand-over the Geographical Indication to West Bengal in 2008.

Bangladesh authority however later passed the "Bangladesh Geographical Indication (Registration and Protection) Act, 2013"&lt;ref&gt;http://dpdt.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/dpdt.portal.gov.bd/page/cc2ca133_4da5_42f7_9776_21cff528a032/GI%20Act-2013%20Bangla.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in parliament and with other necessary preparations now waiting for the next re-applying time cycle to claim the Geographical Indication for Nakshi kantha to Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpd.org.bd/index.php/press-reports-geographical-indication-jamdani-bangladesh-cpd-dialogue/ |title=Press reports on Protecting Geographical Indication Products in Bangladesh |website=Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) |access-date=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ficci-inbdpd.com/htm/recom.html |title=India – Bangladesh Parliamentary Dialogue |website=Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry |access-date=24 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20160127051454/http://www.ficci-inbdpd.com/htm/recom.html |archivedate=27 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3060">'''Organic décollage''' is a phrase used by the photographer Maria Stengard-Green&lt;ref name="pingmag"&gt;{{cite web | title =Maria Stengard-Green: The World As Organic Décollage | url=http://pingmag.jp/2008/12/03/maria-stengard-green-about-organic-decollage/ | accessdate = 2011-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the naturally occurring or non-artistically organized [[décollage]] that echoes the work of [[Mimmo Rotella]], [[Raymond Hains]], [[Jacques Villeglé]], [[Yves Klein]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and whose antecedents probably influenced their pioneering work.

{{quotation |Whilst organic decollage appears random, the mere effect of nature, it also reveals the ego, ideals and aspirations of the people who interfere with nature's interference; creating layers, nuance and sometimes meaning. |Maria Stengard-Green&lt;ref name="pingmag"/&gt;}}

This was particularly illustrated by the poster sites of the 2008 [[Rome]] City Council elections.

==Background==
In [[art]], [[décollage]] is created by cutting, ripping off or removing pieces of an original image or images to reveal the [[substrate (printing)|substrate]] or the images that lie beneath.  A distinct genre of  décollage is the torn [[poster]]. This happens when a poster has been pasted on top of another poster and then cut or torn to reveal the poster or posters beneath, or where ripped poster fragments are pasted, layer upon layer, to a canvas or substrate to create a new [[wikt:montage|montage]].

This genre is strongly associated with [[Mimmo Rotella]]; he invented it after returning from America in 1953 convinced that nothing in art was original.&lt;ref name="rogallery"&gt;{{cite web | title =Mimmo Rotella - Biography | url=http://www.rogallery.com/Rotella_Mimmo/rotella-biography.htm | accessdate = 2011-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had what he later described as a "[[Zen]] illumination" - the discovery of the advertising poster as a form of artistic expression.&lt;ref name="rogallery"/&gt; Armed with a [[penknife]], he began ripping off posters and pieces of the zinc mounts from [[Rome]]'s council advertising sites. He was then labelled the "poster ripper" or the "painter of glued paper". Rotella exhibited his "torn posters" for the first time at ''Esposizione d'arte attuale'' in 1955 and the term "décollage" was claimed for this genre in the same year by poet, artist and fellow Italian Emilio Villa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Celant | first =Germano | authorlink = | title =Mimmo Rotella: Selected Works | publisher =Skira | year =2007 | pages = | doi = | isbn =88-8491-359-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This French word, meaning "to unstick", first appeared in print in 1938 in ''Dictionnaire Abrégé du Surréalisme'' and notably from 1949 on, Hains was creating pieces from posters he had torn from Parisian walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =

(folio 1v) 36 x 26 cm

Paris, [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]]
]]
''For the third copy of the Utrecht Psalter. produced in England in the late 12th century, see [[Great Canterbury Psalter]].''
Paris, [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]]
 
The '''Paris Psalter''' (Paris, [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]], MS. gr. 139), designated by siglum '''1133''' (Rahlfs), is a [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] [[illuminated manuscript]] containing 449 folios and 14 full-page miniatures with a grand size of approximately 37 x 26.5 cm. "In a grand, almost classical style", as the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' puts it, together with [[Basil I]]'s [[Gregory Nazianzus|Homilies of St Gregory Nazianzus]], the Paris Psalter is considered a key monument of the so-called [[Macedonian Renaissance]] in [[Byzantine art]] during the 10th century. 

==History==

The Paris Psalter was large and extravagantly illustrated and was famous for its apparent [[classicism]] in figural style, painting, technique, and coloration. Among the classicizing features are personifications that have been incorporated in the compositions. The discovery that images such as [[David]] composing the psalms surrounded by personifications were clearly derived from Greco-Roman wall painting led 19th-century scholars to date the manuscript to the early 6th century. In the early 20th century, however, Hugo Buchthal and [[Kurt Weitzmann]], took issue with the [[Late Antique]] dating, conclusively demonstrating that the fully realized, confident classicism and illusionism of the miniatures were the product of the 10th century, thereby extending the persistence of classical art in Byzantium into the Middle Ages. The psalter was influential in its time and many centuries after that. It introduced a new way of illustrating psalters and manuscripts during the Byzantium period.

The David pictures emphasize the honor of the ideal emperor, often through the presence of personifications,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195046526.001.0001/acref-9780195046526-e-4234#&lt;/ref&gt; both classical and Christian. It has been proposed that the book was made for the future emperor [[Romanos II]] at the behest of his father, [[Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos]]. The assumption that it is a copy remains ambiguous, but there is no confusion that the MS stands at the head of a long line of smaller and later books that mimic its body of illustration. The abiding hypothesis that its miniatures are later insertions has recently been challenged. The book as we now have it was available ca.1300 when some of its miniatures were adapted for Psalters now at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] and [[Mount Sinai|Mt. Sinai]]. It was acquired by the French ambassador in [[Constantinople]] in 1557–59.

== Description ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2017}}
As a [[psalter]], the Paris Psalter is a copy of the [[Psalms|Book of Psalms]], also known as the Hebrew's Bible, in Ancient Greek. Psalters were often owned by the rich and royalty and were used a tool to learn how to read. Many psalters were copied from the Middle Ages and usually richly illuminated.

{{Empty section|date=December 2017|section=}}

== Illumination ==
The illuminations are large, each filling a full page. It was originally thought to be incomprehensible that a repertoire of pagan forms and subjects could have a place within a manuscript of Christian liturgical or private devotion.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/The_Glory_of_Byzantium_Art_and_Culture_of_the_Middle_Byzantine_Era_AD_843_1261#additional_resources|title=The Glory of Byzantium: Art and Culture of the Middle Byzantine Era, A.D. 843–1261 {{!}} MetPublications {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Personifications ===
The Psalter includes personifications which represent abstract concepts and virtues such as clemency. penance, and wisdom. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The figures are shown as a true sign of revived interest in antiquity. The personifications dominate the liturgical and devotional aspect of the manuscript. 

=== King David ===
[[King David]], the traditional author of many of the [[Psalms]], is depicted in eight illuminations. He is presented in two primary ways: religiously (seen as Christ) and royal (model for a king). For example, David's victory over [[Goliath]] could be seen as a comparison to Christ's victory over Satan or the emperor's victory over an enemy.

The '''''Pietà''''' now in the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]] in [[Venice]] is one of the last paintings by the Italian master [[Titian]], and in its final, extended, state was left incomplete at his death in 1576, to be completed by [[Palma Giovane]].  Titian had intended it to hang over his grave, and the two stages of painting were to make it fit in two different churches.

The picture is among Titian's last, one of several left unfinished at his death.  An inscription in the lower part of the picture records that it was finished by Palma Giovane, whose interventions seem to have been kept to the minimum necessary, and doing his best to match Titian's own style.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, 153; Rosand, 59&lt;/ref&gt;  A minimalist view of the areas he worked on is that it "was limited to the angel with the torch and to touching up the tympanum of the stone shrine",&lt;ref&gt;Accademia, 180&lt;/ref&gt; but the female statue and Jerome's cloak have also been suspected of showing his hand, and he may have touched up the architecture more generally.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, 153; Rosand, 58–59&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is one of a group in Titian's distinctive late style, which begins fully about 1570, though continuing trends seen in earlier works as far back as the mid-1550s.  He often kept paintings in the studio for a long period, with several probably unfinished at his death in 1576. His brushwork becomes bold, but imprecise and impressionistic, and worked over many times, as recorded in a famous description by Palma Giovane.&lt;ref&gt;Steer, 138–144&lt;/ref&gt;  The distinction between forms and the space between them almost disappears, and "The forms emerge like wraiths out of the circumambient darkness, and mass is reduced to a flickering pattern of colour and light.  In his last years only these elements had reality for Titian."&lt;ref&gt;Steer, 144 quoted; Jaffé, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a long-running argument about which of the works of the 1570s have been completed, and by whom. In this case, the main group of the ''Pietà'', in its first form, is known to have been delivered by Titian as finished, and the full expanded composition to have been finished by Palma Giovane.  Other important paintings of the 1570s are ''[[Tarquin and Lucretia (Titian)|Tarquin and Lucretia]]'', which was delivered in 1571, the ''[[Saint Jerome in Penitence (Titian, 1575)|Saint Jerome]]'' delivered in 1575, and the ''[[Flaying of Marsyas (Titian)|Flaying of Marsyas]]'', ''[[The Death of Actaeon]]'', the [[Hermitage Museum]]'s ''[[Saint Sebastian (Titian, Hermitage)|Saint Sebastian]]'' and the ''[[The Crowning with Thorns (Titian, Munich)|Crowning with Thorns]]'' in Munich, all of which were probably in his studio at his death.&lt;ref&gt;Steer, 144; Jaffé, 27–28, 151–153, 164, 166, 172, 178&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Tiziano, pietà, 1576, 02.JPG|thumb|The bottom right-hand corner]]
An original, much smaller, composition just showing the basic two figures of the standard [[Pietà]] subject in Christian art, which consists of [[Virgin Mary]] cradling the dead body of Christ, was expanded after being completed and delivered (see below).&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, 153; Hale, 704–705, 720–721&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind the central figures there is now a large [[rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] [[Mannerist]] [[aedicule]] or niche, flanked by statues standing on plinths carved with giant lion heads.  Along the top of the [[broken pediment]] six flaming lamps give a dull light, with another half-hidden in the centre, with vegetation around them, perhaps "the figleaves of the Fall of Man".&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 721&lt;/ref&gt;  A patch of dark sky can be seen at top left.  Three massive [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]]-like blocks in the centre drop below even the bottom of the pediment, a feature typical of the Mannerist architecture of [[Giulio Romano]] and his followers.  These three blocks have been said to represent the [[Holy Trinity]],&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 721&lt;/ref&gt; or "Christ as foundation of the faith".&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, 8. In reality, they would seem to be more hindrance than help to the structural strength of the niche. Titian's playing fast and loose with the classical architectural vocabulary is shown by the set of ''[[guttae]]'' beneath the central stone, a breach of architectural etiquette otherwise not encountered until the 19th century.&lt;/ref&gt;

A figure who is either the [[Nicodemus]] of the gospels or, as usually thought today, [[Saint Jerome]], approaches Christ on his knees, and reaches out to touch his hand.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, 7; [[Joseph of Arimathea]] has been proposed, but he is  described as wealthy in the gospels, which does not fit his dress here. Rosand, 60&lt;/ref&gt; This is generally agreed to be a self-portrait of Titian.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, 158; Hale, 722; Nichols, 8; Rosand, 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; On the left, standing and completing a [[right-angled triangle]] of the human figures,&lt;ref&gt;Rosand, 61&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Mary Magdalene]], who unlike the other figures seems to be in motion. Whether she has just arrived on the scene, or is rushing away in horror is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, 7 thinks the latter&lt;/ref&gt;

The two statues at the sides of the grand niche in the background are [[Moses]] on the left and the [[Hellespontine Sibyl]] on the right, both identified by inscriptions on their pedestals.  The Sibyl was thought to have prophesied the coming of Christ and his crucifixion.&lt;ref&gt;Rosand, 60; Hale, 721–722; Accademia, 180. Jaffé, 153 identifies the figure as [[Saint Helena]], which would be plausible if there were not an inscription.&lt;/ref&gt;  An [[putto]]-angel with a flaming torch illuminates the scene, which is dark and evidently set at night. In particular his torch reveals the gold [[mosaic]] in the [[semi-dome]] of the niche, where in the centre a [[pelican]] feeds its young by pecking its own breast to draw blood, a phenomenon believed since classical times in traditional zoology, which had become a common visual symbol of the [[Passion of Christ]] and its [[Redemption (theology)|redemptive]] effects for man.&lt;ref&gt;Rosand, 60; Hale, 721 (not very accurately)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the bottom right corner a small ''[[ex voto]]'' picture is propped up against the base of the right-hand statue.  It shows two men kneeling in prayer to a ''Pietà'' in the air.  These are agreed to represent Titian and his son Orazio, probably praying to be spared from the plague that in fact killed them both,&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 722; Rosand, 60&lt;/ref&gt; a full year after it arrived in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 708–723; Nichols, 8&lt;/ref&gt; Behind the picture, and partly concealed by it, is a small shield with Titian's coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 722&lt;/ref&gt;  In the bottom left corner another young angel is picking up an urn, perhaps the Magdalene's attribute of a jar of ointment.

==History==
Titian had always intended to be buried in the church in [[Pieve di Cadore]] where he was baptized.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 704&lt;/ref&gt;  He frequently visited the village, on the edge of Venetian territory in the mountains some 110 km almost due north of the city, although he had left it for Venice over 75 years before his death in 1576.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 3, 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;  But around 1572 a series of rows with the local authorities there and his relations led him to change his mind, and plan a burial in the large [[Franciscan]] church of the [[Frari]] in Venice, which contained two of his important early masterpieces, the ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|Assunta]]'' on the main altar and the ''[[Pesaro Madonna|Pesaro Altarpiece]]'' on a side wall,&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 691–693, 705&lt;/ref&gt; nearly opposite the intended site.&lt;ref&gt;Rosand, 61&lt;/ref&gt;

He chose a spot in a chapel with a famous [[crucifix]] in it and made the ''Pietà'' for it, presenting it to the church. He thought he had an agreement with the friars, but it emerged that they would not move the crucifix, and hung the painting in another chapel.  Titian was furious, and eventually got the [[papal nuncio]] in Venice to instruct the friars to return the painting to him, in a decree of 1 March 1575.  Titian now planned once again to be buried in the church in Pieve di Cadore, with the painting over the high altar, and once the painting was back in his studio he extended it to fit the space there.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 705; Rosand, 57&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1576 Titian died in the middle of a major epidemic of [[Second plague pandemic|plague]], followed a few days later by his son Orazio, and it was impossible to arrange for the transportation of the body to Cadore. He was at least not buried in one of the mass-graves used for most of the dead, but quietly carried to the Frari and buried there.  The painting would probably have been taken to Cadore if Orazio had survived the plague, but with his death the ownership of Titian's estate was disputed between various heirs, and it remained in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 722–723&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was finished by Palma Giovane; it seems he only received it some years after Titian's death, and then had it in his studio for some years.  He added an inscription recording his contribution below Christ.  Only after Palma's death in 1628 did it finally hang in a church, but this was St Angelo in Venice, which was closed in 1810, and demolished in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, 11; ''Late Titian and the sensuality of painting'', 310 for church dates.&lt;/ref&gt;  It entered the Gallerie dell'Accademia in 1814.&lt;ref&gt;Accademia, 180&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting has achieved a presence in the Frari as it is one of the five religious paintings by Titian represented in marble [[relief]]s on the large monument to him put up in the church in the 19th century, in the chapel where the painting was intended to hang.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Frari (Venice) nave right - Monument of Titian.jpg|photo]]; the Pietà copy at top left.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Matching the location==
In the Frari the painting was intended to hang in the Cappella di Crocefisso ("Chapel of the Crucifix"), where Titian was buried, and where his monument now stands. Like his much earlier masterpiece, the ''[[Pesaro Madonna|Pesaro Altarpiece]]'', which was diagonally across the church, the painting was designed to be viewed in passing by people moving through the huge church, as well as those stopping in front of it.  Those entering at the back and moving forward would pass the painting on the second altar on their right, seeing the triangle of figures rising to a termination in Mary Magdalene.  Indeed, she looks and gestures roughly in the direction of the ''Pesaro Altarpiece'', further up the church on the other side, while the statues, both looking to the left at a sharper angle, have been seen as indicating the way to the ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|Assunta]]'' on the high altar.&lt;ref&gt;Rosand, 60–61; Nichols, 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion of the painting to fit the space in Cadore (see below) affected each edge of the painting. To the original two strips of canvas, sewn together, five more were added: one across the whole top, two at the sides, a thinner strip at the bottom, and a small piece at the botton right corner.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 721&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
For Tom Nichols, "Titian's dramatization of the conflicting emotions of those who witness Christ's death lends his painting its bleakly expressive power.  His focus effectively breaks up the usual formal unity expected of a pietà, isolating its protagonists from each other to undermine more abstract possibilities of aesthetic harmony or more resolved theological meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Pietà'' was an unusual subject in Venice, and Titian's choice of it probably relates to [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[The Deposition (Michelangelo)|Florentine Pietà]]'', also originally intended to decorate the artist's tomb, with a self-portrait as Nicodemus.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, 9; Rosand, 60&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout Titian's career he had reflected the ''paragone'', or argument over superiority in art, with works asserting the superiority of painting over sculpture, within painting of Venice over [[Florence]], and "it is not difficult to read the radically pictorial quality of his Virgin and Child as a last attempt to defeat his great rival."&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, 9 quoted; Rosand, 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erwin Panofsky]] prefers to see it as "A lifelong rivalry, compounded of mutual respect as well as opposition, ended in a tribute paid by the survivor to his defunct antagonist — and doing honor to both".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Rosand, 60&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also elements looking back to Titian's master [[Giovanni Bellini]], for example the mosaic semi-dome, seen in Bellini's ''[[San Giobbe Altarpiece]]'' of c. 1487, now also in the Accademia.&lt;ref&gt;Rosand, 59; Nichols, 7–8; Accademia, 89 for the painting&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Sydney Joseph Freedberg|Sidney J. Freedburg]], it "is less a painting about Christian death and tragedy than a splendid and impassioned affirmation of both art and life. Its true protagonist is the Magdalene, salient in a radiance of green against a gold-shot background, who walks out of the picture into the real world, shouting, palpable, magnificent, and one with us in life. She illustrates a cry of grief, but makes the effect of pronouncement of victory.&lt;ref&gt;Freedburg, 518&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pir Mardakan Khanqah''' ({{lang-az|'''Pir Mərdəkan xanəgahı'''}}) is historic architectural monument located in the village of Goylar, 16 km south-west of Shamakhi district of the [[Azerbaijan Republic]]. The complex includes a tomb, a dynasty building and small auxiliary buildings. It was built in XIII-XIV centuries. According to some sources, this is the tomb of Seyid Mardakani, one of the famous scholars of his time.

==History==
Some of the remaining inscriptions on the grave stone and in the wall were read by M. Nematova.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title= PİR MƏRDƏKAN TÜRBƏSİ|url= http://shamakhi-encyclopedia.az/pir-mərdәkan-turbәsi/|publisher= shamakhi-encyclopedia.az|language= az|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On these inscriptions it is shown that the monument was built in 1188 – 1203 (583 – 600 of [[Islamic calendar|Hijri calendar]]. According to the style characteristics, history of the monument is dated back to the early XIII century.&lt;ref&gt;А. В. Салаьзаде – К датировке некоторых памятников Азербайджана, ИАНА, 1952, № 5 p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an ancient cemetery, [[caravanserai]] complex around the khanqah. An inscription on the [[facade]] of the monument, written in the [[Arabic]] written in [[thuluth]] script with [[kufic]] element, says: ''"In the Name of Allah, the merciful and the gracious. This is the grave of the [[Sheikh]], the [[Imam]], the greatest scientist, the believer, Tair Taj Al-Huda Mardakani Ibn Ali. May Allah have mercy upon them..."'' &lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;

It is possible to clarify history of the monument based on the second inscription on the tomb. A small part, two lines of the inscription fixed on the left wall, on the left side of entering from the door, remains: ''"The greatest [[padishah]], [[khagan]]... Farrukhzad ibn Fazilalmuwahhid Manuchihr..."'' &lt;ref&gt;M.Nemətova. "Azərbaycan pirləri". Baku: 1992, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The author explains that this is ruler is Shirvanshah [[Farrukhzad I]], the son of Shirvanshah [[Manuchihr III of Shirvan|Manuchihr III]]. He also lived in the XIII century.&lt;ref&gt;M.Nemətova. "Azərbaycan pirləri". Baku: 1992, p. 21 - 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientist notes that there is a place named Madak in [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Iranian Azerbaijan]]. The "-ani" suffix indicates that the owner of the grave is from there. The word "Madakani" transformed into "Mardakan", over the history.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;

==Architectural features==
The tomb, which is a part of the complex has reached today’s era with almost its original view. These mausoleums, which have other examples in the [[Architecture of Azerbaijan|architecture of Azerbaijan]], typically consist of a combination of two-domed and tower-shaped tombs. As examples of this type of mausoleum in architecture of Azerbaijan, the tomb in Alinjachay Khanqah in Nakhchivan and other tombs can be. The plan of the Pir Mardakan mausoleum repeats the very coincidental version of the tombs  with [[dome]]s. By volume, these types of tombs consist of combination of two combinations. The bottom part is with dome and tower, and the upper part is covered with dome. The upper part looks independent from outside in terms of its composition, not as a continuation of the bottom part since usually in such tombs there is no gradual transition between cube-shaped and the upper tower parts.&lt;ref&gt;K. M. Məmmədzadə - Azərbaycanda inşaat sənəti, Baku, Elm, 1978, p. 50 - 51&lt;/ref&gt;

As mausoleums with dome were temple-type buildings, people used to come and pay visit to buried and hold religious ceremonies in such places. Therefore, these type of mausoleums were also used as a mosque. Internal tomb part of the mausoleum square shaped according to structure of it and through [[squinch]]es in the corners it turns into an octagon. Eight-edged prism on the octagon is covered with pyramidal tent. When remotely looking at the tomb, it resembles an ordinary octagonal tomb because relief of the earth covers the lower-cubed portion. The size of outer walls of it is 4.6x5 m, and the internal walls are 2.6x2.6 m. The height of the square part is 3 m, the height of the pyramid is 4.7 m.

From the east side of the tomb khanqah building with three rooms is fixed. Large room is 4.4x7.3 m in size and is for worship. Only one of the rooms reached today’s era. The other two rooms are completely destroyed.

This monument belongs to a group of tombs of Azerbaijan with towers and domes according to many features of it. Monuments that share similatiries with Pir Mardakan Khanqah according to the structural and architectural features, monuments similar to Pir Mardakan Khanate are spread in other Turkic countries. For example, in [[Turkmenistan]] there are several architectural monuments repeating the architectural features of this tomb. Fakhraddin Razi and Sheikh Sharif mausoleums in Kunya-Urgench can be examples.&lt;ref&gt;Н. М. Бачинский – Архитектурные памятники Туркмении, вып 1, Ашкабад, 1939, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KarlII monks.jpg|thumb|[[Charles the Bald]] receives the [[First Bible of Charles the Bald|Vivian Bible]] from the monks of [[Tours]] in 845 (fol. 423)]]

A '''presentation miniature''' or '''dedication miniature''' is a [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] painting often found in [[illuminated manuscript]]s, in which the [[Donor portrait|patron or donor]] is presented with a book, normally to be interpreted as the book containing the miniature itself.&lt;ref name="b102"&gt;Brown, 102&lt;/ref&gt;  The miniature is thus symbolic, and presumably represents an event in the future.  Usually it is found at the start of the volume, as a [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] before the main text, but may also be placed at the end, as in the [[Vivian Bible]],&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 116&lt;/ref&gt; or at the start of a particular text in a collection.&lt;ref&gt;Kren &amp; McKendrick, 197&lt;/ref&gt;

In earlier manuscripts the recipient of the book may be a dead saint, the founder of a monastery or monastic order, for example, and the person handing over the book the abbot, or sometimes the scribe of the book.  The genre is an extension of other forms of dedication portraits, for example wall-paintings or mosaics in churches showing the person who commissioned the church holding a model of it. Ultimately they stretch back to scenes where classical rulers receive tribute, or those where a procession of Early Christian martyrs carry their crowns to present Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, 83&lt;/ref&gt; The miniatures are often found in luxury books presented to the emperor or another major figure, which usually followed significant donations of land to the monastery concerned.

In the early period the manuscripts concerned are normally religious books, especially liturgical ones. The texts are old, and the "offering" represented is the creation of an expensive illuminated manuscript. In the late [[Middle Ages]] works,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 102, places this revival in the 15th century, but 14th century examples are numerous, as [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ah7FgcSdn9IC&amp;pg=PA251 Cynthia Stone points out]. Two are illustrated here.&lt;/ref&gt; often secular ones, are generally presented by their author or translator, though lavish copies of older texts may also still receive presentation miniatures.  In these first cases the "offering" is usually the text itself, and the patron had presumably often paid for his own luxury copy himself, though some translators and even authors were also scribes.  Now the text dedication to the patron, at this period often long and flowery, came to form part of the work itself, and at least the text was repeated in further copies.  Such author's dedications, now far shorter, have remained part of the printed book. Sometimes presentation miniatures were also repeated in subsequent copies.&lt;ref name="b102"&gt;Brown, 102&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michelle P. Brown|Michelle Brown]] distinguishes between presentation miniatures, where the actual book containing the miniature passed between the parties shown, and dedication miniatures in subsequent copies made for other people.&lt;ref name="b102"&gt;Brown, 102&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early medieval==
[[File:Beauvais+Vignay.jpg|thumb|Two royal visits to respectively the author and translator of [[Vincent de Beauvais]]'s work translated in French by [[Jean de Vignay]] as ''Le Miroir historial'', c. 1333]]
Royal presentation miniatures are especially a feature of Late [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]], providing a series of portraits of the [[Ottonian emperor]]s, mostly not actually shown with the book, and a precedent for later rulers.  In a continuation and intensification of late Carolingian trends, many miniatures contain miniatures depicting the donors of the manuscripts to a church, including bishops, abbots and abbesses, and also the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 116–118&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases successive miniatures show a kind of relay: in the [[Hornbach Sacramentary]] the scribe presents the book to his abbot, who presents it to St [[Pirmin]], founder of [[Hornbach, Germany|Hornbach]] Abbey, who presents it to St Peter, who presents it to Christ, altogether taking up eight pages (with the facing illuminated tablets) to stress the unity and importance of the "command structure" binding church and state, on earth and in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;[[Solothurn]] Zentralbibliothek Codex U1 (ex-Cathedral Treasury), folios 7v to 10r; Alexander, 89–90; Legner, Vol 2, B2, all eight pages illustrated on pp. 140–141; Dodwell, 134&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Egbert Psalter]] also has four pages of presentation scenes, with two each spread across a full opening, the left with a bowing offeror in near profile, the right with the enthroned receiver. [[Egbert (archbishop of Trier)|Egbert, Archbishop of Trier]] receives the book in the first pair, then presents it to [[Saint Peter]] in the second.&lt;ref&gt;Head, Thomas. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/767279 "Art and Artifice in Ottonian Trier."] ''Gesta'', Vol. 36, No. 1. (1997), pp 65–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large proportion of the portraits that survive of monastic scribes, who may also have been the artists for the miniatures, come from presentation miniatures, more typically showing presentations to either saints or other clergy who had commissioned books.  Such scenes continue to appear in the Romanesque period.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, 89–93&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest surviving portrait of a reigning English king (coins excepted) and the earliest English presentation miniature shows [[Æthelstan]] presenting Saint [[Cuthbert]] with the copy of Bede's ''Life of Saint Cuthbert'' containing it, probably in 934.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, 170; {{cite web|title=History by the Month: September and the Coronation of Æthelstan’|date=8 September 2015|publisher=Parker Library, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge|url= https://theparkerlibrary.wordpress.com/2015/09/08/history-by-the-month-september-and-the-coronation-of-aethelstan/|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was presented by Æthelstan to the saint's shrine in [[Chester-le-Street]]; southern-based medieval English kings were always careful to pay due respect to Cuthbert, the great saint of the North.&lt;ref name="Foot 2011 155 156"&gt;Foot, ''Æthelstan: The First King of England'', pp.&amp;nbsp;155–156&lt;/ref&gt;

In the High Middle Ages presentation miniatures in luxury copies of the main liturgical and devotional books, showing the book being presented, tended to be replaced by miniatures of the owner or donor at prayer, sometimes using a book which can be taken as the volume containing the miniature. These often include the object of the prayer, Christ, the Virgin Mary, or a saint.&lt;ref&gt;Kren &amp; McKendrick, 180–181, 194–196, 227–229, 321–323, 371–373&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the owner is shown being "presented" to Christ or the Virgin by his [[patron saint]], as though at court, but these are not generally called "presentation miniatures".

The form did not die out, however. The earliest surviving copy of the ''[[Grandes Chroniques de France]]'' was presented by the monks of [[Basilica of St Denis|Saint-Denis]], who had compiled the text, to [[Philip III of France|Philip III]] in about 1274, with two presentation scenes, though neither act as frontispieces.&lt;ref&gt;Hedeman, 11–17; figs. 3 and 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late medieval==
[[File:MMW 10B23 002R MINMJean de Vaudetar.jpg|thumb|upright|Jean de Vaudetar, [[valet de chambre]] to King [[Charles V of France]], presents the king with his gift of a ''[[Bible Historiale]]'' in 1372.  Miniature by [[Jean Bondol]], who was also a valet de chambre.  Vaudetar was a nobleman, already in charge of the [[Louvre]] palace, who was to progress further at court.]]

As book culture increased in the Late Middle Ages, authors still relied on gifts from patrons to reward their efforts, and it is in this context that the dedication miniature revived. Very often the miniature was in the personal copy made by the patron for his library. The author or translator kneels, holding out his book, and the patron is often surrounded by a group of courtiers, advertising his generosity in encouraging literature.  The public and ceremonial presentation of gifts from, but mostly to, the monarch or lord was a great feature of medieval court life, concentrated on the New Year.&lt;ref&gt;Stratford, 126–133&lt;/ref&gt;  A high proportion of the surviving portraits of late medieval scholars and artists, and a significant proportion of those of the patrons, come from these miniatures, many of which show individualized features and were probably by artists who had had good opportunity to observe their subjects.

The French royal family, including their Burgundian cousins, led the fashion, which spread to England and elsewhere.  Extensively illuminated books were also presented to royalty as diplomatic gifts, or by ambitious courtiers to the monarch, and these might include presentation miniatures.  Sometimes the presentation miniature might be the only one in a book; such was the case with [[Louis de Gruuthuse]]'s copy of [[Boccaccio]]s ''De mulieribus claris'' translated into French ([[BnF]], Ms Fr. 133, f 2r).&lt;ref&gt;Lie, 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;

King [[Charles V of France]] (r. 1338–1380), one of the first great [[bibliophile]] medieval monarchs, had a large library and especially encouraged and commissioned translations of books into French, which were very often given a presentation miniature.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, 143&lt;/ref&gt; He continues to be shown in dedication miniatures a century after his death.  Louis de Gruuthuse's copy of about 1470 of the "[[Pseudo-Seneca]]"'s ''De remediis fortuitorum'' translated into French for Charles V has a miniature showing the king receiving the text, but with de Gruuthuse standing to the side (BnF, Ms. fr. 1090, fol. 1).&lt;ref&gt;Kren &amp; McKendrick, 246–247&lt;/ref&gt;  The copy made about 1475 for [[Margaret of York, Duchess of Burgundy]] had a different image.  This is a double presentation where firstly [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] himself hands the text to the translator, who bends a knee to receive it, and then down a passageway in the background the translator kneels to present it to two male figures.&lt;ref&gt;Kren &amp; McKendrick, 197–198&lt;/ref&gt;

As here, dedication miniatures for old texts sometimes go well back in history, sometimes giving historic figures the features of contemporary ones. [[Guillebert de Lannoy]] (1386–1462), a leading Burgundian nobleman, diplomat and traveller, wrote around 1440 ''L'Instruction de josne prince'' ("Advice for a Young Prince"), which he dressed up with a fictional origin in the court of [[Norway]] "long, long ago", followed by a rediscovery of the manuscript text.  The dedication miniature in [[Charles the Bold]]'s copy illustrates the Norwegian story, but using up-to-date Burgundian costume and, it seems, the faces of the ducal family.&lt;ref&gt;Kren &amp; McKendrick, 235–237&lt;/ref&gt;  Another variation was to show the patron visiting the author, or even the illuminator, as they worked, an indication in the rise in status of those producing manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, 32&lt;/ref&gt;

The form survived the arrival of printed books, though they became much rarer. When [[Edward IV of England]]'s brother in law, [[Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers]] had [[William Caxton]] print his own translation of the ''[[Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers]]'' in 1477, the book he presented to Edward was a special manuscript copied from the printed edition, with a presentation miniature, implying "that a printed book might not yet have been regarded as sufficiently distinguished for a formal gift of this kind".&lt;ref&gt;Backhouse, 269&lt;/ref&gt;  Some printed books continued the form in [[woodcut]], with printers such as [[Antoine Vérard]] in Paris joining the types of presenters depicted.

'''''Sequences Real Time Art Festival''''' is an independent biennial, established in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]] in 2006. 

The aim of the festival is to produce and present progressive visual art with special focus on time-based mediums, such as [[performance]], [[sound art]], video and public interventions. An offspring of the dynamic art scene that thrives in Reykjavik, Sequences is the first art festival in Iceland to focus on visual art alone. New artistic directors are hired to reshape each edition of Sequences according to their vision, making it unique and different every time.

== Concept ==
The aim of the festival is to celebrate and exhibit cutting-edge visual art with a special emphasis on art in public/urban spaces. Sequences features time-based art - such as [[performance]], video and [[sound art]] - and creates a cross-platform for these art forms as well as music and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/iceland/10276591/Reykjavik-Iceland-a-cultural-city-guide.html|title=Reykjavik, Iceland: a cultural city guide|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than three hundred artists from around the world have participated in the festival, along with the artist-run galleries, the bigger museums and institutions in [[Iceland]]. 

For Sequences Art Festival in 2008 (held October 11 to 17) the curatorial board decided to acknowledge renowned artists for their notable contribution to real-time art mediums. The honorary artist of Sequences 2008 was the Icelandic artist ''Rúrí''.

The fourth Sequences Art Festival was held in 2009 (October 31 to November 7, 2009). The festival's honorary artist was the 80-year-old concept art legend Magnús Pálsson. Born in East-Iceland in 1929, Pálsson studied theatre design and art in the early 1950s and became an active participant in Iceland's embryonic avant-garde, collaborating with alternative theatre groups as well as with other artists such as Dieter Roth and later the SÚM-group of young artists that formed in 1965.

== History ==
Sequences was founded by four artist-run venues: [[The Living Art Museum]], ''Kling &amp; Bang Gallery'', ''The Dwarf Gallery'' and ''Gallery Bananananas'' (closed since 2007)—as well as the [[Center for Icelandic Art]] (CIA.IS). Each institute has a representative on the board, but all the major venues and cultural institutions in the greater-Reykjavík area have worked with the festival in one way or another. The first festivals in 2006-2008, were annual but in 2009 it was decided to slow the pace and hold the festival every other year.

For the first time, the Sequences Festival took place in different locations in the city center of [[Reykjavík]], accompanied by exhibitions and video / film nights. A total of 140 participants from 20 different countries showed their artwork at the festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sequences.is/?page_id=7/ History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722021958/http://sequences.is/?page_id=7%2F |date=2011-07-22 }}.

'''The Singerman list''' is a numeric cataloging system for [[antisemitica]] items, as defined by the 1982 [[bibliography|bibliographic]] listing, ''Antisemitic Propaganda: an annotated bibliography and research guide'' by [[Robert Singerman]]. The list consists of a [[chronological]] listing, by year at least, of books, [[pamphlet]]s, and other sorts of texts, with full bibliographic information. In addition each item is assigned a unique 4-digit number with a short, paragraph-length, annotation. For example, "Singerman 0121" identifies uniquely a particular [[impression (publishing)|imprint]] of ''[[The Jewish Bolshevism]]''.

Most imprints of the ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', not just [[first edition]]s, that were published in Europe or the [[United States]] are listed and uniquely identified, as are many other noteworthy antisemitic publications.

The book's [[foreword]] is by [[Colin Holmes (British historian)|Colin Holmes]]. As of 2007, the work is [[out of print]].

The book is used extensively by [[rare book]] dealers and [[antiquarians]] specializing in antisemitica in precisely identifying [[first edition]]s and [[rare book]]s or [[impression (publishing)|imprint]]s sought after by [[book collector]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2007}}

{{main|Vincent van Gogh|Vincent van Gogh chronology}}
'''''Still life paintings by Vincent van Gogh (Paris)''''' is the subject of many drawings, sketches and paintings by [[Vincent van Gogh]] in 1886 and 1887 after he moved to [[Montmartre]] in Paris from the Netherlands. While in Paris, Van Gogh transformed the subjects, color and techniques that he used in creating [[still life]] paintings.

He saw the work and met the founders and key artists of [[Impressionism]], [[Pointillism]] and other movements and began incorporating what he learned into his work.  [[Japanese art]], [[Ukiyo-e]], and [[woodcut print|woodblock prints]] also influenced his approach to composition and painting.

There was a gradual change from the somber mood of his work in the Netherlands to a far more varied and expressive approach as he began introducing brighter color into his work. He painted many still life paintings of flowers, experimenting with color, light and techniques he learned from several different modern artists before moving on to other subjects.

By 1887, his work incorporated several elements of modern art as he began to approach his mature oeuvre.  Excellent examples are the ''[[#Pairs of Shoes|Pairs of Shoes]]'' paintings, where in the space of four paintings one can observe the difference between the first pair of boots made in 1886, similar to some of his earlier [[Peasant Character Studies (Van Gogh series)|peasant paintings from Nuenen]], to the painting made in 1887 that incorporates complementary, contrasting colors and use of light.  Another example are the ''[[#Blue vase|Blue Vases]]'' paintings made in 1887 that incorporate both color and technique improvements that result in uplifting, colorful paintings of flowers.

In the spring of 1887, Van Gogh left the city proper for a visit to Asnières with his friend [[Émile Bernard]].  While there his work was further transformed stylistically and through the use of bright, contrasting color and light.  See his works from [[Asnières (Van Gogh series)|Asnières]] and [[Seine (Van Gogh series)|Seine]].

==Background==
{{See also|Still life paintings by Vincent van Gogh (Netherlands)}}

===Netherlands===
From 1880 to 1885, Van Gogh began working as an artist in earnest. He was influenced not only by the great [[Dutch masters]] but also to a considerable extent by his cousin-in-law [[Anton Mauve]] a Dutch realist painter and a leading member of the [[Hague School]].&lt;ref name=Wallace40&amp;69&gt;[[#Wallace|Wallace]] pp. 40, 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh's palette consisted mainly of dark earth tones, particularly dark brown.  His brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], an art dealer, commented that his work was too somber to be marketable and encouraged him to explore modern art, particularly [[Impressionism]] for its bright, colorful paintings.&lt;ref name=Tralbaut&gt;Tralbaut pp.123-160&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Modern art===
In 1886, Van Gogh left the Netherlands and traveled to Paris to explore emerging artistic movements under the guidance and continued support of his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo van Gogh]], an art dealer.&lt;ref name=Wallace40&amp;69 /&gt; Surprised that Vincent had come to Paris unannounced, and in opposition to their conversations about timing of his arrival, Vincent stayed in Theo's apartment on Rue Laval until a larger apartment could be acquired.&lt;ref name=Beaujean28&gt;Beaujean, 28&lt;/ref&gt; For four months, Van Gogh studied with [[Fernand Cormon]], painting plaster casts, live nude models and props available at Cormon's studio.  Cormon also encouraged open-air painting.  There me met [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Émile Bernard]], and [[Louis Anquetin]].&lt;ref name=Beaujean27-28&gt;Beaujean, 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; Through Theo and artistic social circles he also met [[Edgar Degas]], [[Camille Pissarro]],&lt;ref name=Beaujean38&gt;Beaujean, 38&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Signac]], [[Georges Seurat]],&lt;ref name=Beaujean31-32&gt;Beaujean, 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul Gauguin]].  Through the fellowship with these men, he was introduced to [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]], [[Pointillism|Pointillists]], and [[Japanese art]], [[Ukiyo-e]], and [[woodcut print]]s.&lt;ref name=Wallace40&amp;69 /&gt; In spite of his unusual manner, disheveled clothes and often time frightening manner, Paris was the one place where Van Gogh developed friendships with other artists.  So much so that when Toulouse-Lautrec heard disparaging remarks against Van Gogh, he challenged the man to a duel.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, 40, 50-51&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing and trading artwork with the Parisian avant-garde artists, Van Gogh understood what Theo had been trying to tell him for years about modern art.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, 42&lt;/ref&gt; He was able to experiment with each of the movements to develop his own style, becoming what some say is "one of the most important artists in modern art."&lt;ref name=Beaujean27-28/&gt;

====Romanticism====
[[Romanticism]] was an art and literature movement formed by people looking to escape the drab world.  Its characteristics are paintings of "exotic lands" with grandiose feeling and intense color.&lt;ref name=Munro216-217&gt;Munro, 216-217&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolphe Joseph Thomas Monticelli]] developed a highly individual [[Romanticism|Romantic]] style of painting with richly colored, dappled, and textured painting and glazed surfaces.&lt;ref name=Silverman438&gt;Silverman, 438&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolphe Joseph Thomas Monticelli|Monticelli]] was a French painter of the generation preceding the Impressionists who was friends with [[Narcisse Diaz]], a member of the [[Barbizon school]], and the two often painted together in the [[Fontainebleau Forest]]. [[Vincent van Gogh]], greatly admired his work after seeing it in Paris when he arrived there in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codart.nl/exhibitions/details/1581/ Van Gogh and Monticelli Exhibition] Retrieved 24 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Van Gogh was influenced by the richness that he perceived in Monticelli's work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/542.htm 1888 24 April, Letter to Theo]&lt;/ref&gt; In  1890, Van Gogh and his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]] were instrumental in publishing the first book about Monticelli.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, 314.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kunstmuseumbasel.ch/en/exhibitions/archive/van-gogh0/vincent-van-gogh-biography/ Bio Kunstmuseum Basel] Retrieved 5 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Impressionism====
The [[Impressionism]] movement was a change from traditional artistic techniques.  With Impressionism the intention was to depict colors and images the way they are seen, not the way that artists were taught to paint them.  Aspects of Impressionism include using gleaming spots of light, color in shadows, colors straight from the tube in dots or dashes, and dissolving firm outlines.&lt;ref name=Beaujean30&gt;Beaujean, 30&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Neo-impressionism====
Van Gogh was influenced by Impressionists [[Edgar Degas]] and [[Claude Monet]], but even more so by Neo-impressionist [[Georges Seurat]], partly because of the use of dots of contrasting colors to intensify the image, a technique called [[Pointillism]].  Van Gogh likened painting with constructing small, thoughtfully placed dashes of color to writing "words in a speech or a letter".&lt;ref name=Beaujean31&gt;Beaujean, 31&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Cloisonnism====
[[Cloisonnism]] is a style of [[Post-impressionism|Post-impressionist]] painting with bold and flat forms separated by dark contours. The term was coined by critic Edouard Dujardin on occasion of the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]], in March 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Dujardin, Édouard: ''Aux XX et aux Indépendants: le Cloisonismé'' (sic!), Revue indépendante, Paris, March 1888, pp. 487-492&lt;/ref&gt; Artists [[Émile Bernard]], [[Louis Anquetin]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Paul Sérusier]], and others started painting in this style in the late 19th century. The name evokes the technique of [[cloisonné]], where wires (cloisons or "compartments") are soldered to the body of the piece, filled with powdered glass, and then fired. Many of the same painters also described their works as [[Synthetism]] a closely related movement.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 105-106&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Post-impressionism====
[[Post-Impressionism]] is the term coined by the British artist and [[art critic]] [[Roger Fry]] in 1910 to describe the development of French art since [[Édouard Manet|Manet]]. Fry used the term when he organized the 1910 exhibition ''Manet and Post-Impressionism''. Post-Impressionists extended [[Impressionism]] while rejecting its limitations: they continued using vivid colours, thick application of paint, distinctive brush strokes, and real-life subject matter, but they were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, to distort form for expressive effect, and to use unnatural or arbitrary colour.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 228-231&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Japanese Ukiyo-e====
Characteristic features of ''[[Ukiyo-e]]'' woodprints include their ordinary subject matter, the distinctive cropping of their compositions, bold and assertive outlines, absent or unusual perspective, flat regions of uniform colour, uniform lighting, absence of ''[[chiaroscuro]]'', and their emphasis on decorative patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=25340&amp;lang=en |title=Japonisme |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; One or more of these features can be found in numbers of Vincent's paintings from his Antwerp period onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=2122&amp;subpage=2124&amp;collection=621&amp;lang=en#moretotell |title=The Japanese Print Collection |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=2122&amp;collection=621&amp;lang=en |title=More Japan |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Gogh wrote, "If we study Japanese art, we see a man who is undoubtedly wise, philosophical and intelligent, who spends his time… studying a single blade of grass.  But this blade of grass leads him to draw every plant, and then the seasons, the wide aspects of the countryside, then animals, then the human figure… isn't it almost a true religion which these simple Japanese teach us, who live in nature as though they themselves are flowers.  And you cannot study Japanese art, it seems to me, without becoming much gayer and happier."&lt;ref name=Fell1997-79&gt;Fell (1997), 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Color theory and technique===
[[File:RBG color wheel.svg|thumb|280px|left|"Chromatic diagram" based on the [[RYB color model]], showing [[complementary color]]s and other relationships:
# '''Complementary''' - Colors directly across from one another are complementary, or contrasting colors, which when placed side-by-side intensified the impact of each color (example: blue and yellow).
# '''Harmonious''' - Colors next to another color on the color wheel are used together create a feeling of harmony (example: magenta, rose and red).
# '''Trio''' - A set of three colors forming a triangle in the wheel, such as red, blue and green, make interesting color combinations.]]
One of the most transformational elements of Van Gogh's work during his period in Paris was his use of color.  Van Gogh used complementary, contrasting colors to bring an intensity to his work.  Two complementary colors of the same degree of vividness and brightness placed next to one another produce an intense reaction, called the "law of simultaneous contrast."&lt;ref&gt;Fell (2005) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Georges Seurat 002.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Georges Seurat]], ''Farm Girl Sitting in a Meadow'', c. 1882-1883, [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]]]From his days in the [[Netherlands]] Van Gogh became familiar with [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]]'s color theory and was fascinated by color.&lt;ref name=Wallace39&amp;75&gt;[[#Wallace|Wallace]] pp. 39, 75&lt;/ref&gt; While in [[Nuenen]] Van Gogh became familiar with [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]]'s laws in weaving to maximize the intensity of colors through their contrast to adjacent colors.&lt;ref name=Silverman140&gt;Silverman, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris, Van Gogh eagerly studied [[Georges Seurat|Seurat]]'s use of complementary colors. Excited to try out complementary studies, Van Gogh would divide a large canvas into several rectangular sections, trying out "all the colors of the rainbow."&lt;ref name=Wallace39&amp;75 /&gt; There he was also exposed through his brother Theo to [[Adolphe Joseph Thomas Monticelli|Adolphe Monticelli]]'s still life work with flowers, which he admired.  He saw Monticelli's use of color as an expansion of Delacroix's theories of color and contrast.  He also admired the effect Monticelli created by heavy application of paint.&lt;ref name=Silverman438/&gt;

In the still life series, particularly of flowers, Van Gogh experimented with color relationship, such as complementary, contrasting colors which are colors across from one another on the color wheel.  A second color relationship, harmonious colors are colors adjacent to one another on the color wheel.  He also used the trio of colors, where the relationship on the color wheel forms a triangle.

===Balls of yarn===
To help him choose colors for his studies, Van Gogh collected strands of different shades of yarn to experiment with color combinations.  He rolled selected strands together into balls in combinations matching specific paintings, such as the yellow and ocher combinations found in ''Still Life with Quince Pears and Lemons'' (F383). The box and his sample balls of yarn have survived and are held by the [[Van Gogh Museum]].&lt;ref name="VGM383"/&gt;

===Still life===
[[File:Van Gogh - Vase mit Pfingstrosen.jpeg|thumb|190px|''Vase of Peonies'', 1886, Private collection (F666a)]]Soon after Van Gogh arrived in Paris, he began painting still lifes with the goal of experimenting with contrasting colors. He wrote to a friend in England that his goal was to create "intense coloration, not gray harmony."&lt;ref name=VGM234&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=1769&amp;collection=621&amp;lang=en |title=Vase with Autumn Asters, 1886  |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His started with still lifes of flowers.  At first his [[still life]]s maintained the subdued tones that he used in the Netherlands.  The more he became immersed in his painting, he continually added brighter colors to his work until he was using colors directly from the tube.  Then he moved on to other subjects from everyday life that reflect his use of vivid colors and a free brushstroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=2230&amp;subpage=2232&amp;collection=621&amp;lang=en#moretotell |title=Still Lifes as Color Studies |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh courted [[Agostina Segatori]], the owner of the [[Café du Tambourin]] on the [[boulevard de Clichy]], for a period of time and gave her paintings of flowers, "which would last for ever".&lt;ref name=MdO/&gt;

The energy that Van Gogh put into his Still Life paintings is representative of his habit for "working systematically, concentrating on a theme until he had exhausted it."&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flowers==
Flowers were the subject of many of Van Gogh's paintings in Paris, due in great part to his regard for flowers.  Knowing Van Gogh's interest in making still life paintings of flowers, friends and acquaintances in Paris sent bouquets of flowers weekly for his paintings.&lt;ref name=Mancoff32&gt;Mancoff, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; He also purchased inexpensive bouquets himself, choosing flowers in a variety of types and colors for his paintings.&lt;ref name=Mancoff29/&gt; Many of his still life paintings of flowers reflect a sense of overabundance of European still lifes, where blossoms fill the canvas, blooms spill out of the vase or stems of flowers teeter on the edge of the vase.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh carefully studied the art of [[floral design|floral arranging]], the works of [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch masters]], [[Japanese art|Japanese]] [[woodcut print]]s and [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] still life arrangements to master his paintings of flowers.&lt;ref name=Fell2001-136/&gt; Expressing his enthusiasm for the subject and the number of paintings he completed in Paris, Van Gogh wrote to his sister [[Wil van Gogh|Wil]], "I painted almost nothing but flowers so I could get used to colors other than grey - pink, soft or bright green, light blue, violet, yellow, glorious red."&lt;ref name=Mancoff2629&gt;Mancoff, p. 26, 29&lt;/ref&gt; His expertise in color, composition, texture and placement may have made an impression on [[Constance Spry]], a noted floral arranger who created guidelines for flower arranging as an art form.  She learned a great deal about "structure, style, form, balance, harmony and rhythm" from studying the paintings by great masters of flowers.&lt;ref name=Fell2001-136&gt;Fell (2001), 136&lt;/ref&gt;

The longer he was in Paris, the more he had an [[Culture of Asia|Asian]] [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] for flowers. As he said to his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]]: "You will see that by making a habit of looking at [[Japanese art|Japanese]] pictures you will come to love to make up bouquets and do things with flowers all the more."&lt;ref name=Mancoff32/&gt;

Van Gogh had an agreement with the [[Agostina Segatori Sitting in the Café du Tambourin|Agostina Segatori]] proprietress of Café du Tambourin, an establishment that catered to [[Montmartre]] artists, for meals in exchange for a few paintings each week.  Soon the walls of the café were full of floral still life paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Fell (2005), 80&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carnations===

===Chrysanthemums===
Chrysanthemums, often depicted in Japanese woodcut prints, were painted by Impressionists primarily in floral arrangements.  The most desired chrysanthemum was an autumn-blooming variety from Japan.&lt;ref name=Fell1997-125&gt;Fell (1997), 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fritillaries===
''Imperial Fritillaries in a Copper Vase'' (F213) reflects the influences of [[Neo-Impressionist]] [[Paul Signac]].  The background is painted with [[Pointillism|Pointillist]] brushwork. The painting was made with complementary, contrasting colors of blue and orange. Van Gogh was not a purist; he varied the shades of contrasting colors and chose subjects that he enjoyed, such as painting still lifes. Fritillary is a bulb that flowers in the spring with between three and ten flowers for each bulb. [[Fritillaria imperialis|Imperial fritillaries]], with an orange-red flower, were grown in French and Dutch gardens at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=MdO&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/search/commentaire/commentaire_id/fritillaires-17256.html?no_cache=1 |title= Imperial Fritillaries in a Copper Vase |year=2006 |work=Works in Focus |publisher=Musee d'Orsay |accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gladiola===
[[File:Van Gogh - Vase mit Gladiolen und Flieder.jpeg|thumb|190px|''Vase with Gladioli and Lilac'', 1886, Private collection (F286a)]] The [[Gladiolus]], plural Gladioli, was one of Van Gogh's favorite flower.  He especially enjoyed how they opened up like a fan after having been placed in a vase.&lt;ref name=Fell136&gt;Fell (2005), 136&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their height, Van Gogh liked to use Gladioli to create triangular-structured compositions,&lt;ref name=Fell2001-136/&gt; such as ''Vase with Gladioli and Carnation'' (F237) or an inverted triangle as in ''Vase with Gladioli and China Asters'' (F248a).

===Poppies===
''Vase with Red Poppies'' (F279) is another illustration of how Van Gogh used red and green primary, complementary colors to make both colors appear more intense, set before a blue background.  He paints pink in the unopened buds and sienna in the table.&lt;ref name=Mancoff26&gt;Mancoff, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh's paintings of rose, or any flowers, are evocative of his quote, "Ah, what portraits could be made from nature with photography and painting."&lt;ref name=Fell1997-44&gt;Fell (1997), 44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sunflowers===
{{main|Sunflowers (series of paintings)}}

''Two Cut Sunflowers'' (F375) is one of a sequence of four paintings that Van Gogh made in the summer of 1887. The first (Van Gogh Museum, F377) was a preparatory sketch.  Paul Gauguin had the second and third ''Two Cut Sunflower'' paintings (F375, F376) and hung them proudly in his Paris apartment above his bed.  In the mid-1890s he sold them to fund his trip to the South Seas.  The image of the four sunflowers was made on a large canvas.&lt;ref name=TheMMA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/ |title=Sunflowers |year=2000–2011 |work=Collection Database |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zinnias===
''Vase with Zinnias and Geraniums'' (F241) reflects the influence of [[Adolphe Joseph Thomas Monticelli|Adolphe Monticelli]] (1824–1886) in its vivid color and impasto paint.  Van Gogh admired, and later collected, Monticelli's work.&lt;ref name=NGO241&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artwork.php?mkey=2510 |title=Vase with Zinnias and Geraniums |year=2011 |work=Collections |publisher=National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa |accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Van Gogh had been introduced by his brother Theo to Monticelli's still life work with flowers in Paris.  He admired Monticelli's use of color as an expansion of Delacroix's theories of color and contrast.  Secondly he admired the effect Monticelli created by heavy application of paint called "[[impasto]]". It was partially Monticelli, from Marseilles, who inspired Van Gogh's southerly move to Provence in 1888.  He felt such kinship for the man, and desire to emulate his style, that he wrote in a letter to his sister Wil that he felt as if he were "Monticelli's son or his brother."&lt;ref name=Silverman438/&gt; The first owner in the [[provenance]] of this painting is "C.M. van Gogh Gallery, Amsterdam, The Netherlands", which was owned by Van Gogh's uncle and an art dealer, Cornelius Marinus van Gogh (1824–1908).&lt;ref name="NGO241"/&gt;

''Bowl with Zinnias and Other Flowers'' (F251), painted within days of ''Vase with Zinnias and Geraniums'' (F241), is evidence of Van Gogh's transition to a lighter color palette. Picking up elements of [[Impressionism]] Van Gogh painted with a more vigorous brushstroke, with thick application of paint, called "[[impasto]]" which created a three-dimensional relief.&lt;ref name=Mancoff32/&gt;&lt;ref name=NGO251&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artwork.php?mkey=3292 |title=Vase with Zinnias and Other Flowers |year=2011 |work=Collections |publisher=National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa |accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Other flowers===
Unable to pay for models to pose for portraits, Van Gogh threw himself heartily into painting still lifes of flowers, "red poppies, blue corn flowers and myosotis, white and red roses, yellow chrysanthemums."&lt;ref name=Leeuw&gt;Leeuw, PP342&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vincent Willem van Gogh 123.jpg|thumb|190px|''Bowl with Sunflowers, Roses and Other Flowers'', 1886, [[Kunsthalle Mannheim]], Mannheim, Germany (F250)]]
''Vase with Autumn Asters'' (F234) is one example of the many still lifes that Van Gogh painted after he arrived in Paris.  As he said to a friend, he wished for his paintings to take on intense colors, rather than the grey tones.&lt;ref name=VGM234/&gt; In this arrangement Van Gogh plays with harmonizing colors: rose, pink, red and brown.&lt;ref name=Mancoff37&gt;Mancoff p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

''Basket of pansies'' (F244) is an example of Van Gogh's experimentation with contrasting colors.  In this case the contrasting pair are purple and yellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=4463&amp;collection=621&amp;lang=en |title=Basket of pansies, 1886 |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also used the contrasting red in the tambourine and green in the background for the painting, also known as ''Tambourine with Pansies''.  Van Gogh found pansies an example of natural color theory.&lt;ref name=Mancoff29&gt;Mancoff, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vase with Hollyhocks'' (F235) was painted in the summer in contrasting shades of red and green.  Van Gogh believed that he could express the season of the year by the colors that he used in his work.  He experimented in this painting with creating an image that was nearly one-dimensional.  The decorative jug used in this painting also appears in Van Gogh's ''Vase with Autumn Asters'' (F234).&lt;ref name=Mancoff29/&gt;  [[Alcea|Hollyhocks]], native to China and Japan, were favored by [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] "for their spire-like growth, deeply-lobed green leaves and their satiny, cup-shaped flowers that hug the upper flower stem."&lt;ref name=Fell1997-125/&gt;

===Blue vase===
[[File:Van Gogh - Vase mit Margeriten und Anemonen.jpeg|thumb|190px|''Vase with Daisies and Anemones'', 1887, [[Kröller-Müller Museum]], Otterlo (F323)]]''Vase with Daisies and Anemones'' (F323), also known as ''Flowers in a Blue Vase'', was painted late in Van Gogh's stay in Paris.   The vase holds a lively selection of daisies and anemones made with a range of colors.  Dark red-brown is enlivened by shades of yellow, pink and white.  He particularly works with the various shades of yellow, likely having selected colors for the combinations of color and shades that he wanted to portray.  The vase is painted in a contrasting shade of blue.  Techniques of [[Impressionism]] and [[Divisionism]] are reflected in his brushstrokes of the background, having used broken strokes and dots of color.&lt;ref name=Mancoff34&gt;Mancoff p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plants==
Van Gogh preferred to select items from daily life to portray in his still life paintings. With ''Flowerpot with Chives'' (F337) Van Gogh used a thin brush to carefully create this painting of a pot of chives.  Contrasting colors of red and orange against green are used in this work.  The background is a pattern that Van Gogh used in other works,&lt;ref name=VGM337&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=2045&amp;collection=621&amp;lang=en |title=Flowerpot with Chives, 1887  |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''[[#Lemons|Still life with Carafe and Lemons]]'' (F340).&lt;ref name=VGM340&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=2057&amp;collection=621&amp;lang=en |title=Still life with Carafe and Lemons |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the time this painting was made in 1887 and forward, Van Gogh used colorful backgrounds for his still lifes and portraits.&lt;ref name=VGM337/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Books==
''Still Life with French Novels and a Rose'' is a painting with a number of novels with bindings of contrasting colors: green against pink and red. The books are meant to represent seven Parisian novels Van Gogh owned,&lt;ref name=LtrW03/&gt; that Van Gogh described as "a great source of light", regardless of the somber literature they contain.  The dashes of lemon, pink, orange and green seem to bring life to the books, like the blossoming flower that&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, 59&lt;/ref&gt; also adds a feeling that the paintings is made for a woman.  In 1888 Van Gogh gave this painting and another to his sister, [[Wil van Gogh|Wil]] for her birthday.  The other painting was made in Arles and is titled ''Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass with a Book'' (F393).&lt;ref name=LtrW03&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/W03.htm |title=Vincent van Gogh.

''Still Life with Books'' (F335) was painted by Van Gogh on a lid of a Japanese tea box. The books are [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist novels]]: "Braves Gens" by [[Jean Richepin]], "Au Bonheur Des Dames" by [[Émile Zola]] and "La Fille Elisa" by [[Edmond de Goncourt]]. Van Gogh, an avid reader, was particularly interested by French [[Naturalism (arts)|Naturalists]]. To his sister [[Wil van Gogh|Wil]], he once wrote "they paint life as we ourselves feel it, thereby fulfilling the need we have for people to tell us the truth."&lt;ref name=VGM335&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=2033&amp;collection=621&amp;lang=en |title=Still Life with Books |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Pair of shoes==
Van Gogh made ''Pair of Shoes'' (F255) from a pair of boots he purchased at a flea market.  He wore the boots on an extended rainy walk to create the effect he wished for this painting, which may have been a tribute to the working man.  The [[Van Gogh Museum]] speculates that they may also be symbolic for Van Gogh of his "difficult passage through life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=1576&amp;collection=621&amp;lang=en |title=A Pair of Shoes, 1886 |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of his walking through mud to make the shoes look more worn and dirty, Van Gogh was known to say "Dirty shoes and roses can both be good in the same way."&lt;ref name=Beaujean35&gt;Beaujean, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh's friend and fellow artist, [[John Peter Russell]], received Van Gogh's ''Three Pairs of Shoes'' (F332) in 1886.  Russell had painted a portrait of Van Gogh that he dearly loved.  In exchange for the portrait he had given Van Gogh, Russell selected ''Three Pairs of Shoes'' and a lithograph copy of ''Worn Out (Eternity's Gate)'' (F997) that Van Gogh made in 1882.  Russell selected these works at a time when Van Gogh had begun to make more colorful work.  Russell's selections indicate that he understood who Van Gogh was and the messages about the peasant or working man that he wished to convey through his work.&lt;ref name=Galbally135&gt;Galbally, 135-137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food and drink==
[[File:WLANL - E V E - Absinthe Van Gogh Museum.jpg|thumb|190px|''Still Life with Glass of Absinthe and a Carafe'', 1887, [[Van Gogh Museum]], Amsterdam (F339)]]
''Glass of Absinthe and a Carafe'' (F339) was made by Van Gogh in a café. On the table sits a glass of absinthe, its green-yellow liquid lighter for window's sunlight and in contrast to the brown background.  The painting catches a moment in the café from a patron's perspective, with a view of pedestrians walking on the street.  [[Absinthe]] was popular to Van Gogh and other artists both as a drink, although toxic and in some cases deadly, and because of its unique color, it was also favored as a subject for paintings.&lt;ref name=VGM339&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=2069&amp;collection=621&amp;lang=en |title=Glass of Absinthe and a Carafe, 1887 |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Absinthe may have significantly contributed to Van Gogh's poor health.  When he lived in Paris, absinthe was a popular drinks among artists.&lt;ref name=Lanier80&gt;Lanier, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Signac]] commented that Van Gogh drank steadily drinks of brandy following drinks of absinthe.&lt;ref name=Lanier93&gt;Lanier, 93.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Van Gogh left Paris he was in very poor health and known to say to a friend that drinking and smoking left him "seriously sick at heart and in body and nearly an alcoholic."&lt;ref name=Lanier80/&gt; According to author Doris Lanier, author of "Absinthe the Cocaine of the Nineteenth Century": Many of Van Gogh's symptoms following his arrival in Paris are indicative of absinthe poisoning: stomach and nervous system problems, hallucinations and convulsions.&lt;ref name=Lanier93/&gt;

[[File:Van Gogh - Stillleben mit Muscheln und Garnelen.jpeg|thumb|190px|''Still Life with Mussels and Shrimps'', 1886, [[Van Gogh Museum]], Amsterdam (F256)]]Anecdotally, one cold Parisian day Van Gogh, dressed more like a cattle drover than an urban artist, peddled a painting of pink shrimp on pink paper to a shopkeeper who sold old ironworks and inexpensive oil paintings.  Out of charity, the man gave the hungry Van Gogh five francs (less than a dollar).  Out on the street, Van Gogh saw a prostitute who had recently escaped from [[Prison Saint-Lazare]].  With thoughts of the novel about a prostitute, "La Fille Elisa" by [[Edmond de Goncourt]], Van Gogh gave her the five francs and quickly moved on his way.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, 76&lt;/ref&gt; The novel appears in Van Gogh's [[#Books|Still Life with Books]] (F335).&lt;ref name=VGM335/&gt;

===Assorted fruit===
In Van Gogh's first months in Paris, he stayed in his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo's]] small apartment on Rue Laval.  Vincent's behavior could be disruptive and unnerving to Theo and others.  A friend of Theo's wrote of Vincent, "The man hasn't the slightest notion of social conditions.  He is always quarreling with everybody.  Consequently Theo has a lot of problem getting along with him." As means of calming himself, Vincent painted fall fruit in the autumn of 1886, which he imbues with seemingly "supernatural vitality and beauty." Multi-colored, contrasting colored brushstrokes radiate in a circle from the fruit with an "aura of electrical radiance."&lt;ref name="Maurer, 58"&gt;Maurer, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

''Still Life with Apples, Pears, Lemons and Grapes'' (F382) was Van Gogh's opportunity to explore Blanc's recommendation about combining colors: "If one brings together sulfur (yellow) and garnet (dark red), which is its exact opposite, being equidistant from nasturtium (orange) and campanula (blue-mauve), the garnet and sulfur will excite one another, because they are each others' complementaries." In the background, Van Gogh used short brushstrokes of light blue and pink, giving the impression that the fruit is sitting in a basket.  Van Gogh may have seen [[Claude Monet|Claude Monet's]] ''Still Life with Apples and Grapes'' in Paris, but while the subject matter is roughly the same, the composition is not.  Monet paints the fruit on a diagonally placed table to "anchor his composition in space."&lt;ref name=Thomson47-48&gt;Thomson, 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Having removed any form of distraction, such as a  table or background,&lt;ref name="Maurer, 58"/&gt; Van Gogh placed each piece of fruit by itself, creating a "semi-abstract, decorative effect."&lt;ref name=Thomson47-48/&gt;

''Still Life with Quinces and Lemons'' (F383) is a study in yellow.  The painting, and even the frame, are in shades of yellow, ocher and brown.  The painting also has highlights in pink, red, green and blue.  A fine example of an [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] painting, Van Gogh dedicated the painting to his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]] for his guidance and introduction to modern art.&lt;ref name=VGM383/&gt; Over the [http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=2230&amp;collection=621&amp;lang=en  yellow frame], Van Gogh painted criss-cross marks, evocative of Japanese [[calligraphy]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 48&lt;/ref&gt;  Adding a painted frame to a work of art was not unusual for painters of this time; [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Paul Signac]] also painted their frames.  What is unusual is that the painted frame remained with the painting.  In most cases the original frames were replaced over the years to suit its owner's taste.&lt;ref name=VGM383&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=2230&amp;collection=621&amp;lang=en |title=Still Life with Quinces and Lemons |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Basket of Apples'' (F99) was made in 1885 when Van Gogh experimented with [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix's]] color theory.  To his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], Van Gogh wrote: "There is a certain pure bright red for the apples, then some greenish things.  Now there are one or two apples in another color, in a kind of pink — to improve the whole.  The pink is the broken color, created by mixing the first red and green mentioned.  This is why there is a connection between the colors.  Then I painted a second contrast, in the back- and foreground.  One was given a neutral color by "breaking" blue with orange; the other the same neutral color, only this time changed by adding a little yellow."&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lemons===
''Still Life with Lemons on a Plate'' (F338) is one of the paintings that Enrica Crispino, author of "Van Gogh" uses to illustrate Van Gogh's progression in the use of light and movement from colors darkened with black to "pure color".&lt;ref name=CrispinoPT27&gt;Crispino, PT 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh made ''Still life with Carafe and Lemons'' (F340) quickly, with a very thin layer of paint that does not completely obscure the canvas.  The carafe of water catches the reflection of the papered background.  Complementary colors are used well in the painting, such as yellow lemons against its purple shadow.  The green in the foreground contrasts with the red in the background.  Van Gogh signed this still life, indicating that he was pleased with the result.&lt;ref name=VGM340/&gt;

==How Van Gogh integrated modern art concepts==

===Impressionism===
Van Gogh's work in still life reflects his emergence as an important practitioner of modern art, particularly integrating techniques of Impressionism.  The table identifies key [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] techniques and examples of how Van Gogh used them in this series of still life paintings.

{| class="wikitable sortable"
! scope="col" width="400" | [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] technique
! scope="col" width="400" | Examples in Van Gogh's work
|-
|Short, thick strokes of paint are used to quickly capture the essence of the subject, rather than its details. The paint is often applied impasto. Wet paint is placed into wet paint without waiting for successive applications to dry, producing softer edges and an intermingling of colour.||Van Gogh integrated [[Pointillism]] techniques in ''[[Imperial Fritillaries in a Copper Vase]]'' (F213).&lt;ref name=MdO/&gt; ''[[#Zinnias|Vase with Zinnias and Geraniums]]'' (F241) is an example of impasto application of paint.&lt;ref name="NGO251"/&gt;
|-
|Colors are applied side-by-side with as little mixing as possible, creating a vibrant surface. The optical mixing of colours occurs in the eye of the viewer.||''[[#Lemons|Still life with Carafe and Lemons]]'' (F340) is an example of how Van Gogh used complementary colors, side-by-side, such as yellow lemons against its purple shadow.&lt;ref name=VGM340/&gt;
|-
|Grays and dark tones are produced by mixing complementary colours. In pure Impressionism the use of black paint is avoided.||In making ''[[#Other flowers|Vase with Autumn Asters]]'' (F234) Van Gogh began to use more intense colors, rather than somber grey tones of his early work.&lt;ref name=VGM234/&gt;
|-
|The play of natural light is emphasized. Close attention is paid to the reflection of colors from object to object.||In ''[[Food and drink|Glass of Absinthe and a Carafe]]'' (F339) Van Gogh paints a glass of absinthe that is made lighter by sunlight from the cafe window.&lt;ref name=VGM339/&gt;
|-
|}

===Color relationships===
Van Gogh experimented with each of the [[#Color theory and technique|three color relationships]]:

{| class="wikitable sortable"
! scope="col" width="400" | [[#Color theory and technique|Color relationship]]
! scope="col" width="400" | Examples in Van Gogh's work
|-
|-
| Complementary, contrasting colors - colors across from one another on the color wheel || ''[[#Sunflowers|Two Cut Sunflowers]]'' (F375) is painted with the contrasting pair blue and yellow.&lt;ref name=TheMMA/&gt; ''[[#Still life|Vase of Peonies]]'', 1886, Private collection (F666a) is an example of green against pink.
|-
| Harmonious colors - adjacent colors on the color wheel  || In ''[[#Other flowers|Vase with Autumn Asters]]'' (F234) experiments with harmonizing colors: rose, pink and red.&lt;ref name=Mancoff37/&gt; ''[[#Other flowers|Still Life with Scabiosa and Ranunculus]]'', 1886, Private collection (F666) also has pink and red flowers and the background has a set of harmonious green-brown shades.
|-
| Trio of colors - colors that form a triangle on the color wheel || ''[[#Poppies|Vase with Red Poppies]]'' (F279) is another illustration of how Van Gogh the trio of red, green and blue for a visually interesting combination of colors.&lt;ref name=Mancoff26&gt;Mancoff, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|}

===Light===
Van Gogh experimented with use of light over his ten-year painting career.  A trio of still lifes shows his developing style for managing light.  At first he placed light subjects against a background, as in ''Still Life with Four Stone Bottles, Flask and White Cup'' (1884)  Then he realized the effectiveness of using "pure colors, such as in ''Still Life with Lemons on a plate'' (1887) and even more so in ''Still Life: Drawing Board, Pipe, Onions and Sealing-Wax'' (1889)."&lt;ref name=CrispinoPT27/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Later in 1887==
[[File:Van Gogh - Das Restaurant Rispal in Asniéres.jpeg|thumb|190px|''The Rispal Restaurant at Asnières'', summer, 1887
Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City (F355)]]After he made most of the still life paintings, Van Gogh left the city in April 1887 for the tranquil Parisian suburb called Asnières&lt;ref name="MdO 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/search/commentaire/commentaire_id/le-restaurant-de-la-sirene-11414.html?no_cache=1 |title=Le restaurant de la Sirène à Asnières |work=2006 |publisher=Musee d'Orsay |accessdate=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to paint with his friends and Asnières residents [[Paul Signac]] and [[Émile Bernard]].&lt;ref name=Tol10&gt;Hansen, Nichols, Sund, Knudsen, Bremen p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Asnières is located beyond the city fortifications, along the banks of the Seine and the island of Grand Jatte.  There he experimented with an even lighter, more colorful palette than used in his early [[Montmartre (Van Gogh series)|Montmartre]], Still Life and [[Still life paintings by Vincent van Gogh (Netherlands)|Dutch]] paintings&lt;ref name=Galbally145&gt;Galbally pp. 145–146&lt;/ref&gt; and more fully defined his unique brushstroke: one that was rapid with thickly painted strokes laid closely together.&lt;ref name=Beaujean32-33&gt;Beaujean, 32-33&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Swedish Arts Council (p.k.a. The Swedish National Council for Cultural Affairs) was established in 1974, in conjunction with the cultural policy
decision of that year, as a public authority with the mission of bringing to fruition the cultural policies adopted by the Riksdag and the government.{{ref|a}}{{ref|b}} Since then, the cultural policies of Sweden have been revised by the Riksdag a number of times. In 1996, the special significance of literature was highlighted through the adoption of a separate piece of legislation, the Library Act. In 2009 a decision to amend the principles for disbursement of state subsidies were adopted. Thus, since 2011, the regions disburse a bigger proportion of the state subsidies.&lt;ref name=history-en&gt;{{cite web|title=Swedish Arts Council|url=http://www.kulturradet.se/Documents/publikationer/2012/swedish_arts_council.pdf|publisher=Swedish Arts Council|accessdate=27 July 2014|page=5|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promoting Culture|url=http://www.kulturradet.se/upload/kr/publikationer/2000/promoting_culture.pdf|publisher=Swedish Arts Council|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation== 
The agency has about 80 people working at their [[Headquarters|office]], located at [[Filmhuset (building)|Filmhuset]] in [[Stockholm]],&lt;ref name="about-sv" /&gt; and is led by a [[board of directors]] appointed by the [[Government of Sweden|government]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7090">'''Symphony No. 3''' by [[Michael Tippett]] is a work for soprano and orchestra with text written by the composer. 

It was composed between 1970 and 1972 and received its premiere on 22 June 1972 at the [[Royal Festival Hall]], London, performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] with the soprano [[Heather Harper]] conducted by [[Colin Davis]]. 

The symphony is notable for its use of [[blues]] and its direct quotation of the opening of the finale of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]]. The work criticises the ecstatic and utopian understanding of the brotherhood of man as expressed in the ''[[Ode to Joy]]'' and instead stresses man's capacity for both good and evil.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, p.93&lt;/ref&gt; The work is consequently characterised by contrasting and conflicting parts, its overall design being "one massive antithesis".&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, p.438&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movements==

The work consists of two parts:
# Allegro non troppo e pesante (Arrest) - Allegro molto e con grande energia (Movement)
# Allegro molto - Slow Blues (Andante) - Fast blues (Allegro)

==Background==

Tippett's conception of the Third Symphony occurred during a concert in [[Edinburgh]] in 1965 during a performance of either [[Pierre Boulez]]'s [[Piano sonatas (Boulez)|Piano Sonata No. 2]]&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, p.439&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Pli selon pli]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; Tippett detected an absence of harmonic, rhythmic and melodic motion in the work. Such an approach to composition could only be utilised by Tippett if it was presented within the context of a dialectic with its opposite, hence the Third Symphony was constructed on the concepts of "arrest" and "movement" which Tippett likened to the pull and thrust of a jet engine.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, p.92&lt;/ref&gt; Parts 1 and 2 of the work, and their component sections, follow this cycle of "arrest" and "movement".

Describing its creative cycle, Tippett remarked: "The work took seven years of intermittent consideration and eventual creation. From such tiny noting of a future possibility I had to put down a kind of mnemonic shorthand, so that I could remember what I thought the structure of the whole work might be when I’d only experienced the initial moment of conception. ...a great many disjointed, unstructured notions have been noted in my own kind of verbal shorthand. ...the original spontaneous conception of “immobile” polarized against “speedy” (so ridiculously simple, but clearly having the power to initiate the creative process now apparently ready to being) was always the structuring factor. While holding these ideas in my mind over a period of years, allowing them gradually to grow, I come next to a moment when I had nearly everything in my mind except the notes. The symphony so far had a structure and balance; it had ideas about orchestration. Thus I could begin what is usually thought of as the composition. I began at the piano a search for the right sounds. Now I don’t find the precise sounds I want on the piano, but through the piano (this is after all a piece for an orchestra). But I can invent as though the orchestral score were in my head all the time."&lt;ref&gt;Mick Csaky (ed.), ‘Feelings of inner experience’, in How Does it feel? Exploring the world of your senses, (London: Thames and Hudson 1979), 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tippett wanted to avoid the "[[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]] bombast" characteristic of many finales and decided to compose the finale as a set of blues. He possessed a great admiration for [[Bessie Smith]]'s 1925 recording of ''[[St. Louis Blues (song)|St Louis Blues]]'' in particular. Tippett interpreted the repeated bass line of the blues in terms of a [[Henry Purcell|Purcellian]] ground bass, which would make the finale a form of [[passacaglia]]. The most important reason for Tippett's decision to use the blues was its ability to communicate simply and directly.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, p.439&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the time Tippett came to compose the symphony in spring 1970, he had already written the text of the four songs for the finale.&lt;ref&gt;Tippett, p.157&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s settings of Chinese poems in ''[[Das Lied von der Erde]]'' served as a precedent for Tippett of a work which articulated song text in the shape of a symphony: "I began thus to plan and organize lyrics that would have a shape - of a human being moving from innocence to experience".&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p.186&lt;/ref&gt; The symphony's text was formulated as a critical response to the sentiment embodied in [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]'s ''[[Ode to Joy]]'': Schiller's ecstatic celebration of the brotherhood of man was untenable in a century that had witnessed the [[Holocaust]], [[gulag]]s and the dropping of the atomic bomb on [[Hiroshima]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, p.122&lt;/ref&gt; In the dramatic fourth song, therefore, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is quoted three times at climactic points and its message is challenged in the text and music of the work. Tippett's confrontation with Beethoven is suggested from the outset of the piece, the abrupt chords in the first bar being reminiscent of the opening of Beethoven's own [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 3]].&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, p.441&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscript==
The Third Symphony is certainly one Tippett’s most peculiar looking manuscripts, and his notational practices deserve closer inspection as they reveal how his conceptual design and the compositional strategies he required to deliver it demanded he entirely re-conceive the orchestra, even his own re-conceptualized post-Priam orchestra found in his Concerto for Orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Schuttenhelm, ''The Orchestral Music of Michael Tippett: Creative Development and the Compositional Process'' (London: Cambridge University Press, 2013) 239.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The manuscript of the work is in the Tippett Collection (Add MS 61796-61798) of the [[British Library]].

'''''The Fountain of Indolence''''' is an [[oil painting]] by the English artist [[J. M. W. Turner]]. First exhibited in 1834, it is now in the collection of the [[Beaverbrook Art Gallery]] in [[Fredericton]], New Brunswick, Canada.

==Subject==
The painting depicts a scene described in Canto 1 of [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]]'s 1748 poem ''[[The Castle of Indolence]]''.&lt;ref name=Mitchell&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Sebastian|title=James Thomson's picture collection and British history painting|journal=Journal of the History of Collections|date=2011|volume=23|issue=1|pages=127–151|doi=10.1093/jhc/fhq017|quote=Turner was the most prominent of many nineteenth-century painters to admire Thomson's verse.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Thus easy-rob'd, they to the fountain sped&lt;br /&gt;
That in the middle of the court up-threw&lt;br /&gt;
A stream, high spouting from its liquid bed,&lt;br /&gt;
And falling back again in drizzly dew;&lt;br /&gt;
There each deep draughts, as deep he thirsted drew;&lt;br /&gt;
It was a fountain of [[nepenthe]] rare;&lt;br /&gt;
Whence, as Dan Homer sings, huge pleasaunce grew,&lt;br /&gt;
And sweet oblivion of vile earthly care;&lt;br /&gt;
Fair gladsome waking thoughts, and joyous dreams more fair.&lt;ref name=RPO&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomson|first=James|title=The Castle of Indolence Canto 1|url=http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poems/castle-indolence-canto-i|work=RPO: Representative poetry online|publisher=University of Toronto Libraries|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It shows an imaginary landscape with [[Classical architecture|Classical]] buildings and ruins centred on the fountain, around and within which human and winged [[Cupid]]-like figures are grouped.

==History==
''The Fountain of Indolence'' was first exhibited at the 66th [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]] Exhibition at [[Somerset House]] in May 1834, to a generally favourable reception.&lt;ref name=Butlin&gt;{{cite book|last=Butlin|first=Martin|title=The Paintings of J.M.W. Turner|date=1977|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|author2=Joll, Evelyn |pages=185–186|quote=The critics recognized that it was a work of imagination and thus were willing to allow Turner more license than normal in the use of colours.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;{{cite journal|title=Exhibition of the Royal Academy|journal=Arnold's Magazine of the Fine Arts|volume=IV|series=New Series|issue=7|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gl0oAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22fountain%20of%20indolence%22&amp;pg=PA144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent history of the painting is unknown until 1882, when it was sold to [[Thomas Agnew &amp; Sons]] by H. Lumley. [[William Henry Vanderbilt]] then purchased it from Agnew and it remained in the Vanderbilt family until 1958. [[George W. Vanderbilt]] loaned it to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] for an exhibition of British paintings in 1907.&lt;ref name=Zalewski&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zalewski|first=Leanne|title=Art for the public: William Henry Vanderbilt's cultural legacy|journal=Nineteenth-Century Art Worldwide|date=Summer 2012|volume=11|issue=2|url=http://www.19thc-artworldwide.org/summer12/leanne-zalewski-william-henry-vanderbilts-cultural-legacy|accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] was actively seeking a "first-rate" Turner painting for the Beaverbrook Art Gallery, which was to open the following year in Fredericton. He purchased ''The Fountain of Indolence'' from the dealers Leggatt Brothers of London.&lt;ref name=Poitras&gt;{{cite book|last=Poitras|first=Jacques|title=Beaverbrook: A Shattered Legacy|date=2007|publisher=Goose Lane Editions|location=Fredericton, New Brunswick|isbn=9780864925220}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|87}} The painting became central to a dispute that developed in 2004 between the Gallery and the Beaverbrook UK Foundation, which claimed ownership of 133 paintings that had been acquired by Lord Beaverbrook for the Gallery. The Foundation proposed to take back and sell ''The Fountain of Indolence'', which [[Sotheby's]] had valued in 2002 at between $16.7 and $25&amp;nbsp;million in Canadian funds.&lt;ref name=Poitras /&gt; {{rp|203}}The Gallery denied that the Foundation owned the paintings, maintaining that they all belonged to the Gallery. Both sides agreed to submit to [[arbitration]], which resulted in a 2007 ruling that 85 of the paintings, including ''The Fountain of Indolence'', belonged to the Gallery, while the remaining 48 belonged to the Foundation. The Foundation appealed the ruling, but it was confirmed by an appeal panel in 2009.&lt;ref name=CBC&gt;{{cite news|title=Fredericton gallery wins appeal over Beaverbrook collection|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-gallery-wins-appeal-over-beaverbrook-collection-1.861680|accessdate=4 February 2014|newspaper=CBC News New Brunswick|date=9 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Fountain of Fallacy''==

The gap in the [[provenance]] of ''The Fountain of Indolence'' between 1834 and 1882 lends credence to the theory that it is identical with ''The Fountain of Fallacy'', a painting which Turner exhibited at the [[British Institution]] in 1839, accompanied by four lines from his own poem entitled ''Fallacies of Hope''.&lt;ref name=Wildman&gt;{{cite web|last=Wildman|first=Stephen|title=Fountain of Fallacy|url=http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/notes/b129vgim.htm|work=The Electronic Edition of John Ruskin's Modern Painters I|publisher=The Ruskin Research Centre, Lancaster University|accessdate=5 February 2014|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Its Rainbow-dew diffused fell on each anxious lip,&lt;br /&gt;
Working wild fantasy, imagining;&lt;br /&gt;
First, Science in the immeasurable Abyss of thought,&lt;br /&gt;
Measured her orbit slumbering. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Contemporary descriptions of the ''Fountain of Fallacy'' apply equally well to ''The Fountain of Indolence''. In 1839, the year it was exhibited, Turner wrote to a Mr. Marshall that ''The Fountain of Fallacy'' was for sale for 400 guineas and that he had no other painting of that size for sale. No subsequent ownership history of ''The Fountain of Fallacy'' is known and the only recorded references to it after its first exhibition are two comments by [[John Ruskin]]. According to Turner expert [[Martin Butlin]], in the [[catalogue raisonné]] ''The Paintings of J.M.W. Turner'', the available evidence indicates "that in fact there was – and is – only one" picture.&lt;ref name=Butlin2&gt;{{cite book|last=Butlin|first=Martin|title=The Paintings of J.M.W. Turner|date=1977|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|author2=Joll, Evelyn |pages=206–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Waterseller of Seville''''' is the title of three paintings by Spanish artist [[Diego Velázquez]], dating from 1618–1622. The original version is considered to be among the finest works of the painter's Seville period and is displayed in the Waterloo Gallery of [[Apsley House]].

==History==
The painting exists in three versions. The version in the [[Apsley House]], [[London]], [[United Kingdom]], was originally housed in the Royal Spanish Collection but stolen by [[Joseph Bonaparte]] at the time of the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic wars]]. [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|The Duke of Wellington]] later won it back – along with 82 other paintings – at the [[Battle of Vitoria]]. The [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|King of Spain]] allowed him to keep them in return for beating the French. Wellington brought the painting back to England where it remains to this day, in [[Apsley House]], his former home. This version is hung in the [[Waterloo Gallery]] in the museum side of the House (the current Duke of Wellington holds several private rooms still) so can be viewed by the public. 

The version in the [[Uffizi Gallery]] of [[Florence]], painted two to four years earlier, has a rather more [[burlesque]] feel, with the seller wearing an ornate red hat. This may have been more in line with Velázquez's contemporaries' expectations due to the comical and devious image of the waterseller given in [[picaresque novel]]s of the time.

The third version, takes yet another angle on the waterseller. In this he appears almost despairing in his expression, perhaps to the extent of appearing farcical. The brilliant colours used are the most extreme of the three (with the pots taking on an altogether more shiny appearance). However, as in the Uffizi version, the characters lack the depth of personality present in the Wellington version.

==Description==
The subject of the painting is the waterseller, a common trade for the lower classes in Velázquez's Seville. The jars and victuals recall the [[bodegón]] paintings. The seller has two customers: a young boy, possibly painted from the same model as used for the boys in ''[[The Lunch (Velázquez)|The Lunch]]'' and ''[[Old Woman Cooking Eggs (Velázquez)|Old Woman Cooking Eggs]]'', and a young man in the background shadows, (time has caused him to fade somewhat – he is clearer in the [[Uffizi]] version).

In the foreground sit the seller's gigantic pots of water, glistening with splashes of water. So large and rounded, they almost protrude out of the painting into the observer's space. The seller hands a freshly poured glass of water to the boy. In it sits a fig, a perfumer intended to make the water taste fresher (something still done in [[Seville]] today).

The still, calm scene – a typical quality of his genre scenes and, indeed, much of [[:Category:Paintings by Diego Velázquez|Velázquez's work]] – is remarkable for the depiction of the seller. His pensive face, battered by its direct exposure to sunlight and deeply scarred with the wrinkles of age, speaks of long years of experience. His short shaved hair and old plain clothes give him the appearance of a monk, saint, or eccentric philosopher. He gazes into nothing, indicating deep thought, almost unaware of those around him.

Velázquez's respect for the poor is evidence in the idea that the simple, elemental nature of poverty is profound and effective in depicting higher subjects and morals such as biblical stories (such as the ''[[Christ in the House of Martha and Mary (Velázquez)|Christ in the House of Martha and Mary]]'').

Another proponent of this idea was [[Caravaggio]], who significantly influenced this painting. Caravaggio went against the idealistic trends of [[Mannerism]] and the [[Renaissance]], painting saints and divine beings as fallible cripples and prostitutes. Whilst not as aggressively provocative as Caravaggio, Velázquez does not by any means idealize his subject. Rather, he aims to represent it in a way that is precisely faithful to life. He captures the imperfections of the seller's pots, the dampness on their sides, the glistening of the light on the small drops of water and the glass, and the realistic expressions of the characters.

In the context of Velázquez's development as an artist, ''The Waterseller'' exhibits the beginnings of the technique found in the artist's mature creations. His insight into the person of the seller is symptomatic of his insight into the subjects of his great portraits, and his precise rendition of the small details of reality demonstrate his understanding of human perception.

'''''The Woman with the Spider's Web''''' (or '''''The Woman with the Spider's Web between Bare Trunks''''', German: '''''Die Frau mit dem Spinnennetz zwischen kahlen Bäumen''''') is a small 1803 print by the [[German Romanticism|German Romantic]] painter [[Caspar David Friedrich]], made into a woodcut by his brother Christian Friedrich, a carpenter and furniture maker, the same year.&lt;ref name="bm"&gt;"[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1437877&amp;partId=1 The woman with the spider's web between bare trunks / Melancholy]". [[British Museum]]. Retrieved 29 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The image explores themes of death and the transience of life. It shows a woman sitting alone under an eerie, barren, dead tree in which the upper branches appear as if scattering crows. The lower ground is surrounded by encroaching and engulfing weeds, which reflecting her despair, seem as if about to envelope her. She rests one arm on a branch of the tree as she looks mournfully and enigmatically out towards the far distance, perhaps looking towards an uncertain future, or as has been suggested, in waiting for the return of a long lost lover.

The image was influenced by both [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s [[engraving]] ''[[Melencolia&amp;nbsp;I]]'' (1514) and from characters from the [[Romanticism|romantic]] writings of [[Ludwig Tieck]]. It is part of a series that Christian cut from Caspar's drawings,&lt;ref&gt;Other works from this series include the similarly themed ''Woman with a Raven near an Abyss''. See Wolf, 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="met"&gt;"[https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/365099 Seated Woman with a Spider's Web (Die Frau mit dem Spinnennnetz zwischen kahlen Baumen)]". [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Retrieved 29 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; however, Caspar appears to have been unhappy with the outcome and when asked by his brother to produce further works for transfer, he declined, writing, "ask another artist".

Original cuts of ''Woman with the Spider's Web'' are in the [[British Museum]], London, and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York, amongst other locations.

==Description and theme==

The image shows a female figure sitting by a dead tree as she solemnly looks into the distance, away from the viewer.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt; Her elbow rests on a broken tree branch, while, according to art historian [[Albert Boime]], "all around her weeds have sprung up (including the sickening thistles, traditional symbols of melancholy)".&lt;ref name="b543"&gt;Boie, 543&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the overgrown weeds are unnaturally oversized. Above her a spider has weaved a rather gothic looking web, into which an approaching insect is about to be entangled.&lt;ref name="b543" /&gt;

But while Dürer's image was concerned with creative activity and the nature of scientific activity, Friedrich evokes a sense of mourning, and themes around the brevity and transience of life.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/caspar-david-friedrich-the-woman-with-the-spider-s-web-a-woodcut/_QGQtM7g-7oXRg Caspar David Friedrich, The woman with the spider's web, a woodcut]". ''artsandculture''. Retrieved 29 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The ephemeral nature of existence is suggested by the flowers and the spider's web. However it may be simplistic to conclude that Friedrich felt a sense of hopefulness when considering death. According to the contemporary theorist of [[Early German Romanticism]],  [[Georg Philipp Friedrich Freiherr von Hardenberg|Novalis]], "death is the romanticizing principle of our life. Death is - Life. Life is strengthened by death", and thus the artist may have found solace and reinforcement when composing the image.&lt;ref name="w15"&gt;Wolf, 15&lt;/ref&gt;

German Romanticism was in part founded on nationalism and historical pride, which perhaps explains why Friedrich reached back to Dürer's 16th century engraving. The drawing may have been influenced by [[Ludwig Tieck]]'s stories, particularly his 1797 [[fairy tale]] "[[Der Blond Eckbert]]", which contains passages where Eckbert's wife, Bertha, is abandoned by her husband and becomes stranded on an isolated mountain top, while she yearningly reflects on moments from their her youth.&lt;ref name="b543" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2432">'''Willie Mulvagh''', lover of [[Nora Barnacle]], 1881 - 195?

Mulvagh was born in Mary Street, [[Galway]], and worked in the town's mineral company as an accountant. One day he accosted Nora on O'Brien's Bridge and asked her to go out with him. Initially unattracted, Nora accepted his offer as young women needed to be accompanied to the local dances, and Nora and her friends loved dancing. However, in turn of the century Galway it was not acceptable for Catholic girls to be courted by Protestant boys. Subterfuge was necessitated, aided by Nora's friend, Mary.

Mulvagh has become well known by readers of [[Molly Bloom]]'s [[monologue]] in ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' with the line ''"Mulveys was the first."'' What exactly he was the first to do remains unknown. [[Brenda Maddox]] speculates that ''"it seems as if Willie Mulvagh may have been the first to instruct Nora in the art of pleasing a man without losing her virtue ... posterity is entitled to suspect that the young man from the mineral water factory and Nora Barnacle ventured further in their embraces than Nora revealed to her girlfriend waiting the Abbey Church's pews."''

The immediate result of this was a severe punishing of Nora by her uncle Tommy Healy; he beat her with his thorn stick until she fell. Nora later gave this as the main reason for her decision to run away to [[Dublin]].

Mulvagh himself converted to marry his Catholic wife three years later, as did his brothers. However, he never forgot Nora:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Twice a widower, Willie lived on until the 1950s and in his last years made his home in England with his daughter. He was a silent man who never spoke about his past, never read books and had not the faintest idea that he was in ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''. His daughter was all the more startled one day, therefore, when Willie looked up from his newspaper, his memory apparently jogged by something he had read, and asked "James Joyce? Didn't he marry a Galway girl by the name of Barnacle?"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
