'''Sir Alfred Jules''' "'''Freddie'''" '''Ayer''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=on|FBA|size=100%}} ({{IPAc-en|ɛər}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ayer "Ayer"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 29 October 1910&amp;nbsp;– 27 June 1989),&lt;ref name="BioDict20CPhil"&gt;{{cite book |title=Biographical Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Philosophers |year=1996 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |pages=37–39 |isbn=0-415-06043-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually cited as '''A. J. Ayer''', was a British philosopher known for his promotion of [[logical positivism]], particularly in his books ''[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]'' (1936) and ''The Problem of Knowledge'' (1956).

He was educated at [[Eton College]] and [[Oxford University]], after which he studied the philosophy of logical positivism at the [[University of Vienna]]. From 1933 to 1940 he lectured on philosophy at [[Christ Church, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://biography.yourdictionary.com/alfred-jules-ayer|title= Alfred Jules Ayer Facts|publisher= Your Dictionary|accessdate = 18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second World War]] Ayer was a [[Special Operations Executive]] and [[MI6]] agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The politics of apolitical culture: the Congress for Cultural Freedom, the CIA, and post-war American hegemony |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |author=Scott-Smith, Giles |page=109 |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-24445-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was [[Grote Chair of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic|Grote Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic]] at [[University College London]] from 1946 until 1959, after which he returned to Oxford to become [[Wykeham Professor]] of Logic at [[New College, Oxford|New College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alfred Jules Ayer|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ayer/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=15 April 2016|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1951 to 1952 and [[knight]]ed in 1970. He was known for his advocacy of [[humanism]], and was the second President of the [[British Humanist Association]] (now known as Humanists UK).

== Life ==
Ayer was born in [[St John's Wood]], in north west London, to a wealthy family from continental Europe. His mother, Reine Citroën, was from the Dutch-Jewish family who founded the [[Citroën]] car company in France. His father, Jules Ayer, was a Swiss [[Calvinist]] financier who worked for the [[Rothschild family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A.J. Ayer: A Life |author= Rogers, Ben |publisher= Vintage |location =London |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |pages= |isbn= 978-0-09-953681-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayer was educated at [[Ascham St Vincent's School]], a former boarding preparatory school for boys in the seaside town of [[Eastbourne]] in [[Sussex]], in which he started boarding at the comparatively early age of seven for reasons to do with the [[World War I|First World War]], and [[Eton College]], a boarding school in [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] (near [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]]) in [[Berkshire]]. It was at Eton that Ayer first became known for his characteristic bravado and precocity. Although primarily interested in furthering his intellectual pursuits, he was very keen on sports, particularly rugby, and reputedly played the [[Eton wall game|Eton Wall Game]] very well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A.J. Ayer: A Life |author= Rogers, Ben |publisher= Vintage |location =London |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |pages=42–44 |isbn= 978-0-09-953681-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final examinations at Eton, Ayer came second in his year, and first in classics. In his final year, as a member of Eton's senior council, he unsuccessfully campaigned for the abolition of [[School corporal punishment|corporal punishment]] at the school. He won a classics scholarship to [[Christ Church, Oxford]].

After graduation from Oxford University Ayer spent a year in Vienna, returned to England and published his first book, ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'' in 1936.  The first exposition in English of [[Logical Positivism]] as newly developed by the [[Vienna Circle]], this made Ayer at age 26 the 'enfant terrible' of British philosophy.  In the Second World War he served as an officer in the Welsh Guards, chiefly in intelligence (Special Operations Executive (SOE) and [[MI6]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/21/mi6-first-authorised-history |location=London |work =The Guardian |first=Richard |last=Norton-Taylor |title=Graham Greene, Arthur Ransome and Somerset Maugham all spied for Britain, admits MI6 |date=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;).   Ayer was commissioned [[second lieutenant]] into the [[Welsh Guards]] from Officer Cadet Training Unit on 21 September 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34957 |supp=y|page=5776|date=27 September 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war he briefly returned to [[Oxford University]] where he became a fellow and [[Dean of Wadham College]]. He thereafter taught philosophy at [[London University]] from 1946 until 1959, when he also started to appear on radio and television. He was an extrovert and social mixer who liked dancing and attending the clubs in London and New York. He was also obsessed with sport: he had played rugby for Eton, and was a noted cricketer and a keen supporter of [[Tottenham Hotspur]] football team. For an academic, Ayer was an unusually well-connected figure in his time, with close links to 'high society' and the establishment. Presiding over Oxford high-tables, he is often described as charming, but at times he could also be intimidating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Iris Murdoch as I knew her |first=A. N. |last=Wilson |publisher= Hutchinson |year=2003 |page=156 |location =London |isbn= 978-0-09-174246-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayer was married four times to three women.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{harvnb|Wollheim|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first marriage was from 1932–1941 to (Grace Isabel) Renée (d. 1980), who subsequently married philosopher [[Stuart Hampshire]], Ayer's friend and colleague.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; In 1960 he married [[Dee Wells|Alberta Constance (Dee) Wells]], with whom he had one son.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; Ayer's marriage to Wells was dissolved in 1983 and that same year he married Vanessa Salmon, former wife of politician [[Nigel Lawson]]. She died in 1985 and in 1989 he remarried Dee Wells, who survived him.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; Ayer also had a daughter with Hollywood columnist [[Sheilah Graham Westbrook]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

From 1959 to his retirement in 1978, Sir Alfred held the Wykeham Chair, Professor of Logic at Oxford. He was knighted in 1970.

Ayer died on 27 June 1989. From 1980 to 1989, Ayer lived at 51 York Street, [[Marylebone]], where a memorial plaque was unveiled on 19 November 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |title=City of Westminster green plaques|accessdate=2011-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716210428/http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |archivedate=16 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical ideas ==
In ''Language, Truth and Logic'' (1936), Ayer presents the [[verification principle]] as the only valid basis for philosophy.  Unless logical or empirical verification is possible, statements like "God exists" or "charity is good" are not true or untrue but meaningless, and may thus be excluded or ignored.  Religious language in particular was unverifiable and as such literally nonsense. He also criticises C. A. Mace's opinion&lt;ref&gt;"Representation and Expression," Analysis, Vol.1, No.3; "Metaphysics and Emotive Language," Analysis Vol. II, nos. 1 and 2,&lt;/ref&gt; that metaphysics is a form of intellectual poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Language, Truth and Logic 1946/1952, New York/Dover&lt;/ref&gt; The stance that a belief in "God" denotes no verifiable hypothesis is sometimes referred to as [[Ignosticism|igtheism]] (for example, by [[Paul Kurtz]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The New Skepticism: Inquiry and Reliable Knowledge |page=194 |author=Kurtz, Paul |authorlink=Paul Kurtz |year=1992 |publisher=Prometheus |location =Buffalo, NY |isbn= 978-0-87975-766-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years Ayer reiterated that he did not believe in God&lt;ref&gt;"I do not believe in God. It seems to me that theists of all kinds have very largely failed to make their concept of a deity intelligible; and to the extent that they have made it intelligible, they have given us no reason to think that anything answers to it." Ayer, A.J. (1966). "What I Believe," ''Humanist'', Vol.81 (8) August, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; and began to refer to himself as an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;"I trust that my remaining an atheist will allay the anxieties of my fellow supporters of the [[British Humanist Association]], the [[Rationalist Press Association]] and the [[South Place Ethical Society]]." (Ayer 1989, p. 12)&lt;/ref&gt; He followed in the footsteps of [[Bertrand Russell]] by debating with the Jesuit scholar [[Frederick Copleston]] on the topic of religion.

Ayer's version of emotivism divides "the ordinary system of ethics" into four classes:
#"Propositions that express definitions of ethical terms, or judgements about the legitimacy or possibility of certain definitions"
#"Propositions describing the phenomena of moral experience, and their causes"
#"Exhortations to moral virtue"
#"Actual ethical judgments"&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, ''Language'', 103&lt;/ref&gt;
He focuses on propositions of the first class—moral judgments—saying that those of the second class belong to science, those of the third are mere commands, and those of the fourth (which are considered in [[normative ethics]] as opposed to [[meta-ethics]]) are too concrete for ethical philosophy.

Ayer argues that moral judgments cannot be translated into non-ethical, empirical terms and thus cannot be verified; in this he agrees with [[ethical intuitionism|ethical intuitionists]]. But he differs from intuitionists by discarding appeals to intuition of non-empirical moral truths as "worthless" &lt;ref&gt;Ayer, ''Language'', 106&lt;/ref&gt; since the intuition of one person often contradicts that of another. Instead, Ayer concludes that ethical concepts are "mere pseudo-concepts":

{{quote|The presence of an ethical symbol in a proposition adds nothing to its factual content. Thus if I say to someone, "You acted wrongly in stealing that money," I am not stating anything more than if I had simply said, "You stole that money." In adding that this action is wrong I am not making any further statement about it. I am simply evincing my moral disapproval of it. It is as if I had said, "You stole that money," in a peculiar tone of horror, or written it with the addition of some special exclamation marks. … If now I generalise my previous statement and say, "Stealing money is wrong," I produce a sentence that has no factual meaning—that is, expresses no proposition that can be either true or false. … I am merely expressing certain moral sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, ''Language'', 107&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Between 1945 and 1947, together with Russell and [[George Orwell]], he contributed a series of articles to ''[[Polemic (magazine)|Polemic]]'', a short-lived British "Magazine of Philosophy, Psychology, and Aesthetics" edited by the ex-Communist [[Humphrey Slater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/arthistorical-notes-where-are-the-hirsts-of-the-1930s-now-1184514.html |title= Where are the Hirsts of the 1930s now? |work=The Independent |location =London |date=13 November 1998 |author=Buckman, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Absent Minds"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=j-OjW2JvVfAC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;vq=ayer&amp;cad=1_1#PPA396,M1 |title= Absent Minds: Intellectuals in Britain |author= Collini, Stefan |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn= 978-0-19-929105-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayer was closely associated with the British [[secular humanism|humanist]] movement. He was an Honorary Associate of the [[Rationalist Press Association]] from 1947 until his death. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1963.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 April 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110510021801/http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf| archivedate= 10 May 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, he became the first president of the Agnostics' Adoption Society and in the same year succeeded [[Julian Huxley]] as president of the [[British Humanist Association]], a post he held until 1970. In 1968 he edited ''The Humanist Outlook'', a collection of essays on the meaning of humanism. In addition he was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II|Humanist Manifesto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |title=Humanist Manifesto II |publisher=American Humanist Association |accessdate=4 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020110719/http://www.americanhumanist.org/humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |archivedate=20 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught or lectured several times in the United States, including serving as a visiting professor at [[Bard College]] in the fall of 1987. At a party that same year held by fashion designer [[Fernando Sanchez]], Ayer, then 77, confronted [[Mike Tyson]] who was forcing himself upon the (then) little-known model [[Naomi Campbell]]. When Ayer demanded that Tyson stop, the boxer said: "Do you know who the fuck I am? I'm the heavyweight champion of the world," to which Ayer replied: "And I am the former [[Wykeham Professor of Logic]]. We are both pre-eminent in our field. I suggest that we talk about this like rational men". Ayer and Tyson then began to talk, while Naomi Campbell slipped out.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=D26bGPQw0GsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A.+J.+Ayer&amp;ei=ECIPTKLSL4WyzgSbpJiaCg&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=naomi&amp;f=false Rogers (1999), p. 344].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Near-death experience ===
In 1988, shortly before his death, Ayer wrote an article entitled, "What I saw when I was dead",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ayer |first=A. J. |url=http://www.philosopher.eu/others-writings/a-j-ayer-what-i-saw-when-i-was-dead/ |title=What I Saw When I Was Dead |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing an unusual [[near-death experience]]. Of the experience, Ayer first said that it "slightly weakened my conviction that my genuine death ... will be the end of me, though I continue to hope that it will be."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Lougrhan |first=Gerry |title=Can There Be Life After Life? Ask the Atheist! |date=18 March 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few days later he revised this, saying "what I should have said is that my experiences have weakened, not my belief that there is no life after death, but my inflexible attitude towards that belief".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dennett |first=Daniel C. |url=http://edge.org/3rd_culture/dennett06/dennett06_index.html |title=THANK GOODNESS! |publisher=Edge.org |date=3 November 2006 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Dr Jeremy George, the attending physician, claimed that Ayer had confided to him: "I saw a Divine Being. I'm afraid I'm going to have to revise all my books and opinions." Ayer's son Nick, however, said that he had never mentioned this to him though he did find his father's words to be extraordinary, and said he had long felt there was something possibly suspect about his father's version of his near death experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cash |first=William |url=http://variousenthusiasms.wordpress.com/2009/04/28/did-atheist-philosopher-see-god-when-he-died-by-william-cash/ |title=Did atheist philosopher see God when he 'died'? |publisher=National Post |date=28 April 2009 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
Ayer is best known for popularising the [[verification principle]], in particular through his presentation of it in ''[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]'' (1936). The principle was at the time at the heart of the debates of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]] which Ayer visited as a young guest. Others, including the leading light of the circle, [[Moritz Schlick]], were already offering their own papers on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schlick |first=Moritz |url=http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/moritz.htm |title=Unanswerable Questions |publisher=The Philosopher |volume=XIII |year=1935 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayer's own formulation was that a sentence can only be meaningful if it has verifiable [[empirical]] import, otherwise it is either "[[Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytical]]" if [[Tautology (logic)|tautologous]], or "metaphysical" (i.e. meaningless, or "literally senseless"). He started to work on the book at the age of 23&lt;ref&gt;page ix, "Language, Truth and Logic", Penguin, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and it was published when he was 26. Ayer's philosophical ideas were deeply influenced by those of the Vienna Circle and [[David Hume]]. His clear, vibrant and polemical exposition of them makes ''Language, Truth and Logic'' essential reading on the tenets of [[logical empiricism]]– the book is regarded as a classic of 20th century [[analytic philosophy]], and is widely read in philosophy courses around the world. In it, Ayer also proposed that the distinction between a conscious man and an unconscious machine resolves itself into a distinction between 'different types of perceptible behaviour',&lt;ref&gt;page 140, ''Language, Truth and Logic'', Penguin, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; an argument which anticipates the [[Turing test]] published in 1950 to test a machine's capability to demonstrate intelligence.

Ayer wrote two books on the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], ''Russell and Moore: The Analytic Heritage'' (1971) and ''Russell'' (1972). He also wrote an introductory book on the philosophy of [[David Hume]] and a short biography of [[Voltaire]].

Ayer was a strong critic of the German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]]. As a logical positivist Ayer was in conflict with Heidegger's proposed vast, overarching theories regarding existence. These he felt were completely unverifiable through empirical demonstration and logical analysis. This sort of philosophy was an unfortunate strain in modern thought. He considered Heidegger to be the worst example of such philosophy, which Ayer believed to be entirely useless.

In 1972–1973 Ayer gave the [[Gifford Lectures]] at [[University of St Andrews]], later published as ''The Central Questions of Philosophy''. In the preface to the book, he defends his selection to hold the lectureship on the basis that Lord Gifford wished to promote "[[natural theology]]", in the widest sense of that term', and that non-believers are allowed to give the lectures if they are "able reverent men, true thinkers, sincere lovers of and earnest inquirers after truth".&lt;ref&gt;''The Central Questions of Philosophy'', p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; He still believed in the viewpoint he shared with the logical positivists: that large parts of what was traditionally called "philosophy"– including the whole of [[metaphysics]], theology and [[aesthetics]]– were not matters that could be judged as being true or false and that it was thus meaningless to discuss them.

In ''The Concept of a Person and Other Essays'' (1963), Ayer heavily criticized [[Wittgenstein]]'s [[private language argument]].

Ayer's sense-data theory in ''Foundations of Empirical Knowledge'' was famously criticised by fellow Oxonian [[J. L. Austin]] in ''[[Sense and Sensibilia (Austin)|Sense and Sensibilia]]'', a landmark 1950s work of common language philosophy. Ayer responded to this in the essay "Has Austin Refuted the Sense-data Theory?", which can be found in his ''Metaphysics and Common Sense'' (1969).

== Awards ==
He was awarded a Knighthood as [[Knight Bachelor]] in the London Gazette on 1 January 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=44999 |supp=y|page=1|date=30 December 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Autumn leaf color''' is a phenomenon that affects the normally green leaves of many [[deciduous]] [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s by which they take on, during a few weeks in the autumn season, various shades of red, yellow, purple, black, orange, pink, magenta, blue and brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usna.usda.gov/PhotoGallery/FallFoliage/ScienceFallColor.html |title=The Science of Color in Autumn Leaves |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=October 6, 2011 |website=usna.usda.gov |publisher=[[United States National Arboretum]] |access-date=18 June 2015 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503105016/http://www.usna.usda.gov/PhotoGallery/FallFoliage/ScienceFallColor.html |archive-date=2015-05-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon is commonly called '''autumn colours'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/activityandadventure/9590099/New-England-in-the-Fall-Trip-of-a-Lifetime.html |title=New England in the Fall: Trip of a Lifetime - Telegraph |last1=Wade |first1=Paul |last2=Arnold |first2=Kathy |date=16 September 2014 |website=telegraph.co.uk |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' |access-date=18 June 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''autumn foliage'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/htbg/module8/autumns_theme1.shtml |title=BBC - Gardening - How to be a gardener - The gardening year - Autumn's theme |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=17 September 2014 |website=bbc.co.uk |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=18 June 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[British English]] and '''fall colors''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/fallcolors/2014/index.shtml |title=US Forest Service - Caring for the land and serving people |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |website=fs.fed.us |publisher=[[United States Forest Service]] |access-date=18 June 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''fall foliage''' or simply '''foliage'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/projects/fall_foliage/index.shtml |title=MaineFoliage.com - Maine's Official Fall Foliage Website |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2013 |website=MaineFoliage.com|publisher=MaineFoliage.com |access-date=18 June 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[American English]].

In some areas of [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], "[[leaf peeping]]" [[tourism]] is a major contribution to economic activity. This tourist activity occurs between the beginning of color changes and the onset of [[Deciduous#Botany|leaf fall]], usually around September and October in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and April to May in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].

==Chlorophyll and the green color/yellow/orange color==

A green [[leaf]] is green because of the presence of a pigment known as [[chlorophyll]], which is inside an [[organelle]] called a [[chloroplast]]. When they are abundant in the leaf's [[cell (biology)|cells]], as they are during the growing season, the chlorophyll's green color dominates and masks out the colors of any other pigments that may be present in the leaf. Thus, the leaves of summer are characteristically green.&lt;ref name=tree1044&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Archetti |first1=Marco |last2=Döring |first2=Thomas F. |last3=Hagen |first3=Snorre B. |last4=Hughes |first4=Nicole M. |last5=Leather |first5=Simon R. |last6=Lee |first6=David W. |last7=Lev-Yadun |first7=Simcha |last8=Manetas |first8=Yiannis |last9=Ougham |first9=Helen J. |title=Unravelling the evolution of autumn colours: an interdisciplinary approach |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=24 |pages=166–73 |year=2011 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2008.10.006 |pmid=19178979 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kaiserstuhl - Herbst - Rebblatt im Gegenlicht.jpg|thumb|In this leaf, the veins are still green, while the other tissue is turning red. This produces a [[fractal]]-like pattern]]

Chlorophyll has a vital function: it captures solar rays and uses the resulting energy in the manufacture of the plant's food — simple sugars which are produced from water and [[carbon dioxide]]. These sugars are the basis of the plant's nourishment — the sole source of the [[carbohydrate]]s needed for growth and development. In their food-manufacturing process, the chlorophylls break down, thus are being continually "used up". During the growing season, however, the plant replenishes the chlorophyll so that the supply remains high and the leaves stay green.

In late summer, as daylight hours shorten and temperatures cool, the [[vein]]s that carry fluids into and out of the leaf are gradually closed off as a layer of special [[Cork (tissue)|cork]] cells forms at the base of each leaf. As this cork layer develops, water and mineral intake into the leaf is reduced, slowly at first, and then more rapidly. During this time, the chlorophyll begins to decrease. Often, the veins are still green after the tissues between them have almost completely changed color.

Much chlorophyll is in photosystem&amp;nbsp;II (light-harvesting complex&amp;nbsp;II or LHC&amp;nbsp;II), the most abundant membrane [[protein]] on earth.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} LHC&amp;nbsp;II captures light in photosynthesis. It is located in the [[thylakoid]] membrane of the chloroplast and it is composed of an [[Apoenzyme#Cofactors|apoprotein]] along with several [[ligand]]s, the most important of which are chlorophylls&amp;nbsp;a and b. In the fall, this complex is broken down. Chlorophyll degradation is thought to occur first. Recent research suggests that the beginning of chlorophyll degradation is catalyzed by chlorophyll&amp;nbsp;b reductase, which reduces chlorophyll&amp;nbsp;b to 7‑hydroxymethyl chlorophyll&amp;nbsp;a, which is then reduced to chlorophyll&amp;nbsp;a.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Horie |first1=Y. |last2=Ito |first2=H. |last3=Kusaba |first3=M. |last4=Tanaka |first4=R. |last5=Tanaka |first5=A. |title=Participation of Chlorophyll b Reductase in the Initial Step of the Degradation of Light-harvesting Chlorophyll a/b-Protein Complexes in Arabidopsis |journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=284 |issue=26 |pages=17449–56 |year=2009 |pmid=19403948 |pmc=2719385 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M109.008912}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is believed to destabilize the complex, at which point breakdown of the apoprotein occurs. An important enzyme in the breakdown of the apoprotein is FtsH6, which belongs to the FtsH family of [[protease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zelisko |first1=A. |title=AtFtsH6 is involved in the degradation of the light-harvesting complex&amp;nbsp;II during high-light acclimation and senescence |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=102 |pages=13699–704 |year=2005 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0503472102 |issue=38|bibcode = 2005PNAS..10213699Z |last2=Garcia-Lorenzo |first2=M. |last3=Jackowski |first3=G. |last4=Jansson |first4=S. |last5=Funk |first5=C. |pmid=16157880 |pmc=1224624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chlorophylls degrade into colorless [[tetrapyrrole]]s known as nonfluorescent chlorophyll catabolites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hortensteiner |first1=S. |title=Chlorophyll degradation during senescence |journal=Annual Review of Plant Biology |volume=57 |pages=55–77 |year=2006 |pmid=16669755 |doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.57.032905.105212}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the chlorophylls degrade, the hidden pigments of yellow [[xanthophyll]]s and orange [[beta-carotene]] are revealed. These pigments are present throughout the year, but the red pigments, the [[anthocyanin]]s, are [[De novo synthesis|synthesized ''de novo'']] once roughly half of chlorophyll has been degraded. The [[amino acid]]s released from degradation of light harvesting complexes are stored all winter in the tree's roots, branches, stems, and [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]] until next spring, when they are recycled to releaf the tree.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Pigments that contribute to other colors==

===Carotenoids===
[[File:Leaf color change.jpg|thumb|Cross-section of a leaf showing color changes]]
Carotenoids are present in leaves the whole year round, but their orange-yellow colors are usually masked by green chlorophyll.&lt;ref name=tree1044/&gt; As autumn approaches, certain influences both inside and outside the plant cause the [[chlorophylls]] to be replaced at a slower rate than they are being used up. During this period, with the total supply of chlorophylls gradually dwindling, the "masking" effect slowly fades away. Then other pigments that have been present (along with the chlorophylls) in the cells all during the leaf's life begin to show through.&lt;ref name=tree1044/&gt; These are [[carotenoid]]s and they provide colorations of yellow, brown, orange, and the many hues in between.

The carotenoids occur, along with the chlorophyll pigments, in tiny structures called [[plastid]]s, within the cells of leaves. Sometimes, they are in such abundance in the leaf that they give a plant a yellow-green color, even during the summer. Usually, however, they become prominent for the first time in autumn, when the leaves begin to lose their chlorophyll.

Carotenoids are common in many living things, giving characteristic color to [[carrot]]s, [[maize|corn]], [[Domestic Canary|canaries]], and [[daffodil]]s, as well as [[egg yolk]]s, [[rutabaga]]s, [[buttercup]]s, and [[banana]]s.

Their brilliant yellows and oranges tint the leaves of such hardwood species as [[hickory|hickories]], [[ash (tree)|ash]], [[maple]], [[yellow poplar]], [[aspen]], [[birch]], [[black cherry]], [[sycamore]], [[Populus sect. Aegiros|cottonwood]], [[sassafras]], and [[alder]].  Carotenoids are the dominant pigment in coloration of about 15-30% of tree species.&lt;ref name=tree1044/&gt;

===Anthocyanins===
[[File:Redmaplefoliage.jpg|thumb|right|Typical fall foliage in red maple country, the Adirondacks of New York]]
[[File:country lane.jpg|thumb|right|English country lane in the autumn]]
The reds, the purples, and their blended combinations that decorate autumn foliage come from another group of pigments in the cells called [[anthocyanin]]s. Unlike the carotenoids, these pigments are not present in the leaf throughout the growing season, but are actively produced towards the end of summer.&lt;ref name=tree1044/&gt; They develop in late summer in the [[sap]] of the cells of the leaf, and this development is the result of [[Complex adaptive system|complex]] interactions of many influences—both inside and outside the plant. Their formation depends on the breakdown of sugars in the presence of bright light as the level of [[phosphate]] in the leaf is reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

During the summer growing season, phosphate is at a high level. It has a vital role in the breakdown of the sugars manufactured by chlorophyll, but in the fall, phosphate, along with the other chemicals and nutrients, moves out of the leaf into the [[Plant stem|stem]] of the plant. When this happens, the sugar-breakdown process changes, leading to the production of anthocyanin pigments. The brighter the light during this period, the greater the production of anthocyanins and the more brilliant the resulting color display. When the days of autumn are bright and cool, and the nights are chilly but not freezing, the brightest colorations usually develop.

Anthocyanins temporarily color the edges of some of the very young leaves as they unfold from the [[bud]]s in early spring. They also give the familiar color to such common fruits as [[cranberry|cranberries]], [[Red Delicious|red apples]], [[blueberry|blueberries]], [[cherry|cherries]], [[strawberry|strawberries]], and [[plums]].

Anthocyanins are present in about 10% of tree species in temperate regions, although in certain areas&amp;nbsp;— [[Autumn in New England|most famously]] [[New England]]&amp;nbsp;— up to 70% of tree species may produce the pigment.&lt;ref name=tree1044/&gt; In autumn forests, they appear vivid in the [[maple]]s, [[oak]]s, [[sourwood]], [[Liquidambar|sweetgums]], [[dogwood]]s, [[tupelo]]s, [[cherry|cherry trees]] and [[persimmon]]s. These same pigments often combine with the carotenoids' colors to create the deeper orange, fiery reds, and bronzes typical of many hardwood species.

===Cell walls===
The brown color of leaves is not the result of a pigment, but rather cell walls, which may be evident when no coloring pigment is visible.&lt;ref name=tree1044/&gt;

==Function of autumn colors==
Deciduous plants were traditionally believed to shed their leaves in autumn primarily because the high costs involved in their maintenance would outweigh the benefits from photosynthesis during the winter period of low light availability and cold temperatures.&lt;ref name=Thomas_Stoddart&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thomas |first1=H |last2=Stoddart |first2=J L |title=Leaf Senescence |journal=Annual Review of Plant Physiology |volume=31 |pages=83–111 |year=1980 |doi=10.1146/annurev.pp.31.060180.000503}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, this turned out to be oversimplistic&amp;nbsp;— other factors involved include insect predation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Labandeira |first1=C. C. |title=Ninety-seven million years of angiosperm-insect association: paleobiological insights into the meaning of coevolution |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=91 |pages=12278–82 |year=1994 |doi=10.1073/pnas.91.25.12278 |pmid=11607501 |pmc=45420 |issue=25 |last2=Dilcher |first2=DL |last3=Davis |first3=DR |last4=Wagner |first4=DL |bibcode=1994PNAS...9112278L}}&lt;/ref&gt; water loss, and damage from high winds or snowfall.

Anthocyanins, responsible for red-purple coloration, are actively produced in autumn, but not involved in leaf-drop.  A number of hypotheses on the role of pigment production in leaf-drop have been proposed, and generally fall into two categories: interaction with animals, and protection from nonbiological factors.&lt;ref name=tree1044/&gt;

===Photoprotection===

[[File:Starr 051105-8369 Liquidambar styraciflua.jpg|right|thumb|Some trees, such as this [[Liquidambar styraciflua|American sweetgum]] at [[Keokea, Maui]], develop bold fall colors in subtropical or tropical areas.]]

According to the photoprotection theory, anthocyanins protects the leaf against the harmful effects of light at low temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=David |last2=Gould |first2=Kevin |title=Why Leaves Turn Red |journal=American Scientist |volume=90 |pages=524–531 |year=2002 |doi=10.1511/2002.6.524 |issue=6|bibcode = 2002AmSci..90..524L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1–16 |last1=Lee |first1=D |last2=Gould|first2=K |year=2002 |doi=10.1016/S0065-2296(02)37040-X |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S006522960237040X |journal=Advances in Botanical Research |volume=37 |title=Anthocyanins in leaves and other vegetative organs: An introduction |isbn=978-0-12-005937-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the leaves are about to fall, so protection is not of extreme importance for the tree. Photo-oxidation and photoinhibition, however, especially at low temperatures, make the process of reabsorbing nutrients less efficient. By shielding the leaf with anthocyanins, according to the photoprotection theory, the tree manages to reabsorb nutrients (especially nitrogen) more efficiently.

===Coevolution===
According to the [[coevolution]] theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Archetti |first1=M |title=The coevolution theory of autumn colours |journal=Proc. Biol. Sci. |volume=271 |issue=1545 |pages=1219–23 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15306345 |pmc=1691721 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.2728|last2=Brown |first2=S. P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; the colors are warning signals towards insects that use the trees as a host for the winter, for example aphids. If the colors are linked to the amount of chemical defenses against insects, then the insects will avoid red leaves and increase their fitness; at the same time, trees with red leaves have an advantage because they reduce their parasite load. This has been shown in the case of [[Malus|apple tree]]s where some domesticated apple varieties, unlike [[M. sieversii|wild ones]], lack red leaves in autumn. A greater proportion of aphids that avoid apple trees with red leaves manage to grow and develop compared to those that do not.&lt;ref name="Archetti"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Archetti |first1=M. |title=Evidence from the domestication of apple for the maintenance of autumn colours by coevolution |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=276 |pages=2575–80 |year=2009 |pmc=2684696 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.0355 |pmid=19369261 |issue=1667}}&lt;/ref&gt; A trade-off, moreover, exists between fruit size, leaf color, and aphids resistance as varieties with red leaves have smaller fruits, suggesting a cost to the production of red leaves linked to a greater need for reduced aphid infestation.&lt;ref name="Archetti"/&gt;

Consistent with red-leaved trees providing reduced survival for aphids, tree species with bright leaves tend to select for more specialist aphid pests than do trees lacking bright leaves (autumn colors are useful only in those species coevolving with insect pests in autumn).&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hamilton |first1=W. D. |last2=Brown |first2=S. P. |title=Autumn tree colours as a handicap signal |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=268 |pages=1489–93 |year=2001 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2001.1672 |pmid=11454293 |pmc=1088768 |issue=1475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coevolution theory of autumn colors was proposed by [[W. D. Hamilton]] in 2001 as an example of evolutionary [[signalling theory]].&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt; With biological signals such as red leaves, it is argued that because they are costly to produce, they are usually honest, so signal the true quality of the signaller with low-quality individuals being unable to fake them and cheat. Autumn colors would be a signal if they are costly to produce, or be impossible to fake (for example if autumn pigments were produced by the same biochemical pathway that produces the chemical defenses against the insects).{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The change of leaf colors prior to fall have also been suggested as adaptations that may help to undermine the camouflage of herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lev-Yadun |first1=Simcha |last2=Dafni |first2=Amots |last3=Flaishman |first3=Moshe A. |last4=Inbar |first4=Moshe |last5=Izhaki |first5=Ido |last6=Katzir |first6=Gadi |last7=Ne'eman |first7=Gidi |title=Plant coloration undermines herbivorous insect camouflage |journal=BioEssays |volume=26 |issue=10 |pages=1126–30 |year=2004 |pmid=15382135 |doi=10.1002/bies.20112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many plants with berries attract birds with especially visible berry and/or leaf color, particularly bright red. The birds get a meal, while the shrub, vine, or typically small tree gets undigested seeds carried off and deposited with the birds' manure. [[Poison ivy]] is particularly notable for having bright-red foliage drawing birds to its off-white seeds (which are edible for birds, but not most mammals).

===Allelopathy===
The brilliant red autumn color of some species of maple is created by processes separate from those in chlorophyll breakdown. When the tree is struggling to cope with the energy demands of a changing and challenging season, maple trees are involved in an additional metabolic expenditure to create anthocyanins. These anthocyanins, which create the visual red hues, have been found to aid in interspecific competition by stunting the growth of nearby saplings ([[allelopathy]]).&lt;ref&gt;(Frey &amp; Eldridge, 2005){{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Although some autumn coloration occurs wherever deciduous trees are found, the most brightly colored autumn foliage is found in four or five regions of the world: most of southern mainland [[Canada]]; and some areas of the northern [[United States]], [[Scandinavia]], Northern, and Western Europe north of the [[Alps]]; the [[Caucasus]] region near the Black Sea, Russia; and [[Eastern Asia]], including much of northern and eastern [[China]], as well as [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], southern [[Brazil]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[New Zealand]]'s [[South Island]].&lt;ref name="HFLP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hflp.sdstate.edu/pestalrt/alert709.htm|title=Pest Alert|date=August 30, 1998|accessdate=2006-11-28|publisher=South Dakota State University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020194320/http://hflp.sdstate.edu/pestalrt/alert709.htm|archivedate=2006-10-20|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Altman|first=Daniel|date=November 8, 2006|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2006/11/08/2003335441 |title=Fall foliage sets Japan ablaze|publisher=Taipei Times|accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mackie CFX12 Live Sound Mixer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mackie CFX12 Live Sound Mixer]]
An '''aux-send''' (auxiliary send) is an electronic signal-routing output used on  multi-channel sound [[mixing console]]s used in recording and broadcasting settings and on [[PA system]] amplifier-mixers used in music concerts. The signal from the auxiliary send is often routed through outboard audio processing [[effects unit]]s (e.g., reverb, digital delay, compression, etc.) and then returned to the mixer using an auxiliary return input jack, thus creating an [[effects loop]]. This allows effects to be added to an audio source or channel within the mixing console. Another common use of the aux send mix is to create monitor mixes for the onstage performers' [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitor speakers]] or [[in-ear monitors]]. The aux send's monitor mix is usually different from the front of house mix the audience is hearing.

==Purpose==
The routing configuration and usage of an aux-send will vary depending on the application. Two types of aux-sends commonly exist: pre-fader and post-fader. Pre-fader sends are not affected by the main fader for the channel, while post-fader sends ones are affected by the position of the main fader slider control for the channel.

In a common configuration, a post-fader aux-send output is connected to the audio input of an outboard (i.e., an external [usually rack-mounted] unit that is not part of the mixer console) audio [[effects unit]] (most commonly a temporal/time-based effect such as [[reverb]] or [[delay (audio effect)|delay]]; [[Dynamic range compression|compressor]]s and other dynamic processors would normally be on an [[Insert (effects processing)|insert]], instead). The audio output of the outboard unit is then connected to the aux-return input on the mixing console (if the recording console has one), or, alternatively, it can be looped back to one of the console's unused input channels. A post-fader output is used in order to prevent channels whose faders are at zero gain from "contaminating" the effects-return loop with hiss and hum.

Mixing consoles most commonly have a group of aux-send knobs in each channel strip, or, on small mixers, a single aux-send knob per channel, where one knob corresponds to each aux-send on the board. The controls enable the operator to adjust the amount of signal that will be sent from its corresponding channel into the signal bus routed to its corresponding aux-send output. The largest, most expensive mixers have a number of aux-send knobs on every channel, thus giving the audio engineer the flexibility to create many live sound and/or recording applications for the mixer.

[[File:ALTO S-8 mixer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This Alto S-8 mixer has two knobs for controlling the aux-send mix (the third and fourth knobs from the bottom).]]
A benefit of using an aux-send is that it enables the signals from multiple channels on a mixing console to be simultaneously routed to a single outboard device. For instance, audio signals from all the channels of a sixteen-channel mixing console can be routed to a single outboard reverb unit so that all channels are heard with reverb. 

The aux-sends from a group of inputs can also be routed to an amplifier and then sent to [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitor speaker]]s so that the onstage musicians can hear their singing or playing through monitor wedge speakers on the stage or through [[in ear monitor]]s. The benefit of using the pre-fader aux-send function is that the volume of the vocals or instruments in the monitor mix does not have to be the same as the "front-of-house" mix for the audience. Musicians whose voices are barely present in the "front-of-house" mix, such as [[backup vocal]]ists, can have their sound clearly and loudly sent through a monitor speaker so that they can hear themselves singing and ensure that their pitch and timing is correct.

In the early decades of its existence, Chicago suffered numerous widespread outbreaks of [[waterborne diseases]]. The Chicago Board of Health was organized in 1835 in response to the threat of a [[cholera]] epidemic, and later outbreaks of cholera in 1852 and 1854 killed thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/432.html/ |title=Epidemics |publisher=Encyclopedia of Chicago |date=2004 |website= Encyclopedia of Chicago |access-date=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1863, [[Ellis S. Chesbrough]] (1813–1886), the engineer credited with the design of the Chicago sewer system, planned a tunnel five feet wide and lined with brick that would extend through the clay bed of Lake Michigan to a distance of 10,567 feet. Work started in 1864 and the tunnel was opened in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Department of Public Works. Chicago Public Works: A History. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the construction, crews began from the intake location and the shore, tunneling in two shifts a day. Clay and earth were drawn away by mule-drawn railcars. Masons lined the five-foot-diameter tunnel with two layers of brick. The lake and shore crews met in November 1866, less than seven inches out of alignment. A second tunnel was added in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Department of Public Works. Chicago Public Works: A History. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Citation style|date=September 2009}}

'''Chinese law''' is one of the oldest [[legal]] traditions in the world. In the 20th and 21st centuries, law in China inherits a large number of traditions. The core of modern Chinese law is based on Germanic-style [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[socialist law]], and [[Traditional Chinese law|traditional Chinese approaches]].

For most of the [[history of China]], its legal system has been based on the [[Confucianism|Confucian philosophy]] of social control through moral education, as well as the [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalist]] emphasis on [[legal code|codified law]] and [[punishment|criminal sanction]]. Following the [[Revolution of 1911]], the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] adopted a largely Western-style legal code{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} in the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] tradition (specifically [[German law|German-influenced]]). The establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949 brought with it a more [[USSR|Soviet-influenced]] system of [[socialist law#Chinese Socialist law|socialist law]]. However, earlier traditions from Chinese history have retained their influence.

Law in the People's Republic of China is currently undergoing gradual reform, as many elements inside and outside the country emphasize the need to strengthen the [[rule of law]] in China, and international trade and globalization spur transformations in various areas of Chinese domestic law.

== Chinese legal tradition ==
{{Main|Traditional Chinese law}}

The word for law in [[classical Chinese]] was ''fǎ'' (法). The [[Chinese character]] for ''fǎ'' denotes a meaning of "fair", "straight" and "just", derived from its water [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]] (氵).{{citation needed|reason=patent nonsense|date=September 2014}} It also carries the sense of "standard, measurement, and model".&lt;ref&gt;See [[Lang Chippings]], "Explicating 'Law': A Comparative Perspective of Chinese and Western Legal Culture" (1989) 3(1) ''Journal of Chinese Law'' 55-92.&lt;/ref&gt; Derk Bodde and Clarence Morris held that the concept of ''fǎ'' had an association with ''yì'' (義: "social rightness").&lt;ref&gt;Derk Bodde and Clarence Morris, ''Law in Imperial China: Exemplified by 190 Ching Dynasty Cases with Historical, Social, and Judicial Commentaries'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1973) at 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yan Fu]], in his Chinese translation of [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[De l'esprit des lois]]'' published in 1913, warned his readers about the difference between the Chinese ''fǎ'' and Western law: "The word 'law' in Western languages has four different interpretations in Chinese as in ''lǐ'' (理: "order"), ''lǐ'' (禮: "rites", "decorum"), ''fǎ'' (法: "human laws") and ''zhì'' (制: "control").&lt;ref&gt;Yan Fu, ''Fayi'' [法意: "The Spirit of the Laws"] (Beijing: The Commercial Press, 1981) at 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

A term which preceded ''fǎ'' was ''xíng'' (刑), which originally probably referred to [[decapitation]]. ''Xíng'' later evolved to be a general term for laws that related to criminal punishment. The early history ''[[Shang Shu]]'' recorded the earliest forms of the "five penalties": [[tattoo]]ing, [[disfigurement]], [[castration]], [[mutilation]], and [[capital punishment|death]]. Once written law came into existence, the meaning of ''xíng'' was extended to include not only punishments but also any state prohibitions whose violation would result in punishments. In modern times, ''xíng'[[penal law]] or [[criminal law]]. An example of the classical use of ''xíng'' is ''Xíng Bù'' (刑部, lit. "Department of Punishment") for the legal or justice department in imperial China.

The two major Chinese philosophical schools discussed below, Confucianism and Legalism, strongly influenced the idea of law in China. Briefly, under Confucianism, the state should lead the people with virtue and thus create a sense of shame which will prevent bad conduct. Under Legalism, law is to be publicly promulgated standards of conduct backed by state coercion. The tension between these two systems is that Confucianism relies on tradition to make the leader the head of household of all China, while Legalism makes standard law that even the emperor should be bound by. The common factor is that both endorse to different degrees a paternalistic conception of the state, which knows better than its citizens and makes laws to protect them. This concept persisted throughout the imperial period, into the republican period, and can still be seen acting today.

Unlike many other major [[civilization]]s where written law was held in honor and often attributed to divine origin, law in early China was viewed in purely [[secular]] terms, and its initial appearance was greeted with hostility by Confucian thinkers as indicative of a serious moral decline, a violation of human morality, and even a disturbance of the total cosmic order.&lt;ref&gt;Note 4 at 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the people's awareness and acceptance of ethical norms was shaped far more by the pervasive influence of custom and usage of property and by inculcating moral precepts than by any formally enacted system of law. Early emperors however embraced the Legalist ideal as a way of exerting control over their large and growing territory and population. This process was integrated with traditional Chinese beliefs in the cosmic order, holding that correct behavior was behavior consonant with the appropriate responses set by ''fǎ''. ''Xíng'' states the potential costs to the individual of exceeding them and imposes penalties for these actions.&lt;ref&gt;Brian E. McKnight, ''Law and Order in Sung China'' (London: Cambridge University Press, 1992) at 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The imperial period was characterized mainly by the concept of law as serving the state, a means of exerting control over the citizenry. In the late Qing dynasty there were efforts to reform the law codes mainly by importing German codes with slight modifications. This effort continued and was amplified in the republican period resulting in the Provisional Constitution of 1912 which included the idea of equality under the law, rights for women, and broader rights for citizens vis-à-vis the government. The onset of the communist period at first rolled back the development of individual rights with the primary concept of law returning to that of a tool of the state. After the Cultural Revolution devastated the ranks of intellectuals and legal professionals, it took until 1982 for the idea of individual rights to reemerge as a significant influence on Chinese law.

The current constitution, created in 1982, states in Article V that no organization or individual is above the law and in Article III makes the People’s Congresses and state administration responsible to the people, paving the way for later efforts to allow enforcement of individual rights. Passage of the Administrative Litigation Law of 1987 created legal recourse for individuals from arbitrary government action, an avenue previously unavailable. Despite the deep-seated norm against legal proceedings, litigation in the Chinese courts has increased dramatically, especially in recent years. The continuing weakness of courts resulting from their dependence on the local government for financial support and enforcement undermines the effectiveness of these remedies but this has also begun to change with China’s initiatives to increase legal training and the professionalism of the judiciary.

One avenue of individual appeal from government action which continues to be important is the custom of ''xìnfǎng'' or petitions by citizens to the individuals officials for change. The continuing wide use of ''xìnfǎng'' reflects the fact that many officials are still able to avoid legal sanctions and the underlying avoidance of the legal system, as well as the personal ability of officials to personally intervene to change unjust results. Recently ''xìnfǎng'' has been institutionalized to some extent with the central government mandating that every level of administration establish a ''xìnfǎng'' office to handle petitions and report them up to high levels. This solution by exertion of personal power clearly goes against the idea of rule of law, and worse, some scholars have noted that ''xìnfǎng'' today functions more as an informational collection system for the government than an effective review mechanism.

=== Confucianism and Legalism ===
[[Confucianism]] and [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] are two major Classical legal theories or philosophies developed during the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period, a time that saw the most impressive proliferation of new ideas and philosophies in Chinese history. While both theories call for governmental hierarchy, they differ drastically in their views of human potential and the preferred means to achieve political order. Nevertheless, both theories have influenced and continue to influence the development of cultural, social, and legal norms in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|title=The Influence of Confucianism on the Construction of the Chinese Political and Juridical System|date=2008|ssrn=1288392|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Confucianism ====
The basic premise of Confucianism is the idea that human beings are fundamentally good. With this optimistic view on human potential, Confucius advocates for ruling through ''li'' – traditional customs, mores, and norms – which allow people to have a sense of shame and become humane people with good character, rather than through government regulations and penal law. The idea is that people will internalize the acceptable norms and only take proper actions. This will not only lead to a harmonious social order, but it will also provide the additional benefit of improving an individual’s inner character and the overall quality of the society. In contrast, codified laws require external compliance, and people may abide by the laws without fully understanding the reason for compliance. As such, a social order achieved through formal laws does not come with the additional benefit of better citizenry. It is worth noting, however, that even Confucius did not advocate for the elimination of formal laws. Rather, according to Confucius, laws should be used minimally and reserved only for those that insist on pursuing one’s self-interests without taking into account the well being of the society.

As Confucius rejects the general use of formal laws to achieve social order, what lies vital to Confucius’ theory is the willing participation by citizens of the society to search for commonly accepted, cooperative solutions. In addition to willing participation of citizens, there must also be grounds or bases upon which commonly acceptable solutions can be arrived at – the concept known as ''li''. ''Li'' is commonly understood as a set of culturally and socially valued norms that provide guidance to proper behaviors that will ultimately lead to a harmonious society. These norms are not fixed or unchangeable over time but rather a reflection of what is accepted at a particular time in a particular context. When conflicts arise, the ''li'' have to be applied and interpreted to produce a just result and restore the harmony of the society. However, in the absence of any procedural safeguard afforded by codified laws, interpretation of ''li'' is subject to abuse.

Recognizing that people in a society hold diverse interests, Confucius charges the ruler with the responsibility to unify these interests and maintain social order. This is not done by dictatorship but by setting an example. Therefore, a ruler needs not to force his people to behave properly. Instead, the ruler needs only to make himself respectful, and the people will be induced and enlightened by his superior virtues to follow his example – an ideal known as ''wúwéi''. Nevertheless, the ruler must know and understand the ''li'' to be able to create solutions to conflict and problems the society faces. As the people are to follow the moral standards and example set by the ruler, to a large extent, the quality of the ruler determines the quality of the political order.

==== Legalism ====
In contrast to Confucius’ ''li''-based theory, the Legalism advocates the utilization of codified laws and harsh punishment to achieve social order. This is due to the legalists’ belief that all human beings are born evil and self-interested. Therefore, if left unrestrained, people would engage in selfish behavior which will undoubtedly lead to social unrest. To cure this defect and force people to behave morally, the only way, believed the legalists, is to publicly promulgate clearly written laws and impose harsh punishments.

Realizing that the abilities of rulers are often limited and that reliance on the ruler’s ability and judgment often leads to adverse results, the legalists designed a system in which the law is run by the state, not the ruler. This ensures that the laws will be applied impartially without the interference of personal bias of the ruler or ones who are responsible for applying the laws. It also makes it irrelevant whether the ruler has superior abilities. This non-action promoted by the legalists is their understanding of the concept of ''wuwei'', which is different from the Confucians’ understanding of the same concept.

==== Comparison ====
Notwithstanding such an understanding, the ruler, like in Confucianism, has the ultimate authority to decide what the law should be. Therefore, like Confucianism, Legalism is subject to abuse as well. In fact, the Qin emperor implemented strict laws and extremely harsh punishments without taking into account mitigating circumstances even for insignificant crimes. For example, books were burned and people holding different ideals were buried alive. While the Qin emperor successfully instilled fear and respect for law into the minds of his people, the harshness of the law led to his quick demise after only 14 years of reigning over China.

In summary, although both Confucianism and Legalism were developed in a period of turmoil and both were aimed at the re-unification of the country, the two theories went opposite directions with one advocating for and one against the use of formal laws to achieve social order. What the two theories have in common is their concession of the ultimate authority to the ruler, who remained above and beyond the li or law. It is true that neither theory is ideal in achieving a social order. Nevertheless, both theories have had a significant impact on the cultural and legal development in China, and their influence remains visible today.

The significant influence of the Legalist tradition in Chinese law has historically been overlooked. Although the Confucian ideology provided the fundamentals for the substance of traditional law, the Legalist school constructed the important framework of the traditional legal system. The [[Han dynasty]] retained the basic legal system established under the Qin but modified some of the harsher aspects in line with the Confucian philosophy of social control.

The Han dynasty formally recognized four sources of law: ''lü'' (律: "codified laws"), ''ling'' (令: "the emperor's order"), ''ke'' (科: "statutes inherited from previous dynasties") and ''bi'' (比: "precedents"), among which ''ling'' has the highest binding power over the other three. Most legal professionals were not lawyers but generalists trained in philosophy and literature. The local, classically trained, Confucian gentry played a crucial role as arbiters and handled all but the most serious local disputes.

Eventually, the incorporation of the essentials of Confucianist ''li'' into legal codes occurred with this Confucian conception dominating ancient Chinese law. Ch'ü concludes that the gradual process of Confucianisation of law was the most significant development in the legal system of China prior to 20th century modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Ch'ü T'ung-tsu, ''Law and Society in Traditional China'' (Paris: Mouton &amp; Co., 1965) at 280.&lt;/ref&gt; The line between ruling by moral influence and ruling by punishment was not always clearly delineated. For example, ''li'' could be enforced by moral influence and legal means. The metamorphosis of ''li'' into law depended on its widespread and unvaried acceptance by society.

Although the [[Codification (law)|codification]] of law was largely completed by the ''[[Tang Code]]'' of CE 624, throughout the centuries the Confucian foundations of the Tang Code were retained, and indeed with some aspects of it strengthened by the later dynasties. ''The Great Ming Code'', which was a model for the Qing code, covered every part of social and political life, especially family and ritual, but also foreign relations and even relations of earthly life with the cosmos. {{sfnp|Jiang|2005|p=Introduction}}

The Confucian notion that morality and self-discipline was more important than legal codes caused many historians, such as [[Max Weber]], until the mid-20th century to conclude that law was not an important part of Imperial Chinese society. This notion, however, has come under extreme criticism and is no longer the conventional wisdom among Sinologists, who have concluded that Imperial China had an elaborate system of both criminal and civil law which was comparable to anything found in Europe.

During the Qing dynasty, criminal justice was based on extremely detailed ''[[Great Qing Legal Code]]''. One element of the traditional Chinese criminal justice system is the notion that criminal law has a moral purpose, one of which is to get the convicted to repent and see the error of his ways. In the traditional Chinese legal system, a person could not be convicted of a crime unless he has confessed. This often led to the use of [[torture]], in order to extract the necessary confession. These elements still influence modern Chinese views toward law. All [[capital punishment|capital offenses]] were reported to the capital and required the personal approval of the [[List of Emperors of the Qing Dynasty|emperor]].

There was no [[civil code]] separate from the [[criminal code]], which led to the now discredited belief that traditional Chinese law had no civil law. More recent studies have demonstrated that most of the magistrates' legal work was in civil disputes, and that there was an elaborate system of [[Private law|civil law]] which used the criminal code to establish [[torts]].

== Modernization ==
The introduction and translation of Western legal texts into Chinese is believed to have been started under the auspices of [[Lin Zexu]] in 1839. More systematic introduction of Western law together with other Western sciences started with the establishment of [[Tongwen Guan]] in 1862. The major efforts in translation of Western law that continued until the 1920s prepared the building blocks for modern Chinese legal language and Chinese law.&lt;ref&gt;Yu Jiang, "Jindai Zhongguo faxue yuci de xingcheng yu fazhan" [近代中国法学语词的形成与发展: "Formation and development of modern Chinese legal language and terms"] in ''Zhongxi falü chuantong'' [中西法律传统: "Chinese and Western Legal Tradition"], vol. 1 (Beijing: Zhongguo zhengfa daxue chubanshe, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Legal translation was very important from 1896 to 1936 during which period the Chinese absorbed and codified their version of Western laws. These efforts were assisted by the medium of the Japanese legal language and law developed in Japan during the [[Meiji period]] which involved in large part Japanese translation of [[civil law (legal system)|European Continental laws]].

In the late [[Qing dynasty]] there was a concerted effort to establish legal codes based on European models. Because of the German victory in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and because Japan was used as the model for political and legal reform, the law codes which were adopted were modeled closely after that of Germany.

Attitudes toward the traditional Chinese legal system changed markedly in the late-20th century. Most Chinese and Westerners of the early 20th century regarded the traditional Chinese legal system as backward and barbaric. However, extensive research into China's traditional legal system has caused attitudes to become more favorable in the late-20th and early 21st centuries. Researchers of the early and mid-20th century tended to compare the traditional Chinese legal system to then contemporary systems, finding the former to be backward. However, more recent research compared the 18th-century Chinese legal system to European systems of the 18th century, resulting in a far more positive view of traditional Chinese law. {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The Department of Punishment was changed to ''fa bu'' (法部: "Department of Law") in the early 1900s legal reforms.

=== Republic of China ===
{{Main|Law of the Republic of China}}
Law in the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]) is mainly a civil law system. The legal structure is codified into the [[Six Codes]]: the Constitution, the Civil Code, the Code of Civil Procedures, the Criminal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedures and in Administrative Laws.

=== People's Republic of China ===
{{Main|Law of the People's Republic of China}}

After the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Communist victory]] in 1949, the newly established People's Republic of China (PRC) quickly abolished the ROC's legal codes and attempted to create a system of [[socialist law]] copied from the [[Soviet law|Soviet Union]]. With the [[Sino-Soviet split]] (1960-1989) and the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966-1976), all legal work came under suspicion of being counter-revolutionary, and the legal system completely collapsed.

Over the past century [[Constitution of China (disambiguation)|China has had several constitutions]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Hung-Yee Chen (1992), pp. 42-45.&lt;/ref&gt; The first attempts towards implementing a constitution in China occurred during the final decade (1902-1912) of the [[Qing Dynasty]]. Various controlling groups subsequently promulgated different constitutions between that time and the establishment of the PRC in 1949. The PRC had a provisional constitution from its inception until the enactment of its first constitution in 1954. This initial constitution was based on the constitution of the Soviet Union. It was shortly ignored, however, and became without legal force. Although it provided for the election of the [[National People’s Congress]] (NPC) every four years as the highest state power, these guidelines were not adhered to. The second constitution of the PRC, modeled on the ideology of the Cultural Revolution, came into force in 1975. This constitution subjected the NPC to the [[Communist Party of China]] and removed previous constitutional protections such as equality under the law and private-property succession rights. It was also immediately disregarded through breaches of its provisions and non-adherence to guidelines regarding the NPC. The third constitution of the PRC was adopted in 1978. Although this version moved away from the ideologies of the Cultural Revolution, it did retain some remnants of it. It also retained Communist Party control over the state structure. However, reformists subsequently gained power, which led to the breakdown of this constitution as focus shifted to economic construction and modernization.

With the start of the [[Deng Xiaoping]] reforms (ca 1979), the need for reconstructing a legal system to restrain abuses of official authority and revolutionary excesses was seen.{{by whom|date=May 2016}} In 1982 the National People's Congress adopted a new [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|state constitution]] that emphasized the rule of law under which even party leaders are theoretically held accountable. Legal reconstruction occurred in piece-meal fashion. Typically, temporary or local regulations would be established; after a few years of experimentation, conflicting regulations and laws would be standardized.

The {{as of | 2016 | alt = current}} Constitution of the PRC, enacted in 1982, reflects the model of the first PRC constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Hung-Yee Chen (1992), pp. 45-54.&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution provides for [[leadership]] through the working class, led in turn by the Communist Party. This Constitution also contains more extensive rights than any of the previous constitutions. The rights include equality before the law, political rights, religious freedom, personal freedom, social and economic rights, cultural and educational rights, and familial rights. These rights, however, are connected to social duties. The duties include safeguarding the unity, security, honor, and interests of the country, observing law and social ethics, paying taxes, and serving in the military. Neither the rights nor duties provided for in the Constitution are exhaustive.

The Constitution provides that the NPC is the supreme organ of state power over a structure of other people's congresses at various levels.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Hung-Yee Chen (1992), pp. 48-55.&lt;/ref&gt; The NPC has power to:

* amend the Constitution by a two-thirds majority
* promulgate legislation
* elect and remove highest-level officials
* determine the budget
* control economic and social-development planning

The NPC also includes a [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Standing Committee]] that functions much as the NPC does when the NPC is not in session. Although the Standing Committee has had some powers since 1955, its law-making powers were initially provided for in the 1982 Constitution. The NPC sits at the highest level in the hierarchy of governmental structure in the PRC. This national level is followed in descending order by the provincial level (including autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the national level), the [[Prefectures of the People's Republic of China|prefectural]] level, the [[Counties of the People's Republic of China|county]] level, and the townships and towns level. Government members at the lower two levels are directly elected, and those at the higher levels are elected by the lower levels. In addition to the NPC, the provincial people's congresses possesses legislative power and can pass laws so long as they do not contravene the Constitution or higher legislation or administrative regulations.

The Constitution states its own supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Hung-Yee Chen (1992), pp. 40-46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been theorized{{by whom|date=May 2016}} that the supremacy of the Communist Party means that the Constitution and law are not supreme, and that this perspective results from the [[Marxism|Marxist]] view of law as simply a [[Base and superstructure|superstructure]] combined with a lack of recognition of rule of law in philosophical or historical tradition. Although the Constitution provides for legislative, executive, judicial, and [[Supreme People's Procuratorate|procuratorial]] powers, they all remain subject to Communist Party leadership. Often, important political decisions are made through actions which are not regulated by the Constitution. Additionally, [[Court system of the People's Republic of China|court]]s need not rely on the Constitution in deciding cases, and they may not review legislation for Constitutionality.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Nonetheless the Constitution does provide the linguistic framework for conducting government affairs and describing them in the media.

Since 1979, when the drive to establish a functioning legal system began, more than 300 laws and regulations, most of them in the economic area, have been promulgated. The use of [[Law enforcement in China|mediation committee]]s, informed groups of citizens who resolve about 90% of the PRC's civil disputes and some minor criminal cases at no cost to the parties, is one innovative device. More than 800,000 such committees operate - in both [[rural]] and urban areas.

In drafting the new laws, the PRC has not copied any other legal system wholesale, and the general pattern has involved issuing laws for a specific topic or location. Often laws are drafted on a trial basis, with the law being redrafted after several years. This process of creating a legal infrastructure piecemeal has led to many situations where the laws are missing, confusing, or contradictory, and has led to judicial decisions having more [[legal precedent|precedent]]al value than in most [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. In formulating laws, the PRC has been influenced by a number of sources, including traditional Chinese views toward the role of law, the PRC's socialist background, the German-based law of the [[Republic of China]] on [[Taiwan]], and the [[England and Wales|English]]-based [[common law]] used in Hong Kong.

Legal reform became a government priority in the 1990s. The Chinese government has promoted a reform it often calls "[[legalisation]]" (法制化). Legalisation, among other things, has provided the régime with a gloss of legitimacy and has enhanced predictability.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} There have been major efforts in the rationalization and strengthening of the legal structure and institution building in terms of developing and improving the professionalism of the legislature, judiciary and legal profession. As [[Chinese economic reform|market reform]]s have deepened and social inequality has widened, legal forums – ranging from [[mediation]] and [[arbitration]] commissions to courts – have come to play an increasingly prominent role.

The 1994 Administrative Procedural Law allows citizens to sue officials for abuse of authority or [[malfeasance]]. In addition, the [[criminal law]] and the criminal-procedures laws were amended to introduce significant reforms. The criminal-law amendments abolished the crime of "[[counter-revolutionary]]" activity. However [[political dissident]]s are sometimes charged on the grounds of subverting state security or of publishing state secrets. Criminal-procedures reforms also encouraged establishment of a more transparent, adversarial trial process. Minor crimes such as prostitution and drug use are sometimes dealt with under [[re-education through labor]] laws. The PRC constitution and laws provide for [[fundamental human rights]], including [[due process]], but some have argued that they are often ignored in practice. (See [[Human rights in the People's Republic of China]].)

The basic principles of Chinese legislative drafting include generality and flexibility. Sometimes excessive generality and omissions in Chinese law, coupled with the wide discretionary powers conferred on local authorities to implement laws, undermines the predictability and certainty of law. Furthermore, as Chinese law is intended{{by whom|date=May 2016}} to be educative, the language of the law is that of the ordinary language comprehensible to the average [[citizen]],{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} although many laws are drafted in broad and indeterminate language.

As a result of a pending trade war with the [[United States|United States of America]] over violations of [[intellectual property]] rights of American corporations in the early 1990s,{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} the [[People's Republic of China's trademark law]] has been modified and {{as of | 1995 | lc = on}} offers significant protections to foreign trademark-owners.&lt;ref name="Alford"&gt;{{cite book | last= Alford | first= William P. | title= To Steal a Book is an Elegant Offense: Intellectual Property Law in Chinese Civilization | publisher= [[Stanford University Press]] | year= 1995 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NahUmDXLYLwC&amp;printsec=frontcover | isbn = 0-8047-2270-6 | location = Stanford, California | authorlink = William P. Alford}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2016}}

After their respective transfers of sovereignty, Hong Kong and [[Macau]] continue to practice English [[Common Law]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] legal systems respectively, with their own [[Court of Final Appeal (disambiguation)|courts of final appeal]]. In other words, Hong Kong and Macau lie outside of the legal jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China, except on constitutional issues.

Due to the growing sophistication of Chinese laws, the expansion of the [[rule of law]], as well as an influx of foreign [[law firm]]s, China has also begun to develop a [[legal services|legal-services]] market. Foreign lawyers have accompanied foreign capital and their clients to China, which has had an immense influence on the promulgation of new Chinese laws based on international norms, especially in regards to intellectual property and [[Corporate law|corporate]] and [[Securities law|securities]] law.&lt;ref name="Alford" /&gt;{{qn|date=May 2016}}

On July 1, 1992, in order to meet growing demand, the Chinese government opened the legal-services market to foreign law-firms, allowing them to establish offices in China when the [[Ministry of Justice]] and the [[State Administration of Industry and Commerce]] (SAOIC) issued the Provisional Regulation of Establishment of Offices by Foreign Law Firms regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130415140013/http://www.oycf.org/Perspectives2/6_063000/internationalization_of_china.htm The Internationalization of China's Legal Services Market&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, many foreign law firms, including the United States' [[Baker &amp; McKenzie]] and [[Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison]], along with several British firms, incorporated consulting firms in their home countries or in Hong Kong and then set up subsidiaries in Beijing or Shanghai to provide legal services.

However, many regulatory barriers to entry remain to protect the domestic legal industry. Issues relating to Chinese law must be referred to Chinese law firms, and foreign lawyers are also prohibited from interpreting or practicing Chinese law or from representing their clients in court. However, in reality many foreign law firms interpret laws and manage litigation by directing the local firms they must have cooperative relationships with. In this regard, China's restrictive legal market can be directly tied{{by whom|date=May 2016}} to a phobia of people asserting their legal rights in the face of rampant corruption. Information received{{by whom|date=May 2016}} from the State Council Legislative Office suggests that China may be allowing foreigners to sit the Chinese Lawyers Examination, or have a mutual recognition treaty with other countries to allow foreign lawyers to conduct non-litigation Chinese legal work.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

While China's legal market continues to open up, China's laws and regulations have helped the development of a number of domestic Chinese firms specializing in working with foreigners to meet the demand of a booming economy. According to ''[[Asia Law and Business]]'' magazine China Awards, the top China firms were{{when|date=May 2016}} [[King &amp; Wood PRC Lawyers]], [[Commerce &amp; Finance Law Offices]], [[Fangda Partners]], [[Haiwen &amp; Partners]], [[Jun He Law Offices]] and [[Lehman, Lee &amp; Xu]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Legal rights ==
Classical Chinese does not have a semantic equivalent to the concept of "rights".{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The idea of rights was introduced to China from the West. Its translation as ''quánlì'' (权利) was coined by [[William Alexander Parsons Martin]] in 1864, in his translation of [[Henry Wheaton]]'s ''Elements of International Law''....

== Rule of law ==
One of the most commonly used phrases in contemporary China, by legal scholars and politicians alike, is fǎzhì (法治). Fǎzhì can be translated into English as “[[rule of law]]”, but questions have often been asked whether Chinese leaders meant "rule by law", which means the instrumental use of laws by rulers to facilitate social control and to impose punishment as understood in the Legalist tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Chelan Li, The “Rule of Law” Policy in Guangdong: Continuity or Departure? Meaning, Significance and Processes. (2000), 199-220.
 Reply Forward&lt;/ref&gt; The related concepts of yǐ fǎzhì guó (以法治国: "governing the nation with law") and jiànshè shèhuì zhǔyì fǎzhì guójiā (建设社会主义法制国家: "building a socialist rule of law state") have been part of the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s official policy since the mid-1990s. In 1999, the NPC adopted an amendment to the Chinese Constitution, incorporating both concepts in Article 5.

The existence of the rule of law in China has been widely debated.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Peerenboom &amp; He Xin, ''Dispute Resolution in China: Patterns, Causes, and Prognosis'', 4 [[East Asia Law Review]] (2009), found at [http://www.pennealr.com/pages/issues/volume_4/issue_1.php Penne. ALR website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325094835/http://www.pennealr.com/pages/issues/volume_4/issue_1.php |date=2011-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When discussing Chinese law, it is worth noting that various expressions have been used, including “strengthening the law,” “tightening up the legal system,” “abiding by the law in administration,” “rule by law,” and the “rule of law”. Different shades of meanings have been attached to each of these terms, but Chinese officials and scholars have employed the expressions rather loosely and sometimes interchangeably.&lt;ref name="The 2000"&gt;Linda Chelan Li, The “Rule of Law” Policy in Guangdong: Continuity or Departure? Meaning, Significance and Processes. (2000), 199-220.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the central government had originally preferred the expression, “strengthening the law/legal system” to “the rule of law”. It was thought that the latter might give a controversial connotation of the instrumentality, while the former conveyed a straightforward meaning of strengthening the law and institutions. “Strengthening the law” meant reform of legislation and [[Law enforcement in the People's Republic of China|enforcement of laws]].&lt;ref name="The 2000" /&gt;
There are differing theories of the rule of law. One theory is the "thin", or formal, theory of rule of law, and the other is the "thick" theory.

The "thin" theory of rule of law is described by Randall Peerenboom as at the basest level incorporating a legal system that imposes meaningful restraints on the state and individuals in ruling power, that the law is supreme, and that all citizens are equal before the law (Peerenboom, 2). According to Lon Fuller’s account of thin theory, rule of law exists in a society when the laws of that society are “general, public, prospective, clear, consistent, capable of being followed, stable, and enforced” (Peerenboom, 3). The thin theory has also been explained by Joseph Raz as emphasizing the formal or instrumental aspects of a legal system regardless of whether it is part of a particular political structure, i.e. a democratic or non-democratic society.[14] Thick theory rule of law espouses all the elements of thin theory in addition imposes a political, social, and economic concept into the rule of law. The [[rule of law]] is regarded by some as presupposing political or economic structures of [[liberal democracy]], [[human rights]] and other ideal socio-legal order.[11] Some scholars believe that given China's socialist and non-democratic political system and practice, it is at best regarded as a country of rule by law with law used by the state as an instrument for social control.[12] However, others rely on the formal or thin theory of rule of law to interpret fazhi as a legal reality in China.[13] Additionally, some believe that China may still fall short of the thin theory of rule of law.

Of particular relevance to the second principle set out above, was the enactment of the Administrative Permission Law of the PRC (APL) on 27 August 2003, effective from July 2004. The APL for the first time requires all laws and regulations that subject any civil act to approval requirements to be published.&lt;ref name="China Briefing Business Guide: North East China"&gt;{{cite web|title=China Briefing Business Reports|url=http://www.china-briefing.com/download.php?download_file=ChinaBriefing_200506.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090225181134/http://www.china-briefing.com/user/login?goto=download.php?download_file=ChinaBriefing_200506.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-02-25|publisher=Asia Briefing|year=2008|accessdate=2009-02-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The APL also provides that only those laws adopted by the National People’s Congress or its Standing Committee, administrative regulations promulgated by the State Council, and local regulations adopted by the local people’s congresses may impose administrative approval requirements. Individual ministries or agencies (central or local) do not have such powers except in specified circumstances. This is consistent with the hierarchy of laws and regulations provided under the Legislative Law of the PRC. The enactment of the APL represents an encouraging step forward.&lt;ref name="China Briefing Business Guide: North East China" /&gt;

Despite the newly elevated role of courts in Chinese society, there still remains some consensus about defects in China’s legal system in regards to progressing towards the rule of law. Scholars point to the following defects as slowing movement toward rule of law. These include:
* First, the [[National People’s Congress]] is ineffective at executing its constitutional duty to legislate and supervise the government.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Hung-yee Chen, An Introduction to the Legal Systems of the People’s Republic of China, Butterworths Asia (1992), 80-82.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Second, the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Constitution]] is not treated as the supreme law, nor is it enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, 107; Randal Peerenboom, China’s Long March Toward Rule of Law, Cambridge University Press (2002), 61&lt;/ref&gt;
* Third, the judiciary is not independent from political pressure. On the other hand, direct intervention in particular cases by the CCP has lessened in recent years, as has the direct influence of the CCP on the legislative process.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, 106, 117-121&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fourth, there is a high level of corruption among public officials. Personal favors, bribery, and taking of public monies are all too common at all levels of government.&lt;ref&gt;Peerenboom, 295-297&lt;/ref&gt;
* Finally, the legal profession is inadequate for lack of qualified attorneys and judges.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, 121-123&lt;/ref&gt; This failure is being remedied by legislation aimed at instituting higher educational standards for judges, opening more courts and law schools throughout China.&lt;ref&gt;Peerenboom, 290-293&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, the [[Weiquan movement]] began in the PRC, seeking to advance citizens' rights partly by petitioning for enforcement of existing laws, and partly through activism. Lawyers in the movement have seen some court victories, but in other cases they are unsuccessful.

'''Conservation genetics''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] subfield of [[Population genetics|Population Genetics]] that aims to understand the dynamics of genes in populations principally to avoid extinction. Therefore, it applies [[genetics|genetic]] methods to the conservation and restoration of [[biodiversity]].  Researchers involved in conservation genetics come from a variety of fields including [[population genetics]], [[molecular ecology]], [[molecular biology|biology]], [[evolutionary biology]], and [[systematics]]. [[Genetic diversity]] is one of the three fundamental levels of biodiversity, so it is directly important in conservation. Genetic variability influences both the health and long-term survival of populations because decreased genetic diversity has been associated with reduced [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], such as high juvenile mortality, diminished population growth,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leberg|first=P.

==Genetic diversity==
[[Genetic diversity]] is the variability of genes in a species. A number of means can express the level of genetic diversity: observed [[Zygosity#heterozygosity|heterozygosity]], expected heterozygosity, the mean number of [[alleles]] per [[Locus (genetics)|locus]], or the percentage of [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] loci.

==Importance of genetic diversity==
[[Genetic diversity]] determines the potential fitness of a population and ultimately its long-term persistence, because genes encode phenotypic information. Extinction risk has been associated with low genetic diversity because several researchers have documented reduced fitness in populations with low genetic diversity. For example, low genetic diversity as low heterozigosity has been associated with low juvenile survival, reduced population growth, low body size, diminished adult lifespan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanski|first=Ilkka|last2=Saccheri|first2=Ilik|date=2006-04-25|title=Molecular-Level Variation Affects Population Growth in a Butterfly Metapopulation|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040129|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=4|issue=5|pages=e129|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040129|issn=1545-7885|pmc=1440940|pmid=16620151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lande|first=R.|date=1988-09-16|title=Genetics and demography in biological conservation|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/241/4872/1455|journal=Science|language=en|volume=241|issue=4872|pages=1455–1460|doi=10.1126/science.3420403|issn=0036-8075|pmid=3420403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drayton|first=J.

The importance of genetic diversity has many reasons. For example, one can consider the probability of within any given population that at least one individual or a potential reproductive pair have the genetic composition encoding a phenotype capable of survival an environment event. If l the individuals are nearly identical, if new pressures (such as environmental disasters) occur, a population with high genetic diversity has a greater chance of having at least some individuals with a genetic makeup that allows them to survive, or if genetic diversity is very low, none of the individuals in a population may have the characteristics needed to cope with the new environmental conditions. Such a population could be suddenly wiped out.

The genetic diversity of a species is always open to change. No matter how many variants of a gene are present in a population today, only the variants that survive in the next generation can contribute to species diversity in the future. Once gene variants are lost, they cannot be recovered.

==Techniques==
Specific genetic techniques are used to assess the genomes of a species regarding specific conservation issues as well as general population structure.&lt;ref name=Haig&gt;Haig&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis can be done in two ways, with current DNA of individuals or historic DNA.&lt;ref name=Wayne&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wayne, Robert|author2=Morin, Phillip|title=Conservation genetics in the new molecular age|journal=Front Ecol Evol|volume=2|issue=2|year=2004|pages=89–97|publisher=The Ecological Society of America|doi=10.1890/1540-9295(2004)002[0089:CGITNM]2.0.CO;2|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229422875_Conservation_Genetics_in_the_New_Molecular_Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Techniques for analysing the differences between individuals and populations include

#[[Alloenzymes]]
#[[Restriction fragment length polymorphism|Random fragment length polymorphisms]]
#[[Amplified fragment length polymorphism]]s
#[[RAPD|Random amplification of polymorphic DNA]]
#[[Single strand conformation polymorphism]]
#[[Minisatellite]]s
#[[Microsatellite (genetics)|Microsatellite]]s
#[[Single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s
#Dna [[DNA sequencing|Sequence]]

These different techniques focus on different variable areas of the genomes within animals and plants. The specific information that is required determines which techniques are used and which parts of the genome are analysed. For example, [[mitochondrial DNA]] in animals has a high substitution rate, which makes it useful for identifying differences between individuals. However, it is only inherited in the female line, and the mitochondrial genome is relatively small. In plants, the mitochondrial DNA has very high rates of structural mutations, so is rarely used for genetic markers, as the [[chloroplast genome]] can be used instead. Other sites in the genome that are subject to high mutation rates such as the [[major histocompatibility complex]], and the [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellites]] and [[minisatellite]]s are also frequently used.

These techniques can provide information on long-term conservation of genetic diversity and expound demographic and ecological matters such as taxonomy.&lt;ref name=Haig/&gt;

Another technique is using historic DNA for genetic analysis.  Historic DNA is important because it allows geneticists to understand how species reacted to changes to conditions in the past.  This is a key to understanding the reactions of similar species in the future.&lt;ref name=Wayne/&gt;

Techniques using historic DNA include looking at preserved remains found in museums and caves.&lt;ref name="Robert, pp. 89–97"&gt;Robert, pp. 89–97&lt;/ref&gt; Museums are used because there is a wide range of species that are available to scientists all over the world.  The problem with museums is that, historical perspectives are important because understanding how species reacted to changes in conditions in the past is a key to understanding reactions of similar species in the future.&lt;ref name="Robert, pp. 89–97"/&gt;  Evidence found in caves provides a longer perspective and does not disturb the animals.&lt;ref name="Robert, pp. 89–97"/&gt;

Another technique that relies on specific genetics of an individual is noninvasive monitoring, which uses extracted DNA from organic material that an individual leaves behind, such as a feather.&lt;ref name="Robert, pp. 89–97"/&gt; This too avoids disrupting the animals and can provide information about the sex, movement, kinship and diet of an individual.&lt;ref name="Robert, pp. 89–97"/&gt;

Other more general techniques can be used to correct genetic factors that lead to extinction and risk of extinction.  For example, when minimizing inbreeding and increasing genetic variation multiple steps can be taken. Increasing [[heterozygosity]] through immigration, increasing the generational interval through [[cryopreservation]] or breeding from older animals, and increasing the [[effective population size]] through equalization of family size all helps minimize inbreeding and its effects.&lt;ref name="Franklin 1995"&gt;{{harv|Frankham|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deleterious alleles arise through mutation, however certain recessive ones can become more prevalent due to inbreeding.&lt;ref name="Franklin 1995"/&gt; Deleterious mutations that arise from inbreeding can be removed by [[genetic purging|purging]], or natural selection.&lt;ref name="Franklin 1995"/&gt;  Populations raised in captivity with the intent of being reintroduced in the wild suffer from adaptations to captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Woodworth, Lynn; Montgomery, Margaret; Briscoe, David; Frankham, Richard|title=Rapid genetic deterioration in captive populations: causes and conservation implications|journal=Conservation Genetics|volume=3|issue=3|year=2002|pages=277–88|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|doi=10.1023/A:1019954801089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inbreeding depression, loss of genetic diversity, and genetic adaptation to captivity are disadvantageous in the wild, and many of these issues can be dealt with through the aforementioned techniques aimed at increasing heterozygosity.  In addition  creating a captive environment that closely resembles the wild and fragmenting the populations so there is less response to selection also help reduce adaptation to captivity.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery&lt;/ref&gt;

Solutions to minimize the factors that lead to extinction and risk of extinction often overlap because the factors themselves overlap. For example, deleterious mutations are added to populations through mutation, however the deleterious mutations conservation biologists are concerned with are ones that are brought about by inbreeding, because those are the ones that can be taken care of by reducing inbreeding. Here the techniques to reduce inbreeding also help decrease the accumulation of deleterious mutations.

==Applications==
These techniques have wide ranging applications. One application of these specific molecular techniques is in defining species and sub-species of salmonids.&lt;ref name=Haig/&gt; [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybridization]] is an especially important issue in salmonids and this has wide ranging conservation, political, social and economic implications. In Cutthroat Trout mtDNA and alloenzyme analysis, hybridization between native and non-native species was shown to be one of the major factors contributing to the decline in their populations. This led to efforts to remove some hybridized populations so native populations could breed more readily.  Cases like these impact everything from the economy of local fishermen to larger companies, such as timber. Specific molecular techniques led to a closer analysis of taxonomic relationships, which is one factor that can lead to extinctions if unclear.

==Implications==
New technology in conservation genetics has many implications for the future of conservation biology. At the molecular level, new technologies are advancing. Some of these techniques include the analysis of [[minisatellite]]s and [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC]].&lt;ref name=Haig/&gt; These molecular techniques have wider effects from clarifying taxonomic relationships, as in the previous example, to determining the best individuals to reintroduce to a population for recovery by determining kinship. These effects then have consequences that reach even further. Conservation of species has implications for humans in the economic, social, and political realms.&lt;ref name=Haig/&gt; In the biological realm increased genotypic diversity has been shown to help ecosystem recovery, as seen in a community of grasses which was able to resist disturbance to grazing geese through greater genotypic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frankham, Richard|title=Ecosystem recovery enhanced by genotypic diversity|journal=Heredity|volume=95|page=183|year=2005|url=http://izt.ciens.ucv.ve/ecologia/Archivos/ECO_POB_2005/ECOPO7_2005/Frankham%202005.pdf|doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800706}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because species diversity increases ecosystem function, increasing biodiversity through new conservation genetic techniques has wider reaching effects than before.

A short list of studies a conservation geneticist may research include:

# [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] classification of species, subspecies, geographic races, and populations, and measures of [[phylogenetic diversity]] and uniqueness.
# Identifying [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] species, hybridization in natural populations, and assessing the history and extent of introgression between species.
# Population genetic structure of natural and managed populations, including identification of [[Evolutionary Significant Unit]]s (ESUs) and management units for conservation.
# Assessing genetic variation within a species or population, including small or [[endangered]] populations, and estimates such as effective population size (Ne).
# Measuring the impact of [[inbreeding depression|inbreeding]] and [[outbreeding depression]], and the relationship between heterozygosity and measures of fitness (see [[Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection]]).
# Evidence of disrupted mate choice and [[Reproductive strategy#Reproductive strategies|reproductive strategy]] in disturbed populations.
# [[Forensic]] applications, especially for the control of trade in endangered species.
# Practical methods for monitoring and maximizing genetic diversity during captive breeding programs and re-introduction schemes, including mathematical models and case studies.
# Conservation issues related to the introduction of [[genetically modified organisms]].
# The interaction between environmental contaminants and the biology and health of an organism, including changes in mutation rates and [[adaptation]] to local changes in the environment (e.g. [[industrial melanism]]). 
#New techniques for [[noninvasive genotyping]].

{{Cosmology}}
The '''deceleration parameter ''&lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;''''' in cosmology is a [[dimensionless]] measure of the '''cosmic acceleration''' of the [[expansion of space]] in a [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker universe]].  It is defined by:
:&lt;math&gt;q \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  -\frac{\ddot{a} a }{\dot{a}^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor of the universe]] and the dots indicate derivatives by [[proper time]]. The expansion of the universe is said to be "accelerating" if &lt;math&gt;\ddot{a} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; (recent measurements suggest it is), and in this case the deceleration parameter will be negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Mark H. |last2=Lambourne  |first2=Robert J. |title=An Introduction to Galaxies and Cosmology |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=2004 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=36K1PfetZegC&amp;pg=PA244 244] |isbn=978-0-521-83738-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minus sign and name "deceleration parameter" are historical; at the time of definition &lt;math&gt;\ddot{a}&lt;/math&gt; was expected to be negative, so a minus sign was inserted in the definition to make &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; positive in that case. Since the evidence for the [[accelerating universe]] in the 1998–2003 era, it is now believed that &lt;math&gt;\ddot{a}&lt;/math&gt; is positive therefore the present-day value &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt; is negative (though &lt;math&gt; q &lt;/math&gt; was positive in the past before dark energy became dominant). In general &lt;math&gt; q &lt;/math&gt; varies with cosmic time, except in a few special cosmological models; the present-day value is denoted &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt;. 

The  [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann acceleration equation]] can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;3\frac{\ddot{a}}{a} =-4 \pi G \sum_i (\rho_i +\frac{3\,p_i}{c^2})= -4\pi G \sum_i \rho_i (1 + 3 w_i), &lt;/math&gt;

where the sum &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; extends over the different components, matter, radiation and dark energy, &lt;math&gt;\rho_i&lt;/math&gt; is the equivalent mass density of each component, &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; is its pressure, and &lt;math&gt;w_i = p_i/(\rho_i c^2) &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] for each component. The value of &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; is 0 for non-relativistic matter (baryons and dark matter), 1/3 for radiation, and -1 for a [[cosmological constant]]; for more general [[dark energy]] it may differ from -1, in which case it is denoted &lt;math&gt;w_{DE}&lt;/math&gt; or simply
&lt;math&gt; w &lt;/math&gt;.   

Defining the critical density as 

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_{c} = \frac{3 H^2}{8 \pi G} &lt;/math&gt; 
and the density parameters &lt;math&gt; \Omega_i = \rho_i / \rho_c &lt;/math&gt;, dividing the above gives 

:&lt;math&gt;q= \frac{1}{2} \sum \Omega_i (1+3w_i) = \Omega_{rad}(z) +\frac{1}{2}\Omega_m(z) + \frac{1+3w_{DE} }{2} \Omega_{DE}(z) \ . &lt;/math&gt; 

where the density parameters are at the relevant cosmic epoch.  
At the present day &lt;math&gt; \Omega_{rad} \sim 10^{-4} &lt;/math&gt; is negligible, and if &lt;math&gt; w_{DE} = -1 &lt;/math&gt; (cosmological constant) this simplifies to 
:&lt;math&gt; q_0 = \frac{1}{2} \Omega_m - \Omega_\Lambda . &lt;/math&gt; 
where the density parameters are present-day values; this evaluates to &lt;math&gt; q_0 \approx -0.55 &lt;/math&gt; for the parameters estimated
from the [[Planck spacecraft]] data. (Note that the CMB, as a high-redshift measurement, does not directly measure &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt;; but its value can be inferred by fitting cosmological models to the CMB data, then calculating &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt; from the other measured parameters as above).   

The time derivative of the [[Hubble parameter]] can be written in terms of the deceleration parameter:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\dot{H}}{H^2}=-(1+q).&lt;/math&gt;

Except in the speculative case of [[phantom energy]] (which violates all the energy conditions), all postulated forms of mass-energy yield a deceleration parameter &lt;math&gt;q \geqslant -1.&lt;/math&gt; Thus, any non-phantom universe should have a decreasing Hubble parameter, except in the case of the distant future of a [[Lambda-CDM model]], where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; will tend to -1 from above and the Hubble parameter will asymptote to a constant value of
&lt;math&gt; H_0 \sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda} &lt;/math&gt;. 

The above results imply that the universe would be decelerating for any cosmic fluid with equation of state &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; greater than &lt;math&gt;-\tfrac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; (any fluid satisfying the [[strong energy condition]] does so, as does any form of matter present in the [[Standard Model]], but excluding inflation). However observations of distant [[type Ia supernova]]e indicate that &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is negative; the expansion of the universe is accelerating.  This is an indication that the gravitational attraction of matter, on the cosmological scale, is more than counteracted by the negative pressure of [[dark energy]], in the form of either [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] or a positive [[cosmological constant]].

Before the first indications of an accelerating universe, in 1998, it was thought that the universe was dominated by matter with negligible pressure, &lt;math&gt;w \approx 0.&lt;/math&gt; This implied that the deceleration parameter would be equal to &lt;math&gt; \Omega_m/2 &lt;/math&gt;, e.g. &lt;math&gt; q_0 = 1/2 &lt;/math&gt; for a universe with &lt;math&gt; \Omega_m = 1 &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; q_0 \sim 0.1 &lt;/math&gt; for a low-density zero-Lambda model. The experimental effort to discriminate these cases with supernovae actually revealed negative &lt;math&gt; q_0 \sim -0.6 \pm 0.2 &lt;/math&gt;, evidence for cosmic acceleration, which has subsequently grown stronger.

'''Don Hopkins''' is an [[artist]] and [[programmer]] specializing in [[human computer interaction]] and [[computer graphics]] and an alumnus of the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]&lt;ref name="resume"&gt;[http://www.donhopkins.com/home/resume.html Resume for Donald Edward Hopkins]&lt;/ref&gt; and a former member of the [[University of Maryland Human–Computer Interaction Lab]].

He inspired [[Richard Stallman]], who described him as a "very imaginative fellow", to use the term [[copyleft]]. He coined [[Deep Crack]] as the name of the [[EFF DES cracker]].&lt;ref name="resume" /&gt; He ported the ''[[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]]'' computer game to several versions of [[Unix]] and developed a multi player version of ''SimCity'' for X11, did much of the core programming of ''[[The Sims]]'', and developed robot control and personality simulation software for [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]]'s Stupid Fun Club.

He developed and refined [[pie menus]] for many platforms and applications including [[window manager]]s, [[Emacs]], ''SimCity'' and ''The Sims'', and published a frequently cited paper about pie menus at CHI'88 with John Raymond Callahan, [[Ben Shneiderman]] and [[Mark Weiser]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=57182 An empirical comparison of pie vs. linear menus]&lt;/ref&gt; He has published many [[free software]] and [[open source]] implementations of pie menus for [[X Window System|X10]], X11, [[NeWS]], [[Tcl/tk]], [[ScriptX]], [[ActiveX]], [[JavaScript]], [[OpenLaszlo]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[OLPC]], and also proprietary implementations for ''The Sims'' and the [[Palm Pilot]].

Hopkins also wrote demonstrations and programming examples of the ScriptX multimedia scripting language created by the Apple/IBM research spinoff [[Kaleida Labs]], developed various [[OpenLaszlo]] applications and components, and is a [[hacker artist]] known for his [http://www.art.net/Studios/Hackers/Hopkins/Don/art/cell.html artistic cellular automata]. He is also known for having written a chapter "The X-Windows Disaster" on [[X Window System]] in the book [[The UNIX-HATERS Handbook]].

==Micropolis==
{{main|Micropolis (software)}}

Recently Hopkins, supported by [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]], adapted ''SimCity'' for the [[One Laptop per Child|OLPC]] [[OLPC XO|XO-1 laptop]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donhopkins.com/drupal/node/131 History and Future of OLPC SimCity / Micropolis]&lt;/ref&gt; The current version includes pie menus and is explained in depth in a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpKhh10K-j0 video] released by Hopkins.

Since its primary objective is education, the OLPC project is looking not just for games, but for tools that enable kids to program their own games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Game_development Game development - OLPC]&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins programmed Micropolis to make it easy to extend in many interesting ways. He added functionality to let kids create new disasters and agents (like the monster, tornado, helicopter and train), and program them like in many of the other games on the XO. The goals of deeply integrating ''SimCity'' with OLPC's [[Sugar (software)|Sugar]] user interface are to focus on education and accessibility for younger kids, as well as motivating and enabling older kids to learn programming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donhopkins.com/drupal/taxonomy_menu/4/49/63/65 SimCity for OLPC: Applying Papert's Ideas About Constructionist Education and Teaching Kids to Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Sims''==
''[[The Sims]]'' is a virtual reality video game developed by [[Electronic Arts]]. The games are known for their very loose guidelines and no specific user goals. They allow the users to simply exist in the virtual world they create. Don Hopkins became involved in ''The Sims'' after he worked at [[Sun Microsystems]].&lt;ref name="resume" /&gt; ''The Sims'' were a theme in his work since then and he has contributed to much of the design and conceptual development of the game. He was hired to convert ''The Sims'' for Unix. He implemented the usage of pie menus to the game so that users could efficiently carry out actions in the game world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20472">The '''effective population size''' is the number of individuals that an [[idealised population]] would need to have, in order for some specified quantity of interest to be the same in the idealised population as in the real population. Idealised populations are based on unrealistic but convenient simplifications such as random mating, simultaneous birth of each new generation, constant population size, and equal numbers of children per parent. In some simple scenarios, the effective population size is the number of breeding individuals in the population. However, for most quantities of interest and most real populations, the [[population size|census population size]] ''N'' of a real population is usually larger than the effective population size ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/a-z/Effective_population_size.asp|title=Effective population size|accessdate=4 March 2018|work=[[Blackwell Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same population may have multiple effective population sizes, for different properties of interest, including for different genetic loci.

The effective population size is most commonly measured with respect to the [[Coalescent theory#Time to coalescence|coalescence time]]. In an idealised diploid population with no selection at any locus, the expectation of the [[Coalescent theory#Time to coalescence|coalescence time]] in generations is equal to twice the census population size. The effective population size is measured as within-species [[nucleotide diversity|genetic diversity]] divided by four times the [[mutation rate]], because in such an idealised population, the [[Coalescent theory#Neutral variation|heterozygosity]] is equal to  &lt;math&gt;4N\mu&lt;/math&gt;. In a population with selection at many loci and abundant linkage disequilibrium, the coalescent effective population size may not reflect the census population size at all, or may reflect its logarithm.

The concept of effective population size was introduced in the field of [[population genetics]] in 1931 by the [[United States|American]] [[geneticist]] [[Sewall Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wright S |year=1931 |title=Evolution in Mendelian populations |journal=[[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]] |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=97–159 |pmid=17246615 |pmc=1201091 |url=http://www.esp.org/foundations/genetics/classical/holdings/w/sw-31.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wright S |year=1938 |title=Size of population and breeding structure in relation to evolution |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=87 |pages=430–431 | doi = 10.1126/science.87.2263.425-a |issue=2263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview: Types of effective population size ==
Depending on the quantity of interest, effective population size can be defined in several ways. [[Ronald Fisher]] and [[Sewall Wright]] originally defined it as "the number of breeding individuals in an [[idealised population]] that would show the same amount of dispersion of [[allele frequency|allele frequencies]] under random [[genetic drift]] or the same amount of [[inbreeding]] as the population under consideration". More generally, an effective population size may be defined as the number of individuals in an idealised population that has a value of any given population genetic quantity that is equal to the value of that quantity in the population of interest. The two population genetic quantities identified by Wright were the one-generation increase in variance across replicate populations '''(variance effective population size)''' and the one-generation change in the inbreeding coefficient '''(inbreeding effective population size)'''. These two are closely linked, and derived from [[F-statistics]], but they are not identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Wright and Fisher on Inbreeding and Random Drift |journal=Genetics |author=James F. Crow |author-link=James F. Crow |year=2010 |volume=184 |issue=3 |pages=609–611 |doi=10.1534/genetics.109.110023 |pmc=2845331 |pmid=20332416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the effective population size is usually estimated empirically with respect to the [[mean sojourn time|sojourn]] or [[Coalescent theory#Time to coalescence|coalescence time]], estimated as the within-species [[nucleotide diversity|genetic diversity]] divided by the [[mutation rate]], yielding a '''coalescent effective population size'''.&lt;ref name="Lynch 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lynch, M. |author2=Conery, J.S. |title=The origins of genome complexity |journal=Science|year=2003|volume=302|issue=5649 |pages=1401–1404 |doi=10.1126/science.1089370 |pmid=14631042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important effective population size is the '''selection effective population size''' 1/s&lt;sub&gt;critical&lt;/sub&gt;, where s&lt;sub&gt;critical&lt;/sub&gt; is the critical value of the [[selection coefficient]] at which selection becomes more important than [[genetic drift]].&lt;ref name="Neher 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 188| pages = 975–996|author1=R.A.

=== Empirical measurements ===
In ''Drosophila'' populations of census size 16, the variance effective population size has been measured as equal to 11.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buri|first=P|journal=Evolution|year=1956|volume=10|pages=367–402|title=Gene frequency in small populations of mutant Drosophila|doi=10.2307/2406998}}&lt;/ref&gt; This measurement was achieved through studying changes in the frequency of a neutral allele from one generation to another in over 100 replicate populations.

For coalescent effective population sizes, a survey of publications on 102 mostly wildlife animal and plant species yielded 192 ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;/''N'' ratios. Seven different estimation methods were used in the surveyed studies. Accordingly, the ratios ranged widely from 10&lt;sup&gt;''-6''&lt;/sup&gt; for Pacific oysters to 0.994 for humans, with an average of 0.34 across the examined species.&lt;ref name="Frankham 1995"&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 66| pages = 95–107|author1=R. Frankham | title = Effective population size/adult population size ratios in wildlife: a review| journal = Genetics Research | year = 1995| doi = 10.1017/S0016672300034455 | issue = 2| pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A genealogical analysis of human hunter-gatherers ([[Eskimo]]s) determined the effective-to-census population size ratio for haploid (mitochondrial DNA, Y chromosomal DNA), and diploid (autosomal DNA) loci separately: the ratio of the effective to the census population size was estimated as 0.6–0.7 for autosomal and X-chromosomal DNA, 0.7–0.9 for mitochondrial DNA and 0.5 for Y-chromosomal DNA.&lt;ref name="Matsumura 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 275| pages = 1501–1508|author1=S.

== Variance effective size ==
'''References missing'''
In the [[Idealized population|Wright-Fisher idealized population model]], the [[conditional variance]] of the allele frequency &lt;math&gt;p'&lt;/math&gt;, given the [[allele frequency]] &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; in the previous generation, is

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{var}(p' \mid p)= {p(1-p) \over 2N}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\operatorname{var}}(p'\mid p)&lt;/math&gt; denote the same, typically larger, variance in the actual population under consideration.  The variance effective population size &lt;math&gt;N_e^{(v)}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the size of an idealized population with the same variance.  This is found by substituting &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\operatorname{var}}(p'\mid p)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{var}(p'\mid p)&lt;/math&gt; and solving for &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; which gives

:&lt;math&gt;N_e^{(v)} = {p(1-p) \over 2 \widehat{\operatorname{var}}(p)}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Theoretical examples ===

In the following examples, one or more of the assumptions of a strictly idealised population are relaxed, while other assumptions are retained. The variance effective population size of the more relaxed population model is then calculated with respect to the strict model.

==== Variations in population size ====

Population size varies over time.  Suppose there are ''t'' non-overlapping [[generation]]s, then effective population size is given by the [[harmonic mean]] of the population sizes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karlin|first=Samuel|date=1968-09-01|title=Rates of Approach to Homozygosity for Finite Stochastic Models with Variable Population Size|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/282557|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=102|issue=927|pages=443–455|doi=10.1086/282557|issn=0003-0147}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over N_e} = {1 \over t} \sum_{i=1}^t {1 \over N_i}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, say the population size was ''N'' = 10, 100, 50, 80, 20, 500 for six generations (''t'' = 6).  Then the effective population size is the [[harmonic mean]] of these, giving:

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;{1 \over N_e}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= {\begin{matrix} \frac{1}{10} \end{matrix} + \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{100} \end{matrix} + \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{50} \end{matrix} + \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{80} \end{matrix} + \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{20} \end{matrix} + \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{500} \end{matrix} \over 6} &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= {0.1945 \over 6}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= 0.032416667&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;N_e&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= 30.8&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Note this is less than the [[arithmetic mean]] of the population size, which in this example is 126.7. The harmonic mean tends to be dominated by the smallest [[population bottleneck|bottleneck]] that the population goes through.

==== Dioeciousness ====

If a population is [[dioecious]], i.e. there is no [[self-fertilisation]] then

:&lt;math&gt;N_e = N + \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

or more generally,

:&lt;math&gt;N_e = N + \begin{matrix} \frac{D}{2} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''D'' represents dioeciousness and may take the value 0 (for not dioecious) or 1 for dioecious.

When ''N'' is large, ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; approximately equals ''N'', so this is usually trivial and often ignored:

:&lt;math&gt;N_e = N + \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \approx N \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Variance in reproductive success ====

If population size is to remain constant, each individual must contribute on average two [[gamete]]s to the next generation.  An idealized population assumes that this follows a [[Poisson distribution]] so that the [[variance]] of the number of gametes contributed, ''k'' is equal to the [[mean]] number contributed, i.e. 2:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{var}(k) = \bar{k} = 2.&lt;/math&gt;

However, in natural populations the variance is often larger than this. The vast majority of individuals may have no offspring, and the next generation stems only from a small number of individuals, so

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{var}(k) &gt; 2.&lt;/math&gt;

The effective population size is then smaller, and given by:

:&lt;math&gt;N_e^{(v)} = {4 N - 2D \over 2 + \operatorname{var}(k)}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that if the variance of ''k'' is less than 2,  ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; is greater than ''N''.  In the extreme case of a population experiencing no variation in family size, in a laboratory population in which the number of offspring is artificially controlled, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2''N''.

==== Non-Fisherian sex-ratios ====

When the [[sex ratio]] of a population varies from the [[Ronald Fisher|Fisherian]] 1:1 ratio,  effective population size is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;N_e^{(v)} = N_e^{(F)} = {4 N_m N_f \over N_m + N_f}&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of males and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; the number of females.  For example, with 80 males and 20 females (an absolute population size of 100):
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;N_e&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= {4 \times 80 \times 20 \over 80 + 20}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;={6400 \over 100}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= 64&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Again, this results in ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; being less than ''N''.

==Inbreeding effective size==

Alternatively, the effective population size may be defined by noting how the average [[inbreeding coefficient]] changes from one generation to the next, and then defining ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; as the size of the idealized population that has the same change in average inbreeding coefficient as the population under consideration.  The presentation follows Kempthorne (1957).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kempthorne O |year=1957 |title=An Introduction to Genetic Statistics |publisher=Iowa State University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the idealized population, the inbreeding coefficients follow the recurrence equation

:&lt;math&gt;F_t = \frac{1}{N}\left(\frac{1+F_{t-2}}{2}\right)+\left(1-\frac{1}{N}\right)F_{t-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using Panmictic Index (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''F'') instead of inbreeding coefficient, we get the approximate recurrence equation

:&lt;math&gt;1-F_t = P_t = P_0\left(1-\frac{1}{2N}\right)^t. &lt;/math&gt;

The difference per generation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_{t+1}}{P_t} = 1-\frac{1}{2N}. &lt;/math&gt;

The inbreeding effective size can be found by solving

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_{t+1}}{P_t} = 1-\frac{1}{2N_e^{(F)}}. &lt;/math&gt;

This is

:&lt;math&gt;N_e^{(F)} = \frac{1}{2\left(1-\frac{P_{t+1}}{P_t}\right)} &lt;/math&gt;

although researchers rarely use this equation directly.

=== [[Theoretical]] example: overlapping generations and age-structured populations ===

When organisms live longer than one breeding season, effective population sizes have to take into account the [[life table]]s for the species.

==== Haploid ====
Assume a haploid population with discrete age structure.  An example might be an organism that can survive several discrete breeding seasons.  Further, define the following age structure characteristics:

: &lt;math&gt;v_i = &lt;/math&gt; [[Fisher's reproductive value]] for age &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;\ell_i = &lt;/math&gt; The chance an individual will survive to age &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, and

: &lt;math&gt;N_0 = &lt;/math&gt; The number of newborn individuals per breeding season.

The [[generation time]] is calculated as

: &lt;math&gt;T = \sum_{i=0}^\infty \ell_i v_i = &lt;/math&gt; average age of a reproducing individual

Then, the inbreeding effective population size is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Felsenstein J |year=1971 |title=Inbreeding and variance effective numbers in populations with overlapping generations | journal= [[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]]|volume= 68| issue= |pages=581–597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;N_e^{(F)} = \frac{N_0T}{1 + \sum_i\ell_{i+1}^2v_{i+1}^2(\frac{1}{\ell_{i+1}}-\frac{1}{\ell_i})}.&lt;/math&gt;

==== Diploid ====
Similarly, the inbreeding effective number can be calculated for a diploid population with discrete age structure.  This was first given by Johnson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Johnson DL |year=1977 |title=Inbreeding in populations with overlapping generations |journal=[[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]] |volume=87 |pages=581–591}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the notation more closely resembles Emigh and Pollak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0040-5809(79)90028-5 |vauthors=Emigh TH, Pollak E |year=1979 |title=Fixation probabilities and effective population numbers in diploid populations with overlapping generations |journal=Theoretical Population Biology |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=86–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assume the same basic parameters for the life table as given for the haploid case, but distinguishing between male and female, such as ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''ƒ''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; for the number of newborn females and males, respectively (notice lower case ''ƒ'' for females, compared to upper case ''F'' for inbreeding).

The inbreeding effective number is

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{N_e^{(F)}} = \frac{1}{4T}\left\{\frac{1}{N_0^f}+\frac{1}{N_0^m} + \sum_i\left(\ell_{i+1}^f\right)^2\left(v_{i+1}^f\right)^2\left(\frac{1}{\ell_{i+1}^f}-\frac{1}{\ell_i^f}\right)\right. \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, &amp; \\
 \left. {} + \sum_i\left(\ell_{i+1}^m\right)^2\left(v_{i+1}^m\right)^2\left(\frac{1}{\ell_{i+1}^m}-\frac{1}{\ell_i^m}\right) \right\}. &amp;
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Coalescent effective size ==

According to the [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]], a neutral allele remains in a population for Ne generations, where Ne is the effective population size. An idealised diploid population will have a pairwise [[nucleotide diversity]] equal to 4&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;Ne, where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the mutation rate. The sojourn effective population size can therefore be estimated empirically by dividing the nucleotide diversity by the mutation rate.&lt;ref name="Lynch 2003" /&gt;

The coalescent effective size may have little relationship to the number of individuals physically present in a population.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Measured coalescent effective population sizes vary between genes in the same population, being low in genome areas of low recombination and high in genome areas of high recombination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Toward a selection theory of molecular evolution|journal=Evolution|year=2008|volume=62|pages=255–265|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00308.x |author=Hahn, Matthew W.

[[Genetic hitchhiking]] can cause neutral mutations to have sojourn times proportional to log(N): this may explain the relationship between measured effective population size and the local recombination rate.

== Selection effective size ==

In an idealised Wright-Fisher model, the fate of an allele, beginning at an intermediate frequency, is largely determined by selection if the [[selection coefficient]] s ≫ 1/N, and largely determined by neutral genetic drift if s ≪ 1/N. In real populations, the cutoff value of s may depend instead on local recombination rates.&lt;ref name="Neher 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Environmental politics''' designate both the [[politics]] about the [[Natural environment|environment]]&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Dobson, ''Environmental Politics: A Very Short Introduction'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2016 ({{ISBN|978-0-19-966557-0}}).&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[environmental policy]]) and an [[academic field]] of study focused on three core components:&lt;ref name=Carter&gt;Carter, Neil. 2007. ''The Politics of the Environment: Ideas, Activism, Policy'', 2nd ed. New York: [[Cambridge University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-521-68745-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The study of [[Political science|political]] [[Social theory|theories]] and [[Political philosophy|ideas]] related to the [[natural environment|environment]];
* The examination of the environmental stances of both mainstream [[political party|political parties]] and [[environmental movement|environmental social movements]]; and
* The analysis of [[public policy]]making and [[public administration|implementation]] affecting the environment, at multiple [[geopolitics|geo-political]] [[Level of analysis|levels]].

Neil Carter, in his foundational text ''Politics of the Environment'' (2009), suggests that ''environmental'' politics is distinct in at least two ways: first, "it has a primary concern with the relationship between human society and the natural world" (page 3); and second, "unlike most other single issues, it comes replete with its own ideology and political movement" (page 5, drawing on Michael Jacobs, ed., ''Greening the Millenium?'', 1997).&lt;ref name=Carter/&gt;

Further, he distinguishes between modern and earlier forms of environmental politics, in particular [[conservation movement|conservationism]] and [[Wilderness#Preservation|preservationism]]. Contemporary environmental politics "was driven by the idea of a global ecological crisis that threatened the very existence of humanity." And "modern [[environmentalism]] was a political and activist mass movement which demanded a radical transformation in the values and structures of society."&lt;ref name=Carter/&gt;

Environmental concerns were rooted in the vast social changes that took place in the United States after World War II. Although environmentalism can be identified in earlier years, only after the war did it become widely shared social priority. This began with outdoor recreation in the 1950s, extended into the wider field of the protection of natural environments, and then became infused with attempts to cope with air and [[water pollution]] and still later with toxic chemical pollutants. After World War II, environmental politics became a major public concern.&lt;ref&gt;Hays, Samuel P., and Barbara D. Hays. Beauty, Health, and Permanence: Environmental Politics in the United States, 1955-1985. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of environmentalism in the United Kingdom emerged in this period following the great London smog of 1952 and the Torrey Canyon oil spill of 1967.&lt;ref&gt;http://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/21603/&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected by the emergence of [[Green politics]] in the Western world beginning in the 1970s.

== Democratic challenges ==
Climate change is slow relative to political cycles of leadership in [[Electoral system|electoral democracies]], which impedes responses by politicians who are elected and re-elected on much shorter timescales.&lt;ref name=Guerrero&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Against Elections: The Lottocratic Alternative|last = Guerrero|first = Alexander|date = 2014|journal = Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, although "environmentalism" was once considered a White phenomenon, scholars have identified "pro-environment positions among Latino, African-American, and non-Hispanic white respondents," with growing environmental concern especially among Latinos.&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, Matthew, Segura, and Bowler, Shaun (2005). "Racial/Ethnic Group Attitudes Toward Environmental Protection in California: Is "Environmentalism" Still a White Phenomenon?" ''Political Research Quarterly'' (58)3: pp. 435, 435-447.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have similarly noted that Asian Americans are strongly pro-environmental, with some variation among ethnic subgroups.&lt;ref&gt;Ong, Paul, Le, Loan and Daniels, Paula (2013) "Ethnic Variation in Environmental Attitudes and Opinion among Asian American Voters." ''AAPI Nexus: Policy, Practice and Community'' (11)1-2: pp. 91-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Effectively responding to [[global warming]] necessitates some form of international [[environmental governance]] to achieve shared targets related to energy consumption and environmental usage.&lt;ref name=Edmondson&gt;{{Cite book|title = Climate Change and Order|last = Edmondson and Levy|first = |publisher = |year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 50–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change complicates political ideology and practice, affecting conceptions of responsibility for future societies as well as economic systems.&lt;ref name=Edmondson/&gt; Material inequality between nations make technological solutions insufficient for climate change mitigation.&lt;ref name=Edmondson/&gt; Rather, political solutions can navigate the particularities of various facets of environmental crisis. Climate change mitigation strategies can be at odds with democratic priorities of prosperity, progress, and state sovereignty, and instead underscore a collective relationship with the environment.

The international political community is presently based on liberal principles that prioritize individual freedoms and capitalist systems that make quick and ambitious climate responses difficult.&lt;ref name=Edmondson/&gt; [[Interest group liberalism|Interest-group liberalism]] is guided by individual human priorities.&lt;ref name=Baber&gt;{{Cite book|title = Deliberative Environmental Politics|last = Baber and Bartlett|first = |publisher = |year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups unable to voice their self-interest, such as minorities without suffrage, or non-humans, are not included in the political compromise. Addressing environmental crises can be impeded when citizens of liberal democracies do not see environmental problems as impacting their lives, or when they lack the education to evaluate the importance of the problem.&lt;ref name=Mathews&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/alterlj16&amp;div=48&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals|title = Democracy and the Ecological Crisis|last = Mathews|first = Freya|date = 1991|journal = Legal Service Bulletin|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The human benefits from environmental exploitation and protection compete.&lt;ref name=Mathews/&gt; Considering the implications of ecological degradation for future human generations can give environmental concerns a basis in anthropocentric liberal democratic politics.

[[William Ophuls]] posits that liberal democracies are unfit to address environmental problems, and that the prioritization of these challenges would involve a transition to more authoritarian forms of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ecology and the Politics of Scarcity |last= Ophuls |first= William |authorlink= William Ophuls |publisher= W.H. Freeman and Company |year=1977 |isbn= |location= San Francisco|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others counter this by pointing to the past successes of environmental reform movements to improve water and air quality in liberal societies.&lt;ref name=Baber/&gt; In practice, environmentalism can improve democracy rather than necessitate its end, by expanding democratic participation and promoting political innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Democracy, Bureaucracy and Environmentalism|last = Paehlke|first = Robert| author-link= Robert C. Paehlke|date = 1988|journal = Journal of Environmental Ethics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tensions between liberal democracy and environmental goals raise questions about the possible limitations of democracy (or at least democracy as we know it): in its responsiveness to subtle but large-scale problems, its ability to work from a holistic societal perspective, its aptness in coping with environmental crisis relative to other forms of government.&lt;ref name=Mathews/&gt; Democracies do not have the provisions to make environmental reforms that are not mandated by voters, and many voters lack incentives or desire to demand policies that could compromise immediate prosperity. The question arises as to whether the foundation of politics is morality or practicality.&lt;ref name=Mathews/&gt; A scheme that conceives of and values the environment beyond its human utility, an [[environmental ethics]], could be crucial for democracies to respond to climate change.&lt;ref name=Mathews/&gt;

== Alternative forms of democracy for environmental policy ==
In political theory, [[deliberative democracy]] has been discussed as a political model more compatible with environmental goals. Deliberative democracy is a system in which informed political equals weigh values, information, and expertise, and debate priorities to make decisions, as opposed to a democracy based on interest aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = When the People Speak|last = Fishkin|first = James|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition of democracy emphasizes informed discussion among citizens in the decision making process, and encourages decisions to benefit the common good rather than individual interests.&lt;ref name=Baber/&gt; Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson claimed that reason prevails over self-interest in deliberative democracy, making it a more just system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7869.html|title = Why Deliberative Democracy|date = 2004|accessdate = |website = Princeton University Press|publisher = |last = Gutmann and Thompson|first = Amy and Dennis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broad perspective that this discursive model encourages could lead to a stronger engagement with environmental concerns.&lt;ref name=Baber/&gt;

In political theory, the lottery system is a democratic design that allows governments to address problems with future, rather than immediate, impacts. Deliberative bodies composed of randomly selected representatives can draft environmental policies that have short-term costs without considering the political consequences for re-election.&lt;ref name=Guerrero/&gt;

== New materialism and environmental justice ==
New materialism is a strain of thought in philosophy and the social sciences that conceives of all material as having life or agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = New Materialisms: Ontology, Agency, and Politics|last = Coole and Frost|first = |publisher = Duke University Press|year = 2010|isbn = |location = United States|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It criticizes frameworks of justice that center on human attributes like consciousness as insufficient for modern ethical problems that concern the natural environment. It is a post-humanist consideration of all matter that rejects arguments of utility that privilege humans. This politically relevant social theory combats inequality beyond the interpersonal plane.&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://isle.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/2/1.extract|title = Marxism and Ecocriticism|last = Newman|first = Lance|date = 2002|journal = Interdiscip Stud Lit Environ|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; People are ethically responsible for one another, and for the physical spaces they navigate, including animal and plant life, and the inanimate matter that sustains it, like soil. New materialism encourages political action according to this world vision, even if it is incompatible with economic growth.&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt;

[[Jane Bennett (political theorist)|Jane Bennett]] uses the term "vital materialism" in her book ''Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things''. She develops the concept of materialism with the aim of providing a stronger basis in political theory for environmental politics.

New materialists have invoked [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]] and other historical thinkers to trace the emergence of their philosophy and to justify their environmental claims:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = New Materialism: Interviews and Cartographies|last = Dolphijn and van der Tuin|first = Rick and Iris|publisher = Open Humanities Press|year = 2012|isbn = |location = Ann Arbor|pages = 67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"No justice ... seems possible or thinkable without the principle of some responsibility, beyond all living present, within that which disjoins the living present, before the ghosts of those who are not yet born or who are already dead [...]. Without this non-contemporaneity with itself of the living present ... without this responsibility and this respect for justice concerning those who are not there, of those who are no longer or who are not yet present and living, what sense would there be to ask the question 'where?' 'where tomorrow?' 'whither?'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Specters of Marx: The State of the Debt, the Work of Mourning and the New International|last = Derrida|first = Jacques|publisher = Routledge|year = 1993|isbn = |location = New York and London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;All material, living and dead, is interrelated in "the mesh" as described by [[Timothy Morton]]. As all matter is interdependent, humans have obligations to all parts of the material world, including those that are unfamiliar.

Brazil, Russia, India, and China (known as the "[[BRICS|BRIC]]" nations) are rapidly industrializing, and are increasingly responsible for global carbon emissions and the associated climate change. {{citationneeded|date=March 2017}} Other forms of [[environmental degradation]] have also accompanied the economic growth in these nations.&lt;ref name=Shaw&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/ieb/2012/03/01/choking-on-growth |title=Will Emerging Economies Repeat the Environmental Mistakes of their Rich Cousins? |date=1 March 2012 |accessdate= |website=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |publisher= |last=Shaw |first=William |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208095237/http://carnegieendowment.org/ieb/2012/03/01/choking-on-growth |archivedate=2015-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental degradation tends to motivate action more than the threat of global warming does, since air and water pollution cause immediate health problems, and because pollutants can damage natural resources, hampering economic potential.&lt;ref name=Shaw/&gt;

With rising incomes, environmental degradation tends to decrease in industrializing nations, as depicted in the Environmental Kuznets Curve (described in a section of the [[Kuznets curve|Kuznets Curve]] article). Citizens demand better air and water quality, and technology becomes more efficient and clean when incomes increase.&lt;ref name=Shaw/&gt; The level of income per capita needed to reverse the trend of environmental degradation in industrializing nations varies with the environmental impact indicator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://isecoeco.org/pdf/stern.pdf|title = The Environmental Kuznets Curve|date = June 2003|accessdate = |website = The International Society for Ecological Economics|publisher = |last = Stern|first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; More developed nations can facilitate eco-friendly transitions in emerging economies by investing in the development of clean technologies. {{citationneeded|date=March 2017}}

Laws implemented in response to environmental concerns vary by nation (see [[List of environmental laws by country]]).

=== China ===
China's environmental ills include acid rain, severe smog, and a reliance on coal-burning for energy.&lt;ref name=Economy&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cfr.org/china/chinas-environmental-challenge-political-social-economic-implications/p5573|title = China's Environmental Challenge: Political, Social and Economic Implications|date = 27 January 2003|accessdate = |website = Council on Foreign Relations|publisher = |last = Economy|first = Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt; China has instated environmental policies since the 1970s, and has one of the most extensive environmental conservation programs on paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1111%2Fj.1467-9701.2007.00883.x?r3_referer=wol&amp;tracking_action=preview_click&amp;show_checkout=1&amp;purchase_site_license=LICENSE_DENIED_NO_CUSTOMER|title = China's Environment: Problems and Policies|last = MacBean|first = Alasdair|date = 2007|journal = The World Economy|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, regulation and enforcement by the central government in Beijing are weak, so solutions are decentralized.

For history, laws, and policies, see [[Environmental policy in China]].

=== India ===
In 1976, the [[Constitution of India]] was amended to reflect environmental priorities, motivated in part by the potential threat of natural resource depletion to economic growth:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wildlife." (Art. 48A)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"It shall be the duty of every citizen of India [...] to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife, and to have compassion for living creatures." (Art. 51A)&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, in India, as in China, the implementation of written environmental policies, laws, and amendments has proven challenging. Official legislation by the central government (see a partial list at [[Environmental policy of the Government of India]]) is often more symbolic than practical.&lt;ref name=Dembowski&gt;{{Cite book|title = Taking the State to Court: Public Interest Litigation and the Public Sphere in Metropolitan India|last = Dembowski|first = Hans|publisher = Asia House|year = 2001|isbn = |location = online|pages = 63–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Ministry of Environment and Forests]] was established in 1985, but corruption within bureaucratic agencies, namely the influence of wealthy industry leaders, limited any attempts at enforcement of the policies put in place.&lt;ref name=Dembowski/&gt;

'''Epigenome editing''' or '''Epigenome engineering''' is a type of genetic engineering in which the [[epigenome]] is modified at specific sites using engineered molecules targeted to those sites (as opposed to whole-genome modifications). Whereas gene editing involves changing the actual DNA sequence itself, epigenetic editing involves modifying and presenting DNA sequences to proteins and other DNA binding factors that influence DNA function. By "editing” epigenomic features in this manner, researchers can determine the exact biological role of an epigenetic modification at the site in question.

The engineered proteins used for epigenome editing are composed of a DNA binding domain that target specific sequences and an effector domain that modifies epigenomic features. Currently, three major groups of DNA binding proteins have been predominantly used for epigenome editing: [[Zinc finger]] proteins, [[TAL effector|Transcription Activator-Like Effectors (TALEs)]] and nuclease deficient Cas9 fusions ([[CRISPR]]).

== General concept ==

Comparing genome-wide [[epigenetic]] maps with [[gene expression]] has allowed researchers to assign either activating or repressing roles to specific modifications. The importance of DNA sequence in regulating the epigenome has been demonstrated by using DNA motifs to predict epigenomic modification.&lt;ref name="Whitaker"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitaker JW|author2=Wang W|first=Chen Z|title=Predicting the human epigenome from DNA motifs|journal=Nature Methods|date=2014|doi=10.1038/nmeth.3065|volume=12|issue=3|pages=265–272|pmid=25240437|pmc=4344378}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further insights into mechanisms behind [[epigenetics]] have come from [[in vitro]] biochemical and structural analyses. Using [[model organism]]s, researchers have been able to describe the role of many [[chromatin]] factors through [[Gene knockout|knockout]] studies. However knocking out an entire chromatin modifier has massive effects on the entire genome, which may not be an accurate representation of its function in a specific context. As one example of this, [[DNA methylation]] occurs at [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repeat regions]], [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]], [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancers]], and [[gene]] bodies. Although [[DNA methylation]] at gene promoters typically correlates with gene repression, methylation at gene bodies is correlated with gene activation, and DNA methylation may also play a role in gene splicing.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Peter A.|title=Functions of DNA methylation: islands, start sites, gene bodies and beyond|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=29 May 2012|volume=13|issue=7|pages=484–492|doi=10.1038/nrg3230|pmid=22641018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The ability to directly target and edit individual methylation sites is critical to determining the exact function of DNA methylation at a specific site. Epigenome editing is a powerful tool that allows this type of analysis. For site-specific DNA methylation editing as well as for histone editing, genome editing systems have been adapted into epigene editing systems. In short, genome homing proteins with engineered or naturally occurring nuclease functions for gene editing, can be mutated and adapted into purely delivery systems. An epigenetic modifying enzyme or domain can be fused to the homing protein and local epigenetic modifications can be altered upon protein recruitment. 

=== Targeting proteins ===

==== TALE ====

The [[TAL effector|Transcription Activator-Like Effector (TALE)]] protein recognizes specific DNA sequences based on the composition of its [[DNA binding domain]].&lt;ref name="Gaj"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaj|first=Thomas|author2=Gersbach, Charles A. |author3=Barbas, Carlos F. |title=ZFN, TALEN, and CRISPR/Cas-based methods for genome engineering|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|date=2013|volume=31|issue=7|pages=397–405|doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2013.04.004|pmid=23664777|pmc=3694601}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows the researcher to construct different TALE proteins to recognize a target DNA sequence by editing the TALE's primary protein structure. The binding specificity of this protein is then typically confirmed using [[Chromatin Immunoprecipitation]] (ChIP) and [[Sanger sequencing]] of the resulting DNA fragment.&lt;ref name="Konermann"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Konermann|first=Silvana|author2=Brigham, Mark D. |author3=Trevino, Alexandro |author4=Hsu, Patrick D. |author5=Heidenreich, Matthias |author6=Le Cong |author7=Platt, Randall J. |author8=Scott, David A. |author9=Church, George M. |author10=Zhang, Feng|title=Optical control of mammalian endogenous transcription and epigenetic states|journal=Nature|date=2013|doi=10.1038/nature12466 |pmid=23877069 |pmc=3856241 |volume=500 |issue=7463|pages=472–6|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/11879742/3856241.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maeder"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maeder|first=Morgan L |author2=Angstman, James F |author3=Richardson, Marcy E |author4=Linder, Samantha J |author5=Cascio, Vincent M |author6=Tsai, Shengdar Q |author7=Ho, Quan H |author8=Sander, Jeffry D |author9=Reyon, Deepak |author10=Bernstein, Bradley E |author11=Costello, Joseph F |author12=Wilkinson, Miles F |author13=Joung, J Keith |title=Targeted DNA demethylation and activation of endogenous genes using programmable TALE-TET1 fusion proteins|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=2013|volume=31|issue=12|pages=1137–1142|doi=10.1038/nbt.2726 |pmid=24108092 |pmc=3858462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mendenhall"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mendenhall|first=Eric M|author2=Williamson, Kaylyn E |author3=Reyon, Deepak |author4=Zou, James Y |author5=Ram, Oren |author6=Joung, J Keith |author7= Bernstein, Bradley E |title=Locus-specific editing of histone modifications at endogenous enhancers|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=2013|volume=31|issue=12|pages=1133–1136|doi=10.1038/nbt.2701 |pmid=24013198 |pmc=3858395}}&lt;/ref&gt; This confirmation is still required on all TALE sequence recognition research.&lt;ref name="Voigt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voigt|first=Philipp|author2=Reinberg, Danny|title=Epigenome editing|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=2013|volume=31|issue=12|pages=1097–1099|doi=10.1038/nbt.2756|pmid=24316647}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When used for epigenome editing, these DNA binding proteins are attached to an effector protein. Effector proteins that have been used for this purpose include [[TET1|Ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1)]],&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt; [[LSD1|Lysine (K)-specific demethylase 1A (LSD1)]]&lt;ref name="Mendenhall" /&gt; and [[CIB1|Calcium and integrin binding protein 1 (CIB1)]].&lt;ref name="Konermann" /&gt;

==== Zinc finger proteins ====

The use of [[zinc finger]]-fusion proteins to recognize sites for epigenome editing has been explored as well. Maeder et al. has constructed a ZF-TET1 protein for use in DNA demethylation.&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt; These zinc finger proteins work similarly to [[TAL effector|TALE proteins]] in that they are able to bind to sequence specific sites in on the DNA based on their protein structure which can be modified. Chen et al. have successfully used a zinc finger DNA binding domain coupled with the [[TET1]] protein to induce demethylation of several previously silenced genes.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=H. |author2=Kazemier, H. G. |author3=de Groote, M. L. |author4=Ruiters, M. H. J. |author5=Xu, G.-L. |author6=Rots, M. G. |title=Induced DNA demethylation by targeting Ten-Eleven Translocation 2 to the human ICAM-1 promoter|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=2013|volume=42|issue=3|pages=1563–1574|doi=10.1093/nar/gkt1019 |pmid=24194590 |pmc=3919596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== CRISPR-Cas ====

The [[CRISPR|Clustered Regulatory Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)]]-Cas system functions as a DNA site-specific nuclease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.neb.com/tools-and-resources/feature-articles/crispr-cas9-and-targeted-genome-editing-a-new-era-in-molecular-biology|title=CRISPR/Cas9 and Targeted Genome Editing: A New Era in Molecular Biology {{!}} NEB|last=Biolabs|first=New England|website=www.neb.com|access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the well-studied type II CRISPR system, the Cas9 nuclease associates with a chimera composed of tracRNA and crRNA. This chimera is frequently referred to as a guide RNA (gRNA). When the Cas9 protein associates with a DNA region-specific gRNA, the Cas9 cleaves DNA at targeted DNA loci. However, when the D10A and H840A point mutations are introduced, a catalytically-dead Cas9 (dCas9) is generated that can bind DNA but will not cleave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.addgene.org/crispr/guide/|title=Addgene: CRISPR/Cas9 Guide|website=www.addgene.org|access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dCas9 system has been utilized for targeted epigenetic reprogramming in order to introduce site-specific DNA methylation. By fusing the [[DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 3A|DNMT3a]] catalytic domain with the dCas9 protein, dCas9-DNMT3a is capable of achieving targeted DNA methylation of a targeted region as specified by the present guide RNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDonald|first=James I.|last2=Celik|first2=Hamza|last3=Rois|first3=Lisa E.|last4=Fishberger|first4=Gregory|last5=Fowler|first5=Tolison|last6=Rees|first6=Ryan|last7=Kramer|first7=Ashley|last8=Martens|first8=Andrew|last9=Edwards|first9=John R.|date=2016-05-09|title=Reprogrammable CRISPR/Cas9-based system for inducing site-specific DNA methylation|url=http://bio.biologists.org/content/early/2016/05/03/bio.019067|journal=Biology Open|language=en|pages=866–74|doi=10.1242/bio.019067|issn=2046-6390|pmid=27170255|volume=5|issue=6|pmc=4920199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, dCas9 has been fused with the catalytic core of the human acetyltransferase [[EP300|p300]]. dCas9-p300 successfully catalyzes targeted acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hilton|first=Isaac B.|last2=D'Ippolito|first2=Anthony M.|last3=Vockley|first3=Christopher M.|last4=Thakore|first4=Pratiksha I.|last5=Crawford|first5=Gregory E.|last6=Reddy|first6=Timothy E.|last7=Gersbach|first7=Charles A.|date=2015-05-01|title=Epigenome editing by a CRISPR-Cas9-based acetyltransferase activates genes from promoters and enhancers|url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v33/n5/abs/nbt.3199.html|journal=Nature Biotechnology|language=en|volume=33|issue=5|pages=510–517|doi=10.1038/nbt.3199|issn=1087-0156|pmc=4430400|pmid=25849900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commonly used effector proteins ===

[[TET1]] induces demethylation of cytosine at [[CpG sites]]. This protein has been used to activate genes that are repressed by CpG methylation and to determine the role of individual CpG methylation sites.&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt; [[LSD1]] induces the demethylation of H3K4me1/2, which also causes an indirect effect of deacetylation on H3K27. This effector can be used on [[histones]] in enhancer regions, which can changes the expression of neighboring genes.&lt;ref name="Mendenhall" /&gt; [[CIB1]] is a light sensitive [[cryptochrome]], this cryptochrome is fused to the TALE protein. A second protein contains an interaction partner ([[CRY2]]) fused with a [[chromatin]]/DNA modifier (ex. [[SID4X]]). [[CRY2]] is able to interact with [[CIB1]] when the cryptochrome has been activated by illumination with blue light.&lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=H.|author2=Yu, X. |author3=Li, K. |author4=Klejnot, J. |author5=Yang, H. |author6=Lisiero, D. |author7= Lin, C. |title=Photoexcited CRY2 Interacts with CIB1 to Regulate Transcription and Floral Initiation in Arabidopsis|journal=Science|date=2008|volume=322|issue=5907|pages=1535–1539|doi=10.1126/science.1163927|pmid=18988809}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction allows the chromatin modifier to act on the desired location. This means that the modification can be performed in an inducible and reversible manner, which reduces long-term secondary effects that would be caused by constitutive epigenetic modification.&lt;ref name="Konermann" /&gt; 

== Applications ==

=== Studying enhancer function and activity ===

Editing of gene enhancer regions in the genome through targeted epigenetic modification has been demonstrated by Mendenhall et al. (2013).&lt;ref name="Mendenhall" /&gt; This study utilized a TALE-LSD1 effector fusion protein in order to target enhancers of genes, to induce enhancer silencing in order to deduce enhancer activity and gene control. Targeting specific enhancers followed by locus specific [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|RT-qPCR]] allows for the genes affected by the silenced enhancer to be determined. Alternatively, inducing enhancer silencing in regions upstream of genes allows for gene expression to be altered. [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|RT-qPCR]] can then be utilized to study effects of this on gene expression. This allows for enhancer function and activity to be studied in detail.&lt;ref name="Mendenhall" /&gt;

=== Determining the function of specific methylation sites ===

It is important to understand the role specific methylation sites play regulating in gene expression. To study this, one research group used a TALE-TET1 fusion protein to demethylate a single CpG methylation site.&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt; Although this approach requires many controls to ensure specific binding to target loci, a properly performed study using this approach can determine the biological function of a specific CpG methylation site.&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt;

=== Determining the role of epigenetic modifications directly ===

Epigenetic editing using an inducible mechanism offers a wide array of potential use to study epigenetic effects in various states. One research group employed an [[optogenetic]] two-hybrid system which integrated the sequence specific TALE DNA-binding domain with a light-sensitive cryptochrome 2 protein ([[CIB1]]).&lt;ref name="Konermann" /&gt; Once expressed in the cells, the system was able to inducibly edit histone modifications and determine their function in a specific context.&lt;ref name="Konermann" /&gt;

== Limitations ==

Sequence specificity is critically important in epigenome editing and must be carefully verified (this can be done using [[chromatin immunoprecipitation]] followed by [[Sanger sequencing]] to verify the targeted sequence).&lt;ref name="Voigt" /&gt; It is unknown if the TALE fusion may cause effects on the catalytic activity of the epigenome modifier. This could be especially important in effector proteins that require multiple subunits and complexes such as the [[Polycomb]] repressive complex.&lt;ref name="Voigt" /&gt; Proteins used for epigenome editing may obstruct ligands and substrates at the target site.&lt;ref name="Voigt" /&gt; The TALE protein itself may even compete with [[transcription factors]] if they are targeted to the same sequence.&lt;ref name="Voigt" /&gt; In addition, DNA repair systems could reverse the alterations on the chromatin and prevent the desired changes from being made.&lt;ref name="Voigt" /&gt; It is therefore necessary for fusion constructs and targeting mechanisms to be optimized for reliable and repeatable epigenome editing.

The '''European Space Research and Technology Centre''' ('''ESTEC''') is the [[European Space Agency]]'s main technology development and test centre for spacecraft and space technology. It is situated in [[Noordwijk]], [[South Holland]], in the western [[Netherlands]], although several kilometers off the village but immediately linked to the most Northern district of the nearby town [[Katwijk]].

At ESTEC, about 2500 engineers, technicians and scientists work hands-on with mission design, spacecraft and space technology. ESTEC provides extensive testing facilities to verify the proper operation of spacecraft, such as the Large Space Simulator (LSS), acoustic and electromagnetic testing bays, multi-axis vibration tables and the ESA Propulsion Laboratory (EPL). Prior to launch, almost all of the equipment that ESA launches is tested in some degree at ESTEC.

The Space Expo is ESTEC's visitors centre. It has a permanent exhibition about [[space exploration]].

== History ==
[[File:ExoMars (14042710527).jpg|thumb|Models of ExoMars [[Schiaparelli EDM lander|EDM ''Schiaparelli'']] and the [[ExoMars (rover)|ExoMars Rover]] at ESTEC, 2014]]
The European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) was founded in 1968. The centre was to be a facility at the very core of [[ESRO]]. Its responsibilities included the engineering and testing of satellites and their payloads, the integration of scientific instruments in these payloads, and making arrangements for their launch. In some cases member states were to produce the scientific instruments for ESRO or produce them as part of their own national effort and compensate ESTEC for its service. In practice, national organisations simply used ESTEC as a service organisation and left it to pay for their efforts from the ESRO budget. After the [[ESRO#The Bannier report and its consequences|Bannier Report]] the facility gained overall executive authority for spacecraft development and was merged with ESLAB. The satellite control centre was also moved to [[ESOC]]. ESTEC was originally to be located in [[Delft]] (South Holland) but because of unforeseen difficulties, [[Noordwijk]] was chosen instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=European Space Policy and Programs Handbook|author=Usa Ibp Usa|page=65|isbn=1433015323|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ESA Test Centre ==
In 1964 the ESRO (European Space Research Organization) decided to create an independent test centre that would be part of ESTEC. The first building with vibration and thermal vacuum facilities (named F-building) was completed in 1966&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/About_Us/Welcome_to_ESA/ESA_history/History_ESTEC_Noordwijk_1966|title=History: ESTEC, Noordwijk, 1966|publisher=[[ESA]]|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first satellite to be tested was the ESRO-1 satellite&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/About_Us/Welcome_to_ESA/ESA_history/History_ESRO-1_satellite_1968|title=History: ESRO-1 satellite, 1968|publisher=ESA|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1968. From the 1970s to the late 1980s the test centre was enlarged by following facilities: The Dynamic Test Chamber (DTC) in 1975, The Multishaker in 1983, The EMC facility in 1985, The Large Space simulator (by extending the DTC) in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/Large_Space_Simulator_LSS|title=Large Space Simulator (LSS)|publisher=ESA|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Large European Acoustic Facility (LEAF) in 1989 and the Compact Payload Test Range (CPTR) in 1990.

In the 1990s and 2000s the following major facilities have been added: The hydraulic shaker system (HYDRA), The Fr building with additional clean rooms (2000), The Large EMC facility (Maxwell) and the QUAD Shaker in 2008.

In 1997 the test operations and facilities maintenance activities were subcontracted to the COMET consortium and in the year 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.european-test-services.net/aboutus-overview.html|title=Overview European Test Services (ETS) B.V.|publisher=European Test Services|accessdate=10 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628010633/http://www.european-test-services.net/aboutus-overview.html|archivedate=28 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the test management, maintenance, operations and marketing of the test centre has been taken over by [[European Test Services]] B.V. (a subsidiary of [[IABG]] mbH and [[Intespace]] SA); The facilities are still belonging to ESA which is responsible for the facility development, test methodologies, test related engineering and subcontractor control.

Since the year 2000 not only tests for space industry have been performed but the facilities are also used for aerospace-, railway-, transport-, marine- and power- testing for customers like ABB, ALSTOM, Airbus, Bombardier and many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.european-test-services.net/aboutus-references.html|title=References Projects|publisher=European Test Services|accessdate=10 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628020417/http://www.european-test-services.net/aboutus-references.html|archivedate=28 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expression in Tissues ==
FAM231B is highly regulated in brain tissue and the spinal cord.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/genes/ENSG00000268991?bs=%7B%22homo%20sapiens%22:%5B%22ORGANISM_PART%22%5D%7D&amp;ds=%7B%22kingdom%22:%5B%22animals%22%5D%7D#baseline|title=Expression summary for FAM231B - homo sapiens &lt; Expression Atlas &lt; EMBL-EBI|last=github.com/gxa/atlas/graphs/contributors|first=EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas development team:|website=www.ebi.ac.uk|access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; From GeoProfiles, other tissues where expression is regulated are visceral fat, adipose, thyroid, breast, coronary artery, pancreas, colon, [[vaginal epithelium]], smooth muscle, and fallopian tube epithelium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geoprofiles/?term=FAM231B|title=FAM231B - GEO Profiles - NCBI|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation of Expression ==
FAM231B contains a [[Kozak consensus sequence]] surrounding the [[start codon]] nucleotides. The primary [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] region for the human FAM231B gene is 1443 base pairs long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genomatix.de/?s=92bdba0f25ae11f2a4087ab431736992|title=Genomatix - NGS Data Analysis &amp; Personalized Medicine|last=|first=|date=April 1, 2017|website=|publisher=Genomatix ElDorado|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Predicted regulation in the secondary structure are two [[Stem-loop|stem loops]] in the 5' UTR and two more in the 3' UTR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold/RNA-Folding-Form|title=The mfold Web Server|date=April 1, 2017|publisher=The RNA Institute, College of Arts and Sciences, State University of New York at Albany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
The function of the protein is not yet well understood in the scientific community. The protein contains domain of unknown function (DUF) 4741, which is part of the FAM231 family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/860609557|title=protein FAM231B [Homo sapiens] - Protein - NCBI|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Homology &amp; Evolution ==
[[File:Evolutiongraph.png|thumb|A graph comparing the evolutionary rate of FAM231B and its homologs to the Fibrinogen and Cytochrome C proteins.&amp;nbsp;]]
There are three human [[Paralogs|paralogs:]] FAM231A, FAM231C, and FAM231D and a comparison of the protein percent identity and similarity are found in the table below. There are three strict orthologs of FAM231B: in humans, the ''Pan troglodytes'' ([[Common chimpanzee|Common chimpanzee),]] and the ''Papio anubis'' ([[Olive baboon]]). No other orthologs are found beyond primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi|
title=BLAST: Basic Local Alignment Search Tool|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine|date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary rate of FAM231B was compared to [[Fibrinogen alpha chain|Fibrinogen]] and [[cytochrome c|Cytochrome C]]. FAM231B is predicted to have evolved faster than both of the proteins compared.

A "'''flip-flop'''" (used mostly in the United States), '''U-turn''' (used in the [[politics of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Pakistan]]), or '''backflip''' (used in Australia and New Zealand) is a sudden real or apparent change of policy or opinion by a public official, sometimes while trying to claim that both positions are consistent with each other. Often it will occur during the period prior to or following an election in order to maximize the candidate's popularity.

==History==

In his "On Language" column in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[William Safire]] wrote in 1988 that "flip-flop" has a long history as a synonym for "somersault". (He cited George Lorimer in 1902: "...when a fellow's turning flip-flops up among the clouds, he's naturally going to have the farmers gaping at him.") In the late 19th century, a US politician was called "the Florida flopper" by an opponent, Safire noted. The "fl" sound appearing twice is an indication of ridicule, he wrote. Citing grammarian Randolph Quirk, Safire pointed out that the doubling of the sound is also a feature in other two-word phrases used to disparage the actions or words of others, including "[[mumbo jumbo (phrase)|mumbo jumbo]]", "wishy-washy", and higgledy-piggledy".&lt;ref name="wsonnyt"&gt;Saffire, William, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3D6113DF930A25750C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all "Phantom of the Phrases "], "On Language" column, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', March 13, 1988 (comment from Wicker is as quoted by Safire), retrieved June 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In the archives of ''The New York Times'', which go back to 1851, the earliest unequivocal mention of "flip-flop" as a change in someone's opinion, is in an October 23, 1890, report of a campaign speech in New York City. John W. Goff, candidate for district attorney, said of one of his opponents: "I would like to hear Mr. Nicoll explain his great flip-flop, for three years ago, you know, as the Republican candidate for District Attorney, he bitterly denounced [[Tammany Hall|Tammany]] as a party run by bosses and in the interest of bossism.... Nicoll, who three years ago was denouncing Tammany, is its candidate to-day."&lt;ref&gt;No byline, [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1890/10/23/103273441.pdf "Mighty cheers for Scott / A great meeting in Cooper Union last night."], news article, ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 23, 1890, retrieved from ''Times'' subscription archives June 23, 2008 (sometimes accessible without subscription)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was also used in 1967, when a ''New York Times'' editorial and ''Times'' columnist [[Tom Wicker]] used it in commenting on different events. It was also in the [[U.S. Presidential election, 1976|1976 election]], when President [[Gerald Ford]] used the phrase against his opponent [[Jimmy Carter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/search/query?query=flip-flop&amp;srchst=p Search results for "flip-flop"], ''[[New York Times]]'' archives, 1850–1981, retrieved June 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 U.S. presidential election]], [[Michael Dukakis]] used the term against opponent [[Richard Gephardt]], saying, "There's a flip-flopper over here" about Gephardt.&lt;ref name="wsonnyt" /&gt;

The term also was used extensively in the [[2004 U.S. presidential election]] campaign. It was used by critics as a catch-phrase attack on [[John Kerry]], claiming he was "flip-flopping" his stance on several issues, including the ongoing war in Iraq. Famously, on March 16, 2004, during an appearance at [[Marshall University]] Kerry tried to explain his vote for an $87 billion supplemental appropriation for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan by telling the crowd, "I actually did vote for the $87 billion, before I voted against it." After the remark became controversial, he explained that he had supported an earlier Democratic measure that would have paid for the $87 billion in war funding by reducing Bush's tax cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kerry discusses $87 billion comment |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/09/30/kerry.comment/ |publisher=CNN |id= |date=September 30, 2004 |accessdate=November 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[FactCheck]] stated that "Kerry has never wavered from his support for giving Bush authority to use force in Iraq, nor has he changed his position that he, as President, would not have gone to war without greater international support."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.factcheck.org/bush_ad_twists_kerrys_words_on_iraq.html FactCheck.org: Bush Ad Twists Kerry's Words on Iraq] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209150357/http://www.factcheck.org/bush_ad_twists_kerrys_words_on_iraq.html |date=February 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "U-turn" in the United Kingdom was famously applied to [[Edward Heath]], the [[prime minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1970 to 1974. Prior to the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 general election]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] compiled a [[manifesto]] that highlighted [[free-market]] economic policies. Heath abandoned such policies when his government nationalised [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] (hence the actual "U-turn"). The Conservative government was later attacked for such a move because [[nationalisation]] was seen (by the [[Thatcherism|Thatcher era]]) as antithetical to Conservative beliefs. This later led to one of [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s most famous phrases: "[[The lady's not for turning|you turn [U-turn] if you want to. The lady's not for turning]]". The Conservatives would adopt the free market under her.

==Exculpatory, ameliorating and aggravating circumstances affecting public reaction==

The circumstances surrounding the flip-flop and its larger context can be crucial factors in whether or not a politician is hurt or helped more by a change in position. "Long hailed as a conservative champion, [[Ronald Reagan]] could shrug off his support of a tax increase in 1982 to curb the budget deficits his 1981 tax cut had exacerbated," according to an analysis of flip-flopping in ''The New York Times''. "Long suspect on the Republican right, [[George H. W. Bush|George [H. W.] Bush]] faced a crippling 1992 primary challenge after abandoning his 'no new taxes' campaign pledge in the White House."&lt;ref name="jhnyt"&gt;Harwood, John, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/23/us/politics/23caucus.html "Flip-Flops Are Looking Like a Hot Summer Trend"], "The Caucus" feature, ''The New York Times'', June 23, 2008, retrieved same day&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry's perceived equivocation on the Iraq war damaged his 2004 campaign, according to both Democratic and Republican political operatives. "It spoke to a pattern of calculation and indecisiveness that make him look like a weak commander in chief compared to [George W.] Bush", said Jonathan Prince, a strategist for 2008 presidential candidate [[John Edwards]], Kerry's running mate in 2004. In the 2008 primary season, Edwards simply stated that "I was wrong" when he had voted in the U.S. Senate to authorize the Iraq War. "Progressives loved it because it was taking responsibility, not abdicating it," according to Prince.&lt;ref name="jhnyt" /&gt;

United States commentator [[Jim Geraghty]] has written that politicians need to be allowed some leeway in changing their minds as the result of changing conditions. "I actually think that a candidate can even change his position in response to a changing political environment, as long as they're honest about it. 'The votes just aren't there, public support isn't there, so I have to put this proposal on the back burner for a while,' is a perfectly legitimate response to a difficult position."&lt;ref&gt;Geraghty, Jim, [http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MmVmYzM2NTEwZWI5MTI1ODgyNmUyZGMzMDU0ZTgyNzU= "Measuring the Flip-Flops"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} post at "The Campaign Spot" blog at the "National Review Online" website, June 23, 2008, 12:32&amp;nbsp;pm post, accessed same day{{Dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same general point was made in 1988 by ''New York Times'' editorial columnist [[Tom Wicker]], writing shortly after Dukakis' charge against Gephardt. Wicker commented that the accusation was not necessarily fair: "What's wrong with a Presidential candidate changing his position – though his opponents call it 'flip-flopping' – in order to improve his chances of winning? Nothing's wrong with it [...] unless the flipper [...] denies having done it," Wicker added that the charge can be "a tortured or dishonest interpretation of an opponent's record".&lt;ref name="wsonnyt" /&gt;

"[T]here's a difference between changing your policy position and breaking a promise," [[John Dickerson (journalist)|John Dickerson]], wrote in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' online magazine. "Breaking a promise is a problem of a higher order than changing a policy position. Our mothers told us not to break promises [...]"&lt;ref&gt;Dickerson, John, [http://www.slate.com/id/2194083?nav=wp "The Flip-Flop Brothers: Both McCain and Obama wobbled. Who will pay the price?"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine, June 20, 2008, 6:32&amp;nbsp;pm Eastern Time, retrieved June 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

James Pethokoukis, the "money and politics blogger" for ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' online, referring to 2008 presidential candidate [[John McCain]], noted that in changing a position a candidate can "trot out that famous [[John Maynard Keynes]] line, 'When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?'"&lt;ref&gt;Pethoukoukis, James, [https://www.usnews.com/blogs/capital-commerce/2008/6/16/7-ways-mccain-can-use-energy-to-beat-obama.html "7 Ways McCain Can Use Energy to Beat Obama"], "Capital Commerce" blog, ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' online, June 16, 2008, 01:02&amp;nbsp;pm ET, retrieved June 23, 2008{{Dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Keynes quote also has been mentioned by other commentators with regard to flip-flops, including James Broder, in a 2007 article in the ''[[International Herald-Tribune]]''.&lt;ref name="jbiht"&gt;Broder, John M., [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=140971 "In past, clues to way Fed chief met mortgage crisis"], ''[[The International Herald-Tribune]]'', August 19, 2007, retrieved June 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-political use==
Outside politics the use of the term is not as pejorative. A scientist or mathematician can often obtain some experimental results or logical proofs which causes one to flip flop on a previously held belief. Example: "I always assumed that there was an infinity, that all infinite numbers were equal, but I have flip flopped on that since I saw Georg Cantor's proof." Lewis Eigen, in his essay on the cultural difference between politics and scientists, observes, "To the scientist, failure to flip-flop in the face of contradictory evidence is irrational and dangerous behavior. And scientists will often flip-flop at almost light speed. Often it takes only a single observation to flip-flop thousands of scientifically learned people."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis D. Eigen, "Flip-Flop: Political Vice–Scientific Virtue". ''Scriptamus'', 2009, http://scriptamus.wordpress.com/2009/10/23/flip-flop-political-vice-scientific-virtue/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flower poster 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A poster with flowers or clusters of flowers produced by twelve species of flowering plants from different families.]]
[[File:Bloemenpanorama Maurice van Bruggen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Flowers in the [[Netherlands]].]]
A '''flower''', sometimes known as a '''bloom''' or '''[[blossom]]''', is the [[reproduction|reproductive]] structure found in [[flowering plant]]s (plants of the division [[Magnoliophyta]], also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce [[Diaspore (botany)|diaspores]] without fertilization ([[parthenocarpy]]). Flowers contain [[sporangium|sporangia]] and are the site where [[gametophyte]]s develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of [[pollen]]. After fertilization, the [[Ovary (botany)|ovary]] of the flower develops into [[fruit]] containing [[seed]]s.

In addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and used by humans to bring beauty to their environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual, [[religion]], [[medicine]] and as a source of food.

==Morphology==
{{anchor|Floral morphology}}
[[File:Ranunculus glaberrimus labelled.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Main parts of a mature flower ([[Ranunculus glaberrimus]]).]]
[[File:Mature flower diagram.svg|thumb|right|Diagram of flower parts.]]

=== Floral parts ===
The essential parts of a flower can be considered in two parts: the vegetative part, consisting of petals and associated structures in the perianth, and the reproductive or sexual parts. A stereotypical flower consists of four kinds of structures attached to the tip of a short stalk.  Each of these kinds of parts is arranged in a [[Whorl (botany)|whorl]] on the [[Receptacle (botany)|receptacle]].  The four main whorls (starting from the base of the flower or lowest node and working upwards) are as follows:

==== Perianth ====
{{main|Perianth|Sepal|Corolla (flower)}}
Collectively the calyx and corolla form the [[perianth]] (see diagram).
* ''[[sepal|Calyx]]'': the outermost whorl consisting of units called ''[[sepal]]s''; these are typically green and enclose the rest of the flower in the bud stage, however, they can be absent or prominent and petal-like in some species.
* ''[[petal|Corolla]]'': the next whorl toward the apex, composed of units called ''[[petal]]s'', which are typically thin, soft and colored to attract animals that help the process of [[pollination]].

==== Reproductive ====
{{main|Plant reproductive morphology|Androecium|Gynoecium}}
[[File:Lillium Stamens.jpg|thumb|Reproductive parts of Easter Lily (''Lilium longiflorum''). 1.&amp;nbsp;Stigma, 2.&amp;nbsp;Style, 3.&amp;nbsp;Stamens, 4.&amp;nbsp;Filament, 5.&amp;nbsp;Petal]]
* ''[[Androecium]]'' (from Greek ''andros oikia'': man's house): the next whorl (sometimes multiplied into several whorls), consisting of units called [[stamen]]s. Stamens consist of two parts: a stalk called a [[stamen|filament]], topped by an [[anther]] where [[pollen]] is produced by meiosis and eventually dispersed.
* ''[[Gynoecium]]'' (from Greek ''gynaikos oikia'': woman's house): the innermost whorl of a flower, consisting of one or more units called carpels. The [[Gynoecium#Carpels|carpel]] or multiple fused carpels form a hollow structure called an ovary, which produces ovules internally. Ovules are megasporangia and they in turn produce megaspores by meiosis which develop into female gametophytes. These give rise to egg cells. The gynoecium of a flower is also described using an alternative terminology wherein the structure one sees in the innermost whorl (consisting of an ovary, style and stigma) is called a pistil. A pistil may consist of a single carpel or a number of carpels fused together. The sticky tip of the pistil, the stigma, is the receptor of pollen. The supportive stalk, the style, becomes the pathway for [[pollen tube]]s to grow from pollen grains adhering to the stigma. The relationship to the gynoecium on the receptacle is described as '''hypogynous''' (beneath a superior ovary), '''perigynous''' (surrounding a superior ovary), or '''epigynous''' (above inferior ovary).

=== Structure ===
Although the arrangement described above is considered "typical", plant species show a wide variation in floral structure.&lt;ref name=Sattler73&gt;{{cite book |last=Sattler |first=R. |date=1973 |title=Organogenesis of Flowers. A Photographic Text-Atlas |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=978-0-8020-1864-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These modifications have significance in the evolution of flowering plants and are used extensively by botanists to establish relationships among plant species.

The four main parts of a flower are generally defined by their positions on the receptacle and not by their function.  Many flowers lack some parts or parts may be modified into other functions and/or look like what is typically another part. In some families, like [[Ranunculaceae]], the petals are greatly reduced and in many species the sepals are colorful and petal-like. Other flowers have modified stamens that are petal-like; the double flowers of [[Peonie]]s and [[Rose]]s are mostly petaloid stamens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Reynolds, Joan |author2=Tampion, John | title=Double flowers: a scientific study | year=1983 | publisher=[Published for the] Polytechnic of Central London Press [by] Pembridge Press | location=London  | isbn=978-0-86206-004-6 | page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flowers show great variation and plant scientists describe this variation in a systematic way to identify and distinguish species.

Specific terminology is used to describe flowers and their parts. Many flower parts are fused together; fused parts originating from the same whorl are '''[[Connation|connate]]''',  while fused parts originating from different whorls are '''[[Adnation|adnate]]'''; parts that are not fused are '''free'''.  When petals are fused into a tube or ring that falls away as a single unit, they are sympetalous (also called '''gamopetalous''').  Connate petals may have distinctive regions: the cylindrical base is the tube, the expanding region is the throat and the flaring outer region is the limb. A sympetalous flower, with bilateral symmetry with an upper and lower lip, is '''bilabiate'''.  Flowers with connate petals or sepals may have various shaped corolla or calyx, including campanulate, funnelform, tubular, urceolate, salverform or rotate.

Referring to "fusion," as it is commonly done, appears questionable because at least some of the processes involved may be non-fusion processes. For example, the addition of intercalary growth at or below the base of the primordia of floral appendages such as sepals, petals, stamens and carpels may lead to a common base that is not the result of fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sattler |first=R. |date=1978 |title='Fusion' and 'continuity' in floral morphology |journal=Notes of the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh |volume=36 |pages=397–405}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Greyson |first=R.I. |date=1994 |title=The Development of Flowers |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-506688-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leins |first1=P. |last-author-amp=yes |last2=Erbar |first2=C. |date=2010 |title=Flower and Fruit |publisher=Schweizerbart Science Publishers |location=Stuttgart |isbn=978-3-510-65261-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Peloric Streptocarpus flower.jpg|thumb|Left: A normal zygomorphic Streptocarpus flower. Right: An aberrant [[peloric]] Streptocarpus flower. Both of these flowers appeared on the Streptocarpus hybrid 'Anderson's Crows' Wings'.]]
Many flowers have a symmetry. When the [[perianth]] is bisected through the central axis from any point and symmetrical halves are produced, the flower is said to be [[actinomorphic]] or regular, e.g. rose or trillium. This is an example of [[radial symmetry]]. When flowers are bisected and produce only one line that produces symmetrical halves, the flower is said to be irregular or [[zygomorphic]], e.g. snapdragon or most orchids.

Flowers may be directly attached to the plant at their base (sessile—the supporting stalk or stem is highly reduced or absent). The stem or stalk subtending a flower is called a [[peduncle (botany)|peduncle]]. If a peduncle supports more than one flower, the stems connecting each flower to the main axis are called [[pedicel (botany)|pedicels]]. The apex of a flowering stem forms a terminal swelling which is called the ''torus'' or receptacle.

====Inflorescence====
[[File:White and yellow flower.JPG|thumb|right|The familiar [[Zantedeschia aethiopica|calla lily]] is not a single flower. It is actually an [[inflorescence]] of tiny flowers pressed together on a central stalk that is surrounded by a large petal-like [[bract]].]]
{{Main|Inflorescence}}
In those species that have more than one flower on an axis, the collective cluster of flowers is termed an ''[[inflorescence]]''. Some inflorescences are composed of many small flowers arranged in a formation that resembles a single flower. The common example of this is most members of the very large composite (Asteraceae) group. A single [[Bellis perennis|daisy]] or [[sunflower]], for example, is not a flower but a flower ''[[head (botany)|head]]''—an inflorescence composed of numerous flowers (or florets). An inflorescence may include specialized stems and modified leaves known as [[bract]]s.

==== Floral diagrams and floral formulae ====
{{main|Floral formula|Floral diagram}}
A ''floral formula'' is a way to represent the structure of a flower using specific letters, numbers and symbols, presenting substantial information about the flower in a compact form. It can represent a [[taxon]], usually giving ranges of the numbers of different organs, or particular species. Floral formulae have been developed in the early 19th century and their use has declined since. Prenner ''et al.'' (2010) devised an extension of the existing model to broaden the descriptive capability of the formula.&lt;ref name=prenner&gt;{{cite journal |last=Prenner |first=Gernard |title=Floral formulae updated for routine inclusion in formal taxonomic descriptions |journal=Taxon |date=February 2010 |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=241–250 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1175371 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329233442/http://www.academia.edu/1175371/Floral_formulae_updated_for_routine_inclusion_in_formal_taxonomic_descriptions |archivedate=2018-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The format of floral formulae differs in different parts of the world, yet they convey the same information.&lt;ref name=decraene&gt;{{cite book |last=de Craene |first=Louis P.

St. John's University, Collegeville, MN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140624001630/http://employees.csbsju.edu/ssaupe/biol308/Lecture/floral_form.htm |date=2014-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of a flower can also be expressed by the means of ''[[floral diagram]]s''. The use of schematic diagrams can replace long descriptions or complicated drawings as a tool for understanding both floral structure and evolution. Such diagrams may show important features of flowers, including the relative positions of the various organs, including the presence of fusion and symmetry, as well as structural details.&lt;ref name=decraene/&gt;

==Development==
A flower develops on a modified shoot or ''axis'' from a determinate apical [[meristem]] (''determinate'' meaning the axis grows to a set size). It has compressed internodes, bearing structures that in classical plant morphology are interpreted as highly modified [[leaf|leaves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eames |first=A.J. |date=1961 |title=Morphology of the Angiosperms |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Co. |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed developmental studies, however, have shown that stamens are often initiated more or less like [[Aerial stem modification|modified stems]] (caulomes) that in some cases may even resemble branchlets.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sattler73/&gt; Taking into account the whole diversity in the development of the androecium of flowering plants, we find a continuum between modified leaves (phyllomes), modified stems (caulomes), and modified branchlets (shoots).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sattler |first=R. |date=1988 |chapter=A dynamic multidimensional approach to floral development |editor1-last=Leins |editor1-first=P. |editor2-last=Tucker |editor2-first=S.C. |last-author-amp=yes |editor3-last=Endress |editor3-first=P.K. |title=Aspects of Floral Development |location=Berlin |publisher=J. Cramer/Borntraeger |pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sattler |first1=R. |last-author-amp=yes |last2=Jeune |first2=B. |date=1992 |title=Multivariate analysis confirms the continuum view of plant form |journal=Annals of Botany |volume=69 |pages=249–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flowering transition===
The transition to flowering is one of the major phase changes that a plant makes during its life cycle.  The transition must take place at a time that is favorable for [[fertilization]] and the formation of [[seeds]], hence ensuring maximal [[reproductive]] success.  To meet these needs a plant is able to interpret important endogenous and environmental cues such as changes in levels of [[plant hormones]] and seasonable [[temperature]] and [[photoperiod]] changes.&lt;ref name="Ausin2005"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ausín, I. |year=2005 |title=Environmental regulation of flowering |journal=Int J Dev Biol |volume=49 |pages=689–705 |doi=10.1387/ijdb.052022ia |pmid=16096975 |issue=5–6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Perennial plant|perennial]] and most [[Biennial plant|biennial]] plants require [[vernalization]] to flower. The molecular interpretation of these signals is through the transmission of a complex signal known as [[florigen]], which involves a variety of genes, including CONSTANS, FLOWERING LOCUS C and FLOWERING LOCUS T. Florigen is produced in the leaves in reproductively favorable conditions and acts in [[bud]]s and growing tips to induce a number of different physiological and morphological changes.&lt;ref name="Turck2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Turck, F. |author2=Fornara, F. |author3=Coupland, G. |year=2008 |title=Regulation and Identity of Florigen: FLOWERING LOCUS T Moves Centre Stage| journal=Annual Review of Plant Biology |volume=59 |pages=573–594 |doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.59.032607.092755 |pmid=18444908|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0012-374F-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first step of the transition is the transformation of the vegetative stem primordia into floral primordia. This occurs as biochemical changes take place to change cellular differentiation of leaf, bud and stem tissues into tissue that will grow into the reproductive organs. Growth of the central part of the stem tip stops or flattens out and the sides develop protuberances in a whorled or spiral fashion around the outside of the stem end. These protuberances develop into the sepals, petals, stamens, and [[carpel]]s. Once this process begins, in most plants, it cannot be reversed and the stems develop flowers, even if the initial start of the flower formation event was dependent of some environmental cue.&lt;ref name="Searle2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Searle, I. |year=2006 |title=The transcription factor FLC confers a flowering response to vernalization by repressing meristem competence and systemic signaling in Arabidopsis |journal=Genes Dev. |volume=20 |pages=898–912 |doi=10.1101/gad.373506 |pmid=16600915 |issue=7 |pmc=1472290|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the process begins, even if that cue is removed the stem will continue to develop a flower.

[[Yvonne Aitken]] has shown that flowering transition depends on a number of factors, and that plants flowering earliest under given conditions had the least dependence on climate whereas later-flowering varieties reacted strongly to the climate setup.

===Organ development===
{{main|ABC model of flower development}}
[[File:ABC flower development.svg|thumb|upright|The ABC model of flower development]]
The molecular control of floral organ identity determination appears to be fairly well understood in some species.  In a simple model, three gene activities interact in a combinatorial manner to determine the developmental identities of the organ primordia within the floral [[meristem]].  These gene functions are called A, B and C-gene functions.  In the first floral whorl only A-genes are expressed, leading to the formation of sepals.  In the second whorl both A- and B-genes are expressed, leading to the formation of petals.  In the third whorl, B and C genes interact to form stamens and in the center of the flower C-genes alone give rise to carpels.  The model is based upon studies of mutants in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' and snapdragon, ''[[Antirrhinum majus]]''.  For example, when there is a loss of B-gene function, mutant flowers are produced with sepals in the first whorl as usual, but also in the second whorl instead of the normal petal formation.  In the third whorl the lack of B function but presence of C-function mimics the fourth whorl, leading to the formation of carpels also in the third whorl.

Most genes central in this model belong to the [[MADS-box]] genes and are [[transcription factors]] that regulate the expression of the genes specific for each floral organ.

==Floral function==
{{see also|Plant reproductive morphology}}
[[File:Crateva religiosa.jpg|thumb|A "perfect flower", this ''[[Crateva religiosa]]'' flower has both stamens (outer ring) and a pistil (center).]]
The principal purpose of a flower is the reproduction of the individual and the species.  All flowering plants are ''heterosporous'', producing two types of [[spore]]s. Microspores are produced by meiosis inside anthers while megaspores are produced inside ovules, inside an ovary. In fact, anthers typically consist of four microsporangia and an ovule is an integumented megasporangium. Both types of spores develop into gametophytes inside sporangia. As with all heterosporous plants, the gametophytes also develop inside the spores (are endosporic).

In the majority of species, individual flowers have both functional carpels and stamens. Botanists describe these flowers as being ''perfect'' or ''bisexual'' and the species as [[Hermaphrodite|''hermaphroditic'']]. Some flowers lack one or the other reproductive organ and called ''imperfect'' or ''unisexual''. If unisex flowers are found on the same individual plant but in different locations, the species is said to be ''[[Plant sexuality|monoecious]]''. If each type of unisex flower is found only on separate individuals, the plant is ''[[Plant sexuality|dioecious]]''.

===Flower specialization and pollination===
{{further|Pollination syndrome}}
Flowering plants usually face selective pressure to optimize the transfer of their [[pollen]], and this is typically reflected in the morphology of the flowers and the behaviour of the plants. Pollen may be transferred between plants via a number of 'vectors'. Some plants make use of abiotic vectors&amp;nbsp;— namely wind ([[anemophily]]) or, much less commonly,  water ([[hydrophily]]). Others use biotic vectors including insects ([[entomophily]]), birds ([[ornithophily]]), bats ([[chiropterophily]]) or other animals. Some plants make use of multiple vectors, but many are highly specialised.

[[Cleistogamy|Cleistogamous flowers]] are self-pollinated, after which they may or may not open. Many Viola and some Salvia species are known to have these types of flowers.

The flowers of plants that make use of biotic pollen vectors commonly have glands called [[nectar]]ies that act as an incentive for animals to visit the flower. Some flowers have patterns, called [[nectar guide]]s, that show pollinators where to look for nectar. Flowers also attract pollinators by scent and color. Still other flowers use mimicry to attract pollinators. Some species of orchids, for example, produce flowers resembling female bees in color, shape, and scent. Flowers are also specialized in shape and have an arrangement of the [[stamen]]s that ensures that pollen grains are transferred to the bodies of the pollinator when it lands in search of its attractant (such as nectar, pollen, or a mate). In pursuing this attractant from many flowers of the same species, the pollinator transfers pollen to the stigmas—arranged with equally pointed precision—of all of the flowers it visits.

[[Anemophily|Anemophilous flowers]] use the wind to move pollen from one flower to the next. Examples include grasses, birch trees, ragweed and maples. They have no need to attract pollinators and therefore tend not to be "showy" flowers. Male and female reproductive organs are generally found in separate flowers, the male flowers having a number of long filaments terminating in exposed stamens, and the female flowers having long, feather-like stigmas. Whereas the pollen of animal-pollinated flowers tends to be large-grained, sticky, and rich in [[protein]] (another "reward" for pollinators), anemophilous flower pollen is usually small-grained, very light, and of little nutritional value to animals.

==Pollination==
{{main|Pollination}}
[[File:Bees Collecting Pollen cropped.jpg|right|thumb|Grains of pollen sticking to this bee will be transferred to the next flower it visits]]
The primary purpose of a flower is [[reproduction]]. Since the flowers are the reproductive organs of plant, they mediate the joining of the sperm, contained within pollen, to the ovules&amp;nbsp;— contained in the ovary. Pollination is the movement of pollen from the anthers to the stigma. The joining of the sperm to the ovules is called fertilization. Normally pollen is moved from one plant to another, but many plants are able to self pollinate. The fertilized ovules produce seeds that are the next generation.  Sexual reproduction produces genetically unique offspring, allowing for [[adaptation]]. Flowers have specific designs which encourages the transfer of pollen from one plant to another of the same species. Many plants are dependent upon external factors for pollination, including: wind and animals, and especially [[insect]]s. Even large animals such as birds, bats, and [[pygmy possum]]s can be employed. The period of time during which this process can take place (the flower is fully expanded and functional) is called ''anthesis''. The study of pollination by insects is called ''[[anthecology]]''.

===Pollination mechanism===
The pollination mechanism employed by a plant depends on what method of pollination is utilized.

Most flowers can be divided between two broad groups of pollination methods:

''Entomophilous'': flowers attract and use insects, bats, birds or other animals to transfer pollen from one flower to the next. Often they are specialized in shape and have an arrangement of the stamens that ensures that pollen grains are transferred to the bodies of the pollinator when it lands in search of its attractant (such as nectar, pollen, or a mate). In pursuing this attractant from many flowers of the same species, the pollinator transfers pollen to the stigmas—arranged with equally pointed precision—of all of the flowers it visits. Many flowers rely on simple proximity between flower parts to ensure pollination. Others, such as the ''[[Sarracenia#Flowers|Sarracenia]]'' or [[Lady's Slipper|lady-slipper orchids]], have elaborate designs to ensure pollination while preventing [[self-pollination]].

[[File:Grassflower.svg|right|thumb|Grass flower with vestigial perianth or lodicules]]''Anemophilous'': flowers use the wind to move pollen from one flower to the next, examples include the [[Poaceae|grasses]], Birch trees, Ragweed and Maples.  They have no need to attract pollinators and therefore tend not to grow large blossoms. Whereas the pollen of entomophilous flowers tends to be large-grained, sticky, and rich in [[protein]] (another "reward" for pollinators), anemophilous flower pollen is usually small-grained, very light, and of little nutritional value to [[insect]]s, though it may still be gathered in times of dearth. Honeybees and bumblebees actively gather anemophilous corn ([[maize]]) pollen, though it is of little value to them.

Some flowers with both stamens and a pistil are capable of self-fertilization, which does increase the chance of producing seeds but limits genetic variation. The extreme case of self-fertilization occurs in flowers that always self-fertilize, such as many [[dandelion]]s. Some flowers are self-pollinated and use flowers that never open or are self-pollinated before the flowers open, these flowers are called [[Cleistogamy|cleistogamous]]. Many Viola species and some Salvia have these types of flowers. Conversely, many species of plants have ways of preventing self-fertilization. Unisexual male and female flowers on the same plant may not appear or mature at the same time, or pollen from the same plant may be incapable of fertilizing its ovules. The latter flower types, which have chemical barriers to their own pollen, are referred to as self-sterile or self-incompatible.

===Attraction methods===
[[File:Ophrys apifera flower1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[Ophrys apifera|Bee orchid]] has evolved over many generations to better mimic a female bee to attract male bees as pollinators.]]
Plants cannot move from one location to another, thus many flowers have evolved to attract animals to transfer pollen between individuals in dispersed populations. Flowers that are insect-pollinated are called ''entomophilous''; literally "insect-loving" in Greek. They can be highly modified along with the pollinating insects by [[co-evolution]]. Flowers commonly have glands called ''nectaries'' on various parts that attract animals looking for nutritious [[nectar]]. [[Bird]]s and [[bee]]s have color vision, enabling them to seek out "colorful" flowers.

Some flowers have patterns, called [[nectar guide]]s, that show pollinators where to look for nectar; they may be visible only under [[ultraviolet]] light, which is visible to bees and some other insects. Flowers also attract pollinators by [[Floral scent|scent]] and some of those scents are pleasant to our sense of smell. Not all flower scents are appealing to humans; a number of flowers are pollinated by insects that are attracted to rotten flesh and have flowers that smell like dead animals, often called [[Carrion flower]]s, including ''[[Rafflesia]]'', the [[titan arum]], and the North American [[Asimina triloba|pawpaw]] (''Asimina triloba''). Flowers pollinated by night visitors, including bats and moths, are likely to concentrate on scent to attract pollinators and most such flowers are white.

Other flowers use mimicry to attract pollinators. Some species of orchids, for example, produce flowers resembling female bees in color, shape, and scent. Male bees move from one such flower to another in search of a mate.

===Flower-pollinator relationships===
Many flowers have close relationships with one or a few specific pollinating organisms. Many flowers, for example, attract only one specific species of insect, and therefore rely on that insect for successful reproduction.  This close relationship is often given as an example of [[coevolution]], as the flower and pollinator are thought to have developed together over a long period of time to match each other's needs.

This close relationship compounds the negative effects of [[extinction]]. The extinction of either member in such a relationship would mean almost certain extinction of the other member as well. Some [[endangered species|endangered plant species]] are so because of [[pollinator decline|shrinking pollinator populations]].

===Pollen allergy===
There is much confusion about the role of flowers in allergies. For example, the showy and entomophilous [[goldenrod]] (''Solidago'') is frequently blamed for [[hay fever|respiratory allergies]], of which it is innocent, since its pollen cannot be airborne. The types of pollen that most commonly cause allergic reactions are produced by the plain-looking plants (trees, grasses, and weeds) that do not have showy flowers. These plants make small, light, dry pollen grains that are custom-made for wind transport.

The type of allergens in the pollen is the main factor that determines whether the pollen is likely to cause hay fever. For example, pine tree pollen is produced in large amounts by a common tree, which would make it a good candidate for causing allergy. It is, however, a relatively rare cause of allergy because the types of allergens in pine pollen appear to make it less allergenic. Instead the [[allergen]] is usually the pollen of the contemporary bloom of anemophilous [[ragweed]] (''Ambrosia''), which can drift for many miles. Scientists have collected samples of ragweed pollen 400 miles out at sea and 2 miles high in the air.&lt;ref name="ragweedpollen"&gt;{{cite web |website=National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases |title=Pollen Allergy |accessdate=2016-05-24 |url=https://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/allergicdiseases/understanding/pollenallergy/Pages/about.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410034557/http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/allergicdiseases/understanding/pollenallergy/Pages/about.aspx |archivedate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single ragweed plant can generate a million grains of pollen per day.&lt;ref name="ragweedpollenproduction"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://masslung.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/pollenallergies.pdf |title=Pollen Allergy |accessdate=2014-04-10 |website=Mass Lung &amp; Allergy, PC |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2014-04-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413144808/http://masslung.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/pollenallergies.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among North American plants, weeds are the most prolific producers of allergenic pollen.&lt;ref name="weedscausepollen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accuweather.com/en/health-articles/allergies/pollen-allergy/25706 |title=Pollen Allergy |date=April 14, 2010 |website=AccuWeather |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413142553/http://www.accuweather.com/en/health-articles/allergies/pollen-allergy/25706 |archivedate=April 13, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ragweed is the major culprit, but other important sources are sagebrush, redroot pigweed, lamb's quarters, Russian thistle (tumbleweed), and English plantain.

It is common to hear people say they are allergic to colorful or scented flowers like roses. In fact, only florists, gardeners, and others who have prolonged, close contact with flowers are likely to be sensitive to pollen from these plants. Most people have little contact with the large, heavy, waxy pollen grains of such flowering plants because this type of pollen is not carried by wind but by insects such as butterflies and bees.

[[File:Archaefructus liaoningensis.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Archaefructus|Archaefructus liaoningensis]]'', one of the earliest known flowering plants]]
While land plants have existed for about 425 million years, the first ones [[plant sexuality|reproduced]] by a simple adaptation of their aquatic counterparts: [[spore]]s. In the sea, plants—and some animals—can simply scatter out genetic [[Cloning|clones]] of themselves to float away and grow elsewhere. This is how early plants reproduced. But plants soon evolved methods of protecting these copies to deal with drying out and other damage which is even more likely on land than in the sea. The protection became the [[seed]], though it had not yet evolved the flower. Early seed-bearing plants include the [[ginkgo]] and [[conifer]]s.

Several groups of extinct gymnosperms, particularly [[seed fern]]s, have been proposed as the ancestors of flowering plants but there is no continuous fossil evidence showing exactly how flowers evolved. The apparently sudden appearance of relatively modern flowers in the fossil record posed such a problem for the theory of evolution that it was called an "abominable mystery" by [[Charles Darwin]]. Recently discovered angiosperm fossils such as ''Archaefructus'', along with further discoveries of fossil gymnosperms, suggest how angiosperm characteristics may have been acquired in a series of steps. An early fossil of a flowering plant, ''[[Archaefructus|Archaefructus liaoningensis]]'' from China, is dated about 125 million years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/flower/anatomy.html |title=Flowers Modern &amp; Ancient |author=Susan K.

The similarity in [[leaf]] and [[Plant stem|stem]] structure can be very important, because flowers are genetically just an adaptation of normal leaf and stem components on plants, a combination of genes normally responsible for forming new shoots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unisci.com/stories/20012/0615015.htm |title=Age-Old Question On Evolution Of Flowers Answered |publisher=Unisci.com |date=2001-06-15 |accessdate=2010-08-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610212816/http://www.unisci.com/stories/20012/0615015.htm |archivedate=2010-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most primitive flowers are thought to have had a variable number of flower parts, often separate from (but in contact with) each other. The flowers would have tended to grow in a spiral pattern, to be [[bisexual]] (in plants, this means both male and female parts on the same flower), and to be dominated by the [[ovary (plants)|ovary]] (female part). As flowers grew more advanced, some variations developed parts fused together, with a much more specific number and design, and with either specific sexes per flower or plant, or at least "ovary inferior".

The general assumption is that the function of flowers, from the start, was to involve animals in the reproduction process. Pollen can be scattered without bright colors and obvious shapes, which would therefore be a liability, using the plant's resources, unless they provide some other benefit. One proposed reason for the sudden, fully developed appearance of flowers is that they evolved in an isolated setting like an island, or chain of islands, where the plants bearing them were able to develop a highly specialized relationship with some specific animal (a wasp, for example), the way many island species develop today. This symbiotic relationship, with a hypothetical wasp bearing pollen from one plant to another much the way [[fig wasp]]s do today, could have eventually resulted in both the plant(s) and their partners developing a high degree of specialization. [[Island genetics]] is believed to be a common source of [[speciation]], especially when it comes to radical adaptations which seem to have required inferior transitional forms. Note that the wasp example is not incidental; bees, apparently evolved specifically for symbiotic plant relationships, are descended from wasps.

Likewise, most [[fruit]] used in plant reproduction comes from the enlargement of parts of the flower. This fruit is frequently a tool which depends upon animals wishing to eat it, and thus scattering the seeds it contains.

While many such [[symbiotic relationship]]s remain too fragile to survive competition with mainland organisms, flowers proved to be an unusually effective means of production, spreading (whatever their actual origin) to become the dominant form of land plant life.

Flower evolution continues to the present day; modern flowers have been so profoundly influenced by humans that many of them cannot be pollinated in nature. Many modern, domesticated flowers used to be simple weeds, which only sprouted when the ground was disturbed. Some of them tended to grow with human crops, and the prettiest did not get plucked because of their beauty, developing a dependence upon and special adaptation to human affection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516094446/http://www.livescience.com/othernews/050526_flower_power.html|archivedate=2008-05-16 |url=http://www.livescience.com/othernews/050526_flower_power.html |title=Human Affection Altered Evolution of Flowers |publisher=Livescience.com |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spectrum_of_Flowers(Rosa)_en.pdf|thumb|Reflectance spectra for the flowers of several varieties of [[rose]]. A red rose absorbs about 99.7% of light across a broad area below the red wavelengths of the spectrum, leading to an exceptionally ''pure'' red. A yellow rose will reflect about 5% of blue light, producing an unsaturated yellow (a yellow with a degree of white in it).]]
Many flowering plants reflect as much light as possible within the range of visible wavelengths of the pollinator the plant intends to attract. Flowers that reflect the full range of visible light are generally perceived as ''[[white]]'' by a human observer. An important feature of white flowers is that they reflect equally across the visible spectrum. While many flowering plants use white to attract pollinators, the use of color is also widespread (even within the same species). Color allows a flowering plant to be more specific about the pollinator it seeks to attract. The color model used by human color reproduction technology ([[CMYK color model|CMYK]]) relies on the modulation of pigments that divide the spectrum into broad areas of absorption. Flowering plants by contrast are able to shift the transition point wavelength between absorption and reflection. If it is assumed that the visual systems of most pollinators view the visible spectrum as [[Color wheel|circular]] then it may be said that flowering plants produce color by absorbing the light in one region of the spectrum and reflecting the light in the other region. With CMYK, color is produced as a function of the amplitude of the broad regions of absorption. Flowering plants by contrast produce color by modifying the frequency (or rather wavelength) of the light reflected. Most flowers absorb light in the blue to yellow region of the spectrum and reflect light from the green to red region of the spectrum. For many species of flowering plant, it is the transition point that characterizes the color that they produce. Color may be modulated by shifting the transition point between absorption and reflection and in this way a flowering plant may specify which pollinator it seeks to attract.
Some flowering plants also have a limited ability to modulate areas of absorption. This is typically not as precise as control over wavelength. Humans observers will perceive this as degrees of saturation (the amount of ''white'' in the color).

Many flowers have important [[symbol]]ic meanings in Western culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jenkins|first1=Zack|title=9 Thoughts People Really Think When Receiving Flowers|url=https://www.thebouqs.com/blog/9-thoughts-people-really-think-when-receiving-flowers-2/|website=The Bouqs Company|accessdate=22 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120024/https://www.thebouqs.com/blog/9-thoughts-people-really-think-when-receiving-flowers-2/|archivedate=26 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of assigning meanings to flowers is known as [[floriography]]. Some of the more common examples include:
* Red [[rose]]s are given as a symbol of love, beauty, and passion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Audet|first1=Marye|title=Roses and Their Meaning|url=http://garden.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Roses_and_Their_Meaning|accessdate=22 August 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826114033/http://garden.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Roses_and_Their_Meaning|archivedate=26 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Poppy (flower)|Poppies]] are a symbol of consolation in time of death. In the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia and Canada, red poppies are worn to commemorate soldiers who have died in times of war.
* [[Iris (plant)|Irises]]/[[Lily]] are used in burials as a symbol referring to "resurrection/life". It is also associated with stars (sun) and its petals blooming/shining.
* [[Asteraceae|Daisies]] are a symbol of innocence.

[[File:Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder (Dutch - Flower Still Life - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Flowers are common subjects of [[still life]] paintings, such as this one by [[Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder]]]]
Because of their varied and colorful appearance, flowers have long been a favorite subject of visual artists as well.  Some of the most celebrated paintings from well-known painters are of flowers, such as [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]]'s [[sunflowers (series of paintings)|sunflowers]] series or [[Claude Monet|Monet]]'s water lilies.  Flowers are also dried, freeze dried and pressed in order to create permanent, three-dimensional pieces of [[flower art]].

Flowers within art are also representative of the [[female genitalia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frownfelter|first1=Andrea|title=Flower Symbolism as Female Sexual Metaphor|url=http://commons.emich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1210&amp;context=honors|publisher=Eastern Michigan University|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810175632/http://commons.emich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1210&amp;context=honors|archivedate=2014-08-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in the works of artists such as [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Imogen Cunningham]], [[Veronica Ruiz de Velasco]], and [[Judy Chicago]], and in fact in Asian and western classical art. Many cultures around the world have a marked tendency to associate flowers with [[female|femininity]].

The great variety of delicate and beautiful flowers has inspired the works of numerous poets, especially from the 18th–19th century [[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] era. Famous examples include [[William Wordsworth]]'s ''[[I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud]]'' and [[William Blake]]'s ''[[Ah! Sun-Flower]]''.

Their symbolism in dreams has also been discussed, with possible interpretations including "blossoming potential".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Dee |first= Nerys |title= Your Dreams &amp; What They Mean |year= 1984 |publisher= Guild Publishing |location= Surrey, Great Britain |page= 142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman goddess of flowers, gardens, and the season of Spring is [[Flora (goddess)|Flora]]. The Greek goddess of spring, flowers and nature is [[Chloris]].

In [[Hindu]] mythology, flowers have a significant status. Vishnu, one of the three major gods in the Hindu system, is often depicted standing straight on a [[lotus (plant)|lotus]] flower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/deities/vishnu.shtml |title=Vishnu |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2009-08-24 |accessdate=2010-08-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028091134/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/deities/vishnu.shtml |archivedate=2010-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the association with Vishnu, the Hindu tradition also considers the lotus to have spiritual significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/1999/7/1999-7-13.shtml |title=God's Favorite Flower |publisher=Hinduism Today |accessdate=2010-08-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413163953/http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/1999/7/1999-7-13.shtml |archivedate=2009-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it figures in the Hindu stories of creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sunrise/49-99-0/ge-mrook.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HaIfNjWU?url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sunrise/49-99-0/ge-mrook.htm |archivedate=2013-06-23 |title=The Lotus |publisher=Theosociety.org |accessdate=2010-08-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, people have sought ways to cultivate, buy, wear, or otherwise be around flowers and blooming plants, partly because of their agreeable appearance and [[odor|smell]]. Around the world, people use flowers to mark important events in their lives:

* For new births or [[infant baptism|christenings]]
* As a [[corsage]] or [[boutonniere]] worn at social functions or for holidays
* As tokens of love or esteem
* For wedding flowers for the bridal party, and for decorations for the hall
* As brightening decorations within the home
* As a gift of remembrance for ''bon voyage'' parties, welcome-home parties, and "thinking of you" gifts
* For [[funeral]] flowers and expressions of [[sympathy]] for the grieving
* For worship. In [[Hindu]] culture adherents commonly bring flowers as a gift to [[temple]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=VISITING A HINDU TEMPLE; A BEGINNER'S GUIDE |url=https://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=818 |publisher=[[Hinduism Today]] |date=April 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aikya Linga in Varanasi.jpg|thumb|upright|A woman spreading flowers over a [[lingam]] in a temple in [[Varanasi]]]]

People therefore grow flowers around their homes, dedicate parts of their living space to [[flower garden]]s, pick wildflowers, or buy [[Horticulture industry|commercially-grown]] flowers from [[florist]]s.

Flowers provide less food than other major plant parts ([[seed]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[root]]s, [[plant stem|stems]] and  [[leaf|leaves]]), but still provide several important [[vegetable]]s and [[spice]]s. Flower vegetables include [[broccoli]], [[cauliflower]] and [[artichoke]]. The most expensive spice, [[saffron]], consists of dried stigmas of a [[crocus]]. Other flower spices are [[clove]]s and [[caper]]s. [[Hops]] flowers are used to flavor [[beer]]. [[Calendula|Marigold]] flowers are fed to [[chicken]]s to give their egg yolks a golden yellow color, which consumers find more desirable; dried and ground marigold flowers are also used as a spice and colouring agent in [[Georgian cuisine]]. Flowers of the [[dandelion]] and [[Sambucus|elder]] are often made into wine. Bee [[pollen]], pollen collected from bees, is considered a health food by some people. [[Honey]] consists of bee-processed flower nectar and is often named for the type of flower, e.g. [[orange (fruit)|orange]] blossom honey, [[clover]] honey and [[tupelo]] honey.

[[list of edible flowers|Hundreds of fresh flowers are edible]], but only few are widely marketed as food. They are often added to [[salad]]s as [[garnish (food)|garnish]]es. [[Squash blossom]]s are dipped in breadcrumbs and fried. Some [[edible flower]]s include [[nasturtium (common name)|nasturtium]], [[chrysanthemum]], [[carnation]], [[cattail]], [[Japanese honeysuckle]], [[chicory]], [[cornflower]], [[Canna (plant)|canna]], and [[sunflower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wood |first1=Zoe |title=Blooming tasty – edible flowers are summer's hottest food trend |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/30/blooming-tasty-edible-flowers-are-summers-hottest-food-trend |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edible flowers such as [[Asteraceae|daisy]], [[rose]], and [[viola (plant)|violet]] are sometimes candied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bradley |first1=Sue |title=How to crystallise flowers like the Victorians |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/gardenprojects/11590050/How-to-crystallise-flowers-like-the-Victorians.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flowers such as chrysanthemum, rose, jasmine, Japanese honeysuckle, and chamomile, chosen for their fragrance and medicinal properties, are used as [[tisane]]s, either mixed with [[camellia sinensis|tea]] or on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wong |first1=James |title=Grow your own herbal teas |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/07/grow-your-own-herbal-teas |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flowers have been used since prehistoric times in funeral rituals: traces of pollen have been found on a woman's tomb in the [[El Miron Cave]] in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stone Age mourners 'placed flowers on graves' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/11596312/Stone-Age-mourners-placed-flowers-on-graves.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cultures draw a connection between flowers and life and death, and because of their seasonal return flowers also suggest rebirth, which may explain why many people place flowers upon graves. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], as recorded in [[Euripides]]'s play ''[[The Phoenician Women]]'',  placed a crown of flowers on the head of the deceased;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Burial Rites |url=http://www.hellenicaworld.com/Greece/Ancient/en/BurialRites.html |publisher=Hellenica World |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; they also covered tombs with wreaths and flower petals. Flowers were widely used in [[ancient Egypt]]ian burials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hays|first=Christopher B.|title=Death in the Iron Age II and in First Isaiah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IcpdmHW87EAC&amp;pg=PA302|year=2011|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3-16-150785-4|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mexico|Mexicans]] to this day use flowers prominently in their [[Day of the Dead]] celebrations&lt;ref name=Latina-p72&gt;{{cite book | first=Frances Ann | last=Day | title=Latina and Latino Voices in Literature | publisher=Greenwood | year=2003 | page=72 | isbn=978-0313323942}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the same way that their [[Aztec]] ancestors did.

'''Foldit''' is an [[online]] [[puzzle video game]] about [[protein folding]]. It is part of an experimental research project developed by the [[University of Washington]], Center for Game Science, in collaboration with the UW Department of [[Biochemistry]]. The objective of Foldit is to fold the structures of selected [[protein]]s as perfectly as possible, using tools provided in the game. The [[Score (game)#High score|highest scoring]] solutions are analyzed by researchers, who determine whether or not there is a native structural configuration ([[native state]]) that can be applied to relevant proteins in the real world. Scientists can then use these solutions to target and eradicate [[disease]]s and create biological innovations.
A 2010 paper in the science journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' credited Foldit's 57,000 players with providing useful results that matched or outperformed algorithmically computed solutions.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news |title=In a Video Game, Tackling the Complexities of Protein Folding |author=John Markoff |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/science/05protein.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=10 August 2010 |accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/nature09304| pmid=20686574|pmc = 2956414| title=Predicting protein structures with a multiplayer online game| journal=Nature| volume=466| issue=7307| pages=756–760| year=2010| last1=Cooper| first1=Seth| last2=Khatib| first2=Firas| last3=Treuille| first3=Adrien| last4=Barbero| first4=Janos| last5=Lee| first5=Jeehyung| last6=Beenen| first6=Michael| last7=Leaver-Fay| first7=Andrew| last8=Baker| first8=David| last9=Popović| first9=Zoran| last10=Players| first10=Foldit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Rosetta ===
Prof. [[David Baker (biochemist)|David Baker]], a protein research scientist at the University of Washington, founded the Foldit project. Seth Cooper was the lead game designer. Before starting the project, Baker and his laboratory coworkers relied on another research project named Rosetta&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rosettacommons.org |title=Rosetta Commons: The hub for Rosetta modeling software |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=&lt;!--Website displays present year.--&gt; |website=RosettaCommons.org |publisher=RosettaCommons.org |access-date=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to predict the native structures of various proteins using special computer [[protein structure prediction]] [[algorithm]]s. Rosetta was eventually extended to use the power of [[distributed computing]]: The [[Rosetta@home]] program was made available for public [[download]], and displayed its protein-folding progress as a [[screensaver]]. Its results were sent to a central [[Server (computing)|server]] for verification.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-08/hhmi-pgt080310.php "Protein-folding game taps power of worldwide audience to solve difficult puzzles"] [[Eurekalert!]], August 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Rosetta@home users became frustrated when they saw ways to solve [[protein structure]]s, but could not interact with the program. Hoping that humans could improve the computers' attempts to solve protein structures, Baker approached David Salesin and Zoran Popović, computer science professors at the same university, to help conceptualize and build an interactive program, a [[video game]], that would appeal to the public and help efforts to find native protein structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bourzac |first=Katherine |date=2008-05-08 |title=Biologists Enlist Online Gamers |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/410098/biologists-enlist-online-gamers/ |newspaper=[[Technology Review]] |location= |access-date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bohannon |first=John |date=2009-04-20 |title=Gamers Unravel the Secret Life of Protein |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/04/ff-protein |newspaper=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |location= |access-date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~zoran/|title=Zoran Popović|work=washington.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foldit ===
Many of the same people who created Rosetta@home worked on Foldit. The public [[software release life cycle|beta]] version was released in May 2008&lt;ref&gt;Hickey, Hannah. [http://www.washington.edu/news/archive/id/41558 "Computer game's high score could earn the Nobel Prize in medicine"] [[University of Washington]], May 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and has 240,000 registered players.&lt;ref name=games&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=victory-for-crowdsourced-biomolecule2&amp;page=2|title=Online Gamers Achieve First Crowd-Sourced Redesign of Protein|author=Marshall, Jessica|publisher=[[Scientific America]]|date=January 22, 2012|accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, Foldit has participated in Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction ([[CASP]]) experiments, submitting its best solutions to targets based on unknown protein structures. CASP is an international program to assess methods of protein structure prediction and identify those that are most productive.&lt;!--citation required--&gt;

== Goals ==
&lt;!--citation needed in this section--&gt;
Protein structure prediction is important in several fields of science, including [[bioinformatics]], [[molecular biology]], and [[medicine]]. Identifying natural proteins' structural configurations enables scientists to understand them better. This can lead to creating novel [[protein design|proteins by design]], advances in treating disease, and solutions for other real-world problems such as [[invasive species]], [[waste]], and [[pollution]].

The process by which living beings create the primary structure of proteins, [[protein biosynthesis]], is reasonably well understood, as is the means by which proteins are [[DNA sequencing|encoded as DNA]]. However, determining how a given protein's primary structure becomes a functioning three-dimensional structure, how the [[molecule]] ''folds'', is more difficult. The general process is understood, but predicting a protein's eventual, functioning structure is [[computation]]ally demanding.

== Methods ==
Similarly to Rosetta@home, Foldit is a means to discover native protein structures faster through distributed computing. However, Foldit has a greater emphasis on community collaboration through its forums, where users can collaborate on certain folds.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Furthermore, Foldit's crowdsourced approach places a greater emphasis on the user.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Foldit's virtual interaction and gamification create a unique and innovative environment with the potential to greatly advance protein folding research.
&lt;!--===Crowdsourcing===--&gt;
&lt;!--===Distributed Computing===--&gt;

=== Virtual interaction ===
Foldit attempts to apply the [[human brain]]'s three-dimensional [[pattern matching]] and [[spatial reasoning]] abilities to help solve the problem of protein structure prediction. Current puzzles are based on well-understood proteins. By analysing how humans intuitively approach these puzzles, researchers hope to improve the algorithms used by protein-folding software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horowitz|first=Scott|last2=Koepnick|first2=Brian|last3=Martin|first3=Raoul|last4=Tymieniecki|first4=Agnes|last5=Winburn|first5=Amanda A.|last6=Cooper|first6=Seth|last7=Flatten|first7=Jeff|last8=Rogawski|first8=David S.|last9=Koropatkin|first9=Nicole M.|date=2016-09-16|year=|title=Determining crystal structures through crowdsourcing and coursework|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ncomms12549|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=7|pages=|doi=10.1038/ncomms12549|issn=2041-1723|pmc=5028414|pmid=27633552|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foldit includes a series of [[tutorial]]s where users manipulate simple protein-like structures and a periodically updated set of puzzles based on real proteins. It shows a graphical representation of each protein which users can manipulate using a set of tools.

=== Gamification ===
&lt;!--citation needed in this section--&gt;
Foldit's developers wanted to attract as many people as possible to the cause of protein folding. So, rather than only building a useful science tool, they used [[gamification]] (the inclusion of gaming elements) to make Foldit appealing and engaging to the general public.

As a protein structure is modified, a ''score'' is calculated based on how well-folded the protein is, and a list of high scores for each puzzle is maintained. Foldit users may create and join groups, and share puzzle solutions. A separate list of group high scores is maintained.

== Accomplishments ==

*In 2011, Foldit players helped decipher the [[crystal structure]] of the [[Simian retrovirus#History|Mason-Pfizer monkey virus]] (M-PMV) [[retrovirus|retroviral]] [[protease]], a monkey [[virus]] which causes ''human immunodeficiency virus'' infection and ''acquired immune deficiency syndrome'' ([[HIV/AIDS]]), a scientific problem that had been unsolved for 15 years. While the puzzle was available for three weeks, players produced an accurate [[3D computer graphics|3D]] model of the [[enzyme]] in only ten days.&lt;ref name="2011paper"&gt;{{Cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25563">A '''function model''' or ''functional model'' in [[systems engineering]] and [[software engineering]] is a structured [[Representation (systemics)|representation]] of the [[Function (engineering)|functions]] ([[Activity diagram|activities]], [[Task analysis|actions]], [[wikt:process|process]]es, [[Operations management|operation]]s) within the modeled [[system]] or subject area.&lt;ref name= "ITL93"&gt;[http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/idef02.doc FIPS Publication 183] released of IDEFØ December 1993 by the Computer Systems Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:IDEF Diagram Example.jpg|thumb|360px|Example of a function model of the process of "Maintain Reparable Spares" in [[IDEF0]] notation.]]

A function model, similar with the [[activity diagram|activity model]] or [[process model]], is a graphical representation of an [[Business|enterprise]]'s function within a defined scope. The purposes of the function model are to describe the functions and processes, assist with discovery of information needs, help identify opportunities, and establish a basis for determining product and service costs.&lt;ref name="rmsc-1995"&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/era/pdf/rmsc-19951006-dod-rm-function-and-information-models.pdf Reader's Guide to IDEF0 Function Models]. Accessed 27 Nov 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The function model in the field of systems engineering and software engineering originates in the 1950s and 1960s, but the origin of functional modelling of organizational activity goes back to the late 19th century. 

In the late 19th century the first diagrams appeared that pictured business activities, actions, processes, or operations, and in the first half of the 20th century the first structured methods for documenting business process activities emerged. One of those methods was the [[flow process chart]], introduced by [[Frank Gilbreth]] to members of [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME) in 1921 with the presentation, entitled “Process Charts—First Steps in Finding the One Best Way”.&lt;ref name="BBG02"&gt;Ben B. Graham (2002). ''Detail Process Charting''. p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbreth's tools quickly found their way into [[industrial engineering]] curricula. 

The emergence of the field of ''systems engineering'' can be traced back to [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first to define the function model in this field was the British engineer [[William Gosling (engineer)|William Gosling]]. In his book ''The design of engineering systems'' (1962, p. 25) he stated:  
:''A functional model must thus achieve two aims in order to be of use. It must furnish a throughput description mechanics capable of completely defining the first and last throughput states, and perhaps some of the intervening states. It must also offer some means by which any input, correctly described in terms of this mechanics, can be used to generate an output which is an equally correct description of the output which the actual system would have given for the input concerned. It may also be noted that there are two other things which a functional model may do, but which are not necessary to all functional models. Thus such a system may, but need not, describe the system throughputs other than at the input and output, and it may also contain a description of the operation which each element carries out on the throughput, but once again this is not.''&lt;ref&gt;[[William Gosling (engineer)|William Gosling]] (1962) ''The design of engineering systems''. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first well defined function models, was the [[Functional Flow Block Diagram]] (FFBD) developed by the defense-related [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] Incorporated in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Weilkiens (2008). ''Systems Engineering with SysML/UML: Modeling, Analysis, Design''. Page 287.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s it was exploited by the [[NASA]] to visualize the time sequence of events in a space systems and flight missions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Chestnut]] (1967). ''Systems Engineering Methods''. Page 254.&lt;/ref&gt; It is further widely used in classical [[systems engineering]] to show the order of execution of system functions.&lt;ref name="TD03"&gt;Thomas Dufresne &amp; James Martin (2003). [http://mason.gmu.edu/~tdufresn/paper.doc "Process Modeling for E-Business"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220024049/http://mason.gmu.edu/~tdufresn/paper.doc |date=December 20, 2006 }}.

== Functional modeling topics ==

=== Functional perspective ===
In [[systems engineering]] and [[software engineering]] a function model is created with a functional [[Modeling perspectives|modeling perspective]]. The functional perspective is one of the perspectives possible in [[business process modelling]], other perspectives are for example behavioural, organisational or informational.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.jyu.fi/~jpt/ME2000/Me14/sld004.htm Process perspectives]. In: ''Metamodeling and method engineering'', Minna Koskinen, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

A functional modeling perspective concentrates on describing the [[dynamic system|dynamic process]]. The main concept in this modeling perspective is the process, this could be a function, transformation, activity, action, task etc. A well-known example of a modeling language employing this perspective is [[data flow diagram]]s.

The perspective uses four symbols to describe a process, these being:
*Process: Illustrates transformation from input to output.
*Store:	   Data-collection or some sort of material.
*Flow:	   Movement of data or material in the process.
*External Entity: External to the modeled system, but interacts with it.
Now, with these symbols, a process can be represented as a network of these symbols. This decomposed process is a DFD, data flow diagram.

[[File:Fo2ufg823rhf832hfdorfg.JPG|thumb|Example of functional decomposition in a systems analysis.]]In [[Dynamic Enterprise Modeling]] a division is made in the [[Control model]], Function Model, [[Process model]] and [[Organizational model]].

=== Functional decomposition ===
[[Functional decomposition]] refers broadly to the process of resolving a [[Function (mathematics)|functional]] relationship into its constituent parts in such a way that the original function can be reconstructed from those parts by [[function composition]]. In general, this process of decomposition is undertaken either for the purpose of gaining insight into the identity of the constituent components, or for the purpose of obtaining a compressed representation of the global function, a task which is feasible only when the constituent processes possess a certain level of ''modularity''. 

[[Decomposition (computer science)|Functional decomposition]] has a prominent role in [[computer programming]], where a major goal is to ''modularize'' processes to the greatest extent possible. For example, a library management system may be broken up into an inventory module, a patron information module, and a fee assessment module. In the early decades of computer programming, this was manifested as the "art of subroutining," as it was called by some prominent practitioners.

Functional decomposition of engineering systems is a method for analyzing engineered systems. The basic idea is to try to divide a system in such a way that each block of the block diagram can be described without an "and" or "or" in the description.

This exercise forces each part of the system to have a pure [[role|function]]. When a system is composed of pure functions, they can be reused, or replaced. A usual side effect is that the interfaces between blocks become simple and generic. Since the interfaces usually become simple, it is easier to replace a pure function with a related, similar function.

== Functional modeling methods ==
The functional approach is extended in multiple diagrammic techniques and modeling notations. This section gives an overview of the important techniques in chronological order.

=== Function block diagram ===
[[Image:Functional_block_diagram_of_the_attitude_control_and_maneuvering_electronics_system.jpg|thumb|320px|Functional block diagram of the attitude control and maneuvering electronics system of the [[Project_Gemini#Spacecraft|Gemini spacecraft]]. June 1962.]]
A [[functional block diagram]] is a [[block diagram]], that describes the functions and interrelationships of a [[system]]. The functional block diagram can picture:&lt;ref&gt;James Perozzo (1994) ''The complete guide to electronics troubleshooting''. p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

* Functions of a system pictured by blocks  
* Input and output elements of a block pictured with lines, and 
* Relationships between the functions 
* Functional sequences and paths for matter and or signals&lt;ref&gt;William H. Von Alven (1964) ''Reliability engineering'' explains: "Functional block diagrams show functional sequences and signal paths, and items which are wired in parallel are drawn in parallel" (p. 286)&lt;/ref&gt;
The block diagram can use additional schematic symbols to show particular properties.

Specific function block diagram are the classic [[Functional Flow Block Diagram]], and the [[Function Block Diagram]] (FBD) used in the design of [[programmable logic controller]]s.

=== Functional Flow Block Diagram ===
[[File:Functional Flow Block Diagram Format.jpg|thumb|320px|[[Functional Flow Block Diagram]] Format.&lt;ref name="SEF01"&gt;[http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf ''Systems Engineering Fundamentals.''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203501/http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf |date=September 27, 2007 }} Defense Acquisition University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Functional flow block diagram]] (FFBD) is a multi-tier, time-sequenced, step-by-step [[flow diagram]] of the [[system]]’s functional flow.&lt;ref name="faa.gov"&gt;The first version of this article is completely based on the [http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/operations/sysengsaf/seman/SEM3.1/Section%204.4.pdf NAS SYSTEM ENGINEERING MANUAL SECTION] 4.4 VERSION 3.1 06/06/06.&lt;/ref&gt;
The diagram is developed in the 1950s and widely used in classical [[systems engineering]]. The Functional Flow Block Diagram is also referred to as ''Functional Flow Diagram'', ''functional block diagram'', and ''functional flow''.&lt;ref name="FAA08"&gt;[http://www.hf.faa.gov/webtraining/Usability/u17_tools2.htm Task Analysis Tools Used Throughout Development]. FAA 2008. Retrieved 25 Sept 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional Flow Block Diagrams (FFBD) usually define the detailed, step-by-step operational and support sequences for [[system]]s, but they are also used effectively to define [[wikt:process|process]]es in developing and producing systems. The [[software development process]]es also use FFBDs extensively. In the system context, the functional flow steps may include combinations of [[computer hardware|hardware]], [[software]], [[personnel]], facilities, and/or procedures. 

In the FFBD method, the functions are organized and depicted by their logical order of execution. Each function is shown with respect to its logical relationship to the execution and completion of other functions. A node labeled with the function name depicts each function. Arrows from left to right show the order of execution of the functions. Logic symbols represent sequential or parallel execution of functions.&lt;ref name="FAA06"&gt;FAA (2006). [http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/operations/sysengsaf/seman/SEM3.1/Section%204.4.pdf NAS SYSTEM ENGINEERING MANUAL SECTION] 4.4 VERSION 3.1 06/06/06.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HIPO and oPO ===
[[File:IPO-S Model.gif|thumb|180px|left|An expanded [[IPO Model]].]]
[[HIPO]] for ''hierarchical input process output'' is a popular 1970s [[systems analysis]] design aid and documentation technique&lt;ref&gt;IBM Corporation (1974).''HIPO—A Design Aid and Documentation Technique'', Publication Number GC20-1851, IBM Corporation, White Plains, NY, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; for representing the modules of a [[system]] as a [[hierarchy]] and for documenting each module.&lt;ref name="Sandia92"&gt;Sandia National Laboratories (1992). [http://www.prod.sandia.gov/cgi-bin/techlib/access-control.pl/1985/852348.pdf Sandia Software Guidelines Volume 5 Tools, Techniques,and Methodologies] SANDIA REPORTS 85–2348qUC–32&lt;/ref&gt;  

It was used to develop requirements, construct the design, and support implementation of an expert system to demonstrate automated rendezvous. Verification was then conducted systematically because of the method of design and implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ann Goodwin and Charles C. Robertson (1986). [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19880007850_1988007850.pdf EXPERT SYSTEM VERIFICATION CONCERNS IN AN OPERATIONS ENVIRONMENT]. NASA paper N88-17234.&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall design of the system is documented using HIPO charts or [[structure chart]]s. The structure chart is similar in appearance to an organizational chart, but has been modified to show additional detail. Structure charts can be used to display several types of information, but are used most commonly to diagram either [[data structure]]s or code structures.&lt;ref name="Sandia92"/&gt;

=== N2 Chart ===
[[File:N2 chart definition.JPG|thumb|240px|Figure 2. N2 chart definition.&lt;ref name="NASA95"/&gt;]]
The [[N2 Chart]] is a diagram in the shape of a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], representing functional or physical interfaces between system elements. It is used to systematically identify, define, tabulate, design, and analyze functional and physical interfaces. It applies to system [[interface (computing)|interface]]s and [[computer hardware|hardware]] and/or [[software]] interfaces.&lt;ref name="faa.gov"/&gt; 

The N2 diagram has been used extensively to develop data interfaces, primarily in the [[software]] areas. However, it can also be used to develop hardware interfaces. The basic N2 chart is shown in Figure 2. The system functions are placed on the diagonal; the remainder of the squares in the N x N matrix represent the interface inputs and outputs.

=== Structured Analysis and Design Technique ===
[[File:SADT.svg|thumb|180px|left|SADT basis element.]]
[[Structured Analysis and Design Technique]] (SADT) is a [[software engineering methodology]] for describing [[system]]s as a hierarchy of functions, a [[diagram]]matic notation for constructing a sketch for a software application. It offers building blocks to represent entities and activities, and a variety of arrows to relate boxes. These boxes and arrows have an associated informal [[semantics]].&lt;ref name ="JM04"&gt;[[John Mylopoulos]] (2004). [http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jm/2507S/Notes04/SADT.pdf Conceptual Modelling III. Structured Analysis and Design Technique (SADT)]. Retrieved 21 Sep 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; SADT can be used as a functional analysis tool of a given process, using successive levels of details. The SADT method allows to define user needs for IT developments, which is used in industrial Information Systems, but also to explain and to present an activity’s manufacturing processes, procedures.&lt;ref name="FL"&gt;[http://www.free-logistics.com/index.php/Download-document/22-SADT_eng.html SADT] at Free-logistics.com. Retrieved 21 Sep 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SADT supplies a specific functional view of any enterprise by describing the functions and their relationships in a company. These functions fulfill the objectives of a company, such as sales, order planning, product design, part manufacturing, and human resource management. The SADT can depict simple functional relationships and can reflect data and control flow relationships between different functions. The [[IDEF0]] formalism is based on SADT, developed by [[Douglas T. Ross]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Gavriel Salvendy (2001). ''Handbook of Industrial Engineering: Technology and Operations Management.''. p.508.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IDEF0 ===
[[File:IDEF Diagram Example.jpg|thumb|320px|[[IDEF0]] Diagram Example]]
[[IDEF0]] is a [[function modeling]] methodology for describing [[manufacturing]] functions, which offers a functional [[modeling language]] for the analysis, development, re-engineering, and integration of [[information system]]s; business processes; or software engineering analysis.&lt;ref name="DAC01"&gt;[http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf ''Systems Engineering Fundamentals.''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203501/http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf |date=September 27, 2007 }} Defense Acquisition University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the [[IDEF]] family of modeling languages in the field of [[software engineering]], and is built on the functional modeling language building [[Structured Analysis and Design Technique|SADT]].

The IDEF0 Functional Modeling method is designed to model the decisions, actions, and activities of an organization or system.&lt;ref name = "VG00"/&gt;  It was derived from the established graphic modeling language [[Structured Analysis and Design Technique]] (SADT) developed by [[Douglas T. Ross]] and [[SofTech, Inc.]]. In its original form, IDEF0 includes both a definition of a graphical modeling language ([[syntax]] and [[semantics]]) and a description of a comprehensive methodology for developing models.&lt;ref name= "ITL93"/&gt; The US Air Force commissioned the SADT developers to develop a function model method for analyzing and communicating the functional perspective of a system. IDEF0 should assist in organizing system analysis and promote effective communication between the analyst and the customer through simplified graphical devices.&lt;ref name = "VG00"&gt;[[Varun Grover]], [[William J. Kettinger]] (2000). ''Process Think: Winning Perspectives for Business Change in the Information Age. p.168.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Axiomatic Design ===
[[Axiomatic design]] is a top down hierarchical functional decomposition process used as a solution synthesis framework for the analysis, development, re-engineering, and integration of products, information systems, business processes or software engineering solutions.&lt;ref name="AD"&gt;Suh (2001). Axiomatic Design: Advances and Applications, Oxford University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-19-513466-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its structure is suited mathematically to analyze coupling between functions in order to optimize the architectural robustness of potential functional solution models.

== Related types of models ==
In the field of systems and software engineering numerous specific function and functional models and close related models have been defined. Here only a few general types will be explained.

=== Business function model ===
A ''Business Function Model'' (BFM) is a general description or category of operations performed routinely to carry out an organization's mission. They "provide a conceptual structure for the identification of general business functions".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Grefen (2010) ''Mastering e-Business''. p. 5-10&lt;/ref&gt; It can show the critical [[business process]]es in the context of the business area functions. The processes in the business function model must be consistent with the processes in the value chain models. Processes are a group of related business activities performed to produce an end product or to provide a service. Unlike business functions that are performed on a continual basis, processes are characterized by the fact that they have a specific beginning and an end point marked by the delivery of a desired output. The figure on the right depicts the relationship between the business processes, business functions, and the business area’s business reference model.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Interior (2000-08) ''Analyze the Business and Define the Target Business Environment''. Accessed 27 Nov 2008.&lt;!-- Now no longer online--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business Process Model and Notation ===
[[Image:BPMN-AProcesswithNormalFlow.svg|thumb|320px|[[Business Process Modeling Notation]] Example.]]
[[Business Process Model and Notation]] (BPMN) is a [[Information visualisation|graphical representation]] for specifying [[business process]]es in a [[workflow]]. BPMN was developed by [[Business Process Management Initiative]] (BPMI), and is currently maintained by the [[Object Management Group]] since the two organizations merged in 2005. The current version of BPMN is 2.0.&lt;ref name="bpmifaq"&gt;{{cite web|author= |title=BPMN Information|url=http://www.bpmn.org/Documents/FAQ.htm|accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) specification provides a graphical notation for specifying [[business process]]es in a [[Business Process Diagram]] (BPD).&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Simpson (2004). [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050202022_2005202152.pdf ''An XML Representation for Crew Procedures'']. Final Report NASA Faculty Fellowship Program - 2004. Johnson Space Center.&lt;/ref&gt;  The objective of BPMN is to support business process management for both technical users and business users by providing a notation that is intuitive to business users yet able to represent complex process semantics. The BPMN specification also provides a mapping between the graphics of the notation to the underlying constructs of execution languages, particularly [[BPEL4WS]].&lt;ref&gt;S.A. White, "Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN)," In: ''Business Process Management Initiative (BPMI)'' 3 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business reference model ===
[[Image:FEA BRM Hierachy.JPG|thumb|320px|This FEA [[Business reference model]] depicts the relationship between the business processes, business functions, and the business area’s business reference model.]]
A [[Business reference model]] is a reference model, concentrating on the functional and organizational aspects of the [[core business]] of an [[Business|enterprise]], [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service organization]] or [[government agency]]. In enterprise engineering a business reference model is part of an [[Enterprise Architecture Framework]] or ''Architecture Framework'', which defines how to organize the structure and [[view model|views]] associated with an [[Enterprise Architecture]].  

A [[reference model]] in general is a model of something that embodies the basic goal or idea of something and can then be looked at as a reference for various purposes. A business reference model is a means to describe the [[business operations]] of an organization, independent of the [[organizational structure]] that perform them. Other types of business reference model can also depict the relationship between the [[business process]]es, business functions, and the [[business area]]’s business reference model. These reference model can be constructed in layers, and offer a foundation for the analysis of service components, technology, data, and performance.

=== Operator function model ===
The ''Operator Function Model'' (OFM) is proposed as an alternative to traditional [[task analysis]] techniques used by [[human factors]] engineers. An operator function model attempts to represent in mathematical form how an operator might decompose a complex system into simpler parts and coordinate control actions and system configurations so that acceptable overall system performance is achieved. The model represents basic issues of knowledge representation, information flow, and decision making in complex systems. Miller (1985) suggests that the network structure can be thought of as a possible representation of an operator's [[Mental model|internal model]] of the system plus a control structure which specifies how the model is used to solve the decision problems that comprise operator control functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hf.faa.gov/workbenchtools/default.aspx?rPage=Tooldetails&amp;toolID=192 Operator Function Model (OFM)]. Accessed 27 Nov 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;

[[Gender]] has been an important theme explored in [[speculative fiction]]. The genres that make up speculative fiction (SF){{Ref label|Note1|a|a}}, [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], [[supernatural fiction]] [[horror fiction|horror]], [[superhero fiction]], [[science fantasy]] and related genres (utopian/dystopian literature), have always offered the opportunity for writers to explore social conventions, including gender, [[gender roles]], and beliefs about gender.  Like all literary forms, the science fiction genre reflects the popular perceptions of the eras in which individual creators were writing; and those creators' responses to gender stereotypes and gender roles.

Many writers have chosen to write with little or no questioning of gender roles, instead effectively reflecting their own cultural gender roles onto their fictional world.  However, many other writers have chosen to use science fiction and non-realistic formats in order to explore cultural conventions, particularly gender roles.  This article discusses works that have explored or expanded the treatment of gender in science fiction.

In addition to the traditional human genders, science fiction has extended the idea of gender to include transgender humans and hypothetical alien species and robots, and imagined trans-real genders, such as with aliens that are truly hermaphroditic or have a "third" gender, or robots that can change gender at will or are without gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ferrando | first = Francesca | year = 2015 | chapter = Of Posthuman Born: Gender, Utopia and the Posthuman | editor-last1 = Hauskeller | editor-first1 = M. | editor-last2 = Carbonell | editor-first2 = C. | editor-last3 = Philbeck | editor-first3 = T. | title =  Handbook on Posthumanism in Film and Television | location = London | publisher = Palgrave MacMillan | isbn = 978-1-137-43032-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical analysis==
Science fiction has been described as a useful tool for examining society attitudes to and conceptions of gender;&lt;ref name=DGinSF1&gt;Attebery, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; this is particularly true of literature, more so than for other media.&lt;ref name=DGinSF4/&gt; The conventions of speculative fiction genres encourage writers to explore the subject of biological sex and present alternative models for societies and characters with different beliefs about gender.&lt;ref name=DGinSF4&gt;Attebery, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Extrapolation of an initial speculative premise can as easily start from an idea about marriage customs or chromosomes as a technological change.&lt;ref name=DGinSF4/&gt; In spite of this potential, SF has been said to present only ideas about sex and gender that are fashionable or controversial in the present day, which it then projects into a future or fantasy setting.&lt;ref name=spreadmisand108/&gt;

Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre orientated toward a male readership,&lt;ref name=EoSF1088&gt;[[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]],''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'', "Sex" p. 1088, 2nd Ed., (1999), Orbit, Great Britain, {{ISBN|1-85723-897-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been described as being by men for men, or sometimes for boys.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]],''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'', [[Lisa Tuttle]], "Women as portrayed in Science Fiction" p. 1343, 2nd Ed., (1999), Orbit, Great Britain, {{ISBN|1-85723-897-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the stereotypical tropes of science fiction, such as [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]], [[robots]] or [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]] can be employed in such a way as to be metaphors for gender.&lt;ref name=DGinSF5&gt;Attebery, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantasy has been perceived as more accepting of women compared to science fiction or horror (and offering more roles than historical fiction or romance), yet seldom attempts to question or subvert the bias toward male superiority.&lt;ref name=EoF393&gt;[[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[John Grant (author)|John Grant]],''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Gender" p. 393, 1st Ed., (1997), Orbit, Great Britain, {{ISBN|1-85723-368-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science fiction's tendency to look to the future and imagine different societies gives it the potential to examine gender roles and preconceptions, whereas the use of archetypes and quasi-historical settings in fantasy has often included patriarchy.&lt;ref name=EoF393/&gt;

===Portrayal of women===
{{See also|Women in speculative fiction}}

The portrayal of women, or female-identified characters in the speculative genres, has varied widely throughout the genres' history. Some writers and artists have challenged their society's gender norms in producing their work; others have not. Among those who have challenged conventional understandings and portrayals of gender and sexuality, there have been of course significant variations. The common perception of the role of female-identified characters in SF works has long been dominated by one of two stereotypes: a woman who is evil ([[villainess]]) or one who is helpless ([[damsel in distress]]). These characters are usually physically attractive and provocatively dressed, often in [[Gender representation in video games#Women in scanty armor|scanty armor]],&lt;ref name="Adweek 4 June 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Griner|first=David|title=Will the Fantasy Genre Ever Grow Up and Ditch the Chainmail Bikini?

Viewers are seeing [[femininity]] in a new light as more female-identified Authors and fans come into the speculative fiction world. There have been female-identified characters in forms of strong woman warriors, or even as a main character who can think for herself.&lt;ref&gt;Hatcher, Melissa McCrory. “Finding Woman&amp;Apos;s Role in The Lord of the Rings.” Mythlore: A Journal of J. R. R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, Charles Williams, and Mythopoeic Literature, vol. 25, no. 3-4, 2007, pp. 43–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these gender rules being broken can be seen in many texts such as “[[The Lord of the Rings]]” by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and even “[[The Man in the High Castle]]” by [[Philip K. Dick]]. As more and more readers and fans of science fiction become female identified, the portrayal of female characters changes just as speculative fiction changes.&lt;ref&gt;Bainbridge, William. “Women in Science Fiction.” Sex Roles, vol. 8, no. 10, 1982, pp. 1081–1093.&lt;/ref&gt;


The first critical work focusing on women in SF was  ''Symposium: Women in Science Fiction''  (1975), edited by Jeffrey D. Smith,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Symposium: Women in Science Fiction|last= Smith|first= Jeffrey D.|authorlink= |year= 1975|publisher= Fantasmicon Press|location= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other influential works include ''Future Females:A Critical Anthology'' (1981) edited by [[Marleen S. Barr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Future Females: A Critical Anthology|last= Barr|first= Marleen S.|authorlink= |year= 1981|publisher= Bowling Green Popular Press|location= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/review_essays/freedman81.htm |title=Carl Freedman- Science Fiction and the Triumph of Feminism |publisher=Depauw.edu |accessdate=2009-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robots and cyborgs and the portrayal of women===
{{Main article|Android (robot)|Gynoid}}
A gynoid is a [[robot]] designed to look like a human female, as compared to an [[android (robot)|android]] modeled after a male (or genderless) human. Gynoids are "irresistibly linked" to men's lust, and are mainly designed as sex-objects, having no use beyond "pleasing men's violent sexual desires".&lt;ref&gt;Melzer, Patricia  ''Alien Constructions: Science Fiction and Feminist Thought'', p.204 University of Texas Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-292-71307-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A long tradition exists in fiction of men attempting to create the stereotypical "perfect woman".&lt;ref name="melzer202"&gt;Melzer, Patricia  ''Alien Constructions: Science Fiction and Feminist Thought'', p. 202 University of Texas Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-292-71307-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[Greek myth]] of [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]], and the female robot Maria in [[Fritz Lang]]'s [[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]. Female cyborgs have been similarly used in fiction, in which natural bodies are modified to become objects of fantasy.&lt;ref name="melzer202" /&gt; Fiction about gynoids or female cyborgs reinforce "essentialist ideas of feminity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=SciFi in the mind's eye: reading science through science fiction|last=Grebowicz|first=Margret|author2=L. Timmel Duchamp|author3=Nicola Griffith|author4=Terry Bisson|publisher=Open Court|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8126-9630-1|page=xviii|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portrayal of men===
Many male protagonists of science fiction are reflections of a single heroic archetype, often having scientific vocations or interests, and being  "cool, rational, competent", "remarkably sexless", interchangeable, and bland.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Annette (1990). ''Alien Zone: Cultural Theory and Contemporary Science Fiction Cinema''. Verso.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=annkuhn107&gt;Kuhn, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; [[Annette Kuhn]] posits that these asexual characters are attempts to gain independence from women and mother figures, and that this and their unfailing mechanical prowess is what gives them fans.&lt;ref name=annkuhn108&gt;Kuhn, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; The "super-male" and [[boy genius]] are also common stereotypes  frequently embodied by male characters.&lt;ref name=annkuhn25&gt;Kuhn, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=annkuhn28&gt;Kuhn, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics argue that much of science fiction fetishizes masculinity, and that incorporation of technology into science fiction provides a metaphor for imagined futuristic masculinity. Examples are the use of "hypermasculine cyborgs and console-cowboys". Such technologies are desirable as they reaffirm the readers' masculinity and protect against feminisation.&lt;ref name=SSF27p234&gt;The Fetishization of Masculinity in Science Fiction: The Cyborg and the Console Cowboy, Amanda Fernbach, ''Science Fiction Studies'', Vol. 27, No. 2 (Jul., 2000), p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; This fetishisation of masculinity via technology in science fiction differs from typical fetishisation in other genres, in which the fetishised object is always feminine.&lt;ref name=SSF27p234/&gt;

The book ''Spreading Misandry'' argues that science fiction is often used to make unfounded political claims about gender, and attempt to blame men for all of society's ills.&lt;ref name=spreadmisand108&gt;{{cite book |title= Spreading Misandry: The Teaching of Contempt for Men in Popular Culture|last= Nathanson|first= Paul |authorlink= |author2=Katherine K. Young|year= 2001|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press |page=108 |isbn=978-0-7735-2272-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Portrayal of transgender humans ===
{{Original research section|date=December 2017}}

While the ability to shift gender is common in Speculative and Science fiction, there is very little representation of trans identified human characters that are used as little more than a plot device for the author.  Male authors use the ability to change gender either speculate about medical technology or to act out an ideal of femininity.  Female authors use shifting gender to discuss the condition of being woman identified.  Both create trans-identified characters as caricatures of women, rather than full humans.  This is beginning to shift as more trans and queer identified authors are writing within the Sci-Fi/Speculative Fiction/Fantasy genres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cheryl-morgan.com/?page_id=9294|title=Changing Images of Trans People in Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature|date=2010-08-16|work=Cheryl's Mewsings|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=December 2017}}

===Single-gender worlds: utopias and dystopias===
{{Main article|Single-gender worlds}}
{{See also|Utopian and dystopian fiction}}
Single-gender worlds or single-sex societies have long been one of the primary ways to explore implications of gender and gender differences.&lt;ref name=DGinSF13/&gt; In speculative fiction, female-only worlds have been imagined to come about by the action of disease that wipes out men, along with the development of technological or mystical methods that allow female [[parthenogenic]] [[reproduction]]. The resulting society is often shown to be [[utopian]] by feminist writers. Many influential feminist utopias of this sort were written in the 1970s;&lt;ref name=DGinSF13&gt;Attebery, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=erotic1189&gt;Gaétan Brulotte &amp; John Phillips,''Encyclopedia of Erotic Literature', "Science Fiction and Fantasy", p.1189, CRC Press, 2006, {{ISBN|1-57958-441-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =utopfantast101/&gt; the most often studied examples include Joanna Russ's ''The Female Man'', [[Suzy McKee Charnas]]'s ''[[Walk to the End of the World]]'' and ''[[Motherlines]]'', and [[Marge Piercy]]'s ''[[Woman on the Edge of Time]]''.&lt;ref name=utopfantast101&gt;Bartter, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; Utopias imagined by male authors have generally included equality between sexes, rather than separation.&lt;ref name=utopfantast102/&gt;  Such worlds have been portrayed most often by lesbian or feminist authors; their use of female-only worlds allows the exploration of female independence and freedom from [[patriarchy]]. The societies may not necessarily be lesbian, or sexual at all—a famous early sexless example being ''[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]'' (1915) by [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]].&lt;ref name=erotic1189/&gt; Men-only societies are much less common; one example is Athos in ''[[Ethan of Athos]]'' (1986) by [[Lois McMaster Bujold]]. [[Joanna Russ]] suggests men-only societies are not commonly imagined, because men do not feel oppressed, and therefore imagining a world free of women does not imply an increase in freedom and is not as attractive.&lt;ref name=commungender329&gt;Romaine, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;

Utopias have been used to explore the ramification of gender being either a societal construct, or a hard-wired imperative.&lt;ref name=WSEncyc1442&gt;{{cite book |title= Women's studies encyclopedia|last= Tierney|first= Helen |authorlink= |year= 1999|publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|page=1442 |isbn=978-0-313-31073-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mary Gentle]]'s ''Golden Witchbreed'', gender is not chosen until maturity, and gender has no bearing on social roles. In contrast, [[Doris Lessing]]'s ''[[The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five]]'' (1980) suggests that men's and women's values are inherent to the sexes and cannot be changed, making a compromise between them essential. In ''My Own Utopia'' (1961) by [[Elizabeth Mann-Borgese]], gender exists but is dependent upon age rather than sex—genderless children mature into women, some of whom eventually become men.&lt;ref name=WSEncyc1442/&gt; Charlene Ball writes in ''Women's Studies Encyclopedia'' that use of speculative fiction to explore gender roles in future societies has been more common in the United States compared to Europe and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=WSEncyc1442/&gt;

Eric Leif Davin, for instance, documented almost 1,000 stories published in science fiction magazines by over 200 female-identified authors between 1926 and 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Leif Davin, ''Partners in Wonder: Women and the Birth of Science Fiction, 1926-1965''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proto SF===
In the early twentieth century, some women writers rebelled against the novels in which valiant men rescued weak women or fought against humourless, authoritarian female regimes.&lt;ref name=sevenglobal1/&gt; [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] wrote ''[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]'', an important early feminist utopia,&lt;ref name=WSEncyc1443&gt;{{cite book |title= Women's studies encyclopedia|last= Tierney|first= Helen |authorlink= |year= 1999|publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|page=1443 |isbn=978-0-313-31073-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Virginia Woolf]] wrote ''[[Orlando (novel)|Orlando]]''. Both Perkins and Woolf identified strongly with the [[first wave feminism]] of the period,and its call for equal rights and suffrage for women.&lt;ref name=sevenglobal1/&gt;

===The Pulp Era and the Golden Age (1920–1950s)===
SF portrayals of future societies remained broadly patriarchal, and female characters continued to be gender stereotyped and relegated to standardised roles that supported the male protagonists. Early feminist SF visions of all-women utopias were inverted by pulp writers to tell cautionary tales about the "sex war", in which brave men had to rescue society from joyless and dictatorial women, usually to the satisfaction of both sexes.&lt;ref name=sevenglobal1/&gt; [[John W. Campbell]]'s ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' was unusual in its covers not depicting men with ray guns and women with large breasts.&lt;ref name="pontin20081020"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Pontin |first=Mark Williams |date=November-December 2008 |title=The Alien Novelist |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/411039/the-alien-novelist/ |magazine=MIT Technology Review |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Knoles wrote in his 1960 ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' article on the era, "Girls of the Slime God", that&lt;ref name="knoles1960"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Girls for the Slime God |last=Knoles |first=William |publisher=Obscura Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-9659569-0-3 |editor-last=Resnick |editor-first=Mike |location=Ames, IA |language=English |orig-year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|A quivering bosom was no novel sight for a thirties s-f hero. Space Girls expressed most of their emotions through their pectoral muscle. Bosoms swayed, trembled, heaved, shivered, danced or pouted according to their owners' moods. In fact, if a hero in those days had been a little more observant and had carried a tape measure, he could have saved himself a lot of trouble. When he opened an air lock and a gorgeous stowaway fell out, uniform ripping, it usually took him five or six pages to find out whether she was a Venusian spy or not, whereas the reader knew at once. If her torn uniform revealed pouting young breasts, she was OK—probably someone's kid sister. If she had eager, straining breasts, she was the heroine. But a girl with proud, arrogant breasts was definitely a spy—while a ripe, full bosom meant she was a Pirate Queen and all hell would soon break loose.}}

[[Isaac Asimov]] disagreed, stating in 1969 that "until 1960 there was no branch of literature anywhere (except perhaps for the children's stories in Sunday school bulletins) as puritanical as science fiction", and that Knoles had to get his quotes from one "[[Marvel Science Stories|1938-39 magazine]]" which, Asimov said, published "spicy" stories for its "few readers" before "a deserved death".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/nightfallotherst00asim#page/306/mode/2up|title=Nightfall, and other stories|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|date=1969|publisher=Doubleday|pages=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Floyd C.

In the 1940s, post-WWII, female writers like Judith Merril and Leigh Brackett emerged, reclaiming female characters and carving out respect in their own right.&lt;ref name=sevenglobal1/&gt; [[C. L. Moore]] is an example of a woman successfully writing pulp speculative fiction tales under a genderless pen-name. Her story "No Woman Born" (1944),{{Ref label|Note1|b|b}} in which a female character's mind is transferred into a powerful robot body with feminine attributes is an early example of a work that challenged gender stereotypes of its day by combining femininity with power. Brian Attebery suggest that if the robot had appeared male, the gender would have been unremarkable or even invisible to readers, as masculine figures could be expected to be powerful.&lt;ref name=DGinSF5/&gt;

During the pulp era, unfavorable presentations of matriarchal societies, even [[dystopia]]s were common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Decoding Gender in Science Fiction|last=  Attebery|first= Brian|authorlink= Brian Attebery|page=13 |year= 2002|publisher= Routledge|location= |isbn=978-0-415-93950-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[John Wyndham]]'s ''[[Consider Her Ways]]'' (1956), for example, male rule is described as repressive to women, but freedom from patriarchy was achieved through an authoritarian female-only society modelled on [[ant]]s society.&lt;ref name=battle72&gt;Larbalestier,  "Mama Come Home; Parodies of the Sex-War" p.72&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1930s saw the beginnings of fantasy as a distinct publishing genre. Reacting against the hard, scientific, dehumanizing trends of contemporary science fiction, this new branch of SF drew on mythological and historical traditions and Romantic literature, including [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman]] mythologies, [[Norse sagas]], the ''[[Arabian Nights]]'' and Adventure stories such as [[Alexandre Dumas]]’ ''[[Three Musketeers]]''.&lt;ref name=sevenglobal1/&gt;  The conventions brought with them a tendency toward patriarchy and cast women in restrictive roles defined as early as in the plays of Euripides.  These roles included that of the "helper-maiden" or of "reproductive demon".&lt;ref name=sevenglobal1/&gt;

The 1930s also saw the advent of the [[sword and sorcery]] subgenre of pulp tales, which brought overt sexualisation to the representation of women in fantasy. Although physically more capable, female characters frequently continued to act as helpers to the male leads, but were now depicted as extremely attractive and very briefly clothed.  The first female lead character of a sword and sorcery story was [[Jirel of Joiry]], created by C. L. Moore and first appearing in "Black God's Kiss" (''[[Weird Tales]]'', volume 24, number 4, October 1934).

===New Wave (1960-1970s)===
Whereas the 1940s and 50s have been called the Golden Age of science fiction in general, the 1960s and 1970s are regarded as the most important and influential periods in the study of gender in speculative fiction.&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"/&gt;

This creative period saw the appearance of many influential novels by female authors, including [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' (1969), described as the book with which SF "lost its innocence on matters of sex and gender", and ''[[The Dispossessed]]'' (1974);&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"/&gt; [[Joanna Russ]]'s most important works, particularly ''[[The Female Man]]'' (1975), regarded by many as the central work of women's SF;&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"/&gt; and ''[[The Two of Them]]'' (1978); [[Anne McCaffrey]]'s prescient cyborg novel, ''[[The Ship Who Sang]]'' (1969);&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"/&gt;  [[Vonda McIntyre]]'s two most influential novels, ''[[The Exile Waiting]]'' (1975) and ''[[Dreamsnake]]'' (1978);&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"/&gt; [[Marge Piercy]]’s ''[[Woman on the Edge of Time]]'' (1976), the most important contribution to feminist sf by an author known mainly for realistic work;&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"/&gt; and several novels by [[Octavia Butler]], especially ''[[Kindred (novel)|Kindred]]'' (1979) and ''[[Wild Seed (novel)|Wild Seed]]'' (1980), which have been described as groundbreaking, and established an African-American female voice in SF.

Important short stories included many by [[James Tiptree Jr.]] (a male pseudonym used by Alice Sheldon),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Alien plots: female subjectivity and the divine in the light of James Tiptree's "A momentary taste of being"|last= Van der Spek|first= Inez |authorlink= |year= 2000|publisher=Liverpool University Press |pages=7–8 |isbn=978-0-85323-814-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance ''[[The Women Men Don't See]]'' (1973), ''[[The Girl Who Was Plugged In]]'' (1973), and ''[[The Screwfly Solution]]'' (1977).{{Ref label|Note1|c|c}}&lt;ref name=triumffeminism3&gt;Freedman&lt;/ref&gt;

These works coincided with the beginnings of application of feminist theory to SF,.&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"/&gt;  creating a self-consciously [[feminist science fiction]]. Feminist SF has been distinguished from earlier feminist utopian fiction by its greater attention to characterisation and inclusion of gender equality.&lt;ref name=utopfantast102&gt;Bartter, p.102&lt;/ref&gt;

Male writers also began to approach depiction of gender in new ways, with [[Samuel R. Delany]] establishing himself as the most radical voice among male SF figures for representations of alternative sexualities and gender-models in a series of major works, most importantly (with respect to gender), in ''[[Triton (novel)|Triton]]'' (1976).&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"/&gt; [[Gary Westfahl]] points out that "Heinlein is a problematic case for feminists; on the one hand, his works often feature strong female characters and vigorous statements that women are equal to or even superior to men; but these characters and statements often reflect hopelessly stereotypical attitudes about typical female attributes. It is disconcerting, for example, that in ''[[Expanded Universe (Heinlein)|Expanded Universe]]'' Heinlein calls for a society where all lawyers and politicians are women, essentially on the grounds that they possess a mysterious feminine practicality that men cannot duplicate." &lt;ref&gt;Gary Westfahl, 'Superladies in Waiting: How the Female Hero Almost Emerges in Science Fiction', ''Foundation'', vol. 58, 1993, pp. 42-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern SF (1980–2000s)===
By the 1980s the intersection of feminism and SF was already a major factor in the production of the literature itself.&lt;ref name=triumffeminism3/&gt;

Authors such as [[Nicola Griffith]] and [[Sheri S. Tepper]] frequently write on gender-related themes. Tepper's work has been described as "the definition of feminist science fiction", and her treatment of gender has varied from early optimistic science fantasies, in which women were equally as capable as men, to more pessimistic works, including ''[[The Gate to Women's Country]]'', in which men are the cause of war and pollution and true equality can only be achieved by transcending humanity altogether.&lt;ref name=utopfantast103--104&gt;Bartter, pp.103-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hugo Award|Hugo]], [[Nebula Award|Nebula]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke Award|Arthur C. Clarke award]] winning [[Ancillary Justice]] by [[Ann Leckie]] (2013) portrays a society where gender is an unimportant detail in people's lives. It refers to most characters as female, unless they're talking in a different language than the dominant one. This leaves the gender of most characters unclear. The reader, used to books that consistently use male pronouns, is constantly slightly on edge, because of the consistent use of 'she', 'her' etc.

The September 2017 anthology, [http://topsidepress.com/ Meanwhile, Elsewhere], is a collection of short stories written by trans-identified authors about trans-identified characters.  While these authors are well known to Queer audiences, they are new to Speculative, Sci-Fi and Fantasy readers. The anthology covers multiple genres, from [[Ryka Aoki]]'s "The Gift", in which the main character identifies as trans and everything is fine, to [[Jeanne Thornton]]'s "Angels Are Here To Help Us", which explores access to technology, money and privilege in relation to trans identity.  The book was edited by Cat Fitzpatrick and [[Casey Plett]] and was published by Topside Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://topsidepress.com/|title=The Post-Reality Expeditionist's Supply Store|website=The Post-Reality Expeditionist's Supply Store|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/meanwhile-elsewhere-book-review|title=“Meanwhile, Elsewhere” Envisions a New World for Trans Readers|work=Bitch Media|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a time when more girls read comics than boys,{{When|date=January 2014}} but these comics were generally [[realism (arts)|realist]], with a focus on romance and crime stories.&lt;ref name=Robbins7&gt;[[Trina Robbins|Robbins, Trina]]. ''From Girls to Grrrlz: A History of Women's Comics from Teens to Zines'' (San Francisco: Chronicle Books, 1999), p. 7; {{ISBN|0-7567-8120-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for most of their existence, comic books audiences have been assumed to be mostly male. The female characters and superheroes were targeted towards this male demographic, rather than towards women readers.&lt;ref name=CBnation250&gt;Wright, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; Although many female superheroes were created, very few starred in their own series or achieved stand-alone success. It has been debated whether the lack of female readership was due to male writers being uncomfortable with writing about or for women, or whether the comic book industry is male dominated due to the lack of intinsic interest of women in comics.&lt;ref name=CBnation250&gt;Wright, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known female superhero is writer-artist [[Fletcher Hanks]]'s minor character [[Fantomah]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/fantomah.htm Don Markstein's Toonopedia: Fantomah]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/66moryli6?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/fantomah.htm |date=2012-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an ageless, [[ancient Egypt]]ian woman in the modern day who could transform into a skull-faced creature with superpowers to fight evil; she debuted in 1940 in [[Fiction House]]s ''Jungle Comics''.

In the early 1940s the DC line was dominated by superpowered male characters such as the [[Green Lantern]], [[Batman]], and its flagship character, [[Superman]]. The first widely recognizable female superhero is [[Wonder Woman]], created by [[William Moulton Marston]] for [[All-American Publications]], one of three companies that would merge to form [[DC Comics]].&lt;ref name="Who Was Wonder Woman"&gt;'[http://www.bu.edu/alumni/bostonia/2001/fall/wonderwoman/ Who Was Wonder Woman?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104060542/http://www.bu.edu/alumni/bostonia/2001/fall/wonderwoman/ |date=January 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marston intended the character to be a strong female role-model for girls,  with "all the strength of Superman plus all the allure of a good and beautiful woman."&lt;ref&gt;Les Daniels, ''Wonder Woman: The Complete History,'' (DC Comics, 2000), pp.  28-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and television==

===Film===
[[File:PlanNine 07.jpg|thumb|[[Maila Nurmi]] as Vampira in ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'']]
Female characters in early science fiction films such as [[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]] (1968) were often portrayed as simple sex kittens.&lt;ref name=toughgirls102&gt;{{cite book |title= Tough girls: women warriors and wonder women in popular culture|last= Inness|first= Sherrie A. |authorlink= |year= 1998|publisher= Published by University of Pennsylvania Press|page= 102|isbn=978-0-8122-3466-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Sherrie Inness has said that the portrayals of tough women in later science fiction embody women's fantasies of empowerment,&lt;ref name=toughgirls23&gt;{{cite book |title= Tough girls: women warriors and wonder women in popular culture|last= Inness|first= Sherrie A. |authorlink= |year= 1998|publisher= Published by University of Pennsylvania Press|page= 23|isbn=978-0-8122-3466-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the characters of Sharrow in the [[Iain M. Banks]]' novel ''[[Against a Dark Background]]'' (1993) or Alex in the film ''[[Nemesis 2: Nebula|Nemesis 2]]'', who both physically overpower male attackers.&lt;ref name=toughgirls23/&gt;&lt;ref name=toughgirls25&gt;{{cite book |title= Tough girls: women warriors and wonder women in popular culture|last= Inness|first= Sherrie A. |authorlink= |year= 1998|publisher= Published by University of Pennsylvania Press|page= 25|isbn=978-0-8122-3466-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
Early television depicted women primarily as idealized "perfect housewives" or (often [[black (race)|black]]) domestic workers.&lt;ref name=fantgirls1&gt;Helford, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1960s and 1970s, cultural mores had relaxed, and sexual objectification of women became more commonplace. This period also saw diversification in women's roles, with blurring between the roles of middle-class housewife and working mother and the representations of women of different age, race, class, sexual orientation. The appearance of strong female characters, such as in ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'', remained limited by associations of power with male approval.&lt;ref name=fantgirls2&gt;Helford, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s and 70s also saw the beginnings of SF and fantasy elements being incorporated into television programming.&lt;ref name=fantgirls2/&gt;

Popular early SF programming in the 1960s reconciled the use of SF tropes that empowered women with stereotypes of women's social domains and femininity. This was seen in popular series such as ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'' and ''[[Bewitched]]'', both of which have female protagonists with magical abilities.&lt;ref name=fantgirls2/&gt;  ''Bewitched'''s Samantha is a witch who chooses to use her abilities as a home-maker, and her husband prefers that she limits such displays of power as much as possible, particularly when they could challenge his ego. Most of her uses of magic were to save her husband appearing foolish in front of his peers or undoing interference from her more empowered and feminist mother, Endora.&lt;ref name=fantgirls2/&gt; In contrast, the titular character of ''I Dream of Jeannie'' was inept in her house-wifely duties and was more likely to use her magic when she felt it appropriate. However, this was always in the service of her "Master", who demanded her nature as a [[genie]] be kept secret. Jeannie's subservience and skimpy clothing also identified her primarily as a sex object.&lt;ref name=fantgirls3&gt;Helford, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Both programs showed women gaining more power and prominence through the metaphor of magic, but that this power was limited by women's willingness to obey male authority.&lt;ref name=fantgirls3/&gt;

The 1960s also saw the first speculative presentations of women outside the realm of domestic life.&lt;ref name=fantgirls3/&gt; ''[[Star Trek]]'''s [[Nyota Uhura|Lt. Uhura]] is a famous early example of a woman space explorer, and her race made her a role-model for black women in particular. Her inclusion in the series is credited with bringing more women into science fiction fandom. The character [[Uhura#Role_model|was seen]] as a success of the feminist and [[civil rights movement]]s of the era, representing the ideal of racial equality and women's ability to find meaningful employment outside of marriage and family. However, her role never rose beyond that of futuristic [[receptionist]], and her uniform and prominent but generally silent placement in the background of scenes made her the series primary eye candy.&lt;ref name=fantgirls3/&gt;

SF series of the 1970s followed in a similar vein, with speculative elements used to physically empower women, while society required that they pretend to be typical and non-threatening. Examples include ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'' and the television adaption of ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]''.&lt;ref name=fantgirls3/&gt;

'''[[Music]]''' is found in every known culture, past and present, varying widely between times and places. Since all people of the world, including the most isolated tribal groups, have a form of music, it may be concluded that music is likely to have been present in the ancestral population prior to the dispersal of humans around the world. Consequently, music may have been in existence for at least 50,000 years and the first music may have been invented in Africa and then evolved to become a fundamental constituent of human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallin|first=Nils Lennart|title=The Origins of Music|year=2001|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0262731430|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYQEakqM4I0C&amp;printsec=frontcover |author2=Steven Brown |author3=[[Björn Merker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krause, Bernie (2012). ''The Great Animal Orchestra: Finding the Origins of Music in the World's Wild Places''. New York: Little Brown/Hachette {{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A culture's music is influenced by all other aspects of that culture, including social and economic organization and experience, climate, and access to technology.  The emotions and ideas that music expresses, the situations in which music is played and listened to, and the attitudes toward music players and composers all vary between regions and periods. "[[Music history]]" is the distinct subfield of [[musicology]] and history which studies music (particularly [[Art music|Western art music]]) from a chronological perspective.

==Eras of music==
{{Music eras}}

===Prehistoric music===
{{Main|Prehistoric music}}
Prehistoric music, once more commonly called primitive music, is the name given to all music produced in [[Literate|preliterate]] cultures ([[prehistory]]), beginning somewhere in very late [[Historical geology|geological history]]. Prehistoric music is followed by [[ancient music]] in most of Europe (1500 BC) and later music in subsequent European-influenced areas, but still exists in isolated areas.

Prehistoric music thus technically includes all of the world's music that has existed before the advent of any currently extant historical sources concerning that music, for example, traditional [[Native American music]] of preliterate tribes and [[Australian Aboriginal music]]. However, it is more common to refer to the "prehistoric" music of non-European continents – especially that which still survives – as [[Folk music|folk]], indigenous or traditional music. The origin of music is unknown as it occurred prior to recorded history. Some suggest that the origin of music likely stems from naturally occurring [[sound]]s and [[rhythm]]s. Human music may echo these [[phenomena]] using [[patterns]], [[repetition (music)|repetition]] and [[tonality]]. Even today, some cultures have certain instances of their [[Sound mimesis in various cultures|music intending to imitate natural sounds]]. In some instances, this feature is related to [[Imitation of sounds in shamanism|shamanistic beliefs or practice]].&lt;ref name=onom&gt;[http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf Hoppál 2006: 143] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105719/http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=soy&gt;Diószegi 1960: 203&lt;/ref&gt; It may also serve entertainment (game)&lt;ref name=natt&gt;Nattiez: 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=desch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/inuit.htm|title=Inuit Throat-Singing|first=Bruno |last=Deschênes |date=January 3, 2002|website=www.mustrad.org.uk|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or practical (luring animals in hunt)&lt;ref name=natt/&gt; functions.

It is probable that the first [[musical instrument]] was the [[human voice]] itself, which can make a vast array of sounds, from singing, [[Hum (sound)|humming]] and [[whistling]] through to [[Click consonant|clicking]], [[cough]]ing and [[yawn]]ing. As for other musical instruments, in 2008 archaeologists discovered a bone flute in the [[Hohle Fels]] cave near [[Ulm]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last1 =   Conard  | first1 =   NJ  | authorlink =   | title =   A female figurine from the basal Aurignacian of Hohle Fels Cave in southwestern Germany| journal =   Nature| volume =   459| issue =   7244| pages =  248–52  | year =   2009  | doi = 10.1038/nature07995  | id = | pmid=19444215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Wilford  | first = John N. | date = June 24, 2009 | title = Flutes Offer Clues to Stone-Age Music  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/science/25flute.html  |accessdate=June 29, 2009  | work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epoc.de/artikel/999323&amp;_z=798890|title=Schwäbische Alb: Älteste Flöte vom Hohle Fels|author=|date=|website=epoc.de|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered to be about 35,000 years old, the five-holed flute has a V-shaped mouthpiece and is made from a vulture wing bone.  The oldest known wooden pipes were discovered near [[Greystones]], [[Ireland]], in 2004. A wood-lined pit contained a group of six flutes made from yew wood, between 30 and 50&amp;nbsp;cm long, tapered at one end, but without any finger holes. They may once have been strapped together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-05-10/wooden-pipe-find-excites-irish-archaeologists/1973640|title=Wooden pipe find excites Irish archaeologists|author=|date=10 May 2004|website=abc.net.au|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the "Divje Babe Flute", a cave bear femur dated to be approximately 43,500 years old, is the world's oldest musical instrument and was produced by Neanderthals. {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Claims that the femur is indeed a musical instrument are, however, contested by alternative theories including the suggestion that the femur may have been gnawed by carnivores to produce holes. {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Ancient music===
{{Main|Ancient music}}
[[Image:Harp-Sassanid.png|thumb|[[Sassanid]] women playing [[Chang (instrument)]] in [[Taq-e Bostan]], [[Iran]] (c. 379 AD)]]
The prehistoric age is considered to have ended with the development of writing, and with it, by definition, prehistoric music.  "Ancient music" is the name given to the music that followed. The "oldest known song" was written in [[cuneiform]], dating to 3400 years ago from [[Ugarit]] in [[Syria]]. It was a part of the [[Hurrian songs]], more specifically Hurian hymn no. 6. It was deciphered by Anne Draffkorn Kilmer, and was demonstrated to be composed in harmonies of thirds, like ancient ''[[gymel]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Kilmer, Crocker, Brown, ''Sounds from Silence'', 1976, Bit Enki, Berkeley, Calif., {{LCCN|76-16729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also was written using a [[Pythagorean tuning]] of the [[diatonic scale]]. The oldest surviving example of a complete musical composition, including musical notation, from anywhere in the world, is the [[Seikilos epitaph]].

Double pipes, such as those used by the [[Music of ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], and ancient bagpipes, as well as a review of ancient drawings on vases and walls, etc., and ancient writings (such as in Aristotle, ''Problems,'' Book XIX.12) which described musical techniques of the time, indicate polyphony. One pipe in the aulos pairs (double flutes) likely served as a [[Drone (music)|drone]] or "keynote," while the other played melodic passages. Instruments, such as the seven holed flute and various types of stringed instruments have been recovered from the [[Indus valley civilization]] archaeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yySNDP9XVggC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=seven+holed+flute+and+various+types+of+stringed+instruments|title=The Music of India|first1=Reginald|last1=Massey|first2=Jamila|last2=Massey|date=28 March 1996|publisher=Abhinav Publications|accessdate=28 March 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=978-8170173328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indian classical music]] (''marga'') can be found from the scriptures of the [[Hindu]] tradition, the [[Vedas]]. [[Samaveda]], one of the four vedas, describes music at length.

[[Ravanahatha]] (ravanhatta, rawanhattha, ravanastron or ravana hasta veena) is a bowed fiddle popular in Western India. It is believed to have originated among the Hela civilization of Sri Lanka in the time of King [[Ravana]]. This string instrument has been recognised as one of the oldest string instruments in world history.

The history of musical development in Iran ([[Persian traditional music|Persian music]]) dates back to the prehistoric era. The great legendary king, Jamshid, is credited with the invention of music. Music in Iran can be traced back to the days of the [[Elamite Empire]] (2500–644 BC). Fragmentary documents from various periods of the country's history establish that the ancient Persians possessed an elaborate musical culture. The [[Sassanid]] period (AD 226–651), in particular, has left us ample evidence pointing to the existence of a lively musical life in Persia. The names of some important musicians such as Barbod, Nakissa and Ramtin, and titles of some of their works have survived.

The [[Early music]] era may also include contemporary but traditional or folk music, including [[Asian music]], Persian music, [[music of India]], [[Jewish music]], [[Greek music]], [[Music of ancient Rome|Roman music]], the [[music of Mesopotamia]], the [[music of Egypt]], and [[Muslim music]].

'''Greece'''{{Main|Music of Greece}}
Greek written history extends far back into [[Ancient Greece]], and was a major part of ancient [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek theatre]]. In ancient Greece, mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration and spiritual reasons.  Instruments included the double-reed [[aulos]] and the plucked [[string instrument]], the [[lyre]], especially the special kind called a [[kithara]]. Music was an important part of education in ancient Greece, and boys were taught music starting at age six.

===Biblical period===
{{main|History of music in the biblical period}}
[[Image:David-harp.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;"David with his harp" [[Paris Psalter]],&lt;br&gt; c. 960, [[Constantinople]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
According to [[Easton's Bible Dictionary]], [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]] was named by the Bible as the inventor of musical instruments (Gen. 4:21). The [[Hebrews]] were much given to the cultivation of music. Their whole history and literature afford abundant evidence of this. After the [[Deluge myth|Deluge]], the first mention of music is in the account of [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]]'s interview with [[Jacob]] (Gen. 31:27). After their triumphal passage of the [[Red Sea]], [[Moses]] and the [[children of Israel]] sang their song of [[Book of Exodus|deliverance]] (Ex. 15). But the period of [[Samuel]], [[David]], and [[Solomon]] was the golden age of Hebrew music, as it was of [[Biblical poetry|Hebrew poetry]]. Music was now for the first time systematically cultivated. It was an essential part of training in the schools of the [[prophet]]s (1 Sam. 10:5). There now arose also a class of professional singers (2 Sam. 19:35; Eccl. 2:8). [[Solomon's Temple]], however, was the great school of music. In the conducting of its services large bands of trained singers and players on instruments were constantly employed (2 Sam. 6:5; 1 Chr. 15:16; 23;5; 25:1–6). In private life also music seems to have held an important place among the Hebrews (Eccl. 2:8; Amos 6:4–6; Isa. 5:11, 12; 24:8, 9; Ps. 137; Jer. 48:33; Luke 15:25).&lt;ref&gt;''Easton's Bible Dictionary'', "Music", 1897&lt;/ref&gt;

Music and theatre scholars studying the history and anthropology of [[Semitic people|Semitic]] and early [[Judeo-Christian]] culture, have also discovered common links between theatrical and musical activity in the classical cultures of the [[Hebrews]] with those of the later cultures of the [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The common area of performance is found in a "social phenomenon called [[litany]]," a form of prayer consisting of a series of [[invocation]]s or [[supplication]]s. ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'' notes that among the earliest forms of litany, "Hebrew litany was accompanied by a rich musical tradition:"&lt;ref name=JRT&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061004134128/http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html "A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional"] ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'', Vol. 5, No. 1, Summer 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

:While Genesis 4.21 identifies Jubal as the "father of all such as handle the harp and pipe", the [[Pentateuch]] is nearly silent about the practice and instruction of music in the early life of [[Israel]]. Then, in I Samuel 10 and the texts which follow, a curious thing happens. "One finds in the biblical text", writes Alfred Sendrey, "a sudden and unexplained upsurge of large [[choir]]s and [[orchestra]]s, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation." This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] was the [[patriarch]] of a school which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians. This public music school, perhaps the earliest in recorded history, was not restricted to a priestly class—which is how the shepherd boy [[David]] appears on the scene as a minstrel to [[King Saul]].&lt;ref name=JRT/&gt;

===Early music===
{{Main|Early music}}
Early music is music of the European classical tradition from after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]], in 476 AD, until the end of the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]] in the middle of the 18th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Music within this enormous span of time was extremely diverse, encompassing multiple cultural traditions within a wide geographic area; many of the cultural groups out of which medieval Europe developed already had musical traditions, about which little is known.  What unified these cultures in the Middle Ages was the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and its music served as the focal point for musical development for the first thousand years of this period.

While musical life was undoubtedly rich in the early [[Medieval]] era, as attested by artistic depictions of instruments, writings about music, and other records, the only repertory of music which has survived from before 800 to the present day is the [[plainsong]] liturgical music of the Roman Catholic Church, the largest part of which is called [[Gregorian chant]]. [[Pope Gregory I]], who gave his name to the musical repertory and may himself have been a composer, is usually claimed to be the originator of the musical portion of the liturgy in its present form, though the sources giving details on his contribution date from more than a hundred years after his death.  Many scholars believe that his reputation has been exaggerated by legend.  Most of the chant repertory was composed anonymously in the centuries between the time of Gregory and [[Charlemagne]].

During the 9th century several important developments took place.  First, there was a major effort by the Church to unify the many chant traditions, and suppress many of them in favor of the Gregorian liturgy.  Second, the earliest [[polyphony|polyphonic]] music was sung, a form of parallel singing known as [[organum]].  Third, and of greatest significance for music history, [[music notation|notation]] was reinvented after a lapse of about five hundred years, though it would be several more centuries before a system of pitch and rhythm notation evolved having the precision and flexibility that modern musicians take for granted.

Several schools of polyphony flourished in the period after 1100:  the [[St. Martial school]] of organum, the music of which was often characterized by a swiftly moving part over a single sustained line; the [[Notre Dame school]] of polyphony, which included the composers [[Léonin]] and [[Pérotin]], and which produced the first music for more than two parts around 1200; the musical melting-pot of [[Santiago de Compostela]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], a pilgrimage destination and site where musicians from many traditions came together in the late Middle Ages, the music of whom survives in the [[Codex Calixtinus]]; and the English school, the music of which survives in the [[Worcester Fragments]] and the [[Old Hall Manuscript]].  Alongside these schools of sacred music a vibrant tradition of secular song developed, as exemplified in the music of the [[troubadour]]s, [[trouvère]]s and [[minnesinger|Minnesänger]].  Much of the later secular music of the early [[Renaissance]] evolved from the forms, ideas, and the musical aesthetic of the troubadours, courtly poets and itinerant musicians, whose culture was largely exterminated during the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in the early 13th century.

Forms of sacred music which developed during the late 13th century included the [[motet]], [[conductus]], [[discant]], and [[Clausula (music)|clausulae]].  One unusual development was the ''[[Geisslerlieder]]'', the music of wandering bands of [[flagellant]]s during two periods: the middle of the 13th century (until they were suppressed by the Church); and the period during and immediately following the [[Black Death]], around 1350, when their activities were vividly recorded and well-documented with notated music.  Their music mixed folk song styles with penitential or apocalyptic texts. The 14th century in European music history is dominated by the style of the ''[[ars nova]]'', which by convention is grouped with the medieval era in music, even though it had much in common with early Renaissance ideals and [[aesthetics]].  Much of the surviving music of the time is secular, and tends to use the [[formes fixes]]:  the [[ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]], the [[virelai]], the [[Lai (poetic form)|lai]], the [[Rondeau (music)|rondeau]], which correspond to poetic forms of the same names.  Most pieces in these forms are for one to three voices, likely with instrumental accompaniment:  famous composers include [[Guillaume de Machaut]] and [[Francesco Landini]].

===Renaissance music===&lt;!-- This section is linked from History of music --&gt;
{{Main|Renaissance music}}
The beginning of the Renaissance in music is not as clearly marked as the beginning of the Renaissance in the other arts, and unlike in the other arts, it did not begin in [[Italy]], but in northern Europe, specifically in the area currently comprising central and northern [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Belgium]].  The style of the [[Burgundian school|Burgundian]] composers, as the first generation of the [[Dutch School (music)|Franco-Flemish]] school is known, was at first a reaction against the excessive complexity and mannered style of the late 14th century  ''[[ars subtilior]]'', and contained clear, singable melody and balanced [[polyphony]] in all voices.  The most famous composers of the Burgundian school in the mid-15th century are [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Gilles Binchois]], and [[Antoine Busnois]].

By the middle of the 15th century, composers and singers from the [[Low Countries]] and adjacent areas began to spread across Europe, especially into Italy, where they were employed by the papal chapel and the aristocratic patrons of the arts (such as the [[Medici]], the [[House of Este|Este]], and the [[Sforza]] families).  They carried their style with them: smooth polyphony which could be adapted for sacred or secular use as appropriate.  Principal forms of sacred musical composition at the time were the [[mass (music)|mass]], the [[motet]], and the [[laude]]; secular forms included the [[chanson]], the [[frottola]], and later the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]].

The invention of [[printing]] had an immense influence on the dissemination of musical styles, and along with the movement of the Franco-Flemish musicians, contributed to the establishment of the first truly international style in European music since the unification of Gregorian chant under Charlemagne.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Composers of the middle generation of the Franco-Flemish school included [[Johannes Ockeghem]], who wrote music in a contrapuntally complex style, with varied texture and an elaborate use of [[canon (music)|canonical]] devices; [[Jacob Obrecht]], one of the most famous composers of masses in the last decades of the 15th century; and [[Josquin des Prez]], probably the most famous composer in Europe before [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], and who during the 16th century was renowned as one of the greatest artists in any form. Music in the generation after Josquin explored increasing complexity of [[counterpoint]]; possibly the most extreme expression is in the music of [[Nicolas Gombert]], whose contrapuntal complexities influenced early instrumental music, such as the [[canzona]] and the [[ricercar]], ultimately culminating in [[Baroque music|Baroque]] [[fugue|fugal]] forms.

By the middle of the 16th century, the international style began to break down, and several highly diverse stylistic trends became evident:  a trend towards simplicity in sacred music, as directed by the [[Counter-Reformation]] [[Council of Trent]], exemplified in the music of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]; a trend towards complexity and [[chromaticism]] in the madrigal, which reached its extreme expression in the [[avant-garde]] style of the [[Ferrara School]] of [[Luzzasco Luzzaschi|Luzzaschi]] and the late century madrigalist [[Carlo Gesualdo]]; and the grandiose, sonorous music of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian school]], which used the architecture of the Basilica [[San Marco di Venezia]] to create [[polychoral|antiphonal]] contrasts.  The music of the Venetian school included the development of [[orchestration]], ornamented instrumental parts, and [[basso continuo|continuo]] bass parts, all of which occurred within a span of several decades around 1600.  Famous composers in [[Venice]] included the Gabrielis, [[Andrea Gabrieli|Andrea]] and [[Giovanni Gabrieli|Giovanni]], as well as [[Claudio Monteverdi]], one of the most significant innovators at the end of the era.

Most parts of Europe had active and well-differentiated musical traditions by late in the century.  In England, composers such as [[Thomas Tallis]] and [[William Byrd]] wrote sacred music in a style similar to that written on the continent, while an active group of home-grown madrigalists adapted the Italian form for English tastes:  famous composers included [[Thomas Morley]], [[John Wilbye]] and [[Thomas Weelkes]]. Spain developed instrumental and vocal styles of its own, with [[Tomás Luis de Victoria]] writing refined music similar to that of Palestrina, and numerous other composers writing for the new guitar.  Germany cultivated polyphonic forms built on the Protestant [[chorale]]s, which replaced the Roman Catholic Gregorian Chant as a basis for sacred music, and imported the style of the Venetian school (the appearance of which defined the start of the Baroque era there).  In addition, German composers wrote enormous amounts of [[organ (music)|organ]] music, establishing the basis for the later Baroque organ style which culminated in the work of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]].  France developed a unique style of musical diction known as [[musique mesurée]], used in secular chansons, with composers such as [[Guillaume Costeley]] and [[Claude Le Jeune]] prominent in the movement.

One of the most revolutionary movements in the era took place in Florence in the 1570s and 1580s, with the work of the [[Florentine Camerata]], who ironically had a reactionary intent:  dissatisfied with what they saw as contemporary musical depravities, their goal was to restore the music of the ancient Greeks.  Chief among them were [[Vincenzo Galilei]], the father of the astronomer, and [[Giulio Caccini]].  The fruits of their labors was a declamatory melodic singing style known as [[monody]], and a corresponding staged dramatic form:  a form known today as [[opera]].  The first operas, written around 1600, also define the end of the Renaissance and the beginning of the Baroque eras.

Music prior to 1600 was [[musical mode|modal]] rather than [[Tonality|tonal]].  Several theoretical developments late in the 16th century, such as the writings on scales on [[mode (music)|modes]] by [[Gioseffo Zarlino]] and [[Franchinus Gaffurius]], led directly to the development of common practice tonality.  The major and minor scales began to predominate over the old [[church modes]], a feature which was at first most obvious at cadential points in compositions, but gradually became pervasive.  Music after 1600, beginning with the tonal music of the Baroque era, is often referred to as belonging to the [[common practice period]].

The Baroque era took place from 1600 to 1750, as the [[Baroque|Baroque artistic style]] flourished across Europe and, during this time, music expanded in its range and complexity. Baroque music began when the first operas (dramatic solo vocal music accompanied by orchestra) were written. During the Baroque era, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music, in which multiple, simultaneous independent melody lines were used, remained important (counterpoint was important in the vocal music of the Medieval era).{{Clarify|date=April 2018}}&lt;!--But not in the Renaissance? Or what?--&gt; German, Italian, French, Dutch, Polish, Spanish, Portuguese, and English Baroque composers wrote for small [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] including [[String section|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], as well as for [[choir]]s and keyboard instruments such as [[organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], and [[clavichord]]. During this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], the [[sonata]], and the concerto.&lt;ref name="sdsu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |title=''Baroque Music'' by Elaine Thornburgh and Jack Logan, Ph.D. |publisher=trumpet.sdsu.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905175129/http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Important composers from the Baroque era include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]], [[François Couperin]], [[Girolamo Frescobaldi]], [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] and [[Antonio Vivaldi]].

===Classical music era===&lt;!-- This section is linked from History of music --&gt;
{{Main|Classical period (music)}}
The music of the Classical period is characterized by [[homophonic texture]], or an obvious [[melody]] with [[accompaniment]].  These new melodies tended to be almost voice-like and singable, allowing composers to actually replace singers as the focus of the music.  Instrumental music therefore quickly replaced [[opera]] and other sung forms (such as [[oratorio]]) as the favorite of the musical audience and the epitome of great composition.  However, opera did not disappear: during the classical period, several composers began producing operas for the general public in their native languages (previous operas were generally in Italian).

[[Image:Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart 1.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s compositions characterized music of the classical era.]]
Along with the gradual displacement of the voice in favor of stronger, clearer melodies, counterpoint also typically became a decorative flourish, often used near the end of a work or for a single [[Movement (music)|movement]].  In its stead, simple patterns, such as arpeggios and, in piano music, [[Alberti bass]] (an accompaniment with a repeated pattern typically in the left hand), were used to liven the movement of the piece without creating a confusing additional voice.  The now-popular instrumental music was dominated by several well-defined forms: the [[sonata (music)|sonata]], the [[symphony]], and the [[concerto]], though none of these were specifically defined or taught at the time as they are now in [[music theory]].  All three derive from [[sonata form]], which is both the overlying form of an entire work and the structure of a single movement. Sonata form matured during the Classical era to become the primary form of instrumental compositions throughout the 19th century.

The early Classical period was ushered in by the [[Mannheim School]], which included such composers as [[Johann Stamitz]], [[Franz Xaver Richter]], [[Carl Stamitz]], and [[Christian Cannabich]]. It exerted a profound influence on [[Joseph Haydn]] and, through him, on all subsequent European music. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was the central figure of the Classical period, and his phenomenal and varied output in all genres defines our perception of the period. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] were transitional composers, leading into the Romantic period, with their expansion of existing genres, forms, and even functions of music.

[[Image:Siegfried - Heinrich Gudehus.jpg|right|thumbnail|150px|The title character from a 19th-century performance of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]'']]
In the Romantic period, music became more expressive and emotional, expanding to encompass literature, art, and philosophy. Famous early Romantic composers include [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]. The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the [[orchestra]], and in the role of concerts as part of [[urban culture|urban]] society. Famous composers from the second half of the century include [[Johann Strauss II]], [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]. Between 1890 and 1910, a third wave of composers including [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], and [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] built on the work of middle Romantic composers to create even more complex&amp;nbsp;– and often much longer&amp;nbsp;– musical works. A prominent mark of late 19th century music is its nationalistic fervor, as exemplified by such figures as Dvořák, Sibelius, and [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]]. Other prominent late-century figures include [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]] and [[César Franck|Franck]].

===20th and 21st-century music===
{{Main|20th-century music}}
The 20th century saw a revolution in music listening as the radio gained popularity worldwide and new media and technologies were developed to record, capture, reproduce and distribute music. Music performances became increasingly visual with the broadcast and recording of music videos and concerts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Music of all kinds also became increasingly portable. Headphones allowed people sitting next to each other to listen to entirely different performances or share the same performance.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

20th-century music brought a new freedom and wide experimentation with new musical styles and forms that challenged the accepted rules of music of earlier periods.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} The invention of musical [[Amplifier|amplification]] and [[electronic instrument]]s, especially the synthesizer, in the mid-20th century revolutionized popular music and accelerated the development of new forms of music.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Africa===
{{Main|African music}}
Sub-Saharan African music is by a strong rhythmic interest that exhibits common characteristics in all regions of this vast territory, so that Arthur Morris Jones (1889–1980) has described the many local approaches as constituting one main system.
C. K.  also affirms the profound homogeneity of approach. West African rhythmic techniques carried over the Atlantic were fundamental ingredients in various musical styles of the Americas: [[samba]], [[forró]], [[maracatu]] and [[Coco (music)|coco]] in Brazil, Afro-Cuban music and Afro-American musical genres such as [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[rhythm &amp; blues]], [[funk]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[reggae]], [[hip hop]] and [[rock and roll]] were thereby of immense importance in 20th-century popular music.{{Clarify|date=February 2018}}&lt;!--What has any of this to do with extra-European "classical" music?--&gt;

===Byzantium===
{{Main|Byzantine music}}
[[Byzantine music]] (Greek: Βυζαντινή Μουσική) is the music of the Byzantine Empire composed to Greek texts as ceremonial, festival, or church music. Greek and foreign historians agree that the ecclesiastical tones and in general the whole system of Byzantine music is closely related to the ancient Greek system. It remains the oldest genre of extant music, of which the manner of performance and (with increasing accuracy from the 5th century onwards) the names of the composers, and sometimes the particulars of each musical work's circumstances, are known.

Various types of stringed instruments and drums have been recovered from [[Harrappa]] and [[Mohenjo-daro|Mohenjo Daro]] by excavations carried out by [[Sir Mortimer Wheeler]].&lt;ref&gt;World History: Societies of the Past By Charles Kahn (p. 11)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rigveda]] has elements of present Indian music, with a musical notation to denote the metre and the mode of chanting.&lt;ref&gt;World Music: The Basics By Nidel Nidel, Richard O. Nidel (p. 10)&lt;/ref&gt; Early Indian musical tradition also speaks of three accents and vocal music known as "Samagan" (Sama meaning melody and Gan meaning to sing).&lt;ref&gt;The Music of India By Jamila Massey, Reginald Massey (p. 13)&lt;/ref&gt; The classical music of India includes two major traditions: the southern [[Carnatic music]] and the northern [[Hindustani classical music]]. India's classical music tradition is millennia long and remains important to the lives of Indians today as a source of religious inspiration, cultural expression, and entertainment.

Indian classical music (marga) is monophonic, and based on a single melody line or [[raga]] rhythmically organized through [[Tala (music)|talas]]. Carnatic music is largely devotional; the majority of the songs are addressed to the Hindu deities. There are a lot of songs emphasising love and other social issues. In contrast to Carnatic music, Hindustani music was not only influenced by ancient Hindu musical traditions, Vedic philosophy and native Indian sounds but also by the Persian performance practices of the Afghan Mughals. The origins of Indian classical music can be found from the oldest of scriptures, part of the [[Hindu]] tradition, the [[Vedas]]. [[Samaveda]], one of the four vedas describes music at length.

===China===
{{Main|Chinese classical music}}
Chinese classical music is the traditional art or court music of China. It has a long history stretching for more than three thousand years. It has its own unique systems of musical notation, as well as musical tuning and pitch, musical instruments and styles or musical genres.  Chinese music is pentatonic-diatonic, having a scale of twelve notes to an octave (5+7 = 12) as does European-influenced music.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The '''International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development''' (ICIMOD) is a regional intergovernmental learning and knowledge sharing centre serving the eight regional member countries of the Hindu Kush Himalayas [http://www.icimod.org/?q=1137]. ICIMOD serves eight regional member countries (RMCs) of the Hindu Kush Himalayan region – [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nepal]], and [[Pakistan]] – and the global mountain community. Founded in 1983, ICIMOD is based in [[Lalitpur, Nepal|Lalitpur]], Nepal, and brings together a partnership of its regional member countries, partner institutions, and donors with a commitment for development action to secure a better future for the people and environment of the extended Himalayan region.

==Vision==
Men, women, and children of the Hindu Kush Himalayas enjoy improved well being.

==Mission==
To enable sustainable and resilient mountain development for improved and equitable livelihoods through knowledge and regional cooperation.

==History==

The idea of creating an institution to promote the ecologically sound development of mountainous regions was first discussed at the International Workshop on the Development of Mountain Environment in December 1974 in Munich, Germany, but it was only five years later in 1979 during a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation ([[UNESCO]]) Regional Meeting in Kathmandu, under the framework of the Man and the Biosphere Programme, that concrete commitments were made to establish the Centre. The Government of Nepal offered to host the new institution, and the Governments of Switzerland and the Federal Republic of Germany and UNESCO agreed to act as the founding sponsors. His Majesty’s Government of Nepal and UNESCO signed the agreement that provided the legal basis for establishing the Centre in September 1981 in Paris. The Centre was finally established and inaugurated on 5 December 1983 with its headquarters in Lalitpur, Nepal, and legitimised through an Act of Parliament in Nepal in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ceh.resourcehub.ssrc.org/international-center-for-integrated-mountain-development-icimod/institution_view |publisher=China Environment and Health Resources Hub |title=International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813081415/http://ceh.resourcehub.ssrc.org/international-center-for-integrated-mountain-development-icimod/institution_view |archivedate=2011-08-13 |accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17160">{{canon law}}Regarding the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the [[Catholic Church]], canonists provide and obey rules for the '''interpretation''' and acceptation of words, in order that [[legislation]] is correctly understood and the extent of its obligation is determined.

==Authentic interpretation==
{{see also|Regulae Juris}}
An "authentic interpretation" is an official and authoritative interpretation of a [[statute]] issued by the [[legislator]] of the statute. In [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] an authentic interpretation has the [[force of law]].

Besides the [[Supreme Pontiff]] (Pope), who has plenary legislative power, several other authorities in the [[Catholic Church]] have various grades of legislative power. Primary examples are diocesan [[bishops]] and their equivalents, [[episcopal conference]]s, and [[synod|particular council]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Canon L. Socy. Gr. Brit. &amp; Ir., ''The Canon Law Letter and Spirit: A Practical Guide to the Code of Canon Law'' ¶ 46, at 15, 15 n. 2 (Gerard Sheehy et al. eds., Liturgical Press 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Any of these [[legislator]]s can issue authentic interpretations of their own&lt;ref&gt;''[[Codex Iuris Canonici]]'' (''CIC''), Canon 16, §1; ''[[Codex Canonum Ecclesiarum Orientalium]]'' (''CCEO''), Canon 1498.&lt;/ref&gt; and their predecessors' laws&lt;ref&gt;''The Canon Law Letter and Spirit'', ¶ 46, at 15 (Rev. Augustine Mendonça, JCD).&lt;/ref&gt;. Authentic interpretations supersede even administrative decisions of [[ordinary (officer)|ordinaries]] and judgments of [[ecclesiastical courts]], because neither of these acts have the [[force of law]] which authentic interpretations have.&lt;ref&gt;''CIC'', Canon 16, §3; ''CCEO'', Canon 1498, §3.&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of an authentic interpretation is contingent on the extent of the interpretation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
An authentic interpretation which is presented by way of a law has the same force as the law itself, and must be promulgated. If it simply declares the words which are certain in themselves, it has retroactive force. If it restricts or extends a law or explains a doubtful one, it is not retroactive.&lt;ref&gt;''CIC'', Canon 16, §2, ''translated in'' ''The Canon Law Letter and Spirit'' 16 ("Interpretatio authentica per modum legis exhibita eandem vim habet ac lex ipsa et promulgari debet; si verba legis in se certa declaret tantum, valet retrorsum; si legem coarctet vel extendataut dubiam explicet, non retrotrahitur.").&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Legislators also can entrust the power to authentically interpret their laws to another.&lt;ref&gt;''CIC'', Canon 16, §1; ''CCEO'', Canon 1498, §1.&lt;/ref&gt; For the ''[[1983 Code of Canon Law]]'', the ''[[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]]'', and other [[Supreme Pontiff|Papal]] laws, the [[Supreme Pontiff]] has delegated authority of authentic interpretation to the [[Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts]].&lt;ref&gt;Pope Saint John Paul II, apostolic constitution ''Pastor Bonus'', Article 155, 80 ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' 841 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  The following table lists the authentic interpretations that this [[dicastery]] has issued (with [[Supreme Pontiff|Papal]] approbation).

==Rules of interpretation==
In general, the authentic interpretation of a law may be made by the legislator or his successor or superior, but when this is not the case recourse must be had to what is called magisterial, or doctrinal, interpretation. It is for this latter mode that rules have been formed.

===Words===

The specific words of a law are understood according to their usual signification, unless it is certain that the legislator intended them to be understood otherwise. When words are unambiguous, they must not be twisted into another, improbable signification. If the intention of the legislator regarding words in question is known, interpretation must accord therewith, rather than with the usual signification of the words, because in this instance the words are said not to be ''nude'' but rather ''clothed'' with the will of the legislator.

When a law is stated in general terms, it is presumed that no exception was intended; that is, if the general law states no exception, interpreters may not distinguish specific cases. Regarding all interpretations, however, that signification of the words in question is to be preferred that favors [[Equity (law)|equity]] rather than strict [[justice]]. An argument can be made from the contrary signification of the words, provided that it does produce a result that is absurd, inappropriate, or contradicted by another law. Further, the provisions of a prior statute are presumed not to be changed beyond the express signification of the words of a new law.

When a law is [[penal]] in nature, its words are to be construed in their strictest sense and not to be extended to cases that are not explicitly stated, but when a law concedes favors, its words are to be interpreted in their widest sense. "In contracts, words are to be taken in their full [plena] meaning, in last wills in a wider [plenior] sense, and in grants of favours in their widest [plenissimi] interpretation".&lt;ref&gt;C. ''Cum Dilecti'', 6 de donat.&lt;/ref&gt; When the signification of words is doubtful, that sense is to be preferred that does not prejudice the rights of a third person, i. e., a person whom the law does not directly affect or concern.

Words of a law are never presumed to be superfluous. Words must be considered in their context. An interpretation of words that renders the law in question futile is a false interpretation. When words are in the [[future tense]], and even when they are in the [[imperative mood]] regarding the judge, but not regarding the crime, the [[Sentence (law)|penalty]] is understood to be incurred not ''ipso facto'' but only upon judicial sentence. When words are doubtful they must be presumed to favor the subjects thereof and not the legislator.

==Magisterial doctrine on canonical interpretation "within the Church"==
The instructions of the [[Magisterium]] regarding [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] and its interpretation are binding ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]'' insofar as it teaches of the law.&lt;ref name=BenedictXVI/&gt; The juridically binding instructions on canonical interpretation of the [[Magisterium]] are primarily given in the [[allocution]]s of the [[Supreme Pontiff]]s to the [[Tribunal of the Roman Rota]].&lt;ref name=BenedictXVI/&gt;

[[Pope Benedict XVI]], in his address of 21 January 2012 to the [[Roman Rota]], taught that canonical law can only be interpreted and fully understood within the [[Catholic Church]] in the light of her mission and [[ecclesiology (Catholic Church)|ecclesiological]] structure, and that "the work of the interpreter must not be deprived of 'vital contact with ecclesial reality":&lt;ref name=BenedictXVI&gt;Pope Benedict XVI, ''2012 Roman Rota Address''.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|All things considered, the hermeneutics of canonical laws is most closely tied to the very understanding of the law of the Church....In such realistic prospectiveness, the interpretative undertaking, at times arduous, takes on meaning and purpose. The use of the interpretive meaning foreseen by the Code of Canon Law in can. 17, beginning with "the proper meaning of the words considered in their text and context", is no longer a mere logical exercise. It has to do with an assignment that is vivified by an authentic contact with the comprehensive reality of the Church, which allows one to penetrate the true meaning of the letter of the law. Something then occurs, similar to what I said about the inner process of St Augustine in biblical hermeneutics: "the transcending of the letter has rendered the letter itself credible".&lt;ref group=note&gt;Benedict XVI, ''2012 Roman Rota Address'', citing Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Verbum Domini, 30 September 2010, 38: AAS 102 (2010), p. 718, n. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In such a manner, also in the hermeneutics of the law is it confirmed that the authentic horizon is that of the juridical truth to love, to seek out and to serve.

It follows that the interpretation of canonical law must take place within the Church. This is not a matter of mere external circumstance, subject to the environs: it is a calling to the same ''humus'' of Canon Law and the reality regulated by it. ''Sentire cum Ecclesia''  takes on meaning also within the discipline, by reason of the doctrinal foundations that are always present and operative within the legal norms of the Church. In this manner, is also applied to Canon Law that hermeneutics of renewal in continuity of which I spoke in reference to the Second Vatican Council&lt;ref group=note&gt;Benedict XVI, ''2012 Roman Rota Address'', citing his Discourse to the Roman Curia of 22 December 2005: AAS 98 (2006), pp. 40-53., https://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/speeches/2005/december/documents/hf_ben_xvi_spe_20051222_roman-curia.html&lt;/ref&gt; so closely bound to the current canonical legislation. Christian maturity leads one to love the law ever more and want to understand it and to apply it faithfully.&lt;ref name=BenedictXVI/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

[[File:NSC KIPT 04.jpg|thumb|right|200px|National Science Center, Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology]]
The '''National Science Center Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology (KIPT)''' ({{lang-uk|Національний науковий центр «Харківський фізико-технічний інститут»}}, formerly Ukrainian Institute of Physics and Technology) is the oldest and largest [[physical science]] research centre in [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kipt.kharkov.ua/en/bhr.html|title=History {{!}} ННЦ ХФТИ|website=www.kipt.kharkov.ua|access-date=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is known as a [[Science museum#Science_center|science center]] as it consists of several institutes that are part of the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology science complex.

==History==
[[File:ХФТИ.jpg|thumb|Group photo of the KIPT physicists in 1934]]
[[File:NSC KIPT 03.jpg|thumb|Commemoritve plaque about the nuclear fission conducted in 1932]]
The institute was founded on 30 October 1928 by the Government of Soviet Ukraine&lt;ref name=vokrugsveta&gt;Taravarov, Ya. ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20171230193505/http://www.vokrugsveta.ru/telegraph/theory/816/ Landau in a field of negative values (Ландау в области отрицательных значений)]''. Vokrug Sveta. 15 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; on an initiative of [[Abram Ioffe]] on the northern outskirts of [[Kharkiv]] (in khutir [[Piatykhatky, Kharkiv Oblast|Piatykhatky]]) as the '''Ukrainian Institute of Physics and Technology''' for the purpose of research on [[nuclear physics]] and [[condensed matter physics]]. Note that Kharkiv at that time was the capital of [[Soviet Ukraine]]. An opening of the institute precisely in [[Kharkiv]] had an ideological implication: At height of being defeated by the [[Russian Red Army]], the "samostiynyky"{{efn|a ridiculed name for Ukrainians in Russia}} of various modifications who laid at the basis of Ukrainian [[national consciousness]] their culture of the past, the [[Soviet Ukraine]] has implemented new culture based on advanced achievements of the human intellect and modern technologies rather than on [[sharovary]] (Ukrainian traditional dress), [[Ukrainian folk music|folk songs]], and [[oseledets]] (Ukrainian Cossack hairstyle).&lt;ref name=vokrugsveta/&gt;

From the moment of its creation, the institute was run by the [[People's Commissariat of Heavy Industry]].&lt;ref name=vokrugsveta/&gt;

On 10 October 1932 the first experiments in [[nuclear fission]] in the [[Soviet Union]] were conducted here. The Soviet nuclear physicists [[Anton Valter]], [[Georgiy Latyshev]], [[Cyril Sinelnikov]], and [[Aleksandr Leipunskii]] used a [[lithium]] atom nucleus. Later the Ukrainian Institute of Physics and Technology was able to obtain [[liquid hydrogen]] and helium. They also constructed a [[radar]] station, and the institute became a pioneer of the Soviet high [[vacuum engineering]] which was developed into an industrial [[vacuum metallurgy]].

During the Stalin epoch, this was where the [[UPTI Affair]] occurred in 1938: three leading physicists of the Kharkiv Institute ([[Lev Landau]], [[Yuri Rumer]] and Moisey Korets) were arrested by the Soviet secret police.

The Ukrainian Institute of Physics and Technology was the "Laboratory no. 1" for nuclear physics, and was responsible for the first development of a nuclear bomb in the former USSR.

'''Kurt Pahlen'''(May 26, 1907 – July 24, 2003) was an Austrian conductor and musicologist.

== Life ==
Pahlen was born in [[Vienna]], in 1907. At the age of seven, he lost his father, the song accompanist Richard Pahlen. His mother got married for the second time to the banker Paul Raumann and moved to Berlin-[[Schmargendorf]] with him and his son. Kurt Pahlen studied musicology and German studies in his hometown. In addition, he completed an apprenticeship as [[Kapellmeister]] at the [[University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna|Vienna Music Academy]]. In 1929 he received his doctorate.&lt;ref name="EA"&gt;[http://www.exilarchiv.de/DE/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2655%3Apahlen-kurt&amp;catid=43&amp;lang=pl Exilarchiv]&lt;/ref&gt;

After his first successes as Kapellmeister of the [[Vienna Volksoper]] and  being appreciated by the {{ill|Revolutionary Socialists of Austria|de|Revolutionäre Sozialisten Österreichs}} as choirmaster, he directed the music events of the Volkshochschule [[Ottakring]]. He was a conductor at [[Radio Wien]] and the [[Vienna Symphony]] and founded an opera studio at Ludo-Hartmann-Platz in the working-class district of Ottakring. Although, according to his own statement he was not personally threatened by [[Nazism]],&lt;ref&gt;See however https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-1971-25807-21000-35?cc=2028320&amp;wc=MMGD-23S:n1857874792&lt;/ref&gt; Pahlen did not return in 1938 from a stay in Zürich and emigrated in 1939 to Argentina. In [[Buenos Aires]] he became the music director and head of the Filarmónica Metropolitana, in which also played with the Austrian emigrant Estéban Eitler. Pahlen then became a professor at the [[University of the Republic (Uruguay)|Universidad de la República]] in [[Montevideo]] and was the founder and holder of the Department of Music History. For many years he was director of [[Teatro Colón]] in Buenos Aires; also taught at the [[Colegio Pestalozzi (Argentina)|Pestalozzi School Buenos Aires.]] In those years he befriended [[Manuel de Falla]], [[Paul Hindemith]], and also from Vienna, [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]].

After the end of the Third Reich, Pahlen conducted in the [[Vienna State Opera]], the [[Zürich Opera House|Zurich Opera]], [[Theater Basel]], [[Bern Theatre]], [[Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe]] and other houses. He has performed with the[[NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchestra|NDR Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Orchestre de la Suisse Romande]], the [[Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg]] and other orchestras. In the early 1970s, Pahlen returned to Switzerland and settled in [[Männedorf]]. He was professor at the Internationales Opernstudio of the Zürich Opera House. He taught masterclasses and was president of the Forum for Music and Movement in Lenk. He was [[visiting scholar]] at the [[University of Buenos Aires]],  [[National University of La Plata]], [[Federal University of  Rio de Janeiro]], [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], [[Meritorious Autonomous University of Puebla|Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla]], [[University of Monterrey]], [[Universidad Veracruzana]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;"Kurt Pahlen", in: Kurt Pahlen: ''Richard Wagner.'' {{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the {{lang|de|Musiktage}} organized by him for children in [[Lenk im Simmental|Lenk]], he died as a result of a fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/9d4f9ecf50cc7f6dd791f4f80e4616e2|title=Obituaries in the News|work=AP News|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
Since 1944, Pahlen wrote over 40 books, some of which were translated into 16 languages. His radio and television programs as well as his introductory lectures at the [[Salzburg Easter Festival]], Verona Opera Festival, [[Munich Opera Festival]], [[Vienna Festival]], and [[Bregenz Festival]] made him known to a large audience. Not only opera-goers, but also musicians, singers and conductors appreciate the guide he has published in the series "Operas of the World" on famous works of music theater.

The '''National Health Laboratory Service''' (NHLS) is a South African national government institution established in 2001. It was created by merging the [[South African Institute for Medical Research]] (SAIMR), the [[National Centre for Occupational Health]] and the [[National Institute for Virology]]. It also absorbed various provincial health department and university-run pathology laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhls.ac.za/?page=who_are_we&amp;id=17 |title=National Health Laboratory Service &amp;#124; Who Are We? |publisher=Nhls.ac.za |date= |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NHLS is the diagnostic pathology service for the public sector in South Africa. A network of 265&lt;ref name="healthcareglobal1" /&gt; laboratories service all public hospitals and clinics in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhls.ac.za/?page=diagnostic_services&amp;id=25 |title=National Health Laboratory Service &amp;#124; Diagnostic Services |publisher=Nhls.ac.za |date= |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions and subsidiaries==
Besides the network of pathology laboratories operated by the NHLS the institution also has a number of specialist divisions:

===National Institute for Communicable Diseases===
The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) was created by combining various structures inherited from the NHLS's parent organisations. The former National Institute for [[Virology]] was combined with the former SAIMR's specialist laboratories of [[microbiology]], [[parasitology]], and [[entomology]] to create a communicable diseases institute with a public health orientation, comparable to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ianphi.org/membercountries/memberinformation/southafrica.html |title=South Africa |publisher=Ianphi.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regard to agriculture, [[Abiotic stress]] is stress produced by '''natural environment factors''' such as extreme [[temperature]]s, [[wind]], [[drought]], and [[salinity]]. Humankind doesn’t have much control over abiotic stresses. It is very important for humans to understand how stress factors affect plants and other living things so that we can take some preventative measures. 

Preventative measures are the only way that humans can protect themselves and their possessions from abiotic stress. There are many different types of abiotic stressors, and several methods that humans can use to reduce the negative effects of stress on living things.

== Cold ==
One of the types of Abiotic Stress is [[cold]]. This has a huge impact on farmers. Cold impacts crop growers all over the world in every single country. Yields suffer and farmers also suffer huge losses because the weather is just too cold to produce crops (Xiong &amp; Zhu, 2001). 

Humans have planned the planting of our crops around the seasons. Even though the seasons are fairly predictable, there are always unexpected storms, heat waves, or cold snaps that can ruin our growing seasons.(Suzuki &amp; Mittler, 2006)

ROS stands for reactive oxygen species. ROS plays a large role in mediating events through transduction. Cold stress was shown to enhance the transcript, protein, and activity of different ROS-scavenging enzymes. Low temperature stress has also been shown to increase the H2 O2 accumulation in cells.(Suzuki &amp; Mittler, 2006)

Plants can be acclimated to low or even freezing temperatures. If a plant can go through a mild cold spell this activates the cold-responsive genes in the plant. Then if the temperature drops again, the genes will have conditioned the plant to cope with the low temperature. Even below freezing temperatures can be survived if the proper genes are activated (Suzuki &amp; Mittler, 2006).

== Heat ==
[[Heat]] stress has been shown to cause problems in [[mitochondrial]] functions and can result in [[oxidative]] damage. Activators of heat stress receptors and defenses are thought to be related to ROS. Heat is another thing that plants can deal with if they have the proper pretreatment. This means that if the temperature gradually warms up the plants are going to be better able to cope with the change. A sudden long temperature increase could cause damage to the plant because their cells and receptors haven’t had enough time to prepare for a major temperature change.

Heat stress can also have a detrimental effect on plant reproduction. Temperatures 10 degrees Celsius or more above normal growing temperatures can have a bad effect on several plant reproductive functions. Pollen [[meiosis]], pollen germination, [[ovule]] development, ovule viability, development of the embryo, and seedling growth are all aspects of plant reproduction that are affected by heat.(Cross, McKay, McHughen, &amp; Bonham-Smith, 2003)

There have been many studies on the effects of heat on plant reproduction. One study on plants was conducted on [[Canola]] plants at 28 degrees Celsius, the result was decreased plant size, but the plants were still fertile. Another experiment was conducted on Canola plants at 32 degrees Celsius, this resulted in the production of sterile plants. Plants seem to be more easily damaged by extreme temperatures during the late flower to early seed development stage (Cross, McKay, McHughen, &amp; Bonham-Smith, 2003).

== Wind ==
Wind is a huge part of abiotic stress. There is simply no way to stop the wind from blowing. This is definitely a bigger problem in some parts of the world than in others. Barren areas such as deserts are very susceptible to natural wind erosion. These types of areas don’t have any vegetation to hold the soil particles in place. Once the wind starts to blow the soil around, there is nothing to stop the process. The only chance for the soil to stay in place is if the wind doesn’t blow. This is usually not an option.

Plant growth in windblown areas is very limited. Because the soil is constantly moving, there is no opportunity for plants to develop a root system. Soil that blows a lot usually is very dry also. This leaves little [[nutrient]]s to promote plant growth.

Farmland is typically very susceptible to wind erosion. Most farmers do not plant cover crops during the seasons when their main crops are not in the fields. They simply leave the ground open and uncovered. When the soil is dry, the top layer becomes similar to powder. When the wind blows, the powdery top layer of the farmland is picked up and carried for miles. This is the exact scenario that occurred during the “Dust Bowl” in the 30’s. The combination of drought and poor farming practices allowed the wind to moves thousands of tons of dirt from one area to the next.

Wind is one of the factors that humans can really have some control over. Simply practice good farming practices. Don’t leave ground bare and without any type of vegetation. During dry seasons it is especially important to have the land covered because dry soil moves much easier than wet soil in the wind.

When soil is not blowing due to the wind, conditions are much better for plant growth. Plants cannot grow in a soil that is constantly blowing. Their root systems do not have time to be established. Also, when soil particles are blowing they wear away at the plants that they run into. Plants are essentially “sand blasted.”

== Drought ==
Drought is very detrimental to all types of plant growth. When there is no water in the soil there are not very many nutrients to support plant growth. Drought also enhances the effects of wind. When drought occurs the soil becomes very dry and light. The wind picks up this dry dirt and carries it away. This action severely degrades the soil and creates a poor condition for growing plants.

== Adaptation of plants ==
Plants have been exposed to the elements for thousands of years. During this time they have evolved in order to lessen the effects of abiotic stress. Signal transduction is the mechanism in plants that is responsible for the adaptation of plants (Xiong &amp; Zhu, 2001). Many signaling transduction networks have been discovered and studied in microbial and animal systems. There is limited knowledge in the plant field because it is very difficult to find exactly which phenotypes in the plant are affected by stressors. These phenotypes are very valuable to the researchers. They need to know the phenotypes so that they can create a method to screen for mutant genes. Mutants are the key to finding signaling pathways in living creatures.

&lt;nowiki&gt;Animals and microbes easier to run tests on because they show a reaction fairly quickly when a stress factor is put on them, this leads to the isolation of the specific gene.  There have been decades of research on the effects of temperature, drought, and salinity, but not very many answers.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

== Receptors ==
The part of the plants, animal, or microbe that first senses an abiotic stress factor is a receptor. Once a signal is picked up by a receptor, signals are transmitted intercellularly and then they activate nuclear transcription to get the effects of a certain set of genes. These activated genes  allow the plant to respond to the stress that it is experiencing. Even though none of the receptors for cold, drought, salinity or the stress hormone abscisic acid in plants is known for sure, the knowledge that we have today shows that receptor-like protein kinases, two-component histidine kinases, as well as G-protein receptors may be the possible sensors of these different signals.

Receptor like kinases can be found in plants as well as animals. There are many more RLKs in plants than there are in animals. They are also a little bit different. Unlike animal RLKs that usually possess tyrosine signature sequences, plant RLKs have serine or threonine signature sequences (Xiong &amp; Zhu, 2001).

== Genetically Modified Plants ==
Plants are most commonly modified to be resistant to specific [[herbicide]]s or [[pathogen]]s, but we have the technology to modify plants in order to make them resistant to specific abiotic stressors. Cold, heat, drought, or salt are all factors that could possibly be defended against by genetically modified plants.

Some plants could have genes added to them from other species of plants that have a resistance to a specific stress. Plants implanted with these genes would then become transgenic plants because they have the genes from another species of plant in them. Scientists first have to isolate the specific gene in a plant that is responsible for its resistance. The gene would then be taken out of the plant and put into another plant. The plant that is injected with the new resistant gene would have a resistance to an abiotic stressor and be able to tolerate a wider range of conditions (Weil, 2005).

This process of creating transgenic plants could have a huge impact on our nation’s economy. If plants could be genetically engineered to be resistant to a wider variety of stress, crop yields would skyrocket. With the expansion of town and cities there is a decreasing number of farm acres. Although the farm acres are being built on, the number of people consuming agriculture products is going up. Ethanol is also responsible for using much more of the corn that is grown here in the U.S. The production of this fuel has put a strain on the corn market. Prices of corn have gone up and this price is having a negative impact on the people who feed animals using corn. The combination of reduced acres of farmland and a higher demand on crops have left producers and consumers in a severe dilemma. The only solution to this problem is to keep getting higher and higher yields from the cropland that we have left.

Genetically modified plants are a good answer to the problem of not enough crops to go around. These plants can be engineered to be resistant to all types of abiotic stress. This would eliminate [[crop yield]] loss due to extreme temperatures, drought, wind, or salinity. The consumers of crops would enjoy a little bit lower prices because the demand on them would be a little lower.

The [[Midwest]]ern U.S. is experiencing a severe drought. Farmers are being limited on how much they can irrigate due to the shortage of water. There is also very little rain during the growing season so the crops do not yield very well. This problem could be solved by genetically modifying plants to become more drought resistant. If plants could use less water and produce yields that are superior or equal to current ones, it would be better for the people and also the environment. People would enjoy an abundance of crops to consume and export for a profit. The environment would be able to have more water in its aquifers and rivers throughout the country.

Another environmental factor that would be improved would be the amount of land left for [[wildlife]]. Crops modified to be resistant to abiotic stress and other factors that decrease yields would require less land use. Producers would be able to grow enough crops on less acres if the plants were modified to produce very high yields. This would allow some of the cropland that is in use today to be set aside for wildlife. Instead of farming “fence line to fence line” farmers would be able to create large buffers in their fields. These buffers would provide a great habitat for plants and animals.

A lot of people do not like genetically modified organisms. People opposed to these modified plants often claim that they are not safe for the environment or for human consumption. There are many videos and reports in circulation that discredit the safety of genetically modified organisms. [[King Corn (film)|King Corn]] is one video that claims that corn is bad for humans to consume.

There are strict regulations and protocols that go along with genetically modifying plants. A company that specializes in producing genetically modifying organisms must put their plants through a huge variety of tests to ensure the safety of their product. Each of these tests must be passed by the product in order to produce more of the plant seeds.

When seeds are mass-produced, the fields that they are grown in have to meet specific criteria. They must have no vegetation zones around them to prevent the spread of the modified plants into the native population. The plots must be carefully labeled and marked so that the company knows exactly what is planted in the field. All of these protocols are in place to ensure the safety of the consumers and also of the environment.
Because genetically modified plants are given stress resistant genes or high yielding genes they are better for the environment. They only help create more land to be put back into natural habitats for plants and animals.

== Conclusion ==
Abiotic stress is a naturally occurring factor that cannot be controlled by humans. One example of two stressors that are complimentary to each other is wind and drought. Drought dries out the soil and kills the plants that are growing in the soil. After this occurs, the soil is left barren and dry. Wind can pick up the soil and carry for miles. Irrigation can keep this from happening, but it is not possible to irrigate some areas.

Genetically modified plants can be implemented to slow down the effects of the abiotic stressors. This allows more crops to be grown on a smaller amount of land. Less need for farmland allows some of it to be set aside for natural wildlife habitat.

Abiotic stress only poses a problem to people or the environment if they are not prepared for it. There can be steps taken by humans to lessen the effects. Plants and animals have the ability to adapt to abiotic stress over time.

The '''OER4Schools''' programme is a teacher professional development programme utilizing [[information and communication technologies]] (ICT), focussing on [[sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The OER4Schools Professional Learning Resource|url=http://oer.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/OER4Schools|work=University of Cambridge: Faculty of Education|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initiated at the Centre for Commonwealth Education,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/centres/archive/cce/&lt;/ref&gt; based at the [[Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge]]. Aspects of the OER4Schools project are developed in conjunction with [[OER Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=African Teacher Education OER Network|url=http://www.oerafrica.org/african-teacher-education-oer-network-aten/about-african-teacher-education-network|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phase 1 (Pilot)==

The OER4Schools programme started in August 2009 with a pilot phase, that was completed in May 2010. Through this pilot, the programme assessed the feasibility of providing [[Open Educational Resources]] (OER) to ICT- and Internet-equipped primary schools in [[Zambia]], and of supporting interactive forms of subject pedagogy with the new resources. It identified the needs of school-based professional development adapted to the local context. The programme is conducted in a North-South partnership between the CCE and institutions in Zambia. It combines stakeholders from various sectors (including educational research, ICT for development [NGOs], government, and the ICT service sector) as a basis for developing methodologies that promise lasting transformation in Zambian primary education. While the project is conducted in Zambia, it is anticipated to be relevant to a wide range of countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Key outputs include models for OER-Pedagogy-ICT adoption in poorly resourced educational systems, and guidance on implementing better learning environments.

In the pilot phase the primary aim of the project was to conduct the necessary research to build a further proposal for external funding over a longer period. We worked with teachers in 3 schools, developing, supporting and trialling uses of OERs combined with new pedagogical approaches for teaching mathematics. There were opportunities for peer observation and reflective practice. The research element recorded classroom practice and assessed participants' reactions and learning, eliciting messages for embedding basic ICT and OER use in teacher education. Findings were presented at the [[eLearning Africa]] Conference in Lusaka in May 2010.

== Phase 2 (2010-2012) ==

The second phase started in June 2010, and draws on outcomes of the pilot phase. We developed a professional learning resource for teachers and student teachers, focussing on interactive teaching and learning - with and without ICT. A key element of this resource is the use of unique video clips illustrating interactive practice (produced in Zambian and South African primary classroom contexts) as a stimulus for discussion.

The resource is freely available for re-use under a [[Creative Commons license]].{{which|date=February 2014}} It supports different modes of learning, including collaborative and individual use, as well as blended learning as part of a course. It will be available in a number of formats, appropriate to the varied African environments in which teachers find themselves. It is being embedded in various teacher education and professional development courses administered by teacher colleges and universities in Zambia and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa; "taster workshops" have been run successfully with lecturers and students in three higher education settings.

The second phase culminated in trialling the resource with all teachers in Grade 4 to 6 at Chalimbana Basic School throughout 2012. A Zambian teacher facilitated regular workshops with his colleagues.

== Phase 3 (2013-2014) ==

In the third phase (2013), the programme has now broadened to all grades at the school, involving all 35 teachers and all pupils (around 1,000). Workshops are again being facilitated by teachers who participated in earlier phases, leading colleagues (Grades 1-9) through regular teacher group meetings using the resource. Research questions included: What forms of stimulus and support are most effective in developing more interactive pedagogy? What changes took place? What were the supporting and constraining factors? Research methods included audio diaries, lesson and workshop observations, video recording and teacher interviews.

== The OER4Schools professional learning resource ==

The OER4Schools programme developed a professional learning resource that can be used in [[pre-service teacher education|pre-service]] or [[inservice program|in-service]] teacher education by groups of teachers working together and ultimately sharing practices with others. The resource supports interactive teaching and active, collaborative learning – generally, and through using mobile technologies (tablets, netbooks, e-book readers etc.), digital open educational resources (OER) and Open Source software – as appropriate for teachers’ own purposes and settings.

The professional learning programme is suitable for low-resourced primary schools and teacher colleges (combined with teaching practice), and freely available as an OER. It consists of 25 two-hour sessions, organised in five units, covering interactive teaching principles, group work, questioning, dialogue, Assessment for Learning, and enquiry-based learning. Each session includes unique, professionally filmed video exemplars of interactive practices in Zambian and South African classrooms (with and without technology), accompanying texts, practical activities and facilitator notes. It is based on an established process for teacher-led discussion, trialling new ideas, peer observation and joint reflection, all stimulated and guided by the professional development materials. The overall goal is to focus on learning, meeting the challenge of moving away from superficial repetition of facts towards [[w:Deeper_Learning|deeper learning]] and understanding. The materials have been participatively developed in conjunction with local stakeholders, including teachers, teacher college lecturers and other partners.

The resources are hosted using [[MediaWiki]] and are also available as ZIM files (using [[Kiwix]]).

{{One source|date=November 2010}}

'''Paleosalinity''' (or palaeosalinity) is the salinity of the global ocean or of an [[ocean basin]] at a point in geological history.

== Importance ==
From [[Bjerrum plot]]s, it is found that a decrease in the salinity of an aqueous fluid will act to increase the value of the carbon dioxide-carbonate system equilibrium constants, (pK*). This means that the relative proportion of [[carbonate]] with respect to [[carbon dioxide]] is higher in more saline fluids, e.g. [[seawater]], than in fresher waters. Of crucial importance for [[paleoclimatology]] is the observation that an increase in [[salinity]] will thus reduce the [[solubility]] of carbon dioxide in the oceans. Since there is thought to have been a 120&amp;nbsp;m depression in [[sea level]] at the [[last glacial maximum]] due to the extensive formation of [[ice sheet]]s (which are solely freshwater), this represents a significant fractionation towards saltier seas during glacial periods. Correspondingly, this will cause a net [[outgassing]] of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere because of its reduced solubility, acting to increase atmospheric carbon dioxide by 6.5[[permille|‰]]. This is thought to partly offset the net decrease of 80-100‰ observed during glacial periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Glacial/interglacial variations in Carbon Dioxide | journal = Nature | first = D.M. | last = Sigman | author2 = E.A. Boyle | volume = 407 | id =  | url = http://www.up.ethz.ch/education/biogeochem_cycles/reading_list/sigman_nat_00.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-05-17 | pmid = 11057657 | doi = 10.1038/35038000 | year = 2000 | issue = 6806 | pages = 859–869 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120224034604/http://www.up.ethz.ch/education/biogeochem_cycles/reading_list/sigman_nat_00.pdf | archivedate = 2012-02-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stratification ===
In addition, it is thought that extensive salinity stratification can lead to a reduction in the [[meridional overturning circulation]] (MOC) through the slowing of [[thermohaline circulation]]. Increased stratification means that there is effectively a barrier to subduction of parcels of water; [[isopycnal]]s effectively do not outcrop at the surface and are parallel to the surface. The ocean, in this case, can be described as "less ventilated", and this has been implicated in the slowing down of the MOC.

== Measuring paleosalinity ==
There may exist proxies for salinity, but to date the main way that salinity has been measured has been by directly measuring [[chlorinity]] in [[pore fluid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1076252 | title = The Salinity, Temperature, and delta 18O of the Glacial Deep Ocean | journal = Science | first = J.F. | last = Adkins | author2 = McIntyre, K. | author3 = Schrag, D.P. | volume = 298 | issue = 5599 | pages = 1769–73 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12459585 | id =  | url = http://schraglab.unix.fas.harvard.edu/publications/CV49.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-05-17 | bibcode = 2002Sci...298.1769A | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719204446/http://schraglab.unix.fas.harvard.edu/publications/CV49.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adkins et al. (2002) used pore fluid chlorinity in [[Ocean Drilling Program|ODP]] cores, with the paleo-depth estimated from nearby coral horizons. Chlorinity was measured rather than pure salinity because the major ions in seawater are not constant with depth in the sediment column; for example, sulfate reduction and cation-clay interactions can change overall salinity, whereas chlorinity is not heavily affected.

== Paleosalinity during the Last Glacial Maximum ==
Adkins' study found that global salinity increased with a global sea level drop of 120&amp;nbsp;m. Analyzing &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O data they also found that deep waters were within error of the freezing point, with oceanic waters exhibiting a greater degree of homogeneity in temperatures. In contrast, variations in salinity were much greater than they are today. Modern day salinities are all within 0.5&amp;nbsp;[[Practical salinity unit|psu]] of the global average salinity of 34.7&amp;nbsp;psu, whereas salinities during the [[last glacial maximum]] (LGM) ranged from 35.8&amp;nbsp;psu in the North Atlantic to 37.1 in the Southern Ocean.

There are some notable differences in the hydrography at the LGM and present day. Today the [[North Atlantic Deep Water]] (NADW) is observed to be more saline than [[Antarctic Bottom Water]] (AABW), whereas at the last glacial maximum it was observed that the AABW was in fact more saline; a complete reversal. Today the NADW is more salty because of the [[Gulf Stream]]; this could thus indicate a reduction of flow through the [[Florida Strait]]s due to lowered sea level.

Another observation is that the Southern Ocean was vastly more salty at the LGM than today. This is particularly intriguing given the assumed importance of the [[Southern Ocean]] in oceanic dynamical regulation of ice ages. The extreme value of 37.1&amp;nbsp;psu is assumed to be a consequence of an increased degree of [[sea ice]] formation and export. This would account for the increased salinity, but would also account for the lack of oxygen [[isotopic fractionation]]; [[brine]] rejection without oxygen isotopic fractionation is thought to be highly characteristic of sea ice formation.

=== The increased role of salinity ===
The presence of waters near the freezing point alters the balance of the relative effects of contrasts in salinity and temperature on sea water density. This is described in the equation,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta\rho}{\rho}=\alpha\Delta T-\beta\Delta S&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermal expansion coefficient]] and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[haline contraction coefficient]]. In particular, the ratio &lt;math&gt;\frac{\beta}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is crucial. Using the observed temperatures and salinities, in the modern ocean, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\beta}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is about 10 whilst at the LGM &lt;math&gt;\frac{\beta}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; it is estimated to have been closer to 25. The modern [[thermohaline circulation]] is thus more controlled by density contrasts due to thermal differences, whereas during the LGM the oceans were more than twice as sensitive to differences in salinity rather than temperature. In this way, the thermohaline circulation can be considered to have been less "thermo" and more "haline".

The term '''physiological prematurity''' refers to the fact that compared to most animals, humans are born in a premature biological state. Although [[sensory organs]] and skeletal and muscular systems are largely developed prenatally, human babies at the time of their [[birth]] are completely helpless and dependent on intensive care. This is in contrast to the maturity at birth found in other higher [[mammals]] (e.g. elephants, horses). 
According to the Swiss biologist [[Adolf Portmann]], it is a characteristic feature of humans that due to their early birth, many developmental processes do not happen in isolation, but embedded in a sociocultural environment. Due to their complete dependence, humans are particularly amenable for social interactions and their environmental condition, which, according to Portmann, is a precondition for cultural and intellectual learning.

Automatic '''process control''' in [[Continuous production|continuous production processes]] is a combination of [[control engineering]] and [[chemical engineering]] disciplines that uses [[industrial control system]]s  to achieve a production level of consistency, economy and safety which could not be achieved purely by human manual control. It is implemented widely in industries such as oil refining, pulp and paper manufacturing, chemical processing and power generating  plants.

There is a wide range of size, type and complexity, but it enables a small number of operators to manage complex processes to a high degree of consistency. The development of large automatic process control systems was instrumental in enabling the design of large high volume and complex processes, which could not be otherwise economically or safely operated.

The applications can range from controlling the temperature and level of a single process vessel, to a complete chemical processing plant with several thousand [[control loop]]s.

==History==
Early process control breakthroughs came most frequently in the form of water control devices. Ktesibios of Alexandria is credited for inventing float valves to regulate water level of water clocks in the 3rd Century BC. In the 1st Century AD, Heron of Alexandria invented a water valve similar to the fill valve used in modern toilets.&lt;ref name="Young etal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=William Y|last2=Svrcek|first2=Donald P|last3=Mahoney|first3=Brent R|title=A Real Time Approach to Process Control|date=2014|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.|location=Chichester, West Sussex, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1119993872|pages=1–2|edition=3|chapter=1: A Brief History of Control and Simulation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later process controls inventions involved basic physics principles. In 1620, Cornlis Drebbel invented a bimetallic thermostat for controlling the temperature in a furnace. In 1681, Denis Papin discovered the pressure inside a vessel could be regulated by placing weights on top of the vessel lid.&lt;ref name = 'Young etal'/&gt; In 1745, Edmund Lee created the fantail to improve windmill efficiency; a fantail was a smaller windmill placed 90° of the larger fans to keep the face of the windmill pointed directly into the oncoming wind.

With the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in the 1760s, process controls inventions were aimed to replace human operators with mechanized processes.  In 1784, Oliver Evans created a water-powered flourmill which operated using buckets and screw conveyors. Henry Ford applied the same theory in 1910 when the assembly line was created to decrease human intervention in the automobile production process.&lt;ref name = 'Young etal'/&gt;

For continuously variable process control it was not until 1922 that a formal control law for what we now call [[PID control]] or three-term control was first developed using theoretical analysis, by [[Russian American]] engineer [[Nicolas Minorsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Minorsky |first=Nicolas |authorlink=Nicolas Minorsky |title=Directional stability of automatically steered bodies |journal=J. Amer. Soc. Naval Eng. |year=1922 |volume=34 |pages=280–309 |issue=2 |ref=harv |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt; |doi=10.1111/j.1559-3584.1922.tb04958.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minorsky was researching and designing automatic ship steering for the US Navy and based his analysis on observations of a [[helmsman]]. He noted the helmsman steered the ship based not only on the current course error, but also on past error, as well as the current rate of change;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|1993|loc = [https://books.google.com/books?id=VD_b81J3yFoC&amp;pg=PA67 p. 67]}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was then given a mathematical treatment by Minorsky.&lt;ref name="ben96"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His goal was stability, not general control, which simplified the problem significantly. While proportional control provided stability against small disturbances, it was insufficient for dealing with a steady disturbance, notably a stiff gale (due to [[#Steady-state error|steady-state error]]), which required adding the integral term. Finally, the derivative term was added to improve stability and control.

==Development of modern process control operations==
[[File:Leitstand 2.jpg|alt=|thumb|A modern control room where plant information and controls are displayed on computer graphics screens. The operators are seated as they can view and control any part of the process from their screens, whilst retaining a plant overview.]]
Process control of large industrial plants has evolved through many stages. Initially, control would be from panels local to the process plant. However this required a large manpower resource to attend to these dispersed panels, and there was no overall view of the process. The next logical development was the transmission of all plant measurements to a permanently-manned central control room. Effectively this was the centralisation of all the localised panels, with the advantages of lower manning levels and easier overview of the process. Often the controllers were behind the control room panels, and all automatic and manual control outputs were transmitted back to plant. However, whilst providing a central control focus, this arrangement was inflexible as each control loop had its own controller hardware, and continual operator movement within the control room was required to view different parts of the process.

With the coming of electronic processors and graphic displays it became possible to replace these discrete controllers with computer-based algorithms, hosted on a network of input/output racks with their own control processors. These could be distributed around plant, and communicate with the graphic display in the control room or rooms. The distributed control system was born.

The introduction of DCSs allowed easy interconnection and re-configuration of plant controls such as cascaded loops and interlocks, and easy interfacing with other production computer systems. It enabled sophisticated alarm handling, introduced automatic event logging, removed the need for physical records such as chart recorders, allowed the control racks to be networked and thereby located locally to plant to reduce cabling runs, and provided high level overviews of plant status and production levels.

==Hierarchy==
[[File:Functional levels of a Distributed Control System.svg|thumb|500px|Functional levels of a manufacturing control operation.]]
The accompanying diagram is a general model which shows functional manufacturing levels in a large process using processor and computer-based control.

Referring to the diagram;

* Level 0 contains the field devices such as flow and temperature sensors (process value readings - PV), and final control elements (FCE), such as [[control valve]]s
* Level 1 contains the industrialised Input/Output (I/O) modules, and their associated distributed electronic processors.   
* Level 2 contains the supervisory computers, which  collate information from processor nodes on the system, and provide the operator control screens. 
* Level 3 is the production control level, which does not directly control the process, but is concerned with monitoring production and monitoring targets
* Level 4 is the production scheduling level.

==Control model==

To determine the fundamental model for any process, the inputs and outputs of the system are defined differently than for other chemical processes.&lt;ref name="Bequette"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bequette|first1=B. Wayne|title=Process control: Modeling, Design, and Simulation|date=2003|publisher=Prentice Hall PTR|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=978-0133536409|pages=57–58|edition=Prentice-Hall International series in the physical and chemical engineering science.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The balance equations are defined by the control inputs and outputs rather than the material inputs. The control model is a set of equations used to predict the behavior of a system and can help determine what the response to change will be.

*State Variable (x) - This is a measurable variable that is a good indicator of the state of the system, such as temperature (energy balance), volume (mass balance) or concentration (component balance). 
*Input Variable (u) - This is a specified variable that commonly include flow rates. It's important to note that the entering and exiting flows are both considered control inputs. The control input can be classified as a manipulated, disturbance, or unmonitored variable.
*Parameters (p) - The parameters are usually a physical limitation and something that is fixed for the system, such as the vessel volume or the viscosity of the material.
*Output (y) - The output is the metric used to determine the behavior of the system. The control output can be classified as measured, unmeasured, or unmonitored.

==Types==
Processes can be characterized as one or more of the following forms:

*Batch –  Some applications require that specific quantities of raw materials be combined in specific ways for particular duration to produce an intermediate or end result.  One example is the production of adhesives and glues, which normally require the mixing of raw materials in a heated vessel for a period of time to form a quantity of end product. Other important examples are the production of food, beverages and medicine. Batch processes are generally used to produce a relatively low to intermediate quantity of product per year (a few pounds to millions of pounds).
*Continuous – Often, a physical system is represented through variables that are smooth and uninterrupted in time.  The control of the water temperature in a heating jacket, for example, is an example of continuous process control. Some important continuous processes are the production of fuels, chemicals and plastics. Continuous processes in manufacturing are used to produce very large quantities of product per year (millions to billions of pounds). Such controls use [[feedback control|feedback]] such as in the [[PID controller]] A PID Controller includes proportional, integrating, and derivative controller functions.
*Hybrid - Applications having elements of batch and continuous process control are often called ''hybrid'' applications.

==Control loops==
[[File:Smart current loop positioner.png|thumb|Example of a continuous flow control loop. Signalling is by industry standard 4-20 mA current loops, and a "smart" [[control valve|valve positioner]] ensures the [[control valve]] operates correctly.]]
The fundamental building block of any industrial control system is the [[control loop]], which controls just one process variable. An example is shown in the accompanying diagram, where the flow rate in a pipe is controlled by a PID controller, assisted by what is effectively a cascaded loop in the form of a valve servo-controller to ensure correct valve positioning.

Some large systems may have several hundreds or thousands of control loops. In complex processes the loops are interactive, so that the operation of one loop may affect the operation of another. The system diagram for representing control loops is a [[Piping and instrumentation diagram]].

Commonly used controllers are [[programmable logic controller]] (PLC), [[Distributed Control System]] (DCS) or [[SCADA]].

[[File:Auxostat schematic.svg|thumb|Example of level control system of a [[continuous stirred-tank reactor]]. The flow control into the tank would be cascaded off the level control. ]]

A further example is shown. If a control valve were used to hold level in a tank, the level controller would compare the equivalent reading of a level sensor to the level setpoint and determine whether more or less valve opening was necessary to keep the level constant. A cascaded flow controller could then calculate the change in the valve position.

==Economic advantages==
The economic nature of many products manufactured in batch and continuous processes require highly efficient operation due to thin margins. The competing factor in process control is that products must meet certain specifications in order to be satisfactory. These specifications can come in two forms: a minimum and maximum for a property of the material or product, or a range within which the property must be.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=C L|title=Process Control for the Process Industries - Part 2: Steady State Characteristics|journal=Chemical Engineering Progress|date=March 2017|pages=67–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; All loops are susceptible to disturbances and therefore a buffer must be used on process set points to ensure disturbances do not cause the material or product to go out of specifications. This buffer comes at an economic cost (i.e. additional processing, maintaining elevated or depressed process conditions, etc.).

Process efficiency can be enhanced by reducing the margins necessary to ensure product specifications are met.&lt;ref name =smith/&gt; This can be done by improving the control of the process to minimize the effect of disturbances on the process. The efficiency is improved in a two step method of narrowing the variance and shifting the target.&lt;ref name =smith/&gt; Margins can be narrowed through various process upgrades (i.e. equipment upgrades, enhanced control methods, etc.). Once margins are narrowed, an economic analysis can be done on the process to determine how the set point target is to be shifted. Less conservative process set points lead to increased economic efficiency.&lt;ref name = smith/&gt; Effective process control strategies increase the competitive advantage of manufacturers who employ them.

[[File:Race condition.svg|frame|Race condition in a logic circuit. Here, ∆''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ∆''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represent the [[propagation delay]]s of the logic elements. When the input value ''A'' changes from low to high, the circuit outputs a short spike of duration (∆''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ∆''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) − ∆''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ∆''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

A '''race condition''' or '''race hazard''' is the behavior of an [[electronics]], [[software]], or other [[system]] where the output is dependent on the sequence or timing of other uncontrollable events. It becomes a [[software bug|bug]] when events do not happen in the order the programmer intended.

The term '''race condition''' was already in use by 1954, for example in [[David A. Huffman]]'s doctoral thesis "The synthesis of sequential switching circuits". &lt;ref&gt;Huffman, David A. "The synthesis of sequential switching circuits." (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;

Race conditions can occur especially in [[logic gate|logic circuits]], [[thread (computing)|multithreaded]] or [[distributed computing|distributed]] software programs.

==Electronics==
A typical example of a race condition may occur when a [[logic gate]] combines signals that have traveled along different paths from the same source. The inputs to the gate can change at slightly different times in response to a change in the source signal. The output may, for a brief period, change to an unwanted state before settling back to the designed state. Certain systems can tolerate such [[glitch]]es but if this output functions as a [[clock signal]] for further systems that contain memory, for example, the system can rapidly depart from its designed behaviour (in effect, the temporary glitch becomes a permanent glitch).

Consider, for example, a two-input [[AND gate]] fed with a logic signal A on one input and its negation, NOT A, on another input. In theory the output (A AND NOT A) should never be true. If, however, changes in the value of A take longer to propagate to the second input than the first when A changes from false to true then a brief period will ensue during which both inputs are true, and so the gate's output will also be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=S.H. |last=Unger |title=Hazards, Critical Races, and Metastability |journal=IEEE Transactions on Computers |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=754–768 |date=June 1995 |doi=10.1109/12.391185 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=391185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design techniques such as [[Karnaugh map]]s encourage designers to recognize and eliminate race conditions before they cause problems. Often [[logic redundancy]] can be added to eliminate some kinds of races.

As well as these problems, some logic elements can enter [[metastability (electronics)|metastable states]], which create further problems for circuit designers.

===Critical and non-critical forms===
A ''critical race condition'' occurs when the order in which internal variables are changed determines the eventual state that the [[finite-state machine|state machine]] will end up in.

A ''non-critical race condition'' occurs when the order in which internal variables are changed does not determine the eventual state that the state machine will end up in.

===Static, dynamic, and essential forms===
A ''static race condition'' occurs when a signal and its complement are combined together.

A ''dynamic race condition'' occurs when it results in multiple transitions when only one is intended. They are due to interaction between gates. It can be eliminated by using no more than two levels of gating.

An ''essential race condition'' occurs when an input has two transitions in less than the total feedback propagation time. Sometimes they are cured using inductive [[analog delay line|delay line]] elements to effectively increase the time duration of an input signal.

==Software==
Race conditions arise in software when an application depends on the sequence or timing of [[process (computing)|processes]] or [[thread (computing)|threads]] for it to operate properly. As with electronics, there are critical race conditions that result in invalid execution and [[software bug|bugs]]. Critical race conditions often happen when the processes or threads depend on some shared state. Operations upon shared states are [[critical section]]s that must be [[mutual exclusion|mutually exclusive]]. Failure to obey this rule opens up the possibility of corrupting the shared state.

The [[memory model (programming)|memory model]] defined in the [[C11 (C standard revision)|C11]] and [[C++11]] standards uses the term "data race" for a race condition caused by potentially concurrent operations on a shared memory location, of which at least one is a write. A C or C++ program containing a data race has [[undefined behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=57853 |title=ISO/IEC 9899:2011 - Information technology - Programming languages - C |publisher=Iso.org |date= |accessdate=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authorlink= ISO |title= ISO/IEC 14882:2011 |publisher= ISO |date= 2 September 2011 |url= http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50372 |accessdate= 3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Race conditions have a reputation of being difficult to reproduce and debug, since the end result is [[nondeterministic algorithm|nondeterministic]] and depends on the relative timing between interfering threads. Problems occurring in production systems can therefore disappear when running in debug mode, when additional logging is added, or when attaching a debugger, often referred to as a "[[Heisenbug]]". It is therefore better to avoid race conditions by careful software design rather than attempting to fix them afterwards.

===Example===
As a simple example, let us assume that two threads want to increment the value of a global integer variable by one. Ideally, the following sequence of operations would take place:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
! Thread 1 !! Thread 2 !! !! Integer value
|-
|   ||   ||  || 0
|-
| read value ||   || ← || 0
|-
| style="background: wheat;" | increase value ||  || || 0
|-
| write back ||  || → || 1
|-
| || read value   || ← || 1
|-
| || style="background: wheat;" | increase value || || 1
|-
| || write back || → || 2
|}

In the case shown above, the final value is 2, as expected. However, if the two threads run simultaneously without locking or synchronization, the outcome of the operation could be wrong. The alternative sequence of operations below demonstrates this scenario:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
! Thread 1 !! Thread 2 !! !! Integer value
|-
|   ||   ||  || 0
|-
| read value ||   || ← || 0
|-
| || read value || ← || 0
|-
| style="background: wheat;" | increase value ||  ||  || 0
|-
| || style="background: wheat;" | increase value  ||  || 0
|-
| write back ||  || → || 1
|-
| || write back || → || 1
|}

In this case, the final value is 1 instead of the expected result of 2. This occurs because here the increment operations are not [[mutually exclusive]]. Mutually exclusive operations are those that cannot be interrupted while accessing some resource such as a memory location.

===Computer security===
Many software race conditions have associated [[computer security]] implications. A race condition allows an attacker with access to a shared resource to cause other actors that utilize that resource to malfunction, resulting in effects including [[Denial-of-service attack|denial of service]]&lt;ref name="CVE-2015-8461"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01319/0/CVE-2015-8461%3A-A-race-condition-when-handling-socket-errors-can-lead-to-an-assertion-failure-in-resolver.c.html|title=CVE-2015-8461: A race condition when handling socket errors can lead to an assertion failure in resolver.c|accessdate=5 June 2017|publisher=[[Internet Systems Consortium]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[privilege escalation]].&lt;ref name="CVE-2017-6512" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lighttpd-issue-2724"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://redmine.lighttpd.net/issues/2724|publisher=[[lighttpd]]|accessdate=5 June 2017|title=security: stat cache *very large* race condition if caching when follow_symlink disabled}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A specific kind of race condition involves checking for a predicate (e.g. for [[authentication]]), then acting on the predicate, while the state can change between the ''time of check'' and the ''time of use''. When this kind of [[computer bug|bug]] exists in security-sensitive code, a [[security vulnerability]] called a [[time-of-check-to-time-of-use]] (''TOCTTOU'') bug is created.

Race conditions are also intentionally used to create [[hardware random number generator]]s and [[physically unclonable function]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} PUFs can be created by designing circuit topologies with identical paths to a node and relying on manufacturing variations to randomly determine which paths will complete first. By measuring each manufactured circuit's specific set of race condition outcomes, a profile can be collected for each circuit and kept secret in order to later verify a circuit's identity.

===File systems===
Two or more programs may collide in their attempts to modify or access a file system, which can result in data corruption or privilege escalation.&lt;ref name="CVE-2017-6512"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=121951|accessdate=5 June 2017|title=Vulnerability in rmtree() and remove_tree(): CVE-2017-6512|publisher=[[CPAN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File locking]] provides a commonly used solution. A more cumbersome remedy involves organizing the system in such a way that one unique process (running a [[daemon (computing)|daemon]] or the like) has exclusive access to the file, and all other processes that need to access the data in that file do so only via interprocess communication with that one process. This requires synchronization at the process level.

A different form of race condition exists in file systems where unrelated programs may affect each other by suddenly using up available resources such as disk space, memory space, or processor cycles. Software not carefully designed to anticipate and handle this race situation may then become unpredictable. Such a risk may be overlooked for a long time in a system that seems very reliable. But eventually enough data may accumulate or enough other software may be added to critically destabilize many parts of a system. An example of this occurred with the near loss of the [[Spirit (rover)#Sol 17 (January 21, 2004) flash memory management anomaly|Mars Rover "Spirit"]] not long after landing. A solution is for software to request and reserve all the resources it will need before beginning a task; if this request fails then the task is postponed, avoiding the many points where failure could have occurred. Alternatively, each of those points can be equipped with error handling, or the success of the entire task can be verified afterwards, before continuing. A more common approach is to simply verify that enough system resources are available before starting a task; however, this may not be adequate because in complex systems the actions of other running programs can be unpredictable.

===Networking===
In networking, consider a distributed chat network like [[IRC]], where a user who starts a channel automatically acquires channel-operator privileges. If two users on different servers, on different ends of the same network, try to start the same-named channel at the same time, each user's respective server will grant channel-operator privileges to each user, since neither server will yet have received the other server's signal that it has allocated that channel. (This problem has been largely [[Internet Relay Chat#Abuse prevention|solved]] by various IRC server implementations.)

In this case of a race condition, the concept of the "[[shared resource]]" covers the state of the network (what channels exist, as well as what users started them and therefore have what privileges), which each server can freely change as long as it signals the other servers on the network about the changes so that they can update their conception of the state of the network. However, the [[latency (engineering)|latency]] across the network makes possible the kind of race condition described. In this case, heading off race conditions by imposing a form of control over access to the shared resource—say, appointing one server to control who holds what privileges—would mean turning the distributed network into a centralized one (at least for that one part of the network operation).

Race conditions can also exist when a computer program is written with [[Berkeley sockets#Blocking vs. non-blocking mode|non-blocking sockets]], in which case the performance of the program can be dependent on the speed of the network link.

===Life-critical systems===
Software flaws in [[life-critical system]]s can be disastrous. Race conditions were among the flaws in the [[Therac-25]] [[radiation therapy]] machine, which led to the death of at least three patients and injuries to several more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs3604/lib/Therac_25/Therac_1.html |title=An Investigation of Therac-25 Accidents — I |publisher=Courses.cs.vt.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the Energy Management System provided by [[GE Energy]] and used by [[Ohio]]-based [[FirstEnergy Corp]] (among other power facilities). A race condition existed in the alarm subsystem; when three sagging power lines were tripped simultaneously, the condition prevented alerts from being raised to the monitoring technicians, delaying their awareness of the problem. This software flaw eventually led to the [[2003 North America blackout|North American Blackout of 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kevin Poulsen |url=http://www.securityfocus.com/news/8412 |title=Tracking the blackout bug |publisher=Securityfocus.com |date=2004-04-07 |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; GE Energy later developed a software patch to correct the previously undiscovered error.

==Examples outside of computing==

===Biology===
{{Expand section|date=October 2016}}

Neuroscience is demonstrating that race conditions can occur in mammal (rat) brains as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2013-08-03 |title=How Brains Race to Cancel Errant Movements |publisher=Discover Magazine blogs |url=https://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2013/08/03/the-race-to-stop-an-errant-movement/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/nn.3456|title= Canceling actions involves a race between basal ganglia pathways|year= 2013|last1= Schmidt|first1= Robert|last2= Leventhal|first2= Daniel K|last3= Mallet|first3= Nicolas|last4= Chen|first4= Fujun|last5= Berke|first5= Joshua D|journal= Nature Neuroscience|volume= 16|issue= 8|pages= 1118–24|pmid= 23852117|pmc= 3733500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==

Many software tools exist to help detect race conditions in software. They can be largely categorized into two groups: [[static program analysis|static analysis]] tools and [[dynamic program analysis|dynamic analysis]] tools.

Thread Safety Analysis is a static analysis tool for annotation-based intra-procedural static analysis, originally implemented as a branch of gcc, and now reimplemented in [[Clang]], supporting PThreads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thread Safety Analysis|url=http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=December 2016}}

Dynamic analysis tools include: [[Intel Inspector]], a memory and thread checking and debugging tool to increase the reliability, security, and accuracy of C/C++ and Fortran applications; [[Intel Advisor]], a sampling based, SIMD vectorization optimization and shared memory threading assistance tool for C, C++, C#, and Fortran software developers and architects; ThreadSanitizer, which uses binary ([[Valgrind]]-based) or source, [[LLVM]]-based instrumentation, and supports PThreads);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=THREADSANITIZER|url=http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=December 2016}} and Helgrind, a [[Valgrind]] tool for detecting synchronisation errors in C, C++ and Fortran programs that use the POSIX pthreads threading primitives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Helgrind: a thread error detector|url=http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/hg-manual.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=December 2016}}

'''Scanimate''' is the name for an analog [[computer animation]] ([[video synthesizer]]) system developed from the late 1960s to the 1980s by [[Computer Image Corporation]] of [[Denver]], [[Colorado]].

The 8 Scanimate systems were used to produce much of the [[video]]-based animation seen on [[television]] between most of the 1970s and early 1980s in commercials, promotions, and show openings. One of the major advantages the Scanimate system had over [[film]]-based animation and computer animation was the ability to create animations in [[Real-time computer graphics|real time]]. The speed with which animation could be produced on the system because of this, as well as its range of possible effects, helped it to supersede film-based animation techniques for television graphics. By the mid-1980s, it was superseded by digital [[computer animation]], which produced sharper images and more sophisticated 3D imagery.

Animations created on Scanimate and similar analog computer animation systems have a number of characteristic features that distinguish them from film-based animation: The motion is extremely fluid, using all 60 fields per second (in [[NTSC]] format video) or 50 fields (in [[PAL]] format video) rather than the 24 frames per second that film uses; the colors are much brighter and more saturated; and the images have a very "electronic" look that results from the direct manipulation of video signals through which the Scanimate produces the images.

==How it works==
A special high-resolution (around 800 lines) monochrome camera records high-contrast artwork. The image is then displayed on a high-resolution screen. Unlike a normal monitor, its deflection signals are passed through a special analog computer that enables the operator to bend the image in a variety of ways. The image is then shot from the screen by either a film camera or a video camera. In the case of a video camera this signal is then fed into a colorizer, a device that takes certain shades of grey and turns it into color as well as transparency. The idea behind this is that the output of the Scanimate itself is always monochrome. Another advantage of the colorizer is that it gives the operator the ability to continuously add layers of graphics. This makes possible the creation of very complex graphics. This is done by using two video recorders. The background is played by one recorder and then recorded by another one. This process is repeated for every layer. This requires very high-quality video recorders (such as both the [[Ampex]] [[Quadruplex videotape|VR-2000]] or [[International Video Corporation|IVC]]'s [[IVC videotape format|IVC-9000]] of Scanimate's era, the IVC-9000 being used quite frequently for Scanimate composition due to its very high generational quality between re-recordings).

==Scanimate today==
Two of the Scanimates are still in use at [[ZFx studios]] in Asheville, NC.  The original "Black Swan" R&amp;D machine has been updated with more modern power supplies and can produce material in standard or 1080P high definition video.  The "white Pearl" machine is the last one produced and is being kept in its original configuration for historical purposes by David Sieg at ZFx inc.  The machines are installed in a working production environment with Grass Valley switchers, Kaleidascope effects systems and Accom digital disk recorders for layering.

A '''science project''' is an [[education]]al activity for students involving [[experiment]]s or construction of models in one of the science disciplines. Students may present their science project at a [[science fair]], so they may also call it a science fair project. Science projects may be classified into four main types. Science projects are done by students worldwide.

==Experimental projects==

Experimental projects, also known as investigatory projects, start with a question (AKA a hypothesis), use the [[scientific method]] to complete the research, and end with a report detailing the results and conclusions and an abstract.

==Engineering projects==

Engineering projects, also known as technology projects, start with a design of a machine or mechanical structure with the purpose of improving strength or performance. Researchers implement all their design ideas in a model they construct. The model will be tested to evaluate the design.

==Display projects==
[[File:Guatemalan Boy and His Science Project.jpg|alt=A boy holding a three-dimensional display of the planets in the solar system|thumb|This student is carrying his science project to school.]]

Display projects involve a creative assembly of a [[display board]] and construction of a model to show a visual representation of a larger fact. Making a model of the [[solar system]], a house, or of a simple [[Electrical network|electric circuit]] are considered display projects. Display boards are used to enhance the presentation. A [[tablet computer]] can be attached to the display board to make interactive display boards.

==Theoretical projects==

Theoretical projects may involve the same format as experimental or engineering projects. However, for
several possible reasons, such as lack of feasibility due to costs, the actual experiment is not performed.

The '''Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism''' is a research institute at [[Tel Aviv University]] in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Anti-Semitism and Racism|url=http://www.shoahlegacy.org/org/stephen-roth-institute-study-contemporary-anti-semitism-and-racism|publisher=[[European Shoah Legacy Institute]]|accessdate=25 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203061955/http://www.shoahlegacy.org/org/stephen-roth-institute-study-contemporary-anti-semitism-and-racism|archivedate=3 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is a resource for information, provides a forum for academic discussion, and fosters research on issues concerning [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[Racism|racist]] theories and manifestations. The Institute's principal focus is the social and political exploitation of these phenomena in the period since the end of [[World War II]], and the influence of their historical background.

==Details==
The Institute was founded as the Project for the Study of Anti-Semitism in the fall of 1991, and was headed by Prof. Dina Porat of Tel Aviv University until 2010. Since then, Dr. Scott Ury of Tel Aviv University's Department of Jewish History has been Director of the Roth Institute. The Institute is situated within Tel Aviv University's Faculty of the Humanities and is associated with the [[Wiener Library for the Study of the Nazi Era and the Holocaust]] in Tel Aviv, home of one of the world's richest collections of documents related to [[Fascism|fascist]] regimes and movements, and antisemitism. The Institute welcomes visitors and fosters cooperation with universities and research institutes outside Israel.

==Activities==
The institute's activities are:&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Roth Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

'''T-vertices''' is a term used in [[computer graphics]] to describe a problem that can occur during [[Subdivision surface|mesh refinement]] or [[mesh simplification]].  The most common case occurs in naive implementations of continuous [[level of detail]], where a finer-level mesh is "sewn" together with a coarser-level mesh by simply aligning the finer vertices on the edges of the course [[polygons]].  The result is a continuous mesh, however due to the nature of the [[z-buffer]] and certain lighting [[algorithms]] such as [[Gouraud shading]], visual [[Digital artifact|artifacts]] can often be detected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr98/cs598d/lectures/alejo/ Frequent Mesh Problems, www.cs.princeton.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Example of T-vertices in Blender after applying a subdivision modifier.png|thumb|T-vertices after applying a subdivision modifier. The T-vertices result in cracks in the model because subdivision surfaces only work for meshes with correct topology.]]
Some modeling algorithms such as [[subdivision surface]]s will fail when a model contains T-vertices.

'''''The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended''''' is an approximately 87,000-word composition written by Sir [[Isaac Newton]], first published posthumously in 1728 in limited supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Isaac |last= Newton |title=The chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended : To Which is Prefix'd, A Short Chronicle From the First Memory of Things in Europe, to the Conquest of Persia by Alexander the Great  |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3931/e-rara-37430|year=1728|publisher= Printed for J. Tonson ; J. Osborn ; T. Longman |place=London |edition=1 |volume=|access-date= June 17, 2016| via=e-rara.ch (ETH-Bibliothek Zürich)|doi= 10.3931/e-rara-37430 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it had been republished in mass paperback format.  The work represents one of Newton's forays into the topic of [[chronology]], detailing the rise and history of various ancient kingdoms throughout antiquity.

The treatise is composed of eight primary sections.  First is an introductory letter to [[Caroline of Ansbach]], the [[List of English consorts|Queen of England]] by Newton's estate manager [[John Conduitt]], followed by a short advertisement.  After this is found a section entitled "''A Short Chronicle''" which serves as a brief historical list of events listed in chronological order, beginning with the earliest listed date of 1125 BC and the most recent listed at 331 BC.  The majority of the treatise, however, is in the form of six chapters that explore the history of specific civilizations.  These chapters are titled:

*Chap. I. Of the Chronology of the First Ages of the Greeks.
*Chap. II. Of the Empire of Egypt.
*Chap. III. Of the Assyrian Empire.
*Chap. IV. Of the two Contemporary Empires of the Babylonians and Medes.
*Chap. V. A Description of the Temple of Solomon.
*Chap. VI. Of the Empire of the Persians.

According to John Conduitt's introductory letter, ''The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended'' was Isaac Newton's last personally revised work before his death but had actually been written much earlier.  Some of its subject material and contents have led many people to categorize this work as one of [[Isaac Newton's occult studies]].

==Summary==

The book attempts to revise the accepted ancient chronology of Newton's day, in order to prove that [[Solomon]] was the earliest king in the world, and that his Temple the first ever built, with all others being copies, beginning with [[Sesostris]], King of Egypt, followed by others. Newton's results, therefore, diverge widely from presently accepted dates, often more widely than the system that he attempted to displace.

Newton attempted to [[Euhemerism|identify various mythological figures as historical]] or Biblical individuals, such as arguing that the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] was [[Noah]], the [[Sky deity|god]] [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] was [[Shem]], and [[Osiris]] and [[Dionysus]] were [[Sesostris]].&lt;ref name="Ernest"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cs.nyu.edu/davise/papers/Newton.pdf |title=Review of Newton and the Origin of Civilization, by Jed Z.

[[File:The Concept of Law.jpg|thumb|First edition]]
'''''The Concept of Law''''' ({{ISBN|0-19-876122-8}}) is the most famous work of the [[legal philosophy|legal philosopher]] [[H. L. A. Hart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.angelfire.com/md2/timewarp/hart.html|title = H.L.A. Hart’s The Concept of Law|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was first published in 1961 and develops Hart's theory of [[legal positivism]] (the view that laws are rules made by human beings and that there is no inherent or necessary connection between law and [[morality]]) within the framework of [[analytic philosophy]].  In this work, Hart sets out to write an essay of descriptive [[sociology]] and [[analytical jurisprudence]].  ''The Concept of Law'' provides an explanation to a number of traditional jurisprudential questions such as "what is law?", "must laws be rules?", and "what is the relation between law and morality?".  Hart answers these by placing law into a social context while at the same time leaving the capability for rigorous analysis of legal terms, which in effect "awakened English jurisprudence from its comfortable slumbers".&lt;ref name="Postema"&gt;{{cite book|last=Postema|first=Gerald|title=Legal Philosophy in the Twentieth Century: The Common Law World|editor=Enrico Pattaro|publisher=Springer|date=2011|series=A Treatise of Legal Philosophy and General Jurisprudence|volume=11|pages=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result Hart's book has remained "one of the most influential text of analytical legal philosophy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/the-endless-search-for-truth/|title=The Endless Search For Truth: Richard Marshall interviews Andrei Marmor|last=Marshall|first=Richard|date=2012-07-06|publisher=[[3:AM Magazine]]|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "the most successful work of analytical jurisprudence ever to appear in the common law world"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=A. W. Brian|title=Reflections on 'The Concept of Law'|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2011|pages=1|isbn=0199693323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
''The Concept of Law'' emerged from a set of lectures Hart delivered in 1952. The lectures were preceded by Hart's Holmes lecture, ''Positivism and the Separation of Law and Morals'' at [[Harvard Law School]]. The book developed a sophisticated view of legal positivism.

Among the ideas developed in the book are:
*A critique of [[John Austin (legal philosophy)|John Austin's]] theory that law is the command of the sovereign backed by sanction.
*A distinction between primary and secondary legal rules, where a primary rule governs conduct and a secondary rule allows the creation, alteration, or extinction of primary rules.
*A distinction between the internal and external points of view of law and rules, close to (and influenced by) [[Max Weber]]'s distinction between the sociological and the legal perspectives of law.
*The idea of the [[rule of recognition]], a social rule that differentiated between those norms that have the authority of law and those that do not. Hart viewed the rule of recognition as an evolution from [[Hans Kelsen]]'s "''[[Grundnorm]]''", or "basic norm".
*A reply to [[Ronald Dworkin]], who criticized legal positivism in general and especially Hart's account of law in ''Taking Rights Seriously'' (1977), ''A Matter of Principle'' (1985) and ''Law's Empire'' (1986).

==Austin's "command theory"==
The starting point for the discussion is Hart's dissatisfaction with [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]]'s "command theory": a jurisprudential concept that holds that law is command backed by threat and is meant to be ubiquitous in its application.  Hart likens Austin's theory to the role of a [[gun|gunman]] in a [[bank]] and tries to establish the differences between the gunman's orders and those made by law. (For instance, the gunman forces us to obey but we may not feel inclined to obey him. Presumably, obedience to the law comes with a different feeling.) 

Hart identifies three such important differences: content, origin, and range. In terms of content, not all laws are imperative or [[coercive]]. Some are facilitative, allowing us to create [[contracts]] and other legal relations.

Austin believed that every legal system had to have a [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] who creates the law (origin) while remaining unaffected by it (range), such as the bank scene's gunman, who is the only source of commands and who is not subject to other's commands.  Hart argues that this is an inaccurate description of law, noting that laws may have several sources and legislators are very often subject to the laws they create. Hart lets us know that laws are much broader in scope than coercive orders, contrary to the "command theory" of Austin. Frequently laws are enabling and so allow citizens to carry out authoritative acts such as the making of wills or contracts which have legal effect.

==Social habits and rules==
Hart draws a distinction between a social [[Habit (psychology)|habit]] (which people follow habitually but where breaking the habit does not bring about opprobrium - going to the cinema on Thursday for example) and a social rule (where breaking the rule is seen as wrong - neglecting to take off one's hat upon entering a church, for example).  We feel in some sense bound by social rules and laws frequently appear to be types of social rule. 

There are two perspectives to this: the external aspect, which is the independently observable fact that people do tend to obey the rule with regularity, and the internal aspect which is the feeling by an individual of being in some sense obligated to follow the rule, otherwise known as the critical reflective attitude. It is from this internal sense that the law acquires its normative quality. The obedience by the populace of a rule is called efficacy. No law can be said to be efficacious unless followed by the majority of the populace. Though an average citizen in a modern state with a developed legal system may feel the internal aspect and be compelled to follow the laws, it is more important for the officials of the society/peoples to have  the internal aspect since it is up to them to follow the constitutional provisions which, if they wish, could ignore without accountability. Yet, the officials must use the internal aspect and accept the standards as guiding their behaviour in addition to also guiding the behaviour of other officials.

==Hart's Empirical Legal System in "The Concept of Law"==
Hart believed law is the union of '''primary rules''' (rules of conduct) and '''secondary rules''' (empowering rules). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hart|first1=H.L.A.|title=The Concept of Law|date=1994|page=94|edition=2d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary Rules===
''Primary rules'' are rules, or laws, that govern general societal conduct. Thus, ''primary rules'' construct legal obligations and consequences when they are disobeyed. A good example of a ''primary rule'' is the law against murder; it prohibits a person from killing and attaches consequences for committing, attempting to commit, and conspiring to commit the crime.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.93&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary Rules===
''Secondary rules'' confer power to create sovereignty; they also confer the power to change, modify, or enforce primary (and secondary) rules.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.93-120&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary rules combat the three major issues of legal systems that ''primary rules'' can't–(1) &lt;u&gt;uncertainty&lt;/u&gt; of the law, (2) &lt;u&gt;efficiency&lt;/u&gt; of the law, and (3) &lt;u&gt;static&lt;/u&gt; ''quality'' of the law. Each kind of ''secondary rule'' addresses a separate one of those three issues, yet all are interdependent.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.93-97&lt;/ref&gt; Hart separates secondary rules into three types–the '''rules of recognition''', the '''rules of change''', and the '''rules of adjudication'''.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.93-120&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rules of Recognition====
Hart states that the remedy for the &lt;u&gt;uncertainty&lt;/u&gt; of the regime of primary rules is a ''rule of recognition''. &lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.94&lt;/ref&gt; The rule of recognition is a collection of standards and requisites that govern the validity of all rules; thus, the rule of recognition confers power to new rules by validating them. For a rule to be valid is to recognize it as passing all the tests provided by the rule of recognition. &lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.103&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Rules of Change====
There are no legal systems that can be classified as [[pareto optimal]]. The next best thing is to make sure that the system does not remain at a static quality but instead is dynamic and progressive. The remedy for the &lt;u&gt;static&lt;/u&gt; quality of the regime of ''primary rules'' are ''rules of change''.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.95&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, rules of change confer and prohibit power of the creation, extinction and alteration of primary and secondary rules. Rules of change range in complexity: “the powers conferred may be unrestricted or limited in various ways: and the rules may, besides specifying the persons who are to legislate, define in more or less rigid terms the procedure to be followed in legislation.” As mentioned earlier, rules of change are interdependent with the other rules. Hart emphasizes the “close connection between the rules of change and the rules of recognition.” Where rules of change exist, rules of recognition "ʺwill necessarily incorporate a reference to legislation as an identifying feature of the rules, though it need not refer to all the details of procedure involved in legislation.” &lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.96&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Rules of Adjudication====
''Rules of adjudication'' were intended to remedy the &lt;u&gt;inefficiency&lt;/u&gt; of its diffused social pressure. Rules of adjudication empower individuals to make authoritative determinations of the question whether, on a particular occasion, a primary rule has been broken.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.96-97 (“Besides identifying the individuals who are to adjudicate, such rules will also define the procedure to be followed”)&lt;/ref&gt; Rules of adjudication govern the election and procedure of the judiciary. However, intermingled with who adjudicates is what laws they adjudicate. &lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.96-97 (Hart emphasizes that “if courts are empowered to make authoritative determinations of the fact that a rule has been broken, these cannot avoid being taken as authoritative determinations of what the rules are.”)&lt;/ref&gt; Under that logic, rules of adjudication, like rules of change, must also be supplemented by rules of recognition of some sort. Thus, “the rule which confers jurisdiction will also be a rule of recognition, identifying the primary rules through the judgments of the courts and these judgments will become a 'source' of law.”&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.96-97 (Hart emphasizes that a “system which has rules of adjudication is necessarily also committed to a rule of recognition of an elementary and imperfect sort.”)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1391">In [[mycology]], '''trama''' is the inner, fleshy  portion  of a [[mushroom]]'s [[basidiocarp]], or fruit body. It is distinct from the outer layer of tissue, known as the [[pileipellis]] or [[cuticle]], and from the [[spore]]-bearing tissue layer known as the [[hymenium]]. 

In essence, the trama is the tissue we call the "flesh" of mushrooms and similar fungi.&lt;ref name=largent&gt;Largent D, Johnson D, Watling R. 1977. ''How to Identify Mushrooms to Genus III: Microscopic Features''. Arcata, CA: Mad River Press. {{ISBN|0-916422-09-7}}. pp. 60–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Literally, "trama" is the [[Latin]] word for the "[[weft]]" or "[[Weft|woof]]" yarns in the weaving of cloth.&lt;ref name="isbn0-398-06179-3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jaeger, Edmund C. | authorlink=Edmund Jaeger |title=A Source-Book of Biological Names and Terms |publisher=Thomas |location=Springfield, Ill |year=1959 |pages= |isbn=0-398-06179-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This probably is related to the basidiocarp trama being "filler" tissue and that analogously the woof yarn in weaving is sometimes called "[[weft|fill]]". Furthermore, the trama tends to be soft tissue, and in weaving, the woof yarn is not tightly stretched; it therefore need not as a rule be as strong as the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] yarn.

The '''Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute''' ({{lang-ru|Центра́льный аэрогидродинами́ческий институ́т, ЦАГИ|Tsentralniy Aerogidrodinamicheskiy Institut}}, '''TsAGI''') was founded in [[Moscow]] by Russian [[aviation]] pioneer [[Nikolai Yegorovich Zhukovsky]] on December 1, 1918.

==History==
Since 1925 and into the 1930s, TsAGI developed and hosted [[Andrei Tupolev|Tupolev]]'s AGOS (''Aviatziya, Gidroaviatziya i Opytnoye Stroitelstvo'', the "Aviation, Hydroaviation, and Experimental Construction"), the first aircraft design bureau in Soviet Union, and at the time the main one.&lt;ref name=arm&gt;{{cite book|pages=15–16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ygg66pf52OsC&amp;pg=PA16|title=The Soviet armaments industry|isbn=978-3-7186-5313-3|author1=Albrecht|first1=Ulrich|last2=Nikutta|first2=Randolph|date=October 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, two other major aircraft design bureaus in the country were the [[Sergei Ilyushin|Ilyushin]]'s "unsystematic" [[TsKB]] (''Tsentralnoye Konstruksionnoye Byuro'', the "Central Design Bureau") and an independent, short-lived [[Konstantin Kalinin|Kalinin]]'s team in [[Kharkiv]].&lt;ref name=arm/&gt;

In 1935 TsAGI was partly relocated to the former [[dacha]] settlement ''Otdykh'' (literally, "Relaxation") converted to the new [[urban-type settlement]] ''Stakhanovo''. It was named after [[Alexey Stakhanov]], a famous Soviet miner. On April&amp;nbsp;23, 1947, the settlement was granted town status and renamed to [[Zhukovsky (city, Moscow Oblast)|Zhukovsky]]. The Moscow branch of the institute is currently known as '''MAGI''', or '''Moscow complex of TsAGI'''.

In 1965 in Zhukovsky an [[Department of Aeromechanics and Flight Engineering of MIPT]] was established under TsAGI; it has been preparing young specialists able to solve complex problems of the aircraft industry.

Among latest TsAGI developments are the rocket [[Energia]] and the [[Buran program|Space Shuttle Buran]].

In 2013 TsAGI developed a testbench for high-speed [[compound helicopter]]s with propellers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tsagi.com/pressroom/news/994/ TsAGI has created a unique test bench for testing high-speed helicopters] TsAGI, 13 december 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1779">A '''valence issue''' is a [[political issue]] about which voters will usually share a common preference.

[[Prosperity]] is a common valence issue.  All voters will want their community to prosper and so the consideration is not whether to seek prosperity or not but instead the issue is which party is most likely to deliver it. Further examples include the desire for high economic growth, low inflation, low unemployment, a strong national defense, high quality education and healthcare, sufficient housing and adequate transport infrastructure.

Valence issues may be contrasted with '''position issues''' — divisive issues for which there are different preferences.  In a study of campaigns for the [[US Senate]], candidates focused upon valence issues in 77% of their advertising.  The issues identified as positional or valence were:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |pages=67–70 |title=Spectacle of United States Senate Campaigns |author1=Kim Fridkin |author2=Kim Fridkin Kahn |author3=Patrick J. Kenney |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=1999 |isbn=9780691005058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], valence issues may include [[campaign finance reform]], [[care of the elderly]], [[crime]], [[daycare]], [[economy]], [[education]], [[inflation]], and [[job (role)|jobs]]. To contrast, position issues in the United States include [[abortion]], [[civil rights]], [[Salaries of members of the United States Congress|congressional pay]], [[death penalty]], [[drugs]], [[foreign aid]], the [[Natural environment|environment]], [[gun control]], [[healthcare]], [[nuclear proliferation]], [[school prayer]], [[taxes]], and [[term limits]]. Some of these may be seen differently in other countries.

A '''winged altarpiece''' (also ''folding altar'') or '''winged retable''' is a special form of [[altarpiece]] ([[reredos]], occasionally [[retable]]), common in Central Europe, in which the fixed [[shrine]] or ''corpus'' can be enclosed by two ([[triptych]]), four ([[pentaptych]]) or more ([[polyptych]]) movable wings. The technical terms are derived from {{lang-grc|τρίς}}: ''trís'' or "triple"; πέντε: ''pénte'' or "five"; πολύς: ''polýs'' or "many"; and πτυχή: ''ptychē'' or "fold, layer".&lt;ref name="GEMOLL"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Wilhelm Gemoll|Title=Griechisch-Deutsches Schul- und Handwörterbuch |Publisher=G. Freytag Verlag/Hölder-Pichler-Tempsky|PublicationPlace=München/Wien|Year=1965|Date=  1965|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the winged altar can display different scenes on weekdays, Sundays or holidays, based on the motifs and type of decoration (painted panels or [[relief]]s), it is also called a liturgical altar. An [[altarpiece]] is often mounted on the altar shrine, but more usually it has a carving (carved altar). Above the retable may be found the crowning or superstructure,  [[pinnacle]]s and flowers of the cross. [[Relic]]s can be housed below it, in a [[reliquary]] in the [[predella]] lying on the [[altar stone]].
