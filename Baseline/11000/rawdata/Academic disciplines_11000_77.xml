      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26726">'''Academic studies of the political groups of the European Parliament''' refers to the studies of [[Political groups of the European Parliament|those groups]] by academics, the methods that they use and the conclusions that they reach.

==Background==
{{main|Political groups of the European Parliament}}
The [[Political groups of the European Parliament|political groups]] of the [[European Parliament]] have been around in one form or another since September 1952 and the first meeting of the Parliament's predecessor, the Common Assembly. The groups are coalitions of [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] and the [[European political party|Europarties]] and [[political party|national parties]] that those MEPs belong to. The groups have coalesced into representations of the dominant schools of European political thought and are the primary actors in the Parliament.

Some of the groups (such as PES) have become homogeneous units coterminous with their Europarty, some (such as IND/DEM) have not. But they are still coalitions, not parties in their own right, and do not issue [[manifesto]]s of their own. It may therefore be difficult to discern how the groups intend to vote without first inspecting the [[party platform]]s of their constituent parties, and then with limited certainty.

Additionally, national media focus on the MEPs/national parties of their own member state, neglecting the group's activities and poorly understanding their structure or even existence. Transnational media coverage of the groups ''per se'' is limited to those organs such as the Parliament itself, or those news media (e.g. EUObserver&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/ |title=EUobserver |publisher=EUobserver |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100618101546/http://euobserver.com/| archivedate= 18 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; or theParliament.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theparliament.com/ |title=EU Politics News and Policy |publisher=TheParliament.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100628095128/http://www.theparliament.com/| archivedate= 28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that specialise in the Parliament. These organs cover the groups in detail but with little overarching analysis. So although such organs make it easy to find out how a group acted on a specific vote, they provide little information on the voting patterns of a specific group.

As a result, the only bodies providing analysis of the voting patterns and [[Weltanschauung]] of the groups are academics.

==Academics==
Academics analysing the groups include [[Simon Hix]] ([[London School of Economics and Political Science]]), [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/kreppel/ Amie Kreppel] [[University of Florida]], [[Abdul Noury]] ([[Free University of Brussels]]), [[Gérard Roland (economist)|Gérard Roland]], ([[University of California, Berkeley]]), [[Gail McElroy]] ([[Trinity College, Dublin]], Department of Political Science), [[Kenneth Benoit]] ([[Trinity College, Dublin]] - Institute for International Integration Studies (IIIS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=IIIS (Email) |url=http://www.tcd.ie/iiis/ |title=Institute for International Integration Studies (IIIS) : Trinity College Dublin, The University of Dublin, Ireland |publisher=Tcd.ie |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Friedrich Heinemann]], [[Philipp Mohl]], and [[Steffen Osterloh]] ([[University of Mannheim]] - Centre for European Economic Research&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zew.de/en/&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Results==

===Positions on economy and euroscepticism===

The results for each group are shown in the adjacent diagram. The vertical scale is anti-pro Europe spectrum, (0% = extremely anti-Europe, 100% = extremely pro), and the horizontal scale is economic left-right spectrum, (0% = extremely economically left-wing, 100% = extremely economically right-wing). The results are also shown in the table below.

Two of the groups (EPP-ED and IND/DEM) were split. EPP-ED are split on Euroscepticism: the EPP subgroup ( {{legend2|#3399FF|}}) were centre-right Europhiles, whereas the ED subgroup ( {{legend2|#0000FF|}}) were right-wing Eurosceptics.

IND/DEM was also split along its subgroups: the reformist subgroup ( {{legend2|#FF9900|}}, bottom-center) voted as centrist Eurosceptics, and the secessionist subgroup ( {{legend2|#FF9900|}}, middle-right) voted as right-wing Euroneutrals. The reformist subgroup was able to pursue a reformist agenda via the Parliament. The secessionist subgroup was unable to pursue a secessionist agenda there (it's out of the Parliament's purview) and pursued a right-wing agenda instead. This resulted in the secessionist subgroup being ''less'' eurosceptic in terms of roll-call votes than other, non-eurosceptic parties. UKIP (the major component of the secessionist subgroup) was criticised for this seeming abandonment of its Eurosceptic core principles.&lt;ref name="Times1845227"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article1845227.ece Leader of the UKIP accused of selling out, The Sunday Times, May 27, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517032543/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article1845227.ece |date=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EUL/NGL and G/EFA voted closely together, as did PES and ALDE, and EPP-ED and UEN. Surprisingly, given that PES and EPP-ED are partners in the Grand Coalition, they were not each other's closest allies, although they did vote with each other about two-thirds of the time. IND/DEM did not have close allies within the political groups, preferring instead to cooperate most closely with the [[Non-Inscrits]].

EUL/NGL and G/EFA were the most left-wing groups, UEN and EDD the most right-wing, and that was mirrored in their attitudes towards taxation, homosexual equality, abortion, euthanasia and controlling migration into the EU. The groups fell into two distinct camps regarding further development of EU authority, with UEN and EDD definitely against and the rest broadly in favor. Opinion was wider on the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|CFSP]], with only PES, ELDR and EPP-ED in favor and the others against. Unsurprisingly, G/EFA was far more in favor of Green issues compared to the other groups.

''Cohesion'' is the term used to define whether a Group is united or divided amongst itself. Figure 1&lt;ref name="EIOP200200201"&gt;[http://eiop.or.at/eiop/texte/2002-002.htm "Why Do MEPs Defect? An Analysis of Party Group Cohesion in the 5th European Parliament" by Thorsten Faas, 12 March 2002] original figure estimated from "[http://eiop.or.at/eiop/texte/2002-002t.htm#Figure1 Figure 1: Cohesion in the EP by Party Groups]"&lt;/ref&gt; of a [http://eiop.or.at/eiop/texte/2002-002.htm 2002 paper] from European Integration online Papers (EIoP) by Thorsten Faas analysed the Groups as they stood in 2002. 
The results for each Group are given in the adjacent diagram with the horizontal scale scaled so that 0% = totally split, 100% = totally united. The results are also given in the table below.

===Group switching===
Party group switching in the European Parliament is the phenomenon where parliamentarians individually or collectively switch from one party group to the other. The phenomenon of EP party group switching is a well-known contributor to the volatility of the EP party system and highlights the fluidity that characterizes the composition of European parliamentary groups. On average 9% of all MEPs switch during legislative terms. Party group switching is a phenomenon that gained force especially in the legislatures during the 1990s, up to a maximum of 18% for the 1989-1994 term, with strong prevalence among representatives from France and Italy, though by no means limited to those two countries. There is a clear tendency of party group switches from the ideological extremes, both left and right, toward the center. Most switching takes place at the outset of legislative terms, with another peak around the half-term moment, when responsibilities rotate within the EP hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, A.M. and M. Vink (2012). Measuring Group Switching in the European Parliament: Methodology, Data and Trends (1979-2009).

An '''Armenian cross''' is a symbol that combines a [[cross]] with a floral postament or elements. In the [[Armenian Christianity]] it was combined with the [[Christian cross]] and this design was often used for [[high cross]]es ([[khachkar]]) – a free-standing cross made of stone and often richly decorated.

'''Atomic, molecular, and optical physics (AMO)''' is the study of [[matter]]-matter and [[light]]-matter interactions; at the scale of one or a few [[atom]]s&lt;ref name=nap&gt;{{cite book|title=Atomic, molecular, and optical physics|year=1986|publisher=National Academy Press|isbn=978-0-309-03575-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and energy scales around several [[electron volt]]s.&lt;ref name=Drake&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of atomic, molecular, and optical physics|author=Editor: Gordon Drake (Various authors)|year=1996|edition=|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|isbn=978-0-387-20802-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1356}}&lt;ref name=chen&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=L. T. (ed.)|title=Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics: New Research|year=2009|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|isbn=978-1-60456-907-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The three areas are closely interrelated.  AMO theory includes [[classical physics|classical]], [[Semiclassical physics|semi-classical]] and [[quantum physics|quantum]] treatments.  Typically, the theory and applications of [[Emission spectrum|emission]], [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], [[scattering]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (light) from [[Excited state|excited]] [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s, analysis of spectroscopy, generation of [[laser]]s and [[maser]]s, and the optical properties of matter in general, fall into these categories.

== Atomic and molecular physics ==
{{main article|Atomic physics|Molecular physics}}
'''Atomic physics''' is the subfield of AMO that studies atoms as an isolated system of [[electron]]s and an [[atomic nuclei|atomic nucleus]], while '''molecular physics''' is the study of the physical properties of [[molecule]]s. The term ''atomic physics'' is often associated with [[nuclear power]] and [[nuclear bomb]]s, due to the [[synonym]]ous use of ''atomic'' and ''nuclear'' in [[standard English]]. However, physicists distinguish between atomic physics — which deals with the atom as a system consisting of a nucleus and electrons — and [[nuclear physics]], which considers [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] alone. The important experimental techniques are the various types of [[spectroscopy]]. Molecular physics, while closely related to [[atomic physics]], also overlaps greatly with [[theoretical chemistry]], [[physical chemistry]] and [[chemical physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=|page=803|title=McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics|author=C.B. Parker|year=1994|edition=2nd|publisher=McGraw Hill |isbn=978-0-07-051400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both subfields are primarily concerned with [[electronic structure]] and the dynamical processes by which these arrangements change. Generally this work involves using quantum mechanics. For molecular physics, this approach is known as [[quantum chemistry]]. One important aspect of molecular physics is that the essential [[atomic orbital]] theory in the field of atomic physics expands to the [[molecular orbital]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=chapter 9|page=|title=Chemistry, Matter, and the Universe|author1=R. E. Dickerson |author2=I. Geis |year=1976|edition=|publisher=W.A. Benjamin Inc. (USA)|isbn=978-0-19-855148-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular physics is concerned with atomic processes in molecules, but it is additionally concerned with effects due to the [[molecular structure]]. Additionally to the electronic excitation states which are known from atoms, molecules are able to rotate and to vibrate. These rotations and vibrations are quantized; there are discrete [[energy level]]s. The smallest energy differences exist between different rotational states, therefore pure rotational [[Spectrum|spectra]] are in the far [[infrared]] region (about 30 - 150 [[µm]] [[wavelength]]) of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. [[Vibrational spectroscopy of linear molecules|Vibrational spectra]] are in the near infrared (about 1 - 5&amp;nbsp;µm) and spectra resulting from electronic transitions are mostly in the visible and [[ultraviolet]] regions. From measuring rotational and vibrational spectra properties of molecules like the distance between the nuclei can be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=chapters 12, 13, 17|page=|title=The Light Fantastic – Introduction to Classic and Quantum Optics|author=I.R. Kenyon|year=2008|edition=|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-856646-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many scientific fields, strict delineation can be highly contrived and atomic physics is often considered in the wider context of ''atomic, molecular, and optical physics''. Physics research groups are usually so classified.

There is no strong distinction, however, between optical physics, applied optics, and optical engineering, since the devices of optical engineering and the applications of applied optics are necessary for basic research in optical physics, and that research leads to the development of new devices and applications. Often the same people are involved in both the basic research and the applied technology development, for example the experimental demonstration of [[electromagnetically induced transparency]] by [[S. E. Harris]] and of [[slow light]] by Harris and [[Lene Vestergaard Hau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sciencewatch.com/nobel/predictions/slow-light |title=Slow Light |website=Science Watch |accessdate=Jan 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=chapters 9,10|page=|title=Light and Matter: Electromagnetism, Optics, Spectroscopy and Lasers|author=Y.B.

Researchers in optical physics use and develop light sources that span the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] from [[microwave]]s to [[X-ray]]s.

==History==
{{Main article|Atomic theory|Basics of quantum mechanics}}
[[File:Bohr-atom-PAR.svg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Bohr model]] of the [[Hydrogen atom]]]]
One of the earliest steps towards ''atomic physics'' was the recognition that matter was composed of ''atoms'', in modern terms the basic unit of a [[chemical element]]. This theory was developed by [[John Dalton]] in the 18th century. At this stage, it wasn't clear what atoms were - although they could be described and classified by their observable properties in bulk; summarized by the developing [[periodic table]], by [[John Alexander Reina Newlands|John Newlands]] and [[Dmitri Mendeleyev]] around the mid to late 19th century.&lt;ref name="R.E. Dickerson, I. Geis 1976"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=chapters 7, 8|page=|title=Chemistry, Matter, and the Universe|author1=R. E. Dickerson |author2=I. Geis |year=1976|edition=|publisher=W.A. Benjamin Inc. (USA)|isbn=978-0-19-855148-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the connection between atomic physics ''and'' optical physics became apparent, by the discovery of [[spectral line]]s and attempts to describe the phenomenon - notably by [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]], [[Fresnel]], and others in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=|pages=4–11|title=Light and Matter: Electromagnetism, Optics, Spectroscopy and Lasers|author=Y.B. Band|year=2010|edition=|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-89931-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From that time to the 1920s, physicists were seeking to explain [[atomic spectra]] and [[blackbody radiation]]. One attempt to explain hydrogen spectral lines was the [[Bohr atom model]].&lt;ref name="R.E. Dickerson, I. Geis 1976"/&gt;

Experiments including [[electromagnetic radiation]] and matter - such as the [[photoelectric effect]], [[Compton effect]], and spectra of sunlight the due to the unknown element of [[Helium]], the limitation of the Bohr model to Hydrogen, and numerous other reasons, lead to an entirely new mathematical model of matter and light: [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=chapter 34|page=|title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers - with Modern Physics|author1=P. A. Tipler |author2=G. Mosca |year=2008|edition=|publisher=Freeman|isbn=978-0-7167-8964-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical oscillator model of matter===
Early models to explain the origin of the [[refractive index|index of refraction]] treated an [[electron]] in an atomic system classically according to the model of [[Paul Drude]] and [[Hendrik Lorentz]]. The theory was developed to attempt to provide an origin for the wavelength-dependent refractive index ''n'' of a material. In this model, incident [[electromagnetic waves]] forced an electron bound to an atom to [[Oscillation|oscillate]]. The [[amplitude]] of the oscillation would then have a relationship to the [[frequency]] of the incident electromagnetic wave and the [[Resonance|resonant]] frequencies of the oscillator. The [[Superposition principle|superposition]] of these emitted waves from many oscillators would then lead to a wave which moved more slowly.

===Early quantum model of matter and light===
[[Max Planck]] derived a formula to describe the [[electromagnetic field]] inside a box when in [[thermal equilibrium]] in 1900.&lt;ref name=Haken /&gt;{{rp|8–9}}
His model consisted of a superposition of [[standing waves]]. In one dimension, the box has length ''L'', and only sinusoidal waves of [[wavenumber]]
:&lt;math&gt; k = \frac{n\pi}{L} &lt;/math&gt;
can occur in the box, where ''n'' is a positive [[integer]] (mathematically denoted by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle n \in \mathbb{N}_1&lt;/math&gt;). The equation describing these standing waves is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;E=E_0 \sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{L}x\right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

where ''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the magnitude of the [[electric field]] amplitude, and ''E'' is the magnitude of the electric field at position ''x''. From this basic, [[Planck's law]] was derived.&lt;ref name=Haken /&gt;{{rp|4–8,51–52}}
&lt;!-- It's in the energy density form in the book --&gt;

In 1911, [[Ernest Rutherford]] concluded, based on alpha particle scattering, that an atom has a central pointlike proton. He also thought that an electron would be still attracted to the proton by Coulomb's law, which he had verified still held at small scales. As a result, he believed that electrons revolved around the proton. [[Niels Bohr]], in 1913, combined the Rutherford model of the atom with the quantisation ideas of Planck. Only specific and well-defined orbits of the electron could exist, which also do not radiate light. In jumping orbit the electron would emit or absorb light corresponding to the difference in energy of the orbits. His prediction of the energy levels was then consistent with observation.&lt;ref name=Haken /&gt;{{rp|9–10}}

These results, based on a ''discrete'' set of specific standing waves, were inconsistent with the ''continuous'' classical oscillator model.&lt;ref name=Haken /&gt;{{rp|8}}

Work by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1905 on the [[photoelectric effect]] led to the association of a light wave of frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; with a photon of energy &lt;math&gt;h\nu&lt;/math&gt;. In 1917 Einstein created an extension to Bohrs model by the introduction of the three processes of [[stimulated emission]], [[spontaneous emission]] and [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)]].&lt;ref name=Haken /&gt;{{rp|11}}

==Modern treatments==
The largest steps towards the modern treatment was the formulation of quantum mechanics with the [[matrix mechanics]] approach by [[Werner Heisenberg]] and the discovery of the [[Schrödinger equation]] by [[Erwin Schrödinger]].&lt;ref name=Haken /&gt;{{rp|12}}

There are a variety of semi-classical treatments within AMO. Which aspects of the problem are treated quantum mechanically and which are treated classically is dependent on the specific problem at hand. The semi-classical approach is ubiquitous in computational work within AMO, largely due to the large decrease in computational cost and complexity associated with it.

For matter under the action of a laser, a fully quantum mechanical treatment of the atomic or molecular system is combined with the system being under the action of a classical electromagnetic field.&lt;ref name=Haken /&gt;{{rp|14}} Since the field is treated classically it can not deal with [[spontaneous emission]].&lt;ref name=Haken /&gt;{{rp|16}} This semi-classical treatment is valid for most systems,&lt;ref name=Drake /&gt;{{rp|997}} particular those under the action of high intensity laser fields.&lt;ref name=Drake /&gt;{{rp|724}} The distinction between optical physics and quantum optics is the use of semi-classical and fully quantum treatments respectively.&lt;ref name=Drake /&gt;{{rp|997}}

Within collision dynamics and using the semi-classical treatment, the internal degrees of freedom may be treated quantum mechanically, whilst the relative motion of the quantum systems under consideration are treated classically.&lt;ref name=Drake /&gt;{{rp|556}} When considering medium to high speed collisions, the nuclei can be treated classically while the electron is treated quantum mechanically. In low speed collisions the approximation fails.&lt;ref name=Drake /&gt;{{rp|754}}&lt;!-- Expand from here, weaknesses of the particular approximation are also described --&gt;

Classical Monte-Carlo methods for the dynamics of electrons can be described as semi-classical in that the initial conditions are calculated using a fully quantum treatment, but all further treatment is classical.&lt;ref name=Drake /&gt;{{rp|871}}

==Isolated atoms and molecules==
Atomic, Molecular and Optical physics frequently considers atoms and molecules in isolation&lt;!-- not always, there are some multi-particle groups --&gt;. Atomic models will consist of a single nucleus that may be surrounded by one or more bound electrons, whilst molecular models are typically concerned with molecular hydrogen and its [[molecular hydrogen ion]]. It is concerned with processes such as [[ionization]], [[above threshold ionization]] and [[excited state|excitation]] by photons or collisions with atomic particles.

While modelling atoms in isolation may not seem realistic, if one considers molecules in a [[gas]] or [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] then the time-scales for molecule-molecule interactions are huge in comparison to the atomic and molecular processes that we are concerned with. This means that the individual molecules can be treated as if each were in isolation for the vast majority of the time.  By this consideration atomic and molecular physics provides the underlying theory in [[plasma (physics)|plasma physics]] and [[atmospheric physics]] even though both deal with huge numbers of molecules.

==Electronic configuration==
Electrons form notional [[Electron shell|shells]] around the nucleus. These are naturally in a [[ground state]] but can be excited by the absorption of energy from light ([[photon]]s), magnetic fields, or interaction with a colliding particle (typically other electrons).

Electrons that populate a shell are said to be in a [[bound state]].  The energy necessary to remove an electron from its shell (taking it to infinity) is called the [[binding energy]].  Any quantity of energy absorbed by the electron in excess of this amount is converted to [[kinetic energy]] according to the [[conservation of energy]].  The atom is said to have undergone the process of [[ionization]].

In the event that the electron absorbs a quantity of energy less than the binding energy, it may transition to an [[excited state]] or to a [[Virtual state (physics)|virtual state]]. After a statistically sufficient quantity of time, an electron in an excited state will undergo a transition to a lower state via [[spontaneous emission]]. The change in energy between the two energy levels must be accounted for (conservation of energy). In a neutral atom, the system will emit a photon of the difference in energy.  However, if the lower state is in an inner shell, a phenomenon known as the [[Auger effect]] may take place where the energy is transferred to another bound electrons causing it to go into the continuum. This allows one to multiply ionize an atom with a single photon.

There are strict [[selection rules]] as to the electronic configurations that can be reached by excitation by light—however there are no such rules for excitation by collision processes.

'''Bard College Berlin''' (formerly known as '''ECLA''' or '''European College of Liberal Arts''') is a private, non-profit institution of higher education in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. It was founded as a non-profit association in 1999. The college is, according to [[Martha Nussbaum]], one of the educational institutions in Europe that makes the [[liberal arts]] idea into reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = | last = | title = Teaching Humanity| publisher = [[Newsweek]] | date = Aug 21, 2006| url= http://www.newsweek.com/id/46439}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Students and faculty come from all over the world and the language of instruction is English. Qualifying students earn both an American B.A. and a German B.A.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.berlin.bard.edu/academics/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bard College Berlin was founded as ECLA (a non-profit association) in 1999 under the leadership of Stephan Gutzeit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zeit.de/1999/40/Das_College_im_Kopf/seite-1&lt;/ref&gt; The founding dean was Erika Anita Kiss. The first program to be introduced was the six-week International Summer University. Later two one-year programs were developed and still continue to be offered: the Academy Year and the Project Year. A four-year [[Bachelor of Arts]] program in Humanities, the Arts, and Social Thought was launched in October 2009. In November 2011, ECLA merged with [[Bard College]] in [[Annandale-on-Hudson, New York|Annandale-on-Hudson]], New York, USA, and subsequently became Bard College Berlin, A Liberal Arts University.&lt;ref&gt;http://idw-online.de/de/news562305&lt;/ref&gt; A four-year BA program in Economics, Politics, and Social Thought was introduced in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.berlin.bard.edu/academics/economics-politics-and-social-thought/&lt;/ref&gt;

At Bard College Berlin students may enroll in a BA degree, or in a one-semester or one-year program suitable to their profile, background, and individual aims of study. The college supports internship opportunities and practical training, and has many established connections with the intellectual and cultural life of Berlin. The academic programs currently offered are Bachelor of Arts in Humanities, the Arts, and Social Thought; Bachelor of Arts in Economics, Politics, and Social Thought; Academy Year; Project Year; Arts and Society in Berlin; LAB Berlin; and Begin in Berlin. Every summer the following programs are offered: Summer Theater Intensive, Summer Language Intensive, and Berlin Summer Studio.

In 2016, the Program for International Education and Social Change was introduced, which enables students from areas that are experiencing severe economic, social, and political crisis to access the liberal arts education offered by Bard College Berlin. The program continues a long tradition of Bard College.

Bard College Berlin provides an immersion in intellectual history from ancient Greece to the present day, with rigorous concentration on philosophy, economics, politics, literature, art history, film, and theater and studio arts. The total number of ECTS credits earned is 240. Study of the German language is offered and encouraged. 
&lt;!-- 
ECLA's first one-year programme was introduced in 2002, and continues today in a developed version as the Academy Year Programme. During the Academy Year, students take the first two core courses of the BA degree (Greek Civilization and Medieval Literature and Culture) and their choice of elective seminars. Students may also study languages.&lt;ref&gt;Core Courses in 2012–13: http://www.ecla.de/academics/one-year-programmes/&lt;/ref&gt;

;The Project Year (PY)

Another one-year programme, introduced in 2003, continues today as the Project Year Programme. During this course of study, students pursue an individual project under the supervision of an ECLA of Bard faculty member with relevant expertise. In addition to their individual project, PY students take two core courses. The work culminates with a 25-page essay and an oral presentation of the project to the rest of the school. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecla.de/one-year-programmes/&lt;/ref&gt;
 --&gt;
&lt;!-- 
===Special programmes===
Besides the main academic programmes, ECLA of Bard organises and hosts a week-long conference each year. The programme functions as a forum for inquiry into current affairs, and it has received a [[UNESCO]] award as an event for education in sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;http://swwe.ecla.de/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Previous State of the World Week topics included [[Censorship]] (2012), The Translator (2010), Politics of Cultural Ownership (2009), Water Management (2008),&lt;ref&gt;http://swwe.ecla.de/index.html State of the World Week 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social entrepreneurship]] (2007),&lt;ref&gt;http://swwe.ecla.de/index2.html State of the World Week 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1038">'''Basis pursuit''' is the [[mathematical optimization]] problem of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\min_x \|x\|_1 \quad \mbox{subject to} \quad y = Ax.&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x'' is a ''N'' &amp;times; 1 solution vector (signal), ''y'' is a ''M'' &amp;times; 1 vector of observations (measurements), ''A'' is a ''M''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''N'' transform matrix (usually measurement matrix) and ''M''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''N''.

It is usually applied in cases where there is an underdetermined system of linear equations ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Ax'' that must be exactly satisfied, and the [[Sparse vector|sparsest]] solution in the ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; sense is desired.

When it is desirable to trade off exact congruence of ''Ax'' and ''y'' in exchange for a sparser ''x'', [[basis pursuit denoising]] is preferred.

The '''Centres de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine''' or '''CRNHs''' is a health research organisation based in [[France]]. Its goal is to improve the knowledge on the function properties of food, on metabolism and on human physiology, from basic research to the study of behaviours and their impact on health.  The French territory is now provided with four CRNH having common tools and complementary scientific skills that allow them to develop multi center programs using their platforms and their specific skills.

Nutritional issues are of major importance as populations around the world are considerably changing their diet and lifestyle with large health consequences. Food related-diseases such as [[obesity]], [[Diabetes insipidus|diabetes]], [[cardiovascular disease]]s, [[malnutrition]] and cancers are becoming major public health issues. 
CRNHs is the network of French research centres for human nutrition. CRNHs has the ambition to provide scientific answers to nutrition related health issues by promoting science and accelerating technology transfer to society. CRNHs aims to improve the knowledge on the functional properties of food and particularly its effects on metabolism and on human physiology by developing multi center programs using its platforms and its specific skills. CRNHs contributes to technology transfer between hospital sectors, research laboratories and industries. CRNHs’ expertise, its platforms for clinical exploration, analysis and data processing offer significant opportunities for collaborations. CRNHs develops research programs in nutrition within the framework of national, European and international research programs, working closely with industry partners and researchers worldwide.
To advise on strategic development, CRNHs has been endowed with an external scientific advisory board composed of experts from several European.

'''Calcium [[metabolism]]''' refers to the movements and regulation of [[calcium]] ions (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) ''in'' and ''out'' of various body compartments, such as the [[gastrointestinal tract]], the [[blood plasma]], the [[extracellular fluid|extracellular]] and [[intracellular fluid|intracellular]] fluids, and [[bone tissue]]. An important aspect of calcium metabolism is plasma calcium [[homeostasis]], the regulation of calcium ions in the [[blood plasma]] within [[reference ranges for blood tests#Calcium|narrow limits]].&lt;ref name=Brini&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Marisa | last1 = Brini | first2 = Denis | last2 = Ottolini | first3 = Tito | last3 = Calì | first4 = Ernesto | last4 = Carafoli | editor-first1 = Astrid | editor-last1 = Sigel  | editor-last2 = Helmut | editor-first2 = Roland K.

Calcium in Health and Disease | doi = 10.1007/978-94-007-7500-8_4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this process, [[bone tissue]] acts as a calcium storage center for deposits and withdrawals as needed by the blood, via continual [[bone remodeling]].&lt;ref name=Marieb2000&gt;{{Citation |last=Marieb | first=Elaine | title=Essentials of human anatomy and physiology |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |location=San Francisco |year=2000 |isbn=0805349405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|276–277}}  Derangement of this mechanism leads to [[hypercalcemia]] or [[hypocalcemia]], both of which can have consequences for health. The level of the calcium in humans' plasma is regulated by [[calcitonin]] and [[parathyroid hormone]] (PTH); calcitonin is released by the [[thyroid gland]] once its plasma level is above its set normal point (in order to lower calcium level); PTH is released by the [[parathyroid glands]] when calcium level falls below set point (in order to raise it).

== Calcium concentrations ==

Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the [[Composition of the human body|human body]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The average adult body contains in total approximately 1&amp;nbsp;kg, 99% in the skeleton in the form of [[calcium phosphate]] salts {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. The extracellular fluid (ECF) contains approximately 22&amp;nbsp;mmol, of which about 9&amp;nbsp;mmol is in the [[blood plasma|plasma]].&lt;ref name=diem&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 978-3-9801244-0-9 | vauthors = Diem K, Lenter C | title = Scientific Tables | edition =  Seventh | pages = 653–654 | volume = 565 | location = Basel |  publisher = Ciba-Geigy Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately 10&amp;nbsp;mmol of calcium is exchanged between bone and the ECF over a period of twenty-four hours.&lt;ref name=marshall&gt;{{cite book | last1=Marshall | first1= W. J. |year=1995 |title=Clinical Chemistry | edition = 3rd |publisher=Mosby | location= London | isbn=0-7234-2190-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concentration of calcium ions inside the cells (in the [[Cytosol#Properties and composition|intracellular fluid]]) is more than 7,000 times lower than in the blood plasma (i.e. at &lt;0.0002&amp;nbsp;mmol/L, compared with 1.4&amp;nbsp;mmol/L in the plasma)

== Function ==
{{Main |Calcium in biology}}

Calcium has several main functions in the body. It readily binds to proteins, particularly those with amino acids whose side chains terminate in carboxyl (-COOH) groups (e.g. glutamate residues). When such binding occurs the electrical charges on the protein chain change, causing the protein's tertiary structure (i.e. 3-dimensional form) to change. Good examples of this are several of the [[clotting factors]] in the blood plasma, which are functionless in the absence of calcium ions, but become fully functional on the addition of the correct concentration of calcium salts. The [[Sodium channels|voltage gated sodium ion channels]] in the cell membranes of nerves and muscle are particularly sensitive to the calcium ion concentration in the plasma.&lt;ref name=CMArmstrong1999&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Armstrong CM, Cota G | title = Calcium block of Na+ channels and its effect on closing rate | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 96 | issue = 7 | pages = 4154–7 | date = Mar 1999 | pmid = 10097179 | pmc = 22436 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.7.4154 | bibcode = 1999PNAS...96.4154A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatively small decreases in the plasma ionized calcium levels ([[hypocalcemia]]) cause these channels to leak sodium into the nerve cells or axons, making them hyper-excitable ([[Bathmotropic|positive bathmotropic effect]]), thus causing spontaneous muscle spasms ([[tetany]]) and [[paraesthesia]] (the sensation of "pins and needles") of the extremities and round the mouth.&lt;ref name=harrison&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Harrison TR | title =Principles of Internal Medicine | edition = third | pages = 170, 571–579 | location = New York | publisher =  McGraw-Hill Book Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the plasma ionized calcium rises above normal ([[hypercalcemia]]) more calcium is bound to these sodium channels having a negative bathmotropic effect on them, causing lethargy, muscle weakness, anorexia, constipation and labile emotions.&lt;ref name=harrison /&gt;

Because the intracellular calcium ion concentration is extremely low (see above) the entry of minute quantities of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum or from the extracellular fluids, cause rapid, very marked, and readily reversible changes in the relative concentration of these ions in the [[cytosol]]. This can therefore serve as a very effective intracellular signal (or "[[second messenger]]") in a variety of circumstances, including [[muscle contraction]], the release of hormones (e.g. [[insulin]] from the beta cells in the [[pancreatic islets]]) or neurotransmitters (e.g. [[acetylcholine]] from pre-synaptic terminals of nerves) and other functions.

=== Bones ===
Calcium acts structurally as [[Bone mineral|supporting material]] in bones as [[calcium hydroxyapatite]] (Ca&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

=== Muscles ===
In [[skeletal muscle|skeletal]] and [[heart muscle]] calcium ions, released from the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] (the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] of [[striated muscle tissue|striated muscles]]) binds to the [[troponin C]] protein present on the [[actin]]-containing thin filaments of the [[myofibril]]s. The troponin's [[allosteric regulation|3D structure changes]] as a result,  causing the [[tropomyosin]] to which it is attached to be rolled away from the [[myosin]]-binding sites on the [[Actin|actin molecules]] that form the back-bone of the thin filaments. [[Myosin]] can then bind to the exposed myosin-binding sites on the thin filament, to undergo a repeating series of conformational changes called the [[Sliding filament theory#Cross-bridge mechanism|cross-bridge cycle]], for which [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] provides the energy. During the cycle, each myosin protein ‘paddles’ along the thin actin filament, repeatedly binding to myosin-binding sites along the actin filament, ratcheting and letting go. In effect, the thick filament moves or slides along the thin filament, resulting in [[muscle contraction]]. This process is known as the [[sliding filament model]] of muscle contraction.&lt;ref name="Silverthorn 2016"&gt;{{cite book | last = Silverthorn | first = Dee Unglaub | authorlink = | chapter = Muscles | title = Human Physiology: An Integrated Approach | publisher = Pearson | series = | volume = | edition = 7th | date = 2016 | location = San Francisco, CA | pages = 377–416 | isbn = 0-321-98122-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooke|first1=R.|title=The sliding filament model: 1972-2004|journal=The Journal of General Physiology|year=2004|volume=123|issue=6|pages=643–656|doi=10.1085/jgp.200409089|pmid=15173218|pmc=2234572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geeves|first1=Michael A.|title=Stretching the lever-arm theory|journal=Nature|year=2002|volume=415|issue=6868|pages=129–131|doi=10.1038/415129a|pmid=11805818|bibcode=2002Natur.415..129G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spudich|first1=JA|title=In pursuit of myosin function|journal=Cell Regulation|year=1989|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1–11|pmid=2519609|pmc=361420|doi=10.1091/mbc.1.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yanagida|first1=Toshio|last2=Arata|first2=Toshiaki|last3=Oosawa|first3=Fumio|title=Sliding distance of actin filament induced by a myosin crossbridge during one ATP hydrolysis cycle|journal=Nature|year=1985|volume=316|issue=6026|pages=366–369|doi=10.1038/316366a0|pmid=4022127|bibcode=1985Natur.316..366Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plasma ''total calcium'' concentration is in the range of 2.2-2.6&amp;nbsp;mmol/L (9-10.5&amp;nbsp;mg/dL), and the normal ''ionized calcium'' is 1.3-1.5&amp;nbsp;mmol/L (4.5-5.6&amp;nbsp;mg/dL).&lt;ref name=diem /&gt;  The amount of total calcium in the blood varies with the level of [[Serum albumin|plasma albumin]], the most abundant protein in plasma, and therefore the main carrier of protein-bound calcium in the blood.  The biologic effect of calcium is, however, determined by the amount of ''ionized calcium'', rather than the total calcium.  It is therefore the plasma [[ionized]] calcium level which is [[Homeostasis#Plasma ionized calcium|tightly regulated]] to remain within very narrow limits by homeostatic [[negative feedback]] systems.

Between 35-50% of the calcium in plasma is protein-bound, and 5-10% is in the form of complexes with organic acids and phosphates. The remainder (50-60%) is ionized. The ionized calcium can be determined directly by [[colorimetry]], or it can be read off from [[nomogram]]s, though the usefulness of the latter is limited when the pH and protein content of the plasma deviate widely from the normal.&lt;ref name=diem /&gt;

Not all the calcium in the diet can be readily absorbed from the gut. The calcium that is most readily absorbed is found in dairy product and eggs, as well as in tinned fish products. The calcium contained in vegetable matter is often complexed with [[Phytic acid|phytates]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graf|first1=Ernst|year=1983|title=Calcium binding to phytic acid|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=31|issue=4|pages=851|doi=10.1021/jf00118a045|name-list-format=vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oxalic acid|oxalates]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Watts PS|year=2009|title=Effects of oxalic acid ingestion by sheep.

{{Anchor|The role of bone}}

=== Bone storage ===
Although calcium flow to and from the [[bone]] is neutral, about 5–10&amp;nbsp;mmol is turned over a day. Bone serves as an important storage point for calcium, as it contains 99% of the total body calcium. Calcium release from bone is regulated by [[parathyroid hormone]] in conjunction with [[calcitriol]] manufactured in the kidney under the influence of PTH. [[Calcitonin]] (a hormone secreted by the thyroid gland when plasma ionized calcium levels are high or rising; not to be confused with "calcitriol" which is manufactured in the kidney) stimulates incorporation of calcium into bone.

== Absorption from the intestine ==
The normal adult diet contains about 25&amp;nbsp;[[Mole (unit)|mmol]] of calcium per day. Only about 5&amp;nbsp;mmol of this is absorbed into the body per day (see below).&lt;ref name=ganong&gt;Barrett KE, Barman SM, Boitano S, Brooks H, "Chapter 23. Hormonal Control of Calcium &amp; Phosphate Metabolism &amp; the Physiology of Bone" (Chapter). Barrett KE, Barman SM, Boitano S, Brooks H: Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology, 23e: http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=5244785 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707075939/http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=5244785# |date=2011-07-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Calcium is absorbed across the intestinal epithelial cell's [[brush border]] membrane and is immediately bound to [[calbindin]], a [[vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein]]. Calbindin transfers the calcium directly into the epithelial cell's [[endoplasmic reticulum]], through which the calcium is transferred to the [[Epithelial cell#Basement membrane|basal membrane]] on the opposite side of the cell, without entering its [[cytosol]] or intracellular fluid. From there [[TRPV6|protein-coding gene TRPV6]] and calcium pumps ([[Plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase|PMCA1]]) [[Active transport|actively transport]] calcium into the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Balesaria S, Sangha S, Walters JR | title = Human duodenum responses to vitamin D metabolites of TRPV6 and other genes involved in calcium absorption | journal = American Journal of Physiology. Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology | volume = 297 | issue = 6 | pages = G1193-7 | date = Dec 2009 | pmid = 19779013 | pmc = 2850091 | doi = 10.1152/ajpgi.00237.2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Active transport of calcium occurs primarily in the [[duodenum]] portion of the intestine when calcium intake is low; and through passive [[paracellular transport]] in the [[jejunum]] and [[ileum]] parts when calcium intake is high, independently of Vitamin D level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/digestion/smallgut/absorb_minerals.html|title=Absorption of Minerals and Metals|author=|date=|website=www.vivo.colostate.edu|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The active absorption of calcium from the gut is regulated by the [[calcitriol]] (or 1,25&amp;nbsp;dihydroxycholecalciferol, or 1,25&amp;nbsp;dihydroxyvitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) concentration in the blood. Calcitriol is a cholesterol derivative. Under the influence of ultraviolet light on the skin, cholesterol is converted to previtamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; which spontaneously isomerizes to vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (or cholecaliferol). It is then converted from cholecaliferol to calcifediol in the liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandi|first=M.L.|date=2010|title=Indications on the use of vitamin D and vitamin D metabolites in clinical phenotypes|journal=Clinical Cases in Mineral and Bone Metabolism|volume=7|issue=3|pages=243–250|issn=1724-8914|pmc=3213838|pmid=22460535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of [[parathyroid hormone]], the [[kidneys]] convert calcifediol into the active hormone calcitriol, which acts on the epithelial cells ([[Enterocyte|enterocytes]]) lining the small intestine to increase the rate of absorption of calcium from the intestinal contents. In short the cycle is following:
: &lt;p class="center"&gt;[[Cholesterol]] {{overset|[[ultraviolet]]|→}} [[Previtamin D3|Previtamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] {{overset|isomerization|→}} [[cholecalciferol|Vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] {{overset|Liver|→}} [[Calcifediol]] {{overset|[[Parathyroid hormone|PTH]] + Kidneys|→}} [[Calcitriol]]&lt;/p&gt; 

Low PTH levels in the blood (which occur under physiological conditions when the plasma ionized calcium levels are high) inhibit the conversion of cholecalciferol into calcitriol, which in turn inhibits calcium absorption from the gut. The opposite happens when the plasma ionized calcium levels are low: parathyroid hormone is secreted into the blood and the kidneys convert more calcifediol into the active calcitriol, increasing calcium absorption from the gut.&lt;ref name="stryer"&gt;Stryer L. ''Biochemistry'' (Fourth Edition). Chapter 27 "Vitamin D is derived from cholesterol by the ring-splitting action of light". New York, W.H. Freeman and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reabsorption ==
Since about 15&amp;nbsp;mmol of calcium is excreted into the intestine via the bile per day,&lt;ref name="diem" /&gt; the total amount of calcium that reaches the duodenum and jejunum each day is about 40&amp;nbsp;mmol (25&amp;nbsp;mmol from the diet plus 15&amp;nbsp;mmol from the bile), of which, on average, 20&amp;nbsp;mmol is absorbed (back) into the blood. The net result is that about 5&amp;nbsp;mmol more calcium is absorbed from the gut than is excreted into it via the bile. If there is no active bone building (as in childhood), or increased need for calcium during pregnancy and lactation, the 5&amp;nbsp;mmol calcium that is absorbed from the gut makes up for urinary losses that are only partially regulated.&lt;ref name="ganong" /&gt;

=== The kidneys ===

The [[kidney]] filters 250&amp;nbsp;mmol of calcium ions a day in pro-urine (or [[glomerular filtrate]]), and resorbs 245&amp;nbsp;mmol, leading to a net average loss in the urine of about 5&amp;nbsp;mmol/d. The quantity of calcium ions excreted in the urine per day is partially under the influence of the plasma [[parathyroid hormone]] (PTH) level - high levels of PTH decreasing the rate of calcium ion excretion, and low levels increasing it.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The main determinant of the amount of calcium excreted into the urine per day is the plasma ionized calcium concentration. The plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration only increases or decreases the amount of calcium excreted at any ''given plasma ionized calcium concentration''. Thus, in primary [[hyperparathyroidism]] the quantity of calcium excreted in the urine per day is ''increased'' despite the high levels of PTH in the blood. This is because hyperparathyroidism results in [[hypercalcemia]], which increases the urinary calcium concentration ([[hypercalcuria]]) despite the modestly increased rate of calcium re-absorption from the renal tubules caused by PTH's effect on those tubules. [[Renal stones]] are therefore often a first indication of hyperparathyroidism, especially since the hypercalcuria is accompanied by an increase in urinary phosphate excretion (a direct result of the high plasma PTH levels). Together the calcium and phosphate tend to precipitate out as water-insoluble salts, which readily form solid “stones”.&lt;/ref&gt; However, parathyroid hormone has a greater effect on the quantity of [[phosphate|phosphate ions]] (HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) excreted in the urine.&lt;ref name="pmid25287933" /&gt; Phosphates form insoluble salts in combination with calcium ions.  High concentrations of HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; in the plasma, therefore, lower the ionized calcium level in the extra-cellular fluids. Thus, the excretion of more phosphate than calcium ions in the urine raises the plasma ionized calcium level, even though the total calcium concentration might be lowered. The kidney influences the plasma ionized calcium concentration in yet another manner. It processes [[vitamin D]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; into [[calcitriol]], the active form that is most effective in promoting the intestinal absorption of calcium. This conversion of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; into calcitriol, is also promoted by high plasma parathyroid hormone levels.&lt;ref name="stryer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tortora GJ, Anagnostakos NP. ''Principles of Anatomy and Physiology'' (Fifth Edition) p. 696. New York, Harper &amp; Row Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Excretion ==
Most excretion of excess calcium is via the bile and feces, because the plasma calcitriol levels (which ultimately depend on the plasma calcium levels) regulate how much of the biliary calcium is reabsorbed from the intestinal contents. Urinary excretion of calcium is relatively modest (about 5&amp;nbsp;mmol/day) in comparison to what can be excreted via the feces (15&amp;nbsp;mmol/day).

{{Anchor|Regulation of calcium metabolism}}

== Calcium metabolism regulation ==
[[File:Calcium regulation.png|thumb|250px|[[Human homeostasis#Calcium|Calcium regulation]] in the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Parathyroid Glands and Vitamin D |author1=Boron, Walter F. |author2=Boulpaep, Emile L |title=Medical Physiology: A Cellular And Molecular Approach |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |year=2003 |isbn=1-4160-2328-3 |page=1094}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The plasma ionized calcium concentration is regulated within narrow limits (1.3–1.5&amp;nbsp;mmol/L). This is achieved by both the  [[parafollicular cells]] of the thyroid gland, and the [[parathyroid glands]] constantly sensing (i.e. measuring) the concentration of calcium ions in the blood flowing through them. 

=== High plasma level ===
When the concentration rises the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland increase their secretion of [[calcitonin]] (a proteinaceous hormone) into the blood. At the same time the parathyroid glands reduce their rate of parathyroid hormone (or PTH, also a proteinaceous hormone) secretion into the blood. The resulting high levels of calcitonin in the blood stimulate the skeleton to remove calcium from the blood plasma, and deposit it as bone.

The reduced levels of PTH inhibit removal of calcium from the skeleton. The low levels of PTH have several other effects: they increase the loss of calcium in the urine, but more importantly inhibit the loss of phosphate ions via that route. Phosphate ions will therefore be retained in the plasma where they form insoluble salts with calcium ions, thereby removing them from the ionized calcium pool in the blood. The low levels of PTH also inhibit the formation of [[calcitriol]] (not to be confused with [[calcitonin]]) from cholecalciferol (vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) by the kidneys. 

The reduction in the blood calcitriol concentration acts (comparatively slowly) on the epithelial cells ([[enterocyte]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s) of the duodenum inhibiting their ability to absorb calcium from the intestinal contents.&lt;ref name="Brini" /&gt;&lt;ref name="marshall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walter"&gt;{{cite book |author=Walter F. |title=Medical Physiology: A Cellular And Molecular Approach |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |location= |year=2003|chapter=The Parathyroid Glands and Vitamin D in: |page=1094 |isbn=1-4160-2328-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guyton"&gt;Guyton A (1976). ‘’Medical Physiology’’. p.1062; New York, Saunders and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; The low calcitriol levels also act on bone causing the [[osteoclast]]s to release fewer calcium ions into the blood plasma.&lt;ref name="pmid25287933"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blaine J, Chonchol M, Levi M |title=Renal control of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium homeostasis |journal=Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology |volume=10 |issue=7 |pages=1257–72 |year=2015 |pmid=25287933 |doi=10.2215/CJN.09750913|pmc=4491294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Low plasma level ===
When the plasma ionized calcium level is low or falls the opposite happens. Calcitonin secretion is inhibited and PTH secretion is stimulated, resulting in calcium being removed from bone to rapidly correct the plasma calcium level. The high plasma PTH levels inhibit calcium loss via the urine while stimulating the excretion of phosphate ions via that route. They also stimulate the kidneys to manufacture calcitriol (a steroid hormone), which enhances the ability of the cells lining the gut to absorb calcium from the intestinal contents into the blood, by stimulating the production of [[calbindin]] in these cells. The PTH stimulated production of calcitriol also causes calcium to be released from bone into the blood, by the release of [[RANKL]] (a [[cytokine]], or [[Paracrine|local hormone]]) from the [[osteoblast]]s which increases the bone resorptive activity by the osteoclasts. These are, however, a relatively slow processes&lt;ref name="Brini" /&gt;&lt;ref name="marshall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25287933" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guyton" /&gt;

Thus fast short term regulation of the plasma ionized calcium level primarily involves rapid movements of calcium into or out of the skeleton. Longer term regulation is achieved by regulating the amount of calcium absorbed from the gut or lost via the feces.&lt;ref name="Brini" /&gt;&lt;ref name="marshall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guyton" /&gt;

== Pathology ==
{{main|Disorders of calcium metabolism}}

[[Hypocalcemia]] (low blood calcium) and [[hypercalcemia]] (high blood calcium) are both serious medical disorders.  [[Osteoporosis]], [[osteomalacia]] and [[rickets]] are bone disorders linked to calcium metabolism disorders and effects of [[vitamin D]].  [[Renal osteodystrophy]] is a consequence of [[chronic renal failure]] related to the calcium metabolism.

A low calcium intake may be a risk factor in the development of [[osteoporosis]] in later life.  In one [[meta-analysis]], the authors found that in fifty out of the fifty-two studies that they reviewed, a diet adequately rich in calcium reduced calcium loss from bone with advancing (post-[[menopausal]]) age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Heaney RP|date=Apr 2000|title=Calcium, dairy products and osteoporosis|url=http://www.jacn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10759135|journal=Journal of the American College of Nutrition|volume=19|issue=2 Suppl|pages=83S-99S|doi=10.1080/07315724.2000.10718088|pmid=10759135}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A diet with sustained adequate amounts of calcium reduced the risk of osteoporosis.

== Research into cancer prevention ==

The role that calcium might have in reducing the rates of colorectal cancer has been the subject of many studies. However, given its modest efficacy, there is no current medical recommendation to use calcium for cancer reduction.
Several epidemiological studies suggest that people with high calcium intake have a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. These observations have been confirmed by experimental studies in volunteers and in rodents. One large scale clinical trial shows that 1.2 g calcium each day reduces, modestly, intestinal polyps recurrence in volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baron JA, Beach M, Mandel JS, van Stolk RU, Haile RW, Sandler RS, Rothstein R, Summers RW, Snover DC, Beck GJ, Bond JH, Greenberg ER | title = Calcium supplements for the prevention of colorectal adenomas.

'''The Center for the Development of Recycling''' (CDR), also known as the County of Santa Clara Recycling Hotline, is a university-based, non-profit, environmental research and service organization. The CDR is located in the Department of [[Environmental Studies]] office at [[San Jose State University]] (SJSU).&lt;ref name="sjsu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/EnvStudies/beyond-class/index.htm |title=San Jose State University Environmental Studies Department |publisher=Sjsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faculty-managed students work on recycling-related projects for the community.&lt;ref name="sjsufoundation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sjsufoundation.org/html/sjsuf-news-info/case-studies.htm |title=SJSU Research Foundation - Case Studies |publisher=Sjsufoundation.org |date=2011-12-18 |accessdate=2012-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508055347/http://www.sjsufoundation.org/html/sjsuf-news-info/case-studies.htm |archivedate=2012-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This organization not only provides the community with a recycling service, but also provides a service-learning opportunity to students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svtc.org/about-us/staff/ |title=Staff and Board – Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition |publisher=Svtc.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
CDR operates with a part-time Director, two compensated part-time students who serve as Administrative Manager and Project Manager, and a staff of student interns who earn academic credit for community service learning. The CDR Director is a Department of Environmental Studies faculty member who is responsible for all activities including management of staff, projects, equipment, budget, and adherence to University regulations. The San Jose State University Foundation manages accounting and payroll services.&lt;ref name="recyclestuff"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recyclestuff.org/about.php |title=Center for the Development of Recycling |publisher=Recyclestuff.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831200037/http://www.recyclestuff.org/about.php |archivedate=2012-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Website==
The CDR’s website assists users to find locations for recycling, reuse, and the donation of goods. It contains specific services available from over 1200 companies and local government for over 2000 product and material types.  Links and documents are provided to assist users with access to multiple information sources that address nearly any question about recycling and waste management.  The site features specific information about recycling and reuse services provided by private business, local government, landfills, and extensive information resources in this expanding field.

==History==
The CDR was founded in 1989 by Bruce Olszewski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/EnvStudies/about/faculty/olszewski.htm |title=Bruce Olszewski Bio |publisher=Sjsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, CDR bridged personnel and equipment resources of SJSU with [[Santa Clara County]] and its 15 cities that resulted in an alliance to provide cost-effective recycling information services for County residents and businesses that also created student service-learning opportunities. In 1992, the CDR began operating the County of Santa Clara Recycling Hotline. CDR added a donor funded website in 1999.&lt;ref name="recyclestuff" /&gt; In 2017, CDR expanded its organization to include the County of San Mateo.

==Recycling Hotline==
Since 1992,&lt;ref name="recyclestuff" /&gt; the CDR has operated the County of Santa Clara Recycling Hotline under contract with the County of Santa Clara.&lt;ref name="sjsu" /&gt; The hotline was created to assist residents with finding a reuse or recycling center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sanjoseca.gov/esd/pollution-prevention/e-waste.asp |title=Pollution Prevention for Residents: E-waste |publisher=Sanjoseca.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609104312/http://www.sanjoseca.gov/ESD/pollution-prevention/e-waste.asp |archivedate=2012-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for any recyclable item they may have.&lt;ref name="sccgov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sccgov.org/portal/site/iwm/agencychp?path=%2Fv7%2FIntegrated%20Waste%20Management%20%28DIV%29%2FRecycling%20Hotline |title=The County of Santa Clara - Office of Integrated Waste Management |publisher=Sccgov.org |date=2012-08-03 |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student-operated hotline serves the 16 jurisdictions of Santa Clara County&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creec.edgateway.net/cs/creecp/view/creec_org/590 |title=CREEC - Center for Development of Recycling, San Jose State University |publisher=Creec.edgateway.net |date=2003-05-14 |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which include:

Founded in 1975, the '''Committee to Ratify the Massachusetts State Equal Rights Amendment''' sought to replace the [[Massachusetts]] State ERA Coalition and carry out the mission of ratifying the [[Equal Rights Amendment]]. The Committee to Ratify the Massachusetts State Equal Rights Amendment replaced the Massachusetts State ERA Coalition because, as a coalition, the organization could not legally raise funds for any cause. The campaign created by the Committee ended with success at the ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu//oasis/deliver/deepLink?_collection=oasis&amp;uniqueId=sch00522|title=Committee to Ratify the Massachusetts State Equal Rights Amendment. Records of the Committee to Ratify the Massachusetts State Equal Rights Amendment, 1975-1976: A Finding Aid|website=oasis.lib.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee then became the ERA Implementation Project, which lobbied for reconciliation of existing laws with the ERA vis a vis legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.library.harvard.edu/schlesinger_equal_rights_amendment |title=Home - Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) - Research Guides at Harvard Library |publisher=Guides.library.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Universe expansion-en.svg|thumb|The [[Big Bang]] theory, which states that the universe originally expanded from high or infinite density, is widely accepted by physicists.]]
'''Cosmogony''' is any model concerning the origin of either the [[cosmos]] or [[universe]].&lt;ref name=DicAstro&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=A Dictionary of Astronomy |last=Ridpath |first=Ian |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CosmoToday&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cosmogony Today |last=Woolfson |first=Michael Mark |author-link=Michael Woolfson |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=20 |year=1979 |issue=2 |pages=97–114|bibcode = 1979QJRAS..20...97W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Developing a complete theoretical model has implications in both the [[philosophy of science]] and [[epistemology]].

==Etymology==
The word comes from the [[Koine Greek]] κοσμογονία (from κόσμος "[[cosmos]], the world") and the root of γί(γ)νομαι / γέγονα ("come into a new state of being").&lt;ref name="TU-20140917"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=γίγνομαι - come into a new state of being |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ge/gona&amp;la=greek |date= |work=[[Tufts University]] |accessdate=17 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[astronomy]], cosmogony refers to the study of the origin of particular astrophysical objects or systems, and is most commonly used in reference to the origin of the Universe, the Solar System, or the Earth–Moon system.&lt;ref name=DicAstro/&gt;&lt;ref name=CosmoToday/&gt;

==Overview==
The [[Big Bang]] theory is the prevailing [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[scientific theory|model]] of the early development of the [[universe]].&lt;ref name="Wollack"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wollack|first=Edward J.|title=Cosmology: The Study of the Universe|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/|work=Universe 101: Big Bang Theory|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=27 April 2011|date=10 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514230003/http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/|archivedate=14 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The most commonly held view is that the universe originates in a  [[gravitational singularity]], which [[inflation (cosmology)|expanded extremely rapidly]] from its hot and dense state. 

[[File:Calabi-Yau.png|thumb|left|200px|Projection of a [[Calabi–Yau manifold]] from [[string theory]]. In quantum physics, there remain different, plausible theories regarding what combination of "stuff", space, or time emerged along with the singularity (and therefore this universe).&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt; The main disagreement among theories is whether [[time]] existed "before" the emergence of our universe or not.]]
Cosmologist and science communicator [[Sean M. Carroll]] explains two competing types of explanations for the origins of the singularity which is the main disagreement between the scientists who study cosmogony and centers on the question of whether [[time]] existed "before" the emergence of our universe or not. One cosmogonical view sees time as fundamental and even eternal: The universe could have contained the singularity because the universe evolved or changed from a prior state (the prior state was "empty space", or maybe a state that could not be called "space" at all). The other view, held by proponents like [[Stephen Hawking]], says that there was no change through time because "time" itself emerged along with this universe (in other words, there can be no "prior" to the universe).&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2012/04/28/a-universe-from-nothing/|title=A Universe from Nothing?, by Sean Carroll, Discover Magazine Blogs, 28 April 2012.|publisher=|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it remains unclear what combination of "stuff", space, or time emerged with the singularity and this universe.&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt;

One problem in cosmogony is that there is currently no theoretical model that explains the earliest moments of the universe's existence (during the [[Planck time]]) because of a lack of a testable theory of [[quantum gravity]]. Researchers in [[string theory]] and its extensions (for example, [[M theory]]), and of [[loop quantum cosmology]], have nevertheless proposed solutions of the type just discussed.

==Compared with cosmology==
{{quote box
|Cosmology is the study of the structure and changes in the present universe, while the scientific field of cosmogony is concerned with the origin of the universe. Observations about our present universe may not only allow predictions to be made about the future, but they also provide clues to events that happened long ago when ... the cosmos began. So the work of cosmologists and cosmogonists overlaps.
|salign = right
|source = [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genesismission.jpl.nasa.gov/educate/scimodule/Cosmogony/CosmogonyPDF/CosCosmolTT.pdf|format=PDF|title=Cosmic Chemistry: Cosmogony  : Teacher Text : Background Information|publisher=Genesismission.jpl.nasa.gov|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|width  = 30em
|align  = right
}}

Cosmogony can be distinguished from [[cosmology]], which studies the universe at large and throughout its existence, and which technically does not inquire directly into the source of its origins. There is some ambiguity between the two terms. For example, the [[cosmological argument]] from [[theology]] regarding the existence of [[God]] is technically an appeal to cosmogonical rather than cosmological ideas. In practice, there is a [[science|scientific]] distinction between cosmological and cosmogonical ideas. [[Physical cosmology]] is the science that attempts to explain all [[observation]]s relevant to the development and characteristics of the universe as a whole. Questions regarding why the universe behaves in such a way have been described by physicists and cosmologists as being extra-[[Scientific method|scientific]] (i.e., [[metaphysics|metaphysical]]), though [[speculation]]s are made from a variety of perspectives that include [[extrapolation]] of scientific theories to untested regimes (i.e., at [[Planck scale]]s), and [[philosophical]] or [[religious]] ideas.

==Theoretical scenarios==
Cosmogonists have only tentative theories for the early stages of the universe and its beginning.  {{as of|2011}}, no accelerator experiments probe energies of sufficient magnitude to provide any experimental insight into the behavior of matter at the energy levels that prevailed shortly after the [[Big Bang]].  

Proposed theoretical scenarios differ radically, and include [[string theory]] and [[M-theory]], the [[Hartle–Hawking initial state]], [[string landscape]], [[Cosmic inflation|brane inflation]], the Big Bang, and the [[ekpyrotic universe]]. Some of these models are mutually compatible, whereas others are not.

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}

In [[computer]]s and [[computer network]]s an '''attack''' is any attempt to expose, alter, disable, destroy, steal or gain unauthorized access to or make unauthorized use of an [[Asset (computer security)|Asset]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c041933_ISO_IEC_27000_2009.zip|title=Publicly Available Standards|first=ISO (International Organization for|last=Standardization)|website=standards.iso.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''cyberattack''' is any type of offensive maneuver that targets computer information systems, infrastructures, computer networks, or personal computer devices. Depending on context, cyberattacks can be labeled as a [[cyber campaign]], [[cyberwarfare]] or [[cyberterrorism]]. A cyberattack can be employed by nation-states, individuals, groups, society or organizations. A cyberattack may originate from an anonymous source. 

A cyberattack may steal, alter, or destroy a specified target by [[Security hacker|hacking]] into a susceptible system.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=2765010|title=Financial Weapons of War|first=Lin, Tom C.|last=W.|date=14 April 2016|website=ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyberattacks can range from installing [[spyware]] on a personal computer to attempting to destroy the infrastructure of entire nations. Legal experts are seeking to limit the use of the term to incidents causing physical damage, distinguishing it from the more routine [[data breach]]es and broader [[security hacker|hacking]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=SATTER|first1=RAPHAEL|title=What makes a cyberattack?

Cyberattacks have become increasingly sophisticated and dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;S. Karnouskos: ''[http://papers.duckdns.org/files/2011_IECON_stuxnet.pdf Stuxnet Worm Impact on Industrial Cyber-Physical System Security].'' In:''37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society (IECON 2011), Melbourne, Australia'', 7-10 Nov 2011. Retrieved 20 Apr 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[User behavior analytics]] and [[Security information and event management|SIEM]] can be used to help prevent these attacks.

== Definitions ==

Since the late 1980s cyberattacks have evolved several times to use innovations in [[information technology]] as vectors for committing [[cybercrimes]]. In recent years, the scale and robustness of cyberattacks has increased rapidly, as observed by the [[World Economic Forum]] in its 2018 report: "Offensive cyber capabilities are developing more rapidly than our ability to deal with hostile incidents."&lt;ref name=WEF18&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GRR18_Report.pdf |title=The Global Risks Report 2018 13th Edition| last=World Economic Forum|first=|year=2018|website=World Economic Forum |archive-url=http://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0SO8059UHNayxUAEERXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTByM3V1YTVuBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMzBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1517535485/RO=10/RU=http%3a%2f%2fwww3.weforum.org%2fdocs%2fWEF_GRR18_Report.pdf/RK=2/RS=OjBArY0ogXUmTKL6f4S98iBGWh8- |archive-date=May 23, 2018 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2000, the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] defined attack in RFC 2828 as:&lt;ref name=rfc2828&gt;{{cite IETF |rfc=2828 |title=Internet Security Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''an [[assault]] on system security that derives from an intelligent [[threat (computer)|threat]], i.e., an intelligent act that is a deliberate attempt (especially in the sense of a method or technique) to evade [[Security service (telecommunication)|security service]]s and violate the [[security policy]] of a system.''

&lt;/ref&gt; has led to new terms like ''cyber attack'' and ''[[cyberwarfare]]''.

CNSS Instruction No. 4009&lt;ref name=CNSSI4009/&gt; define a ''cyber attack'' as:

:''An attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise’s use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information.''

== Prevalence ==
&lt;!-- this is a section which is meant to cover the historical and "present" prevalence of cyberattacks, information which appears to be useful but not covered in article at the tims of this section creation. --&gt;In the first six months of 2017, two billion data records were stolen or impacted by cyberattacks, and [[ransomware]] payments reached {{US$|2 billion}}, double that in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/will-ai-save-us-from-the-next-cyber-attack/88428|title=Will Artificial Intelligence Save Us From the Next Cyberattack?|last=Fosco|first=Molly|date=30 October 2018|work=OZY|access-date=30 October 2018|department=Fast Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism ==
{{Main|Cyberwarfare|Cyberterrorism}}
Cyberwarfare utilizes techniques of defending and attacking information and computer networks that inhabit cyberspace, often through a prolonged [[cyber campaign]] or series of related campaigns. It denies an opponent's ability to do the same, while employing technological instruments of war to attack an opponent's critical computer systems. Cyberterrorism, on the other hand, is "the use of computer network tools to shut down critical national infrastructures (such as energy, transportation, government operations) or to coerce or intimidate a government or civilian population".&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James. United States. Center for Strategic and International Studies. Assessing the Risks of Cyber Terrorism, Cyber War and Other Cyber Threats. Washington, D.C.: , 2002. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; That means the end result of both cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism is the same, to damage critical infrastructures and computer systems linked together within the confines of cyberspace.

== Factors ==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2014}}
Three factors contribute to why cyber-attacks are launched against a state or an individual: the fear factor, spectacularity factor, and vulnerability factor.

=== Spectacularity factor ===
The spectacularity factor is a measure of the actual damage achieved by an attack, meaning that the attack creates direct losses (usually loss of availability or loss of income) and garners negative publicity. On February 8, 2000, a Denial of Service attack severely reduced traffic to many major sites, including Amazon, Buy.com, CNN, and eBay (the attack continued to affect still other sites the next day).&lt;ref name = "DOS_ex"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.garykessler.net/library/ddos.html|title=Distributed Denial-Of-Service|website=www.garykessler.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazon reportedly estimated the loss of business at $600,000.&lt;ref name = "DOS_ex" /&gt;

=== Vulnerability factor ===
Vulnerability factor exploits how vulnerable an organization or government establishment is to cyber-attacks. An organization can be vulnerable to a denial of service attack, and a government establishment can be defaced on a web page. A computer network attack disrupts the integrity or authenticity of data, usually through malicious code that alters program logic that controls data, leading to errors in output.&lt;ref name=linden&gt;Linden, Edward. Focus on Terrorism. New York: [[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]], 2007. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional hackers to cyberterrorists ==
{{original research|section|date=March 2015}}
Professional hackers, either working on their own or employed by the government or military service, can find computer systems with vulnerabilities lacking the appropriate security software. Once found, they can infect systems with malicious code and then remotely control the system or computer by sending commands to view content or to disrupt other computers. There needs to be a pre-existing system flaw within the computer such as no antivirus protection or faulty system configuration for the viral code to work. Many professional hackers will promote themselves to cyberterrorists where a new set of rules govern their actions. Cyberterrorists have premeditated plans and their attacks are not born of rage. They need to develop their plans step-by-step and acquire the appropriate software to carry out an attack. They usually have political agendas, targeting political structures. Cyber terrorists are hackers with a political motivation, their attacks can impact political structure through this corruption and destruction.&lt;ref name=prichard&gt;Prichard, Janet, and Laurie MacDonald. "Cyber Terrorism: A Study of the Extent of Coverage in Computer Security Textbooks." Journal of Information Technology Education. 3. (2004): n. page. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  They also target civilians, civilian interests and civilian installations. As previously stated cyberterrorists attack persons or property and cause enough harm to generate fear.

== Types of attack ==
An attack can be ''active'' or ''passive''.&lt;ref name=rfc2828/&gt;

: An "active attack" attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation.
: A "[[passive attack]]" attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources (e.g., [[telephone tapping|wiretapping]]).
An attack can be perpetrated by an ''insider'' or from'' outside'' the organization;&lt;ref name=rfc2828/&gt;
: An "inside attack" is an attack initiated by an entity inside the security perimeter (an "insider"), i.e., an entity that is authorized to access system resources but uses them in a way not approved by those who granted the authorization.
: An "outside attack" is initiated from outside the perimeter, by an unauthorized or illegitimate user of the system (an "outsider"). In the Internet, potential outside attackers range from amateur pranksters to organized criminals, international terrorists, and hostile governments.

The term "attack" relates to some other basic security terms as shown in the following diagram:&lt;ref name=rfc2828/&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

A resource (both physical or logical), called an [[asset (computing)|asset]], can have one or more [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] that can be [[Exploit (computer security)|exploited]] by a [[Threat (computer)|threat]] agent in a threat action. As a result, the [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]] or [[availability]] of resources may be compromised. Potentially, the damage may extend to resources in addition to the one initially identified as vulnerable, including further resources of the organization, and the resources of other involved parties (customers, suppliers).

The so-called [[CIA triad]] is the basis of [[information security]].

The attack can be ''active'' when it attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation: so it compromises integrity or availability. A "''passive attack''" attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources: so it compromises confidentiality.

A threat is a potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a circumstance, capability, action, or event that could breach security and cause harm. That is, a threat is a possible danger that might exploit a vulnerability. A threat can be either "intentional" (i.e., intelligent; e.g., an individual cracker or a criminal organization) or "accidental" (e.g., the possibility of a computer malfunctioning, or the possibility of an "act of God" such as an earthquake, a fire, or a tornado).&lt;ref name=rfc2828/&gt;

A set of policies concerned with information security management, the [[information security management system]]s (ISMS), has been developed to manage, according to [[risk management]] principles, the [[Countermeasure (computer)|countermeasures]] in order to accomplish to a security strategy set up following rules and regulations applicable in a country.&lt;ref name=Vacca&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

An attack should led to a ''security incident'' i.e. a ''security event'' that involves a ''security violation''. In other words, a security-relevant system event in which the system's security policy is disobeyed or otherwise breached.

The overall picture represents the [[Risk factor (computing)|risk factors]] of the risk scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Research/Documents/RiskIT-FW-18Nov09-Research.pdf|title=ISACA THE RISK IT FRAMEWORK (registration required)|work=isaca.org|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An organization should make steps to detect, classify and manage security incidents. The first logical step is to set up an [[incident response]] plan and eventually a [[computer emergency response team]].

In order to detect attacks, a number of [[countermeasure (computer)|countermeasures]] can be set up at organizational, procedural and technical levels. [[Computer emergency response team]], [[information technology security audit]] and [[intrusion detection system]] are example of these.&lt;ref name=Vacca1&gt;{{cite book

An attack usually is perpetrated by someone with bad intentions: [[Hacker (computer security)|black hatted]] attacks falls in this category, while other perform [[penetration test]]ing on an organization information system to find out if all foreseen controls are in place.

The attacks can be classified according to their origin: i.e. if it is conducted using one or more computers: in the last case is called a distributed attack. [[Botnet]]s are used to conduct distributed attacks.

Other classifications are according to the procedures used or the type of vulnerabilities exploited: attacks can be concentrated on network mechanisms or host features.

Some attacks are physical: i.e. theft or damage of computers and other equipment. Others are attempts to force changes in the logic used by computers or network protocols in order to achieve unforeseen (by the original designer) result but useful for the attacker. Software used to for logical attacks on computers is called [[malware]].

== Syntactic attacks ==
[[File:Intrusion Kill Chain - v2.png|thumb|right|350px|Intrusion [[kill chain]] for information security&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/spawar/Press/Documents/Publications/03.26.15_USSenate.pdf|title=U.S. Senate-Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation-A "Kill Chain" Analysis of the 2013 Target Data Breach-March 26, 2014|website=navy.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In detail, there are a number of techniques to utilize in cyber-attacks and a variety of ways to administer them to individuals or establishments on a broader scale. Attacks are broken down into two categories: syntactic attacks and semantic attacks. '''Syntactic attacks''' are straightforward; it is considered malicious software which includes viruses, worms, and Trojan horses.

=== Viruses ===
A virus is a self-replicating program that can attach itself to another program or file in order to reproduce. The virus can hide in unlikely locations in the memory of a computer system and attach itself to whatever file it sees fit to execute its code. It can also change its digital footprint each time it replicates making it harder to track down in the computer.

=== Worms ===
A worm does not need another file or program to copy itself; it is a self-sustaining running program. Worms replicate over a network using protocols. The latest incarnation of worms make use of known vulnerabilities in systems to penetrate, execute their code, and replicate to other systems such as the Code Red II worm that infected more than 259 000 systems in less than 14 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Janczewski, Lech, and Andrew Colarik. Cyber Warfare and Cyber Terrorism. Hershey, New York: Information Science Reference, 2008. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; On a much larger scale, worms can be designed for industrial espionage to monitor and collect server and traffic activities then transmit it back to its creator.

=== Trojan horses ===
A Trojan horse is designed to perform legitimate tasks but it also performs unknown and unwanted activity. It can be the basis of many viruses and worms installing onto the computer as keyboard loggers and backdoor software. In a commercial sense, Trojans can be imbedded in trial versions of software and can gather additional intelligence about the target without the person even knowing it happening. All three of these are likely to attack an individual and establishment through emails, web browsers, chat clients, remote software, and updates.

== Semantic attacks ==
'''Semantic attack''' is the modification and dissemination of correct and incorrect information. Information modified could have been done without the use of computers even though new opportunities can be found by using them. To set someone into the wrong direction or to cover your tracks, the dissemination of incorrect information can be utilized.

=== India and Pakistan ===
{{Main|India–Pakistan relations}}
There were two such instances between India and Pakistan that involved cyberspace conflicts, started in 1990s. Earlier cyber attacks came to known as early as in 1999.&lt;ref name=prichard /&gt; Since then, India and Pakistan were engaged in a long-term dispute over Kashmir which moved into [[cyberspace]]. Historical accounts indicated that each country's hackers have been repeatedly involved in attacking each other's computing database system. The number of attacks has grown yearly: 45 in 1999, 133 in 2000, 275 by the end of August 2001.&lt;ref name=prichard /&gt; In 2010, Indian hackers laid a cyber attack at least 36 government database websites going by the name "Indian Cyber Army".&lt;ref name="Express Tirbune"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|title=Cyber Indian Army|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/83967/36-government-websites-hacked-by-indian-cyber-army/|accessdate=8 June 2013|newspaper=Express Tirbune|date=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Indian hackers hacked the official website of [[Election Commission of Pakistan|Election Commission]] of Pakistan in an attempt to retrieve sensitive database information.&lt;ref name="The News International 2013" /&gt; In retaliation, Pakistani hackers, calling themselves "True Cyber Army" hacked and defaced ~1,059 websites of Indian election bodies.&lt;ref name="The News International 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Waseem Abbasi|title=Pakistani hackers defaced over 1,000 Indian websites|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-22095-Pakistani-hackers-defaced-over-1000-Indian-websites|accessdate=8 June 2013|newspaper=The News International 2013|date=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the media, Pakistan's has been working on effective [[cyber security]] system, in a program called the "Cyber Secure Pakistan" (CSP).&lt;ref name="The News International, April 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|title=Cyber Secure Pakistan' initiative launched|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-6-172840-Cyber-Secure-Pakistan-initiative-launched|accessdate=10 June 2013|newspaper=The News International, April 2013|date=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program was launched in April 2013 by Pakistan Information Security Association and the program as expanded to country's universities.

== China, United States and others ==
Within cyberwarfare, the individual must recognize the state actors involved in committing these cyber-attacks against one another. The two predominant players that will be discussed is the age-old [[East–West dichotomy|comparison of East versus West]], China's cyber capabilities compared to United States' capabilities. There are many other state and non-state actors involved in cyberwarfare, such as Russia, Iran, Iraq, and Al Qaeda; since China and the U.S. are leading the foreground in cyberwarfare capabilities, they will be the only two state actors discussed.

But in Q2 2013, [[Akamai Technologies]] reported that Indonesia toppled China with portion 38 percent of cyber attack, a high increase from 21 percent portion in previous quarter. China set 33 percent and US set at 6.9 percent. 79 percent of attack came from Asia Pacific region. Indonesia dominated the attacking to ports 80 and 443 by about 90 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2425836,00.asp |title=Indonesia Tops China as Cyber Attack Capital |date=October 16, 2013 | work=PC Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
{{Main|Cyberwarfare in China}}
{{more citations needed|section, except for one footnote, | date= July 2013}}
China's [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) has developed a strategy called "Integrated Network Electronic Warfare" which guides computer network operations and [[cyberwarfare]] tools. This strategy helps link together network warfare tools and electronic warfare weapons against an opponent's information systems during conflict. They believe the fundamentals for achieving success is about seizing control of an opponent's information flow and establishing information dominance.&lt;ref name="krekel" /&gt; ''The Science of Military'' and ''The Science of Campaigns'' both identify enemy logistics systems networks as the highest priority for cyber-attacks and states that cyberwarfare must mark the start if a campaign, used properly, can enable overall operational success.&lt;ref name=krekel&gt;Krekel, Bryan. People's Republic of China. The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission.Capability of the People's Republic of China to Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation . Virginia: Northrop Grumman, 2009. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Focusing on attacking the opponent's infrastructure to disrupt transmissions and processes of information that dictate decision-making operations, the PLA would secure cyber dominance over their adversary. The predominant techniques that would be utilized during a conflict to gain the upper hand are as follows, the PLA would strike with electronic jammers, electronic deception and suppression techniques to interrupt the transfer processes of information. They would launch virus attacks or hacking techniques to sabotage information processes, all in the hopes of destroying enemy information platforms and facilities. The PLA's ''Science of Campaigns'' noted that one role for cyberwarfare is to create windows of opportunity for other forces to operate without detection or with a lowered risk of counterattack by exploiting the enemy's periods of "blindness", "deafness" or "paralysis" created by cyber-attacks.&lt;ref name=krekel /&gt; That is one of the main focal points of cyberwarefare, to be able to weaken your enemy to the full extent possible so that your physical offensive will have a higher percentage of success.

The PLA conduct regular training exercises in a variety of environments emphasizing the use of cyberwarfare tactics and techniques in countering such tactics if it is employed against them.  Faculty research has been focusing on designs for rootkit usage and detection for their Kylin Operating System which helps to further train these individuals' cyberwarfare techniques. China perceives cyberwarfare as a deterrent to nuclear weapons, possessing the ability for greater precision, leaving fewer casualties, and allowing for long ranged attacks.

=== United States ===
{{See also|Office of Personnel Management data breach|Vault 7}}
In the West, the [[United States]] provides a different "tone of voice" when cyberwarfare is on the tip of everyone's tongue. The United States provides security plans strictly in the response to cyberwarfare, basically going on the defensive when they are being attacked by devious cyber methods. In the U.S., the responsibility of cybersecurity is divided between the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Defense. In recent years, a new department was created to specifically tend to cyber threats, this department is known as Cyber Command. Cyber Command is a military subcommand under US Strategic Command and is responsible for dealing with threats to the military cyber infrastructure. Cyber Command's service elements include Army Forces Cyber Command, the Twenty-fourth Air Force, Fleet Cyber Command and Marine Forces Cyber Command.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James, and Katrina Timlin. United States. Center for Strategic and International Studies. Cybersecurity and Cyberwarfare: Preliminary Assessment of National Doctrine and Organization. Washington, D.C.: , 2011. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; It ensures that the President can navigate and control information systems and that he also has military options available when defense of the nation needs to be enacted in cyberspace. Individuals at Cyber Command must pay attention to state and non-state actors who are developing cyberwarfare capabilities in conducting cyber espionage and other cyber-attacks against the nation and its allies. Cyber Command seeks to be a deterrence factor to dissuade potential adversaries from attacking the U.S., while being a multi-faceted department in conducting cyber operations of its own.

Three prominent events took place which may have been catalysts in the creation of the idea of Cyber Command. There was a failure of critical infrastructure reported by the CIA where malicious activities against information technology systems disrupted electrical power capabilities overseas. This resulted in multi-city power outages across multiple regions. The second event was the exploitation of global financial services. In November 2008, an international bank had a compromised payment processor that allowed fraudulent transactions to be made at more than 130 automated teller machines in 49 cities within a 30-minute period.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Review Team of Government Cybersecurity Experts. Cyberspace Policy Review: Assuring a Trusted and Resilient Information and Communications Infrastructure. Washington, D.C.: , Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The last event was the systemic loss of U.S. economic value when an industry in 2008 estimated $1 trillion in losses of intellectual property to data theft. Even though all these events were internal catastrophes, they were very real in nature, meaning nothing can stop state or non-state actors to do the same thing on an even grander scale. Other initiatives like the Cyber Training Advisory Council were created to improve the quality, efficiency, and sufficiency of training for computer network defense, attack, and exploitation of enemy cyber operations.

On both ends of the spectrum, East and West nations show a "sword and shield" contrast in ideals. The Chinese have a more offensive minded idea for cyberwarfare, trying to get the pre-emptive strike in the early stages of conflict to gain the upper-hand. In the U.S. there are more reactionary measures being taken at creating systems with impenetrable barriers to protect the nation and its civilians from cyber-attacks.

According to ''Homeland Preparedness News'', many mid-sized U.S. companies have a difficult time defending their systems against cyber attacks. Around 80 percent of assets vulnerable to a cyber attack are owned by private companies and organizations. Former New York State Deputy Secretary for Public Safety Michael Balboni said that private entities "do not have the type of capability, bandwidth, interest or experience to develop a proactive cyber analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/countermeasures/18834-expert-work-needed-get-private-sector-cyber-secure/|title=Expert: More work needed to get private sector cyber secure|last=Rozens|first=Tracy|date=2016-05-19|website=Homeland Preparedness News|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to cyber-attacks on April 1, 2015, President Obama issued an Executive Order establishing the first-ever economic sanctions. The Executive Order will impact individuals and entities ("designees") responsible for cyber-attacks that threaten the national security, foreign policy, economic health, or financial stability of the US. Specifically, the Executive Order authorizes the Treasury Department to freeze designees' assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/sanctions-cyber-crime.pdf |title= Sanctions: U.S. action on cyber crime |publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, April, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ted Koppel]]'s book, in 2008, the United States in collaboration with Israel, ran a cyberattack on Iran's nuclear program, becoming "the first to use a digital weapon as an instrument of policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/910424314|title=Lights out : a cyberattack, a nation unprepared, surviving the aftermath|last=8-|first=Koppel, Ted, 1940 February|isbn=9780553419962|edition= First |location=New York|oclc=910424314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ukraine ===
{{Main|2017 cyberattacks on Ukraine}}
A series of powerful cyber attacks began 27 June 2017 that swamped websites of Ukrainian organizations, including banks, ministries, newspapers and electricity firms.

=== Russia ===
During [[2018 FIFA World Cup|FIFA world cup 2018]], Russia countered and stopped around 25 million cyber attacks on IT Infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rt.com/news/433300-russia-world-cup-cyber-attacks/|title=Russia blocked 25mn cyber attacks on IT infrastructure during World Cup – Putin|work=RT International|access-date=2018-07-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequence of a potential attack ==
A whole industry is working trying to minimize the likelihood and the consequence of an information attack.

For a partial list see: [[:Category:Computer security software companies|Computer security software companies]].

They offer different products and services, aimed at:

* study all possible attacks category
* publish books and articles about the subject
* discovering vulnerabilities
* evaluating the risks
* fixing vulnerabilities
* invent, design and deploy countermeasures
* set up [[contingency plan]] in order to be ready to respond

Many organizations are trying to classify vulnerability and their consequence: the most famous vulnerability database is the [[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures]].

[[Computer emergency response team]]s are set up by government and large organization to handle computer security incidents.

== Infrastructures as targets ==
Once a cyber-attack has been initiated, there are certain targets that need to be attacked to cripple the opponent. Certain infrastructures as targets have been highlighted as critical infrastructures in time of conflict that can severely cripple a nation. Control systems, energy resources, finance, telecommunications, transportation, and water facilities are seen as critical infrastructure targets during conflict. A new report on the industrial cybersecurity problems, produced by the British Columbia Institute of Technology, and the PA Consulting Group, using data from as far back as 1981, reportedly{{weasel inline|date=May 2013}} has found a 10-fold increase in the number of successful cyber-attacks on infrastructure Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems since 2000.&lt;ref name=linden /&gt; Cyberattacks that have an adverse physical effect are known as cyber-physical attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Loukas|first1=George|date = June 2015|title=Cyber-Physical Attacks A growing invisible threat|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2818550|location=Oxford, UK|publisher=Butterworh-Heinemann (Elsevier)|page = 65 |isbn= 9780128012901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Control systems ===
Control systems are responsible for activating and monitoring industrial or mechanical controls. Many devices are integrated with computer platforms to control valves and gates to certain physical infrastructures. Control systems are usually designed as remote telemetry devices that link to other physical devices through internet access or modems. Little security can be offered when dealing with these devices, enabling many hackers or cyberterrorists to seek out systematic vulnerabilities. Paul Blomgren, manager of sales engineering at cybersecurity firm explained how his people drove to a remote substation, saw a wireless network antenna and immediately plugged in their wireless LAN cards. They took out their laptops and connected to the system because it wasn't using passwords. "Within 10 minutes, they had mapped every piece of equipment in the facility," Blomgren said. "Within 15 minutes, they mapped every piece of equipment in the operational control network. Within 20 minutes, they were talking to the business network and had pulled off several business reports. They never even left the vehicle."&lt;ref name=lyons&gt;Lyons, Marty. United States. Homeland Security. Threat Assessment of Cyber Warfare. Washington, D.C.: , 2005. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy ===
Energy is seen as the second infrastructure that could be attacked. It is broken down into two categories, electricity and natural gas. '''Electricity''' also known as electric grids power cities, regions, and households; it powers machines and other mechanisms used in day-to-day life. Using U.S. as an example, in a conflict cyberterrorists can access data through the Daily Report of System Status that shows power flows throughout the system and can pinpoint the busiest sections of the grid. By shutting those grids down, they can cause mass hysteria, backlog, and confusion; also being able to locate critical areas of operation to further attacks in a more direct method. Cyberterrorists can access instructions on how to connect to the Bonneville Power Administration which helps direct them on how to not fault the system in the process. This is a major advantage that can be utilized when cyber-attacks are being made because foreign attackers with no prior knowledge of the system can attack with the highest accuracy without drawbacks. Cyberattacks on '''natural gas''' installations go much the same way as it would with attacks on electrical grids. Cyberterrorists can shutdown these installations stopping the flow or they can even reroute gas flows to another section that can be occupied by one of their allies. There was a case in Russia with a gas supplier known as Gazprom, they lost control of their central switchboard which routes gas flow, after an inside operator and Trojan horse program bypassed security.&lt;ref name=lyons /&gt;

=== Finance ===
Financial infrastructures could be hit hard by cyber-attacks as the financial system is linked by computer systems.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt; is constant money being exchanged in these institutions and if cyberterrorists were to attack and if transactions were rerouted and large amounts of money stolen, financial industries would collapse and civilians would be without jobs and security. Operations would stall from region to region causing nationwide economical degradation. In the U.S. alone, the average daily volume of transactions hit $3 trillion and 99% of it is non-cash flow.&lt;ref name=lyons /&gt; To be able to disrupt that amount of money for one day or for a period of days can cause lasting damage making investors pull out of funding and erode public confidence.

A cyberattack on a financial institution or transactions may be referred to as a '''cyberheist'''. These attacks may start with phishing that targets employees, using [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]] to coax information from them. They may allow attackers to [[Hacker (computer security)|hack]] into the network and put [[Keystroke logging|keylogger]]s on the [[Accounting information system|accounting systems]]. In time, the cybercriminals are able to obtain password and keys information. An organization's bank accounts can then be accessed via the information they have stolen using the keyloggers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krebs |first=Brian |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/10/avoid_windows_malware_bank_on.html |title=Security Fix - Avoid Windows Malware: Bank on a Live CD |publisher=Voices.washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, a gang carried out a US$40 million cyberheist from the [[Bank of Muscat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlinenewsoman.com/2013/05/17/indian-companies-at-center-of-global-cyber-heist/|title=Indian Companies at Center of Global Cyber Heist|website=onlinenewsoman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telecommunications ===
Cyberattacking telecommunication infrastructures have straightforward results. Telecommunication integration is becoming common practice, systems such as voice and IP networks are merging. Everything is being run through the internet because the speeds and storage capabilities are endless. Denial-of-service attacks can be administered as previously mentioned, but more complex attacks can be made on BGP routing protocols or DNS infrastructures. It is less likely that an attack would target or compromise the traditional telephony network of SS7 switches, or an attempted attack on physical devices such as microwave stations or satellite facilities. The ability would still be there to shut down those physical facilities to disrupt telephony networks. The whole idea on these cyber-attacks is to cut people off from one another, to disrupt communication, and by doing so, to impede critical information being sent and received. In cyberwarfare, this is a critical way of gaining the upper-hand in a conflict. By controlling the flow of information and communication, a nation can plan more accurate strikes and enact better counter-attack measures on their enemies.

=== Transportation ===
Transportation infrastructure mirrors telecommunication facilities; by impeding transportation for individuals in a city or region, the economy will slightly degrade over time. Successful cyber-attacks can impact scheduling and accessibility, creating a disruption in the economic chain. Carrying methods will be impacted, making it hard for cargo to be sent from one place to another. In January 2003 during the "slammer" virus, Continental Airlines was forced to shut down flights due to computer problems.&lt;ref name=lyons /&gt; Cyberterrorists can target railroads by disrupting switches, target flight software to impede airplanes, and target road usage to impede more conventional transportation methods. In May 2015, a man, Chris Roberts, who was a cyberconsultant, revealed to the FBI that he had repeatedly, from 2011 to 2014, managed to hack into Boeing and Airbus flights' controls via the onboard entertainment system, allegedly, and had at least once ordered a flight to climb. The FBI, after detaining him in April 2015 in Syracuse, had interviewed him about the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/17/us/fbi-hacker-flight-computer-systems/index.html|title=FBI: Hacker claimed to have taken over flight's engine controls|work=CNN|date=May 18, 2015|author=Evan Perez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water ===
Water as an infrastructure could be one of the most critical infrastructures to be attacked. It is seen as one of the greatest security hazards among all of the computer-controlled systems. There is the potential to have massive amounts of water unleashed into an area which could be unprotected causing loss of life and property damage. It is not even water supplies that could be attacked; sewer systems can be compromised too. There was no calculation given to the cost of damages, but the estimated cost to replace critical water systems could be in the hundreds of billions of dollars.&lt;ref name=lyons /&gt; Most of these water infrastructures are well developed making it hard for cyber-attacks to cause any significant damage, at most, equipment failure can occur causing power outlets to be disrupted for a short time.

Before the fertilized [[ovum]] reaches the [[uterus]], the [[mucous membrane]] of the body of the uterus undergoes important changes and is then known as the [[decidua]]. The thickness and vascularity of the mucous membrane are greatly increased; its glands are elongated and open on its free surface by funnel-shaped [[orifices]], while their deeper portions are tortuous and dilated into irregular spaces. The interglandular tissue is also increased in quantity, and is crowded with large round, oval, or polygonal cells, termed '''decidual cells'''.  Their enlargement is due to glycogen and lipid accumulation in the cytoplasm allowing these cells to provide a rich source of nutrition for the developing embryo.

Experimentally, human endometrial stromal cells can be decidualized in culture by using analogs of [[Cyclic AMP|cAMP]] and [[progesterone]]. The cells will exhibit a decidualized phenotype and display upregulation of common [[decidualization]] markers such as [[prolactin]] and [[IGFBP1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gellersen|first=Birgit|last2=Brosens|first2=Ivo|last3=Brosens|first3=Jan|date=2007-11-01|title=Decidualization of the Human Endometrium: Mechanisms, Functions, and Clinical Perspectives|url=http://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-2007-991042|journal=Seminars in Reproductive Medicine|language=en|volume=25|issue=6|pages=445–453|doi=10.1055/s-2007-991042|issn=1526-8004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12618">'''Elder financial abuse''' is a type of [[elder abuse]] in which misappropriation of financial resources or abusive use of [[Economic abuse|financial control]], in the context of a relationship where there is an expectation of trust, causes harm to an older person.

The Older Americans Act of 2006 defines elder financial abuse, or financial exploitation, as “the [[fraud]]ulent or otherwise illegal, unauthorized, or improper act or process of an individual, including a caregiver or [[fiduciary]], that uses the resources of an older individual for monetary or personal benefit, profit, or gain, or that results in depriving an older individual of rightful access to, or use of, benefits, resources, belongings, or assets.”&lt;ref&gt;Older Americans Act of 2006, [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:42%20section:1397j%20edition:prelim], retrieved July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===By family or caregivers===

Family members and informal or paid caregivers have special access to seniors and thus are often in a position to inflict financial abuse through [[deception]], [[coercion]], misrepresentation, undue influence, or theft. Common abusive practices include:
* Money or property is used without the senior's permission or taken from them, for example removal from their home and then use of the home by the abuser, or depositing income such as pension or benefit checks
* The senior's signature is forged or [[identity theft|identity is misappropriated]] for financial transactions
* The senior is coerced or influenced to sign over deeds or [[will (law)|wills]], or caused to execute legal documents they do not understand
* The abuser fraudulently obtains a [[power of attorney]] or [[guardianship]]
* Money is borrowed from the senior and never repaid

Family members engaged in financial abuse of the elderly may include spouses, children, or grandchildren. They may engage in the activity because they feel justified, for instance, they are taking what they might later inherit or have a sense of "entitlement" due to a negative personal relationship with the older person, or that it is somehow the price of a promise of lifelong care. Or they may take money or property to prevent other family members from getting the money or for fear that their inheritance may be lost due to cost of treating illnesses. Sometimes, family members take money or property from their elders because of gambling or other financial problems or [[substance abuse]]. (source?)

===Scams and fraud targeting seniors===

Seniors are also often deliberately targeted by scams, fraud, and misleading marketing – often by otherwise legitimate businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Shilling, D. (2008, November/December). "Improving the court system's response to elder abuse," Victimization of the Elderly and Disabled, 11, 49, 51-52, 59, 62-63.&lt;/ref&gt; This may include:
* fraudulent investment or insurance schemes
* fraudulent contracts and unauthorized charges imposed by internet service providers
* worthless "sweepstakes" that elderly persons must pay in order to collect winnings
* fake pharmaceutical or diet/health products
* medical billing scams and unnecessary medical care
* predatory or unnecessary lending, for example reverse mortgages
* charitable giving scams, including pressure to rewrite wills
* [[identity theft]]
* [[lottery scam]]s
* [[Work-at-home scheme|work from home schemes]] or other ways to generate income

A 1996 study by [[AARP]]&lt;ref&gt;AARP. (1996). Telemarketing fraud victimization of older Americans: an AARP survey. Washington, DC: AARP.&lt;/ref&gt; found that while individuals over 50 comprised 35% of the American population, they accounted for 57% of all fraud victims (AARP, 1996). Seniors' level of vulnerability to this type of exploitation varies by the type of scam. For example, the AARP found that lottery fraud victims were more likely to be women over 70 living alone, with lower education, lower income, and less financial literacy, while victims of investment fraud were more likely to be men between the ages of 55 and 62 who were married, with higher incomes and greater financial literacy.
&lt;ref&gt;“Off the Hook: Reducing Participation in Telemarketing Fraud (Washington, DC: 2003), [http://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/consume/d17812_fraud.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid financial exploitation===

Hybrid Financial Exploitation (HFE) is financial exploitation that co-occurs with [[physical abuse]] and/or [[neglect]]. HFE victims are more likely to be co-habiting with abusive individual, to have fair/poor health, to fear the abusive individual, to perceive abusive individual as caretaker, and to have a longer duration of abuse.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jackson S, Hafemeister T | year = 2012 | title = Pure financial exploitation vs. Hybrid financial exploitation co-occurring with physical abuse and/or neglect of elderly persons | url = | journal = Psychology Of Violence | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 285–296 | doi=10.1037/a0027273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Estimates of size and scope==

Various attempts have been made to estimate the size and scope of the problem. The primary difficulties in estimating the size of the problem are:
* ''Differing descriptions of financial abuse'' – Victims often do not identify as having been a victim of fraud, so researchers generally offer respondents specific examples. The more specific the questions are, the more likely someone is to say they have experienced it – for example, surveys focused on [[identity theft]], [[telemarketing]], "[[Credit card fraud#Unexpected repeat billing|gray charges]]," or [[Securities fraud|investor fraud]] have found much higher rates than general surveys.
* ''Underreporting'' – Studies that rely on government databases or press reports are estimated to be off by factors ranging from five to forty, with 25 being a frequently cited number.&lt;ref&gt;Wasik, J. (2000). The fleecing of America’s elderly. Consumers Digest. March/April.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, because of the [[Social stigma#Current research|stigma]] of victimhood caregivers are more likely to report that their parents have been victimized than the parents are to self-report as victims.
* ''Differences in survey methodology'' – Some surveys ask for losses in the last year, some ask about losses in the last five years, and some ask "have you ever experienced…", and surveys have variously defined seniors as aged 45+, 50+, 60+, and 65+.

| $36 billion in annual losses
| The study found that 37% of seniors affected over any given five-year period, consistent with 15% annual victimization rates found elsewhere. They do not provide a loss per incident but found any given victim loses approximately $11,600 over five years.

| Their estimate is based on an estimated 1,256 incidents of financial abuse reported in the press, out of approximately 40 million seniors. The report acknowledges that making an estimate based only on press reports will produce an underestimate by a factor of five to forty. The study also found that about one third of incidents were by family and friends, with the remainder by strangers or businesses.

'''Evolutionary dynamics''' is the study of the [[Mathematics|mathematical principles]] according to which biological organisms as well as cultural ideas evolve and [[Evolution|evolved]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YXrIRDuAbE0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Evolutionary dynamics: exploring the equations of life By Martin A. Nowak]&lt;/ref&gt; This is mostly achieved through the mathematical discipline of [[population genetics]], along with evolutionary game theory. Most population genetics considers changes in the frequencies of [[allele]]s at a small number of [[gene]] [[locus (genetics)|loci]]. When [[infinitesimal]] effects at a large number of gene loci are considered, one derives [[quantitative genetics]]. Traditional population genetic models deal with alleles and genotypes, and are frequently [[stochastic]]. In [[evolutionary game theory]], developed first by [[John Maynard Smith]], evolutionary biology concepts may take a [[deterministic]] mathematical form, with selection acting directly on inherited phenotypes. These same models can be applied to studying the evolution of human preferences and ideologies. Many variants on these models have been developed, which incorporate [[weak selection]], mutual population structure, stochasticity, etc. These models have relevance also to the generation and maintenance of tissues in mammals, since an  understanding of tissue cell kinetics, architecture, and development from adult stem cells has important implications for aging and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tannenbaum | first1 = Emmanuel | last2 = Sherley | first2 = James L | last3 = Shakhnovich | first3 = Eugene I | year = 2005 | title = Evolutionary dynamics of adult stem cells: comparison of random and immortal-strand segregation mechanisms | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevE.71.041914 | journal = Physical Review E | volume = 71 | issue = | page = 041914 | arxiv = q-bio/0411048 | bibcode = 2005PhRvE..71d1914T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the type of media content}}
'''Fiction''' broadly refers to any [[narrative]] that is derived from the [[imagination]]—in other words, not based strictly on history or fact.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fiction fiction]." Merriam-Webster, Incorporated. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sageng, Fossheim, &amp; Larsen (eds.) (2012). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=q_AVJXKbE4wC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=events+places The Philosophy of Computer Games]''. Springer Science &amp; Business Media. pp. 186–87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C.

New York: Prentice Hall, 1990, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also refer, more narrowly, to narratives written only in prose (the [[novel]] and [[short story]]), and is often used as a synonym for the novel.&lt;ref&gt;M. h. Abrams, ''A Glossary of Literary Terms'' (7th edition), Fort Worth: Harcourt Brace, 1999, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In its most narrow usage fiction refers to novels, but it may also denote any "[[literature|literary]] narrative" (see [[literary fiction]]),&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, ''A Glossary of Literary Terms'' (7th edition). Fort Worth, TX: Harcourt Brace, 1999, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/fiction Definition of 'fiction']." ''Oxford English Dictionaries'' (online). Oxford University Press. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[novel]]s, [[novella]]s, and [[short story|short stories]]. More broadly, fiction has come to encompass imaginative storytelling in any format, including [[writing]]s, [[drama|theatrical performances]], [[comics]], [[film]]s, [[television program]]s, [[animation]]s, games (most notably, [[video game]]s and [[role-playing game]]s), and so on.

A work of fiction implies the inventive act of [[worldbuilding|constructing an imaginary world]], so its audience does not typically expect it to be totally faithful to the real world in presenting only [[character (arts)|characters]] who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true.&lt;ref name="litfiction"&gt;{{cite book|last=Farner|first=Geir|year=2014|title=Literary Fiction: The Ways We Read Narrative Literature|chapter=Chapter 2: What is Literary Fiction?|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qXXHAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the context of fiction, generally understood as not adhering precisely to the real world, is more open to interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=31|last=Culler|first=Jonathan|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction|quote=Non-fictional discourse is usually embedded in a context that tells you how to take it: an instruction manual, a newspaper report, a letter from a charity. The context of fiction, though, explicitly leaves open the question of what the fiction is really about. Reference to the world is not so much a property of literary [i.e. fictional] works as a function they are given by interpretation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters and events within a fictional work may even be set in their own context entirely separate from the known universe: an independent [[fictional universe]].

Fiction's traditional opposite is [[non-fiction]], a narrative work whose creator assumes responsibility for presenting only the historical and factual truth. The distinction between fiction and non-fiction however can be unclear in some recent artistic and literary movements, such as [[postmodern literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Iftekharuddin, Frahat (ed.). (2003). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=61w4hxtXnFUC&amp;dq The Postmodern Short Story: Forms and Issues]''. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, fiction includes [[novel]]s, [[short story|short stories]], [[fables]], [[legend]]s, [[myths]], [[fairy tales]], [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[narrative poetry]], [[Play (theatre)|plays]] (including [[operas]], [[musical theatre|musicals]], [[drama]]s, [[puppet play]]s, and [[concert dance|various kinds of theatrical dances]]). However, fiction may also encompass [[comic book]]s, and many [[animated cartoon]]s, [[stop motion]]s, [[anime]], [[manga]], [[fictional film|films]], [[video games]], [[radio drama|radio programs]], [[television program]]s ([[television comedy|comedies]] and [[dramatic programming|dramas]]), etc.

The [[Internet]] has had a major impact on the creation and distribution of fiction, calling into question the feasibility of [[copyright]] as a means to ensure [[royalties]] are paid to copyright holders.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Oliver. (2015). "[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/09/why-it-is-crucial-that-the-publishing-industry-embrace-fan-fiction.html Why Fan Fiction is the Future of Publishing]."
''The Daily Beast''. The Daily Beast Company LLC.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[digital libraries]] such as [[Project Gutenberg]] make [[public domain]] texts more readily available. The combination of inexpensive home computers, the Internet and the creativity of its users has also led to new forms of fiction, such as interactive [[computer game]]s or computer-generated comics. Countless forums for [[fan fiction]] can be found online, where loyal followers of specific [[fictional realm]]s create and distribute derivative stories. The Internet is also used for the development of [[blog fiction]], where a story is delivered through a [[blog]] either as flash fiction or serial [[blog]], and [[collaborative fiction]], where a story is written sequentially by different authors, or the entire text can be revised by anyone using a [[wiki]].

Types of [[literary fiction]] in [[prose]] include:&lt;ref&gt;Milhorn, H. Thomas. (2006). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1AM825Ny4v0C&amp;pg Writing Genre Fiction: A Guide to the Craft]''. Universal Publishers: Boca Raton. pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Short story]]: A work of at least 2,000 words but under 7,500 words. The boundary between a long short story and a novella is vague.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms'' (1992). London: Penguin Books, 1999, p. 600.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Novella]]: A work of at least 7,500 words but under 50,000 words. [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899) is an example of a [[novella]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://global.britannica.com/topic/Heart-of-Darkness Heart of Darkness Novella by Conrad] – ''Encyclopædia Britannica'',&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Novel]]: A work of 50,000 words or more.

== Genre fiction ==
{{main|Genre fiction}}

Fiction is commonly broken down into a variety of [[list of fictional genres|genres]]: subsets of fiction, each differentiated by a particular unifying [[Tone (literature)|tone or style]], [[literary technique#literary techniques|narrative technique]], [[content (media)|media content]], or popularly defined criterion. [[Science fiction]], for example, predicts or supposes technologies that are not realities at the time of the work's creation: [[Jules Verne]]'s novel ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'' was published in 1865 and only in 1969 did astronaut [[Neil Armstrong]] first land on the moon.

[[Historical fiction]] places imaginary characters into real historical events. In the early historical novel ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'', [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s fictional character Edward Waverley meets a figure from history, [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]], and takes part in the [[Battle of Prestonpans]]. Some works of fiction are slightly or greatly re-imagined based on some originally true story, or a reconstructed biography.&lt;ref name="The Role of Narrative Fiction and Semi-Fiction in Organizational Studies"/&gt; Often, even when the fictional story is based on fact, there may be additions and subtractions from the true story to make it more interesting. An example is Tim O'Brien's ''[[The Things They Carried]]'', a series of [[short stories]] about the [[Vietnam War]].

Fictional works that explicitly involve supernatural, magical, or scientifically impossible elements are often classified under the genre of [[fantasy]], including [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice In Wonderland]]'', [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Creators of fantasy sometimes introduce imaginary creatures and beings such as dragons and fairies.&lt;ref name="C. Hugh Holman 1990, p. 212"/&gt;

==Literary fiction==
{{main|Literature|Literary fiction}}

[[Literary fiction]] is a term used in the book-trade to distinguish novels that are regarded as having [[literary merit]], from most commercial or [[genre fiction|"genre" fiction]].

[[Neal Stephenson]] has suggested that while any definition will be simplistic there is today a general cultural difference between literary and genre fiction. On the one hand literary authors nowadays are frequently supported by patronage, with employment at a university or a similar institution, and with the continuation of such positions determined not by book sales but by critical acclaim by other established literary authors and critics. On the other hand, he suggests, genre fiction writers tend to support themselves by book sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slashdot.org/story/04/10/20/1518217/neal-stephenson-responds-with-wit-and-humor ''Slashdot Interview'' from 20 October 2004 with Neal Stephenson]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in an interview, [[John Updike]] lamented that "the category of 'literary fiction' has sprung up recently to torment people like me who just set out to write books, and if anybody wanted to read them, terrific, the more the merrier. ... I'm a genre writer of a sort. I write literary fiction, which is like spy fiction or chick lit".{{sfn|Grossman|2006}} Likewise, on ''[[The Charlie Rose Show]]'', he argued that this term, when applied to his work, greatly limited him and his expectations of what might come of his writing, so he does not really like it. He suggested that all his works are literary, simply because "they are written in words".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/356 ''The Charlie Rose Show'' from 14 June 2006 with John Updike] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203054558/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/356 |date=3 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary fiction often involves [[social commentary]], [[political criticism]], or reflection on the [[human condition]].{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=180}} In general it focuses on "introspective, in-depth character studies" of "interesting, complex and developed" characters.{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=180}}{{sfn|Coles|2009|p=7}} This contrasts with genre fiction where plot is the central concern.{{sfn|Saricks|2009|pp=181–82}} Usually in literary fiction the focus is on the "inner story" of the characters who drive the plot, with detailed motivations to elicit "emotional involvement" in the reader.{{sfn|Coles|2007|p=26}}{{sfn|Coles|2009|p=8}} The [[Style (fiction)|style]] of literary fiction is often described as "elegantly written, lyrical, and ... layered".{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=179}} The [[Tone (literature)|tone]] of literary fiction can be darker than genre fiction,{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=182}} while the pacing of literary fiction may be slower than popular fiction.{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=182}} As [[Terrence Rafferty]] notes, "literary fiction, by its nature, allows itself to dawdle, to linger on stray beauties even at the risk of losing its way".{{sfn|Rafferty|2011}}

== Realism{{anchor|Reality_and_fiction}} ==
{{See also|Literary realism}}

Realistic fiction typically involves a story whose basic [[setting (narrative)|setting]] (time and location in the world) is real and whose events could feasibly happen in a real-world setting; non-realistic fiction involves a story where the opposite is the case, often being set in an entirely [[wikt:alternate universe|imaginary universe]], an [[alternative history]] of the world other than that currently understood as true, or some other non-existent location or time-period, sometimes even presenting [[impossible technology]] or a defiance of the currently understood laws of nature. However, all types of fiction arguably invite their audience to explore real ideas, issues, or possibilities in an otherwise imaginary setting, or using what is understood about reality to mentally construct something similar to reality, though still distinct from it.{{refn|group=note|As philosopher Stacie Friend explains, "in reading we take works of fiction, like works of non-fiction, to be about the real world—even if they invite us to imagine the world to be different from how it actually is. [Thus], imagining a storyworld does not mean directing one's imagining toward something other than the real world; it is instead a mental activity that involves constructing a complex representation of what a story portrays".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Friend |first=Stacie |year=2017 |title=The Real Foundation of Fictional Worlds |url=http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/13997/1/13997.pdf |journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy |volume=95 |pages=29–42 |doi=10.1080/00048402.2016.1149736}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=note|The research of Weisberg and Goodstein (2009) revealed that, despite not being specifically informed that, say, the fictional character Sherlock Holmes, had two legs, their subjects "consistently assumed that some real-world facts obtained in fiction, although they were sensitive to the kind of fact and the realism of the story."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Deena_Weisberg/publication/233656603_What_Belongs_in_a_Fictional_World/links/54aadcd90cf2ce2df668ca52.pdf Weisberg, D.S. &amp; Goodstein, J., "What Belongs in a Fictional World?", ''Journal of Cognition and Culture'', Vol. 9, No. 1, (March 2009), pp. 69–78.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In terms of the traditional separation between fiction and [[non-fiction]], the lines are now commonly understood as blurred, showing more overlap than mutual exclusion. Even fiction usually has elements of, or grounding in, truth. The distinction between the two may be best defined from the perspective of the audience, according to whom a work is regarded as non-fiction if its people, places, and events are all historically or factually real, while a work is regarded as fiction if it deviates from reality in any of those areas. The distinction between fiction and non-fiction is further obscured by an understanding, on the one hand, that the truth can be presented through imaginary channels and constructions, while, on the other hand, imagination can just as well bring about significant conclusions about truth and reality.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Literary critic [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]], argues that "fiction is both artifice and [[verisimilitude (narrative)|verisimilitude]]", meaning that it requires both creative invention as well as some acceptable degree of believability,&lt;ref&gt;Wood, James. 2008. ''How Fiction Works.'' New York. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; a notion often encapsulated in poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s term: [[willing suspension of disbelief]]. Also, infinite fictional possibilities themselves signal the impossibility of fully knowing reality, provocatively demonstrating that there is no criterion to measure constructs of reality.&lt;ref name="subversive"/&gt;

'''Floral symmetry''' describes whether, and how, a [[flower]], in particular its [[perianth]], can be divided into two or more identical or mirror-image parts.

Uncommonly, flowers may have no axis of [[symmetry]] at all, typically because their parts are spirally arranged.

== Actinomorphic ==
{{further|Merosity}}
[[File:Wurmbea stricta 0153.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Wurmbea]] stricta'', its [[tepal]]s in actinomorphic arrangement]]

Most flowers are '''actinomorphic''' ("star shaped", "radial"), meaning they can be divided into 3 or more identical sectors which are related to each other by rotation about the centre of the flower. Typically, each sector might contain one [[tepal]] or one petal and one sepal and so on. It may or may not be possible to divide the flower into symmetrical halves by the same number of longitudinal planes passing through the axis: [[Oleander]] is an example of a flower without such mirror planes. Actinomorphic flowers are also called [[symmetry (biology)#Radial symmetry|radially symmetrical]] or regular flowers. Other examples of actinomorphic flowers are the [[lily]] (''[[Lilium]]'', [[Liliaceae]]) and the [[buttercup]] (''[[Ranunculus]]'', [[Ranunculaceae]]).

== Zygomorphic ==
[[File:Satyrium erectum detail Ground orchid Pienktrewwa Near Ceres, Western Cape 0414.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Satyrium carneum]]''. Ground orchid with typical zygomorphic floral anatomy]]

'''Zygomorphic''' ("[[wikt:yoke|yoke]] shaped", "bilateral" – from the Greek ζυγόν, ''zygon'', yoke, and μορφή, ''morphe'', shape) flowers can be divided by only a single plane into two mirror-image halves, much like a yoke or a person's face. Examples are [[orchid]]s and the flowers of most members of the [[Lamiales]] (e.g., [[Scrophulariaceae]] and [[Gesneriaceae]]). Some authors prefer the term monosymmetry or bilateral symmetry.{{sfn|Craene|2010|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=24p-LgWPA50C&amp;pg=PA25 p.&amp;nbsp;25]}}

== Asymmetry ==
A few plant species have flowers lacking any symmetry, and therefore having a "handedness". Examples: [[Valerian (herb)|''Valeriana officinalis'']] and ''[[Canna indica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weberling|first1=Focko|title=Morphology of Flowers and Inflorescences|date=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0 521 25134 6|page=19|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-ZlOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=valerian+flower+symmetry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=whYatdGdPT&amp;sig=Zkar4siWlOc-6UfAx7I0aCX9_5Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sT2UVNGyKpOMaO6TgLgI&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=valerian%20flower%20symmetry&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences ==
Actinomorphic flowers are a basal angiosperm character; zygomorphic flowers are a derived character that has evolved many times.&lt;ref name=Bio8&gt;{{cite book |author1=Losos, J.B. |author2=Mason, K.A |author3=Singer, S.R. |title=Biology |publisher=McGraw Hill |location=New York |edition=8th }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some familiar and seemingly actinomorphic so-called flowers, such as those of [[Bellis perennis|daisies]] and [[dandelions]] ([[Asteraceae]]), and most species of ''[[Protea]]'', are actually clusters of tiny (not necessarily actinomorphic) flowers arranged into a roughly radially symmetric [[inflorescence]] of the form known as a [[Pseudanthium|head, capitulum, or pseudanthium]].

== Peloria ==

{{main|Pelorism}}

[[Image:PeloricFoxglove.jpg|thumb|upright| ''[[Digitalis purpurea]]'' (common foxglove) displaying an aberrant peloric terminal flower and normal zygomorphic flowers]]

Peloria or a peloric flower is the aberration in which a plant that normally produces zygomorphic flowers produces actinomorphic flowers instead. This aberration can be developmental, or it can have a genetic basis:  the CYCLOIDEA gene controls floral symmetry. Peloric ''[[Antirrhinum]]'' plants have been produced by knocking out this gene.&lt;ref name=Bio8/&gt; Many modern cultivars of ''[[Sinningia speciosa]]'' ("gloxinia") have been bred to have peloric flowers as they are larger and showier than the normally zygomorphic flowers of this species.

[[Charles Darwin]] explored peloria in ''Antirrhinum'' (snapdragon) while researching the inheritance of floral characteristics for his ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1868|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hoo5AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA33 33–34]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later research, using ''[[Digitalis purpurea]]'', showed that his results&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1868|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hoo5AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA46 46]}}&lt;/ref&gt; were largely in line with [[Gregor Mendel|Mendelian]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Keeble, Frederick |author2=Pellew, C |author3=Jones, WN |title=The Inheritance of Peloria and Flower-Colour in Foxgloves (''Digitalis purpurea'') |journal=New Phytologist |volume=9 |issue= |pages= |year=1910 |jstor=2427515|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1910.tb05554.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symmetry groups==

If we consider only those flowers which consist in a single flower, rather than a flower head or [[inflorescence]], we can group the flowers into a relatively small number of 2D symmetry groups. [[Monocots]] are identifiable by their trimerous [[petals]], thus monocots often have [[rotational symmetry]] of order 3. If the flower also has 3 lines of mirror symmetry the group it belongs to is the [[dihedral group]] D3. If not, then it belongs to the [[cyclic group]] C3. [[Eudicots]] with tetramerous or pentamerous petals may have rotational symmetry of order 4 or 5. Again, whether they also have mirror planes decides whether they belong to dihedral (D4 and D5) or cyclic groups (C4 or C5). The [[sepals]] of some monocot flowers develop to replicate the petals, thus, superficially, certain monocots can appear to have rotational symmetry of order 6 and belong to either symmetry group D6 or C6. However, flower symmetry is rarely perfect.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The novel refers to contemporary events including the murder of [[Hilda Murrell]], the [[Battle of Orgreave]], the involvement of the police and [[MI5]], and the [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)#NUM links with Libya and the Soviet Union|NUM's links with the Soviet Union and Libya]].

==Structure and style==
Each chapter begins with "day by day" accounts from two striking miners, Martin and Peter, written in short conversational sentences. The rest of each chapter is written in a more standard style.

==Reception==
The book was awarded the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for literature in 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3508">In [[esoteric]] and [[occult]] teachings, '''giants''' are beings who live on [[spiritual (spiritual plane)|spiritual]], [[etheric (etheric plane)|etheric]] and [[physical (physical plane)|physical]] [[planes of existence]]. Giants were a popular theme in [[Theosophy (disambiguation)|theosophical]] [[literature]], [[Atlantis]], [[lost continents]] and later the [[earth mysteries]] movement of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} 

==History==
The concept of giants was discussed by the [[theosophist]] and [[occult]] author [[Blavatsky]] who wrote about the existence of giants in her book ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' connecting them to her theory of [[root races]] and claiming they correspond with [[Hindu cycle of the universe]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}  According to theosophists, ape-like giants were the third [[root race]] who lived on the continent of [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gardner, Fads and fallacies in the name of science, 1957, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophists also linked giants to the Atlantean race.

The [[Germans|German]] [[occultist]] [[Guido von List]] was influenced by Blavatsky's writings on giants and mixed together [[paganism]], [[mythology]], and theosophy, creating a basis for the belief in giants living in different realms based on the first four rounds of the root race theory.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults and Their Influence on Nazi Ideology, 1993, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz]], an [[Egyptologist]] and [[tradition]]alist, believed that giants had roamed the [[earth]], and that after the fall of [[Adam]], humanity fell into a state of degeneration.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Lachman, Politics and the Occult: The Left, the Right, and the Radically Unseen, 2008, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lewis Spence]], a writer on mythology, was critical of theosophy but accepted the existence of giants. He researched [[English folklore]] and mythology depicting such giants such as [[Gog and Magog|Magog]] and the British giant [[Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Spence, 1976, The Occult Sciences in Atlantis, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Another writer who was opposed to occultism was the British [[journalist]] and author [[William Comyns Beaumont]]. Like Spence, he accepted the existence of giants based on folklore, mythology, and [[archeology]]. Beaumont believed that [[United Kingdom|Britain]] was the location of [[Atlantis]] and that it was occupied by a giant race of [[Aryan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IZNKVA1JcWwC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=comyns+beaumont+giants&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rlr3TcGTBpOctwejoeS_Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEUQuwUwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Karl Shaw, Curing Hiccups with Small Fires: A Delightful Miscellany of Great British Eccentrics]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1970s many of the authors of the [[earth mysteries]] movement in Britain wrote about Giants. [[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]] wrote about the existence of giants in his book ''The View over Atlantis''. Anthony Roberts wrote the book ''Sowers of Thunder: Giants in Myth and History'' in 1978, in which he claimed that giants were the original inhabitants of the  [[British Isles]] and linked [[Alfred Watkins]]' [[ley lines]] to the British giants.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Chippindale, Stonehenge complete, Cornell University Press, 1983, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Assembly of the United Nations approved by consensus two resolutions presented by [[Bolivia]]. The first, entitled “Harmony with Nature,” asks to convene an interactive dialogue on [[International Mother Earth Day]] on April 22, 2011. Topics will include methods for promoting a holistic approach to harmony with nature, and an exchange of national experiences regarding criteria and indicators to measure sustainable development in harmony with nature.

This resolution recognizes that “human beings are an inseparable part of nature, and that they cannot damage it without severely damaging themselves.” It also seeks to contribute to the preparatory process for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boliviaun.net/cms/?cat=136 |title=Rights of Mother Earth « Bolivia UN |publisher=Boliviaun.net |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/president/65/initiatives/HarmonywithNature.html |title=Initiatives of the President of the 65th Session - General Assembly of the United Nations |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherearthrights.org/2009/12/22/the-united-nations-approved-the-resolution-%E2%80%9Charmony-with-nature%E2%80%9D-proposed-by-bolivia/ |title=The United Nations approved the resolution "Harmony with Nature" proposed by Bolivia « Mother Earth |publisher=Motherearthrights.org |date=2009-12-22 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boliviaun.net/cms/?p=1975 |title=UN Approves Two More Resolutions by Bolivia / ONU aprueba dos resoluciones más propuestas por Bolivia « Bolivia UN |publisher=Boliviaun.net |date=2010-12-23 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boliviaun.net/cms/?p=2016 |title=UN General Assembly Debates Harmony With Nature « Bolivia UN |publisher=Boliviaun.net |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwccc.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/speech-by-bolivia-at-un-dialogue-on-harmony-with-nature/ |title=Speech by Bolivia at UN Dialogue on Harmony with Nature « World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth |publisher=Pwccc.wordpress.com |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text of the proposal==

The proposal in its entirety, verbatim, follows.

'''Preliminary Proposal of the Plurinational State of Bolivia for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20)'''

The achievement of [[sustainable development]] in the 21st Century requires a Social and Ecological Contract among human beings and our Mother Earth that brings together and builds upon the progress made in the [[World Charter for Nature]] (1982),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/37/a37r007.htm |title=A/RES/37/7. World Charter for Nature |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Rio Declaration]] (1992),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/dsd_aofw_sids/sids_pdfs/BPOA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Earth Charter]] (2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ECI Sec 3 |url=http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/pages/Read-the-Charter.html |title=Read the Charter |publisher=Earthcharterinaction.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World People’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth]] (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwccc.wordpress.com/ |title=World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth |publisher=Pwccc.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It would include the following premises:

'''I. WE ARE BREAKING THE BALANCE OF THE EARTH SYSTEM'''

1. Twenty years after the “Rio Declaration,” it is necessary to update its First Principle such that it would state: “Human beings and nature are at the center of concerns for sustainable development.” It is essential to get beyond this [[anthropocentric]] vision. Not only do human beings “have the right to a healthy life,” but so too does nature, which is the basis of survival for all species including humans.

2. Nature is not just a set of resources that can be exploited, modified, altered, privatized, commercialized and transformed without any consequences. Earth is the only home we have. The Earth does not belong to us; we belong to the Earth.

3. The Earth is a living system. It is an indivisible, interdependent and interrelated community {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} human beings, nature, the atmosphere, the [[hydrosphere]], and the [[geosphere]]. Any substantive alteration of one of its components can affect other areas and the entire system. The Earth is the source of life. It is a system that coordinates physical, chemical, biological and ecological elements in a manner that makes life possible. Through the term ''[[wikt:Mother Earth|Mother Earth]]'', we express this relationship of belonging to a system and respect for our home.

4. Human activity is altering the dynamics and functioning of the Earth system to a degree never before seen. We have exceeded the limits of our system. We have broken harmony with nature. We are living through a series of rising crises that could cause the collapse of the system. It is essential to restore, affirm and guarantee the existence, integrity, interrelation, interaction and regeneration of the Earth system as a whole and of all of its components.

'''II. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE 21ST CENTURY'''

5. In this century, the two central challenges of sustainable development are to overcome poverty and inequality, and to reestablish balance within the Earth system. Both objectives are intrinsically linked, and one cannot be achieved without the other.

6. It is essential to recognize and affirm that growth has limits. The pursuit of unending development on a finite planet is unsustainable and impossible. It is unsustainable and impossible. The limit to development is defined by the regenerative capacity of the Earth’s vital cycles. When growth begins to break that balance, as we see with global warming, we can no longer speak of it as development, but rather, the deterioration and destruction of our home. A certain level of growth and industrialization is needed to satisfy basic needs and guarantee the human rights of a population, but this level of “necessary development” is not about permanent growth, but rather, balance among humans and with nature.

7. Sustainable development seeks to [[eradicate poverty]] in order to live well, not generate wealthy people who live at the expense of the poor. The goal is the satisfaction of basic human needs in order to allow for the development of human capabilities and human happiness, strengthening community among human beings and with Mother Earth. In a world in which 1% of the population controls 50% of the wealth of the planet, it will not be possible to eradicate poverty or restore harmony with nature.

8. To end poverty and achieve an equitable distribution of well being, the basic resources and firms should be in the hands of the public sector and society. Only a society that controls its principal sources of income can aspire to a just distribution of the benefits needed to eliminate poverty.

9. The so-called “developed” countries must reduce their levels of over-consumption to reestablish harmony among human beings and with nature, allowing for the sustainable development of all developing countries. The ecological footprint of the developed countries is between 3 and 5 times larger than the average ecological footprint that the Earth system can sustain without an impact on its vital cycles.

10. The developing countries should follow new paradigms different from those used by developed countries in order to attend to the basic needs of their populations and reestablish harmony with nature. It is not sustainable or viable for all countries to follow the example of developed countries without causing our system to collapse.

11. Sustainable development cannot happen only at the national level. The well being of a country is only sustainable if it contributes to the well being of the entire system. The pillar of sustainable development can only be achieved from a global perspective. The so-called developed countries are still far from reaching sustainable development.

'''III. TOOLS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT'''

12. In an interdependent and interconnected system like that of Earth, we cannot recognize the rights of the human part of the system without affecting the rest of the system. To reestablish balance with nature, we must acknowledge its intrinsic value and clearly establish the obligations of humans toward nature, and also recognize that nature has rights that should be respected, promoted, and defended. Just as human beings have rights, the Mother Earth also has the right to exist, the right to maintain its vital cycles, the right to regeneration, the right to be free from structural alteration, and the right to relate to the other parts of the Earth system. Without respecting and guaranteeing the rights of nature, it is not possible to guarantee human rights and achieve sustainable development.

13. We have to end the system of consumption, waste and luxury. Millions of people are dying of hunger in the poorest parts of the globe, while in the richest areas, millions of dollars are spent to combat obesity. We must change the unsustainable patterns of consumption, production, and waste through public policy, regulations, and the conscious and active participation of society. This includes promoting ethics that value human beings for what they are, not what they have.

14. To guarantee the human right to water, education, health, communication, transportation, energy and sanitation, above all in the very poor and marginalized sectors, the provision of these services must be essentially public and based on efficient social management, not private business.

15. States should ensure the right of their populations to proper nutrition by strengthening food sovereignty policies that promote: a) food production by farmers, indigenous peoples and small agricultural producers; b) access to land, water, seeds, credit and other resources for family and community producers; c) the development of social and public enterprises for food production, distribution, and sale that prevent hoarding and contribute to the stability of food prices in domestic markets, thus halting speculative practices and the destruction of local production; d) the right of citizens to define what goods they wish to consume, the origins of those goods and how they are produced; e) consumption of what is necessary and the prioritization of local production; f) practices that contribute to reestablishing harmony with nature, avoiding greater desertification, deforestation, and destruction of biological diversity; g) the promotion of the use of indigenous seeds and traditional knowledge. Food production and commercialization must be socially regulated and cannot be left to free market forces.

16. Without water, there is no life. Humans and all living things have the [[right to water]], but water also has rights. All States and peoples worldwide should work together in solidarity to ensure that loss of vegetation, deforestation, the pollution of the atmosphere and contamination are prevented from continuing to alter the hydrological cycle. These cause [[desertification]], lack of food, temperature increase, [[sea level rise]], migrations, [[acid rain]], and physical-chemical changes that can cause ecosystems to die.

17. Forests are essential to the balance and integrity of planet Earth and a key element in the proper functioning of its ecosystems and the broader system of which we are a part. Thus we cannot consider them as simple providers of goods and services for human beings. The protection, preservation and recuperation of forests is required to reestablish the balance of the Earth system. Forests are not plantations that can be reduced to their capacity to capture carbon and provide environmental services. The maintenance of native forests and woodlands is essential for the water cycle, the atmosphere, biodiversity, the prevention of flooding, and the preservation of ecosystems. Forests are also home to indigenous peoples and communities. The preservation of forests should be pursued through integral and participatory management plans financed with public funding from developed countries.

18. It is essential to guarantee a real and effective reduction of [[greenhouse gases]], particularly on the part of the developed countries historically responsible for climate change, in order to stabilize the increase in temperature to 1&amp;nbsp;°C during this century. We must therefore strengthen the [[Kyoto Protocol]], not replace it with a more flexible voluntary agreement in which each country does what it chooses. It is necessary to eliminate carbon market mechanisms and offsets so that real domestic reductions are made within the countries with said obligations.

19. All forms of violence against women are incompatible with sustainable development, including violence done to women in militarily occupied territories and domestic or sexual violence that treats women as objects.

20. In order for sustainable development to exist, is essential to guarantee the full application of the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]].

21. Under the framework of common but differentiated responsibilities established in the 1992 Rio Declaration, the so-called developed countries must assume and pay their historical [[ecological debt]] for having contributed the most to the deterioration of the Earth system. The payment of this ecological debt to developing countries and the sectors most affected among their own populations consists of the transfer financial resources from public sources and also the effective transfer of appropriate technologies required by developing countries.

22. The resources developed countries dedicate to their defense, security and war budgets should be used to address the effects of climate change and the imbalance with nature. It is inexcusable that 1.5 trillion dollars in public funding are used on these budgets, while, to address the impacts of climate change in developing countries, they want to dedicate just 100 billion dollars from public and private funds as well as market sources by 2020.

23. To address the challenge of achieving sustainable development in the so-called developing countries, a [[financial transaction tax]] should be created to help build a Sustainable Development Fund that would be managed by developing countries.

24. Sustainable development requires a new international financial architecture to replace the [[World Bank]] and the [[IMF]] with entities that are democratic and transparent, that refrain from imposing conditions or structural adjustments, are controlled by the developing countries, and are based on the principles of solidarity and complementarity rather than commercialization and privatization.

25. It is essential to promote the exchange of scientific and technical knowledge and to remove intellectual property barriers to allow a true transfer of environmentally friendly technologies from developed countries to developing countries. An effective Technology Transfer Mechanism should be created based on the need for socially, culturally, and ecologically appropriate technologies in the countries of the South. This mechanism should not be a showcase for the sale of technologies by rich countries.

26. [[Intellectual property rights]] over genes, microorganisms and other forms of life are a threat to [[food sovereignty]], [[biodiversity]], access to medicine and other basic elements of the survival of low-income populations. All forms of [[intellectual property over life]] should be abolished.

27. [[Gross Domestic Product]] is not an adequate means of measuring the development and well being of a society. Thus it is necessary to create indicators for measuring the environmental destruction caused by certain economic activities in order to advance toward sustainable development in harmony with nature, integrating social and environmental aspects that are not aimed at the commercialization of nature and its functions.

28. Respect for the [[sovereignty of States]] is essential in the management and protection of nature under the framework of cooperation among States.

29. There is no single solution for all peoples. Human beings are diverse. Our peoples have their own unique cultures and identities. To destroy a culture is to threaten the identity of an entire people. Capitalism attempts to homogenize us all to convert us into consumers. There has not been, nor will there ever be, a single model for life that can save the world. We live and act in a pluralistic world, and a pluralistic world should respect diversity, which is itself synonymous with life. Respect for peaceful and harmonious complementarity among the diverse cultures and economies, without exploitation or discrimination against any single one, is essential for saving the planet, humanity, and life.

30. Peace is essential for sustainable development. There is no worse aggression against humanity and Mother Earth than war and violence. War destroys life. Nobody and nothing is safe from war. Those that fight suffer, as do those that are forced to go without bread in order to feed the war. Wars squander life and natural resources.

31. An International Tribunal of [[Environmental justice|Environmental]] and [[Climate Justice]] must be established to judge and sanction crimes against nature that transcend national borders, violating the rights of nature and affecting humanity.

32. The problems affecting humanity and nature are global in nature, and to address them requires the exercise of global democracy through the development of mechanisms of consultation and decision-making such as referendums, plebiscites, or popular consultations so that the citizens of the world as a whole may speak.

33. Sustainable development is incompatible with all forms of imperialism and neocolonialism. It is essential to end the imposition of conditionalities, military interventions, coups and different forms of blackmail in order to stop imperialism and neocolonialism.

34. The collective global response needed to confront the crisis we face requires structural changes. We must change the system, not the climate or the Earth system. In the hands of capitalism, everything is converted into merchandise: water, earth genomes, ancestral cultures, justice, ethics, life. It is essential to develop a pluralistic system based on the culture of life and harmony among human beings and with nature; a system that promotes sustainable development in the framework of solidarity, complementarity, equity, social and economic justice, social participation, respect for diversity, and peace.

'''IV. DANGEROUS AND FALSE SOLUTIONS'''

35. Not all that glitters is gold. Not all that is labeled “green” is environmentally friendly. We must use the precautionary principle and deeply analyze the different “green” alternatives that are presented before proceeding with their experimentation and implementation.

36. Nature cannot be subject to manipulation by new technologies without consequences in the future. History shows us that many dangerous technologies have been released in the market before their environmental or health impacts are known, or before their social and economic impacts on poor people and developing countries are understood. This is currently the case with genetically modified organisms, agrochemicals, biofuels, nanotechnology, and synthetic biology. These technologies should be avoided.

37. [[Climate engineering|Geoengineering]] and all forms of artificial manipulation of the climate should be prohibited, for they bring the enormous risk of further destabilizing the climate, biodiversity and nature.

38. It is necessary to create public and multilateral mechanisms within the United Nations to evaluate in an independent manner and without conflict of interest the potential environmental, health, social, and economic impacts of new technologies before they are spread. This mechanism must involve transparency and social participation by potentially affected groups.

39. The current ecological and climate crisis has put in jeopardy all of life on planet Earth, and thus it requires deep solutions based on the real causes of the climate crisis. It cannot be reduced to a simple market failure, which is a reductionist and narrow view.

40. The solution is not to put a price on nature. Nature is not a form of capital. The green economy should not distort the fundamental principles of sustainable development. It is wrong to say that we only value that which has a price, an owner, and brings profits. The market mechanisms that permit exchange among human beings and nations have proven incapable of contributing to an equitable distribution of wealth. To use an approach based on market principles and private appropriation to try to resolve the problem of inequality – itself a product of capitalism – is like trying to put out a fire with gasoline.

41. It is wrong to fragment nature into “environmental services” with a monetary value for market exchange. It is wrong to put a price on the capacity of forests to act as [[carbon sinks]], and worse to promote their commercialization as does [[REDD]] (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). The market for carbon credits based on forests will lead to: a) noncompliance with effective emission reduction commitments by developed countries; b) the bulk of resources being appropriated by intermediaries and financial entities and rarely benefiting countries, indigenous peoples and forests themselves; c) the generation of speculative bubbles based on the sale and purchase of said certificates; and d) the establishment of new property rights over the capacity of forests to capture carbon dioxide, which will clash with the sovereign rights of States and the indigenous peoples that live in forests. To promote market mechanisms based on the economic needs of developing countries is a new form of neocolonialism.

42. [[“Green” capitalism]] will bring about natural resource grabbing, displacing humanity and nature from the essential elements needed for their survival. The drive for profit, instead of reestablishing harmony within the system, will provoke even greater imbalances, [[wealth condensation|concentrations of wealth]], and speculative processes.

'''V. GLOBAL GOVERNMENT AND SOCIAL PARTICIPATION'''

43. It is necessary to establish a United Nations organization to promote sustainable development in harmony with nature. This organization should articulate and unite the different authorities involved in order to avoid overlapping efforts and achieve effective coordination. Developing countries should have majority representation in said organization, and its functioning should be democratic, transparent, and accountable.

44. This organization should articulate all of the conventions regarding nature without leaving aside issues central to the United Nations, such as water.

45. Social participation is essential in this new organization. Workers, women, farmers, indigenous peoples, young people, scientists, and all sectors of society should be represented. The private sector cannot have the same amount of influence as the social sectors, given that, by definition, its goal is to create profit rather than social wellbeing. Effective mechanisms for interaction among all social actors are required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncsd2012.org/rio20/index.php?page=view&amp;nr=212&amp;type=12&amp;menu=23&amp;template=435 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402182458/http://www.uncsd2012.org/rio20/index.php?page=view&amp;nr=212&amp;type=12&amp;menu=23&amp;template=435 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-04-02 |title=Rio+20 - United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development |publisher=Uncsd2012.org |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2011-10-15}} &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35228">The '''military funding of science''' has had a powerful transformative effect on the practice and products of [[scientific research]] since the early 20th century.  Particularly since [[World War I]], [[military technology|advanced science-based technologies]] have been viewed as essential elements of a successful military.

World War I is often called "the chemists’ war", both for the extensive [[Poison gas in World War I|use of poison gas]] and the importance of [[nitrates]] and advanced [[high explosive]]s.   Poison gas, beginning in 1915 with [[chlorine]] from the powerful German dye industry, was used extensively by the Germans and the British ; over the course of the war, scientists on both sides raced to develop more and more potent chemicals and devise countermeasures against the newest enemy gases.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Robert and Jeremy Paxman.  ''A Higher Form of Killing: The Secret History of Chemical and Biological Warfare''.  2002.  Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Physicists also contributed to the war effort, developing wireless communication technologies and sound-based methods of detecting [[U-boat]]s, resulting in the first tenuous long-term connections between academic science and the military.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, Daniel J.  ''The Physicists: The History of a Scientific Community in Modern America''.  New York: Alfred K. Knopf, 1971. pp 137-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War II]] marked a massive increase in the military funding of science, particularly physics.  In addition to the [[Manhattan Project]] and the resulting [[nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]], British and American work on [[radar]] was widespread and ultimately highly influential in the course of the war; radar enabled detection of enemy ships and aircraft, as well as the radar-based [[proximity fuze]].  Mathematical [[cryptography]], [[meteorology]], and [[aerospace engineering|rocket science]] were also central to the war effort, with military-funded wartime advances having a significant long-term effect on each discipline.  The technologies employed at the end&amp;mdash;[[jet aircraft]], radar and proximity fuzes, and the atomic bomb&amp;mdash;were radically different from pre-war technology; military leaders came to view continued advances in technology as the critical element for success in future wars.  The advent of the [[Cold War]] solidified the links between military institutions and academic science, particularly in the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], so that even during a period of nominal peace military funding continued to expand.  Funding spread to the [[social sciences]] as well as the [[natural sciences]], and whole new fields, such as [[digital computing]], were born of military patronage.  Following the [[Cold War (1985-1991)|end of the Cold War]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], military funding of science has decreased substantially, but much of the American [[military-scientific complex]] remains in place.

The sheer scale of military funding for science since World War II has instigated a large body of historical literature analyzing the effects of that funding, especially for American science.  Since [[Paul Forman]]’s 1987 article “Behind quantum electronics: National security as a basis for physical research in the United State, 1940-1960,” there has been an ongoing historical debate over precisely how and to what extent military funding affected the course of scientific research and discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Forman, Paul.  "Behind quantum electronics: National security as basis for physical research in the United States, 1940-1960," ''Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences'', Vol. 18, Pt. 1, pp 149-229.&lt;/ref&gt;  Forman and others have argued that military funding fundamentally redirected science—particularly physics—toward applied research, and that military technologies predominantly formed the basis for subsequent research even in areas of basic science; ultimately the very culture and ideals of science were colored by extensive collaboration between scientists and military planners.  An alternate view has been presented by [[Daniel Kevles]], that while military funding provided many new opportunities for scientists and dramatically expanded the scope of physical research, scientists by-and-large retained their intellectual autonomy.

==Science and military technology before the modern era==
[[Image:Replica catapult.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Replica catapult at [[Château des Baux]], [[France]]]]
While there were numerous instances of military support for scientific work before the 20th century, these were typically isolated instances; knowledge gained from technology was generally far more important for the development of science than scientific knowledge was to technological innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, Barton C.  "The Machines of War: Western Military Technology 1850-2000."  ''History and Technology'', Vol. 21, No. 3, September 2005, pp 255-300.  p 255.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thermodynamics]], for example, is a science partly born from military technology: one of the many sources of the [[first law of thermodynamics]] was [[Count Rumford]]’s observation of the heat produced by boring [[cannon]] barrels.&lt;ref&gt;von Baeyer, Hans Christian.  ''Warmth Disperses and Time Passes: The History of Heat''.  New York: The Modern Library, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mathematics was important in the development of the Greek [[catapult]] and other weapons,&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, "The Machines of War," footnote 1.&lt;/ref&gt; but analysis of [[ballistics]] was also important for the development of mathematics, while [[Galileo]] tried to promote the telescope as a military instrument to the military-minded [[Republic of Venice]] before turning it to the skies while seeking the [[patronage]] of the [[Medici]] court in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Biagioli, Mario.  ''Galileo, Courtier: The Practice of Science in the Culture of Absolutism''.  Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, craft-based innovation, disconnected from the formal systems of science, was the key to military technology well into the 19th century.

[[Image:Interchangeable parts.gif|thumb|left|200px|Interchangeable gun parts, illustrated in the 1832 ''Edinburgh Encyclopaedia'']]
Even craft-based military technologies were not generally produced by military funding.  Instead, craftsmen and inventors developed weapons and military tools independently and actively sought the interest of military patrons afterward.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, "The Machines of War," p 256.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the rise of [[engineering]] as a profession in the 18th century, governments and military leaders did try to harness the methods of both science and engineering for more specific ends, but frequently without success.   In the decades leading up to the [[French Revolution]], French artillery officers were often trained as engineers, and military leaders from this mathematical tradition attempted to transform the process of weapons manufacture from a craft-based enterprise to an organized and standardized system based on engineering principles and [[interchangeable parts]] (pre-dating the work of [[Eli Whitney]] in the U.S.).  During the Revolution, even natural scientists participated directly, attempting to create “weapons more powerful than any we possess” to aid the cause of the new French Republic, though there were no means for the revolutionary army to fund such work.&lt;ref&gt;Gillispie, Charles Coulston.  "Science and secret weapons development in Revolutionary France, 1792–1804."  ''Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences'', Vol. 23, No. 1, pp 35–152.  Quote from excerpt of [[Georges Cuvier]]’s eulogy of [[Claude-Louis Berthollet]], p 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of these efforts, however, was ultimately unsuccessful in producing militarily useful results.  A slightly different outcome came from the longitude prize of the 18th century, offered by the British government for an accurate method of determining a ship’s [[longitude]] at sea (essential for the safe navigation of the powerful British navy): intended to promote—and financially reward—a scientific solution, it was instead won by a scientific outsider, the clockmaker [[John Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sobel, Dava]].  ''[[Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time]]''.  Penguin, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the naval utility of [[astronomy]] did help increase the number of capable astronomers and focus research on developing more powerful and versatile instruments.

Through the 19th century, science and technology grew closer together, particularly through electrical and acoustic inventions and the corresponding mathematical theories.  The late 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed a trend toward military mechanization, with the advent of repeating rifles with [[smokeless powder]], long-range artillery, [[high explosive]]s, [[machine gun]]s, and mechanized transport along with [[telegraph]]ic and later [[wireless telegraph|wireless]] battlefield communication.  Still, independent inventors, scientists and engineers were largely responsible for these drastic changes in military technology (with the exception of the development of [[battleship]]s, which could only have been created through organized large-scale effort).&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, “The Machines of War,” pp 256-257.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I and the interwar years==
{{see also|Technology during World War I}}
[[World War I]] marked the first large-scale mobilization of science for military purposes.  Prior to the war, the American military ran a few small laboratories as well as the [[United States Bureau of Standards|Bureau of Standards]], but independent inventors and industrial firms predominated.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, ''The Physicists'', pp 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly in Europe, military-directed scientific research and development was minimal.  The powerful new technologies that led to [[trench warfare]], however, reversed the traditional advantage of fast-moving offensive tactics; fortified positions supported by machine guns and artillery resulted in high attrition but strategic stalemate.  Militaries turned to scientists and engineers for even newer technologies, but the introduction of [[tank]]s and [[aircraft]] had only a marginal impact; the [[Poison gas in World War I|use of poison gas]] made a tremendous psychological impact, but decisively favored neither side.  The war ultimately turned on maintaining adequate supplies of materials, a problem also addressed by military-funded science&amp;mdash;and, through the international chemical industry, closely related to the advent of chemical warfare.

The Germans introduced gas as a weapon in part because [[naval blockade]]s limited their supply of [[nitrate]] for explosives, while the massive German [[dye]] industry could easily produce [[chlorine]] and [[organic chemical]]s in large amounts.  Industrial capacity was completely mobilized for war, and [[Fritz Haber]] and other industrial scientists were eager to contribute to the German cause; soon they were closely integrated into the military hierarchy as they tested the most effective ways of producing and delivering weaponized chemicals.  Though the initial impetus for gas warfare came from outside the military, further developments in chemical weapon technology might be considered military-funded, considering the blurring of lines between industry and nation in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Harris and Paxman, ''A Higher Form of Killing'',  pp 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:British 55th Division gas casualties 10 April 1918.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Poison gas casualties from the [[Battle of Estaires]], April 10, 1918]]
Following the first chlorine attack by the Germans in May 1915, the British quickly moved to recruit scientists for developing their own gas weapons.  Gas research escalated on both sides, with chlorine followed by [[phosgene]], a variety of [[tear gas]]es, and [[mustard gas]].  A wide array of research was conducted on the physiological effects of other gases, such and [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[arsenic]] compounds, and a host of complex organic chemicals.  The British built from scratch what became an expansive research facility at [[Porton Down]], which remains a significant military research institution into the 21st century.  Unlike many earlier military-funded scientific ventures, the research at Porton Down did not stop when the war ended or an immediate goal was achieved.  In fact, every effort was made to create an attractive research environment for top scientists, and chemical weapons development continued apace&amp;mdash;though in secret&amp;mdash;through the interwar years and into World War II.  German military-backed gas warfare research did not resume until the Nazi era, following the 1936 discovery of [[tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]], the first nerve agent, through industrial [[insecticide]] research.

In the United States, the established tradition of engineering was explicitly competing with the rising discipline of physics for World War I military largess.  A host of inventors, led by [[Thomas Edison]] and his newly created [[Naval Consulting Board]], cranked out thousands of inventions to solve military problems and aid the war effort, while academic scientists worked through the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC) led by [[Robert Millikan]].  [[Submarine]] detection was the most important problem that both the physicists and inventors hoped to solve, as German [[U-boat]]s were decimating the crucial naval supply lines from the U.S. to England.  Edison’s Board produced very few useful innovations, but NRC research resulted in a moderately successful sound-based methods for locating submarines and hidden ground-based artillery, as well as useful navigational and photographic equipment for aircraft.  Because of the success of academic science in solving specific military problems, the NRC was retained after the war’s end, though it gradually decoupled from the military.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, ''The Physicists'', pp 102-154&lt;/ref&gt;

Many industrial and academic chemists and physicists came under military control during the Great War, but post-war research by the Royal Engineers Experimental Station at Porton Down and the continued operation of the National Research Council were exceptions to the overall pattern; wartime chemistry funding was a temporary redirection of a field largely driven by industry and later medicine, while physics grew closer to industry than to the military.  The discipline of modern meteorology, however, was largely built from military funding.  During World War I, the French civilian meteorological infrastructure was largely absorbed into the military.  The introduction of military aircraft during the war as well as the role of wind and weather in the success or failure of gas attacks meant meteorological advice was in high demand.  The French army (among others) created its own supplementary meteorological service as well, retraining scientists from other fields to staff it.  At war's end, the military continued to control French meteorology, sending weathermen to French colonial interests and integrating weather service with the growing air corps; most of the early-twentieth century growth in European meteorology was the direct result of military funding.&lt;ref&gt;Pyenson, Lewis and Susan Sheets-Pyenson.  ''Servants of Nature: A History of Scientific Institutions, Enterprises, and Sensibilities''.  New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 1999.  pp 309-311.&lt;/ref&gt;   World War II would result in a similar transformation of American meteorology, initiating a transition from an [[apprenticeship]] system for training weathermen (based on intimate knowledge of local trends and geography) to the university-based, science-intensive system that has predominated since.

==World War II==
{{see also|Technology during World War II}}
If World War I was the chemists’ war, World War II was the physicists’ war.  As with other [[total war]]s, it is difficult to draw a line between military funding and more spontaneous military-scientific collaboration during World War II.  Well before the [[Polish September Campaign|Invasion of Poland]], [[nationalism]] was a powerful force in the German physics community (see [[Deutsche Physik]]); the military mobilization of physicists was all but irresistible after the rise of [[National Socialism]].  German and Allied investigations of the possibility of a nuclear bomb began in 1939 at the initiative of civilian scientists, but by 1942 the respective militaries were heavily involved.  The [[German nuclear energy project]] had two independent teams, a civilian-controlled team under [[Werner Heisenberg]] and a military-controlled led by [[Kurt Diebner]]; the latter was more explicitly aimed at producing a bomb (as opposed to a power reactor) and received much more funding from the Nazis, though neither was ultimately successful.&lt;ref&gt;The extent to which Heisenberg’s team was devoted to aiding the Nazi’s by producing an atomic bomb is a matter of some historical dispute.  However, most recent scholarship suggests that the stagnation of the German project stemmed from Heisenberg’s doubts about the feasibility rather than the desirability of a Nazi bomb.  See: Rose, Paul Lawrence.  ''Heisenberg and the Nazi Atomic Bomb Project: A Study in German Culture''.  Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the [[Manhattan Project]] and other projects of the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] resulted in a much more extensive military-scientific venture, the scale of which dwarfed previous military-funded research projects.  Theoretical work by a number of British and American scientists resulted in significant optimism about the possibility of a [[nuclear chain reaction]]. As the physicists convinced military leaders of the potential of nuclear weapons, funding for actual development was ratcheted up rapidly.  A number of large laboratories were created across the United States for work on different aspects of the bomb, while many existing facilities were reoriented to bomb-related work; some were university-managed while others were government-run, but all were ultimately funded and directed by the military.&lt;ref&gt;[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], the University of Chicago’s [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] (now [[Argonne National Laboratory]]), [[Hanford Site]] (now defunct), and [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] were all created during the Manhattan Project, while Berkeley’s [[Radiation Laboratory]] and smaller labs across the country became part of the project as well.  Among others, see: Smyth, Henry DeWolf.  [[Smyth Report|''Atomic Energy for Military Purposes: The Official Report on the Development of the Atomic Bomb under the Auspices of the United States Government, 1940-1945]]''.   Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1945. Rhodes, Richard. ''The Making of the Atomic Bomb''.  New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  The May 1945 surrender of Germany, the original intended target for the bomb, did virtually nothing to slow the project’s momentum.  After Japan’s surrender immediately following the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], many scientists returned to academia or industry, but the Manhattan Project infrastructure was too large—and too effective—to be dismantled wholesale; it became the model for future military-scientific work, in the U.S. and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, ''The Physicists'', pp. 324-348.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other wartime physics research, particularly in [[rocket]]ry and radar technology, was less significant in popular culture but much more significant for the outcome of the war.  German rocketry was driven by the pursuit of ''[[Wunderwaffe]]n'', resulting in the [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] [[ballistic missile]]; the technology as well as the personal expertise of the German rocketry community was absorbed by the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. rocket programs after the war, forming the basis of long-term military funded rocketry, ballistic missile, and later space research.  Rocket science was only beginning to make impact by the final years of the war.  German rockets created fear and destruction in London, but had only modest military significance, while air-to-ground rockets enhanced the power of American air strikes; [[jet aircraft]] also went into service by the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, ''The Machines of War,'' p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;  Radar work before and during the war provided even more of an advantage for the Allies.  British physicists pioneered [[long-wave radar]], developing an effective system for detecting incoming German air forces.  Work on potentially more precise [[short-wave radar]] was turned over to the U.S.; several thousand academic physicists and engineers not participating the Manhattan Project did radar work, particularly at MIT and Stanford, resulting in [[microwave]] radar systems that could resolve more detail in incoming flight formations.  Further refinement of microwave technology led to proximity fuzes, which greatly enhanced the ability of the U.S. Navy to defend against Japanese bombers.  Microwave production, detection and manipulation also formed the technical foundation to complement the institutional foundation of the Manhattan Project in much post-war defense research.

==American Cold War science==
In the years immediately following World War II, the military was by far the most significant patron of university science research in the U.S., and the national labs also continued to flourish.&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, Roger.  "Science, Universities, and National Defense, 1945-1970," ''Osiris'' (2nd series), Vol. 7, 1992, ''Science after '40'', pp 26-48.  p 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  After two years in political limbo (but with work on nuclear power and bomb manufacture continuing apace) the Manhattan Project became a permanent arm of the government as the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]].  The Navy—inspired by the success of military-directed wartime research—created its own R&amp;D organization, the [[Office of Naval Research]], which would preside over an expanded long-term research program at [[Naval Research Laboratory]] as well as fund a variety of university-based research.  Military money following up the wartime radar research led to explosive growth in both [[electronics]] research and electronics manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;Forman, "Behind quantum electronics," pp 159-160.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] became an independent service branch from the Army and established its own research and development system, and the Army followed suit (though it was less invested in academic science than the Navy or Air Force).  Meanwhile, the perceived communist menace of the Soviet Union caused tensions—and military budgets—to escalate rapidly.

The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] primarily funded what has been broadly described as “physical research,” but to reduce this to merely chemistry and physics is misleading.  Military patronage benefited a large number of fields, and in fact helped create a number of the modern [[scientific discipline]]s.  At [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], for example, electronics, [[aerospace engineering]], [[nuclear physics]], and [[materials science]]&amp;mdash;all physics, broadly speaking&amp;mdash;each developed in different directions, becoming increasingly independent of parent disciplines as they grew and pursued defense-related research agendas.  What began as interdepartmental laboratories became the centers for graduate teaching and research innovation thanks to the broad scope of defense funding.  The need to keep up with corporate technology research (which was receiving the lion’s share of defense contracts) also prompted many science labs to establish close relationships with industry.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, Stuart.  ''The Cold War and American Science: The Military-Industrial-Academic Complex at MIT and Stanford''.  New York: Columbian University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computing===
The complex histories of [[history of computer science|computer science]] and [[history of computer hardware|computer engineering]] were shaped, in the first decades of digital computing, almost entirely by military funding.  Most of the basic component technologies for digital computing were developed through the course of the long-running [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]]-[[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] program to develop an automated radar shield.  Virtually unlimited funds enabled two decades of research that only began producing useful technologies by the end of the 50s; even the final version of the SAGE command and control system had only marginal military utility.  More so than with previously-established disciplines receiving military funding, the culture of computer science was permeated with a [[Cold War]] military perspective.  Indirectly, the ideas of computer science also had a profound effect on [[psychology]], [[cognitive science]] and [[neuroscience]] through the mind-computer analogy.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul  ''The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America''.  Cambridge: MIT Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geosciences and astrophysics===
The [[Outline of earth science|history of earth science]] and the [[history of astrophysics]] were also closely tied to military purposes and funding throughout the Cold War.  American [[geodesy]], [[oceanography]], and [[seismology]] grew from small sub-disciplines in into full-fledged independent disciplines as for several decades, virtually all funding in these fields came from the Department of Defense.  A central goal that tied these disciplines together (even while providing the means for intellectual independence) was the [[figure of the Earth]], the model of the earth’s [[geography]] and [[gravitation]] that was essential for accurate ballistic missiles.  In the 1960s, geodesy was the superficial goal of the satellite program [[Corona (satellite)|CORONA]], while military [[reconnaissance]] was in fact a driving force.  Even for geodetic data, new secrecy guidelines worked to restrict collaboration in a field that had formerly been fundamentally international; the Figure of the Earth had geopolitical significance beyond questions of pure geoscience.  Still, geodesists were able to retain enough autonomy and subvert secrecy limitations enough to make use of the findings of their military research to overturn some of the fundamental theories of geodesy.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, John.  "Crossing the Olentangy River: The Figure of the Earth and the Military-Industrial-Academic-Complex, 1947-1972," ''Studies in the History and Philosophy of Modern Physics'', Vol. 31, No. 3, pp 371-404. 2000
Cloud, John.  "Imaging the World in a Barrel: CORONA and the Clandestine Convergence of the Earth Sciences," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 31, No. 2, pp 231-251.  April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like geodesy and satellite photography research, the advent of [[radio astronomy]] had a military purpose hidden beneath official astrophysical research agenda.  Quantum electronics permitted both revolutionary new methods of analyzing the universe and&amp;mdash;using the same equipment and technology&amp;mdash;the monitoring of Soviet electronic signals.&lt;ref&gt;van Keuren, David K.  "Cold War Science in Black and White: US Intelligence Gathering and Its Scientific Cover at the Naval Research Laboratory, 1948-62," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 31, No. 2, pp 207-229.  April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Military interest in (and funding of) seismology, meteorology and oceanography was in some ways a result of the defense-related payoffs of physics and geodesy.  The immediate goal of funding in these fields was to detect clandestine [[nuclear testing]] and track [[nuclear fallout|fallout radiation]], a necessary precondition for treaties to limit the nuclear weapon technology earlier military research had created.  In particular, the feasibility of monitoring underground nuclear explosions was crucial to the possibility of a [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty|comprehensive]] rather than [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;Barth, Kai-Henrik.  "The Politics of Seismology: Nuclear Testing, Arms Control, and the Transformation of a Discipline," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 33, No. 5, pp 743-781.  October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  But the military-funded growth of these disciplines continued even when no pressing military goals were driving them; as with other natural sciences, the military also found value in having ‘scientists on tap’ for unforeseen future R&amp;D needs.&lt;ref&gt;Mukerji, Chandra.  ''A Fragile Power: Scientists and the State''.  Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological sciences===
The [[biology|biological sciences]] were also affected by military funding, but, with the exception of nuclear physics-related medical and genetic research, largely indirectly.  The most significant funding sources for basic research before the rise of the military-industrial-academic complex were philanthropic organizations such as the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].  After World War II (and to some extent before), the influx of new industrial and military funding opportunities for the physical sciences prompted philanthropies to divest from physics research&amp;mdash;most early work in high-energy physics and biophysics had been the product of foundation grants&amp;mdash;and refocus on biological and medical research.

The [[social sciences]] also found limited military support from the 1940s to the 1960s, but much defense-minded social science research could be—and was—pursued without extensive military funding.  In the 1950s, social scientists tried to emulate the interdisciplinary organizational success of the physical sciences’ Manhattan Project with the synthetic [[behavioral science movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Though somewhat related, "behavioral science" in this context should not be confused with the [[behavioral sciences]] or [[radical behaviorism|behaviorism]], the strictly mechanistic approach to psychology promoted by B. F. Skinner.  See: Robin, Ron.  ''The Making of the Cold War Enemy: Culture and Politics in the Military-Intellectual Complex''.  Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Social scientists actively sought to promote their usefulness to the military, researching topics related to [[propaganda]] (put to use in [[Korean War|Korea]]), decision making, the psychological and sociological causes and effects of [[communism]], and a broad constellation of other topics of Cold War significance.  By the 1960s, economists and political scientists offered up [[modernization theory]] for the cause of Cold War [[nation-building]]; modernization theory found a home in the military in the form of [[Project Camelot]], a study of the process of revolution, as well as in the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]]’s approach to the [[Vietnam War]].  Project Camelot was ultimately canceled because of the concerns it raised about scientific [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] in the context of such a politicized research agenda; though natural sciences were not yet susceptible to implications of the corrupting influence of military and political factors, the social sciences were.&lt;ref&gt;For modernization theory, and its role in the Vietnam War, see: Latham, Michael E.  ''Modernization as Ideology: American Social Science and "Nation-Building" in the Kennedy Era''.  Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2000.
For Project Camelot, see: Solovey, Mark.  "Project Camelot and the 1960s Epistemological Revolution: Rethinking the Politics-Patronage-Social Science Nexus," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 31, No. 2, April 2001, pp 171-206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical debate==
Historian [[Paul Forman]], in his seminal 1987 article, proposed that not only had military funding of science greatly expanded the scope and significance of American physics, it also initiated "a qualitative change in its purposes and character."&lt;ref&gt;Forman, "Behind quantum electronics," p 150.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians of science were beginning to turn to the Cold War relationship between science and the military for detailed study, and Forman’s “distortionist critique” (as [[Roger Geiger]] has described it) served to focus the ensuing debates.&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, Roger.  "Review of ''The Cold War and American Science: The Military-Industrial-Academic Complex at MIT and Stanford''," ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 34 pp 629-631.  1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  Forman and others (e.g., [[Robert Seidel]], Stuart Leslie, and for the history of the social sciences, [[Ron Robin]]) view the influx of military money and the focus on applied rather than basic research as having had, at least partially, a negative impact on the course of subsequent research.  In turn, critics of the distortionist thesis, beginning with [[Daniel Kevles]], deny that the military "seduced American physicists from, so to speak, a 'true basic physics'."&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, Daniel J.  "Cold war and hot physics: Science, security, and the American state, 1945-56," ''Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences'', Vol. 20, No. 2, pp 239-264.  1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kevles, as well as Geiger, instead view the effects of military funding relative to such funding simply being absent—rather than put to alternate scientific use.&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, “Science, Universities, and National Defense, 1945-1970.”  See also: Geiger, Roger.  ''Knowledge &amp; Money: Research Universities and the Paradox of the Marketplace''.  Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2004.
In Geiger’s broad analysis of the relationship between political economy and academic research, the character and purpose of funding sources play little role, and there is no discussion of the distinctiveness of military funding.  Rather, such funding is significant only in the context of ‘[[crowding out (economics)|crowding out]]’ other economic forces.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most recent scholarship has moved toward a tempered version of Forman's thesis, in which scientists retained significant autonomy despite the radical changes brought about by military funding.&lt;ref&gt;Hounshell, David A.  "Epilogue: Rethinking the Cold War; Rethinking Science and Technology in the Cold War; Rethinking the Social Study of Science and Technology," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 31, No. 2, April 2001, pp 289-297.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Music publishing''' is the business of creating, producing and distributing printed musical scores, parts, and books in various types of [[music notation]], while ensuring that the [[composer]], [[songwriter]] and other creators receive credit and [[royalties]] or other payment (where applicable). This article outlines the early history of the industry.

==Printing==
Music publishing did not begin on a large scale until the mid-15th century, when mechanical techniques for printing music were first developed. The earliest example, a set of [[liturgical chant]]s, dates from about 1465, shortly after the [[Gutenberg Bible]]. Prior to this time, music had to be copied out by hand. This was a very [[labor-intensive]] and time-consuming process, so it was usually undertaken only by monks and priests seeking to preserve [[sacred music]] for the church. The few collections of [[secular music]] that are extant were commissioned and owned by wealthy noblemen. Examples include the [[Squarcialupi Codex]] of Italian [[Trecento]] music and the [[Chantilly Codex]] of French [[Ars subtilior]] music.

===Petrucci===
The father of modern music printing was [[Ottaviano Petrucci]], a printer and publisher who was able to secure a twenty-year [[monopoly]] on printed music in [[Venice]] during the 16th century. His first collection was entitled ''[[Harmonice Musices Odhecaton]]'' and contained 96 [[polyphony|polyphonic]] compositions, mostly by [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Heinrich Isaac]]. He flourished by focusing on [[Flemish]] works, rather than Italian, as they were very popular throughout Europe during the Renaissance. His printing shop used the triple-impression method, in which a sheet of paper was pressed three times. The first impression was the staff lines, the second the words, and the third the notes. This method produced very clean results, though it was time-consuming and expensive.

===Rastell===
Around 1520 in England, [[John Rastell]] developed a single-impression method for printing music.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Bernstein, ''Music Printing in Renaissance Venice: The Scotto Press, 1539-1572'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; With his method, the staff lines, words and notes were all part of a single piece of type, making it much easier to produce. However, this method produced messier results, as the staff lines were often inexactly aligned and looked wavy on the page. The single-impression method eventually triumphed over Petrucci's, however, and became the dominant mode of printing until [[copper-plate engraving]] took over in the 17th century. This method was adopted and used widely by a Frenchman, [[Pierre Attaingnant]].

==Copyright==
[[File:Statute of anne.jpg|thumb|150px|First page from the "Statute of Anne"]]

The concept of musical copyright had its beginnings in the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] of England who required copies of all printed matter to be sent to him and offered protection to printers in the form of licenses, primarily to produce a new source of revenue. In 1575 [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] granted [[Thomas Tallis]] and his pupil [[William Byrd]] a 21-year patent monopoly on the printing and publishing of polyphonic music.&lt;ref name="Wainright2006"&gt;J. P. Wainright, 'England ii, 1603-1642' in J. Haar, ed., ''European Music, 1520-1640'' (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2006), pp. 509-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern copyright law was the [[Statute of Anne]] (1709), which protected all published works for a period of fourteen years, later extended to twenty-eight years. The earliest attempt at a printed musical [[copyright notice]] appears in the [[Song of Songs|"Shir Hashirim"]] of [[Salomone Rossi]] (Venice, 1623) which includes a [[rabbinical]] curse on those [[Copyright infringement|infringing]] the text, written by [[Leon of Modena]].

===1886 Berne Convention===
The first international agreement involving copyright was the [[Berne Convention]] of 1886. The core principle of the Convention is its provision that each of the contracting countries shall provide automatic protection for works in all other countries of the union and for unpublished works whose authors are citizens of or residents in those countries. Performance rights are included in these provisions.  As of March 2012, 165 countries had become parties to the convention.

===United States===
The first U.S. [[Copyright Act of 1790|federal copyright law]] gave protections to "maps, charts, and books." Contrary to some scholarly accounts, the 1790 Act's protection of "books" did encompass musical compositions.&lt;ref&gt;''Clayton v. Stone'', 5 F. Cas. 999, 1000 (C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1829) (“A book [within the Copyright Act of 1790 can be] a volume made up of several sheets bound together; it may be printed only on one sheet, as the words of a song or the music accompanying it”)&lt;/ref&gt; The first registration in the U.S. for a musical composition was made on January 6, 1794 by [[Raynor Taylor]] for the original song "[[The Kentucky Volunteer]]."&lt;ref&gt;William F. Patry, Copyright Law and Practice 30 n.91 (2000) (“The first registration for a musical composition was made on January 6, 1794, for The Kentucky Volunteer: A New Song, written by ‘a lady of Philadelphia.’ The composer is believed to have been Raynor Taylor.”) (citing Federal Copyright Records 1790-1800 at 15 (1987)).&lt;/ref&gt; However, musical compositions were not ''explicitly'' protected until the [[Copyright Act of 1831]], and then protection remained limited to reproduction rights. The copyright term was twenty-eight years plus a fourteen-year renewal period.

==Performing rights==
[[File:Rue Chaptal, 10.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Façade of 10 Rue Chaptal, first home of SACEM]]
While England was a leader in the development of copyright, the French led the way in performing rights. In 1777, [[Pierre de Beaumarchais]] founded the ''"Bureau de Legislation Dramatique"'' which became the present [[Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques]] (SACD) in 1829. Many years later, in 1847, this inspired the composer and [[librettist]] [[Ernest Bourget]]  to claim payment for each performance of his works at [[Les Ambassadeurs (restaurant)|Les Ambassadeurs]], a leading Café-concert venue of that time. A [[lawsuit]] won by Bourget and others in 1851 led to the formation of the [[Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique|Société des Auteurs, Compositeurs et Editeurs de Musique]] (SACEM) – the first performing rights society in the world.

Other countries followed suit: The Italian [[Società Italiana degli Autori ed Editori]] (SIAE) was founded in 1882 and the Spanish ''"Sociedad de Autores"'', predecessor of the current [[Sociedad General de Autores y Editores]] (SGAE), in 1899. The predecessor to the [[Gesellschaft für musikalische Aufführungs- und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte|Gesellschaft für Musikalische Aufführungs und Mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte]] (GEMA) was formed in Germany by composer [[Richard Strauss]] in 1903. It became GEMA in 1915 when it merged with another small society. So, by the end of the 19th century, the foundation had been laid for the modern music publishing industry.

==Early modern era: 18th century==

===German publishers===
As England was a leader in developing copyright systems and France was ahead in developing performing rights, Germany was the pioneering country in modern music publishing. The first German music publishing enterprises date from the 18th century. [[Bernhard Christoph Breitkopf]] of [[Leipzig]], a printer and general publisher, decided to specialize in music printing as of 1754.  He became successful by developing improvements in the setting of music type. [[Gottfried Christoph Härtel]] joined the firm in 1795, which soon became the partnership of '''[[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]]'''. They were the original publishers for a who's-who of great German composers, including [[Beethoven]], [[Haydn]], [[Mozart]], [[Schubert]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] and [[Wagner]].

'''[[Schott Music]]''' of [[Mainz]] was founded in 1770 by [[Bernhard Schott]] and still exists today.  They specialized in French and Italian operas and, more recently, have published works by [[Hindemith]], [[Stravinsky]], [[Carl Orff|Orff]], [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] and [[Hans Werner Henze|Henze]]. '''[[N. Simrock]]''' of [[Bonn]], and later Berlin, was established in 1790 by [[Nikolaus Simrock]].  Their original publications included works by Beethoven, Haydn, [[Meyerbeer]], [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], Schumann and [[Brahms]].

===United States of America===
In 1764, [[Josiah Flagg]] compiled the first collection of popular and religious music, printed on paper made in the colonies.  The post-revolutionary period was notable for the arrival of the first professional music publishers from Europe in the 1770s. They opened shops in [[Philadelphia]], New York, [[Boston]] and [[Baltimore]], bringing with them European technology. [[Benjamin Carr]] and [[James Hewitt (musician)|James Hewitt]] were two important early American music publishers. The first song published under US copyright was [[The Kentucky Volunteer]], by Carr's own house.

In the first quarter of the 19th century alone, 10,000 pieces of popular music were printed by U.S. publishers. The industry, however, did nothing to promote music or develop writers. Songs became popular by word-of-mouth. Most [[Minstrel show|minstrel troupe]]s and professional singers wrote their own music or had songs written to order. [[Stephen Foster]] was the first composer who tried to make a living as an independent professional songwriter but, in the 1850s, copyright protection was so lax and royalties so small (or non-existent) that he found himself living in poverty. This changed only gradually as young men involved in other business enterprises began to perceive the possibilities for enrichment in song publishing.
[[File:AftertheBallSheet.jpg|thumb|150px|Sheet music for "After the Ball"]]
Prior to the 1880s, popular music publishing was a secondary function of music stores or "serious" ([[Classical music|Classical]]) music publishers. After 1880, publishers in New York developed a promotional technique called [[Song-plugger|plugging]].  By 1900, most music publishers had clustered their businesses along 28th St. (between [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|6th Ave.]] and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]) in order to be closer to New York's thriving entertainment center. This area came to be known as [[Tin Pan Alley]]. The first decade of the 20th century saw the production of more popular music than had ever been written up to that time: about 25,000 songs annually. In 1893, sheet music for the song [[After the Ball (song)|"After the Ball"]] sold one million copies and, over the next ten years, went on to sell a total of ten million.

Despite the enactment of new U.S. copyright legislation, including the 1891 [[Chace Act]], which allowed for the international protection of copyrights, the provisions of the [[1909 Copyright Act]] were generally ignored. To correct this situation, operetta composer [[Victor Herbert]] established the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP), in 1914. It quickly attracted prominent composers such as [[Irving Berlin]] and [[John Philip Sousa]], and was able to ensure that everyone was properly paid and credited for their work.

== Licensing ==

There are many aspects to music publishing. Chief among them is the licensing of music for use in advertising, television, films and other purposes. Music publishing started out by just being the publishing of the actual sheet music, and not even the score. Song sheets were made which just had the lyrics of a popular song. In the 19th century, sheet music for songs began including a simple piano [[accompaniment]] and notation for the song's melody. In the 2010s, music publishing is the exploitation of compositions (songs, instrumental pieces, and other music) for various performance uses, including newer uses such as licensing for video games, for use by recording artists looking for their next hit single and for use in a range of licensing purposes.

===Licenses===

Within music publishing there are many different types of licenses. For instance:

• Blanket license

• Mechanical license

• Performing Rights License (PRO)

• [[Synchronization rights|Synchronization License or Sync Rights]]

A blanket license is a big annual fee to one of the key performing rights organizations (PRO) ([[SESAC]], [[ASCAP]], or [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]]). The blanket license paid to the PRO, covers every work that is in the PRO's catalog. Blanket licenses are mostly used by television networks and radio stations so that they have the right to play any song or piece from one catalog instead of paying license fees for every single song.&lt;ref name="Mark Halloran 2007"&gt;Mark Halloran, ''Musician's Business &amp; Legal Guide (4th Edition)'' (Prentice Hall, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

A mechanical license is issued when a recording artist wishes to sell their recording of a written composition.  It serves as a notice to the composition owners that sales are forthcoming and that royalties dictated by a statutory rate will be owed and paid to them.

[[Performing Rights]] License (PRO) is the license that gives the licensee the right to publicly perform the song/work that they get the license to anywhere.&lt;ref name="Mark Halloran 2007"/&gt;

Lastly, a sync license grants the right to use the composition in the synchronization of a recording over a moving picture in a film, advertisement, television show or any other audiovisual work.  For the same synchronization use, one must also obtain a master use license, which grants rights to use the sound recording, which is a separately owned asset from the composition.

A [[music publisher (popular music)|music publisher]] does a lot to negotiate the uses and fees for the songwriters and composers on their roster. In the 2010s, the publishing companies are a main source of revenue besides live touring, because sync licensing has persisted as a substantial income source while the music industry underwent wrenching changes that saw their previously dominant income source, record sales, steadily decline.

==Technologies==

===Sound recording===
The invention and development of [[sound recording]] resulted in a redefinition of the concept of publishing, much the same as [[online music store]]s in the 2000s would later revolutionize how recordings are purchased. Initially, popular music was slow to take advantage of the new technology. In 1910, when sales of the new disc format exceeded those of the old cylinder, more than 75% of the records sold were classical music. One factor in this may have been the expense, which would have concentrated sales among the more upscale purchasers. Until 1925, sheet music sales continued to surpass discs and were the primary source of revenue for publishers and composers. At that point, sheet music sales began to decline while records were still providing inadequate income to compensate. This led to short lived but serious economic problems for some publishers.

===Film music===
[[Samuel Fox (1884-1971)]] who founded the [[Sam Fox Publishing Company]] in 1906, was the first to publish original film scores.&lt;ref name = "film scores"&gt;"Music Publisher Sam Fox Dies at 89"; Associated Press, ''Daily Mail'', Hagerstown, Maryland; Dec. 4, 1971; pg 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, after the release of ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (the first [[talkie]]), the need for music led movie studios to buy music publishing companies, gaining both catalogues of music and experienced composers at the same time. For example, in 1929, [[Warner Brothers]] paid 10 million dollars for [[T.B. Harms &amp; Francis, Day &amp; Hunter, Inc.|Harms]], [[M. Witmark &amp; Sons|Witmark]] and [[Jerome H. Remick|Remick]]; [[MGM]] bought [[Leo Feist Inc.]] and some smaller companies; [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] started its own publishing division, [[Famous Music]].

'''Hydrometeorology''' is a branch of [[meteorology]] and [[hydrology]] that studies the transfer of [[water]] and [[energy]] between the land surface and the lower [[atmosphere]]. [[Hydrology|Hydrologists]] often utilize [[meteorologists]] and products produced by meteorologists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peck|first=Eugene L.|date=1978|title=Hydrometeorology|url=https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0477-59.5.609|journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society|volume=59(5)|pages=609-612|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, a meteorologist would forecast 2-3 inches of rain is a specific area, and a hydrologist would then forecast what the specific impact of that rain would be on the terrain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hydrometeorology: Forecasting and Applications|last=Sene|first=Kevin|publisher=Springer International Publishing Switzerland|year=2015|isbn=978-3-319-23546-2|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] has several programmes and activities in place that deal with the study of [[natural hazards]] of hydrometeorological origin and the mitigation of their effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/special-themes/disaster-risk-reduction/natural-hazards/hydro-meteorological-hazards/|title=Hydro-meteorological hazards &amp;#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|date=|publisher=Unesco.org|accessdate=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these hazards are the results of natural processes or [[Atmosphere|atmospheric]], [[Hydrology|hydrological]], or [[oceanographic]] phenomena such as [[flood]]s, [[tropical cyclone]]s, [[drought]] and [[desertification]]. Many countries have established an operational hydrometeorological capability to assist with [[weather forecasting|forecasting]], warning, and informing the public of these developing hazards.

== Hydrometeorological Forecasting ==
One of the more significant aspects of hydrometeorology has to do with the prediction and attempt to mitigate the effects of high precipitation events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dale|first=Murray|last2=Davies|first2=Paul|last3=Harrison|first3=Tim|date=2012|title=Review of recent advances in UK operational hydrometeorology|url=https://doi.org/10.1680/wama.2012.165.2.55|journal=Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers : Water management|volume=165|pages=55-64|doi=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the prediction, there are three primary ways to to model when coming to forecasting. These are now-casting, numerical weather prediction, and statistical techniques.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Nowcasting (meteorology)|Now-casting]] is good for predicting events for a few hours out, utilizing observations and live radar data to combine with the numerical weather prediction models.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Numerical weather prediction]], which is the primary technique used to forecast weather, uses models to take account of the atmosphere, ocean models, and accounts for many other variables when it produces forecasts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These forecasts are generally used for predictions days or weeks out.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Finally, statistical techniques utilize regressions and other statistical methods to create long-term projections that go out weeks and months at a time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These models allow scientists to view how a multitude of different variables interact with one another, and they illustrate one picture in how earth's climate interacts with itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Betts|first=Alan|date=2004|title=Understanding Hydrometeorology Using Global Models|url=https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-85-11-1673|journal=American Meteorological Society|volume=|pages=1673-1688|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risk Assessment ==
A major component of hydrometeorology is mitigating the risk associated with flooding and other hydrological threats. First, there has to be knowledge of the possible hydrological threats that are expected within a specific region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After analyzing the possible threats, warning systems are put in place to quickly alert people and communicate to them the identity and magnitude of the threat.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many nations have their own specific regional hydrometeorological centers that communicate threats to the public. Finally, there has to be proper response protocols in place to protect the public during a dangerous event.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2118">{{Main article|Pollination syndrome}}

'''Hydrophily''' is a fairly uncommon form of [[pollination]] whereby [[pollen]] is distributed by the flow of [[water]]s, particularly in [[river]]s and [[stream]]s. Hydrophilous species fall into two categories: 
(i) Those that distribute their pollen to the surface of water. e.g. ''Vallisneria'''s male flower or pollen grain are released on the surface of water, which are passively carried away by water currents; some of them eventually reach the female flower
(ii) Those that distribute it beneath the surface. e.g. seagrasses in which female flower remain submergered in water and pollen grains are released inside the water.

==Surface pollination==
Surface pollination is more frequent,&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appears to be a transitional phase between [[anemophily|wind pollination]] and true hydrophily. In these the pollen floats on the surface and reaches the stigmas of the female flowers as in ''[[Hydrilla]]'', ''[[Callitriche]]'', ''[[Ruppia]]'', ''[[Zostera]]'', ''[[Elodea]]''. In ''[[Vallisneria]]'' the male flowers become detached and float on the surface of the water; the anthers are thus brought in contact with the stigmas of the female flowers.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt; Surface hydrophily has been observed in several species of ''[[Potamogeton]]'' as well as some marine species.

==Submerged pollination==
Species exhibiting true submerged hydrophily include ''[[Najas]]'', where the pollen grains are heavier than water, and sinking down are caught by the stigmas of the extremely simple female flowers,&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt; ''[[Posidonia australis]]'' and ''[[Zostera marina]]''.{{sfn|Cox|1988|pp=261–279}}

An '''innuendo''' is a [[wikt:hint|hint]], [[wikt:insinuation|insinuation]] or [[wikt:intimation|intimation]] about a person or thing, especially of a denigrating or a derogatory nature. It can also be a remark or question, typically disparaging  (also called '''insinuation'''), that works obliquely by [[allusion]]. In the latter sense the intention is often to [[insult]] or accuse someone in such a way that one's words, taken literally, are innocent.

According to the ''[[Advanced Oxford Learner's Dictionary]]'', an innuendo is "an indirect remark about somebody or something, usually suggesting something bad, mean or rude", such as:'' "innuendos about her private life" ''or'' "The song is full of sexual innuendo".''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/innuendo?q=innuendo ''Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518094326/http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/innuendo?q=innuendo |date=2015-05-18 }} (7th Edition; electronic version)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''sexual innuendo''' has acquired a specific meaning, namely that of a "risqué" [[double entendre]] by playing on a possibly sexual interpretation of an otherwise innocent uttering. For example: "We need to go deeper" can be seen as either a request for further inquiry, or a request to go deeper into an [[intimate part]].

In the context of [[Defamation|defamation law]], an innuendo meaning is one which is not directly contained in the words complained of, but which would be understood by those reading it based on special knowledge.

==Film, television and other media==
Comedy film scripts have used innuendo since the beginning of sound film itself. A notable example is the ''[[Carry On (franchise)|Carry On]]'' film series (1958–1992) in which innuendo was a staple feature, often including the title of the film itself. [[British sitcoms]] and comedy shows such as ''[[Are You Being Served?]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/264230.stm|title=Going down: 'Grace Bros' store closes|publisher=BBC News|date=February 1, 1999|quote=The innuendo was loud and clear|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227013009/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/264230.stm|archivedate=February 27, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Round the Horne]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3605608/A-return-to-unalloyed-joy.html|title=A return to unalloyed joy|author=Dominic Cavendish|date=31 Oct 2003|publisher=''The Daily Telegraph''|quote=...a censor-baiting mixture of absurd spoofs, yarns, links and character-turns, laced with end-of-the-pier innuendo and erudite-infantile wordplay.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924212749/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3605608/A-return-to-unalloyed-joy.html|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also made extensive use of innuendo. Mild sexual innuendo is a staple of British [[pantomime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/12/25/144248303/only-the-brits-not-christmas-without-pantomime|title=Only The Brits: Not Christmas Without Pantomime|publisher=NPR|date=December 25, 2011|quote=No panto is complete without a dose of smutty innuendo for the adults and some contemporary political jokes.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101101932/http://www.npr.org/2011/12/25/144248303/only-the-brits-not-christmas-without-pantomime|archivedate=January 1, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Animal Flyer.jpg|thumb|A male cat paying a "call" on a female cat, who then serves up kittens, insinuating that the "result" of children is predicated on a male "catcall"]]

Numerous television programs targeted at child audiences often use innuendos in attempt to entertain adolescent/adult audiences without exceeding their network's censorship policies.

Many American primetime shows use an extensive amount of innuendo to the point that it is rated TV-PG/14 D for dialogue.{{fact|date=January 2012}} Also, many radio shows, are notable for this.{{fact|date=January 2012}}

On ''[[The Scott Mills Show]]'' on [[BBC Radio 1]], listeners are asked to send in clips from radio and TV with innuendos in a humorous context, a feature known as "Innuendo Bingo". Presenters and special guests fill their mouths with water and listen to the clips, and the last person to spit the water out with laughter wins the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innuendo Bingo|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00hq228|accessdate=15 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102185555/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00hq228|archivedate=2 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The projects under this theme are funder by the [[Ministry of Agriculture (India)|Ministry of Agriculture]], Government of India. The efforts are focussed on sustainable agricultural development with special attention on [[environmental economics]]. The studies revolve around the pattern of growth in agriculture, its sources, determinants and implications in the society and the non farm employment in rural and urban India. The researches have produced several books, journals and research papers which are available for reference with IEG library.

===Environmental and natural resources===

The theme was introduced for research in the Eighties and has gained importance over the time. Research activities on non-renewable resources such as coal, iron ore, petroleum and oil, irrigation and water management, solar, biogas and renewable energy technologies have gained momentum at the Institute. Simultaneously, forest related issues and industrial pollution are also treated as high priority subjects.

===Globalization and trade===

The principal are of work under this theme was [[transfer of technology]] and multinational enterprises which has now been expanded to cover trade and emerging issues of [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) as well. The issues emerged as a fallout of [[globalization]] such as social and economic impact and cross-border trade have also been included now for further study.

===Health economics and policy===

The theme focusses on areas of [[health economics]] in the evolving national scene and is aimed at assisting policy makers with valid research data for arriving at policies and its amendments from time to time.

===Industry and development===

The theme of Industry and development was a major one, introduced at the beginning of the Institute and covered the entire range from small industry to multinational corporations with emphasis on employment, efficiency, environment and information technology. The emphasis is on contemporary issues from a policy making perspective. Small scale industries, petroleum, cotton and jute textiles, pricing policy for cement, sugar and cotton, location of sugar and fertilizer factories, and wages and productivity in major industries have all been taken up for advanced research and resultant studies have been made available to policy makers during the past years.

===Employment, labour and informal sector===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="136054">{{hatnote|This is a mostly complete list of the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, according to the sixth edition of the Köchel catalogue. For a selective list of his works, grouped by genre, see [[List of compositions by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].}}

The '''Köchel catalogue''' ({{lang-de|Köchel-Verzeichnis}}) is a [[Chronology|chronological]] catalogue of compositions by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], originally created by [[Ludwig Ritter von Köchel|Ludwig von Köchel]], in which the entries are abbreviated ''K.'' and ''KV''. The numbers of the Köchel catalogue reflect the continuing establishment of a complete chronology of Mozart's works, and provide a shorthand reference to the compositions.

According to Köchel's counting, ''[[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem in D minor]]'' is the 626th piece Mozart composed, thus is designated either ''K.&amp;nbsp;626'' or ''KV&amp;nbsp;626''; however, his original catalogue (1862) of Mozart has been twice revised, and some works have had three KV. numbers, e.g. Mozart's [[Horn Concerto No. 1 (Mozart)|Horn Concerto No. 1, K.&amp;nbsp;(412+514)/386b]].

==History==
In the decades after Mozart's death there were several attempts to catalogue his compositions, for example by [[Franz Gleißner]] and [[Johann Anton André]] (published in 1833), but it was not until 1862 that Ludwig von Köchel succeeded in producing a comprehensive listing. Köchel's 551-page catalogue was titled ''Chronologisch-thematisches Verzeichnis sämm&lt;!-- not a typo --&gt;tlicher Tonwerke W. A. Mozarts'' (''Chronological-thematic Catalogue of the Complete Musical Works of W. A. Mozart'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]] |last=Köchel |first=Ludwig Ritter von |authorlink=Ludwig Ritter von Köchel |title=Chronologisch-thematisches Verzeichniss sämmtlicher Tonwerke Wolfgang Amade Mozart's |location=Leipzig |year=1862 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kV4VAAAAYAAJ |oclc=3309798 |archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/chronologischth01kcgoog |archivedate=12 February 2008 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Köchel attempted to arrange the works in chronological order, but many compositions written before 1784 could only be estimated, although [[Leopold Mozart]] had compiled a partial list of his son's earlier works; Mozart's catalogue of his own compositions (begun in February 1784 with [[K. 449]]) allows relatively precise dating of many of his later works.  The catalogue included the opening bars of each piece, known as an [[incipit]]. Köchel divided the corpus into a main chronology of 626 works, and five appendices (''{{linktext|Anhang}}'' in German, abbreviated to ''Anh.'') The appendices (Anh. I-V) included:
*I – Lost authentic works
*II – Fragments by Mozart
*III – Works by Mozart transcribed by others
*IV – Doubtful works
*V – Misattributed works

Since Köchel published his original catalogue in 1863 (now referred to as K{{sup|1}}), the dating of Mozart's compositions has been subject to constant revision. Many more pieces have since been found, re-dated, re-attributed and re-numbered, requiring three revised editions of the catalogue. Subsequent editions – especially the third edition (K{{sup|3}}) by [[Alfred Einstein]] (1937), and the sixth edition (K{{sup|6}}) by [[Franz Giegling]], [[:de:Gerd Sievers|Gerd Sievers]], and [[Alexander Weinmann]] (1964) – have reflected attempts to arrange the growing list of works in a more accurate chronological order, according to various levels of scholarship.

A major shortcoming of K{{sup|1}} was that there was no room to expand the strictly sequential numbering in the main catalogue to allow for any new discoveries or further reassessment of existing works. For the 1937 edition (K{{sup|3}}) Einstein (following the analyses of [[Téodor de Wyzewa|Théodore de Wyzewa]] and Georges de St. Foix) reassigned a number of works from the original K{{sup|1}} appendices into the main catalogue by interpolating new numbers into the main sequence with a lower-case letter suffix. In K{{sup|6}} some of these were reassessed in the light of scholarship since 1937 and returned to the re-worked appendices:
* K. 626a
** K. 626a I – 64 cadenzas by Mozart to his own keyboard concertos
** K. 626a II – Cadenzas by Mozart to keyboard concertos by other composers
* K. 626b – 42 sketches &amp; other fragments by Mozart (replacing K{{sup|3}} Anh. II)
* Anh. A – Copies by Mozart of other composers' works 
* Anh. B – Works by Mozart transcribed by others
* Anh. C – Doubtful and misattributed vocal (C.1–10) and instrumental (C.11-30) works

For example, the Divertimento for Wind Octet in E♭ was numbered Anh.&amp;nbsp;226 in K{{sup|1}}; Einstein placed it in the K{{sup|3}} main catalogue as K.&amp;nbsp;196e, between K.&amp;nbsp;196 and K.&amp;nbsp;197; K{{sup|6}} reassigned it again to the 'doubtful' appendix C as Anh. C 17.01. Some works in Anh. A have been identified since 1965 as by Leopold Mozart. Many works in Anh. C have since been more reliably assigned to other composers, or to Mozart himself.

==List of existing Mozart compositions==
To maintain as much of the original K-numbering of the list as possible, while re-ordering in the revised, chronological sequence, letters were added to the new numbers. The following list shows Köchel's original designation (K{{sup|1}}) and the sixth edition (K{{sup|6}}). Other addenda and supplements to the catalogue are marked ''{{linktext|Anhang}}.'' (This has been abbreviated to 'Anh.' in the list below.)  Works listed as composed for piano were most likely performed on harpsichord or piano (more properly, forte-piano), as the harpsichord was still current in Mozart's day.

'''La Casa de la Ciencia''' (''the House of Science'') in the city of [[Seville]], Spain is a centre for popularizing science.

Along with a museum, the building houses the Andalusian headquarters of the Spanish National Research Council ([[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]]). CSIC is the largest public institution devoted to research in Spain, and the third largest in Europe. The building was opened to the public in 2008, with the goal of sharing knowledge acquired through scientific research. La Casa de la Ciencia aims to be a bridge between the scientific research community and the public, sharing contemporary scientific research and information on environmental issues.
The museum achieves these goals by putting on various types of events, including exhibitions, conferences, seminars and workshops.
The museum contains three permanent exhibits, one temporary exhibit and a planetarium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==

The museum is housed in the Peruvian pavilion (''Pabellón de Perú''), a building of great beauty that was built in the [[Maria Luisa Park]] for the [[Ibero-American Exposition of 1929]]. In addition to being home to the offices of the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas en Sevilla ([[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]]), the building also house the Peruvian Consulate.&lt;ref name="consuladoperusevilla.es"&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.consuladoperusevilla.es/
 |publisher=Consulado General del Perú en Sevilla
 |title=Consulado General del Perú en Sevilla
 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
For twenty years the building was the headquarters of the Biological Station of Doñana and in April 2008 the city council of Seville provided a grant to renovate the building to create La Casa de la Ciencia.  In April 2008 the city council of Seville provided a grant to renovate the building to create La Casa de la Cienca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==

[[File:Pabellón Perú.jpg|thumb|right| Museum interior]]

The building was designed by the renowned architect Manuel Piqueras Cotolí (1885 – 1937). Cotoli was born in Lucena, Córdoba but moved to Peru to study and became known for his buildings which blended indigenous and colonial architecture. These buildings include the [[Escuela Nacional Superior Autónoma de Bellas Artes]], Pizarro´s Tomb in the [[Cathedral of Lima]], and the Archbishop's Palace. The blending of architectural styles is easily visible from the outside of La Casa de la Ciencia, and many parts of the building share similarities with Cotoli’s Peruvian works.

A part of the building holds the Consulate General of Peru in Seville.&lt;ref name="consuladoperusevilla.es"/&gt;
In July 2008 the Peruvian ambassador to Spain signed a 75-year renewal of the assignment by the City of Seville of the Pavilion of Peru to the Republic of Peru and to the CSIC. The CSIC had undertaken to provide a {{convert|3000|m2|sqft}} exhibition space open to the public dedicated to the extension of science in [[Andalusia]].

==Exterior==

The building lies on the Avenida Maria Luisa, noted for the [[Queen's sewing box]] (''Costurero de la Reina''), a unique building that takes the form of a small hexagonal castle with turrets at the corners, and the oldest building in Seville in the ''neomudéjar'' style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=Costurero de la Reina de Sevilla, España
 |work=Fotografías de Sevilla, España
 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is between the [[Seville Public Library]], inaugurated in 1999 by the [[Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo]], and the ''[[Teatro Lope de Vega Sevilla]]'', a small baroque-style theatre that was also built for the exhibition.&lt;ref name=visitarq&gt;{{cite web

On one side of the building is the [[Guadalquivir]] river and on the other, [[Parque Maria Luisa]] and [[Plaza de España (Seville)]].

==Features==

[[File:Whale in entrance of Science Museum, Seville.JPG|thumb|right|Whale hanging in the entrance to the museum - Science Museum, Seville]]

The museum currently has three permanent exhibits open to the public, which showcase the [[flora]], [[fauna]] and [[minerals]] of the region: ''Invertebrates of Andalusia'', ''Geology of Seville'', and ''A Sea of Cetaceans in Andalusia''. The museum also contains Seville's only [[planetarium]].
 
Notable features include a clepsydra ([[Water clock]]) and an [[ecosphere (aquarium)]]. 
[[Peter O'Toole]]'s opening scene in [[Lawrence of Arabia]] was filmed in basement of the building, now used for meetings by [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]].

'''Learning''' is the process of acquiring new, or modifying existing, [[knowledge]], [[behavior]]s, [[skill]]s, [[value (personal and cultural)|value]]s, or [[preference]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gross, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cle1Fcr_6_QC&amp;pg=PT335 Psychology: The Science of Mind and Behaviour] 6E, Hachette UK, {{ISBN|9781444164367}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to learn is possessed by humans, animals, and some [[machine learning|machines]]; there is also evidence for some kind of learning in some plants.&lt;ref&gt;Karban, R. (2015). Plant Learning and Memory. In: ''Plant Sensing and Communication''. Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, pp. 31-44, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8HOeCQAAQBAJ].&lt;/ref&gt; Some learning is immediate, induced by a single event (e.g. being burned by a hot stove), but much skill and knowledge accumulates from repeated experiences. The changes induced by learning often last a lifetime, and it is hard to distinguish learned material that seems to be "lost" from that which cannot be retrieved.&lt;ref name="Schacter"&gt;{{cite book | title=Psychology, 2nd edition | publisher=Worth Publishers |author1=Daniel L. Schacter |author2=Daniel T. Gilbert |author3=Daniel M. Wegner | origyear=2009| year=2011 | pages=264 | isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human learning begins before birth and continues until death as a consequence of ongoing interactions between person and environment. The nature and processes involved in learning are studied in many fields, including [[educational psychology]], [[neuropsychology]], [[experimental psychology]], and [[pedagogy]]. Research in such fields has led to the identification of various sorts of learning. For example, learning may occur as a result of [[habituation]], or [[classical conditioning]], [[operant conditioning]] or as a result of more complex activities such as [[play (activity)|play]], seen only in relatively intelligent animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/1996/1/junglegyms.cfm Jungle Gyms: The Evolution of Animal Play] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011051238/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/1996/1/junglegyms.cfm |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecephalopodpage.org/behavior.php|title=What behavior can we expect of octopuses? - The Cephalopod Page|author=|date=|website=www.thecephalopodpage.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005135515/http://www.thecephalopodpage.org/behavior.php|archivedate=5 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning may occur [[conscious]]ly or without conscious awareness. Learning that an aversive event can't be avoided nor escaped may result in a condition called [[learned helplessness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|1380861|Learned helplessness}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence for human behavioral learning [[prenatal]]ly, in which [[habituation]] has been observed as early as 32 weeks into [[gestation]], indicating that the [[central nervous system]] is sufficiently developed and primed for learning and [[memory]] to occur very early on in [[developmental psychology|development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sandman | first1 = Wadhwa | last2 = Hetrick | first2 = Porto | last3 = Peeke | year = 1997 | title = Human fetal heart rate dishabituation between thirty and thirty-two weeks gestation | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 68 | issue = 6| pages = 1031–1040 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1997.tb01982.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Play has been approached by several theorists as the first form of learning. Children experiment with the world, learn the rules, and learn to interact through play. [[Lev Vygotsky]] agrees that play is pivotal for children's development, since they make meaning of their environment through playing educational games.

=== Non-associative learning ===
''Non-associative learning'' refers to "a relatively permanent change in the strength of response to a single stimulus due to repeated exposure to that stimulus. Changes due to such factors as [[sensory adaptation]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], or injury do not qualify as non-associative learning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ipfw.edu/abbott/314/Non-associativeLearning.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103191805/http://users.ipfw.edu/abbott/314/Non-associativeLearning.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-associative learning can be divided into [[habituation]] and [[sensitization]].

==== Habituation ====
{{Main|Habituation}}
''Habituation'' is an example of non-associative learning in which the strength or probability of a response diminishes when the stimulus is repeated. The response is typically a reflex or unconditioned response. Thus, habituation must be distinguished from [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]], which is an associative process. In operant extinction, for example, a response declines because it is no longer followed by a reward. An example of habituation can be seen in small song birds—if a stuffed [[owl]] (or similar [[predator]]) is put into the cage, the birds initially react to it as though it were a real predator. Soon the birds react less, showing habituation. If another stuffed owl is introduced (or the same one removed and re-introduced), the birds react to it again as though it were a predator, demonstrating that it is only a very specific stimulus that is habituated to (namely, one particular unmoving owl in one place). The habituation process is faster for stimuli that occur at a high rather than for stimuli that occur at a low rate as well as for the weak and strong stimuli, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Science of Learning|last=Pear|first=Joseph|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2014|isbn=9781317762805|location=London|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Habituation has been shown in essentially every species of animal, as well as the sensitive plant ''[[Mimosa pudica]]''&lt;ref name="gagliano2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gagliano | first1 = M. | display-authors = etal | year = 2014 | title = Experience teaches plants to learn faster and forget slower in environments where it matters | url = | journal = Oecologia | volume = 175 | issue = 1| pages = 63–72 | doi=10.1007/s00442-013-2873-7| pmid = 24390479 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the large protozoan ''[[Stentor coeruleus]]''.&lt;ref name="wood1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = D.C. | year = 1988 | title = Habituation in ''Stentor'' produced by mechanoreceptor channel modification | url = | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 2254 | issue = | page = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept acts in direct opposition to sensitization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Sensitization ====
{{Main|Sensitization}}
''Sensitization'' is an example of non-associative learning in which the progressive amplification of a response follows repeated administrations of a [[stimulation|stimulus]] (Bell et al., 1995).{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} This is based on the notion that a defensive reflex to a stimulus such as withdrawal or escape becomes stronger after the exposure to a different harmful or threatening stimulus.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neurosciences - From Molecule to Behavior: a university textbook|last=Galizia|first=Giovanni|last2=Lledo|first2=Pierre-Marie|publisher=Springer Spektrum|year=2013|isbn=9783642107689|location=Heidelberg|pages=578}}&lt;/ref&gt; An everyday example of this mechanism is the repeated tonic stimulation of peripheral nerves that occurs if a person rubs their arm continuously. After a while, this stimulation creates a warm sensation that eventually turns painful. The pain results from the progressively amplified synaptic response of the peripheral nerves warning that the stimulation is harmful.{{clarify|date=January 2011}} Sensitisation is thought to underlie both adaptive as well as maladaptive learning processes in the organism.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

=== Active learning ===
{{main|Active learning}}

[[File:Learning_Retention_Pyramid.JPG|thumb|[[Experiential learning]] is more efficient than passive learning like reading or listening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/kokcharov-skillpyramid2015|title=Hierarchy of Skills|first=|last=Igor Kokcharov, Ph.D, PMP|date=22 May 2015|website=slideshare.net|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161217164955/http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/kokcharov-skillpyramid2015|archivedate=17 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

''Active learning'' occurs when a person takes control of his/her learning experience. Since understanding information is the key aspect of learning, it is important for learners to recognize what they understand and what they do not. By doing so, they can monitor their own mastery of subjects. Active learning encourages learners to have an internal dialogue in which they verbalize understandings. This and other meta-cognitive strategies can be taught to a child over time. Studies within [[metacognition]] have proven the value in active learning, claiming that the learning is usually at a stronger level as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[(Bransford, 2000, pg.15-20)]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, learners have more incentive to learn when they have control over not only how they learn but also what they learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113| title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J. Scott Armstrong| journal = Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning| year = 2012| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140916150012/https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113| archivedate = 2014-09-16| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Active learning is a key characteristic of [[student-centered learning]]. Conversely, [[passive learning]] and [[direct instruction]] are characteristics of teacher-centered learning (or [[traditional education]]).

The [[research]] works on the human learning process as a [[complex adaptive system]] developed by [[Peter Belohlavek]] showed that it is the concept that the individual has that drives the accommodation process to assimilate new knowledge in the [[long-term memory]], defining learning as an intrinsically freedom-oriented and active process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Ferro|first= María Laura|date=2003-01-05|title= Teoría Unicista: Otra manera de aprender|magazine= Revista Nueva|location= Nº 599, p. 10-12|publisher= Agrupación Diarios del Interior}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[student-centered learning]] approach, the unicist reflection driven learning installs adaptive knowledge objects in the mind of the learner based on a cyclic process of: “action-reflection-action” to foster an [[adaptive behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Caldas|first= Sérgio Túlio|date=1990-08-30|title= Economista cria centro de estudo empresarial|url= |work= O Estado de São Paulo|location= Economia, p. 9 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=3161708|title= Unicist Reflection Driven Learning for Superior Education|last= Belohlavek|first=Peter|date=2018-04-12|website= |publisher=SSRN|access-date= 2018-09-29|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Associative learning ===
''Associative learning'' is the process by which a person or animal learns an association between two stimuli or events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discovery Series: Introduction to Psychology|last=Plotnik|first=Rod|last2=Kouyomdijan|first2=Haig|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|year=2012|isbn=9781111347024|location=Belmont, CA|pages=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; In classical conditioning a previously neutral stimulus is repeatedly paired with a reflex eliciting stimulus until eventually the neutral stimulus elicits a response on its own. In operant conditioning, a behavior that is reinforced or punished in the presence of a stimulus becomes more or less likely to occur in the presence of that stimulus.

==== Operant conditioning ====
{{Main|Operant conditioning}}
In ''operant conditioning'', a reinforcement (by reward) or instead a punishment given after a given behavior, change the frequency and/or form of that behavior. Stimulus present when the behavior/consequence occurs come to control these behavior modifications.

==== Classical conditioning ====
{{Main|Classical conditioning}}
The typical paradigm for ''classical conditioning'' involves repeatedly pairing an unconditioned stimulus (which unfailingly evokes a reflexive response) with another previously neutral stimulus (which does not normally evoke the response). Following conditioning, the response occurs both to the unconditioned stimulus and to the other, unrelated stimulus (now referred to as the "conditioned stimulus"). The response to the conditioned stimulus is termed a ''conditioned response''. The classic example is [[Ivan Pavlov]] and his dogs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Pavlov fed his dogs meat powder, which naturally made the dogs salivate—salivating is a reflexive response to the meat powder. Meat powder is the unconditioned stimulus (US) and the salivation is the unconditioned response (UR). Pavlov rang a bell before presenting the meat powder. The first time Pavlov rang the bell, the neutral stimulus, the dogs did not salivate, but once he put the meat powder in their mouths they began to salivate. After numerous pairings of bell and food, the dogs learned that the bell signaled that food was about to come, and began to salivate when they heard the bell. Once this occurred, the bell became the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the salivation to the bell became the conditioned response (CR). Classical conditioning has been demonstrated in many species. For example, it is seen in honeybees, in the [[proboscis extension reflex]] paradigm.&lt;ref name="bitterman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bitterman | display-authors = etal | year = 1983 | title = Classical Conditioning of Proboscis Extension in Honeybees (''Apis mellifera'') | url = | journal = J. Comp. Psychol. | volume = 97 | issue = 2| pages = 107–119 | doi=10.1037/0735-7036.97.2.107}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was recently also demonstrated in garden pea plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gagliano|first=Monica|last2=Vyazovskiy|first2=Vladyslav V.|last3=Borbély|first3=Alexander A.|last4=Grimonprez|first4=Mavra|last5=Depczynski|first5=Martial|date=2016-12-02|title=Learning by Association in Plants|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep38427|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=38427|doi=10.1038/srep38427|issn=2045-2322|pmc=5133544|pmid=27910933|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623143237/http://www.nature.com/articles/srep38427|archivedate=2017-06-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influential person in the world of classical conditioning is [[John B. Watson]]. Watson's work was very influential and paved the way for [[B.F. Skinner]]'s radical behaviorism. Watson's behaviorism (and philosophy of science) stood in direct contrast to Freud and other accounts based largely on introspection. Watson's view was that the introspective method was too subjective, and that we should limit the study of human development to directly observable behaviors. In 1913, Watson published the article "Psychology as the Behaviorist Views," in which he argued that laboratory studies should serve psychology best as a science. Watson's most famous, and controversial, experiment, "[[Little Albert]]", where he demonstrated how psychologists can account for the learning of emotion through classical conditioning principles.

==== Observational learning ====
{{Main|Observational learning}}
''Observational learning'' is learning that occurs through observing the behavior of others. It is a form of social learning which takes various forms, based on various processes. In humans, this form of learning seems to not need reinforcement to occur, but instead, requires a social model such as a parent, sibling, friend, or teacher with surroundings.

==== Imprinting ====
{{Main|Imprinting (psychology)}}
''Imprinting'' is a kind of learning occurring at a particular life stage that is rapid and apparently independent of the consequences of behavior. In filial imprinting, young animals, particularly birds, form an association with another individual or in some cases, an object, that they respond to as they would to a parent. In 1935, the Austrian Zoologist Konrad Lorenz discovered that certain birds follow and form a bond if the object makes sounds.

=== Play ===
{{Main|Play (activity)}}
''Play'' generally describes behavior with no particular end in itself, but that improves performance in similar future situations. This is seen in a wide variety of vertebrates besides humans, but is mostly limited to [[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s. Cats are known to play with a ball of string when young, which gives them experience with catching prey. Besides inanimate objects, animals may play with other members of their own species or other animals, such as [[orca]]s playing with seals they have caught. Play involves a significant cost to animals, such as increased vulnerability to [[predator]]s and the risk of [[injury]] and possibly [[infection]]. It also consumes [[energy]], so there must be significant benefits associated with play for it to have evolved. Play is generally seen in younger animals, suggesting a link with learning. However, it may also have other benefits not associated directly with learning, for example improving [[physical fitness]].

Play, as it pertains to humans as a form of learning is central to a child's learning and development. Through play, children learn social skills such as sharing and collaboration. Children develop emotional skills such as learning to deal with the emotion of anger, through play activities. As a form of learning, play also facilitates the development of thinking and language skills in children.&lt;ref name="Lillemyr, O.F. 2009"&gt;Lillemyr, O.F. (2009). Taking play seriously. Children and play in early childhood education: an exciting challenge. Charlotte, NC: Information Age Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five types of play:
# sensorimotor play aka functional play, characterized by repetition of activity
# role play occurs starting at the age of 3
# rule-based play where authoritative prescribed codes of conduct are primary
# construction play involves experimentation and building
# movement play aka physical play&lt;ref name="Lillemyr, O.F. 2009"/&gt;

These five types of play are often intersecting. All types of play generate thinking and [[problem-solving]] skills in children. Children learn to think creatively when they learn through play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whitebread | first1 = D. | last2 = Coltman | first2 = P. | last3 = Jameson | first3 = H. | last4 = Lander | first4 = R. | year = 2009 | title = Play, cognition and self-regulation: What exactly are children learning when they learn through play? | url = | journal = Educational &amp; Child Psychology | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 40–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific activities involved in each type of play change over time as humans progress through the lifespan. Play as a form of learning, can occur solitarily, or involve interacting with others.

=== Enculturation ===
{{Main|Enculturation}}
''Enculturation'' is the process by which people learn values and behaviors that are appropriate or necessary in their surrounding culture.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"&gt;Grusec, Joan E.; Hastings, Paul D. "Handbook of Socialization: Theory and Research", 2007, Guilford Press; {{ISBN|1-59385-332-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59385-332-7}}; at page 547.&lt;/ref&gt; Parents, other adults, and peers shape the individual's understanding of these values.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"/&gt; If successful, enculturation results in competence in the language, values and rituals of the culture.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"/&gt; This is different from [[acculturation]], where a person adopts the values and societal rules of a culture different from their native one.

Multiple examples of enculturation can be found cross-culturally. Collaborative practices in the Mazahua people have shown that participation in everyday interaction and later learning activities contributed to enculturation rooted in nonverbal social experience.&lt;ref name="Paradise1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paradise|first1=Ruth|title=Interactional Style and Nonverbal Meaning: Mazahua Children Learning How to Be Separate-But-Together|journal=Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|date=1994|doi=10.1525/aeq.1994.25.2.05x0907w|volume=25|issue=2|pages=156–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the children participated in everyday activities, they learned the cultural significance of these interactions. The collaborative and helpful behaviors exhibited by Mexican and Mexican-heritage children is a cultural practice known as being "acomedido".&lt;ref name=Lopez2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lopez|first1=Angelica|last2=Najafi|first2=Behnosh|last3=Rogoff|first3=Barbara|last4=Mejia-Arauz|first4=Rebeca|title=Collaboration and helping as cultural practices|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Culture and Psychology|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chillihuani girls in Peru described themselves as weaving constantly, following behavior shown by the other adults.&lt;ref name=Bolin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bolin|first1=Inge|title=Growing Up in a Culture of Respect: Childrearing in highland Peru|date=2006|publisher=University of Texas|location=Austin|isbn=978-0-292-71298-0|pages=90–99|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Episodic learning ===
''Episodic learning'' is a change in behavior that occurs as a result of an event.&lt;ref&gt;Terry, W. S. (2006). Learning and Memory: Basic principles, processes, and procedures. Boston: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a fear of dogs that follows being bitten by a dog is episodic learning. Episodic learning is so named because events are recorded into [[episodic memory]], which is one of the three forms of explicit learning and retrieval, along with perceptual memory and [[semantic memory]].&lt;ref&gt;Baars, B. J. &amp; Gage, N. M. (2007). Cognition, Brain, and Consciousness: Introduction to cognitive neuroscience. London: Elsevier Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Episodic memory remembers events and history that are embedded in experience and this is distinguished from semantic memory, which attempts to extract facts out of their experiential context&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sixth International Conference on Cognitive Modeling: ICCM - 2004|last=Lovett|first=Marsha|last2=Schunn|first2=Christian|last3=Lebiere|first3=Christian|last4=Munro|first4=Paul|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers|year=2004|isbn=978-0805854268|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|pages=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; or - as some describe - a timeless organization of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Artificial Intelligence: Critical Concepts, Volume 1|last=Chrisley|first=Ronald|last2=Begeer|first2=Sander|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=978-0415193320|location=London|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if a person remembers the [[Grand Canyon National Park|Grand Canyon]] from a recent visit, it is an episodic memory. He would use semantic memory to answer someone who would ask him information such as where the Grand Canyon is. A study revealed that humans are very accurate in the recognition of episodic memory even without deliberate intention to memorize it.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Cognitive Neuroscience: A Beginner's Guide|last=Gage|first=Nicole|last2=Baars|first2=Bernard|publisher=Academic Press|year=2018|isbn=9780128038130|location=London|pages=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is said to indicate a very large storage capacity of the brain for things that people pay attention to.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Multimedia learning ===
{{Main|Multimedia learning}}
''Multimedia learning'' is where a person uses both auditory and visual stimuli to learn information {{Harv|Mayer|2001}}. This type of learning relies on [[dual-coding theory]] {{Harv|Paivio|1971}}.

=== E-learning and augmented learning ===
{{Main|Electronic learning}}
''Electronic learning'' or e-learning is computer-enhanced learning. A specific and always more diffused e-learning is [[mobile learning]] (m-learning), which uses different mobile telecommunication equipment, such as [[cellular phone]]s.

When a learner interacts with the e-learning environment, it's called [[augmented learning]]. By adapting to the needs of individuals, the context-driven instruction can be dynamically tailored to the learner's natural environment. Augmented digital content may include text, images, video, audio (music and voice). By personalizing instruction, augmented learning has been shown to improve learning performance for a lifetime.&lt;ref name="Augmented Learning"&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1156186 Augmented Learning], Augmented Learning: Context-Aware Mobile Augmented Reality Architecture for Learning&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[minimally invasive education]].

Moore (1989)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = M | year = 1989 | title = Three types of interaction | url = | journal = American Journal of Distance Education | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 1–6 | doi=10.1080/08923648909526659| citeseerx = 10.1.1.491.4800 }}&lt;/ref&gt; purported that three core types of interaction are necessary for quality, effective online learning:
* learner–learner (i.e. communication between and among peers with or without the teacher present),
* learner–instructor (i.e. student teacher communication), and
* learner–content (i.e. intellectually interacting with content that results in changes in learners' understanding, perceptions, and cognitive structures).
In his theory of transactional distance, Moore (1993)&lt;ref&gt;Moore, M. G. (1993). Theory of transactional distance. In D. Keegan (Ed.), Theoretical principles of distance education (pp. 22-38). London and New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; contented that structure and interaction or dialogue bridge the gap in understanding and communication that is created by geographical distances (known as transactional distance).

=== Rote learning ===
{{Main|Rote learning}}
''Rote learning'' is [[memorizing]] information so that it can be [[recollection|recalled]] by the learner exactly the way it was read or heard. The major technique used for rote learning is ''learning by repetition'', based on the idea that a learner can recall the material exactly (but not its meaning) if the information is repeatedly processed. Rote learning is used in diverse areas, from mathematics to music to religion. Although it has been criticized by some educators, rote learning is a necessary precursor to meaningful learning.

=== Meaningful learning ===
{{See also|Deeper Learning}}
''Meaningful learning'' is the concept that learned knowledge (e.g., a fact) is fully understood to the extent that it relates to other knowledge. To this end, meaningful learning contrasts with [[rote learning]] in which information is acquired without regard to understanding. Meaningful learning, on the other hand, implies there is a comprehensive knowledge of the context of the facts learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassard|first=Jack|title=Backup of Meaningful Learning Model|url=http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/advorgbk02.htm|accessdate=30 November 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029042955/http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/advorgbk02.htm|archivedate=29 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Informal learning ===
{{Main|Informal learning}}
''Informal learning'' occurs through the experience of day-to-day situations (for example, one would learn to look ahead while walking because of the danger inherent in not paying attention to where one is going). It is learning from life, during a meal at table with parents, [[play (activity)|play]], exploring, etc.

=== Formal learning ===
{{Main|Education}}
[[Image:Laurentius de Voltolina 001.jpg|right|225px|thumb|A depiction of the world's oldest continually operating university, the [[University of Bologna]], Italy]]
''Formal learning'' is learning that takes place within a teacher-student relationship, such as in a school system. The term formal learning has nothing to do with the formality of the learning, but rather the way it is directed and organized. In formal learning, the learning or training departments set out the goals and objectives of the learning.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, J., and Dale, M., [http://www.knowledgejump.com/learning/informal.html " Informal Learning in the Workplace"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121140538/http://www.knowledgejump.com/learning/informal.html |date=2013-01-21 }}, '' Department for Education and Employment Research Report No. 134. London, England: Department for Education and Employment'', August 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nonformal learning ===
{{Main|Nonformal learning}}
''Nonformal learning'' is organized learning outside the formal learning system. For example, learning by coming together with people with similar interests and exchanging viewpoints, in clubs or in (international) youth organizations, workshops.

=== Nonformal learning and combined approaches ===
The educational system may use a combination of formal, informal, and nonformal learning methods. The UN and EU recognize these different forms of learning (cf. links below). In some schools, students can get points that count in the formal-learning systems if they get work done in informal-learning circuits. They may be given time to assist international youth workshops and training courses, on the condition they prepare, contribute, share and can prove this offered valuable new insight, helped to acquire new skills, a place to get experience in organizing, [[teaching]], etc.

To learn a skill, such as solving a [[Rubik's Cube]] quickly, several factors come into play at once:
* Reading directions helps a player learn the patterns that solve the Rubik's Cube.
* Practicing the moves repeatedly helps build "[[muscle memory]]" and speed.
* Thinking critically about moves helps find shortcuts, which speeds future attempts.
* Observing the Rubik's Cube's six colors help anchor solutions in the mind.
* Revisiting the cube occasionally helps retain the skill.

=== Tangential learning ===
''Tangential learning'' is the process by which people self-educate if a topic is exposed to them in a context that they already enjoy. For example, after playing a music-based video game, some people may be motivated to learn how to play a real instrument, or after watching a TV show that references Faust and Lovecraft, some people may be inspired to read the original work.&lt;ref&gt;Tangential Learning {{cite web |url=http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/tangential-learning |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104053746/http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/tangential-learning |archivedate=2012-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-education can be improved with systematization. According to experts in natural learning,
self-oriented learning training has proven an effective tool for assisting independent learners with the natural phases of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1039&amp;context=marketing_papers | title = The Natural Learning Project | author = J.

''[[Extra Credits]]'' writer and game designer James Portnow was the first to suggest games as a potential venue for "tangential learning".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robert|first=Rath,|date=2015-01-22|title=Game Criticism as Tangential Learning Facilitator: The Case of Critical Intel|url=http://gamescriticism.org/articles/rath-2-1/|journal=Journal of Games Criticism|language=en-US|volume=2|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mozelius ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mozelius et al|first=|date=|title=Motivating Factors and Tangential Learning for Knowledge Acquisition in Educational Games|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1154724.pdf|journal=The Electronic Journal of E-Learning|volume= 15| issue = 4 2017|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; points out that intrinsic integration of learning content seems to be a crucial design factor, and that games that include modules for further self-studies tend to present good results. The built-in encyclopedias in the ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]]'' games are presented as an example - by using these modules gamers can dig deeper for knowledge about historical events in the gameplay. The importance of rules that regulate learning modules and game experience is discussed by Moreno, C.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moreno|first=Carlos|date=|year=2014|title=Kiwaka {{!}} Kiwaka Story (by LANDKA®)|url=http://www.lifeplay.es/volumen3/Analisis/067_070_RAMIREZ_MORENO_Analisis.pdf|journal=LifePlay|volume=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a case study about the mobile game {{Wikidata entity link| Q55416666}}.

=== Dialogic learning ===
{{Main|Dialogic learning}}
''Dialogic learning'' is a type of learning based on dialogue.

=== Incidental learning ===
In ''incidental teaching'' learning is not planned by the instructor or the student, it occurs as a byproduct of another activity — an experience, observation, self-reflection, interaction, unique event, or common routine task. This learning happens in addition to or apart from the instructor's plans and the student's expectations. An example of incidental teaching is when the instructor places a train set on top of a cabinet. If the child points or walks towards the cabinet, the instructor prompts the student to say “train.” Once the student says “train,” he gets access to the train set.

Here are some steps most commonly used in incidental teaching:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nspt4kids.com/healthtopics-and-conditions-database/incidental-teaching/|title=What is incidental teaching?|year=2017|website=North Shore Pediatric Therapy, Illinois|access-date=August 29, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829204217/http://nspt4kids.com/healthtopics-and-conditions-database/incidental-teaching/|archivedate=August 29, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An instructor will arrange the learning environment so that necessary materials are within the student's sight, but not within his reach, thus impacting his motivation to seek out those materials.
* An instructor waits for the student to initiate engagement.
* An instructor prompts the student to respond if needed.
* An instructor allows access to an item/activity contingent on a correct response from the student.
* The instructor fades out the prompting process over a period of time and subsequent trials.

Incidental learning is an occurrence that is not generally accounted for using the traditional methods of instructional objectives and outcomes assessment. This type of learning occurs in part as a product of social interaction and active involvement in both online and onsite courses. Research implies that some un-assessed aspects of onsite and online learning challenge the equivalency of education between the two modalities. Both onsite and online learning have distinct advantages with traditional on-campus students experiencing higher degrees of incidental learning in three times as many areas as online students. Additional research is called for to investigate the implications of these findings both conceptually and pedagogically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Konetes|first1=George|title=The Effects of Distance Education and Student Involvement on Incidental Learning|journal=IUP Doctoral Dissertations|date=2011|pages=115|url=https://dspace.iup.edu/bitstream/handle/2069/477/George%20Konetes.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=2014-07-12|ref=Incidental Learning|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714130414/https://dspace.iup.edu/bitstream/handle/2069/477/George%20Konetes.pdf?sequence=1|archivedate=2014-07-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Domains ==
[[File:France in XXI Century. School.jpg|thumb|270px|''Future school'' (1901 or 1910)]]
[[Benjamin Bloom]] has suggested three domains of learning:
* [[Cognitive]]: To recall, calculate, discuss, analyze, problem solve, etc.
* [[Psychomotor learning|Psychomotor]]: To dance, swim, ski, dive, drive a car, ride a bike, etc.
* [[Affective]]: To like something or someone, love, appreciate, fear, hate, worship, etc.

These domains are not mutually exclusive. For example, in learning to play [[chess]], the person must learn the rules (cognitive domain)—but must also learn how to set up the chess pieces and how to properly hold and move a chess piece (psychomotor). Furthermore, later in the game the person may even learn to love the game itself, value its applications in life, and appreciate its [[history of chess|history]] (affective domain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessballs.com/bloomstaxonomyoflearningdomains.htm|title=Bloom's Taxonomy|author=|date=|website=www.businessballs.com|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transfer ==
Transfer of learning is the application of skill, knowledge or understanding to resolve a novel problem or situation that happens when certain conditions are fulfilled. Research indicates that learning transfer is infrequent; most common when "... cued, primed, and guided..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=D.N.|author2=Salomon, G. |title=Are Cognitive Skills Context-Bound?|journal=Educational Researcher|date=Jan–Feb 1989|volume=18|issue=1|pages=16–25 [19]|doi=10.3102/0013189x018001016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has sought to clarify what it is, and how it might be promoted through instruction.

Over the history of its discourse, various hypotheses and definitions have been advanced. First, it is speculated that different types of transfer exist, including: near transfer, the application of skill to solve a novel problem in a similar context; and far transfer, the application of skill to solve novel problem presented in a different context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Committee on Developments in the Science of Learning with additional material from the Committee on Learning Research|title=Chapter 3. Learning and Transfer. How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School: Expanded Edition|year=2000|publisher=The National Academies Press|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9853|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426234827/http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9853|archivedate=2013-04-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Perkins and Salomon (1992) suggest that positive transfer in cases when learning supports novel problem solving, and negative transfer occurs when prior learning inhibits performance on highly correlated tasks, such as second or third-language learning.&lt;ref name="Perkins"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=D.N.|author2=Salomon, G. |title=Transfer of Learning|journal=International Encyclopedia of Education|year=1992|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts of positive and negative transfer have a long history; researchers in the early 20th century described the possibility that "...habits or mental acts developed by a particular kind of training may inhibit rather than facilitate other mental activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Agnes L.|title=The Bearing of the New Psychology upon the Teaching of Mathematics|journal=Teacher's College Record|year=1916|volume=17|pages=344–352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Schwarz, Bransford and Sears (2005) have proposed that transferring knowledge into a situation may differ from transferring knowledge out to a situation as a means to reconcile findings that transfer may both be frequent and challenging to promote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwartz, Daniel L., John D. Bransford, and David Sears|title=Efficiency and innovation in transfer: Transfer of learning from a modern multidisciplinary perspective|year=2005|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant and long research history has also attempted to explicate the conditions under which transfer of learning might occur. Early research by Ruger, for example, found that the "level of attention", "attitudes", "method of attack" (or method for tackling a problem), a "search for new points of view", "a careful testing of hypothesis" and "generalization" were all valuable approaches for promoting transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruger|first=Henry Alfred|title=The psychology of efficiency: an experimental study of the processes involved in the solution of mechanical puzzles and in the acquisition of skill in their manipulation|journal=Science Press|year=1910|volume=19|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; To encourage transfer through teaching, Perkins and Salomon recommend aligning ("hugging") instruction with practice and assessment, and "bridging", or encouraging learners to reflect on past experiences or make connections between prior knowledge and current content.&lt;ref name="Perkins" /&gt;

== Factors affecting learning ==

=== External factors ===
# ''[[Heredity]]'': A classroom instructor can neither change nor increase heredity, but the student can use and develop it. Some learners are rich in hereditary endowment while others are poor. Each student is unique and has different abilities. The native intelligence is different in individuals. Heredity governs or conditions our ability to learn and the rate of learning. The intelligent learners can establish and see relationship very easily and more quickly.
# ''Status of students'': Physical and home conditions also matter: Certain problems like malnutrition i.e.; inadequate supply of nutrients to the body, fatigue i.e.; tiredness, bodily weakness, and bad health are great obstructers in learning. These are some of the physical conditions by which a student can get affected. Home is a place where a family lives. If the home conditions are not proper, the student is affected seriously. Some of the home conditions are bad ventilation, unhygienic living, bad light, etc. These affect the student and his or her rate of learning.&lt;ref name="Ref 1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mangal|first1=S.K.|title=ESSENTIALS OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY|date=January 5, 2007|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd|isbn= 9788120330559|page=736}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref 2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aggarwal|first1=J.C|title=Essentials Of Educational Psychology|date=November 1, 2009|publisher=Vikas Publishing House Pvt Ltd|isbn= 9788125922926|page=596|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Physical environment'': The design, quality, and setting of a [[learning space]], such as a school or classroom, can each be critical to the success of a [[learning environment]]. Size, configuration, comfort—fresh air, temperature, light, acoustics, furniture—can all affect a student's learning. The tools used by both instructors and students directly affect how information is conveyed, from display and writing surfaces (blackboards, markerboards, tack surfaces) to digital technologies. For example, if a room is too crowded, stress levels rise, student attention is reduced, and furniture arrangement is restricted. If furniture is incorrectly arranged, sight lines to the instructor or instructional material is limited and the ability to suit the learning or lesson style is restricted. Aesthetics can also play a role, for if student morale suffers, so does motivation to attend school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edutopia.org/article/new-teachers-designing-classroom-learning-environment-resources ''New Teachers: Designing Learning Environments'', May 7, 2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328041804/http://www.edutopia.org/article/new-teachers-designing-classroom-learning-environment-resources |date=March 28, 2016 }}.

=== Internal factors ===
There are several internal factors that affect learning.&lt;ref name="Ref 3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mangal|first1=SK|title=ADVANCED EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY|date=January 1, 2002|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd|isbn=9788120320383|page=536|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref 4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bhatia|first1=H.R|title=Elements Of Educational Psychology|date=January 1, 1973|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn= 9788125000297|page=558}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are
# ''Goals or purposes'': Each and everyone has a goal. A goal should be set to each pupil according to the standard expected to him. A goal is an aim or desired result. There are 2 types of goals called immediate and distant goals. A goal that occurs or is done at once is called an ''immediate goal,'' and ''distant goals'' are those that take time to achieve. Immediate goals should be set before the young learner and distant goals for older learners. Goals should be specific and clear, so that learners understand.
# ''Motivational behavior'': Motivation means to provide with a motive. Motivation learners should be motivated so that they stimulate themselves with interest. This behavior arouses and regulates the student's internal energies.
# ''Interest'': This is a quality that arouses a feeling. It encourages a student to move over tasks further. During teaching, the instructor must raise interests among students for the best learning. Interest is an apparent (clearly seen or understood) behaviour.
# ''Attention'': Attention means consideration. It is concentration or focusing of consciousness upon one object or an idea. If effective learning should take place attention is essential. Instructors must secure the attention of the student.
# ''Drill or practice'': This method includes repeating the tasks "n" number of times like needs, phrases, principles, etc. This makes learning more effective.
# ''Fatigue'': Generally there are three types of fatigue, i.e., muscular, sensory, and mental. Muscular and sensory fatigues are bodily fatigue. Mental fatigue is in the central nervous system. The remedy is to change teaching methods, e.g., use audio-visual aids, etc.
# ''[[Aptitude]]'': Aptitude is natural ability. It is a condition in which an individuals ability to acquire certain skills, knowledge through training.
# ''[[Attitude (psychology)|Attitude]]'': It is a way of thinking. The attitude of the student must be tested to find out how much inclination he or she has for learning a subject or topic.
# ''Emotional conditions'': Emotions are physiological states of being. Students who answer a question properly or give good results should be praised. This encouragement increases their ability and helps them produce better results. Certain attitudes, such as always finding fault in a student's answer or provoking or embarrassing the student in front of a class are counterproductive.
# ''Speed, Accuracy and retention'': Speed is the rapidity of movement. Retention is the act of retaining. These 3 elements depend upon aptitude, attitude, interest, attention and motivation of the students.
# ''Learning activities'': Learning depends upon the activities and experiences provided by the teacher, his concept of discipline, methods of teaching and above all his overall personality.
# ''Testing'': Various tests measure individual learner differences at the heart of effective learning. Testing helps eliminate subjective elements of measuring pupil differences and performances.
# ''Guidance'': Everyone needs guidance in some part or some time in life. Some need it constantly and some very rarely depending on the students conditions. Small learners need more guidance. Guidance is an advice to solve a problem. Guidance involves the art of helping boys and girls in various aspects of academics, improving vocational aspects like choosing careers and recreational aspects like choosing hobbies. Guidance covers the whole gamut of learners problems- learning as well as non- learning.

== In animal evolution ==
Animals gain knowledge in two ways. First is learning—in which an animal gathers information about its environment and uses this information. For example, if an animal eats something that hurts its stomach, it learns not to eat that again. The second is innate knowledge that is genetically inherited. An example of this is when a horse is born and can immediately walk. The horse has not learned this behavior; it simply knows how to do it.&lt;ref name="Dunlap"&gt;DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf. at &lt;{{cite web|url=http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/51978/1/DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113233355/http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/51978/1/DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-13 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In some scenarios, [[Instinct|innate knowledge]] is more beneficial than learned knowledge. However, in other scenarios the opposite is true—animals must learn certain behaviors when it is disadvantageous to have a specific innate behavior. In these situations, learning [[Evolution|evolves]] in the species.

=== Costs and benefits of learned and innate knowledge ===
In a changing environment, an animal must constantly gain new information to survive. However, in a stable environment, this same individual needs to gather the information it needs once, and then rely on it for the rest of its life. Therefore, different scenarios better suit either learning or innate knowledge.
Essentially, the cost of obtaining certain knowledge versus the benefit of already having it determines whether an animal evolved to learn in a given situation, or whether it innately knew the information. If the cost of gaining the knowledge outweighs the benefit of having it, then the animal does not evolve to learn in this scenario—but instead, non-learning evolves. However, if the benefit of having certain information outweighs the cost of obtaining it, then the animal is far more likely to evolve to have to learn this information.&lt;ref name="Dunlap" /&gt;

Non-learning is more likely to evolve in two scenarios. If an environment is static and change does not or rarely occurs, then learning is simply unnecessary. Because there is no need for learning in this scenario—and because learning could prove disadvantageous due to the time it took to learn the information—non-learning evolves. However, if an environment is in a constant state of change, then learning is disadvantageous. Anything learned is immediately irrelevant because of the changing environment.&lt;ref name="Dunlap" /&gt; The learned information no longer applies. Essentially, the animal would be just as successful if it took a guess as if it learned. In this situation, non-learning evolves. In fact, a study of ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' showed that learning can actually lead to a decrease in productivity, possibly because egg-laying behaviors and decisions were impaired by interference from the memories gained from the new learned materials or because of the cost of energy in learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.12.005 | volume=68 | issue=3 | title=An operating cost of learning in Drosophila melanogaster | journal=Animal Behaviour | pages=589–598| year=2004 | last1=Mery | first1=Frederic | last2=Kawecki | first2=Tadeusz J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in environments where change occurs within an animal's lifetime but is not constant, learning is more likely to evolve. Learning is beneficial in these scenarios because an animal can [[Adaptation|adapt]] to the new situation, but can still apply the knowledge that it learns for a somewhat extended period of time. Therefore, learning increases the chances of success as opposed to guessing.&lt;ref name="Dunlap" /&gt; An example of this is seen in aquatic environments with landscapes subject to change. In these environments, learning is favored because the fish are predisposed to learn the specific spatial cues where they live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Odling-Smee | first1 = L. | last2 = Braithwaite | first2 = V. A. | year = 2003 | title = The role of learning in fish orientation | url = | journal = Fish and Fisheries | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 235–246 | doi = 10.1046/j.1467-2979.2003.00127.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Machine learning, a branch of [[artificial intelligence]], concerns the construction and study of systems that can learn from data. For example, a machine learning system could be trained on email messages to learn to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages.

The measured growth rates of ''R. geographicum'' tends to fall within the range of 0.9 - 0.3 millimeter per year, depending on several factors, including the size of the lichen patch. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ARMSTRONG|first=R.

Among the potential problems of the technique are the difficulty of correctly identifying the species, delay between exposure and colonization, varying growth rates from region to region as well as the fact that growth rates are not always constant over time, dependence of the rate of growth upon substrate texture and composition, climate, and determining which lichen is the largest.&lt;ref name="innes" /&gt;

==Methods==
[[image:Xanthoria elegans 97571.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Xanthoria elegans]]'' was one of the first lichens used for lichenometry.]]
Several methods exist for dating surfaces with help of lichenometry; the most simple relies on a single largest lichen while other methods use more. There are also differences in the way the lichen is measured; while some suggest that the largest [[diameter]] should be measured, other scientists prefer the diameter of the largest inscribed circle. A problem in dating lichens is the fact that several [[thalli]] can fuse together, making several minor lichens appears as a larger one of older age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwellpublishing.com:443/Microbiology/pdfs/lichens.pdf Lichen, Lichenometry and Global Warming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708012620/http://www.blackwellpublishing.com:443/Microbiology/pdfs/lichens.pdf |date=2011-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichenometrist Tom Bradwell has listed the following five method families as the principal ones into which most other methods can be classified:
*'''Largest lichen (LL):''' When the single largest lichen of a species is used it means that the lichen that is oldest or grows in most favorable conditions is used to date the minimum age of the exposed surface. This was the original lichenometric from which others then developed or used as reference. Despite relying upon a single lichen this technique is praised for its simplicity and allows obtaining an image of the age of rock exposure while still in the field.&lt;ref name=GA&gt;Bradwell, Tom 2009. Lichenometric Dating: A commentary in the light of some recent statistical studies. [[Geografiska Annaler]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Largest five lichens (5LL):''' This method is a development of the '''LL''' and was developed in the 1970s to avoid reliance on one single potentially anomalous lichen. It has been proved that neither accuracy nor precision improves significantly by having more than five lichens.&lt;ref name=GA/&gt;
*'''Fixed-area largest lichen (FALL):''' This technique was initially specially designed for dating rockfalls and [[talus cone]]s with no uniform age of deposition. The largest [[thallus]] in a unit area is measured. The sample areas are usually boulders with surfaces of about 1&amp;nbsp;m².&lt;ref name=GA/&gt;
*'''Size-frequency approach (SF):''' The analysis of size and frequency of lichens was initially done in order to study lichen populations and preexisting thalli growing on surfaces, but has since been used as an effective absolute and relative dating method.&lt;ref name=GA/&gt;
*'''Lichen cover approach (LC):''' This method works with the premise of that the area covered by a single species will increase over time, and by measuring the total area percentage covered by a certain lichen species the age of exposure can be inferred.&lt;ref name=GA/&gt;

A '''manta trawl''' is a net system for sampling the surface of the ocean.  It resembles a [[manta ray]], with metal wings and a broad mouth. The net it pulls is made of thin mesh, and the whole [[trawl]] is towed behind a scientific [[research vessel]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Charles.[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1134/is_9_112/ai_110737008/pg_3/ "Trashed: across the Pacific Ocean, plastics, plastics, everywhere"], ''Natural History'', November, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  The manta trawl is useful for collecting samples from the surface of the ocean, such as sampling the plastic pieces making up the [[great Pacific garbage patch]] as well as the associated [[plankton]].

&lt;!-- This article uses UK English --&gt;
The marine environment supplies many kinds of [[habitat]]s that support marine life. [[Marine life]] depends in some way on the [[seawater|saltwater]] that is in the sea (the term ''marine'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''mare'', meaning sea or ocean). A habitat is an [[ecological]] or [[Natural environment|environmental]] area inhabited by one or more living  [[species]].&lt;ref name="Dickinson 63"&gt;Dickinson, C.I. 1963. ''British Seaweeds.'' The Kew Series&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abercrombie 66"&gt;Abercrombie, M., Hickman, C.J. and Johnson, M.L. 1966.''A Dictionary of Biology.'' Penguin Reference Books, London&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marine habitats''' can be divided into [[coastal]] and [[open ocean]] habitats. Coastal habitats are found in the area that extends from as far as the tide comes in on the [[shoreline]] out to the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only seven percent of the total ocean area. Open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental shelf.

Alternatively, marine habitats can be divided into [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] and [[demersal zone]]s. Pelagic habitats are found near the surface or in the open [[water column]], away from the bottom of the ocean. Demersal habitats are near or on the bottom of the ocean. An organism living in a pelagic habitat is said to be a pelagic organism, as in [[pelagic fish]]. Similarly, an organism living in a demersal habitat is said to be a demersal organism, as in [[demersal fish]]. Pelagic habitats are intrinsically shifting and ephemeral, depending on what [[ocean current]]s are doing.

Marine habitats can be modified by their inhabitants. Some marine organisms, like [[coral]]s, [[kelp]], [[mangrove]]s and [[seagrass]]es, are [[ecosystem engineer]]s which reshape the marine environment to the point where they create further habitat for other organisms.

==Overview==
[[File:BlueMarble-2001-2002.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Only 29 percent of the world surface is land. The rest is ocean, home to the marine habitats. The oceans are nearly four kilometres deep on average and are fringed with coastlines that run for nearly 380,000 kilometres.|alt=Two views of the ocean from space]]

In contrast to terrestrial habitats, marine habitats are shifting and ephemeral. Swimming organisms find areas by the edge of a [[continental shelf]] a good habitat, but only while [[upwelling]]s bring nutrient rich water to the surface. Shellfish find habitat on sandy beaches, but storms, tides and currents mean their habitat continually reinvents itself.

The presence of [[seawater]] is common to all marine habitats. Beyond that many other things determine whether a marine area makes a good habitat and the type of habitat it makes. For example:
* temperature – is affected by geographical [[latitude]], [[ocean currents]], [[weather]], the discharge of rivers, and by the presence of [[hydrothermal vent]]s or [[cold seep]]s
* sunlight – [[photosynthetic]] processes depend on how deep and [[turbid]] the water is
* nutrients – are transported by ocean currents to different marine habitats from [[land runoff]], or by upwellings from the deep sea, or they sink through the sea as [[marine snow]]
* salinity – varies, particularly in [[estuaries]] or near [[river delta]]s, or by hydrothermal vents
* dissolved gases – oxygen levels in particular, can be increased by wave actions and decreased during [[algal bloom]]s
* acidity – this is partly to do with dissolved gases above, since the acidity of the ocean is largely controlled by how much carbon dioxide is in the water.
* turbulence –  [[ocean wave]]s, fast currents and the agitation of water affect the nature of habitats
* cover – the availability of cover such as the adjacency of the [[Benthic zone|sea bottom]], or the presence of [[Pelagic fish#Floating objects|floating objects]]
* the occupying organisms themselves – since organisms modify their habitats by the act of occupying them, and some, like corals, kelp, mangroves and seagrasses, create further habitats for other organisms.

The ocean occupies 71 percent of the world surface, averaging nearly four kilometres in depth. There are five major oceans, of which the [[Pacific Ocean]] is nearly as large as the rest put together. Coastlines fringe the land for nearly 380,000 kilometres.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Marine habitats can be broadly divided into [[pelagic]] and [[demersal]] habitats.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Pelagic habitats are the habitats of the open [[water column]], away from the bottom of the ocean. Demersal habitats are the habitats that are near or on the bottom of the ocean. An organism living in a pelagic habitat is said to be a pelagic organism, as in [[pelagic fish]]. Similarly, an organism living in a demersal habitat is said to be a demersal organism, as in [[demersal fish]]. Pelagic habitats are intrinsically ephemeral, depending on what [[ocean current]]s are doing.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Ocean currents==
[[File:Oceanic gyres.png|thumb|left|[[Ocean gyre]]s rotate clockwise in the north and counterclockwise in the south]]

In marine systems, [[ocean current]]s have a key role determining which areas are effective as habitats, since ocean currents transport the basic nutrients needed to support marine life.&lt;ref name="Marietta Ocean"&gt;[http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/oceans.htm Ocean Habitats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523231058/http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/oceans.htm |date=2011-05-23 }} ''Marietta College''. Retrieved 17 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plankton]] are the life forms that inhabit the ocean that are so small (less than 2&amp;nbsp;mm) that they cannot effectively propel themselves through the water, but must drift instead with the currents. If the current carries the right nutrients, and if it also flows at a suitably shallow depth where there is plenty of sunlight, then such a current itself can become a suitable habitat for photosynthesizing tiny algae called [[phytoplankton]]. These tiny plants are the [[Primary production|primary producers]] in the ocean, at the start of the [[food chain]]. In turn, as the population of drifting phytoplankton grows, the water becomes a suitable habitat for [[zooplankton]], which feed on the phytoplankton. While phytoplankton are tiny drifting plants, zooplankton are tiny drifting animals, such as the [[larvae]] of [[fish]] and [[marine invertebrate]]s. If sufficient zooplankton establish themselves, the current becomes a candidate habitat for the [[forage fish]] that feed on them. And then if sufficient forage fish move to the area, it becomes a candidate habitat for larger [[predatory fish]] and other marine animals that feed on the forage fish. In this dynamic way, the current itself can, over time, become a moving habitat for multiple types of marine life.

[[File:Cwall99 lg.jpg|thumb|right|This [[algae bloom]] occupies sunlit [[epipelagic]] waters off the southern coast of England. The algae are maybe feeding on nutrients from [[land runoff]] or [[upwelling]]s at the edge of the continental shelf]]

Ocean currents can be generated by differences in the density of the water. How dense water is depends on how saline or warm it is. If water contains differences in salt content or temperature, then the different densities will initiate a current. Water that is saltier or cooler will be denser, and will sink in relation to the surrounding water. Conversely, warmer and less salty water will float to the surface. Atmospheric winds and pressure differences also produces surface currents, [[Ocean wave|waves]] and [[seiche]]s. Ocean currents are also generated by the gravitational pull of the sun and moon ([[tide]]s), and seismic activity ([[tsunami]]).&lt;ref name="Marietta Ocean" /&gt;

The rotation of the Earth affects the direction ocean currents take, and explains which way the large circular [[ocean gyre]]s rotate in the image above left. Suppose a current at the equator is heading north. The Earth rotates eastward, so the water possesses that rotational momentum. But the further the water moves north, the slower the earth moves eastward. If the current could get to the North Pole, the earth wouldn't be moving eastward at all. To conserve its rotational momentum, the further the current travels north the faster it must move eastward. So the effect is that the current curves to the right. This is the [[Coriolis effect]]. It is weakest at the equator and strongest at the poles. The effect is opposite south of the equator, where currents curve left.&lt;ref name="Marietta Ocean" /&gt;

==Marine topography==
[[File:Ocean gravity map.gif|right|thumb|300px|Map of underwater topography (1995 [[NOAA]])]]

Marine (or seabed or ocean) [[topography]] refers to the shape the land has when it interfaces with the ocean. These shapes are obvious along coastlines, but they occur also in significant ways underwater. The effectiveness of marine habitats is partially defined by these shapes, including the way they interact with and shape [[ocean current]]s, and the way sunlight diminishes when these landforms occupy increasing depths. Tidal networks depend on the balance between sedimentary processes and hydrodynamics however, anthropogenic influences can impact the natural system more than any physical driver.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Coco, Z. Zhou, B. van Maanen, M. Olabarrieta, R. Tinoco, I. Townend. Morphodynamics of tidal networks: Advances and challenges. Marine Geology Journal. 1 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine topographies include [[List of landforms#Coastal and oceanic landforms|coastal and oceanic landforms]] ranging from coastal [[Estuary|estuaries]] and [[shoreline]]s to [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] and [[coral reef]]s. Further out in the open ocean, they include underwater and [[deep sea]] features such as ocean rises and [[seamount]]s. The submerged surface has mountainous features, including a globe-spanning [[mid-ocean ridge]] system, as well as undersea [[volcano]]es,&lt;ref name="ngdc2006" /&gt; [[oceanic trench]]es, [[submarine canyon]]s, [[oceanic plateau]]s and [[abyssal plain]]s.

The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35{{e|18}}&amp;nbsp;[[metric ton]]s, or about 1/4400 of the total mass of the Earth. The oceans cover an area of 3.618{{e|8}}&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a mean depth of 3,682&amp;nbsp;m, resulting in an estimated volume of 1.332{{e|9}}&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=ocean23_2_112 /&gt;

==Coastal==
[[File:Porto Covo pano April 2009-4.jpg|thumb|360px|right|Coastlines can be volatile habitats]]
{{see also|Coast|Coastal biogeomorphology|Coastal fish}}

[[Coast|Marine coasts]] are dynamic environments which constantly change, like the ocean which partially shape them. The Earth's natural processes, including [[weather]] and [[sea level rise|sea level change]], result in the [[erosion]], [[Accretion (geology)|accretion]] and resculpturing of coasts as well as the flooding and creation of [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] and [[drowned river valley]]s.

The main agents responsible for deposition and [[erosion]] along coastlines are [[wind wave|waves]], [[tide]]s and [[Ocean current|currents]]. The formation of coasts also depends on the [[lithology|nature of the rocks]] they are made of – the harder the rocks the less likely they are to erode, so variations in rock hardness result in coastlines with different shapes.

[[Tide]]s often determine the range over which [[sediment]] is deposited or eroded. Areas with high tidal ranges allow waves to reach farther up the shore, and areas with lower tidal ranges produce deposition at a smaller elevation interval. The tidal range is influenced by the size and shape of the coastline. Tides do not typically cause erosion by themselves; however, [[tidal bore]]s can erode as the waves surge up river [[Estuary|estuaries]] from the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (2002), p.421.&lt;/ref&gt;

Waves erode coastline as they break on shore releasing their energy; the larger the wave the more energy it releases and the more sediment it moves. Sediment deposited by waves comes from eroded cliff faces and is moved along the coastline by the waves. Sediment deposited by rivers is the dominant influence on the amount of sediment located on a coastline.&lt;ref&gt;Easterbrook (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sedimentology|sedimentologist]] [[Francis Shepard]] classified coasts as ''primary'' or ''secondary''.&lt;ref name="Shepard"&gt;Shepard FP (1937) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30056777 Revised "Classification of Marine Shorelines"] ''The Journal of Geology,'' '''45'''(6): 602–624.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Primary coasts are shaped by non-marine processes, by changes in the land form. If a coast is in much the same condition as it was when sea level was stabilised after the last ice age, it is called a primary coast.&lt;ref name="Shepard" /&gt; "Primary coasts are created by erosion (the wearing away of soil or rock), deposition (the buildup of sediment or sand) or tectonic activity (changes in the structure of the rock and soil because of earthquakes). Many of these coastlines were formed as the sea level rose during the last 18,000 years, submerging river and glacial valleys to form bays and fjords."&lt;ref name=ONR&gt;[http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/ocean/habitats/beaches2.htm Habitats: Beaches - Coasts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426043554/http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/ocean/habitats/beaches2.htm |date=2011-04-26 }} ''[[Office of Naval Research]]''. Retrieved 17 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a primary coast is a [[river delta]], which forms when a river deposits soil and other material as it enters the sea.&lt;ref name=ONR /&gt;
* Secondary coasts are produced by marine processes, such as the action of the sea or by creatures that live in it. Secondary coastlines include [[sea cliff]]s, [[barrier island]]s, [[mud flat]]s, [[coral reef]]s, [[mangrove swamp]]s and [[salt marsh]]es.&lt;ref name=ONR /&gt;

[[File:Elevation.jpg|thumb|260px|left|{{legend|#03FCDE|The global continental shelf, highlighted in cyan, defines the extent of coastal habitats, and occupies 5% of the total world area.}}]]

Continental coastlines usually have a [[continental shelf]], a shelf of relatively shallow water, less than 200 metres deep, which extends 68&amp;nbsp;km on average beyond the coast. Worldwide, continental shelves occupy a total area of about 24 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (9 million sq mi), 8% of the ocean's total area and nearly 5% of the world's total area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/coastal-marine/variable-62.html Continental shelf areas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202232634/http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/coastal-marine/variable-62.html |date=2008-12-02 }} ''Earth trends''. Retrieved 25 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CIAWorld&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html World] The World Factbook, CIA. Retrieved 26 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the continental shelf is usually less than 200 metres deep, it follows that coastal habitats are generally [[Photic zone|photic]], situated in the sunlit [[epipelagic zone]]. This means the conditions for [[photosynthetic]] processes so important for [[primary production]], are available to coastal marine habitats. Because land is nearby, there are large discharges of nutrient rich [[land runoff]] into coastal waters. Further, periodic [[upwelling]]s from the deep ocean can provide cool and nutrient rich currents along the edge of the continental shelf.

As a result, coastal marine life is the most abundant in the world. It is found in [[tidal pool]]s, [[fjord]]s and [[estuaries]], near sandy shores and rocky coastlines, around [[coral reef]]s and on or above the continental shelf. [[Coastal fish]] include small forage fish as well as the larger [[predator fish]] that feed on them. [[Forage fish]] thrive in inshore waters where high [[Primary production|productivity]] results from [[upwelling]] and shoreline run off of nutrients. Some are partial residents that spawn in streams, estuaries and bays, but most complete their life cycle in the zone.&lt;ref name="Moyle572"&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2004, page 572&lt;/ref&gt; There can also be a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] between species that occupy adjacent marine habitats. For example, [[fringing reef]]s just below [[low tide]] level have a mutually beneficial relationship with [[mangrove]] forests at high tide level and [[sea grass]] meadows in between: the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or [[erosion|erode]] the sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and seagrass protect the coral from large influxes of [[silt]], fresh water and [[pollution|pollutants]]. This additional level of variety in the environment is beneficial to many types of coral reef animals, which for example may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Coastal habitats are the most visible marine habitats, but they are not the only important marine habitats. Coastlines run for 380,000 kilometres, and the total volume of the ocean is 1,370 million cu km. This means that for each metre of coast, there is 3.6 cu km of ocean space available somewhere for marine habitats.

[[File:La Désirade.JPG|thumb|right|Waves and currents shape the intertidal shoreline, eroding the softer rocks and transporting and grading loose particles into shingles, sand or mud]]

===Intertidal===
[[Intertidal zone]]s, those areas close to shore, are constantly being exposed and covered by the ocean's [[tides]]. A huge array of life lives within this zone.

Shore habitats range from the upper intertidal zones to the area where land vegetation takes prominence. It can be underwater anywhere from daily to very infrequently. Many species here are scavengers, living off of sea life that is washed up on the shore. Many land animals also make much use of the shore and intertidal habitats. A subgroup of organisms in this habitat bores and grinds exposed rock through the process of [[bioerosion]].

===Sandy shores===
[[File:The White Rocks near Portrush (1) - geograph.org.uk - 785899.jpg|thumb|right|Sandy shores provide shifting homes to many species]]
{{see also|Beach}}

Sandy shores, also called [[beach]]es, are coastal shorelines where [[sand]] accumulates. Waves and currents shift the sand, continually building and eroding the shoreline. [[Longshore current]]s flow parallel to the beaches, making waves break obliquely on the sand. These currents transport large amounts of sand along coasts, forming [[Spit (landform)|spits]], [[barrier island]]s and [[tombolo]]s. Longshore currents also commonly create [[offshore bar]]s, which give beaches some stability by reducing erosion.&lt;ref name="Habitats: Beaches - Characteristics"&gt;[http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/ocean/habitats/beaches1.htm Habitats: Beaches - Characteristics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526121836/http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/ocean/habitats/beaches1.htm |date=2011-05-26 }} ''[[Office of Naval Research]]''. Retrieved 17 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandy shores are full of life, The grains of sand host [[diatom]]s, [[bacteria]] and other microscopic creatures. Some fish and turtles return to certain beaches and [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] eggs in the sand. Birds habitat beaches, like [[gull]]s, [[loon]]s, [[sandpiper]]s, [[tern]]s and [[pelican]]s. [[Aquatic mammal]]s, such sea lions, recuperate on them. [[Clam]]s, [[Littorinidae|periwinkle]]s, [[crab]]s, [[shrimp]], [[starfish]] and [[sea urchin]]s are found on most beaches.&lt;ref name="Habitats: Beaches - Animal &amp; Plant Life"&gt;[http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/ocean/habitats/beaches3.htm Habitats: Beaches - Animal &amp; Plant Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526121525/http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/ocean/habitats/beaches3.htm |date=2011-05-26 }} ''[[Office of Naval Research]]''.

Sand is a [[sediment]] made from small grains or [[Particle (ecology)|particles]] with diameters between about 60&amp;nbsp;µm and 2&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;Wentworth CK (1922) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/30063207 "A scale of grade and class terms for clastic sediments"] ''J. Geology,'' '''30''': 377–392.&lt;/ref&gt; Mud (see [[Marine habitats#Mudflats|mudflats]] below) is a sediment made from particles finer than sand. This small particle size means that mud particles tend to stick together, whereas sand particles do not. Mud is not easily shifted by waves and currents, and when it dries out, cakes into a solid. By contrast, sand is easily shifted by waves and currents, and when sand dries out it can be blown in the wind, accumulating into shifting [[sand dune]]s. Beyond the high tide mark, if the beach is low-lying, the wind can form rolling hills of sand dunes. Small dunes shift and reshape under the influence of the wind while larger dunes stabilise the sand with vegetation.&lt;ref name="Habitats: Beaches - Characteristics" /&gt;

Ocean processes grade loose sediments to [[Particle size (grain size)|particle sizes]] other than sand, such as [[gravel]] or [[Cobble (geology)|cobble]]s. Waves breaking on a beach can leave a [[berm]], which is a raised ridge of coarser pebbles or sand, at the high tide mark. [[Shingle beach]]es are made of particles larger than sand, such as cobbles, or small stones. These beaches make poor habitats. Little life survives because the stones are churned and pounded together by waves and currents.&lt;ref name="Habitats: Beaches - Characteristics" /&gt;

===Rocky shores===
[[File:Porto Covo February 2009-2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tidepool]]s on rocky shores make turbulent habitats for many forms of marine life]]
{{see also|Rocky shore|Tidal pool}}

The relative solidity of [[rocky shore]]s seems to give them a permanence compared to the shifting nature of sandy shores. This apparent stability is not real over even quite short geological time scales, but it is real enough over the short life of an organism. In contrast to sandy shores, plants and animals can anchor themselves to the rocks.&lt;ref name="Tour of Rocky Shoreline Habitats"&gt;[http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/rocky_shores.htm Tour of Rocky Shoreline Habitats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524105825/http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/rocky_shores.htm |date=2011-05-24 }} ''Marietta College''. Retrieved 17 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition can develop for the rocky spaces. For example, [[barnacle]]s can compete successfully on open intertidal rock faces to the point where the rock surface is covered with them. Barnacles resist desiccation and grip well to exposed rock faces. However, in the crevices of the same rocks, the inhabitants are different. Here [[mussel]]s can be the successful species, secured to the rock with their [[byssal]] threads.&lt;ref name="Tour of Rocky Shoreline Habitats" /&gt;

Rocky and sandy coasts are vulnerable because humans find them attractive and want to live near them. An increasing proportion of the humans live by the coast, putting pressure on coastal habitats.&lt;ref name="Tour of Rocky Shoreline Habitats" /&gt;

===Mudflats===
[[File:Bnstiltpair.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mudflat]]s become temporary habitats for [[Bird migration|migrating birds]]]]
{{See also|Bay mud}}

[[Mudflat]]s are coastal wetlands that form when mud is deposited by tides or rivers. They are found in sheltered areas such as [[bays]], [[bayous]], [[lagoons]], and [[estuaries]]. Mudflats may be viewed [[geologic]]ally as exposed layers of [[bay mud]], resulting from deposition of [[estuarine]] [[silt]]s, [[clay]]s and marine animal [[detritus]].  Most of the sediment within a mudflat is within the [[intertidal zone]], and thus the flat is submerged and exposed approximately twice daily.

Mudflats are typically important regions for wildlife, supporting a large population, although levels of biodiversity are not particularly high. They are of particular importance to [[migratory bird]]s. In the [[United Kingdom]] mudflats have been classified as a [[Biodiversity Action Plan]] priority habitat.

===Mangrove and salt marshes===
[[File:Sundarban mangrove.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mangrove]]s provide nurseries for fish ]]
{{see also|Mangrove|Ecological values of mangrove|Salt marsh}}

[[Mangrove swamp]]s and [[salt marsh]]es form important coastal habitats in tropical and temperate areas respectively.

Mangroves are species of shrubs and medium size trees that grow in [[saline water|saline]] coastal sediment habitats in the [[tropics]] and [[subtropics]] &amp;ndash; mainly between [[latitude]]s {{formatnum:25}}° N and {{formatnum:25}}° S. The saline conditions tolerated by various species range from [[brackish water]], through pure [[seawater]] (30 to 40 [[Salinity|ppt]]), to water concentrated by [[evaporation]] to over twice the salinity of ocean seawater (up to 90 ppt).&lt;ref name="Mathias"&gt;[http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/worldvegetation/marinewetlands/mangal/index.html Mangal (Mangrove). ''World Vegetation''. Mildred E.

The term "mangrove" is used generally to cover all of these species, and it can be used narrowly to cover just mangrove trees of the genus ''[[Rhizophora]]''.

Mangroves form a distinct characteristic saline [[woodland]] or [[shrubland]] habitat, called a ''mangrove swamp'' or ''mangrove forest'''.&lt;ref name="Hogarth"&gt;Hogarth, Peter J. (1999) ''The Biology of Mangroves'' Oxford University Press, Oxford, England, &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;What page?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; {{ISBN|0-19-850222-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mangrove swamps are found in [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional]] coastal environments, where fine sediments (often with high organic content) collect in areas protected from high-energy wave action.  Mangroves dominate three quarters of tropical coastlines.&lt;ref name=NHMI/&gt;

===Estuaries===
[[File:Conwy Estuary - geograph.org.uk - 575854.jpg|thumb|right|[[Estuaries]] occur when rivers flow into a coastal bay or inlet. They are nutrient rich and have a transition zone which moves from freshwater to saltwater.]]

An [[estuary]] is a partly enclosed [[coastal]] body of [[water]] with one or more [[river]]s or [[stream]]s flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open [[sea]].&lt;ref name="Pritchard"&gt;Pritchard, D. W. (1967) ''What is an estuary: physical viewpoint''. p. 3–5 ''in:'' G. H. Lauf (ed.) ''Estuaries'', A.A.A.S. Publ. No. 83, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; Estuaries form a transition zone between river environments and ocean environments and are subject to both marine influences, such as tides, waves, and the influx of saline water; and riverine influences, such as flows of fresh water and sediment. The inflow of both seawater and freshwater provide high levels of nutrients in both the water column and sediment, making estuaries among the most productive natural habitats in the world.&lt;ref name="McLusky"&gt;McLusky, D.S. and Elliott, M. (2004) "The Estuarine Ecosystem: ecology, threats and management." New York: Oxford University Press Inc. {{ISBN|0-19-852508-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most estuaries were formed by the flooding of river-eroded or glacially scoured valleys when sea level began to rise about 10,000-12,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Wolanski"&gt;Wolanski, E. (2007) "Estuarine Ecohydrology." Amsterdam, The Netherlands: Elsevier. {{ISBN|978-0-444-53066-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are amongst the most heavily populated areas throughout the world, with about 60% of the world’s population living along estuaries and the coast. As a result, estuaries are suffering degradation by many factors, including sedimentation from soil erosion from deforestation; overgrazing and other poor farming practices; overfishing; drainage and filling of wetlands; eutrophication due to excessive nutrients from sewage and animal wastes; pollutants including heavy metals, PCBs, radionuclides and hydrocarbons from sewage inputs; and diking or damming for flood control or water diversion.&lt;ref name="Wolanski"/&gt;

Estuaries provide habitats for a large number of organisms and support very high productivity. Estuaries provide habitats for [[salmon]] and [[sea trout]] nurseries,&lt;ref&gt;Bronwyn M. Gillanders, [http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps2003/247/m247p281.pdf Evidence of connectivity between juvenile and adult habitats for mobile marine fauna: an important component of nurseries]. 2003. ''Marine Ecology Progress Series''&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Bird migration|migratory]] bird populations.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer A. Gill, [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v412/n6845/abs/412436a0.html The buffer effect and large-scale population regulation in migratory birds]. 2001. ''Nature'' 412, 436-438&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the main characteristics of estuarine life are the variability in [[salinity]] and [[sedimentation]]. Many species of [[fish]] and [[invertebrate]]s have various methods to control or conform to the shifts in salt concentrations and are termed [[osmoconformer]]s and [[osmoregulator]]s. Many animals also [[burrowing|burrow]] to avoid [[predation]] and to live in the more stable sedimental environment. However, large numbers of bacteria are found within the sediment which have a very high oxygen demand. This reduces the levels of oxygen within the sediment often resulting in partially [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] conditions, which can be further exacerbated by limited water flux. [[Phytoplankton]] are key primary producers in estuaries. They move with the water bodies and can be flushed in and out with the [[tide]]s. Their productivity is largely dependent on the [[turbidity]] of the water. The main phytoplankton present are [[diatoms]] and [[dinoflagellates]] which are abundant in the sediment.

===Kelp forests===
{{further|Kelp forest}}
[[File:Kelp forest.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kelp forest]]s provide habitat for many marine organisms]]

[[Kelp forest]]s are underwater areas with a high density of [[kelp]]. They form some of the most productive and dynamic [[ecosystem]]s on Earth.&lt;ref name="Mann (1973)"&gt;Mann, K.H. 1973. Seaweeds: their productivity and strategy for growth. Science 182: 975-981.&lt;/ref&gt;   Smaller areas of anchored kelp are called ''kelp beds''. Kelp forests occur worldwide throughout [[temperate]] and [[polar region|polar]] coastal oceans.&lt;ref name="Mann (1973)"/&gt;

Kelp forests provide a unique three-dimensional habitat for marine organisms and are a source for understanding many ecological processes. Over the last century, they have been the focus of extensive research, particularly in [[Trophic dynamics|trophic]] ecology, and continue to provoke important ideas that are relevant beyond this unique ecosystem. For example, kelp forests can influence coastal [[oceanographic]] patterns&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, G.A. and C.D. Winant. 1983. Effect of a kelp forest on coastal currents. Continental Shelf Report 2: 75-80.&lt;/ref&gt; and provide many [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref name="Steneck 2002"&gt;Steneck, R.S., M.H. Graham, B.J. Bourque, D. Corbett, J.M. Erlandson, J.A. Estes and M.J. Tegner. 2002. Kelp forest ecosystems: biodiversity, stability, resilience and future. Environmental Conservation 29: 436-459.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, humans have contributed to kelp forest degradation. Of particular concern are the effects of [[overfishing]] nearshore ecosystems, which can release [[herbivores]] from their normal population regulation and result in the over-grazing of kelp and other algae.&lt;ref name="Sala1998"&gt;Sala, E., C.F. Bourdouresque and M. Harmelin-Vivien. 1998. Fishing, trophic cascades, and the structure of algal assemblages: evaluation of an old but untested paradigm. Oikos 82: 425-439.&lt;/ref&gt; This can rapidly result in transitions to barren landscapes where relatively few species persist.&lt;ref name="Dayton 1985a"&gt;Dayton, P.K. 1985a. Ecology of kelp communities. Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics 16: 215-245.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently considered an [[ecosystem engineer]], kelp provides a physical substrate and habitat for kelp forest communities.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, C.G., J. H. Lawton and M. Shachak. 1997. Positive and negative effects of organisms as physical ecosystem engineers. Ecology 78: 1946-1957.&lt;/ref&gt; In algae (Kingdom: [[Protista]]), the body of an individual organism is known as a [[thallus]] rather than as a plant (Kingdom: [[Plantae]]). The morphological structure of a kelp thallus is defined by three basic structural units:&lt;ref name="Dayton 1985a"/&gt;
:* The [[holdfast]] is a root-like mass that anchors the thallus to the sea floor, though unlike true roots it is not responsible for absorbing and delivering nutrients to the rest of the thallus;
:* The [[Stipe (botany)|stipe]] is analogous to a plant stalk, extending vertically from the holdfast and providing a support framework for other morphological features;
:* The [[fronds]] are leaf- or blade-like attachments extending from the stipe, sometimes along its full length, and are the sites of nutrient uptake and photosynthetic activity.
In addition, many kelp species have [[pneumatocyst]]s, or gas-filled bladders, usually located at the base of fronds near the stipe. These structures provide the necessary buoyancy for kelp to maintain an upright position in the water column.

The environmental factors necessary for kelp to survive include hard substrate (usually rock), high nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus), and light (minimum annual [[irradiance]] dose &gt; 50 E m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Druehl 1981"&gt;Druehl, L.D. 1981. The distribution of Laminariales in the North Pacific with reference to environmental influences. Proceedings of the International Congress on Systematic Evolution and Biology 2: 248-256.&lt;/ref&gt;). Especially productive kelp forests tend to be associated with areas of significant oceanographic [[upwelling]], a process that delivers cool nutrient-rich water from depth to the ocean’s [[mixed layer|mixed surface layer]].&lt;ref name="Druehl 1981"/&gt; Water flow and turbulence facilitate nutrient assimilation across kelp fronds throughout the water column.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, W.N. 1980. Effect of boundary layer transport on the fixation of carbon by the giant kelp ''Macrocystis pyrifera''. Marine Biology 56: 103-110.&lt;/ref&gt; Water clarity affects the depth to which sufficient light can be transmitted. In ideal conditions, giant kelp (''Macrocystis spp.'') can grow as much as 30-60 centimetres vertically per day. Some species such as ''Nereocystis'' are [[annual plant|annual]] while others like ''Eisenia'' are [[perennial plant|perennial]], living for more than 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Steneck, R.S. and M.N. Dethier. 1994. A functional group approach to the structure of algal-dominated communities. Oikos 69: 476-498.&lt;/ref&gt; In perennial kelp forests, maximum growth rates occur during upwelling months (typically spring and summer) and die-backs correspond to reduced nutrient availability, shorter photoperiods and increased storm frequency.&lt;ref name="Dayton 1985a"/&gt;

===Seagrass meadows===
[[File:White-spotted puffer.jpg|thumb|right|[[White-spotted puffer]]s like living in seagrass areas]]

[[Seagrass]]es are [[flowering plant]]s from one of four plant families which grow in marine environments. They are called ''seagrasses'' because the leaves are long and narrow and are very often green, and because the plants often grow in large meadows which look like grassland. Since seagrasses [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] and are submerged, they must grow submerged in the [[photic zone]], where there is enough sunlight. For this reason, most occur in shallow and sheltered coastal waters anchored in sand or mud bottoms.

Seagrasses form extensive beds or meadows, which can be either monospecific (made up of one species) or multispecific (where more than one species co-exist). Seagrass beds make highly diverse and productive [[ecosystem]]s. They are home to [[phylum|phyla]] such as juvenile and adult fish, [[Epiphyte|epiphytic]] and free-living [[Seaweed|macroalgae]] and [[Microphyte|microalgae]], [[mollusk]]s, [[bristle worm]]s, and [[nematode]]s.  Few species were originally considered to feed directly on seagrass [[leaf|leaves]] (partly because of their low nutritional content), but scientific [[review]]s and improved working methods have shown that seagrass [[Herbivore|herbivory]] is a highly important link in the food chain, with hundreds of species feeding on seagrasses worldwide, including [[green turtle]]s, [[dugong]]s, [[manatee]]s, [[fish]], [[Goose|geese]], [[swan]]s, [[sea urchin]]s and [[crab]]s.

Seagrasses are [[ecosystem engineer]]s in the sense that they partly create their own habitat. The leaves slow down water-currents increasing [[sedimentation]], and the seagrass [[root]]s and [[rhizome]]s stabilize the seabed. Their importance to associated species is mainly due to provision of shelter (through their three-dimensional structure in the water column), and due to their extraordinarily high rate of [[primary production]]. As a result, seagrasses provide coastal zones with [[ecosystem services]], such as [[fishing ground]]s, [[Wind wave|wave]] protection, [[oxygen]] production and protection against coastal [[erosion]]. Seagrass meadows account for 15% of the ocean’s total carbon storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Coral reefs ===
[[File:Maldivesfish2.jpg|thumb|right]]
{{Main|Coral reef}}

[[Reef]]s comprise some of the densest and most diverse habitats in the world. The best-known types of reefs are [[tropical]] [[coral reef]]s which exist in most tropical waters; however, reefs can also exist in cold water. Reefs are built up by [[coral]]s and other [[calcium]]-depositing animals, usually on top of a rocky outcrop on the ocean floor. Reefs can also grow on other surfaces, which has made it possible to create [[artificial reef]]s. Coral reefs also support a huge community of life, including the corals themselves, their symbiotic [[zooxanthellae]], tropical fish and many other organisms.

Much attention in marine biology is focused on coral reefs and the [[El Niño]] weather phenomenon. In 1998, coral reefs experienced the most severe mass bleaching events on record, when vast expanses of reefs across the world died because sea surface temperatures rose well above normal.&lt;ref&gt;NOAA (1998) Record-breaking coral bleaching occurred in tropics this year.

==Open ocean==
[[File:Earth elevation histogram 2.svg|thumb|left|Elevation-area graph showing the proportion of land area at given heights and the proportion of ocean area at given depths]]
{{See also|Pelagic fish}}

The open ocean is relatively unproductive because of a lack of nutrients, yet because it is so vast, it has more overall [[primary production]] than any other marine habitat. Only about 10 percent of marine species live in the open ocean. But among them are the largest and fastest of all marine animals, as well as the animals that dive the deepest and migrate the longest. In the depths lurk animal that, to our eyes, appear hugely alien.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/blue_planet/open_ocean/ Blue Planet: Open ocean] ''WWF'. Retrieved 17 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surface waters===
[[File:Starr 061214-2478 Chenopodium oahuense.jpg|thumb|right|In the open ocean, sunlit surface [[epipelagic]] waters get enough light for photosynthesis, but there are often not enough nutrients. As a result, large areas contain little life apart from migrating animals.&lt;ref name=sunlit /&gt;]]

The surface waters are sunlit. The waters down to about 200 metres are said to be in the [[epipelagic zone]]. Enough sunlight enters the epipelagic zone to allow [[photosynthesis]] by [[phytoplankton]]. The epipelagic zone is usually low in nutrients. This partially because the organic debris produced in the zone, such as excrement and dead animals, sink to the depths and are lost to the upper zone. Photosynthesis can happen only if both sunlight and nutrients are present.&lt;ref name=sunlit&gt;[http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/blue_planet/open_ocean/surface_waters/ Ocean ecology: sunlit surface waters] ''WWF'. Retrieved 17 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some places, like at the edge of continental shelves, nutrients can [[upwell]] from the ocean depth, or [[land runoff]] can be distributed by storms and ocean currents. In these areas, given that both sunlight and nutrients are now present, phytoplankton can rapidly establish itself, multiplying so fast that the water turns green from the chlorophyll, resulting in an [[algal bloom]]. These nutrient rich surface waters are among the most biologically productive in the world, supporting billions of tonnes of [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]].&lt;ref name=sunlit /&gt;

"Phytoplankton are eaten by [[zooplankton]] - small animals which, like phytoplankton, drift in the ocean currents. The most abundant zooplankton species are [[copepod]]s and [[krill]]: tiny [[crustacean]]s that are the most numerous animals on Earth. Other types of zooplankton include [[jelly fish]] and the [[larvae]] of fish, [[marine worm]]s, [[starfish]], and other marine organisms".&lt;ref name=sunlit /&gt; In turn, the zooplankton are eaten by [[filter feeding|filter-feeding]] animals, including some [[seabird]]s, small [[forage fish]] like herrings and sardines, [[whale shark]]s, [[manta ray]]s, and the largest animal in the world, the [[blue whale]]. Yet again, moving up the [[foodchain]], the small forage fish are in turn eaten by larger predators, such as tuna, marlin, sharks, large squid, seabirds, dolphins, and [[toothed whale]]s.&lt;ref name=sunlit /&gt;

===Deep sea===
[[File:Pelagiczone.svg|thumb|160px|left|Scale diagram of the layers of the pelagic zone]]
{{see also|Deep sea|Deep sea communities}}

The [[deep sea]] starts at the [[aphotic zone]], the point where sunlight loses most of its energy in the water. Many life forms that live at these depths have the ability to create their own light a unique evolution known as [[bio-luminescence]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In the deep ocean, the waters extend far below the epipelagic zone, and support very different types of pelagic life forms adapted to living in these deeper zones.&lt;ref name="Moyle585"&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2004, page 585&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the [[aphotic zone]]'s energy is supplied by the open ocean in the form of [[detritus]]. In deep water, [[marine snow]] is a continuous shower of mostly organic detritus falling from the upper layers of the water column. Its origin lies in activities within the productive [[photic zone]]. Marine snow includes dead or dying [[plankton]], [[protist]]s ([[diatom]]s), fecal matter, sand, soot and other inorganic dust. The "snowflakes" grow over time and may reach several centimetres in diameter, travelling for weeks before reaching the ocean floor. However, most organic components of marine snow are consumed by [[microbe]]s, [[zooplankton]] and other filter-feeding animals within the first 1,000 metres of their journey, that is, within the epipelagic zone. In this way marine snow may be considered the foundation of deep-sea [[mesopelagic]] and [[benthic]] [[ecosystem]]s: As sunlight cannot reach them, deep-sea organisms rely heavily on marine snow as an energy source.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Some deep-sea pelagic groups, such as the [[lanternfish]], [[ridgehead]], [[marine hatchetfish]], and [[Phosichthyidae|lightfish]] families are sometimes termed ''pseudoceanic'' because, rather than having an even distribution in open water, they occur in significantly higher abundances around structural oases, notably [[seamount]]s and over [[continental slope]]s. The phenomenon is explained by the likewise abundance of prey species which are also attracted to the structures.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The fish in the different pelagic and deep water benthic zones are physically structured, and behave in ways, that differ markedly from each other. Groups of coexisting species within each zone all seem to operate in similar ways, such as the small mesopelagic [[Diel vertical migration|vertically migrating]] plankton-feeders, the bathypelagic [[anglerfish]]es, and the deep water benthic [[rattail]]s. "&lt;ref name="Moyle591"&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2004, p. 591&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Acanthopterygii|Ray finned]] species, with spiny fins, are rare among deep sea fishes, which suggests that deep sea fish are ancient and so well adapted to their environment that invasions by more modern fishes have been unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Haedrich1996"&gt;Haedrich RL (1996) [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119203565/abstract "Deep-water fishes: evolution and adaptation in the earth's largest living spaces"] ''Journal of Fish Biology'' '''49'''(sA):40-53.&lt;/ref&gt; The few ray fins that do exist are mainly in the [[Beryciformes]] and [[Lampriformes]], which are also ancient forms. Most deep sea pelagic fishes belong to their own orders, suggesting a long evolution in deep sea environments. In contrast, deep water benthic species, are in orders that include many related shallow water fishes.&lt;ref name="Moyle586"&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2004, page 586&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pelican eel|umbrella mouth gulper]] is a deep sea eel with an enormous loosely hinged mouth. It can open its mouth wide enough to swallow a fish much larger than itself, and then expand its stomach to accommodate its catch.&lt;ref name=EoF&gt;{{cite book |editor=Paxton, J.R.W.N.|author= McCosker, John E.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|page= 90|isbn= 0-12-547665-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vents and seeps===
[[File:Explorer Ridge Zooarium chimney.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zooid|Zooarium]] chimney provides a habitat for vent biota]]

[[Hydrothermal vent]]s along the [[mid-ocean ridge]] spreading centers act as [[oasis|oases]], as do their opposites, [[cold seeps]]. Such places support unique [[marine biome]]s and many new [[marine microorganism]]s and other lifeforms have been discovered at these locations.

===Trenches===
The deepest recorded [[oceanic trench]]es measure to date is the [[Mariana Trench]], near the [[Philippines]], in the [[Pacific Ocean]] at 10,924&amp;nbsp;m (35,838&amp;nbsp;ft). At such depths, [[water pressure]] is extreme and there is no sunlight, but some life still exists. A white [[flatfish]], a shrimp and a jellyfish were seen by the American crew of the [[bathyscaphe]] ''[[Bathyscaphe Trieste|Trieste]]'' when it dove to the bottom in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjsonline.com/watches/articles/0022_3.shtml Seven Miles Down: The Story of The Bathyscaph Trieste.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202144233/http://bjsonline.com/watches/articles/0022_3.shtml |date=2007-02-02 }}, ''Rolex Deep Sea Special'', January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seamounts===
Marine life also flourishes around [[seamount]]s that rise from the depths, where fish and other sea life congregate to spawn and feed.

'''Men's studies''', often called '''men and masculinities''' in academic settings, is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[academic field]] devoted to topics concerning [[men]], [[masculinity]], [[feminism]], [[gender]], and [[politics]]. It draws upon [[feminist theory]] in order to analyze different ideologies  having to do with masculinity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allan|first=Jonathan | title = Phallic affect, or why men's rights activists have feelings | journal = [[Men and Masculinities]] | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 22&amp;ndash;41 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/1097184X15574338 |date= April 2016 |url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1097184X15574338 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and through such analysis to examine the multiple ''masculinities'' contained in the idea of masculinity itself. Men's studies also academically examine what it means to be a man in contemporary society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= Bennett|first=Jessica |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/fashion/masculinities-studies-stonybrook-michael-kimmel.html?_r=0|title=A master's degree in...masculinity?|date=August 8, 2015|work=[[New York Times]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
As a relatively new field of study, men's studies was formed largely in response to, and as a critique of, an emerging [[men's rights]] movement, and as such, has been taught in academic settings only since the 1970s.  In many universities, men's studies is a correlation to [[women's studies]] or part of a larger [[gender studies]] program, and as such its faculty tends to be sympathetic to, or engaged in, advocacy of [[feminist]] politics. Men's studies works with feminist studies to question the relationship that men have with patriarchal power throughout different temporal and historical times.&lt;ref name="Gurfinkel"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Gurfinkel|first=Helena|title=Masculinity studies: what is it, and why would a feminist care?|url=https://siuewmst.wordpress.com/2012/12/06/masculinity-studies-what-is-it-and-why-would-a-feminist-care/|website=siuewmst.wordpress.com|publisher=[[Southern Illinois University|SIUE]] Women's Studies Program via [[WordPress]]|date=December 6, 2012|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of plural ''masculinities'' was proposed by [[R.W. Connell]] in her influential book ''Masculinities'' (1995);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R. W. | author-link = R.W. Connell | title = Masculinities | publisher = Polity Press | location = Cambridge, UK | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780745614694 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus the academic field is today often known as ''men and masculinities''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aboim | first = Sofia | title = Plural masculinities: the remaking of the self in private life | page = 5 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2016 | isbn = 9781315600901 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In contrast to the discipline of [[masculine psychology]], men's studies programs and courses often include contemporary discussions of men's rights, [[feminist theory]], [[queer theory]], [[matriarchy]], [[patriarchy]], and more generally, what proponents describe as the social, historical, and cultural constructions of [[Man|men]]. They often discuss the issues surrounding [[male privilege]], seen as evolving into more subtle forms rather than disappearing in the modern era.

== Construction of Masculinity ==
When pursuing masculinity studies, many scholars began explaining how masculinity is a [[Social constructionism|social construction]]. [[Michael Kimmel]], a prominent scholar in the field of masculinity studies, writes extensively on manhood and its definition. He does this starting with the 19th century in America, when masculinity began to be defined through proving oneself as a man. As a result, the political arena, workplace, family, and whole world was changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Kimmel |editor1-first=Michael | editor-link = Michael Kimmel |title= The politics of manhood |publisher= [[Temple University Press]] |location= Philadelphia |isbn= 9781566393652 |year=1995 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ksbyvqKZL2MC }}&lt;/ref&gt; This change constructed "[[hegemonic masculinity]]", or the "practice that allowed men's dominance over women to continue",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Laurie|first=Timothy | title = Masculinity studies and the jargon of strategy: ''hegemony, tautology, sense'' | journal = [[Angelaki|Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities]], special issue: Geophilosophies of masculinity: remapping gender, aesthetics and knowledge | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 13&amp;ndash;30 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017373 | date = 2015 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017373 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.academia.edu/10912537/Masculinity_Studies_and_the_Jargon_of_Strategy_Hegemony_Tautology_Sense Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; or the stereotypical definition of masculinity that many think of initially. In unpacking masculinity, the construction is understood [[Intersectionality|intersectionally]], looking at the historical, cultural, temporal, political, and psychological ways in which the definition of masculinity is created.&lt;ref name="Gurfinkel" /&gt; Because of the intersectional lens used to study masculinity, it becomes clear that there are multiple masculinities because of the various experiences that different histories, cultures, and times produce.

== Organizations ==
The [[American Men's Studies Association]] (AMSA) traces the roots of an organized field of men's studies to the early 1980s and the work of scholars involved in an [[Sexism|anti-sexist]] organization called the Men's Studies Task Group (MSTG) of the National Organization for Changing Men (NOCM) which included Martin Acker, Shepherd Bliss, [[Harry Brod]], Sam Femiano, Martin Fiebert, and [[Michael Messner]]. However, men's studies classes also pre-date NOCM, and a small number were taught in various colleges across the United States throughout the 1970s. Conferences such as the Men and Masculinity conferences sparked the creation of newsletters and journals, such as the ''Men's Studies Newsletter'' (and its successor, ''Men’s Studies Review''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Men’s Studies Review (journal) | publisher = American Men's Studies Association (AMSA) | location = Harriman, Tennessee | lccn = 93648850 | issn = 0890-9741}}&lt;/ref&gt; pertaining to the growing field of men's studies. These became prime resources for those interested in the field, providing news, bibliographies, and firsthand experiences. Following the newsletters and journals came the [[Men's Studies Press]], thus moving the academic field of masculinity studies to books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Doyle|first=James.

When NOCM changed its name to the [[National Organization for Men Against Sexism]] (NOMAS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.nomas.org/ | website = nomas.org | publisher = [[National Organization for Men Against Sexism]] (NOMAS) }}&lt;/ref&gt; the MSTG became the Men's Studies Association (MSA). The MSA was an explicitly pro-feminist group, and those who felt this was too constraining split away several years later to form the American Men's Studies Association (AMSA).

== Criticism ==
A range of criticisms have been made of the separation between "men's studies" and "gender studies". For example, Timothy Laurie and Anna Hickey-Moody insist that "[any] atomisation of masculinity studies as distinct from gender studies, feminist inquiry or queer studies must be understood as provisional and hazardous rather than as the result of absolute differences in the phenomena being investigated or expertise required".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laurie | first1 = Timothy | last2 = Hickey-Moody | first2 = Anna | title = Geophilosophies of masculinity: remapping gender, aesthetics and knowledge | journal = [[Angelaki|Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities]], special issue: Geophilosophies of masculinity: remapping gender, aesthetics and knowledge | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;10 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017359 | date = 2015 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017359 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.academia.edu/10912564 Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 Joyce E. Canaan and Christine Griffin described their suspicions of The New Men's Studies (TNMS): the emergence of conferences and books on men and masculinity during a time of political and financial cuts to further education and higher education in the UK, "Is it a coincidence that TNMS is being constructed in the present context as a source of potential research, publishing deals, and (even more) jobs for the already-well-paid boys holding prestigious positions?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Canaan | first1 = Joyce E. | last2 = Griffin | first2 = Christine | chapter = The new men's studies: part of the problem or part of the solution | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yC5HBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA208 | editor-last1 = Morgan | editor-first1 = D.

==Work and care==
Men's studies are notably concerned with challenging gendered arrangements of work and care, and the male breadwinner role, and policies are increasingly targeting men as fathers, as a tool of changing gender relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bjørnholt | first = Margunn | authorlink1= Margunn Bjørnholt | title = Changing men, changing times; fathers and sons from an experimental gender equality study | journal = [[The Sociological Review]] | volume = 62 | issue = 2  | pages = 295&amp;ndash;315 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1111/1467-954X.12156 | date = May 2014 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-954X.12156 }} [http://www.margunnbjornholt.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Changing-men-changing-times-fathers-and-sons-from-an-experimental-gender-equality-study.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Municipal annexation''' is a process by which a municipality expands its boundaries into adjacent areas not already incorporated into the municipality. This has been a common response of cities to [[urbanization]] in neighboring areas. It may be done because the neighboring urban areas seek municipal services or because a city seeks control over its [[suburb]]s or neighboring unincorporated areas.

In the [[United States]], all local governments are considered "creatures of the state" according to [[John Forrest Dillon#Dillon's Rule|Dillon's Rule]], which resulted from the work of [[John Forrest Dillon]] on the law of [[municipal corporation]]s. Dillon's Rule implies, among other things, that the boundaries of any [[jurisdiction]] falling under state government can be modified by state government action. For this reason, examples of municipal annexation are distinct from [[annexation]]s involving [[sovereign state]]s.

==Unusual annexations==

===Crossing county lines: Atlanta ===
In 1909 the city of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], then located only in [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]], annexed part of neighboring [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]], from which Fulton County had originally been divided. Because the original county borders retain legal significance, the expansion into two counties generated some problems, such as when police arrest suspects on charges set forth in Georgia [[U.S. state|state]] law and city police must determine to which county's jail they must be taken.

===Merging by referendum: New York===
Following referenda in 1874 and 1895, the [[City of Greater New York|City of New York]] annexed portions of southern [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and in 1898, after another referendum, the city annexed all of [[Brooklyn|Kings]], [[Staten Island|Richmond]], and most of [[Queens]] counties. The annexed portion of Westchester County is now [[The Bronx|Bronx]] county; the unannexed portion of Queens County is now Nassau County.  As a result, Westchester County does not currently include any portion of the City of New York and Queens County is entirely within the City of New York.

==Shoestring annexation==

A "shoestring annexation" is a term used for an annexation by a [[city]], [[town]] or other [[municipality]] in which it acquires new territory that is contiguous to the existing territory but is only connected to it by a thin strip of land.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9vQTxyeb04EC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=Shoestring+annexation&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U0HmVkonY3ZzHjCa3Bca9wN5w9cIg#PPA46,M1 Annexation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zxUVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA363&amp;dq=Shoestring+annexation&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a A History of California and an Extended History of Los Angeles]&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes called a "flagpole annexation" because the territory resembles a flagpole, in which the connection is the "pole" and the annexed territory the "flag".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.state.co.us/owenspress/11-06-01a.htm |title=Flagpole annexation in Colorado |access-date=2010-09-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020101213353/http://www.state.co.us/owenspress/11-06-01a.htm |archive-date=2002-01-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons===
In some states, municipalities are prohibited from annexing land not directly connected to their existing territory.  A shoestring or flagpole annexation allows the municipality to do so.

Such annexations are sometimes used when a municipality seeks to acquire [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] developed land, such as a newly built [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]] separated from it by undeveloped open space. They may also be used when a municipality desires to annex a commercial or industrial area without taking over intervening residential areas, so as to collect tax revenues from the businesses or industry without having to provide services (such as [[electricity]] and [[waste|garbage]] collection) to residents. Such uses of the technique are often criticized and derided as a form of [[gerrymandering]], and have in fact been used for the purpose of manipulating vote distribution among election precincts and districts.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

A related strategy is called strip annexation, which involves annexing a narrow strip that encloses a large block of unincorporated land. Strip annexation was widely used by the municipalities of the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]] during the 1970s to preemptively gain control of large areas of land before other municipalities, without having to annex more than a thin strip surrounding a large so-called [[county island]]. The strip protected the county island from being annexed by other municipalities, thus giving the strip-annexing municipality the ability to slowly annex portions of the county island over time. One such annexation by [[Chandler, Arizona|Chandler]] in 1974 spurred nearby [[Gilbert, Arizona|Gilbert]] to create the largest county island to date by annexing a strip no more than 200 feet wide that enclosed 51 square miles of unincorporated [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]]. The annexation was challenged in court and, although found legal, eventually led to legislation in 1980 outlawing strip annexation. Some municipalities rushed to annex before the law took effect, such as [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], which annexed a 10 foot wide strip enclosing an 86 square mile county island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://scholarworks.umass.edu/econ_workingpaper/55/ |title= Border Wars: Tax Revenues, Annexation, and Urban Growth in Phoenix |last= Heim |first= Carol E. |publisher= University of Massachusetts Amherst |pages= 18–27, 54 |accessdate= 27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===

{{norefs|section|date = March 2018}}

===Port of LA===
The [[Port of Los Angeles]] together with the [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]], [[Wilmington, Los Angeles, California|Wilmington]] and [[Harbor City, Los Angeles, California|Harbor City]] neighborhoods of [[Los Angeles]], are connected to the main part of the city by what is called locally the "[[Harbor Gateway, Los Angeles, California|Shoestring Strip]]" between [[Figueroa Street]] and [[Vermont Avenue]] and between [[Western Avenue, Los Angeles, California|Western]] and [[Normandie Avenue|Normandie]] avenues to the south.

===O'Hare Airport===
[[O'Hare Airport]] is municipally connected to the city of [[Chicago]] via a narrow strip of land, approximately 200 feet wide, along Foster Avenue from the [[Des Plaines river]] to the airport. This land was annexed in the 1950s to assure the airport was contiguous with the city to keep it under city control.  The strip is bounded on the north by [[Rosemont, Illinois|Rosemont]] and the south by [[Schiller Park, Illinois|Schiller Park]].&lt;ref&gt;http://egov.cityofchicago.org/webportal/COCWebPortal/COC_ATTACH/41st.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allston-Brighton===
The [[Boston]] neighborhoods of [[Allston]] and [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]] were part of an independent town of Brighton before being annexed by Boston.  At the time [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] extended to the [[Charles River]] and separated Boston and Brighton.  As a result, a shoestring annexation was obtained by Boston from Brookline when Brighton joined Boston.  This was made necessary by [[Boston–Brookline annexation debate of 1873|Brookline's refusal to join Boston]] a year before Brighton's annexation.

===South San Diego===
[[South San Diego]], located next to the [[Mexico–United States border]], is physically separated from the rest of [[San Diego]] by the cities of [[National City, California|National City]] and [[Chula Vista]]. A narrow strip of land at the bottom of [[San Diego Bay]] connects these southern neighborhoods with the rest of the city.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15683">In 1938, [[Henry Murray]]  developed a system of [[needs]] as part of his theory of personality, which he called 'personology.' He argued that everyone had a set of universal basic needs, with individual differences on these needs leading to the uniqueness of personality through varying dispositional tendencies for each need; in other words, specific needs are more important to some than to others. In his theory, Murray argues that needs and presses (another component of the theory) acted together to create an internal state of disequilibrium; the individual is then driven to engage in some sort of behavior to reduce the tension. Murray believed that the study of personality should look at the entire person over the course of their lifespan – that people needed to be analysed in terms of complex interactions and whole systems rather than individual parts – and an individual's behaviors, needs and their levels, etc. are all part of that understanding. Murray also argued that there was a biological (specifically neurological) basis for personality and behavior&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Henry A|title=Explorations in Personality|date=1938|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flett|first1=Gordon L|title=Personality theory and research: an international perspective|date=2014|publisher=Wiley Global Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Needs ==

Murray defines a need as a drive that has the potential to prompt a behavior from the person. For example, the need for affiliation may drive a person to join social organization. Needs are often influenced by environmental stimulus or 'presses,' another component of Murray's theory.

Individual differences in levels of needs lead to the uniqueness of a person's personality; in other words, specific needs may be more important to some than to others. According to Murray, human needs are psychogenic in origin, function on an unconscious level, and can play a major role in defining personality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Frustration of these psychogenic needs plays a central role in the origin of [[psychological pain]].&lt;ref name="Shneidman_1996"&gt;{{vcite book | author = Shneidman ES | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = The Suicidal Mind | edition = | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = | year = 1996 | pages =  | isbn = | chapter =  | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=rn4pf7-dca0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+suicidal+mind&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qIGjSw106n&amp;sig=A2b8DvJxC9gwoHPAJiiiEFaqdeU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=N74RUMWMDKjmiwKX8oHIAQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20suicidal%20mind&amp;f=false | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also believed that these needs could be measured by projective tests, specifically one he had developed, known as the [[thematic apperception test]] (TAT). Unlike [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], Murray's needs are not based on a hierarchy; individuals may be high in one and low in the other, and multiple needs may be affected by a single action.

Murray differentiated each need as unique, but recognized commonalities among them, codified at least partially in his categorization system. Behaviors may meet more than one need:  for instance, performing a difficult task for your fraternity may meet the needs of both achievement and affiliation. While each need is important in and of itself, he also believed that needs can support or conflict with one another, and can be interrelated. He coined the term 'subsidation of needs' to describe when two or more needs are combined in order to satisfy a more powerful need, and the term 'fusion of needs' to describe when a single action satisfies more than one need.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, the need for dominance may conflict the need with affiliation when overly controlling behavior drives away family, romantic partners, and friends. A need may be a purely internal state, but more often it is evoked by a press.

== Presses ==

Murray argued environmental factors play a role in how psychogenic needs are displayed in behavior. He used the term 'presses' to describe external influences on motivation that may influence an individual's level of a need as well as their subsequent behavior. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The 'press' of an object is what it can do for or to the subject.

Any stimulus with the potential to affect the individual in a positive or negative way is referred to as 'pressive,' and everything else is referred to as inert. 'Pressive Perception' is how the subject interprets a press as either a positive or negative stimulus. 'Pressive Apperception' refers to the subjects anticipation that the stimulus will be perceived as either positive or negative. Murray notes that both Pressive Perception and Apperception are largely unconscious. Presses may have positive or negative effects, may be mobile (affecting the subject if they do nothing) or immobile (affecting the subject if they take an action), and may be an alpha press (real effects) or a beta press (merely perceived).

== Needs by Category ==
Murray divides needs into several binary categories; Manifest (Overt) or Latent (Covert), Conscious or Unconscious, and Primary (viscerogenic) and Secondary (psychogenic) needs&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Manifest (sometimes called overt) needs are those that are allowed to be directly expressed, while latent (sometimes called covert) needs are not outwardly acted on&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Paul|last2=Culbertson|first2=Amy L.|last3=Magnusson|first3=Paul|title=Human Needs: A Literature Review and Cognitive Life Span Model|journal=Navy Personnel Research and Development Center|date=April 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Conscious needs as those that a subject can self-report, while Unconscious needs are all others. This is distinct from manifest vs latent in that a person may directly express a need they are unaware of, or not express a need they are aware of. The categorization most commonly referred to is the division between Primary (viscerogenic) and Secondary (psychogenic) needs.

=== Primary/Viscerogenic Needs ===
Primary (Viscerogenic) needs are defined by Murray&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as needs involving some biological process and arise in response to certain stimuli or events that drive the body towards a certain outcome ('positive' or 'negative').For example, dehydration would trigger a "need for water," which in turn drives a person to seek out and intake water. The first six primary needs; Air, Water, Food, Sentience, Sex, and Lactation, are considered 'positive' needs, as they drive a person towards a certain object or action. The remaining seven; Expiration, Urination, Defecation, and the four avoidance needs (see 'Retraction' below), are considered to be 'negative' needs as they drive a person away from an object (or in some cases towards the expulsion of an object).

=== Secondary/Psychogenic Needs ===
Secondary (Psychogenic) needs emerge from or are influenced by primary needs. Murray identified 17 secondary needs, each belonging to one of eight need domains: Ambition, Materialism, Status, Power, Sado-Masochism, Social-Conformance, Affection, and Information. Needs in each domain have similar themes underpinning them; for instance, the Ambition domain contains all those needs which relate to achievement and recognition.

==Applications==

===Personality testing===

Murray's system of needs has influenced the creation of personality testing, including both objective and subjective measures&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. A personality test is a questionnaire or other standardized instrument designed to reveal aspects of an individual's character or psychological makeup. Murray's system of needs directly influenced the development of a variety of personality measures, including the ''Personality Research Form'' and the ''Jackson Personality Inventory''&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Henry A|title=Thematic apperception test.|date=1943|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Thematic apperception test===

Henry Murray, along with [[Christiana Morgan]], developed the [[thematic apperception test]] (TAT) as a tool to assess personality. The TAT is based on the assumption that human unconscious needs are directed towards an external stimulus. Murray and Morgan created the TAT to evaluate "press" and "need," which Murray emphasized in his theory of personality. The TAT is administered  by an  assessor, who chooses a subset of cards (generally concerning a particular theme, or those that they feel best suit the subject) out of the 32 available; Murray recommended selecting 20&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cramer|first1=P|title=Storytelling, narrative, and the Thematic Apperception Test.|date=2004|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Each card features various ambiguous scenes which relate to interpersonal situations. The test-taker is asked to give a detailed explanation of what they see. For example, an explanation may include a narrative of what is happening and what may unfold, and what the characters in the scene are feeling or thinking. From this narrative, the assessor uses Murray's theoretical themes to infer personality characteristics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Further research===

Murray's theory of personality was the basis for several areas of further psychological research. Three of the needs he identified–the [[need for power]], the [[need for affiliation]], and the [[need for achievement]]–were later the subject of substantial study and considered especially significant; used to develop theories such as [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], [[David McClelland]]'s 'Achievement Motivation Theory', aspects of [[Richard Boyatzis]]' competency-based models of management effectiveness, and more.

Murray's concept of the 'press' and his emphasis on the importance of environmental events (and their subjective interpretation) were also highly significant to later psychological research. Behavioral psychology-pioneered by [[John B. Watson]] and [[B. F. Skinner]]-focused on environmental events, while cognitive psychology included a focus on subjective interpretation of events, based on another one of Murray's ideas (his categorization of presses as either Alpha or Beta).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Salem health: psychology &amp; mental health|last1=Piotrowski|first1=Nancy A|date=2010|publisher=Salem Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

Although Murray's theory has had a substantial influence on personality testing and research, some critics say that his system of needs is too broad and rather subjective. One criticism of this hierarchy is that it lacks the objective criterion for needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personality: Determinants, Dynamics, and Potentials|last=Cervone|first=Daniel|last2=Vittorio Caprara|first2=Gian|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=0521587484|location=|pages=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be said that some of the needs can conflict with each other like achievement and nurturance, which deal with opposing ideas of having to obstacles with achievement being active and nurturance being passive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When evaluating the TAT, critics have claimed that the test has a low test-retest reliability and validity. This could possibly be due to contrasting instructions from the experimenters.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''northern hardwood forest''' is a general type of [[North America]]n forest ecosystem found over much of southeastern and south central [[Canada]], Ontario and Quebec, extending south into the [[United States]] in northern [[New England]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Pennsylvania]], and west along the [[Great Lakes]] to [[Minnesota]] and western [[Ontario]]. Some ecologists consider it a [[transitional forest]] because it contains species common to both the [[oak-hickory forest]] community to the south and the [[Boreal forest]] community to the north. The trees and shrub species of the Northern Hardwood Forest are known for their brilliant fall colors, making the regions that contain this forest type popular [[fall foliage]] tourist destinations. 

[[Sugar maple]], [[yellow birch]], [[American beech]], and [[Fraxinus americana|White Ash]] are the common key indicator tree and shrub species in the Northern Hardwood Forest. Other species include [[Tsuga canadensis|eastern hemlock]] and [[eastern white pine]]. Herb and heath species include [[wintergreen]], [[wild sarsaparilla]], and [[wood sorrel]]. Birds and animals common to the Northern Hardwood Forest include the [[black-capped chickadee]], [[white-throated sparrow]], [[cedar waxwing]], [[porcupine]], [[snowshoe hare]], [[white-tailed deer]], and [[American Red Squirrel]]. 

Most of the Northern Hardwood Forest is not [[virgin forest]], it is regrowth following centuries of commercial timber harvesting and the clearing of land for agricultural purposes. This is particularly true of New England, New York, and Eastern Canada, where the land was cleared to make room for farms in the 17th and 18th centuries and subsequently abandoned in the 19th century when farming interests migrated to the midwestern United States and central Canada. 

The Northern Hardwood Forest is indigenous to several well-known parks and national forests, including the [[Boundary Waters]] region of Minnesota, New York's [[Adirondack Park]], the [[White Mountain National Forest]] in New Hampshire, the [[Green Mountain National Forest]] in Vermont, [[Baxter State Park]] and [[Acadia National Park]] in Maine, and [[Fundy National Park]] in [[New Brunswick]]. The [[Berkshires]] region of western [[Massachusetts]] is very typical of a Northern Hardwood Forest ecosystem.  Northern hardwood stands are also found in the higher elevations of the southern [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], typically between {{convert|4500|ft|m}} and {{convert|5500|ft|m}}, where climatic conditions resemble those in northern states and southern Canada.

While the term is associated with [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], Warburg restricts the concept to cultural-psychological themes, as he held "an honest disgust of aestheticizing art history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forster|first1=Kurt|last2=Britt|first2=David|title=Aby Warbug: His Study of Ritual and Art on Two Continents|journal=The MIT Press|date=1996|volume=77|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its name, pathosformel does not provide a calculable formula to identify visual links among images. Instead, it calls on collective and individual imagination to find such links apart from those based on age, type, size, or origin. In historian Kurt Forster's words, "it exerts its control over existing figurations in a way that endows them with new, 'sign-giving' qualities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forster|first1=Kurt|last2=Britt|first2=David|title=Aby Warbug: His Study of Ritual and Art on Two Continents|journal=The MIT Press|date=1996|volume=77|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]], described pathosformel as "the primeval reaction of man to the universal hardships of his existence [that] underlies all his attempts at mental orientation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gombrich|first1=Ernst Hans|title=Aby Warburg: An Intellectual Biography|date=1986|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=0714824275|page=223|url=https://books.google.fr/books/about/Aby_Warburg.html?id=agfqAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sandro_Botticelli_-_La_nascita_di_Venere_-_Google_Art_Project_-_edited.jpg|thumb|Botticelli's ''The Birth of Venus'' c. 1486.]]
Warburg's early work on paintings by [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]] as well as his later work on the reappearance of astrological symbols in artwork and popular ephemera employ the concept of pathosformel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forster|first1=Kurt|last2=Britt|first2=David|title=Aby Warbug: His Study of Ritual and Art on Two Continents|journal=The MIT Press|date=1996|volume=77|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His dissertation, completed in 1893 presents an early formulation of the concept in comparing Botticelli's [[The Birth of Venus|Birth of Venus]] with [[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]] by looking at the ''bewegtes Beiwerk'' or "animated incident" that appears among them. To Warburg, this incident is the depiction of wind that animates the paintings. In the former, it is seen in Venus's flowing hair, while in the latter, it is seen in the flowing dress of the nymph Flora on the far right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rampley|first1=Mathew|title=From Symbol to Allegory: Aby Warburg's Theory of Art|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=1997|volume=79|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forster|first1=Kurt|last2=Britt|first2=David|title=Aby Warbug: His Study of Ritual and Art on Two Continents|journal=The MIT Press|date=1996|volume=77|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Botticelli-primavera.jpg|thumb|left|Botticelli's ''Primavera'' c. 1482.]]

In 1905, Warburg presented a lecture on Dürer and Italian Antiquity, in which he used pathosformel to approach images by [[Dürer]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], Antonio Pollaiuolo and others from the point of view of a historical psychology of human expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forster|first1=Kurt|last2=Britt|first2=David|last3=Warburg|first3=Aby|title=The Renewal of Pagan Antiquity: Contributions to the Cultural History of the European Renaissance|date=1999|publisher=Getty Research Institute for the History of Art and the Humanities|isbn=978-0892365371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warburg's unfinished montage, the Mnemosyne Atlas provides another example of the pathosformel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rampley|first1=Mathew|title=From Symbol to Allegory: Aby Warburg's Theory of Art|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=1997|volume=79|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forster|first1=Kurt|last2=Britt|first2=David|title=Aby Warbug: His Study of Ritual and Art on Two Continents|journal=The MIT Press|date=1996|volume=77|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, Warburg pairs a [[Dürer]] engraving from [[Apocalypse (Dürer)|Apocalypse with Pictures]] (1498) with an image featured in a popular tarot illustrated by the same artist  (1494/5). While the image of the chariot links these works compositionally, the chariot itself signifies for Warburg the need to control a potentially disastrous conflict, thus linking similar psychological dynamics in different works regardless of their high or low cultural origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Becker|first1=Colleen|title=Aby Warburg's Pathosformel as methodological paradigm|journal=Journal of Art Historiography|date=2013|page=11|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warburg acknowledged, however, that the  persistence of a motif does not necessarily carry with it the same meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Posècq|first1=Avigdor|title=Left and Right Orientation of a Pathosformel in Dürer|journal=Notes in the History of Art|date=1996|volume=16|issue=1|pages=7–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pathosformel is closely related to, albeit distinct from  [[Robert Vischer]]'s notion of [[empathy]] (Einfühlung), which Warburg refers to as the "force active in the generation of style".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rampley|first1=Mathew|title=From Symbol to Allegory: Aby Warburg's Theory of Art|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=1997|volume=79|issue=1|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''prestressed structure''' is one whose overall [[integrity]], [[Structural stability|stability]] and [[security]] depend, primarily, on ''prestressing'': the intentional creation of permanent stresses in the structure for the purpose of improving its performance under various service conditions.&lt;ref name=PrestressedConcreteDesign&gt;{{cite book|title= Design of Prestressed Concrete|author=Nilson, Arthur H.|year=1987|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-471-83072-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic types of prestressing are:
*Precompression with mostly the structure's own weight
*[[Prestressed concrete|Pre-tensioning]] with high-strength embedded tendons
*[[Prestressed concrete|Post-tensioning]] with high-strength bonded or unbonded tendons
Today, the concept of a prestressed structure is widely employed in the design of [[building]]s, underground structures, TV towers, power stations, floating storage and offshore facilities, [[nuclear reactor]] vessels, and numerous [[bridge]] systems.&lt;ref name=PrestressedConcrete&gt;{{cite book|title= Prestressed Concrete|author=Nawy, Edward G.|year=1989|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-698375-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The idea of precompression was apparently familiar to ancient Roman architects. The tall attic wall of the [[Colosseum]] works as a stabilizing device for the wall piers beneath it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12125">The assessment of '''risk factors for [[genocide]]''' is an upstream prevention mechanism for genocide. This means that, if used correctly, the international community would be able to foresee a genocide before the killing took place, and prevent it. Countries can have many warning signs that it may be leaning in the direction of a future genocide. If signs are presented the international community takes notes of them and watches over the countries that have a higher risk. Many different scholars, and international groups, have come up with different factors that they think should be considered while examining whether a nation is at risk or not.  One predominant scholar in the field [[James Waller]] came up with his own four categories of risk factors; including, governance, conflict history, economic conditions, and social fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;Waller, James, Dr. "Upstream Prevention: Risk Assessment and Prediction." HGS 374 Comparative Genocide. [[Keene State College]], Keene. 03 Mar. 2015. Lecture.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dr. [[James Waller]]'s risk factors ==

=== Governance ===

The regime type of the government is an indicator on whether the nation is in danger of genocide or not. An anocratic, or a transitional government, is the government that is in the most danger while a full monarchy, in the most stable.  The nation also has a higher risk if there is state legitimacy deficit, which would include high corruption, disregard for constitutional norms, or mass protests. If a state structure is weak and provides poor basic services for the citizens, restricted the rule of law, or has a lack of civilian protection, it also creates a higher risk and could become unstable. If there is identity-based polar factionalism or systematic state-led discrimination through exclusionary ideology, or political contentious along identity line this can create a divide of people in the nation creating different ranks and violence amongst the civilians.

=== Conflict History ===

A state is more likely to experience genocide or mass atrocity if they have a history of identity-related tensions, otherwise known as a tendency of othering, or if the state had prior genocides/[[politicide]]s, this is because a government may already have the previous weapons, strategies, and power since the last genocide. They are also aware of how much damage they can do once more if they have gotten away in the past. Also if the state has had a record of serious violations of international human rights laws, as the country is more sensitized to the violence and may be less aware of what is happening around them.  Other conflict histories that put a state at risk are past cultural traumas that have hurt the core social identity of the state, or if the people have been known to have a legacy of group grievances or vengeance. The more conflict a country has had in the past can make them more unstable and more at risk for genocide.

=== Economic Conditions ===

States with low levels of economy development are more likely to have problems because it creates low opportunity cost for mass violence, as the citizen’s lives aren't valued as much as in an economy that has high levels. States that practice economic discrimination, make it so one group of people have the most economic opportunity, forcing the other group to be unemployed and or if they have horizontal economic inequalities, which is when a country’s economy is based on a small number of opportunities, products.  Those conditions with the addition of high unemployment rates, foreign debt, and informal economies such as growing [[black market]]s a country is at risk of its economic conditions playing into their risk factors for Genocide.

=== Social Fragmentation ===

Social fragmentation can by five major subcategories; identity-based social divisions, demographic pressures, unequal access to basic goods and services, gender inequalities, and political instability.  Identity-based social divisions, constitute of differential access to power, wealth, statues, and resources, meaning that certain people have more access to what the need to live than others, or when a state practices hate speech, like [[Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines|RTLMC]] in Rwanda.  Demographic pressures can be experienced in a state has a high population density, massive movements of refugees or internal displaced peoples, or a male youth bulge, which means that there is a high male population with nothing really to do. Unequal access to basic goods and services, which can be shown by high infant mortality rates, as mothers and children would not be getting the proper care that they needed to grow and be healthy.  Gender inequalities are shown in rate of violence against women, as these are normally an indicator of how the country views their women, and if it is a low rate they normally see them more as equals.  Political instability can be revealed by hurtful regime changes, threats of armed conflict, proportions of populations that are armed, and where the country is in the world, and if its neighboring countries have conflict it has been known to spill into the neighboring regions.

If a nation has one or more of these risk factors it does not mean that they will have a genocide but they are simply additive factors that when put together can be used to help predict and defuse a tense, or dangerous, situation. There is no guarantee or formula that allows you to predict the future but instead thing to help us learn from the past to help protect the future.

== UN risk assessment “Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes" ==
The [[United Nations]] have their list of 14 risk factors for atrocity crimes with multiple indicators for each factor. These risk factors include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/methodology.shtml | title=Office of The Special Adviser on The Prevention of Genocide | publisher=UN | work=UN News Center | accessdate=July 8, 2017| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209184252/http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/methodology.shtml | archivedate= February 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common risk factors:
# Situation of armed conflict or other forms of instability
# Record of serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law
# Weakness of State structures
# Motives or incentives
# Capacity to commit atrocity crimes
# Absence of mitigating factors
# Enabling circumstances or preparatory action
# Triggering factors
Risk factors specific to each international crime:

For genocide:
# Intergroup tensions or patterns of discrimination against protected groups
# Signs of an intent to destroy in whole or in part a protected group

For crimes against humanity:
# Signs of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population
# Signs of a plan or policy to attack any civilian population

For war crimes:
# Serious threats to those protected under IHL
# Serious threats to humanitarian or peacekeeping operations

The UN is different in that it separates specific factors that lead to different crimes. Such that “serious threats to humanitarian or peacekeeping operators” will lead to war crimes while “Intergroup tensions or patterns of discrimination against protected groups” (under Article 2 of the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]]) is a risk factor to genocide. These guidelines were expanded upon and published in 2014 as the booklet ''Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes: A tool for prevention''.&lt;ref name="UN Framework of Analysis"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/publications-and-resources/Framework%20of%20Analysis%20for%20Atrocity%20Crimes_EN.pdf | title=Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes: A tool for prevention | publisher=United Nations | author=United Nations Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect | year=2014 | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fund for Peace’s Analysis: “Conflict Assessment System Tool (CAST)”  ==
[[The Fund for Peace]] non-profit organization, has written a conflict assessment framework manual to help “meet security challenges stemming from weak and failing states.” CAST has 12 pressure indicators including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://library.fundforpeace.org/cfsir1418 | title=CAST Conflict Assessment Framework Manual (CFSIR1418, 2014 Reprint) | publisher=[[The Fund for Peace]] | year=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Demographic pressures
# Refugees and internally displaced people
# Group grievance
# Human flight and brain drain
# Uneven economic development 
# Economic decline
# State Legitimacy  
# Public Services 
# Human rights and rule of law
# Security Apparatus 
# Factionalized Elites 
# External intervention

Along with each pressure indicator is a list of scores indicating when that indicator is becoming a serious risk factor. A score of 0 means there is no risk at all score of 10 would be a serious problem. Also included in the CAST is a guide to assessing the capacities of the state. The capacities are leadership, military, police, judiciary and civil service.

== European Commission: checklist for root causes of conflict ==
The [[European Commission]] has come up with their own risk factors to countries with possible atrocities coming in the near future. The eight risk factors they chose are:&lt;ref&gt;Ahlfors, K., and M. Van Bellingen Relex. [http://www.eplo.org/assets/files/3.%20Resources/EU%20Documents/European%20Commission_Programming%20Fiche_Conflict_Prevention.pdf "Programming Guide for Strategy Papers."] [[European Peacebuilding Liaison Office]]. European Commission, Nov. 2008. Web. 20 Apr. 2015. &lt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Legitimacy Deficit 
# Restrictions to the rule of law
# Violations on fundamental rights
# Weak civil society and media
# Tensions between communities/ Absence of dispute-resolution mechanisms 
# Poor economic management 
# Socio-economic regional inequalities 
# Geopolitical instability

Each risk factor has other multiple subsections that can point to more specific events that can be seen as potential risk factors for conflict. Along with the subsections, there are examples of what possible objectives could be in order to improve that specific risk factor.

== Dr. Gregory Stanton: "Ten Stages of Genocide"==
The International Alliance to End Genocide published [[Gregory Stanton]]’s list of ten stages of genocide, which include, in this order:&lt;ref name="Stanton-Ten Stages"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.genocidewatch.org/genocide/tenstagesofgenocide.html | title=The Ten Stages of Genocide | publisher=The International Alliance to End Genocide|work=Genocide Watch | accessdate=July 8, 2017 | author=Stanton, Gregory H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Classification
# Symbolization
# Discrimination
# Dehumanization
# Organization
# Polarization
# Preparation
# Persecution
# Extermination
# Denial
These stages are can be seen with every genocide so far and can be used as red flags for future ones. Each stage has an explanation of what it is and examples of it. This list of risk factors has been used by the US State Department.

== Dr. Barbara Harff ==
[[Barbara Harff]] came up with a list of seven risk factors for genocide and politicide:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gpanet.org/content/risks-new-onsets-genocide-and-politicide-2013 | title=Risks of New Onsets of Genocide and Politicide in 2013 | publisher=s | date=December 3, 2013| accessdate=July 8, 2017 | author=Harff, Dr. Barbara, and [[Ted Robert Gurr]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Recent changes in Geno/pol Hazards
# Current Instability
# Contention re Elite Ethnicity 
# Regime Type 
# Targets of Systematic Discrimination 
# Exclusionary Ideology 
# Past Geno/Politicides

Barbara Harff uses these risk factors and gives each potential country at risk a hazard ratio score along with each onset of genocide. This is a more complicated way of assessing the risks of other countries, but having a number is more relatable to assessing risk.

'''Scott Sunken Garden''' is a historical landmark in [[Lansing, Michigan]], United States of America.

The outer foundation walls are 51 feet by 79 feet and the center is a 28 feet by 45 feet lawn. There are shorter [[limestone]] walls lining the court with raised flower beds. The west side and east sides have limestone steps leading to a small water pond below the grotto center piece. This foundation of Justice Edward Cahill's home was redesigned after 1930 by a new American immigrant, Nick Kriek. The gardening includes bulbs, annuals, perennials and a list of species introduced to the area by Kriek himself.
The garden has been maintained by the Greater Lansing Garden Club for 3 decades; they restored it after a few decades of neglect by the city.&lt;ref name="The New Citizens Press Sunday: September 26, 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tncp.net/Articles/tabid/1800/articletype/ArticleView/articleID/2475/Default.aspx |title=History of Scott Sunken Garden and Its Restoration &gt; The New Citizens Press &amp;#124; TNCP &amp;#124; Lansing Michigan News &gt; TNCP &amp;#124; Greater Lansing MI News |publisher=tncp.net|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scott Sunken Garden landmark has a list of historically significant ties including 1930's "Golden Age of American Landscaping", Immigration, Civil Rights, and Lansing's Beautification.&lt;ref name="Non-profit Community Advocacy Organized for Scott Sunken Gardens"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/scottsunkengarden |title=Scott Sunken Garden, Friends |publisher=facebook.com|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==

National Register Coordinator for the State of Michigan state that the Scott Sunken Garden Is eligible for listing in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].... The garden appears to meet national register criteria B and C...." &lt;ref name="Robert O. Christensen, National Register Coordinator, State Historic Preservation Office, MI State Housing Development Authority"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/scott-sunken-garden-friends/national-register-coordinators-recommendation-of-scott-sunken-gardens-historical/1027945290586784 |title=National Register Coordinator’s recommendation of Scott Sunken Garden’s historical recognition as a national asset |publisher=facebook.com|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
"Even though the Scott House  itself – the house  that stood just west of the garden near the Jenison House/Scott Center –  that formed the central feature of the property no longer exists, the  garden stands out as a fine example of formal landscape garden design  from the early twentieth century (various dates  of construction from the mid-1920s to 1934-35 have been reported). As  far as I’ve been able to determine from all the recent discussions, the  garden is unique in Lansing as a formal garden that, designed for an  urban residential setting, dates from the early  twentieth century period when landscaped gardens and estates associated  with them reached a height of design perfection, during what has been  called the “Golden Age of American Landscape Design.” The Scott Sunken  Garden, in my mind, possesses additional significance  as a prime achievement of a local Lansing artisan, Nick or Nicolaas  Isaac Willem Kriek. Kriek (1895–1978) was born in the Netherlands and, settling in Lansing in the early 1920s, founded the Cottage Gardens  nursery in 1923. Bill Hicks, Mr. Kriek’s grandson  and today part of the still operating family-owned business, states  that Nick Kriek built the Sunken Garden for Scott, from whom he had  purchased the property on which the Cottage Gardens nursery was  established in 1923. It seems logical to think that Kriek  had a major hand in designing the garden to meet the Scotts’ wishes and  requirements. The garden also possesses importance for its direct  association with an important Lansing citizen, Richard H. Scott, who  owned the property and had the garden created. Marilyn  Lee’s 2010 history of the garden states that Scott came to Lansing in  1898 to work for auto pioneer R. E. Olds and helped organize Olds’ Reo  Motor Car Company and served as president of the company after Olds  retired in 1923."
&lt;ref name="Robert O. Christensen, National Register Coordinator, State Historic Preservation Office, MI State Housing Development Authority" /&gt;
This Scott Sunken Garden foundation is presumed to be the remains of Justice Edward Cahill's Lansing home. He moved to Lansing after serving in the Civil War and went to war serving beside African American soldiers in Michigan's 102nd USCI on a campaign through southern states. Justice Edward Cahill served in the Michigan Supreme Court in 1890.&lt;ref name="Men of Progress, Embracing Biographical Sketches of Representative Michigan Men With an Outline History of the State, Dedicated to the Newspaper Press of Michigan Detroit, Michigan Published by the Evening News Association 1900"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/137660544586/permalink/10154507434494587/ |title=Historical Society of Greater Lansing public group &amp;#124; Facebook &amp;#124; "Men of Progress" |publisher=facebook.com|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Cahill also concurred upholding [[Racial equality]] in USA's landmark Civil Right's "William W.

The local chapter of this national garden club has a long history with both the Scott Sunken Garden and the Scott Center. The club met at the Scott Center before it was moved to Scott Park and the Garden Club invested the financing to restoration of this landmark garden through the early 80s. The city actually fell short of original expectations and the Garden Club even paid for a restoration of the lower wall of the Scott Sunken Garden &lt;ref name="The New Citizens Press Sunday: September 26, 2010" /&gt;

The city is in need of widespread upgrades to the Power Grid infrastructure inducing several substations to replace the older Eckert Substation next to the Eckert Power Station. The [[Lansing Board of Water and Light]] (LBWL) and Mayor Virg Bernero have pushed for a large Central Substation with their proposal to destroy a riverside park (Scott Park) and to remove historical integrity of its historical landmark of Scott Sunken Garden.

===LBWL Proposals===

The LBWL had submitted an original proposal to the Lansing Parks and Recreation then amended it during the review by the Lansing Planning Board. These Board's are appointed by the Mayor and their decisions are being reviewed by the Lansing City Council.

===Parkland Advocacy===

The Scott Sunken Garden caretakers of 3 decades, the Greater Lansing Garden Club, has declined the LBWL offer of the new garden wanting the historical garden to remain in tact. Each public board meeting and the public meeting held by Jessica Yorko (as Lansing City Council, 4th Ward Representative) were occupied with citizen advocates. There are multiple community organizations publicly advocating saving Scott Sunken Garden, and its Scott Park; "Preservation Lansing" has advocated this along with a list of other historical concerns in the area; [http://www.facebook.com/scottsunkengarden "Friends of Scott Sunken Garden Park"] is a non-profit advocacy organization instituted for protecting Scott Sunken Garden and its neighboring assets of the People of Lansing.

====Public Petitions====

'''Short prose''' is a generic term for various kinds of very short [[fictional]] [[prose]]; short prose may or may not be [[narrative]]. Short prose pieces are considerably shorter than a [[short story]], i.e., usually less than c. 1,000 words. Because of their small size, short prose pieces can attain high levels of lexical density and may thereby resemble [[prose poetry|prose poems]], but the focus in short prose is less on language itself (and thus on [[rhythm]], metre, or other phonological effects) than on the rapid presentation of a situation.

A piece of short prose may contain [[drama]], but it normally differs from a [[vignette (literature)|vignette]] in that it has no necessary associations with theatre or character. Because [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] is peripheral to, or nonexistent in, short prose, a short prose piece differs from a [[sketch story]] in that it does not necessarily invite the reader to imagine what came before or what follows after. Finally, because a piece of short prose does not necessarily have characters, conflict, or resolution, it usually differs from the [[short short story]], [[flash fiction]] and [[microfiction]] as these are usually defined.

Writers who have favoured the use of short prose include [[Fyodor Sologub]], [[Daniil Kharms]] (Случаи), [[Dezső Kosztolányi]], [[István Örkény]] (''Egyperces novellák''), Samuel Beckett ([[Fizzles]]), [[Francis Ponge]] (''[[Le parti pris des choses]]''), [[David Eggers]] (''[[Short Short Stories]]''),  [[Eduardo Berti]] (''[[La Vie Impossible]]'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12719">'''Socioemotional selectivity theory''' ('''SST'''; developed by Stanford psychologist [[Laura L. Carstensen]]) is a life-span theory of motivation. The theory maintains that as time horizons shrink, as they typically do with age, people become increasingly selective, investing greater resources in emotionally meaningful goals and activities. According to the theory, motivational shifts also influence cognitive processing. Aging is associated with a relative preference for positive over negative information in attention and memory (called the "[[positivity effect]]").

==Overview==
Because they place a high value on emotional satisfaction, older adults often spend more time with familiar individuals with whom they have had rewarding relationships.&lt;ref name="Santrock"&gt;Santrock, J.W. (2008). ''A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development''. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.{{page needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This selective narrowing of social interaction maximizes positive emotional experiences and minimizes emotional risks as individuals become older. According to this theory, older adults systematically hone their social networks so that available  social partners satisfy their emotional needs.&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt;

The theory also focuses on the types of goals that individuals are motivated to achieve. Knowledge-related goals aim at knowledge acquisition, career planning, the development of new social relationships and other endeavors that will pay off in the future. Emotion-related goals are aimed at emotion regulation, the pursuit of emotionally gratifying interactions with  social partners and other pursuits whose benefits can be realized in the present.

When people perceive their future as open ended, they tend to focus on future-oriented and development- or knowledge-related goals, but when they feel that time is running out and the opportunity to reap rewards from future-oriented goals' realization is dwindling, their focus tends to shift towards present-oriented and emotion- or pleasure-related goals.&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt;  Research on this theory often compares age groups (''e.g.'', young adulthood vs. old adulthood), but the shift in goal priorities is a gradual process that begins in early adulthood.  Importantly, the theory contends that the cause of these goal shifts is not age itself, ''i.e.'', not the passage of time itself, but rather an age-associated shift in time perspective.&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt;

This justified shift in perspective is the rational equivalent of the psychological perceptual disorder known as "foreshortened future," in which an individual, usually a young and physically healthy individual, unreasonably believes (either consciously or unconsciously) that his/her time horizons are more limited than they actually are, with the effect that the individual undervalues long-term goals and long-run pleasure and instead disproportionately pursues short-term goals and pleasure, thereby [[Opportunity cost|diverting resources from investment for the future]] and often even actively reducing his/her long-term prospects.

==Cross-cultural incidence==
Researchers have found that across diverse samples – ranging from [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]]s to [[Catholic nun]]s to [[African-American]]s to [[Chinese American]]s{{clarify|date=February 2013}} to [[European-American]]s – older adults report better control of their emotions and fewer negative emotions than do younger adults.&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt; At the same time, culture seems to color how aging-related effects impact one's emotional life: Whereas older Americans were shown to de-emphasize negative experiences more than younger Americans, no such effect has been observed in Japan. Instead, older Japanese were shown to assign a greater value to positive aspects of otherwise negative experiences than younger Japanese, whereas no such effect has been observed in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0036041|pmid=24749641|title=A cultural perspective on emotional experiences across the life span|journal=Emotion|volume=14|issue=4|pages=679|year=2014|last1=Grossmann|first1=Igor|last2=Karasawa|first2=Mayumi|last3=Kan|first3=Chiemi|last4=Kitayama|first4=Shinobu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positivity effect in older adults==

=== In perception ===
Studies have found that older adults are more likely than younger adults to pay attention to positive than negative stimuli (as assessed by the [[dot-probe paradigm]] and eye-tracking methods). However, the effect also differs across cultures. For example, Hong Kong Chinese looked away from happy stimuli and more towards fearful stimuli,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fung | first1 = H. H. | last2 = Lu | first2 = A. Y. | last3 = Goren | first3 = D. | last4 = Isaacowitz | first4 = D. M. | last5 = Wadlinger | first5 =  | last6 = Wilson | first6 = H.

H. | last2 = Isaacowitz | first2 = D. M. | last3 = Lu | first3 = A. Y. | last4 = Li | first4 = T. | year = 2010 | title = Interdependent self-construal moderates the age-related negativity reduction effect in memory and visual attention | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 321–9 | doi = 10.1037/a0019079 | pmid = 20545417 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In recall ===
The term ''positivity effect'' also refers to age differences in emotional attention and memory. As people get older, they experience fewer negative emotions and they tend to look to the past in a positive light.{{sfn|Mather|Carstensen|2005}} In addition, compared with younger adults' memories, older adults' memories are more likely to consist of positive than negative information and more likely to be distorted in a positive direction. This version of the positivity effect was coined by Laura L. Carstensen's research team.&lt;ref name="Carstensen2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carstensen|first1=L. L.|title=The Influence of a Sense of Time on Human Development|journal=Science|date=2006|volume=312|issue=5782|pages=1913–1915|doi=10.1126/science.1127488|pmid=16809530|pmc=2790864|bibcode=2006Sci...312.1913C}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a debate about the cross-cultural generalizability of the aging-related positivity effect, with some evidence for different types of emotional processing among Americans as compared to Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A cultural perspective on emotional experiences across the life span|journal=Emotion|date=2014|doi=10.1037/a0036041 |pmid=24749641 |volume=14 |issue=4|pages=679–92|last1=Grossmann|first1=I|last2=Karasawa|first2=M|last3=Kan|first3=C|last4=Kitayama|first4=S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hypothesized causes====
One theory of the positivity effect in older adults' memories is that it is produced by cognitive control mechanisms that improve and decrease negative information due to older adults' greater focus on emotional regulation.{{sfn|Mather|Carstensen|2005}} Research shows an age-related reversal in the valence of information processed within the [[medial prefrontal cortex]] (MPFC). In younger adults, more MPFC activity was found in the presence of negative stimuli compared to positive stimuli whereas in older adults this was reversed.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

However, the positivity effect may be different for stimuli processed automatically (pictures) and stimuli processed in a more controlled manner (words). Compared to words, pictures tend to be processed more rapidly and they engage emotion processing centres earlier. Automatic stimuli are processed in the [[amygdala]] and dorsal MPFC, whereas controlled stimuli are processed in the temporal pole and ventral MPFC. Compared to younger adults, older adults showed less amygdala activation and more MPFC activation for negative than positive pictures. Increased motivation to regulate emotion leads older adults to actively engage the mPFC differently from younger adults, which in turn yields diverging amygdala activation patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid =  18455837| pmc =  3541693| year =  2010| last1 =  St. Jacques| first1 =  P| title =  Effects of aging on functional connectivity of the amygdala during negative evaluation: A network analysis of fMRI data| journal =  Neurobiology of Aging| volume =  31| issue =  2| pages =  315–327| last2 =  Dolcos| first2 =  F| last3 =  Cabeza| first3 =  R| doi =  10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2008.03.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite pattern was observed for words. Although older adults showed a positivity effect in memory for words, they did not display one for pictures. Thus, the positivity effect may arise from ageing differences in MPFC use during encoding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leclerc | first1 = C. | last2 = Kensinger | first2 = E. | year = 2011 | title = Neural processing of emotional pictures and words: A comparison of young and older adults | url = | journal = Developmental Neuropsychology | volume = 36 | issue = 4| pages = 519–538 | doi = 10.1080/87565641.2010.549864 | pmid = 21516546 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tatoeba.org''' is a free [[collaboration|collaborative]] online [[database]] of example sentences geared towards [[Second-language acquisition|foreign language learners]].  Its name comes from the Japanese term "tatoeba" (例えば　''tatoeba''), meaning "for example".  Unlike other [[Dictionary#Online dictionaries|online dictionaries]], which focus on words, '''Tatoeba''' focuses on translation of [[complete sentence]]s.  In addition, the structure of the database and interface emphasize [[one-to-many (data model)|one-to-many relationships]]. Not only can a sentence have multiple translations within a single language, but its translations into all languages are readily visible, as are indirect translations that involve a chain of stepwise links from one language to another.

==The aim of the project==
The aim of the Tatoeba Project is to create a database of sentences and translations that can be used by anyone developing a language learning [[application software|application]]. The idea is that the project creates the data, so [[programmer]]s can just focus on [[Computer programming|coding]] the application.

The data collected by the project is freely available under a [[Creative_Commons_license#Types_of_licenses|Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY)]] license.

==Content==
As of November 2017, the Tatoeba Corpus has over 6,000,000 sentences in 319 languages. The top 21 languages make up 90% of the corpus. Eighty-five of these languages have over 1,000 sentences. The top 13 languages have over 100,000 sentences each. The [[User interface|interface]] is available in 25 different languages. 

Tatoeba.org is also the current home of the Tanaka Corpus, a public-domain series of about 150,000 English-Japanese sentence pairs compiled by Hyogo University professor Yasuhito Tanaka first released in 2001, and where it is undergoing its latest revisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/Tanaka_Corpus |title=Tanaka Corpus |date=3 February 2011 |work=EDRDG Wiki |publisher=Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/wwwjdicinf.html#examp_tags |title=WWWJDIC – Information |date=2 March 2011 |last=Breen |first=Jim |work=WWWJDIC |publisher=Monash University |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual statistic of all languages are found at [https://tatoeba.org/epo/stats/sentences_by_language]

==History==

Tatoeba was founded by Trang Ho in 2006. She originally hosted the project on Sourceforge under the project name "multilangdict".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/multilangdict/|title=Trang's dictionary project|work=sourceforge.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interface==
Users, even those who are not registered, can search for words in any language to retrieve sentences that use them.  Each sentence in the Tatoeba database is displayed next to its translations in other languages; direct and indirect translations are differentiated.  Sentences are [[Tag (metadata)|tagged]] for content such as subject matter, [[dialect]], or [[vulgarity]]; they also each have individual comment threads to facilitate feedback and corrections from other users and cultural notes. As of early 2016, more than 200,000 sentences in 19 languages had audio readings. Sentences can also be browsed by language, tag, or audio.

Registered users can add new sentences or translate or proofread existing ones, even if their target language is not their native tongue. However, it is preferred that users translate into their native or "strongest" language and add sentences from their native language rather than translating into or adding from their target language.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wiki.tatoeba.org/articles/show/quick-start&lt;/ref&gt;  Translations are linked to the original sentence automatically.  Users can freely edit their own sentences, "adopt" and correct sentences without an owner, and comment on others' sentences.  Advanced contributors, a rank above ordinary contributors, can tag, link, and unlink sentences. Corpus maintainers, a rank above advanced contributors, can untag and delete sentences. They can also modify owned sentences, though they typically do so only if the owner fails to respond to a request to make the change.

==Database structure==
[[File:Grafeo.JPG|thumb|300px|right|A simplified [[diagram]] of Tatoeba's underlying data structure.]]
Tatoeba's basic [[data structure]] is a series of [[Node (computer science)|nodes]] and links.  Each sentence is a node; each link bridges two sentences with the same meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.tatoeba.org/2010/02/how-to-be-good-contributor-in-tatoeba.html |title=How to be a good contributor in Tatoeba |work=Tatoeba Project Blog |last=Ho |first=Trang |date=23 February 2010 |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==License==
The entire Tatoeba database is published under a [[Creative Commons licenses#Original licenses|Creative Commons Attribution 2.0]] license,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tatoeba.org/eng/terms-of-use |title=Terms of use |work=Tatoeba.org |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; freeing it for academic and other use.

==Grants==

Tatoeba received a grant from [[HASTAC#Events|Mozilla Drumbeat]] in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.tatoeba.org/2011/01/grant-from-mozilla-drumbeat.html |title=Grant from Mozilla Drumbeat |work=Tatoeba Project Blog |last=Ho |first=Trang |date=17 January 2011 |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yoyodyne.cc/tatoeba/ |title=Best Drumbeat Projects: Tatoeba – a free and open database of sentences |work=Yoyodyne.cc |last=Moltke |first=Henrik |date=30 December 2010 |quote=...the Mozilla Foundation wants to encourage and help the Tatoeba project by giving it a USD 2.5K Mozilla Drumbeat Grant. |accessdate=20 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102095352/http://yoyodyne.cc/tatoeba/ |archivedate=2 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some work on the Tatoeba infrastructure was sponsored by [[Google Summer of Code]], 2014 edition.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2014/tatoeba&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4508">Conservationists, ecologists, biodiversity scientists, lawmakers, and many others rely heavily on [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] information to manage, conserve, use, and share our biodiversity. The world-wide shortage of this important taxonomic information, the gaps in our taxonomic knowledge, and the shortage of trained taxonomists and curators to fill this need has come to be known as the '''taxonomic impediment'''. The importance of the taxonomic impediment was recognized by the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], signed at the 1992 Rio [[Earth Summit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/gti/|title=Convention on Biological Diversity: the Global Taxonomic Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt; and initiatives have occurred that have not yet solved the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wheeler, Q.D. |date=2008 |title= The New Taxonomy |chapter=Taxonomic shock and awe |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton  |editor= Q.D. Wheeler |pages= 211–226|volume=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The greatest contributions of taxonomy to science and humanity are yet to come. Against formidable odds and with minimal funding, equipment, infrastructure, organization and encouragement, taxonomists have discovered, described, and classified nearly 1.8 million species. While increasing attention is being paid to making this substantial amount of accumulated taxonomic information more easily accessible, comparatively little attention has been paid to opening access to the research resources required by taxonomists themselves. Benefits associated with ease of access to museum records (e.g. [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]]) or 'known' species (e.g. [[Encyclopedia of Life]]) are seriously restricted when such information is untested for validity or is simply unavailable, as is the case for three-quarters or more of the species on Earth. We act as if taxonomy is done but nothing could be farther from the truth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Transport geography''', also ''transportation geography'', is a branch of [[geography]] that investigates the movement and connections between people, goods and information on the [[Earth's surface]].

==Aims and scope==
Transportation geography detects, describes, and explains the Earth's surface's transportation spaces regarding location, substance, form, function, and genesis. It also investigates the effects of transportation on land use, on the physical material patterns at the surface of the earth known as 'cover patterns', and on other spatial processes such as environmental alterations. Moreover, it contributes to [[Transport planning|transport]], urban, and regional [[planning]].

[[Transportation]] is fundamental to the economic activity of exchange. Therefore, transport geography and [[economic geography]] are largely interrelated. At the most basic level, humans move and thus interact with each other by walking, but transportation geography typically studies more complex regional or global systems of transportation that include multiple interconnected modes like [[public transit]], personal [[cars]], [[bicycles]], freight [[railroads]], [[the Internet]], [[airplanes]] and more. Such systems are increasingly urban in character. Thus, transport and [[urban geography]] are closely intertwined. [[Cities]] are very much shaped, indeed created, by the types of exchange and interaction facilitated by movement.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, F. 1949 / 1995 The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Phillip II. Berkeley: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly since the 19th century, transportation is seen as a way cities, countries or firms compete with each other in a variety of spaces and contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, S., Marvin, S. 2001. Splintering Urbanism: Networked Infrastructures, Technological Mobilities and the Urban Condition: Networked Infrastructures, Technological Mobilites and the Urban Condition. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation modes==
{{Transportation geography graphical timeline}}
In terms of transport modes, the primary forms are [[Air transport|air]], [[Road transport|road]], [[Water transport|water]], and [[Rail transport|rail]].  Each form has its own cost associated with 'speed of movement', which is affected by friction, place of origin, and destination.  [[Ship]]s are generally used for moving large amounts of goods.  Maritime [[shipping]] is able to carry more around the world at a cheaper cost.   For moving people who prefer to minimize travel time and maximize comfort and convenience, road and air are the most common modes in use. A railroad is often used to transport goods in areas away from water. Railroads may also be the source of transportation for people as well.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
" Transportation modes are an essential component of transport systems since they are the means by which mobility is supported. Geographers consider a wide range of modes that may be grouped into three broad categories based on the medium they exploit: land, water and air. Each mode has its own requirements and features, and is adapted to serve the specific demands of freight and passenger traffic. This gives rise to marked differences in the ways the modes are deployed and used in different parts of the world. Recently, there is a trend towards integrating the modes through intermodality and linking the modes ever more closely into production and distribution activities. At the same time; however, passenger and freight activity is becoming increasingly separated across most modes." &lt;ref&gt;Dr. [[Jean-Paul Rodrigue]], Dept. of Economics &amp; Geography, Hofstra University&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Road transportation===
{{Main|Road transport}}
Road transportation networks are connected with movements on constructed roads; carrying people and goods from one place to another by means of lorries, cars, etc. Transportation may be further categorized by the vehicle used or the purpose for transport itself.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Maritime transportation===
{{Main|Maritime transport}}
Water transportation is the slowest form of transportation in the movement of goods and people.
Strategic chokepoints around the world have continued to play significant roles in maritime industry. Although the slowest form of transportation compared to road and rail transport, it is the most cost effective.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

=== Rail Transportation ===

[[Rail transport]]ation is the movement of cargo, goods, and passengers on trains as a form of transportation. Transportation by rails has been established as one of the safest modes of transportation over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://election.princeton.edu/2015/05/13/train-travel-is-incredibly-safe/|title=Train travel is incredibly safe|access-date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges for transportation==
[[File:Seattle Traffic.jpg|thumb|Seattle traffic at I-5 and Yesler Way]]
Transportation availability on existing streets, highways, and rail facilities no longer match the transportation demands created by subsequent population growth and new location patterns of economic activity. Besides an increase in population, another problem is vehicles overloading the network of highways and arterial streets. See [[Traffic congestion]], [[Transport network|Transportation network]], and [[Population densities]]

The well-being of poor people and people who live in developing areas can be threatened by systems of transportation that fail to connect them to jobs and medical assistance. For example, areas of [[Southern California]] have transportation systems that do not connect the homeless to these necessities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laris|first1=William G.

{{Crossdressing}}

'''Transvestic fetishism''' is a psychiatric diagnosis applied to those who are thought to have an excessive sexual or erotic interest in [[cross-dressing]]; this interest is often expressed in [[Autoeroticism|autoerotic]] behavior.  It differs from cross-dressing for entertainment or other purposes that do not involve [[sexual arousal]], and is categorized as a [[paraphilia]] in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association.&lt;ref name="DSM-5-paraphillic"&gt;{{Cite book
| first=
| last= American Psychiatric Association
| year= 2013
| title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
| edition=Fifth
| publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing
| location=Arlington, VA
| pages=685–705
| isbn= 978-0-89042-555-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Sexual arousal in response to donning sex-typical clothing is [[homeovestism]].)

== Description ==
Males with late onset gender dysphoria "frequently engage in transvestic behavior with sexual excitement," which could include transvestic fetishism. "Habitual fetishistic tranvestism developing into [[autogynephilia]]" is given a risk factor for [[gender dysphoria]] to develop. &lt;ref&gt;[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], [[DSM-5|5th ed.]], p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some male transvestic fetishists collect women's [[clothing]], e.g. [[panties]], [[nightgown]]s, [[babydoll]]s, [[bridal gown]]s, [[Slip (clothing)|slips]], [[brassiere]]s, and other types of [[nightwear]], [[lingerie]], [[stockings]], [[pantyhose]], [[shoes]], and [[boots]], items of a distinct feminine look and feel. They may dress in these feminine garments and take photographs of themselves while living out their fantasies. 

According to DSM-IV, this fetishism was limited to [[heterosexual]] men; however, DSM-5 does not have this restriction, and opens it to women and men with this interest, regardless of their sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Paraphilic%20Disorders%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf DSM-5 Documents: Paraphilic Disorders Fact Sheet&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two key criteria before a psychiatric diagnosis of "transvestic fetishism" is made:&lt;ref name=DSM&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (4th ed., text rev.). Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Individuals must be sexually aroused by the act of cross-dressing.
# Individuals must experience significant distress or impairment – socially or occupationally – because of their behavior.

'''[[Canada]]''' shares many of the concerns particularly prevalent in the developed and developing world about the current and future roles of '''[[women in computing]]''', especially as these occupations increase in importance. As in much of the world where [[computing]] and information technology is a large industry, women have historically faced underrepresentation in education and industry. As a result, some Canadian women pursuing careers in these fields have had a lack of [[role model]]s and faced [[sexism]]. There are many institutions and initiatives in Canada, however, which seek to increase representation for women in computing fields, as well as the fields of [[natural science]] and [[engineering]] in general.

==Inequalities==

===In education===
As is typical in North America, the enrollment for women in computing disciplines at the post-secondary level is significantly lower than for males. According to [[Statistics Canada]], in 2009, there were 33,219 students nationwide enrolled in "Mathematics, computer and information sciences", with only 9,075 of them being women (27%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University enrolment by field of study and gender|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/100714/t100714a2-eng.htm|work=Statistics Canada|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is significantly lower than 3 years earlier (2005/2006), when the percentage of women was 37%. The fact that, in general, the enrollment of women in computer science and related disciplines is actually declining is mirrored in the US.&lt;ref name="mainarticle"&gt;See the main article on [[women in computing]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another summary published by Statistics Canada shows that this trend is not recent; between 1992 and 2007, the number of annual female university graduates in computer science has remained roughly constant (with a slight increase between 2000 and 2004), whereas the number of male graduates has increased approximately 50% (with the 2004 value almost double that of the 1992 value).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trends in University Graduation, 1992 to 2007|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/81-004-x/2009005/article/11050-eng.htm|work=Statistics Canada|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatively speaking, there were about twice as many male graduates as female in 1992, and three times as many in 2007.

A study looking at enrollment based on program and gender was done at the [[University of Waterloo]] in 2010, and the results were especially egregious (even compared to the nationwide statistics from the previous year). At Waterloo, the percentage of the undergraduate population in computer science that were women was only 11.5%, with a slight increase at the Master's (18.4%) and PhD (17.1%) levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where the boys are and aren't|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/alumni/alumni-publications/waterloo-magazine/where-boys-are-and-arent|work=University of Waterloo Magazine|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waterloo, being one of the only universities in Canada to have a higher percentage of male students than female, is an extreme example, but the trend is constant across many computer science departments in the country.

===In the workforce===
As of 2011, the GDP of the Canadian Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) sector was $62.7 billion, and grew at an annualized rate of 3.8% between 2002 and 2011 compared to 1.9% for the overall economy, reflecting the importance of the industry in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICT Sector Gross Domestic Product (GDP)|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/ict-tic.nsf/eng/h_it05864.html|work=Industry Canada|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this importance, the percentage of women working in the industry unsurprisingly mirrored that of the percentage of women receiving computing education. Statistics Canada reports that in 2012, there were approximately 1,299,300 people employed in the "Professional, scientific and technical services", of which only 548,800 were women (42%). This category also includes those working in [[law|legal]] and [[accounting]] services (which are typically much more gender balanced), so the actual percentage working in the computing field is likely much lower than this.

==Attempts to address inequalities==
Although the reasons for the lack of participation of women are multifaceted and are not fully understood, it is accepted that they partly stem from the perceived image of the field, a lack of understanding of what work in the field consists of, and a lack of encouragement.&lt;ref name="mainarticle" /&gt; Correspondingly, many institutions (both ones that are independently organized and ones that are funded by the [[Government of Canada]] through universities) have come into existence to inform and encourage potential computing students. As well, many universities and other organizations offer gender-specific scholarships in attempts to increase enrollment numbers.

===Institutions and organizations===
[[Image:Ladies Learning Code event, November 26 2011.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A Ladies Learning Code workshop in Toronto.]]

Canada has several not-for-profit organizations dedicated to supporting women in computing disciplines.

* [[Ladies Learning Code]] is a [[Toronto]]-based not-for-profit which hosts events for women in computing and has a community outreach program. The same founders also have recently formed Girls Learning Code, which hosts technology camps and workshops for "Toronto's most creative 9 to 13-year-old girls".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://girlslearningcode.com/about|work=Girls Learning Code|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Chic Geek]] is a [[Calgary]]-based not-for-profit which creates opportunities for women to explore their geeky sides, inspire one another, and build meaningful personal and professional relationships.  They organize technical workshops for women and girls as well as networking events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://thechicgeek.ca|work=Chic Geek|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pixelles]] is a [[Montreal]]-based not-for-profit which hosts incubators and follow along programming to help women learn  skills to develop [[video games]].

Many Canadian universities also have resources designed for women in underrepresented disciplines such as computer science.

* The [[University of Toronto]] hosts monthly lunches for all female students and faculty in Computer Science, and a mailing list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in Computer Science|url=http://web.cs.toronto.edu/people/dcswomen.htm|work=University of Toronto|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[University of British Columbia]] has a "Focus on Women in Computing (FoWCS)" committee which aims to increase the participation of women in computer science "at all academic levels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Focus On Women In Computing|url=https://www.cs.ubc.ca/our-department/administration/committees/women|work=University of British Columbia|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Simon Fraser University]] has a Women in Computing Science (WICS) group that hosts professional networking events, technical workshops, outreach programs, and social activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in Computer Science|url=https://wics.cs.sfu.ca|work=Simon Fraser University|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[University of Waterloo]] has a Women in Computer Science organization (WICS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in Computer Science|url=https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/wics|work=University of Waterloo|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The School of Computing at [[Queen's University]] has a Women in Computer Science organization (WISC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in the School of Computing|url=https://www.cs.queensu.ca/wisc|work=School of Computing at Queen's University|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initiatives and scholarships===
Several scholarships exist for Canadian women in computing (some of which being international).

*[[Google]] Canada offers the [[Anita Borg]] Memorial Scholarship for outstanding female Canadian undergraduates and graduates in Computer Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Google Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship: Canada|url=http://www.google.ca/anitaborg/|work=Google|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* UBC offers a scholarship for upper-year computer science, with preference to female candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SIMBA Technologies Award in Computer Science|url=https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/resources/awards-and-scholarships|work=University of British Columbia|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many universities also have programs in place to encourage interest in computer science, especially for high school students.

* Waterloo's Centre for Education in Mathematics and Computing holds an annual workshop in computer science for young women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CEMC Workshop in Computer Science for Young Women|url=http://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/events/csgirls.html|work=University of Waterloo|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which students from across the country can apply for and are accepted into through a lottery system.

===Celebrations of Women in Computing Events===

Several region-based celebrations, modelled after the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women conference, have taken place over the past several years in conjunction with the ACM-W:

The [http://www.oncwic.ca Ontario Celebration of Women in Computing] (ONCWIC):
* 2010 - Kingston, ON - Chair: Wendy Powley, Queen's University
* 2011 - Toronto, ON -  Co-Chairs:  Kelly Lyons &amp; Renée J. Miller, University of Toronto
* 2012 - London, ON - Chair:  Hanan Lutfiyya, Western University
* 2013 - Kitchener/Waterloo, ON - Chair:  Kate Larson, University of Waterloo
* 2014 - to be held in Guelph, ON - Chair: Rozita Dara, University of Guelph

The Atlantic Celebration of Women in Computing:
*2011 - Sackville, NB - Chair: Laurie Ricker, Mt. Allison University

The Pacific Northwest Celebration of Women in Computing:
* 2014 - to be held in Vancouver, BC - Chair:  Anne Condon, University of British Columbia

In 2014/2015, Ontario Celebration of Women in Computing and Pacific Northwest Celebration of Women in Computing joined forces and became the [https://www.can-cwic.ca/ Canadian Celebration of Women in Computing] (CAN-CWiC):
*2016 - Ottawa, ON
*2017 - Montreal, QC
*2018 - Halifax, NS

== International comparison ==
Many of the statistics reported by Canadian studies and agencies are similar to those found in North America as a whole. In the US, the percentage of computer science degrees awarded to women dropped from 37.1% to 26.7% between 1984 and 1998. As well, a recent survey indicated that less than 12% were awarded to women in 2010-2011.&lt;ref name="mainarticle" /&gt; Like Canada, the US has many scholarships and initiatives in place to attempt to address this (e.g., the [[Anita Borg]] Institute).

Asia exhibits some different trends. In [[Southeast Asia]], a more equal gender distribution in the discipline has been reported.&lt;ref name="mainarticle" /&gt; Cultural reasons have been cited for this, as well as the perception that computing is an employable field, which results in greater parental encouragement to pursue careers in the field regardless of gender. The percentage of students who are women enrolled in undergraduate computer science programs was 51.4% in Malaysia in 1991, greater than 50% in Singapore in 1987, and 55% in Thailand in 1998.&lt;ref name="vashti"&gt;Vashti Galpin. 2002. [http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/543812.543839 Women in computing around the world]. ''SIGCSE Bull''. 34, 2 (June 2002), 94-100.&lt;/ref&gt; In India, women graduates from [[IIT Bombay]] in engineering grew from 1.8% in 1972 to 8% in 2005,&lt;ref name="mainarticle" /&gt; which, although still low, is the opposite of the downward trend observed in North America.

The statistics for Europe show an even smaller participation than North America for some countries, and a slightly higher participation for others (primarily [[Scandinavia]]n countries). The Czech Republic had 9.6% women enrolled in 2001, Germany had 10.5% in 2000, the Netherlands had 6.6% in 1999, Slovenia had 6.7% in 1999, and Switzerland had 11.4% in 2001. By contrast, Finland had 20% in 1997, Iceland had 24% in 2000, Norway had 23.2% in 1999, and Sweden had 30% in 2000. The United Kingdom was approximately in the middle at 19% in 1999.&lt;ref name="vashti" /&gt;
