'''Anupalabdhi'''  ([[Sanskrit]]: अनुपलब्धि) means 'non-recognition', 'non-perception'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=Vaman Shivram apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=anupalabdhi&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This word refers to the [[Pramāṇa|Pramana]] of Non-perception which consists in the presentative knowledge of negative facts. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Oriental Philosophy and Religion |author=|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|page=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uec1E8DpiH8C&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=anupalabdhi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RUIuU4Y1h9StB8D9gOAB&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=anupalabdhi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Anupalabdhi'' or ''abhāvapramāṇa'' is the Pramana of Non-perception admitted by [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa|Kumārila]] for the perception of non-existence of a thing. He holds that the non-existence of a thing cannot be perceived by the senses for there is nothing with which the senses could come into contact in order to perceive the non-existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Indian Philosophy Vol.1|author=Surendranath Dasgupta|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=397|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PoaMFmS1_lEC&amp;pg=PA397&amp;dq=anupalabdhi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RUIuU4Y1h9StB8D9gOAB&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=anupalabdhi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Bhāṭṭa school of Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā and [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita-Vedānta]] system of philosophy, Anupalabdhi is a way to apprehend an absence;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical Indian Philosophy|author=Jitendranath Mohanty|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=asxruhA1DRgC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=anupalabdhi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RUIuU4Y1h9StB8D9gOAB&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=anupalabdhi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is regarded as the source of knowledge, the other five being – ''[[pratyaksha|pratyakṣa]]'' ('perception'), ''[[anumana|anumāna]]'' ('inference'), ''[[shabda|śabda]]'' ('testimony'), ''upamāna'' ('comparison') and ''arthāpatti'' ('presumption'). The perception of negation or non-existence in its various forms is also due to the relation of attributiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Padartha Vijnana|author=Y.C.Mishra|publisher=Chaukhambha Publications|page=392,465|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uuywLu-DxPIC&amp;pg=PA465&amp;dq=anupalabdhi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RUIuU4Y1h9StB8D9gOAB&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=anupalabdhi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All things exist in places either in a positive (''sadrupa'') or in a negative (''asadrūpa'') relation, and it is only in the former case that they come into contact with the senses, while in the latter case the perception of the negative existence can only be had by a separate mode of movement of the mind, a separate ''pramāṇa'' – ''anupalabdhi''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Systems of Indian Philosophy|publisher=Genesis Publishing|page=409|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8oEpPOKtrbkC&amp;pg=PA409&amp;dq=anupalabdhi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RUIuU4Y1h9StB8D9gOAB&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=anupalabdhi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Indirect knowledge of non-existence can be attained by other means but direct knowledge of non-existence of perceptible objects and their attributes is available only through this kind of ''pramāṇa'' which is not inference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Accomplishing the Accomplished|author=Anantanand Rambachan|publisher=University of Hawaii|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9FlsBa8FWlIC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=anupalabdhi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BkYuU5WtFsfirAfA24HYDA&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=anupalabdhi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four  verities of ''Anupalabdhi'' which have been identified, they are  – a) ''kāraṇa-anupalabdhi'' or 'non-perception of the causal condition', b) ''vyāpaka-anupalabdhi'' or 'non-perception of the pervader', c) ''svabhāva-anupalabdhi'' or 'non-perception of presence of itself', and d) ''viruddha-anupalabdhi'' or 'non-perception of the opposed'. The lack of perceptible (''yogya'') adjuncts (''upādhi'') is known through non-perception of what is perceptible (''yogya-anupalabdhi'') and the lack of imperceptible adjuncts is known by showing that which is thought to be an adjunct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical Indian Philosophy of Induction|author=Kisor Kumar Chakraborti|publisher=Lexington Books|page=278,146|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2xhSHlppPQC&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=anupalabdhi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RUIuU4Y1h9StB8D9gOAB&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=anupalabdhi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The followers of [[Prabhākara]] and the [[Viśiṣṭādvaita|Vishishtadvaita]] do not accept ''anupalabdhi'' as a separate ''parmāṇa'' because the same sense organs which apprehend an entity can also cognize its ''abhāva'' or the non-existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tattvamuktakalapa|author=S.M.Srinivasa Chari|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un1i5icdpdoC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=anupalabdhi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RUIuU4Y1h9StB8D9gOAB&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=anupalabdhi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Dharmakīrti|Dharmakirti]], ''anupalabdhi'' is the affirmative assertion of a negative prediction, and is same as ''anumāna'' of an ''abhāva''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Contrary Thinking|author=Daya Krishna|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=121,125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a44AHKGef64C&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=anupalabdhi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BkYuU5WtFsfirAfA24HYDA&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=anupalabdhi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Evidence law}}

In the law of the United States, '''attorney–client privilege''' or '''lawyer–client privilege''' is a "client's right privilege to refuse to disclose and to prevent any other person from disclosing confidential communications between the client and the attorney."&lt;ref&gt;"Attorney–client privilege", ''Black's Law Dictionary'', p. 1391 col. 2 (Bryan A. Garner 10th ed. 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The attorney–client privilege is one of the oldest recognized privileges for confidential communications.&lt;ref name="Swidler"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Swidler &amp; Berlin v. United States |vol=524 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=399 |pinpoint=[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15126544245741859873#p403 403] |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Supreme Court has stated that by assuring confidentiality, the privilege encourages clients to make "full and frank" disclosures to their attorneys, who are then better able to provide candid advice and effective representation.&lt;ref&gt;''Upjohn Co. v. United States,'' 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

==General requirements under United States law==
Although there are minor variations, the elements necessary to establish the attorney client privilege generally are:

# The asserted holder of the privilege is (or sought to become) a client; and
# The person to whom the communication was made:
## is a member of the bar of a court, or a subordinate of such a member, and
## in connection with this communication, is acting as an attorney; and
# The communication was for the purpose of securing legal advice.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Colton v. United States'', 306 F.2d 633, 637 (2d Cir. 1962), ''cert. denied'', 371 U.S. 951, 83 S. Ct. 505 (1963), ''citing'' ''United States v. United Shoe Mach. Corp.'', 89 F. Supp. 357, 358–59 (D. Mass. 1950).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of exceptions to the privilege in most jurisdictions, chief among them:
#the communication was made in the presence of individuals who were neither attorney nor client, or was disclosed to such individuals,
#the communication was made for the purpose of committing a crime or tort,
#the client has waived the privilege (for example by publicly disclosing the communication).

A corollary to the attorney–client privilege is the [[joint defense privilege]], which is also called the [[common interest rule]].&lt;ref name=Laforest3&gt;''LaForest v. Honeywell International Inc.'', 2004 WL 1498916, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The common interest rule "serves to protect the confidentiality of communications passing from one party to another party where a joint defense or strategy has been decided upon and undertaken by the parties and their respective counsel."&lt;ref name=Laforest3/&gt;

An attorney speaking publicly in regard to a client's personal business and private affairs can be reprimanded by the bar and/or disbarred, regardless of the fact that he or she may be no longer representing the client. Discussing a client's or past client's criminal history, or otherwise, is viewed as a breach of confidentiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_6_confidentiality_of_information.html |title= Client-Lawyer Relationship Rule 1.6 Confidentiality of Information |website=www.americanbar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attorney–client privilege is separate from and should not be confused with the [[work-product doctrine]].

==When the privilege may not apply==
When an attorney is not acting primarily as an attorney but, for instance, as a business advisor, member of the Board of Directors, or in another non-legal role, then the privilege generally does not apply.&lt;ref&gt;''North Pacifica, LLC v. City of Pacifica,'' 274 F.Supp.2d 1118, 1127 (N.D. Cal 2003); ''Handguards, Inc. v. Johnson &amp; Johnson,'' 69 F.R.D. 451, 453 (N.D. Cal 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

The privilege protects the confidential communication, and not the underlying information.  For instance, if a client has previously disclosed confidential information to a third party who is not an attorney, and then gives the same information to an attorney, the attorney–client privilege will still protect the communication to the attorney, but will not protect the communication with the third party.

The privilege may be waived if the confidential communications are disclosed to third parties.

Other limits to the privilege may apply depending on the situation being adjudicated.

===Disclosure in case of a crime, tort, or fraud===
The crime-fraud exception can render the privilege moot when communications between an attorney and client are themselves used to further a crime, [[tort]], or fraud. In ''Clark v. United States'', the [[US Supreme Court]] stated that "A client who consults an attorney for advice that will serve him in the commission of a fraud will have no help from the law. He must let the truth be told."&lt;ref&gt;''Clark v. United States'', 289 U.S. 1, 15 (1933)&lt;/ref&gt; The crime-fraud exception also ''does'' require that the crime or fraud discussed between client and attorney be carried out to be triggered.&lt;ref&gt;In re Grand Jury Subpoena of Francis D. Carter, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19597 (citing In re Sealed Case, 107 F.3d 46, 49, 51 (D.C. Cir. 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; US Courts have not yet conclusively ruled how little knowledge an attorney can have of the underlying crime or fraud before the privilege detaches and the attorney's communications or requisite testimony become admissible.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. ''United States v. Bauer'' 132 F.3d 504 (9th Cir. 1997) vs. ''In re Grand Jury Proceedings'' (1996) (9th Cir. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disclosure ostensibly to support lawyer's own interests===
Lawyers may disclose confidential information relating to the retainer where they are reasonably seeking to collect payment for services rendered. This is justified on policy grounds. If lawyers were unable to disclose such information, many would undertake legal work only where payment is made in advance. This would arguably adversely affect the public's access to justice.

Lawyers may also breach the duty where they are defending themselves against disciplinary or legal proceedings. A client who initiates  proceedings against a lawyer effectively waives rights to confidentiality. This is justified on grounds of procedural fairness—a lawyer unable to reveal information relating to the retainer would be unable to defend themselves against such action.

===Disclosure for the purpose of probate===
{{see also|Probate court|Surrogate's court}}
Another case is for the [[probate]] of a [[last will and testament]]. Previously confidential communications between the lawyer and [[testator]] may be disclosed in order to prove that a will represented the intent of the now deceased [[decedent]]. In many instances, the will, [[codicil (will)|codicil]], or other parts of the [[Estate planning|estate plan]] require explanation or interpretation through other proof (extrinsic evidence), such as the attorney's file notes or correspondence from the client.

In certain cases, the client may desire or consent to revelation of personal or family secrets only after his or her death; for example, the will may leave a [[legacy (property law)|legacy]] to a [[paramour]] or a [[natural child]].

Courts have occasionally revoked the privilege after the death of the client if it is deemed that doing so serves the client's intent, such as in the case of resolving testamentary disputes among heirs.

==Tax practice==
In the United States, communications between accountants and their clients are usually not privileged. A person who is worried about accusations of questionable accounting, such as [[tax evasion]], may decide to work only with an attorney or only with an accountant who is also an attorney; some or all of the resulting communications may be privileged provided that all the requirements for the attorney–client privilege are met. The mere fact that the practitioner is an attorney will not create a valid attorney–client privilege with respect to a communication, for example, that involves business or accounting advice rather than legal advice.

Under Federal tax law in the United States, for communications on or after July 22, 1998, there is a limited Federally authorized [[accountant–client privilege]] that may apply to certain communications with non–attorneys.

==In the federal courts==
If a case arises in the federal court system, the federal court will apply Rule 501 of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] to determine whether to apply the privilege law of the relevant state or federal common law.  If the case is brought to the federal court under [[diversity jurisdiction]], the law of the relevant state will be used to apply the privilege.  If the case involves a [[federal question]], the federal court will apply the federal common law of attorney–client privilege; however, Rule 501 grants flexibility to the federal courts, allowing them to construe the privilege "in light of experience and reason".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3120">'''Authority bias''' is the tendency to attribute greater accuracy to the opinion of an [[authority]] figure (unrelated to its content) and be more [[social influence|influenced]] by that opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Milgram |first=Stanley |authorlink=Stanley Milgram |date=July 1963 |title=Behavioral Study of obedience |journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology |volume=67 |issue=4 |pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Milgram experiment]] in 1961 was the classic experiment that established its existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ellis RM |title=Middle Way Philosophy: Omnibus Edition |year=2015 |publisher=[[Lulu (company)|Lulu Press]] | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xG9rCgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Ellis+RM+Middle+Way+Philosophy%3A+Omnibus+Edition&amp;q=authority#v=onepage&amp;q=milgram&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans usually have deep-seated duty to authority, and tend to [[compliance (psychology)|comply]] when requested by an authority figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Stanley |last=Milgram |authorlink=Stanley Milgram |title=Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any society, a diverse and widely accepted system of authority allows the development of sophisticated structures for the production of resources, trade, expansion and [[social control]]. Since the opposite is [[anarchy]], we are all trained from birth to believe that [[obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] to authority is right. Notions of submission and [[loyalty]] to legitimate rule of others are accorded values in schools, the law, the military and in political systems. The strength of the bias to obey a legitimate authority figure comes from systemic [[socialization]] practices designed to instill in people the perception that such obedience constitutes correct behavior. Different societies vary the terms of this dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|last1=Hinnosaar| first1=Marit| last2=Hinnosaar| first2=Toomas| title=Authority Bias| date=August 31, 2012 |url=https://www.academia.edu/2108445/Authority_Bias}}&lt;/ref&gt; As we grow up, we learn that it benefits us to obey the dictates of genuine authority figures because such individuals usually possess higher degrees of knowledge, wisdom and [[Power (social and political)|power]]. We tend to do what our doctor advises. Consequently, [[deference]] to authority can occur in a mindless fashion as a kind of [[decision-making]] short cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Huczynski| first=Andrzej| title=Influencing within organizations| publisher=[[Routledge]]| year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contains Indic text}}

In [[Buddhism]], '''buddhahood''' ({{lang-sa|buddhatva}}; {{lang-pi|buddhatta}} or {{lang|pi|buddhabhāva|italic=no}}; Chinese: 佛果) is the condition or rank of a [[Buddha (title)|buddha]] "awakened one".&lt;ref&gt;buddhatva, बुद्धत्व. [http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=buddhatva&amp;trans=%E7%BF%BB%E8%A8%B3&amp;direction=AU Spoken Sanskrit Dictionary]. (accessed: January 10, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of [[Mahayana]]'s [[bodhisattva]] path is Samyaksambuddhahood, so that one may benefit all sentient beings by teaching them the path of cessation of ''[[dukkha]]''.&lt;ref name=gethin1998p224&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gethin|first1=Rupert|title=The foundations of Buddhism|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford [England]|isbn=0-19-289223-1|pages=224–234|edition=1. publ. paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahayana theory contrasts this with the goal of the [[Theravada]] path, where the goal is individual [[arhat]]ship.&lt;ref name=gethin1998p224/&gt;

==Explanation of the term ''Buddha''==
{{Buddhism}}
In [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]], ''Buddha'' refers to one who has become [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awake]] through their own efforts and insight, without a teacher to point out the [[dharma]] (Sanskrit; Pali ''dhamma''; "right way of living"). A samyaksambuddha teaches the dharma to others after his awakening. A [[pratyekabuddha]] also reaches Nirvana through his own efforts, but does not teach the dharma to others. An [[arhat]] needs to follow the teaching of a Buddha to attain Nirvana, but can also preach the dharma after attaining Nirvana.&lt;ref name="Snelling, John 1987 Page 81"&gt;Snelling, John (1987), ''The Buddhist handbook. A Complete Guide to Buddhist Teaching and Practice''. London: Century Paperbacks. Page 81&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance the term buddha is also used in Theravada to refer to all who attain [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]], using the term [[Sāvakabuddha]] to designate an arhat, someone who depends on the teachings of a Buddha to attain Nirvana.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;''Udana Commentary''. Translation Peter Masefield, volume I, 1994. Pali Text Society. page 94.&lt;/ref&gt; In this broader sense it is equivalent to the arhat.

Buddhahood is the state of an awakened being, who having found the path of cessation of [[dukkha]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gethin|first1=Rupert|title=The foundations of Buddhism|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford [England]|isbn=0-19-289223-1|page=32|edition=1. publ. paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("suffering", as created by attachment to desires and distorted perception and thinking) is in the state of "No-more-Learning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Damien Keown |author2=Charles S. Prebish |title=Encyclopedia of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NFpcAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-98588-1|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rinpoche Karma-raṅ-byuṅ-kun-khyab-phrin-las|title=The Dharma: That Illuminates All Beings Impartially Like the Light of the Sun and Moon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4wVW91BLAYC |year=1986|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-156-1|pages=32–33}}; Quote: "There are various ways of examining the Complete Path. For example, we can speak of Five Paths constituting its different levels: the Path of Accumulation, the Path of Application, the Path of Seeing, the Path of Meditation and the Path of No More Learning, or Buddhahood."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E. Buswell|author2=Robert M. Gimello|title=Paths to liberation: the Mārga and its transformations in Buddhist thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hu0oIf0n87IC |year=1990|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1253-9|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a broad spectrum of opinion on the universality and method of attainment of Buddhahood, depending on [[Gautama Buddha]]'s teachings that a school of Buddhism emphasizes. The level to which this manifestation requires [[ascetic]] practices varies from none at all to an absolute requirement, dependent on doctrine. Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes the [[bodhisattva]] ideal instead of the Arhat.

The Tathagatagarba and [[Buddha-nature]] doctrines of Mahayana Buddhism consider Buddhahood to be a universal and innate property of absolute wisdom. This wisdom is revealed in a person's current lifetime through Buddhist practice, without any specific relinquishment of pleasures or "earthly desires".

Buddhists do not consider Gautama to have been the only Buddha. The [[Pāli Canon]] refers to many previous ones (see [[list of the named Buddhas]]), while the Mahayana tradition additionally has many Buddhas of celestial origin (see [[Amitābha]] or [[Vairocana]] as examples, for lists of many thousands of Buddha names (see ''[[Taishō Tripiṭaka]]'' numbers 439–448).

==Nature of the Buddha==
{{further|Buddhology}}
The various Buddhist schools hold some varying interpretations on the nature of Buddha (see below).

===Attainments===
[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|The Buddha, in [[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist style]], first-second century, [[Gandhara]] (now Pakistan). ([[Standing Buddha]]).]]
All Buddhist traditions hold that a Buddha is fully awakened and has completely purified his mind of the [[three poisons]] of [[taṇhā|craving]], [[Dvesha_(Buddhism)|aversion]] and [[avidyā (Buddhism)|ignorance]]. A Buddha is no longer bound by [[saṃsāra]], and has ended the [[Dukkha|suffering]] which unawakened people experience in life.

Most schools of Buddhism have also held that the Buddha was [[omniscience|omniscient]]. However, the early texts contain explicit repudiations of making this claim of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. K. Warder]], ''Indian Buddhism.'' Third edition published by Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 2000, pages 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalupahana|first=David|authorlink=David Kalupahana|title=A History of Buddhist Philosophy: Continuities and Discontinuities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlDArya3YvcC&amp;pg=PA43|year=1992|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1402-1|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ten characteristics of a Buddha===
Some Buddhists meditate on (or contemplate) the Buddha as having ten characteristics (Ch./Jp. 十號). These characteristics are frequently mentioned in the Pāli Canon as well as Mahayana teachings, and are chanted daily in many Buddhist monasteries:
#Thus gone, thus come (Skt: ''{{IAST|[[tathāgata]]}}'')
#Worthy one (Skt: ''[[arhat]]'')
#Perfectly self-enlightened (Skt: ''{{IAST|samyak-saṃbuddha}}'')
#Perfected in knowledge and conduct (Skt: ''{{IAST|vidyā-caraṇa-saṃpanna}}'' )
#Well gone (Skt: ''sugata'')
#Knower of the world (Skt: ''lokavida'')
#Unsurpassed (Skt: ''anuttara'')
#Leader of persons to be tamed (Skt: ''{{IAST|puruṣa-damya-sārathi}}'')
#Teacher of the gods and humans (Skt: ''{{IAST|śāsta deva-manuṣyāṇaṃ}}'')
#The Blessed One or fortunate one (Skt: ''bhagavat'')&lt;ref&gt;Japanese-English Buddhist Dictionary (Daitō shuppansha) 147a/163&lt;/ref&gt;

The tenth epithet is sometimes listed as "The World Honored Enlightened One" (Skt. ''Buddha-Lokanatha'') or "The Blessed Enlightened One" (Skt. ''Buddha-Bhagavan'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tientai.net/teachings/dharma/buddha/10titles.htm], also see [[Thomas Cleary]] and [[J. C. Cleary]] ''The Blue Cliff Record'', page 553.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddha as a supreme human===
In the Pāli Canon, Gautama Buddha is known as being a "teacher of the gods and humans", superior to both the gods and humans in the sense of having [[nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]] or the greatest bliss, whereas the [[deva (Buddhism)|devas]], or gods, are still subject to anger, fear and sorrow.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

In the Madhupindika Sutta (MN 18),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.018.than.html Majhima Nikaya 18 Madhupindika Sutta: The Ball of Honey]&lt;/ref&gt; Buddha is described in powerful terms as the Lord of the Dhamma (Pali: Dhammasami, skt.: Dharma Swami) and the bestower of immortality (Pali: Amatassadata).

Similarly, in the ''Anuradha Sutta'' (SN 44.2)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn44/sn44.002.than.html Sutta Nikaya 44.2 Anuradha Sutta: To Anuradha]&lt;/ref&gt; Buddha is described as 
{{quote|the Tathagata—the supreme man, the superlative man, attainer of the superlative attainment.&lt;br/&gt;[Buddha is asked about what happens to the Tathagatha after death of the physical body. Buddha replies],&lt;br/&gt;"And so, Anuradha—when you can't pin down the Tathagata as a truth or reality even in the present life—is it proper for you to declare, 'Friends, the Tathagata—the supreme man, the superlative man, attainer of the superlative attainment—being described, is described otherwise than with these four positions: The Tathagata exists after death, does not exist after death, both does &amp; does not exist after death, neither exists nor does not exist after death'?}}

In the Vakkali Sutta (SN 22.87) Buddha identifies himself with the Dhamma:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.087x.wlsh.html Sutta Nikaya 22.87 Vakkali Sutta: Vakkali]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|O Vakkali, whoever sees the Dhamma, sees me [the Buddha]}}

Another reference from the [[Aggañña Sutta]] of the [[Digha Nikaya]], says to his disciple Vasettha:
{{quote|O Vasettha! The Word of Dhammakaya is indeed the name of the Tathagata}}

[[Shravasti Dhammika]], a Theravada monk, writes:

{{quote|In the centuries after his final Nibbāna it sometimes got to the stage that the legends and myths obscured the very real human being behind them and the Buddha came to be looked upon as a god. Actually, the Buddha was a human being, not a 'mere human being' as is sometimes said but a special class of human called a 'complete person' (mahāparisa). Such complete persons are born no different from others and indeed they physically remain quite ordinary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dhammika|first=Shravasti|authorlink=Shravasti Dhammika|title=The Buddha and His Disciples|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society|year=2005|page=16|ISBN=9789552402807}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Sangharakshita]] also states that "The first thing we have to understand - and this is very important - is that the Buddha is a human being. But a special kind of human being, in fact the highest kind, so far as we know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sangharakshita|authorlink=Sangharakshita|title=A Guide to the Buddhist Path|publisher=Windhorse Publications|year=1996|page=45|ISBN=9781899579044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddha as "just a human"===

When asked whether he was a [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]] or a human, he replied that he had eliminated the deep-rooted unconscious traits that would make him either one, and should instead be called a Buddha; one who had grown up in the world but had now gone beyond it, as a lotus grows from the water but blossoms above it, unsoiled.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History, and Practices.'' Cambridge University Press, 1990, page 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Skilton writes that the Buddha was never historically regarded by Buddhist traditions as being merely human:&lt;ref&gt;Skilton, Andrew. ''A Concise History of Buddhism.'' 2004. pp. 64-65&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It is important to stress that, despite modern Theravada teachings to the contrary (often a sop to skeptical Western pupils), he was never seen as being merely human. For instance, he is often described as having the thirty-two major and eighty minor marks or signs of a ''mahāpuruṣa'', "superman"; the Buddha himself denied that he was either a man or a [[Deva (Buddhism)|god]]; and in the ''[[Mahaparinibbana Sutta|Mahāparinibbāna Sutta]]'' he states that he could live for an [[Kalpa (aeon)|aeon]] were he asked to do so.}}

However, [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]], a [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]] in the [[Zen]] tradition, states that "Buddha was not a god. He was a human being like you and me, and he suffered just as we do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nhất Hạnh|first=Thích|authorlink=Thích Nhất Hạnh|title=The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching|publisher=[[Broadway Books]]|year=1999|page=3|ISBN=0-7679-0369-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack Maguire writes that Buddha is inspirational based on his humanness.

{{quote|A fundamental part of Buddhism's appeal to billions of people over the past two and a half millennia is the fact that the central figure, commonly referred to by the title "Buddha", was not a god, or a special kind of spiritual being, or even a prophet or an emissary of one. On the contrary, he was a human being like the rest of us who quite simply woke up to full aliveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maguire|first=Jack|title=Essential Buddhism|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|year=2013|page=2|ISBN=9781476761961}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Nichiren]], the founder of [[Nichiren]] [[Buddhism]] states that the real meaning of the Lord Shakyamuni Buddha’s appearance in this world lay in his behavior as a human being.

===Mahāsāṃghika supramundane Buddha===
In the early Buddhist schools, the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] branch regarded the buddhas as being characterized primarily by their supramundane nature. The Mahāsāṃghikas advocated the transcendental and supramundane nature of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and the fallibility of arhats.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1b"&gt;Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism.'' 2008. p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 48 special theses attributed by the ''Samayabhedoparacanacakra'' to the Mahāsāṃghika [[Ekavyāvahārika]], [[Lokottaravāda]], and the [[Kukkuṭika]], 20 points concern the supramundane nature of buddhas and bodhisattvas.&lt;ref&gt;Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' 2008. p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Samayabhedoparacanacakra'', these four groups held that the Buddha is able to know all dharmas in a single moment of the mind.&lt;ref name="Yao, Zhihua 2005. p. 11"&gt;Yao, Zhihua. ''The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition.'' 2005. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Yao Zhihua writes:&lt;ref name="Yao, Zhihua 2005. p. 11"/&gt;

{{quote|In their view, the Buddha is equipped with the following supernatural qualities: transcendence (''lokottara''), lack of defilements, all of his utterances [[Dharmachakra|preaching his teaching]], expounding all his teachings in a single utterance, all of his sayings being true, his physical body being limitless, his power (''prabhāva'') being limitless, the length of his life being limitless, never tiring of enlightening sentient beings and awakening pure faith in them, having no sleep or dreams, no pause in answering a question, and always in meditation (''[[Samadhi|samādhi]]'').}}

A doctrine ascribed to the Mahāsāṃghikas is, "The power of the tathāgatas is unlimited, and the life of the buddhas is unlimited."&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, Kenneth. ''The Dawn of Chinese Pure Land Buddhist Doctrine.'' 1990. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; According to Guang Xing, two main aspects of the Buddha can be seen in Mahāsāṃghika teachings: the true Buddha who is omniscient and omnipotent, and the manifested forms through which he liberates sentient beings through skillful means.&lt;ref&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; For the Mahāsaṃghikas, the historical Gautama Buddha was one of these transformation bodies (Skt. ''[[trikaya|nirmāṇakāya]]''), while the essential real Buddha is equated with the [[Dharmakāya]].&lt;ref&gt;Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' 2008. pp. 59-60&lt;/ref&gt;

As in Mahāyāna traditions, the Mahāsāṃghikas held the doctrine of the existence of many contemporaneous buddhas throughout the ten directions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated65"&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; In the Mahāsāṃghika ''Lokānuvartana Sūtra'', it is stated, "The Buddha knows all the dharmas of the countless buddhas of the ten directions."&lt;ref name="autogenerated65"/&gt; It is also stated, "All buddhas have one body, the body of the Dharma."&lt;ref name="autogenerated65"/&gt; The concept of many bodhisattvas simultaneously working toward buddhahood is also found among the Mahāsāṃghika tradition, and further evidence of this is given in the ''Samayabhedoparacanacakra'', which describes the doctrines of the Mahāsāṃghikas.&lt;ref&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depictions of the Buddha in art==
{{main|Buddharupa}}
[[File:ShwedagonIMG 7662.JPG|thumb|[[Buddharupa|Buddha statues]] at [[Shwedagon Pagoda]]]]
Buddhas are frequently represented in the form of statues and paintings. Commonly seen designs include:
* The Seated Buddha
* The Reclining Buddha
* The Standing Buddha
*''Hotei'' or ''[[Budai]]'', the obese Laughing Buddha, usually seen in [[China]] (This figure is believed to be a representation of a medieval Chinese monk who is associated with [[Maitreya]], the future Buddha, and is therefore technically not a Buddha image.)
* the Emaciated Buddha, which shows Siddhartha Gautama during his extreme ascetic practice of starvation.

The Buddha statue shown calling for rain is a pose common in [[Lao Buddhist sculpture|Laos]].

===Markings===
Most depictions of Buddha contain a certain number of ''markings'', which are considered the signs of his enlightenment. These signs vary regionally, but two are common:

*a protuberance on the top of the head (denoting superb mental acuity)
*long earlobes (denoting superb perception)

In the Pāli Canon, there is frequent mention of a list of thirty-two [[physical characteristics of the Buddha]].

===Hand-gestures===
The poses and hand-gestures of these statues, known respectively as [[asana]]s and [[mudra]]s, are significant to their overall meaning. The popularity of any particular mudra or asana tends to be region-specific, such as the ''[[Vajra]]'' (or ''Chi Ken-in'') mudra, which is popular in [[Japan]] and [[Korean Buddhist sculpture|Korea]] but rarely seen in [[India]]. Others are more common; for example, the ''Varada'' (Wish Granting) mudra is common among standing statues of the Buddha, particularly when coupled with the ''Abhaya'' (Fearlessness and Protection) mudra.

==Names of the Buddha==
[[Aśvaghoṣa]] in his ''[[Buddhacarita]]'' gives a long list of names for the Buddha:
{{quote|Buddha, Self-existent, Lord of Law (Dharmaraja), Nayaka, Vinayaka, Caravan Leader, Jina (Victorious One), the Master-giver of Dharma, The Teacher, Master of the Dharma, the Lord of the World, the consoler, the loving-regarder [cf. Avalokiteshvara,] the Hero, the champion, the victorious one in conflict, Light of the World, Illuminator of the Knowledge of True Wisdom, The dispeller of the darkness of ignorance, Illuminator of the Great Torch,  Great Physician, Great Seer, the Healer, Attainer of the Great Vehicle (Mahayana), Lord of all Dharma, the Ruler, Monarch of All Worlds, the Sovereign, Lord of all wisdom, the wise, the destroyer of the pride of all disputers, the omniscient, the Arhat, Possessor of Perfect Knowledge, the Great Buddha, Lord of Saints, The Victorious, the Perfect Buddha, Sugata, the wise one who fulfills the wishes of all beings, The ruler of the world, bearer of the world, master of the world, sovereign of the world,  teacher of the world, preceptor of the world, The Fount of Nectar, the powerful luminary, Bringer of all virtue and all real wealth, possessor of perfect excellence and all good qualities, the guide on the road of wisdom who shows the way to Nirvana, Tathagata without stain, without attachment, without uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=E.

In his commentary to the ''[[Śūraṅgama Sūtra]]'', [[Hsuan Hua]] tells the following fable: 
{{quote|Originally every Buddha had ten thousand names. In time these ten thousand names were reduced to one thousand because people got confused trying to remember them all. For a while every Buddha had a thousand names, but people still couldn’t remember so many, so they were again reduced to one hundred names. Every Buddha had a hundred different names and living beings had a hard time remembering them, so they were shortened again to ten.&lt;ref&gt;From the Chapter on "The General Explanation of the Title", ''The Surangama Sutra'', English translation by the Buddhist Text Translation Society.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15343">Starting in the early 1990s, [[James F. Moore]] originated the [[strategic planning]] concept of a '''business ecosystem''', now widely adopted in the [[high tech]] community. The basic definition comes from Moore's book, ''[[The Death of Competition: Leadership and Strategy in the Age of Business Ecosystems]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The origins of the concept==
The concept first appeared in Moore's May/June 1993 ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article, titled "Predators and Prey: A New Ecology of Competition", and won the [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]] Award for article of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:9vCCtUPpvH8J:www.isc.hbs.edu/mckinsey.pdf+james+moore+1993+mckinsey+award&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESi5p3-FjaIXFtwHhFgLk7zc8HukKsFKCUhk17KyhXsWjl2ZBPZOiATTd8LJWia5pJCZRj4xKsTs09f6p0XeZxJZaE3IJFQ5fhcsM9aZEgs6ahQVkQQm_JuL7rsOA_h49yV403Cf&amp;sig=AHIEtbQsPjXx1J8LDyvOVZQBtu41LnVm1w|page=2|title=McKinsey Award Winners for Best ''HBR'' Articles|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore defined "business ecosystem" as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
An economic community supported by a foundation of interacting organizations and individuals—the organisms of the business world. The economic community produces goods and services of value to customers, who are themselves members of the ecosystem. The member organisms also include suppliers, lead producers, competitors, and other stakeholders. Over time, they [[coevolve]] their capabilities and roles, and tend to align themselves with the directions set by one or more central companies. Those companies holding leadership roles may change over time, but the function of ecosystem leader is valued by the community because it enables members to move toward shared visions to align their investments, and to find mutually supportive roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Moore|1996|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moore used several ecological [[metaphor]]s, suggesting that the firm is embedded in a (business) environment, that it needs to coevolve with other companies, and that “the particular [[Ecological niche|niche]] a business occupies is challenged by newly arriving species.”&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Moore|1996|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that companies need to become proactive in developing mutually beneficial ("[[symbiotic]]") relationships with customers, suppliers, and even competitors.

Using ecological metaphors to describe business structure and operations is increasingly common especially within the field of information technology (IT). For example, [[J.

==Industries==
Gruber explains that over a century ago, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motors]] did well using methods of mass production, an assembly line, and [[insourcing]]. However, Ford began to outsource its production “[w]hen the ecology evolved.” Gruber (n.d.) has stated that such evolution in the ecology of the business world is “punctuated now and then by radical changes in the environment” and that “globalization and the Internet are the equivalents of large-scale climate change. Globalization is eliminating the traditional advantages of the large corporation: access to capital, access to markets, and economies of scale”.&lt;ref name=gruber/&gt;

The [[application service provider]] (ASP) industry is moving toward relationship networks and focusing on core competencies. “According to the gospel of [[Cisco Systems]], companies inclined to exist together within an “ecosystem” facilitate the imminence of Internet-based application delivery”.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Kaminsky|2000|loc=para. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Books also use natural systems metaphors without discussing the interfaces between human business and biological ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Baskin|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another work defines business ecology as “a new field for sustainable organizational management and design,” one “that is based on the principle that organizations, as living organisms, are most successful when their development and behavior are aligned with their core purpose and values – what we call “social DNA’”.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Abe|Dempsey|Bassett|1998|pp=xii-xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for companies to attend to ecological health is indicated by the following: “Business ecology is based on the elegant structure and principles of natural systems. It recognizes that to develop healthy business ecosystems, leaders and their organizations must see themselves, and their environments, through an “ecological lens”.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Abe|Dempsey|Bassett|1998|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological ecosystems==
Some environmentalists have used "business ecosystems" as a way to talk about environmental issues as they relate to business rather than as a metaphor to describe the increasing complexity of relationships among companies. According to Townsend, business ecology is the study of the reciprocal relationship between business and organisms and their environments. The goal of this "business ecology" is sustainability through the complete ecological synchronization and integration of a business with the sites that it inhabits, uses, and affects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Townsend|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other environmentalists believe that the ecosystem metaphor is just a way for business to appear 'Green'. According to author [[Alan Marshall (New Zealand author)|Alan Marshall]], the metaphor is used to make out that somehow business operates using natural principles which should be left to run without interference by governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Unity of Nature: Wholeness and Disintegration in Ecology and Science|last = Marshall|first = Alan|publisher = Imperial College Press|year = 2002|isbn = 9781860943300|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Pages needed|date=February 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8781">In [[physics]], the '''center-of-momentum frame''' (also '''zero-momentum frame''' or '''COM frame''') of a system is the unique (up to velocity but not origin) [[inertial frame]] in which the total momentum of the system vanishes. The ''center of momentum'' of a system is not a location (but a collection of relative momenta/velocities). Thus "center of momentum" means "center-of-momentum '''frame'''" and is a short form of this phrase.&lt;ref name="Forshaw and Smith"&gt;Dynamics and Relativity, J.R. Forshaw, A.G. Smith, Wiley, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-470-01460-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special case of the center-of-momentum frame is the '''center-of-mass frame''': an inertial frame in which the [[center of mass]] (which is a physical point) remains at the origin. In all COM frames, the center of mass is at rest, but it is not necessarily at the origin of the coordinate system.

In [[special relativity]], the COM frame is necessarily unique only when the system is isolated.

==Properties==

===General===
The center of momentum frame is defined as the inertial frame in which the sum over the linear momentum of each particle vanishes. Let ''S'' denote the laboratory reference system and ''S''′ denote the center-of-momentum reference frame. Using a [[galilean transformation]], the particle velocity in ''S''′ is

&lt;math&gt; v' = v - V_c ,&lt;/math&gt;

where 
&lt;math&gt;
V_c = \frac{\sum_i m_i v_i}{\sum_i m_i}
&lt;/math&gt;

is the velocity of the mass center.  The total momentum in the center-of-momentum system then vanishes:

&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i} p'_i = \sum_{i} m_i v'_i 
= \sum_{i} m_i (v_i - V_c) 
= \sum_{i} m_i v_i - \sum_i m_i \frac{\sum_j m_j v_j}{\sum_j m_j} 
= \sum_i m_i v_i - \sum_j m_j v_j
= 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

Also, the total [[energy]] of the system is the ''minimal energy'' as seen from all [[inertial reference frame]]s.

===Special relativity===

In [[special relativity|relativity]], COM frame exists for an isolated massive system. This is a consequence of [[Noether's theorem#Example 2: Conservation of center of momentum|Noether's theorem]]. In the COM frame the total energy of the system is the ''[[rest energy]]'', and this quantity (when divided by the factor ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]) gives the [[rest mass]] ([[invariant mass]]) of the system:

:&lt;math&gt; m_0 = \frac{E_0}{c^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[invariant mass]] of the system is given in any inertial frame by the relativistic invariant relation

:&lt;math&gt; m_0{}^2 =\left(\frac{E}{c^2}\right)^2-\left(\frac{p}{c}\right)^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;

but for zero momentum the momentum term (''p''/''c'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; vanishes and thus the total energy coincides with the rest energy.

Systems that have nonzero energy but zero [[rest mass]] (such as [[photons]] moving in a single direction, or equivalently, [[plane wave|plane]] [[electromagnetic wave]]s) do not have COM frames, because there is no frame in which they have zero net momentum. Due to the invariance of the [[speed of light]], such [[Massless particle|massless]] systems must travel at the speed of light in any frame, and therefore always possess a net momentum magnitude that is equal to their energy divided by the speed of light:

:&lt;math&gt; p = \frac{E}{c} .&lt;/math&gt;

==Two-body problem==

An example of the usage of this frame is given below – in a two-body collision, not necessarily elastic (where ''kinetic energy'' is conserved).  The COM frame can be used to find the momentum of the particles much easier than in a [[lab frame]]: the frame where the measurement or calculation is done.  The situation is analyzed using [[Galilean transformations]] and [[conservation of momentum]] (for generality, rather than kinetic energies alone), for two particles of mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, moving at initial velocities (before collision) '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; respectively.  The transformations are applied to take the velocity of the frame from the velocity of each particle from the lab frame (unprimed quantities) to the COM frame (primed quantities):&lt;ref name="Forshaw and Smith"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_1^\prime = \mathbf{u}_1 - \mathbf{V} , \quad \mathbf{u}_2^\prime = \mathbf{u}_2 - \mathbf{V}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''V''' is the velocity of the COM frame. Since '''V''' is the velocity of the COM, i.e. the time derivative of the COM location '''R''' (position of the center of mass of the system):&lt;ref&gt;Classical Mechanics, T.W.B. Kibble, European Physics Series, 1973, {{ISBN|0-07-084018-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\frac{{\rm d}\mathbf{R}}{{\rm d}t} &amp; = \frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}t}\left(\frac{m_1\mathbf{r}_1+m_2\mathbf{r}_2}{m_1+m_2} \right) \\
&amp; = \frac{m_1\mathbf{u}_1 + m_2\mathbf{u}_2 }{m_1+m_2} \\
&amp; = \mathbf{V} \\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

so at the origin of the COM frame, '''R''' = '''0''', this implies

:&lt;math&gt; m_1\mathbf{u}_1^\prime + m_2\mathbf{u}_2^\prime = \boldsymbol{0} &lt;/math&gt;

The same results can be obtained by applying momentum conservation in the lab frame, where the momenta are '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V} = \frac{\mathbf{p}_1 + \mathbf{p}_2}{m_1+m_2} = \frac{m_1\mathbf{u}_1 + m_2\mathbf{u}_2}{m_1+m_2}&lt;/math&gt;

and in the COM frame, where it is asserted definitively that the total momenta of the particles, '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;' and '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;', vanishes:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p}_1^\prime + \mathbf{p}_2^\prime = m_1\mathbf{u}_1^\prime + m_2\mathbf{u}_2^\prime = \boldsymbol{0} &lt;/math&gt;

Using the COM frame equation to solve for '''V''' returns the lab frame equation above, demonstrating any frame (including the COM frame) may be used to calculate the momenta of the particles. It has been established that the velocity of the COM frame can be removed from the calculation using the above frame, so the momenta of the particles in the COM frame can be 
expressed in terms of the quantities in the lab frame (i.e. the given initial values):

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} 
\mathbf{p}_1^\prime &amp; = m_1\mathbf{u}_1^\prime \\
 &amp; = m_1 \left( \mathbf{u}_1 - \mathbf{V} \right) = \frac{m_1m_2}{m_1+m_2} \left( \mathbf{u}_1 - \mathbf{u}_2 \right) \\
 &amp; = -m_2\mathbf{u}_2^\prime = -\mathbf{p}_2^\prime \\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

notice the [[relative velocity]] in the lab frame of particle 1 to 2 is

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{u}_1 - \mathbf{u}_2 &lt;/math&gt;

and the 2-body [[reduced mass]] is

:&lt;math&gt; \mu = \frac{m_1m_2}{m_1+m_2} &lt;/math&gt;

so the momenta of the particles compactly reduce to

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p}_1^\prime = -\mathbf{p}_2^\prime = \mu \Delta\mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;

This is a substantially simpler calculation of the momenta of both particles; the reduced mass and relative velocity can be calculated from the initial velocities in the lab frame and the masses, and the momentum of one particle is simply the negative of the other. The calculation can be repeated for final velocities '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in place of the initial velocities '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, since after the collision the velocities still satisfy the above equations:&lt;ref&gt;''An Introduction to Mechanics'', D. Kleppner, R.J. Kolenkow, Cambridge University Press, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-521-19821-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\frac{{\rm d}\mathbf{R}}{{\rm d}t} &amp; = \frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}t}\left(\frac{m_1\mathbf{r}_1+m_2\mathbf{r}_2}{m_1+m_2} \right) \\
&amp; = \frac{m_1\mathbf{v}_1 + m_2\mathbf{v}_2 }{m_1+m_2} \\
&amp; = \mathbf{V} \\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

so at the origin of the COM frame, '''R''' = '''0''', this implies after the collision

:&lt;math&gt; m_1\mathbf{v}_1^\prime + m_2\mathbf{v}_2^\prime = \boldsymbol{0} &lt;/math&gt;

In the lab frame, the conservation of momentum fully reads:

:&lt;math&gt; m_1\mathbf{u}_1 + m_2\mathbf{u}_2 = m_1\mathbf{v}_1 + m_2\mathbf{v}_2 = (m_1+m_2)\mathbf{V}&lt;/math&gt;

This equation does ''not'' imply that

:&lt;math&gt; m_1\mathbf{u}_1 = m_1\mathbf{v}_1 = m_1\mathbf{V}, \quad m_2\mathbf{u}_2 = m_2\mathbf{v}_2 = m_2\mathbf{V}&lt;/math&gt;

instead, it simply indicates the total mass ''M'' multiplied by the velocity of the centre of mass '''V''' is the total momentum '''P''' of the system:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} \mathbf{P} &amp; = \mathbf{p}_1 + \mathbf{p}_2 \\
&amp; = (m_1 + m_2)\mathbf{V} \\
&amp; = M\mathbf{V}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Similar analysis to the above obtains

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p}_1^\prime = -\mathbf{p}_2^\prime = \mu \Delta\mathbf{v} = \mu \Delta\mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;

where the final [[relative velocity]] in the lab frame of particle 1 to 2 is

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}_1 - \mathbf{v}_2 = \Delta\mathbf{u}.&lt;/math&gt;

{{italic title}}{{Thoreauviana |expanded=Core}}
'''''Resistance to Civil Government''''' ('''''Civil Disobedience''''') is an essay by American [[Transcendentalism|transcendentalist]] [[Henry David Thoreau]] that was first published in 1849. In it, Thoreau argues that individuals should not permit [[government]]s to overrule or atrophy their [[conscience]]s, and that they have a [[duty]] to avoid allowing such [[acquiescence]] to enable the government to make them the agents of [[injustice]]. Thoreau was motivated in part by his disgust with [[slavery]] and the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846–1848).

==Title==
In 1848, Thoreau gave lectures at the Concord [[Lyceum movement|Lyceum]] entitled "The Rights and Duties of the Individual in relation to Government".&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau, H. D. letter to R. W. Emerson, 23 February 1848.&lt;/ref&gt; This formed the basis for his essay, which was first published under the title ''Resistance to Civil Government'' in a 1849 anthology by [[Elizabeth Peabody]] called ''Æsthetic Papers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Thoreau, Esq.|first= H.D.|chapter=Resistance to Civil Government |title=Æsthetic Papers; Edited by Elizabeth P.Peabody |place= Boston and New York |publisher= The Editor and G.P. Putnam |year= 1849 |url=https://archive.org/stream/aestheticpapers00peabrich#page/n197/mode/2up |pages= 189–211|accessdate= February 1, 2018 |via= Internet Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter title distinguished Thoreau's program from that of the "[[nonresistance|non-resistants]]" ([[anarchism|anarcho]]-[[pacifism|pacifists]]) who were expressing similar views. ''Resistance'' also served as part of Thoreau's metaphor comparing the government to a machine: when the machine was producing injustice, it was the duty of conscientious citizens to be "a counter friction" (i.e., a resistance) "to stop the machine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=rtcg#p18|title=“Resistance to Civil Government” by H.D. Thoreau (“Civil Disobedience”)|at=¶18|website=The Picket Line}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, four years after Thoreau's death, the essay was reprinted in a collection of Thoreau's work (''[[A Yankee in Canada, with Anti-Slavery and Reform Papers]]'') under the title ''Civil Disobedience''. Today, the essay also appears under the title ''On the Duty of Civil Disobedience'', perhaps to contrast it with [[William Paley]]'s ''Of the Duty of Civil Obedience'' to which Thoreau was in part responding. For instance, the 1960 [[New American Library]] Signet Classics edition of ''Walden'' included a version with this title. ''On Civil Disobedience'' is another common title.

The word [[Wiktionary:civil|''civil'']] has several definitions. The one that is intended in this case is "relating to citizens and their interrelations with one another or with the state", and so ''civil disobedience'' means "disobedience to the state". Sometimes people assume that ''civil'' in this case means "observing accepted social forms; polite" which would make ''civil disobedience'' something like ''polite, orderly disobedience''. Although this is an acceptable dictionary definition of the word ''civil'', it is not what is intended here. This misinterpretation is one reason the essay is sometimes considered to be an argument for pacifism or for exclusively nonviolent resistance. For instance, [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]] used this interpretation to suggest an equivalence between Thoreau's civil disobedience and his own [[satyagraha]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenwald, Lawrence, ''The Theory, Practice &amp; Influence of Thoreau's Civil Disobedience'', quoting Gandhi, M. K., ''Non-Violent Resistance'', pp. 3–4 and 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[slavery]] crisis inflamed [[New England]] in the 1840s and 1850s. The environment became especially tense after the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]]. A lifelong [[abolitionist]], Thoreau delivered an impassioned speech which would later become ''Civil Disobedience'' in 1848, just months after leaving Walden Pond. The speech dealt with slavery, but at the same time excoriated [[American imperialism]], particularly the [[Mexican–American War]].&lt;ref&gt;Levin, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
Thoreau asserts that because governments are typically more harmful than helpful, they therefore cannot be justified. [[Democracy]] is no cure for this, as majorities simply by virtue of being majorities do not also gain the virtues of [[wisdom]] and [[justice]]. The judgment of an individual's conscience is not necessarily inferior to the decisions of a political body or majority, and so "[i]t is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law, so much as for the right. The only obligation which I have a right to assume is to do at any time what I think right.... Law never made men a whit more just; and, by means of their respect for it, even the well-disposed are daily made the agents of injustice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=rtcg#p04|title="Resistance to Civil Government" by H.D. Thoreau ("Civil Disobedience")|at=¶4|website=The Picket Line|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He adds, "I cannot for an instant recognize as my government [that] which is [[Slavery in the United States|the slave's government]] also."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=rtcg#p07|title="Resistance to Civil Government" by H.D. Thoreau ("Civil Disobedience")|at=¶7|website=The Picket Line|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government, according to Thoreau, is not just a ''little'' corrupt or unjust in the course of doing its otherwise-important work, but in fact the government is ''primarily'' an agent of [[corruption]] and injustice. Because of this, it is "not too soon for honest men to rebel and revolutionize".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=rtcg#p08|title="Resistance to Civil Government" by H.D. Thoreau ("Civil Disobedience")|at=¶8|website=The Picket Line|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political philosophers have counseled caution about revolution because the upheaval of revolution typically causes a lot of expense and suffering. Thoreau contends that such a cost/benefit analysis is inappropriate when the government is actively facilitating an injustice as extreme as slavery. Such a fundamental immorality justifies any difficulty or expense to bring it to an end. "This people must cease to hold slaves, and to make [[Mexican–American War|war on Mexico]], though it cost them their existence as a people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=rtcg#p09|title="Resistance to Civil Government" by H.D. Thoreau ("Civil Disobedience")|at=¶9|website=The Picket Line|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thoreau tells his audience that they cannot blame this problem solely on pro-slavery [[Southern United States|Southern]] politicians, but must put the blame on those in, for instance, [[Massachusetts]], "who are more interested in commerce and agriculture than they are in humanity, and are not prepared to do justice to the slave and to Mexico, ''cost what it may''... There are thousands who are in opinion opposed to slavery and to the war, who yet in effect do nothing to put an end to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=rtcg#p10|title="Resistance to Civil Government" by H.D. Thoreau ("Civil Disobedience")|at=¶10|website=The Picket Line|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also: Thoreau's ''[[Slavery in Massachusetts]]'' which also advances this argument.)

He exhorts people not to just wait passively for an opportunity to ''vote'' for justice, because voting for justice is as ineffective as ''wishing'' for justice; what you need to do is to actually ''be just''. This is not to say that you have an obligation to devote your life to fighting for justice, but you ''do'' have an obligation not to commit injustice and not to give injustice your practical support.

Paying [[tax]]es is one way in which otherwise well-meaning people collaborate in injustice. People who proclaim that the war in Mexico is wrong and that it is wrong to enforce slavery contradict themselves if they fund both things by paying taxes. Thoreau points out that the same people who applaud soldiers for refusing to fight an unjust war are not themselves willing to refuse to fund the government that started the war.

In a constitutional republic like the United States, people often think that the proper response to an unjust law is to try to use the political process to change the law, but to obey and respect the law until it is changed. But if the law is itself clearly unjust, and the lawmaking process is not designed to quickly obliterate such unjust laws, then Thoreau says the law deserves no respect and it should be broken. In the case of the United States, the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] itself enshrines the institution of slavery, and therefore falls under this condemnation. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionists]], in Thoreau's opinion, should completely withdraw their support of the government and [[tax resistance|stop paying taxes]], even if this means courting imprisonment.

{{quote|Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just man is also a prison.... where the State places those who are not ''with'' her, but ''against'' her,—the only house in a slave State in which a free man can abide with honor.... Cast your whole vote, not a strip of paper merely, but your whole influence.  A minority is powerless while it conforms to the majority; it is not even a minority then; but it is irresistible when it clogs by its whole weight.  If the alternative is to keep all just men in prison, or give up war and slavery, the State will not hesitate which to choose.  If a thousand men were not to pay their tax bills this year, that would not be a violent and bloody measure, as it would be to pay them, and enable the State to commit violence and shed innocent blood.  This is, in fact, the definition of a peaceable revolution, if any such is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=rtcg#p22|title=“Resistance to Civil Government” by H.D. Thoreau (“Civil Disobedience”)|at=¶22|website=The Picket Line}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Because the government will retaliate, Thoreau says he prefers living simply because he therefore has less to lose. "I can afford to refuse allegiance to Massachusetts.... It costs me less in every sense to incur the penalty of disobedience to the State than it would to obey. I should feel as if I were worth less in that case."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=rtcg#p24|title="Resistance to Civil Government" by H.D. Thoreau ("Civil Disobedience")|at=¶24|website=The Picket Line|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was briefly imprisoned for refusing to pay the [[Tax per head|poll tax]], but even in jail felt freer than the people outside. He considered it an interesting experience and came out of it with a new perspective on his relationship to the government and its citizens. (He was released the next day when "someone interfered, and paid that tax".)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=rtcg#p33|title="Resistance to Civil Government" by H.D. Thoreau ("Civil Disobedience")|at=¶33|website=The Picket Line|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thoreau said he was willing to pay the highway tax, which went to pay for something of benefit to his neighbors, but that he was opposed to taxes that went to support the government itself—even if he could not tell if his particular contribution would eventually be spent on an unjust project or a beneficial one. "I simply wish to refuse allegiance to the State, to withdraw and stand aloof from it effectually."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=rtcg#p36|title=“Resistance to Civil Government” by H.D. Thoreau (“Civil Disobedience”)|at=¶36|website=The Picket Line}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because government is man-made, not an element of nature or an [[act of God]], Thoreau hoped that its makers could be reasoned with. As governments go, he felt, the U.S. government, with all its faults, was not the worst and even had some admirable qualities. But he felt we could and should insist on better. "The progress from an absolute to a limited monarchy, from a limited monarchy to a democracy, is a progress toward a true respect for the individual.... Is a democracy, such as we know it, the last improvement possible in government?  Is it not possible to take a step further towards recognizing and organizing the rights of man? There will never be a really free and enlightened State until the State comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power, from which all its own power and authority are derived, and treats him accordingly."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=rtcg#p46|title="Resistance to Civil Government" by H.D.

{{Quote|I heartily accept the motto,—"That government is best which governs least;" and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which I also believe,—"That government is best which governs not at all;" and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have.

== Influence ==

===Mohandas Gandhi===
[[India]]n independence leader [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mohandas Gandhi]] (a.k.a. Mahatma Gandhi) was impressed by Thoreau's arguments. In 1907, about one year into his first ''[[satyagraha]]'' campaign in [[South Africa]], he wrote a translated synopsis of Thoreau's argument for ''[[Indian Opinion]]'', credited Thoreau's essay with being "the chief cause of the abolition of slavery in America", and wrote that "Both his example and writings are at present exactly applicable to the Indians in the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]]."&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M. K. "Duty of Disobeying Laws", ''Indian Opinion'', 7 September and 14 September 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; He later concluded:
{{quote|Thoreau was a great writer, philosopher, poet, and withal a most practical man, that is, he taught nothing he was not prepared to practice in himself. He was one of the greatest and most moral men America has produced. At the time of the abolition of slavery movement, he wrote his famous essay ''On the Duty of Civil Disobedience''. He went to [[Prison|gaol]]&lt;!--THIS IS THE CORRECT SPELLING FROM THE ORIGINAL; IT /IS/ A SPELLING OF "JAIL"--&gt; for the sake of his principles and suffering humanity. His essay has, therefore, been sanctified by suffering. Moreover, it is written for all time. Its incisive logic is unanswerable.|"For Passive Resisters" (1907).&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M. K. "For Passive Resisters", ''[[Indian Opinion]]'', 26 October 1907.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Martin Luther King, Jr.===
American civil rights leader Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] was also influenced by this essay. In his autobiography, he wrote:
{{quote|
During my student days I read Henry David Thoreau's essay ''On Civil Disobedience'' for the first time. Here, in this courageous New Englander's refusal to pay his taxes and his choice of jail rather than support a war that would spread slavery's territory into Mexico, I made my first contact with the theory of nonviolent resistance. Fascinated by the idea of refusing to cooperate with an evil system, I was so deeply moved that I reread the work several times.

I became convinced that noncooperation with [[evil]] is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good. No other person has been more eloquent and passionate in getting this idea across than Henry David Thoreau. As a result of his writings and personal witness, we are the heirs of a legacy of creative protest. The teachings of Thoreau came alive in our civil rights movement; indeed, they are more alive than ever before. Whether expressed in a [[sit-in]] at lunch counters, a [[Freedom rides|freedom ride]] into Mississippi, a peaceful protest in Albany, Georgia, a [[Montgomery bus boycott|bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama]], these are outgrowths of Thoreau's insistence that evil must be resisted and that no moral man can patiently adjust to injustice.|''The Autobiography of Martin Luther King, Jr.''&lt;ref&gt;King, M. L. "Morehouse College" (Chapter 2 of ''The Autobiography of Martin Luther King, Jr.'')&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Martin Buber===
Existentialist [[Martin Buber]] wrote, of ''Civil Disobedience''

{{quote|I read it with the strong feeling that here was something that concerned me directly.... It was the concrete, the personal element, the "here and now" of this work that won me over. Thoreau did not put forth a general proposition as such; he described and established his attitude in a specific historical-biographic situation. He addressed his reader within the very sphere of this situation common to both of them in such a way that the reader not only discovered why Thoreau acted as he did at that time but also that the reader—assuming him of course to be honest and dispassionate– would have to act in just such a way whenever the proper occasion arose, provided he was seriously engaged in fulfilling his existence as a human person.

The question here is not just about one of the numerous individual cases in the struggle between a truth powerless to act and a power that has become the enemy of truth. It is really a question of the absolutely concrete demonstration of the point at which this struggle at any moment becomes man's duty ''as man''....|"Man's Duty as Man" (1962)&lt;ref&gt;Buber, Martin, ''Man's Duty as Man'' from ''Thoreau in Our Season'' [[University of Massachusetts Press]] (1962) p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Others===
Author [[Leo Tolstoy]] cited ''Civil Disobedience'' as having a strong impact on his nonviolence methodology. Others who are said to have been influenced by ''Civil Disobedience'' include: President [[John F. Kennedy]], Supreme Court Justice [[William O. Douglas]], and various writers such as, [[Marcel Proust]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Upton Sinclair]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], and [[William Butler Yeats]].&lt;ref&gt;Maynard, W. Barksdale, ''Walden Pond: A History''. Oxford University Press, 2005 (p. 265).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2008}}
A '''constitutional convention''' is an informal and uncodified procedural agreement that is followed by the institutions of a state. In some states, notably those [[Commonwealth of Nations]] states that follow the [[Westminster system]] and whose political systems derive from [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitutional law]], most government functions are guided by constitutional convention rather than by a formal written constitution.
In these states, actual distribution of power may be markedly different from those the formal constitutional documents describe. In particular, the formal constitution often confers wide discretionary powers on the [[head of state]] that, in practice, are used only on the advice of the [[head of government]].

Some constitutional conventions operate separate from or alongside written constitutions, such as in Canada since the country was formed with the enactment of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]]. Others, notably the United Kingdom which lack a single overarching constitutional document, unwritten conventions are still of vital importance in understanding how the state functions. In most states, however, many old conventions have been replaced or superseded by laws (called codification).

The term was first used by British legal scholar [[A. V. Dicey]] in his 1883 book, ''Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution''. Dicey wrote that in Britain, the actions of political actors and institutions are governed by two parallel and complementary sets of rules:

{{cquote|The one set of rules are in the strictest sense "laws", since they are rules which (whether written or unwritten, whether enacted by statute or derived from the mass of custom, tradition, or judge-made maxims {{sic|?|know}} as the common law) are enforced by the courts....

The other set of rules consist of conventions, understandings, habits, or practices that&amp;mdash;though they may regulate the conduct of the several members of the sovereign power, the Ministry, or other officials&amp;mdash;are not really laws, since they are not enforced by the courts. This portion of constitutional law may, for the sake of distinction, be termed the "conventions of the constitution", or constitutional morality.&lt;ref&gt;AV Dicey, ''Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution'', 10th edition, pp. 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A century later, Canadian scholar [[Peter Hogg]] wrote,

{{cquote|Conventions are rules of the constitution which are not enforced by the law courts. Because they are not enforced by the law courts they are best regarded as non-legal rules, but because they do in fact regulate the working of the constitution they are an important concern of the constitutional lawyer. What conventions do is to prescribe the way in which legal powers shall be exercised. Some conventions have the effect of transferring effective power from the legal holder to another official or institution. Other conventions limit an apparently broad power, or even prescribe that a legal power shall not be exercised at all.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Origins==

Constitutional conventions arise when the exercise of a certain type of power, which is not prohibited by law, arouses such opposition that it becomes impossible, on future occasions, to engage in further exercises of this power. For example, the constitutional convention that the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] cannot remain in office without the support of a majority of votes the House of Commons is derived from an unsuccessful attempt by the ministry of [[Robert Peel]] to govern without the support of a majority in the House, in [[First Peel ministry|1834&amp;ndash;1835]].

==Enforceability in the courts==

Constitutional conventions are not, and cannot be, enforced by courts of law. The primary reason for this, according to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in its 1981 [[Patriation Reference]], is that, "They are generally in conflict with the legal rules which they postulate and the courts may be bound to enforce the legal rules."&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court of Canada, ''Attorney General of Manitoba et al. v. Attorney General of Canada et al.'' (September 28, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, the conventions make certain acts, which would be permissible under a straightforward reading of the law, impermissible in practice. The court ruled that this conflict between convention and law means that no convention, no matter how well-established or universally accepted, can "crystallize" into law, unless the relevant parliament or legislature enacts a law or constitutional amendment codifying for a convention at which must specify request and consensus' for enactment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1982/4.html&lt;/ref&gt; This principle is regarded as authoritative in a number of other jurisdictions, including the UK.

Some conventions evolve or change over time. For example, before 1918 the British [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] requested a parliamentary dissolution from the monarch, with the Prime Minister conveying the request. Since 1918, Prime Ministers request dissolutions on their own initiative, and need not consult members of the Cabinet (although, at the very least, it would be unusual for the Cabinet not to be aware of the Prime Minister's intention).

However, conventions are rarely ever broken. Unless there is general agreement on the breach, the person who breaches a convention is often heavily criticised, on occasions leading to a loss of respect or popular support. It is often said {{By whom|date=May 2016}} that "conventions are not worth the paper they are written on", i.e., they are unenforceable in law because they are not written down.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Examples==

===Australia===
* Whoever can command a majority in the House of Representatives is entitled to be asked by the Governor-General to form a government, and take the title Prime Minister.
* Governors-General always act on the advice of their Prime Minister or other relevant minister in regard to particular powers they may exercise.
* An incumbent Prime Minister who loses an election will advise the Governor-General to appoint the leader of the larger party as Prime Minister so the Governor-General does not need to act alone.
* State Premiers tender advice to State Governors for Federal Senate elections, in response to the Prime Minister's advice to the Governor-General to call a Federal House of Representatives election.
* State Governors are given a [[dormant commission]] to administer the Commonwealth if the Governor-General is unable to.
* Vice-regal officers act in a politically neutral way.

No convention is absolute; all but one (the second) of the above conventions were disregarded in the leadup to or during the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis of 1975]].

Ignoring constitutional conventions does not always result in a crisis. After the [[Tasmanian state election, 2010]], the Governor of Tasmania rejected the advice of his Premier to appoint the leader of the opposition as Premier because he felt the advice was tendered in bad faith. The Premier went on to form a new government.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
* The six members of the [[Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], that are chosen by the Parliaments of entities of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], should be chosen in a way as to establish the national balance, of "constituent peoples", in the Court (two [[Bosniaks]], two [[Croats|Croatian]]s and two [[Serb]]s), although the [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Constitution]] does not have this requirement.
* The Chairman of the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] should be of different nationality in every new term (establishing the "rotation"), although this is not formally regulated.
* The government of an [[Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina|entity]] should inform the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina|government of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] of its intention to establish special parallel relationships with neighboring states, including negotiations. Also, the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|High Representative]] should be notified of any such intent, especially if there is a document that should be signed between parties, although the [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Constitution]] does not have this requirement (also for first example).

===Canada===
* Previously the Senate would not defeat a bill passed by the House of Commons, it was broken in 1989 when the Senate defeated a bill regulating abortions. It was broken again for a bill that would have ratified a [[free trade agreement]] between Canada and the United States.
* The Prime Minister will request the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] to call an election upon the defeat of the government in a confidence or money vote. This convention was broken in 1968 when the ruling [[minority government]] unexpectedly lost a money vote. All the parties in Parliament, who were not prepared for a snap election, agreed to pass a resolution retroactively declaring the lost money vote was not a matter of confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McGregor |first=Janyce |title=Feeling confident about the budget vote? |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/inside-politics-blog/2012/06/feeling-confident-about-the-budget-vote.html |work=[[CBC News]] |accessdate=12 May 2013 |date=11 June 2012 |quote=In 1968, Lester Pearson was prime minister, presiding over a minority Liberal government. Pearson governed largely with the support of the NDP, but in February the Liberals unexpectedly lost a final Commons vote over an amendment to the Income Tax Act. A strict reading of parliamentary convention would have suggested that vote was enough to trigger an election, because the change constituted a "money bill." But the Liberals were in the process of selecting a new leader, and Pearson gambled that no one really wanted an election right away. Pearson went on television and told Canadians that his government would put a second vote before the House of Commons specifically asking whether or not his government continued to command the confidence of the House of Commons, rather than the merits or demerits of a tax change. His gamble worked: his party won the second, more specific vote and carried on governing. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417044908/http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/inside-politics-blog/2012/06/feeling-confident-about-the-budget-vote.html |archivedate=April 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Though it is mentioned in various constitutional documents, the precise nature of the office of the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] operates mostly according to understood, uncodified British conventions.
* The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] is, by statute (the ''[[Supreme Court Act]]''), composed of three justices from [[Quebec]] and six from anywhere in Canada (including Quebec).  This is because Quebec uses [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] rather than the common law system used elsewhere in Canada; it is necessary to have a panel of at least three judges to hear civil law cases.  By convention, the remaining six positions are divided in the following manner: three from Ontario; two from the western provinces, typically one from British Columbia and one from the prairie provinces, which rotate amongst themselves (although Alberta is known to cause skips in the rotation); and one from the Atlantic provinces, almost always from Nova Scotia or New Brunswick.  The appointment of the most senior puisne justice to chief justice is a convention that has recently fallen into disuse. There is also an attempt to appoint at least one justice straight from legal practice without having previously been a judge.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Commonwealth Realms===
* The [[Governor-General]] is appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister of the day, is a resident of the country he or she will represent, and can be dismissed immediately on the advice of the Prime Minister (exceptions are [[Papua New Guinea]] and the [[Solomon Islands]], where the Governor-General is elected by Parliament and then formally appointed by the Queen, and the United Kingdom, which has no vice-regal office). However, in Canada, provincial lieutenant-governors are appointed on the advice of the federal prime minister, not the provincial premier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Victoria| author-link=Victoria of the United Kingdom| publication-date=29 March 1867| title=Constitution Act, 1867| series=V.58| publication-place=Westminster| publisher=Queen's Printer| url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/ca_1867.html| accessdate=15 January 2009| ref=CITEREF_Victoria_1867}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Neither the Monarch nor a Governor-General will participate in the political process unless there is an extreme circumstance that merits the use of [[reserve powers]], or when the advice tendered is contrary to established convention.
* Neither the Monarch nor a Governor-General will make [[Partisan (political)|partisan speech]]es or state partisan opinions. This convention was broken in 1975 by [[Colin Hannah|Sir Colin Hannah]], the [[Governor of Queensland]], who called for the defeat of the [[Whitlam Government]]. The Queen, on Whitlam's advice, revoked Hannah's [[dormant commission]] to act as [[Administrator of the Government|Administrator of the Commonwealth of Australia]] and the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] later refused the [[Premier of Queensland]]'s request that they advise the Queen to appoint Hannah to a second term as Governor (in 1975, Australian State Governors were still appointed on the advice of UK ministers)

===Denmark===
* The [[Danish Constitution]] makes reference to the King in great detail. Apart from the fact that this is understood to include a [[Queen regnant]] as well, references to the King acting in a political capacity are understood to mean the Prime Minister, as the Constitution stipulates that the King exercises his powers through the Cabinet.
* According to the Constitution, any public expenditure must be provided for in the annual [[money bill]] or provisional money bills. However, although not provided for in the Constitution, according to constitutional custom, the Parliamentary Budgetary Committee has the power to authorise provisional expenditure, regardless of the fact that such expenditure is not formally included in the budget (such grants are however then marked for adoption in the next forthcoming money bill).

===France===
* If the [[President of France|President]] of the Republic and the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] are [[Cohabitation (government)|not from the same party]], foreign affairs and defense are conducted by the President.
* If the president of the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]], the president of the [[French Senate|Senate]] or 60 deputies or 60 senators claim that a just-voted [[statute]] is unconstitutional, the President of the Republic does not sign the law and instead waits for a petition to be sent to the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]].

===Lebanon===
* The Lebanese constitution states that the [[President of Lebanon]] is elected by a simple majority of the [[Parliament of Lebanon]].  However, due to the country's delicate ethnic balance, the Parliament's various factions usually try to agree on a consensus candidate.
* Under the unwritten [[National Pact]], the president must always be a [[Maronite Christian]]; the [[Prime Minister of Lebanon|prime minister]] a [[Sunni Muslim]]; the speaker of Parliament a [[Shia Muslim]]; and the deputy speaker [[Greek Orthodox]].

===Malaysia===
* At the federal level, the [[King of Malaysia|King]] acts on the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]]'s advice, except on certain cases. At the state level, the respective ruler or governor acts on his Chief Minister's advice.
* At the federal level, the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] is the leader of the party with an absolute majority of seats in the [[Dewan Rakyat]] (House of Representatives) and therefore most likely to command the support of the [[Dewan Rakyat]]; and likewise a Chief Minister, the leader of the party with an absolute majority of seats in a State Legislature and therefore most likely to command the support of such State Legislature. 
* The [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] should be a member of the [[Dewan Rakyat]].
* The [[Speaker of the Dewan Rakyat]] chairs the Joint Session of [[Parliament of Malaysia|Parliament]], where the King addresses both [[Dewan Negara]] (Senate) and [[Dewan Rakyat]].

===New Zealand===
There is a convention that the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] of New Zealand should not ask for an early election unless he or she is unable to maintain [[confidence and supply]].{{clarify|date=August 2011}} By the 1950s, it had also become a convention that elections should be held on the last Saturday of November, or the closest date to this range as possible. There are several times when these conventions have been broken and an election has been held several months earlier:
*[[New Zealand general election, 1951|1951 general election]]: [[Sidney Holland]] called the election to get a mandate to face down a [[1951 New Zealand waterfront dispute|dockworks dispute]]. The government was returned to power with an increased majority; by this time the dispute had been resolved.
*[[New Zealand general election, 1984|1984 general election]]: [[Robert Muldoon]]'s government held a narrow four-seat majority in Parliament. Muldoon hoped to strengthen his leadership, as two backbenchers ([[Marilyn Waring]] and [[Mike Minogue]]) were threatening to rebel against the government in an opposition-sponsored anti-nuclear bill. However, Waring and Minogue had not threatened to block confidence and supply. The election was a decisive defeat for the government.
*[[New Zealand general election, 2002|2002 general election]]: [[Helen Clark]] called the election after the collapse of the [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|Alliance]], her coalition partners. Some critics argued that the government could still maintain confidence and supply and therefore the early election was not necessary. The Labour Party remained in power with two different coalition partners.

===Norway===
Because of the 1814 written constitution's pivotal role in providing independence and establishing democracy in the 19th century, the Norwegian parliament has been very reluctant to change it. Few of the developments in the political system that have been taking place since then have been codified as amendments. This reluctance has been labelled constitutional conservatism. The two most important examples of constitutional conventions in the [[Politics of Norway|Norwegian political system]] are parliamentarism and the declining power of the King.
* Parliamentarism has evolved since 1884 and entails that the cabinet must maintain the support of parliament (an absence of mistrust) but it need not have its express support.
* All new laws are passed and all new cabinets are therefore formed in a de jure fashion by the King, although not necessarily in a de facto sense.
* According to the written constitution, the cabinet (council of ministers) are appointed by the King. The appointment of new cabinets by the King is a formality, and the king has not directly exercised executive powers since 1905.

===Spain===
Much of Spain's political framework is codified in the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]], which formalizes the relationship between an independent constitutional [[Monarchy of Spain|monarchy]], the government, and the legislature. However, the constitution invests the monarch as the "arbitrator and moderator of the institutions" of government.

* The King nominates a candidate to stand for the [[Spanish Prime Minister|Presidency of the Government of Spain]], sometimes known in English as 'prime minister'. The nominee then stands before the Congress of Deputies and presents his political agenda for the upcoming legislative term, followed by a [[Indirect election|vote of confidence]] in the nominee and his agenda. The 1978 constitution allows the King to nominate anyone he sees fit to stand for the vote of confidence so long as the King has met with the political party leaders represented in the Congress beforehand. However, King Juan Carlos I has consistently nominated the political party leader who commands a plurality of seats in the Congress of Deputies.
* The Spanish public perception that the monarchy be politically non-partisan in its adherence to constitutional protocol and convention, yet while protecting the public expression of personal political views by members of the royal family. Expressions of personal political views expressed in public include when the Prince of Asturias and his sisters protested against terrorism following the 2004 Madrid bombings, or when the Queen gave controversial political viewpoints during an informal interview.
* Constitutionally, the King appoints the twenty members to the General Council of the Judicial Power of Spain. However, when a vacancy is observed the King's appointment has been customarily on the advice of the government of the day. Additionally, the King appoints the President of the Supreme Court on the advice of the General Council of the Judicial Power of Spain.
* According to the 1978 constitution, grandee and nobility titles, and civil and military decorations, are awarded by the King as head of state. However, in most cases since 1978, the King's appointment of nobility titles have been countersigned by the President of the Government of Spain, with civil awards having been nominated by the President and military awards having been nominated by the military.

=== Switzerland ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Politics of Switzerland]] --&gt;
The following constitutional conventions are part of the political culture of [[Switzerland]]. They hold true at the federal level and mostly so at the cantonal and communal level. Mostly, they aim to reconcile the democratic principle of [[majority rule]] with the need to achieve consensus in a nation that is much more heterogeneous in many respects than other nation-states.
* The government is a body of equals composed in [[Concordance system|political proportion]] to the weight of the various factions in [[Parliament]]; this creates a permanent [[grand coalition]].
* Members of a collective body, including the [[Swiss Federal Council|federal government]], observe [[collegiality]] at all times, that is, they do not publicly criticise one another. They also publicly support all decisions of the collective, even against their own opinion or that of their political party. In the eye of many observers, this convention has become rather strained at the federal level, at least after the 2003 elections to the [[Swiss Federal Council]].
* The [[President|presidency]] of a collective body, particularly a government, rotates yearly; the president is a [[primus inter pares]].

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Constitutional conventions of the United Kingdom}}
While the United Kingdom does not have a written constitution that is a single document, the collection of [[legal instrument]]s that have developed into a body of law known as constitutional law has existed for hundreds of years.

As part of this uncodified British [[constitution]], constitutional conventions play a key role. They are rules that are observed by the various constituted parts though they are not written in any document having legal authority; there are often underlying enforcing principles that are themselves not formal and codified. Nonetheless it is very unlikely that there would be a departure of such conventions without good reason, even if an underlying enforcing principle has been overtaken by history, as these conventions also acquire the force of custom. Examples include:

* The texts of most international treaties are laid before Parliament at least twenty one days before ratification (the '[[Ponsonby Rule]]' of 1924).
* The monarch will accept and act on the advice of their ministers, who are responsible to Parliament for that advice; the monarch does not ignore that advice, except when exercising [[Reserve powers]].
* The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] is the leader of the [[political party|party]] (or coalition of parties) with an absolute majority of seats in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and therefore most likely to command the support of the House of Commons.
* All [[money bills]] must originate in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].
* The monarch grants the [[Royal Assent]] to all legislation – sometimes characterised as all legislation passed in good faith. It is possible that ministers could advise against giving consent, as happens with the [[Crown dependencies]] (convention since the early 18th century – previously monarchs did refuse or withhold the Royal Assent).
* The Prime Minister should be a member of either House of Parliament (between the 18th century - 1963).
** In 1963 it was amended to the effect that no Prime Minister should come from the House of Lords. When the last Prime Minister peer, the Earl of Home, took office he renounced his peerage, and as Sir [[Alec Douglas-Home]] became an MP.
** The Prime Minister can hold office temporarily whilst not a Member of Parliament, for example during a general election or in the case of Douglas-Home, between resigning from the Lords and being elected to the Commons in a by-election.
* All Cabinet members must be members of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], since the cabinet is a committee of the council. Further, certain senior Loyal Opposition shadow cabinet members are also made Privy Counsellors, so that sensitive information may be shared with them "on Privy Council terms".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-3708.pdf Parliamentary briefing – the Privy Council], accessed 20 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* The House of Lords should not reject a budget passed by the House of Commons. This was broken controversially in 1909 by the House of Lords, which argued that the Convention was linked to another Convention that the Commons would not introduce a Bill that 'attacked' peers and their wealth. The Lords claimed that the Commons broke this Convention in [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[David Lloyd George]]'s budget, justifying the Lords' rejection of the budget. The Commons disputed the existence of a linked convention. As a consequence, the Lords' powers over budgets were greatly lessened by the [[Parliament Act 1911]].
* During a [[Uk general election|General Election]], no major party shall put up an opponent against a [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker seeking re-election]]. This convention was not respected during the 1987 General Election, when both the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] fielded candidates against the Conservative Speaker, [[Bernard Weatherill]], who was MP for [[Croydon North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon North East]]. The [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) does stand against the Speaker if he or she represents a [[Scottish Westminster constituencies|Scottish constituency]], as was the case with [[Michael Martin, Baron Martin of Springburn|Michael Martin]], Speaker from 2000 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2005/flash_map/html/map05.stm BBC NEWS | Election 2005 | Election Map&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Westminster Parliament]] will only legislate on [[reserved matters]]. It will not legislate on non-reserved matters ('[[devolved]] matters') without first seeking the consent of the [[Scottish Parliament]] (since 1999, the [[Sewel motion|Sewel convention]], later renamed to [[Legislative Consent Motion]]s).
* The House of Lords shall not oppose legislation from the House of Commons that was a part of the government's [[manifesto]] (the [[Salisbury Convention]]).

=== United States ===
*The [[President of the United States]] will give his [[State of the Union address]] annually and in person, before a joint session of Congress. This practice was followed by George Washington and John Adams but abandoned by Thomas Jefferson and not resumed until 1913, when Woodrow Wilson delivered his State of the Union address in person.  The constitution requires the President give an update on the state of the union "from time to time", but no specifics are outlined. Speeches have been broadcast on radio since 1923 and 1947; the last State of the Union message delivered only in writing was in 1981.*
*Much of how the [[United States Cabinet]] operates is dictated by convention; its operations are only vaguely alluded to in the US constitution.
*While members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] are only required to live in the state they represent, it has generally been expected that they live in the district they represent as well, though there are some exceptions; [[Allen West (politician)|Allen West]] was elected in 2010 representing a district adjacent to the one he resided in.
*The [[President of the United States]] will obtain the [[Senatorial courtesy|consent of both Senators from a state]] before appointing a [[United States Attorney]], [[United States district court|federal district judge]], or [[federal marshal]] with jurisdiction in that state.
*Cabinet officials and other major executive officers resign and are replaced when a new President takes office, unless explicitly asked to stay on by the new President.
*The [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] is always the Representative who leads the ruling party, even though the Constitution does not specify that the Speaker must be a member of the chamber.  Also by custom the Speaker does not vote (except to break a tie).
*The [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate]] will be the most senior Senator of the ruling party.
*Members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] are pledged to vote for a particular Presidential candidate, and are chosen by popular vote with the name of the candidate, and not necessarily the elector, on the ballot.
*Senate rules require a majority of 60 votes to invoke [[cloture]], that is, to break off debate on a bill and force a vote. The Senate could revise its rules at any time, but it doesn't, leaving the [[filibuster]] available as a tool for a large-enough minority to indefinitely block any measure it finds objectionable enough.

'''Contingency management''' ('''CM''') is most-widely used in the field of [[substance abuse]], often implemented as part of [[clinical behavior analysis]]. CM refers to the application of the [[three-term contingency]] (or [[operant conditioning]]), which uses [[stimulus control]] and [[positive reinforcement]] to change behavior. Patients' behaviors are rewarded (or, less often, punished); generally, adherence to or failure to adhere to program rules and regulations or their treatment plan. CM derives from the science of [[applied behavior analysis]] (ABA), and by most evaluations, its procedures produces one of the largest effect sizes out of all mental health and educational interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Forness, S.R., Kavale, K.A., Blum, I.M., &amp; Llyod, J.W. (1997). Mage-analysis of meta-analysis: What works in special education and related services? [[Teaching Exceptional Children]], 29, 4–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voucher programs and related applications in addiction treatment===
Another form of contingency management is voucher programs. In voucher-based contingency management patients earn vouchers exchangeable for retail items contingent upon objectively verified abstinence from recent drug use or compliance with other behavior-change targets. This particular form of contingency management was introduced in the early 1990s as a treatment for cocaine dependence.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, ST, et al., (1991) A behavioral approach to achieving initial cocaine abstinence, ''Am J of Psychiatry'', 148, 1218–1224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, ST, et al. (1993). Achieving cocaine abstinence with a behavioral approach. ''Am J of Psychiatry'', 150, 763–769&lt;/ref&gt; The approach is the most reliably effective method for producing cocaine abstinence in controlled clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;Lussier, JP, et al. (2006). A meta-analysis of voucher-based reinforcement therapy for substance use disorders. ''Addiction'', 101, 192–203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prendergast ML, Hall EA, Roll J, Warda U. (2007). Use of vouchers to reinforce abstinence and positive behaviors among clients in a drug court treatment program. ''J. Subst Abuse Treat''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medication take-home privileges is another form of contingency management frequently used in [[methadone maintenance]] treatment. Patients are permitted to "earn" take-home doses of their methadone in exchange for increasing, decreasing, or ceasing certain behaviors. For example, a patient may be given one take-home dose per week after submitting negative drug screens (generally via urine testing) for three months.  (It is worth noting that take home-doses (or "bottles") are seen as desirable rewards because they allow patients to come to the clinic less often to obtain their medication).

Based in [[applied behavior analysis]] (ABA), contingency management includes techniques such as choice, [[Shaping (psychology)|shaping]], [[Child time-out|time-out]], making contracts between the therapist and patient, and [[token economy]].

Contingent vouchers are also used to cease smoking addictions. One study claims that addicts with substance use disorders can receive help with their addiction through the use of voucher-based treatment for smoking. In addition, nicotine replacement (NRT) can help with addiction combined with the vouchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rohsenow|first=Damaris J.|last2=Martin|first2=Rosemarie A.|last3=Tidey|first3=Jennifer W.|last4=Colby|first4=Suzanne M.|last5=Monti|first5=Peter M.|title=Treating Smokers in Substance Treatment With Contingent Vouchers, Nicotine Replacement and Brief Advice Adapted for Sobriety Settings|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2016.08.012|journal=Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment|doi=10.1016/j.jsat.2016.08.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Level systems==
Level systems are often employed as a form of contingency management system. Level systems are designed such that once one level is achieved, then the person earns all the privileges for that level and the levels lower than it.&lt;ref&gt;Cancio, E. &amp; Johnson, J.W. (2007). Level Systems Revisited: An Impact Tool For Educating Students with Emotional and Behavioral Disorders. ''International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy'', 3 (4), 512–527. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness in addiction programs==
A [[meta-analysis]] of contingency management in drug programs showed that it has a large effect.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher JE, Milby JB, Wallace D, Meehan DC, Kertesz S, Vuchinich R, Dunning J, Usdan S. (2007). Meta-analysis of day treatment and contingency-management dismantling research: Birmingham Homeless Cocaine Studies (1990–2006).

(2007). Clinic variation in the cost-effectiveness of contingency management. ''Am J Addict.'', 16 (6), 457–60&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to these findings in a recent study, the researchers found out that Nicotine replacement treatment only improved the effects of contingent vouchers on short-term smoking abstinence. However, in the long term the effects of contingent vouchers had no impact on tobacco resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rohsenow|first=Damaris J.|last2=Martin|first2=Rosemarie A.|last3=Tidey|first3=Jennifer W.|last4=Colby|first4=Suzanne M.|last5=Monti|first5=Peter M.|title=Treating Smokers in Substance Treatment With Contingent Vouchers, Nicotine Replacement and Brief Advice Adapted for Sobriety Settings|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2016.08.012|journal=Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment|doi=10.1016/j.jsat.2016.08.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Original research|date=October 2012}}

In [[social science]] generally and [[linguistics]] specifically, the '''cooperative principle''' describes how effective communication in [[conversation]] is achieved in common social situations, that is, how listeners and speakers must act cooperatively and mutually accept one another to be understood in a particular way. As phrased by [[Paul Grice]], who introduced it, "Make your contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged."&lt;ref name="grice"&gt;{{cite book|last= Grice|first= Paul|year=1975|chapter=Logic and conversation |title=Syntax and semantics|volume=3: Speech acts |pages=41–58 |editor1-last=Cole|editor1-first=P.|editor2-last=Morgan |editor2-first=J. |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though phrased as a [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptive]] command, the principle is intended as a [[Linguistic description|description]] of how people normally behave in conversation. Jeffries and McIntyre describe Grice's maxims as "encapsulating the assumptions that we prototypically hold when we engage in conversation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeffries|first1=Lesley|last2=McIntyre|first2=Daniel|title=Stylistics|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cooperative principle can be divided into four maxims, called the Gricean maxims, describing specific rational principles observed by people who obey the cooperative principle; these principles enable effective communication.&lt;ref name=Kordic&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kordić, Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |title=Konverzacijske implikature |trans-title=Conversational implicatures |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/446883.KONVERZACIJSKE_IMPLIKATURE.PDF |language=Serbo-Croatian |journal=Suvremena lingvistika |volume=17 |issue=31-32 |page=89 |year=1991 |issn=0586-0296 |oclc=440780341 |id={{ZDB|429609-6}} |archivedate=2 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ANNqArFh?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/446883.KONVERZACIJSKE_IMPLIKATURE.PDF |accessdate=9 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grice proposed four conversational maxims that arise from the [[pragmatics]] of natural [[language]].&lt;ref name=Kordic/&gt; Applying the Gricean maxims is a way to explain the link between utterances and what is understood from them.

==Obeying the cooperative principle==
{{cns|text=Those who obey the cooperative principle in their language use will make sure that what they say in a conversation furthers the purpose of that conversation.|date=January 2018}}

{{cns|text=The cooperative principle goes both ways: speakers observe the cooperative principle, and listeners assume that speakers are observing it. This allows for the possibility of ''[[implicature]]s'', which are meanings that are not explicitly conveyed in what is said, but that can nonetheless be inferred.|date=January 2018}}

==Grice's maxims==

===Maxim of quality===
====Supermaxim:====
* ''Try to make your contribution one that is true.''

==== Submaxims: ====
# Do not say what you believe to be false.
# Do not say that for which you lack adequate [[evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;For arguments that Grice's maxim is best understood in terms of knowledge, see {{cite journal |last1=Benton |first1=Matthew A. |title=Gricean Quality |journal=Nous |date=2016 |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=689-703 |doi=10.1111/nous.12065 |url=https://doi.org/10.1111/nous.12065 |accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maxim of quantity===
# Make your contribution as informative as is required (for the current purposes of the exchange).
# Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.

===Maxim of relation===
* ''Be relevant.''
With respect to this maxim, Grice writes, "Though the maxim itself is terse, its formulation conceals a number of problems that exercise me a good deal: questions about what different kinds and focuses of relevance there may be, how these shift in the course of a talk exchange, how to allow for the fact that subjects of conversations are legitimately changed, and so on. I find the treatment of such questions exceedingly difficult, and I hope to revert to them in later work."&lt;ref name="grice"/&gt;

===Maxim of manner===
====Supermaxim:====
* ''Be perspicuous.''

==== Submaxims: ====
# Avoid obscurity of expression.
# Avoid ambiguity.
# Be brief (avoid unnecessary [[Verbosity|prolixity]]).
# Be orderly.

==Explanation==
These maxims may also be understood as describing the assumptions listeners normally make about the way speakers will talk, rather than prescriptions for how one ought to talk. Philosopher [[Kent Bach]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...[W]e need first to get clear on the character of Grice's maxims. They are not sociological generalizations about speech, nor they are moral prescriptions or proscriptions on what to say or communicate. Although Grice presented them in the form of guidelines for how to communicate successfully, I think they are better construed as presumptions about utterances, presumptions that we as listeners rely on and as speakers exploit (Bach 2005).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gricean maxims generate implicatures. If the overt, surface meaning of a sentence does not seem to be consistent with the Gricean maxims, and yet the circumstances lead us to think that the speaker is nonetheless obeying the cooperative principle, we tend to look for other meanings that could be implied by the sentence.

Grice did not, however, assume that all people should constantly follow these maxims. Instead, he found it interesting when these were not respected, namely either "flouted" (with the listener being expected to be able to understand the message) or "violated" (with the listener being expected to not note this). Flouting would imply some other, hidden meaning. The importance was in what was ''not'' said. For example, answering ''It's raining'' to someone who has suggested playing a game of tennis only disrespects the maxim of relation on the surface; the reasoning behind this "fragment" sentence is normally clear to the interlocutor (the maxim is just "flouted").

==Flouting the maxims==
It is possible to flout a maxim and thereby convey a different meaning than what is literally spoken.&lt;ref name="grice" /&gt; Many times in conversation, this flouting is manipulated by a speaker to produce a negative pragmatic effect, as with [[sarcasm]] or [[irony]]. One can flout the maxim of quality to tell a clumsy friend who has just taken a bad fall that her gracefulness is impressive and obviously intend to mean the complete opposite. Likewise, flouting the maxim of quantity may result in ironic understatement, the maxim of relevance in blame by irrelevant praise, and the maxim of manner in ironic ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufer|first=D. S.|year=1981|title=Understanding ironic communication|url=|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=5|pages=495–510|doi=10.1016/0378-2166(81)90015-1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gricean maxims are therefore often purposefully flouted by [[comedian]]s and writers, who may hide the complete truth and manipulate their words for the effect of the story and the sake of the reader's experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2014/06/20/at_least_ten_ducks_why_this_caption_is_funny_explained_by_gricean_maxims.html|title="Look At All These Ducks There Are At Least Ten." Why Is This Funny?|last1=McCulloch|first1=Gretchen|website=[[Slate (magazine)]]|publisher=[[The Slate Group]]|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{citation needed span|text=Speakers who deliberately flout the maxims usually intend for their listener to understand their underlying implication. In the case of the clumsy friend, she will most likely understand that the speaker is not truly offering a compliment. Therefore, cooperation is still taking place, but no longer on the literal level. Conversationalists can assume that when speakers intentionally flout a maxim, they still do so with the aim of expressing some thought. Thus, the Gricean maxims serve a purpose both when they are followed and when they are flouted.|date=January 2018}}

==Criticism ==
Grice's theory is often disputed by arguing that cooperative conversation, like most social behaviour, is culturally determined, and therefore the Gricean maxims and the cooperative principle cannot be universally applied due to intercultural differences. Keenan claims that the [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]], for example, follow a completely opposite cooperative principle in order to achieve conversational cooperation. In their culture, speakers are reluctant to share information and flout the maxim of quantity by evading direct questions and replying on incomplete answers because of the risk of losing face by committing oneself to the truth of the information, as well as the fact that having information is a form of prestige.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keenan |first=Elinor Ochs. |year=1976 |title=On the universality of conversational postulates |journal=Language in Society |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=67–80. |doi=10.1017/s0047404500006850}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Harnish points out&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harnish |first=R. |year=1976 |chapter=Logical form and implicature |title=An Integrated Theory of Linguistic Ability |editor=Bever T G |editor2=Katz J J |editor3=Langendoen, D T |publisher=New York: Crowel.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Grice only claims his maxims hold in conversations where his cooperative principle is in effect. The Malagasy speakers choose not to be cooperative, valuing the prestige of information ownership more highly. 
(It could also be said in this case that this is a less cooperative communication system, since less information is shared)

Another criticism is that the Gricean maxims can easily be misinterpreted to be a guideline for [[etiquette]], instructing speakers on how to be moral, polite conversationalists. However, the Gricean maxims, despite their wording, are only meant to describe the commonly accepted traits of successful cooperative communication. [[Geoffrey Leech]] introduced the [[politeness maxims]]: tact, [[generosity]], approbation, modesty, [[consensus|agreement]], and [[sympathy]].

&lt;/ref&gt; the '''Coulomb gap''' is a soft gap in the Single-Particle [[Density of states|Density of States]]  (DOS) of a system of interacting localized electrons.
Due to the long-range Coulomb interactions, the single-particle DOS vanishes at the chemical potential, at low enough temperatures, such that thermal excitations do not wash out the gap.

== Theory ==
At zero temperature, a classical treatment of a system gives an upper bound for the DOS near the [[Fermi]]-energy, first suggested by [[Alexei L. Efros|Efros]] and [[Boris Shklovskii|Shklovskii]].&lt;ref name="EfrosShklovskii1"&gt;A L Efros and B I Shklovskii , J. Phys. C8, L49 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is as follows:
Let us look at the [[ground state]] configuration of the system. Defining &lt;math&gt; E_i &lt;/math&gt; as the energy of an [[electron]] at site &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;, due to the disorder and the Coulomb interaction with all other electrons (we define this both for occupied and unoccupied sites), it is easy to see that the energy needed to move an electron from an occupied site &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; to an unoccupied site &lt;math&gt; j &lt;/math&gt; is given by the expression:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E=E_j-E_i-e^2/r_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;.
The subtraction of the last term accounts for the fact that &lt;math&gt; E_j &lt;/math&gt; contains a term due to the interaction with the electron present at site &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;, but after moving the electron this term should not be considered. It is easy to see from this that there exists an energy &lt;math&gt; E_f &lt;/math&gt; such that all sites with energies above it are empty, and below it are full (this is the Fermi energy, but since we are dealing with a system with interactions it is not obvious a-priori that it is still well-defined).
Assume we have a finite single-particle DOS at the Fermi energy, &lt;math&gt; g(E_f) &lt;/math&gt;. For every possible transfer of an electron from an occupied site i to an unoccupied site j, the energy invested should be positive, since we are assuming we are in the ground state of the system, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\Delta E&gt;=0 &lt;/math&gt;.
Assuming we have a large system, let us consider all the sites with energies in the interval &lt;math&gt; [E_f-\epsilon, E_f+\epsilon].  &lt;/math&gt; The number of these, by assumption, is  &lt;math&gt;  N= 2 \epsilon g(E_f).  &lt;/math&gt; As explained, &lt;math&gt; N/2&lt;/math&gt; of these would be occupied, and the others unoccupied. Of all pairs of occupied and unoccupied sites, let us choose the one where the two are closest to each other. If we assume the sites are randomly distributed in space, we find that the distance between these two sites is of order:
&lt;math&gt;  R \sim (N/V)^{-1/d} &lt;/math&gt;, where d is the dimension of space.
Plugging the expression for &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; into the previous equation, we obtain the inequality:
&lt;math&gt; E_j-E_i-C e^2 (\epsilon g(E_f)/V)^{1/d} &gt;0 &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; C&lt;/math&gt; is a coefficient of order unity. Since  &lt;math&gt; E_j-E_i &lt;2\epsilon &lt;/math&gt;, this inequality will necessarily be violated for small enough &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;. Hence, assuming a finite DOS at &lt;math&gt; E_f &lt;/math&gt; led to a contradiction. Repeating the above calculation under the assumption that the DOS near &lt;math&gt; E_f &lt;/math&gt; is proportional to &lt;math&gt; (E-E_f)^\alpha &lt;/math&gt; shows that &lt;math&gt; \alpha&gt;=d-1 &lt;/math&gt;.  This is an upper bound for the Coulomb gap. Efros &lt;ref&gt;A. L. Efros, J. Phys. C: Solid State Phys 9, 2021 (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; considered single electron excitations, and obtained an integro-differential equation for the DOS, showing the Coulomb gap in fact  follows the above equation (i.e., the upper bound is a tight bound).

Other treatments of the problem include a mean-field numerical approach,&lt;ref&gt;M. Grunewald, B. Pohlmann, L. Schweitzer, and D.Wurtz,J. Phys. C: Solid State Phys., 15, L1153 (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as more recent treatments such as,&lt;ref&gt;M. Muller and S. Pankov, Phys. Rev. B. 75, 144201 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; also verifying the upper bound suggested above is a tight bound. Many Monte-Carlo simulations were also performed,&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Davies, P. A. Lee, and T. M. Rice, Phys. Rev. Lett. 49, 758 - 761 (1982)
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Mobius, M. Richter, and B. Drittler, Phys. Rev. B 45, 11568 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;  some of them in disagreement with the result quoted above. Few works deal with the quantum aspect of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;G. Vignale, Phys. Rev. B 36, 8192(1987)
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experimental observations ==

Direct experimental confirmation of the gap has been done via tunneling experiments, which probed the single-particle DOS in two and three dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;J. G. Massey and M. Lee, Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, 4266 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. Y. Butko, J. F. Ditusa, and P. W. Adams, Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 1543 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments clearly showed a linear gap in two-dimensions, and a parabolic gap in three-dimensions.
Another experimental consequence of the Coulomb gap is found in the conductivity of samples in the localized regime.
The existence of a gap in the spectrum of excitations would result in a lowered conductivity than that predicted by [[Variable range hopping|Mott Variable range hopping]]. If one uses the analytical expression of the Single-Particle DOS in the Mott derivation, a universal &lt;math&gt; e^{-1/T^{1/2}} &lt;/math&gt; is obtained, for any dimension.&lt;ref&gt;B. Shklovskii and A. Efros, Electronic properties of doped
semiconductors (Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; The observation of this is expected to occur below a certain temperature, such that the optimal energy of hopping would be smaller than the width of the Coulomb gap. The transition from Mott to so-called Efros-Shklovskii Variable Range Hopping has been observed experimentally for various systems.&lt;ref&gt;A. Y. Rogatchev and U. Mizutani, Phys. Rev. B. 61, 15550
(2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, no rigorous derivation of the Efros-Shklovskii conductivity formula has been put forth, and in some experiments &lt;math&gt; e^{-1/T^{\alpha}} &lt;/math&gt; behavior is observed, for alpha which fits neither the Mott nor the Efros-Shklovskii theories.

The depiction of '''disability in the media''' plays a major role in molding the public perception of [[disability]]. Perceptions portrayed in the [[journalism|media]] directly influence the way people with disabilities are treated in current society. "[Media platforms] have been cited as a key site for the reinforcement of negative images and ideas in regard to people with disabilities."&lt;ref name="Supercrip"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physed.otago.ac.nz/sosol/v7i1/v7i1_1.html |title=sosol:Sociology of Sport Online - Volume 7 Issue 1 |publisher=Physed.otago.ac.nz |date=May 2001 |accessdate=18 June 2012 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121220075938/http://physed.otago.ac.nz/sosol/v7i1/v7i1_1.html |archivedate=20 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a direct response, there have been increasing examples worldwide of people with disabilities pursuing their own media projects, such as creating [[film series]] centered on disability issues, [[radio program]]s and [[podcast]]s designed around and marketed towards those with disabilities, and so on.

==Common depictions==
The media generally depicts people with disabilities according to common stereotypes such as [[pity]] and [[heroism]].
Disability advocates often call this type of societal situation the "pity/heroism trap" or "pity/heroism dichotomy" and call instead for its supporters to "[[Piss On Pity]]" and push forward with [[inclusion (disability rights)|inclusion]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ralston|first1=D. Christopher|last2=Ho|first2=Justin|title=Philosophical Reflections on Disability|date=19 September 2009|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j104ZMs0_-MC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=%22piss+on+pity%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=A4C-ulDwWz&amp;sig=MBPI3xU2aM4kkvl53TVvGplss40&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHo5-N2ITSAhWl2YMKHUMlAGU4KBDoAQgrMAU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When reports are about the "plight of the disabled" they rely on the pity or [[medical model of disability]]. [[Telethon]]s are an example of this, such as the [[Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon]] which has been heavily criticised and sometimes even [[street protest|physically protested]] by [[disability rights]] advocates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabble.ca/news/nutty-profess-ion "The Nutty Profess-ion" article] from ''Rabble News''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Longmore|first1=Paul K.|title=Telethons: Spectacle, Disability, and the Business of Charity|date=26 January 2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190262075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative day-to-day reporting may occur chiefly by depicting a given person or people with a disability as a burden or drain on society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barnes|first1=Colin|title=Disabling Imagery and the Media|url=http://disability-studies.leeds.ac.uk/files/library/Barnes-disabling-imagery.pdf|website=Disability Studies|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "super-crip" model, in which subjects are portrayed as heroically overcoming their afflictions, is also often used when reporting on people with disabilities.&lt;ref name="Supercrip1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Mary|title=Press victimization of disabled people|url=http://mediaschool.indiana.edu/research-2/ethics-case-studies/the-super-crip-stereotype/|website=Indiana University Bloomington|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Social model of disability|social model]] tends to be used for reporting on the activities of disability rights activists if the report is positive.&lt;ref name="Supercrip2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Indiana University School of Journalism |url=http://journalism.indiana.edu/resources/ethics/sensitive-news-topics/the-super-crip-stereotype/ |title=Archive " The "super-crip" stereotype " Ethics cases online |publisher=Journalism.indiana.edu |date=1988-02-08 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[inspiration porn]]" was coined in 2012 by disability rights activist [[Stella Young]] in an editorial in [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s webzine ''Ramp Up''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young |first=Stella |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-07-03/young-inspiration-porn/4107006 |title=We're not here for your inspiration - The Drum (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2012-07-03 |accessdate=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term describes when people with disabilities are called ''inspirational'' solely or in part on the basis of their disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Stella |last=Young |authorlink=Stella Young |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/stella_young_i_m_not_your_inspiration_thank_you_very_much?language=en |title=Stella Young: I’m not your inspiration, thank you very much &amp;#124; TED Talk |publisher=TED.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/2015/02/02/inspiration_porn_is_not_okay_disability_activists_are_not_impressed_with_feel_good_super_bowl_ads/ | title="Inspiration porn is not okay": Disability activists are not impressed with feel-good Super Bowl ads | website=Salon.com | date=2 February 2015 | accessdate=19 August 2015 | author=Heideman, Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stereotypes and Tropes===
Stereotypical depictions of disability that originate in the arts, film, literature, television, and other mass media fiction works, are frequently normalized through repetition to the general audience. Once such a stereotype is absorbed and accepted by the mainstream public, it continues to be repeated in the media, in many slightly varied forms, but staying close to the stereotype. Many media stereotypes about disability have been identified. They are sometimes referred to as "[[trope (literature)|tropes]]", meaning a recurring image or representation in the mainstream culture that is widely recognizable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fahnestock|first=Jeanne|title=Rhetorical Style: The Uses of Language in Persuasion|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780199764129|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tropes repeated in works of fiction have an influence on how society at large perceives people with disabilities. Other forms of media, in turn, then portray people with disabilities in ways that conform with tropes and repeat them. 

Some of these disability tropes (which may or may not be harmful) that have been identified in popular culture include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disability Tropes: Television Tropes &amp; Idioms|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilityTropes|publisher=[[tvtropes.org]]|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Little People are Surreal"
::Examples of this include the character Tattoo on the television series ''[[Fantasy Island]]''; a recurring use of a dwarf as a motif in American film director [[David Lynch]]'s works, such as ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''; and a dwarf actor who appears as a prominent cast extra in the film ''[[The Eyes of Laura Mars]]''.
* "Single Episode Disability"
::This is where a regular character on a television series obtains a temporary disability, learns a moral lesson, and makes a rapid, full recovery. Examples include an episode of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' where [[Hawkeye Pierce#Hawkeye Pierce|Hawkeye]] is temporarily blinded, and an episode of ''[[Law and Order: SVU]]'' where Detective Stabler is temporarily blind.
* "Disability Superpower"
::This is where fate removes one ability, it enhances another, so that a disabled character has one superpower. This has resulted in the creation of several subtypes of this disability trope, such as Blind Seer, Blind Weapon Master, Genius Cripple and Super Wheel Chair.

Other disability stereotypes that have been identified in popular culture include:&lt;ref name="BaglieriSusan"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Baglieri, Susan  |author2=Arthur Shapiro|title=Disability Studies and the Inclusive Classroom: Critical Practices for Creating Least Restrictive Attitudes|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=9781136870248|page=No page}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The object of pity
::With this, disability is commonly associated with an illness or disease.
::See [[inspiration porn]]
* Sinister or evil
::Characters who are portrayed as having physical disabilities are cast as the anti-hero.
* Eternal innocence
::Paired with people with intellectual disabilities, such as in the films ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', ''[[I Am Sam]]'' and ''[[Rainman]]''.
* The victim of violence 
* Asexual, undesirable, or incapable of sexual or romantic interactions:
::Examples include adolescent coming-of-age storylines such as [[Artie Abrams]] on ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', and “teen sick-lit” such as ''[[The Fault in Our Stars|The Fault in our Stars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chronic youth disability, sexuality, and U.S. media cultures of rehabilitation|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09687599.2015.1062226|journal = Disability &amp; Society|date = 2015-07-14|issn = 0968-7599|pages = 1–3|volume = 0|issue = 0|doi = 10.1080/09687599.2015.1062226|first = Jenny|last = Slater}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of disability tropes in mass media is related to other stereotypes, or tropes, that have developed when other marginalized groups in society are depicted, such as the [[Magical Negro]] trope identified, and criticized, by film director [[Spike Lee]]. The mocking names often given to these tropes when they are identified indicates a rejection of the harmful stereotypes that they propagate.

Stereotypes may endure in a culture for several reasons: they are constantly reinforced in the culture, which mass media does easily and effectively; they reflect a common human need to organize people and categorize them; they reinforce discrimination that allows one group of society to exploit and marginalize another group.&lt;ref name="BaglieriSusan" /&gt; Several studies of mass media in Britain and the United States have identified common stereotypes, such as "noble warrior", "charity cripple", "curio", "freak", and "Pollyanna", where the researchers identified a position of "disapproval", on the part of the media, of some aspect of the disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shakespeare|first=Tom|title=The Disability Reader: Social Science Perspectives|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1998|isbn=9780826453600|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that media portrayals of disability became more normalizing and accepting in the years immediately after [[World War II]], when returning veterans with war-related disabilities were being reintegrated into society. A backlash of intolerance towards disability followed during the mid-20th century, with some researchers speculating that this may have been related to society's reaction against any identifiable "difference" as a result of Cold War tensions. Depictions of disability in media soon reverted to emphasizing the "freakish" nature of disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shakespeare|first=Tom|title=The Disability Reader: Social Science Perspectives|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1998|isbn=9780826453600|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast media programming for disabled audiences==
Broadcast media has in recent years begun to recognize the large audience of people with disabilities that it reaches. Programming dedicated to disability issues is increasing.

In 1990, the signing of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA) became the first news story on disability issues to become a lead story on cable news broadcaster [[CNN]]. News Director [[Ed Turner (television executive)|Ed Turner]] contacted the Washington bureau of CNN to have the signing of the ADA by President Bush broadcast live. The next day, the signing of the ADA was covered as the top headline in the ''[[New York Times]]'', the ''[[Washington Post]]'', and every other major U.S. newspaper. Disability rights activist [[Lex Frieden]] has stated, "That was the first time that millions of people were exposed to disability rights as the number one story".&lt;ref name="DorisZames"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Doris Zames Fleischer |author2=Frieda Zames |title=The Disability Rights Movement: From Charity to Confrontation|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2001|isbn=9781566398121|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; These milestones were a major change in reducing exclusion and invisibility for people with disabilities.

''Ouch!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/podcast/ |title=Ouch! (disability) - Podcast |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], ''The Largest Minority''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://largestminority.org/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110040227/http://largestminority.org/ |archivedate=2016-11-10 |title=Largest Minority Radio Show &amp;#124; news and views from the community of people with disabilities |publisher=Web-beta.archive.org |date=2016-11-10 |accessdate=2017-04-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; broadcast in [[New York City]], and ''Dtv''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Our Story |url=http://www.deaftv.co.za/our-story/ |title=The Story of DTV |publisher=Deaftv.co.za |date= |accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented in [[South African Sign Language|sign language]] on [[SABC]] television in [[South Africa]], are examples of programming produced for, and usually also by, people with disabilities.

[[Radio reading service]]s are radio stations that broadcast readings from newspapers, magazines and books to mainly blind or partially sighted audiences.

In recent years, some mainstream publications and broadcasters have added writing and programming about disability-related topics. The Creative Diversity Network in the United Kingdom is an organization that advocates increased cultural and disability-related programming. Clare Morrow, the organization's Network Manager, states that "Disability is now at the heart of the diversity agenda for all of the UK's main television companies, thanks to their collective work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=News and events|url=http://www.creativediversitynetwork.org/news.php|publisher=Creative Diversity Network|accessdate=July 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The BBC Website includes ''Ouch!'', a disability news and discussion blog and internet talk show program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ouch! Blog|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ouch/|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)|accessdate=July 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications and broadcasts by disability related organisations==
Many activist and charitable organisations have websites and publish their own magazines or newsletters.

==Disability in documentary film==
Disability has been shown to audiences since the early days of documentary film. Educational silent films showing hospital patients with various disabling conditions were shown to medical and nursing students. Films of [[schizophrenia]] patients with symptoms of [[catatonia]], [[World War I]] veterans with extreme [[Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder]] (PTSD) ([[shell-shock]]) symptoms, and many other such films survive today. [[Michael J. Dowling]] (1866-1921) was a prominent [[Minnesota]] politician and newspaper publisher, who was also a quadruple amputee. World War I inspired him to further the cause of veterans with disabilities. Dowling had himself filmed performing routine tasks on his own, and had the films screened for groups such as the [[American Medical Association]] in 1918. His efforts promoted the rehabilitation of the physically disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael J. Dowling Silent Film, Museum Collections Up Close: MNHS.ORG|url=http://discussions.mnhs.org/collections/2011/06/michael-j-dowling-silent-film/|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documentary films sometimes had a tone that was a reflection of the public's morbid curiosity about visible disabilities that were considered shameful and ordinarily were hidden from public view. Nazi propagandists exploited this fear and prejudice to push the public to accept their [[euthanasia]] policies, including forcible sterilization, by screening films showing people with mental retardation and physical disabilities living in squalid conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marini, Irmo |author2=Noreen M. Glover-Graf |author3=Michael Jay Millington |title=Psychosocial Aspects of Disability: Insider Perspectives and Counseling Strategies|year=2011|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|isbn=9780826106025|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, American President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his White House staff made a great effort to disguise his handicap (Roosevelt became [[paraplegic]] after contracting [[polio]] as an adult). Roosevelt was photographed and filmed only from positions that would hide his disability from the public, for fear that he would be perceived as weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marini, Irmo |author2=Noreen M. Glover-Graf |author3=Michael Jay Millington |title=Psychosocial Aspects of Disability: Insider Perspectives and Counseling Strategies|year=2011|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|isbn=9780826106025|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, documentary films about disability have been widely viewed on both public and cable television programming. The [[Channel 5 (UK)]] program ''Extraordinary Lives'', and [[Channel 4]] program ''Body Shock'' in the United Kingdom, broadcast much documentary material about disability. Titles of some documentary programming includes: "''The Boy Who Sees Without Eyes'' — the 14-year-old American boy who navigates by sound; ''The Twin Within the Twin'' — the 34-year-old Bengali who carries his foetal twin within his abdomen; and ''The Twins Who Share a Body'' — Abby and Brittany Hensel, the world's only known dicephalus twins, ie. two heads with one body".&lt;ref name="LeeWrightPeter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee-Wright|first=Peter|title=The Documentary Handbook|year=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780415434010|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the documentaries, perceived to be in the "shock doc" (shock documentary) genre, have been denounced by critics with disabilities. Although the documentary programming contains educational and scientific information, the sensationalized, overt emotional appeal of the "tabloid tone" of the programming has raised objections. Laurence Clark has written in the BBC Website's disability blog ''Ouch!'': {{blockquote|During these programs I often find myself screaming at the TV: 'Where the hell do they find these people?!' I suspect that someone somewhere has set up an agency called Rent-a-Freak, specifically to supply the most bizarre, eccentric disabled people they can find to budding documentary makers. But unlike today's documentary subjects, the freaks of old were at least paid to take part — and had some say over their performances.&lt;ref name="LeeWrightPeter" /&gt; }}

==Documentary photography==
[[File:Blind man carrying a paralysed man.jpg|thumb|A blind man carrying a paralyzed man on his back in the Levant, photo by [[Tancrède Dumas]], circa 1889.]]
The first photographer to become widely known for depicting the visibly disabled was [[Diane Arbus]], active in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.biography.com/people/diane-arbus-9187461|title = Diane Arbus Biography|date = |access-date = 2016-02-16|website = Biography.com|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her photographs, which are in fact art photographs, have been, and remain, highly controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = A Fresh Look at Diane Arbus|url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/a-fresh-look-at-diane-arbus-99861134/?all|website = Smithsonian|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American documentary photographers Tom Olin and Harvey Finkle, known for documenting the [[disability rights movement]] since the 1980s, have exhibited at many venues including the National Constitution Center Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCC Marks Americans with Disabilities Act anniversary|url=http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2012/07/ncc-marks-americans-with-disabilities-act-anniversary/|publisher=Annenberg Center for Education and Outreach at the National Constitution Center|accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses==
Members of the public with disabilities have criticized media depictions of disability on the grounds that stereotypes are commonly repeated. Media coverage that is "negative", "unrealistic", or displays a preference for the "pitiful" and "sensationalistic" over the "everyday and human side of disability"&lt;ref name="Catherine"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Catherine A. Luther |author2=Carolyn Ringer Lepre |author3=Naeemah Clark |title=Diversity in U.S. Mass Media|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=9781444344516|page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; are identified at the root of the dissatisfaction. Journalist Leye Jeannette Chrzanowski, who uses a wheelchair, has written:{{blockquote|Many people with disabilities believe mainstream journalists are incapable of accurately covering stories about them. Generally, journalists either portray us as pitiful cripples, super achievers, or insane mental patients. These erroneous media stereotypes of people with disabilities are perpetuated because journalists consistently fail to understand or learn about people with disabilities and the issues that are important to us.&lt;ref name="Catherine" /&gt;}}

Various organisations and programmes have been established to try to positively influence the frequency and quality of reporting on disability issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaanddisability.org/ |title=Media &amp; Disability. home |publisher=Mediaanddisability.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-disability.net/ |title=Media &amp; Disability Resources |publisher=media-disability.net |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-disability.org/ |title=European Congress on Media and Disability - Homepage |publisher=Media-disability.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, it was estimated that in the United States, there were between 3000 and 3500 newsletters, 200 magazines, and 50 to 60 newspapers regularly published that focussed on disability issues.&lt;ref name="DorisZames" /&gt;

Disability lobbyists for the American Disability Association (ADA), are unable to rely on the media as a source to support and spread their ideas on disability because they believe that the media will continue to misrepresent the disabled community since they are more interested in the stereotypes of disabled people than in the facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edo&amp;AN=95095924&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|title=EBSCOhost Login|author=|date=|website=search.ebscohost.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a prism, [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] causes different colors to [[refraction|refract]] at different angles, splitting white light into a rainbow of colors.]]
In [[physical sciences]] and [[electrical engineering]], '''dispersion relations''' describe the effect of [[#Dispersion|dispersion]] in a medium on the properties of a wave traveling within that medium. A dispersion relation relates the [[wavelength]] or [[wavenumber]] of a wave to its [[frequency]]. From this relation the [[phase velocity]] and [[group velocity]] of the wave have convenient expressions which then determine the [[refractive index]] of the medium. More general than the geometry-dependent and material-dependent dispersion relations, there are the overarching [[Kramers–Kronig relation]]s that describe the frequency dependence of [[wave propagation]] and [[attenuation]].

Dispersion may be caused either by geometric boundary conditions ([[waveguide]]s, shallow water) or by interaction of the waves with the transmitting medium. [[Elementary particle]]s, considered as [[matter wave]]s, have a nontrivial dispersion relation even in the absence of geometric constraints and other media.

In the presence of dispersion, wave velocity is no longer uniquely defined, giving rise to the distinction of [[phase velocity]] and [[group velocity]].

==Dispersion==
{{main|Dispersion (optics)|Dispersion (water waves)|Acoustic dispersion}}
Dispersion occurs when pure plane waves of different wavelengths have different propagation velocities, so that a [[wave packet]] of mixed wavelengths tends to spread out in space. The speed of a plane wave, ''v'', is a function of the wave's wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;v = v(\lambda).\,&lt;/math&gt;

The wave's speed, wavelength, and frequency, ''f'', are related by the identity

:&lt;math&gt;v(\lambda) = \lambda\ f(\lambda).\,&lt;/math&gt;

The function &lt;math&gt; f(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; expresses the dispersion relation of the given medium. Dispersion relations are more commonly expressed in terms of the [[angular frequency]] &lt;math&gt;\omega=2\pi f&lt;/math&gt; and [[wavenumber]] &lt;math&gt;k=2 \pi /\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. Rewriting the relation above in these variables gives

:&lt;math&gt;\omega(k)= v(k)\ k.\,&lt;/math&gt;

where we now view ''f'' as a function of ''k''. The use of ω(''k'') to describe the dispersion relation has become standard because both the [[phase velocity]] ω/''k'' and the [[group velocity]] dω/d''k'' have convenient representations via this function.

The plane waves being considered can be described by

:&lt;math&gt;A(x, t) = A_0e^{2 \pi i \frac{x - v t}{\lambda}}= A_0e^{i (k x - \omega t)},&lt;/math&gt;

where 
:''A'' is the amplitude of the wave,
:''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''A''(0,0),
:''x'' is a position along the wave's direction of travel, and
:''t'' is the time at which the wave is described.

==Plane waves in vacuum==

Plane waves in vacuum are the simplest case of wave propagation: no geometric constraint, no interaction with a transmitting medium.

===Electromagnetic waves in a vacuum===

For [[electromagnetic wave]]s in vacuum, the angular frequency is proportional to the wavenumber:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = c k.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This is a ''linear'' dispersion relation. In this case, the phase velocity and the group velocity are the same:

:&lt;math&gt; v = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{d\omega}{d k} = c;&lt;/math&gt;

they are given by ''c'', the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, a frequency-independent constant.

===De Broglie dispersion relations===

[[Image:KEvsMOMENTUM.png|thumb|350px|right|The free-space dispersion plot of kinetic energy versus momentum, for many objects of everyday life.]]

Total energy, momentum, and mass of particles are connected through the [[Energy-momentum relation|relativistic dispersion relation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;E^2 = \left(mc^2\right)^2 + \left(pc\right)^2\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Taylor| title=Classical Mechanics|publisher=University Science Books|page= 652| isbn=1-891389-22-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which in the ultrarelativistic limit is
: &lt;math&gt; E = p c\,&lt;/math&gt;

and in the nonrelativistic limit is

: &lt;math&gt;E = m c^2 + \frac{p^2}{2m}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the rest mass.  In the nonrelativistic limit, &lt;math&gt;m c^2&lt;/math&gt; is a constant and &lt;math&gt;p^2/2 m&lt;/math&gt; is the familiar kinetic energy expressed in terms of the momentum &lt;math&gt;p = m v&lt;/math&gt;.

The transition from [[Ultrarelativistic limit|ultrarelativistic]] to nonrelativistic behaviour shows up as a slope change from ''p'' to ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as shown in the log-log dispersion plot of ''E'' vs. ''p''.

Elementary particles, atomic nuclei, atoms, and even molecules behave in some contexts as matter waves. According to the [[de Broglie relations]], their [[kinetic energy]] ''E'' can be expressed as a frequency ''ω'', and their [[momentum]] ''p'' as a wavenumber ''k'', using the reduced [[Planck constant]] ħ:

: &lt;math&gt;E = \hbar\omega,\quad p = \hbar k.&lt;/math&gt;

Accordingly, angular frequency and wavenumber are connected through a dispersion relation,
which in the nonrelativistic limit reads

: &lt;math&gt;\omega=\frac{\hbar k^2}{2m}.&lt;/math&gt;

|-
| [[Image:deBroglie3.gif|frame|center]]
This animation portrays the de Broglie phase and group velocities (in slow motion) of three free electrons traveling over a field 0.4 Ångstroms in width. The momentum per unit mass (proper velocity) of the middle electron is lightspeed, so that its group velocity is 0.707 ''c''. The top electron has twice the momentum, while the bottom electron has half.  Note that as the momentum increases, the phase velocity decreases down to ''c'', whereas the group velocity increases up to ''c'', until the wave packet and its phase maxima move together near the speed of light, whereas the wavelength continues to decrease without bound. Both transverse and longitudinal coherence widths (packet sizes) of such high energy electrons in the lab may be orders of magnitude larger than the ones shown here.

==Frequency versus wavenumber==
As mentioned above, when the focus in a medium is on refraction rather than absorption—that is, on the real part of the [[refractive index]]—it is common to refer to the functional dependence of angular frequency on wavenumber as the ''dispersion relation''. For particles, this translates to a knowledge of energy as a function of momentum.

===Waves and optics===
{{See|Dispersion (optics)}}
The name "dispersion relation" originally comes from [[optics]]. It is possible to make the effective speed of light dependent on wavelength by making light pass through a material which has a non-constant [[index of refraction]], or by using light in a non-uniform medium such as a [[waveguide]]. In this case, the waveform will spread over time, such that a narrow pulse will become an extended pulse, i.e., be dispersed. In these materials, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k}&lt;/math&gt; is known as the [[group velocity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=F. A. Jenkins and H. E. White |date=1957|title=Fundamentals of optics|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York| page=223| isbn=0-07-032330-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and corresponds to the speed at which the peak of the pulse  propagates, a value different from the [[phase velocity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= R. A. Serway, C. J. Moses and C. A. Moyer |year=1989| title=Modern Physics| publisher=Saunders|location=Philadelphia|page= 118|isbn= 0-534-49340-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deep water waves===
{{See|Dispersion (water waves)|Airy wave theory}}
[[Image:Wave group.gif|frame|right|Frequency dispersion of surface gravity waves on deep water. The {{colorbull|red|circle}} red dot moves with the phase velocity, and the {{colorbull|limegreen|circle}} green dots propagate with the group velocity. In this deep-water case, the phase velocity is twice the group velocity. The {{colorbull|red|circle}} red dot traverses the figure in the time it takes the green dot to traverse half.]]

The dispersion relation for deep [[ocean surface wave|water waves]] is often written as 

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{g k},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g'' is the acceleration due to gravity. Deep water, in this respect, is commonly denoted as the case where the water depth is larger than half the wavelength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Water wave mechanics for engineers and scientists | author=R. G. Dean and R. A. Dalrymple | year=1991 | series=Advanced Series on Ocean Engineering | volume=2 | publisher=World Scientific, Singapore | isbn=978-981-02-0420-4 }} See page 64–66.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the phase velocity is

:&lt;math&gt;v_p = \frac{\omega}{k} = \sqrt{\frac{g}{k}}&lt;/math&gt;

and the group velocity is

:&lt;math&gt;v_g = \frac{d{\omega}}{dk} = \frac{1}{2} v_p.&lt;/math&gt;

===Waves on a string===
{{See|Vibrating string}}
[[Image:Two-frequency beats of a non-dispersive transverse wave (animated).gif|frame|right|Two-frequency beats of a non-dispersive transverse wave. Since the wave is non-dispersive, {{colorbull|red|circle}} phase and {{colorbull|limegreen|circle}} group velocities are equal.]]

For an ideal string, the dispersion relation can be written as

: &lt;math&gt;\omega = k \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is the tension force in the string and ''μ'' is the string's mass per unit length. As for the case of electromagnetic waves in a vacuum, ideal strings are thus a non-dispersive medium i.e., the phase and group velocities are equal and independent (to first order) of vibration frequency.

For a nonideal string, where stiffness is taken into account, the dispersion relation is written as

: &lt;math&gt;\omega^2 = \frac{T}{\mu} k^2 + \alpha k^4&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a constant that depends on the string.

===Solid state===
In the study of solids, the study of the dispersion relation of electrons is of paramount importance. The periodicity of crystals means that many [[Fermi surface|levels of energy]] are possible for a given momentum and that some energies might not be available at any momentum. The collection of all possible energies and momenta is known as the [[band structure]] of a material. Properties of the band structure define whether the material is an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]], [[semiconductor]] or [[Conductor (material)|conductor]].

===Phonons===
Phonons are to sound waves in a solid what photons are to light: they are the quanta that carry it. The dispersion relation of [[phonon]]s is also non-trivial and important, being directly related to the acoustic and thermal properties of a material. For most systems, the phonons can be categorized into two main types: those whose bands become zero at the center of the [[Brillouin zone]] are called [[acoustic phonon]]s, since they correspond to classical sound in the limit of long wavelengths. The others are [[optical phonon]]s, since they can be excited by electromagnetic radiation.

===Electron optics===
With high energy (e.g., {{convert|200|keV|abbr=on|disp=comma}}) electrons in a [[transmission electron microscope]], the energy dependence of higher order [[Laue zone]] (HOLZ) lines in convergent beam [[electron diffraction]] (CBED) patterns allows one, in effect, to ''directly image'' cross-sections of a crystal's three-dimensional [[Brillouin zone|dispersion surface]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=P. M. Jones, G. M. Rackham and J. W. Steeds | year=1977|title= Higher order Laue zone effects in electron diffraction and their use in lattice parameter determination| journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society| volume=A 354
| page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Dynamical theory of diffraction|dynamical effect]] has found application in the precise measurement of lattice parameters, beam energy, and more recently for the electronics industry: lattice strain.

== History ==
[[Isaac Newton]] studied refraction in prisms but failed to recognize the material dependence of the dispersion relation, dismissing the work of another researcher whose measurement of a prism's dispersion did not match Newton's own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Never at Rest: A Biography of Isaac Newton |first=Richard S. |last=Westfall |edition=illustrated, revised |publisher=Cambridge University |date=1983 |isbn=9780521274357 |page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dispersion of waves on water was studied by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= A.D.D. Craik | year= 2004 | title= The origins of water wave theory | journal= Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics | volume= 36 | pages= 1–28 | doi=10.1146/annurev.fluid.36.050802.122118 |bibcode = 2004AnRFM..36....1C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The universality of the [[Kramers-Kronig relation]]s (1926–27) became apparent with subsequent papers on the dispersion relation's connection to causality in the [[scattering theory]] of all types of waves and particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =  10.1103/PhysRev.104.1760 | author =  John S. Toll | year=1956|title=Causality and the dispersion relation: Logical foundations|journal =Phys. Rev.| volume=104| pages=1760–1770|bibcode = 1956PhRv..104.1760T | issue =  6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''e-Administration''', or [[electronics|electronic]] administration, refers to any of a number of mechanisms which convert what in a traditional office are paper processes into electronic processes, with the goal being to create a [[paperless office]].  This is an ICT tool, with the goal being to improve productivity and performance.

e-Administration can encompass both intra-office and inter-office [[communication]] for any organization.

Its objective is to introduce total [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]] and [[accountability]] leading to better [[e-Governance]] within any organization.  In [[Germany]], this initiative is especially targeted at [[government]] organizations, where public accountability is of special concern.  Similar processes are being developed in many [[United States|American]] [[corporations]] to aid compliance with the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]].

The implementation of any e-administration solution should be customer centric rather than organization centric, should remove dependence on specific individuals, and should introduce transparent systems of working.  Examples of e-administration include, online timesheets and expense account. These can be used to help reduce costs to an organization.

==Overview==
The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) was founded in 1985 by [[Saad Eddin Ibrahim]] and [[Hani Shukrallah]].&lt;ref&gt;Beinin, 2011, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first human rights organization in the country and remains one of the most professional non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Egypt. Its headquarters is in Cairo, and has regional branches with a national membership of approximately 2,300 active volunteers in 17 provincial branches located across the country.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; EOHR is a non-profit NGO working within the framework of the principles established in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other [[international human rights instruments]] regardless of the identity or affiliation of the victim or violator .

EOHR acts and reports on both governmental and non-governmental human rights violations. According to its reports issues annually the decade of the late 1980s through to the late 1990s was marked by an increase in torture in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pHp4lsrx92AC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22+Egyptian+Organization+for+Human+Rights%22+1985&amp;num=100&amp;ei=WnRtS6iFM4fsyASLneStDg&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%20Egyptian%20Organization%20for%20Human%20Rights%22%201985&amp;f=false |title=Dictionary of human rights advocacy ... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=January 1, 1997 |accessdate=March 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rjj48T4zrb8C&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=%22+Egyptian+Organization+for+Human+Rights%22+1985&amp;num=100&amp;ei=WnRtS6iFM4fsyASLneStDg&amp;cd=18#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%20Egyptian%20Organization%20for%20Human%20Rights%22%201985&amp;f=false |title=Passion for Islam: Shaping the ... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=March 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the organization's activists were regularly harassed and arrested making their work increasingly difficult. Despite these challenges the organization maintained a steady accounting of state and non-state violations of human rights and started a series of publications of human rights books to raise awareness of human rights issues in the country. An attempt to start a theater company to tour villages with plays improvised on human rights topics was scrapped after the organizer was arrested by state security forces.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karim Alrawi|Karim Alrawi, see section heading "Arrest and Detention"]]&lt;/ref&gt; During the last decade of the Mubarak dictatorship the EOHR was represented, while maintaining its independence, on the state sponsored Supreme Council of Human Rights.

==EOHR's international status==
EOHR is part of the wider international and Arab human rights movement. It cooperates with the United Nations human rights bodies, as well as with other international and regional human rights organizations. EOHR was registered at the Ministry of Social Affairs in 2003 under registration No. 5220/2003.

EOHR was granted special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council in 2006. This consultative status enables EOHR to enjoy closer interaction with the United Nations by participating in the activities of the International Council for Human Rights, according to ECOSOC decision 31/1996. This decision aimed to reinforce the principles of the human rights stipulated in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the Vienna Declaration and all other international human rights documents. EOHR is also a member of five international organizations: the [[Arab Organization for Human Rights]] (AOHR), the [[World Organisation Against Torture]] (OMCT), [[International Federation for Human Rights]] (IFHR), the [[International Commission of Jurists]] (ICJ), and the [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]] (IFEX).

==Goals==
# To provide full respect for human rights and the basic freedoms of all Egyptians and non-Egyptians who are in Egypt, according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments. These include, in particular, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. EOHR defends the human rights of all individuals and groups against all forms of violation.
# To reform the Egyptian constitution and legislation to bring them into accordance with international human rights covenants and conventions.
# To promote the rule of law and full respect for an independent judiciary.
# To guarantee the right to participation in public affairs without discrimination due to opinion, religion, gender, race or color.
# To guarantee freedom of opinion and expression, in addition to artistic and literary invention.
# To guarantee freedom of belief, thought and religion.
# To ensure a fair trial for all defendants before a competent judge regardless of the kind of charge. To grant legal aid to those defendants if possible and necessary.
# To call for the release of those who are detained, or whose freedoms are restricted, due to the peaceful expression of their opinions or because of their beliefs, religion, race, gender or color.
# To provide legal aid to the victims of violations against the freedom of opinion and expression. In addition, to assist prisoners and detainees who are subject to torture or other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.
# To ensure that prison regulations and the treatment of prisoners are in conformity with the international Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.

==Working methods==
EOHR adopts peaceful methods to promote and defend human rights. It believes that the promotion of human rights is a common goal for the entire world community and it is determined to spare no peaceful effort in its struggle against human rights violations. His main actions are:

# Monitoring, observing and documenting the human rights violation and informing the official bodies about the violation incidents.
# Issuing press releases on the human rights violations.
# Providing legal support for the human rights'  violation victims.
# Holding open discussions on the Egyptian laws in order to comply with the international covenants of human rights. 
# Launching specific and specialized campaigns for raising awareness of the human rights issues. 
# Providing training for media and legal specialists on the human rights principles.
# Holding training workshops for EOHR members and others for raising awareness of human rights.
# Preparing researches on the human rights issues.
# Holding an annual meeting for discussing human rights' issues.
The EOHR accomplishes this by fact-finding missions. These include visits to prisons in order to collect testimonies, and to obtain document information about human rights violations. It also Issues urgent appeals, press releases, reports and publications on human rights violations. Furthermore, the EOHR tries to raise awareness on human rights issues among individuals and groups through publications, conferences, seminars and studies. In addition, this organization contacts Egyptian governmental and non-governmental bodies as well as international, regional and national organizations to seek co-operation, obtain information and take action to increase respect for human rights. Through the use of these methods the EOHR has adopted a peaceful method to promote and defend human rights in Egypt.

==Organizational structure==
The General Assembly of fee-paying members holds supreme authority in EOHR. A General Assembly meeting is convened once every other year to review and evaluate the organization’s progress and to elect the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees is the policy-making body within the EOHR and is led by the Chairman. It is made up of fifteen elected members, and up to four other prominent figures in the field of human rights can be invited by the Board of Trustees to join.

The Executive Board is elected by the Board of Trustees and consists of the Secretary-General, the Treasurer and representatives of the main committees of the organization. The Executive Board, led by the Secretary-General, is responsible for the day-to-day activities of the EOHR and for any decisions made in the interim period between meetings of the Board of Trustees.

EOHR has five substantive and inter-linked units, two projects and three auxiliary units:

;The Field Work Unit
The unit includes a number of lawyers who receive complaints on the human rights violations and do the required investigations in order to make sure that the complaint is serious. They receive individual allegations of human rights violations and investigate each case’s merits. Much of their work takes place in the field, on the ground, in prisons, in court, in detention centers, in homes, anywhere information can be found. The investigating lawyer writes an official report on each case. Then, depending on the nature and the merits of the case, the case may be removed from consideration or investigated further. Appeals and requests for information may be made to competent authorities and complainants may receive free legal counsel so that they can pursue a formal suit. All services made available to victims of human rights violations are absolutely free of charge.The unit does also the following:
* Conducting fact finding committees for capturing information and documentation of human rights'  violations.
* Addressing the concerned official bodies and submitting complaints to the Prosecutor General, the Minister of Interior, the Manager of the Prisons'  Authority, the Security Directorates' managers, Governors, ministries and embassies. 
;The Legal Support Unit

The law and algorithm were introduced in a semi-tutorial by Srinivas M. Aji and [[Robert McEliece|Robert J. McEliece]] with the same title.&lt;ref name=GenDistLaw /&gt;

==Introduction==

''"The distributive law in mathematics is the law relating the operations of multiplication and addition, stated symbolically, &lt;math&gt; a*(b + c) = a*b + a*c&lt;/math&gt;; that is, the monomial factor &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is distributed, or separately applied, to each term of the binomial factor &lt;math&gt; b + c &lt;/math&gt;, resulting in the product &lt;math&gt; a*b + a*c &lt;/math&gt;"'' -  Britannica&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=distributive law|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/166204/distributive-law|work=Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As it can be observed from the definition, application of distributive law to an arithmetic expression reduces the number of operations in it. In the previous example the total number of operations reduced from three (two multiplications and an addition in &lt;math&gt; a*b + a*c &lt;/math&gt;) to two (one multiplication and one addition in &lt;math&gt; a*(b + c) &lt;/math&gt;). Generalization of distributive law leads to a large family of [[fast algorithms]]. This includes the [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]] and [[Viterbi algorithm]].

This is explained in a more formal way in the example below:

&lt;math&gt;\alpha(a,\, b) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \displaystyle\sum \limits_{c,d,e \in A} f(a, \, c, \, b) \, g(a, \, d, \, e) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; are real-valued functions, &lt;math&gt;a,b,c,d,e \in A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|A|=q&lt;/math&gt; (say)

Here we are "marginalizing out" the independent variables (&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;) to obtain the result. When we are calculating the computational complexity, we can see that for each &lt;math&gt;q^{2}&lt;/math&gt; pairs of &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;, there are &lt;math&gt;q^{3}&lt;/math&gt; terms due to the triplet &lt;math&gt;(c,d,e)&lt;/math&gt; which needs to take part in the evaluation of &lt;math&gt;\alpha(a,\, b)&lt;/math&gt; with each step having one addition and one multiplication. Therefore, the total number of computations needed is &lt;math&gt;2\cdot q^2 \cdot q^3 = 2q^5&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the asymptotic complexity of the above function is &lt;math&gt;O(n^5)&lt;/math&gt;.

If we apply the distributive law to the RHS of the equation, we get the following:

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha(a, \, b) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}   \displaystyle\sum\limits_{c \in A} f(a, \, c, \, b ) \cdot \sum _{d,\,e \in A} g(a,\,d,\,e) &lt;/math&gt;

This implies that &lt;math&gt;\alpha(a, \, b)&lt;/math&gt; can be described as a product &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{1}(a,\, b) \cdot \alpha_{2}(a)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \alpha_{1}(a,b) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \displaystyle\sum\limits_{c \in A} f(a, \, c, \, b )&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{2}(a) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \displaystyle\sum\limits_{d,\,e \in A} g(a,\, d, \,e )&lt;/math&gt;

Now, when we are calculating the computational complexity, we can see that there are &lt;math&gt;q^{3}&lt;/math&gt; additions in &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{1}(a,\, b)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{2}(a)&lt;/math&gt; each and there are &lt;math&gt;q^2&lt;/math&gt; multiplications when we are using the product &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{1}(a,\, b) \cdot \alpha_{2}(a)&lt;/math&gt; to evaluate &lt;math&gt;\alpha(a, \, b)&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the total number of computations needed is &lt;math&gt;q^3 + q^3 + q^2 = 2q^3 + q^2&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the asymptotic complexity of calculating &lt;math&gt;\alpha(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; reduces to &lt;math&gt;O(n^{3})&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;O(n^{5})&lt;/math&gt;.  This shows by an example that applying distributive law reduces the computational complexity which is one of the good features of a "fast algorithm".

==History==

Some of the problems that used distributive law to solve can be grouped as follows

1. Decoding algorithms&lt;br&gt;
A GDL like algorithm was used by Gallager's for decoding low density parity-check codes. Based on Gallager's work Tanner introduced the [[Tanner graph]] and expressed Gallagers work in message passing form. The tanners graph also helped explain the  [[Viterbi algorithm]].

It is observed by Forney that Viterbi's maximum likelihood decoding of [[convolutional codes]] also used algorithms of GDL-like generality.

2. [[Forward-backward algorithm]]&lt;br&gt;
The forward backward algorithm helped as an algorithm for tracking the states in the [[markov chain]]. And this also was used the algorithm of GDL like generality

3. [[Artificial intelligence]]&lt;br&gt;
The notion of [[junction tree]]s has been used to solve many problems in AI. Also the concept of [[bucket elimination]] used many of the concepts.

==The MPF problem==

'''MPF or marginalize a product function''' is a general computational problem which as special case includes many classical problems such as computation of discrete [[Hadamard transform]], [[maximum likelihood decoding]] of a [[linear code]] over a memory-less [[Channel (communications)|channel]], and [[matrix chain multiplication]]. The power of the GDL lies in the fact that it applies to situations in which additions and multiplications are generalized.
A [[commutative semiring]] is a good framework for explaining this behavior. It is defined over a set &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; with operators "&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;" and "&lt;math&gt;.&lt;/math&gt;" where &lt;math&gt;(K,\, +)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(K,\, .)&lt;/math&gt; are a [[commutative monoid]]s and the distributive law holds.

Let &lt;math&gt;p_1, \ldots, p_n&lt;/math&gt; be variables such that &lt;math&gt;p_1 \in A_1, \ldots, p_n \in A_{n}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;A &lt;/math&gt; is a finite set and &lt;math&gt;|A_i| = q_i&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;i = 1,\ldots, n&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;S = \{i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r}\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S \, \subset \{1,\ldots, n\}&lt;/math&gt;, let
&lt;math&gt; A_{S}  = A_{i_1} \times \cdots \times A_{i_r} &lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt; p_{S} = (p_{i_1},\ldots, p_{i_r})&lt;/math&gt;,  
&lt;math&gt; q_{S} = |A_{S}|&lt;/math&gt;, 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A  = A_{1} \times \cdots \times A_{n} &lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf p = \{p_{1}, \ldots, p_{n}\}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;S = \{S_{j}\}_{j=1}^M &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;S_{j} \subset \{1, ...\,,n\}&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose a function is defined as &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{i}: A_{S_{i}} \rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a [[commutative semiring]]. Also, &lt;math&gt; p_{S_{i}}&lt;/math&gt; are named the ''local domains'' and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{i}&lt;/math&gt; as the ''local kernels''.

Now the global kernel &lt;math&gt;\beta : \mathbf A \rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt; is defined as :
&lt;math&gt; \beta(p_{1}, ...\,, p_{n}) = \prod_{i=1}^M \alpha(p_{S_{i}})&lt;/math&gt;

''Definition of MPF problem'': For one or more indices &lt;math&gt;i = 1, ...\,, M&lt;/math&gt;, compute a table of the values of &lt;math&gt;S_{i}&lt;/math&gt;-''marginalization'' of the global kernel &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, which is the function &lt;math&gt;\beta_{i}:A_{S_{i}} \rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt; defined as &lt;math&gt;\beta_{i}(p_{S_{i}}) \, = \displaystyle\sum\limits_{p_{S_{i}^c} \in A_{S_{i}^c}} \beta(p)&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;S_{i}^c&lt;/math&gt; is the complement of &lt;math&gt;S_{i}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf \{1,...\,,n\}&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;\beta_i(p_{S_i})&lt;/math&gt; is called the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; ''objective function'', or the ''objective function'' at &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt;. It can observed that the computation of the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; objective function in the obvious way needs &lt;math&gt;Mq_1 q_2 q_3\cdots q_{n}&lt;/math&gt; operations. This is because there are &lt;math&gt;q_1 q_2\cdots q_n&lt;/math&gt; additions and &lt;math&gt;(M-1)q_1 q_2...q_n&lt;/math&gt; multiplications needed in the computation of the &lt;math&gt;i^\text{th}&lt;/math&gt; objective function. The GDL algorithm which is explained in the next section can reduce this computational complexity.

The following is an example of the MPF problem. 
Let &lt;math&gt;p_{1},\,p_{2},\,p_{3},\,p_{4},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_{5}&lt;/math&gt; be variables such that &lt;math&gt;p_{1} \in A_{1}, p_{2} \in A_{2}, p_{3} \in A_{3}, p_{4} \in A_{4}, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_{5} \in A_{5}&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;M=4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S = \{\{1,2,5\},\{2,4\},\{1,4\}, \{2\}\}&lt;/math&gt;. The given functions using these variables are &lt;math&gt;f(p_{1},p_{2},p_{5})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(p_{3},p_{4})&lt;/math&gt; and we need to calculate &lt;math&gt;\alpha(p_{1}, \, p_{4})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta(p_{2})&lt;/math&gt; defined as:

: &lt;math&gt; \alpha(p_1, \, p_4) =  \displaystyle\sum\limits_{p_2 \in A_2,\, p_3 \in A_3, \, p_5 \in A_5 } f(p_1,\, p_2,\, p_5 ) \cdot g(p_2, \, p_4)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \beta(p_{2}) = \sum\limits_{p_1 \in A_1,\, p_3 \in A_3,\, p_4 \in A_4, \, p_5 \in A_5 } f(p_1, \, p_2, \, p_5) \cdot g(p_2, \, p_4) &lt;/math&gt;

Here local domains and local kernels are defined as follows: 
{|
|-
! local domains !! local kernels
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{5}\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;(f(p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{5})&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{ p_{2}, p_{4}\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;g(p_{2}, p_{4})&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_{1}, p_{4}\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_{2}\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;
|}

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha(p_{1}, p_{4})&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;3^{rd}&lt;/math&gt; objective function and &lt;math&gt;\beta(p_{2})&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;4^{th}&lt;/math&gt; objective function.

Let us consider another example where &lt;math&gt;p_{1},p_{2},p_{3},p_{4},r_{1},r_{2},r_{3},r_{4} \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(r_{1},r_{2},r_{3},r_{4})&lt;/math&gt; is a real valued function. Now, we shall consider the MPF problem where the commutative semiring is defined as the set of real numbers with ordinary addition and multiplication and the local domains and local kernels are defined as follows:

{|
|-
! local domains !! local kernels
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{r_1, r_2, r_3,r_4\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;f(r_1, r_2, r_3,r_4)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{ p_1, r_1\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{p_1 r_1}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_2, r_2\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{p_2 r_2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_3, r_3\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{p_3 r_3}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_4, r_4\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{p_4 r_4}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_1,p_2, p_3, p_4\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Now since the global kernel is defined as the product of the local kernels, it is

: &lt;math&gt;F(p_1, p_2, p_3,p_4, r_1, r_2, r_3,r_4) = f(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4)\cdot(-1)^{p_1r_1 + p_2r_2 + p_3r_3 + p_4r_4}&lt;/math&gt;

and the objective function at the local domain &lt;math&gt;p_1, p_2, p_3,p_4&lt;/math&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt;F(p_1, p_2, p_3,p_4) = \displaystyle\sum \limits_{r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4} f(r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4) \cdot(-1)^{p_1r_1 + p_2r_2 + p_3r_3 + p_4r_4}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the [[Hadamard transform]] of the function &lt;math&gt;f(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence we can see that the computation of [[Hadamard transform]] is a special case of the MPF problem. More examples can be demonstrated to prove that the MPF problem forms special cases of many classical problem as explained above whose details can be found at&lt;ref name=GenDistLaw /&gt;

== GDL: an algorithm for solving the MPF problem ==

If one can find a relationship among the elements of a given set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, then one can solve the MPF problem basing on the notion of [[belief propagation]] which is a special use of "message passing" technique. The required relationship is that the given set of local domains can be organised into a [[junction tree]]. In other words, we create a graph theoretic tree with the elements of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; as the vertices of the [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]] &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, such that for any two arbitrary vertices say &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_{j}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;i \neq j&lt;/math&gt; and there exists an edge between these two vertices, then the intersection of corresponding labels, viz &lt;math&gt;S_{i}\cap S_{j}&lt;/math&gt;, is a subset of the label on each vertex on the unique path from &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v_{j}&lt;/math&gt;.

For example,

Example 1: Consider the following nine local domains:

# &lt;math&gt;\{p_2\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_3,p_2\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_2,p_1\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_3,p_4\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_3\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_1,p_4\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_1\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_4\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_2,p_4\}&lt;/math&gt;

For the above given set of local domains, one can organize them into a junction tree as shown below:

[[File:An example of a junction tree on a given set.png|center|An example of a junction of tree]]

Similarly If another set like the following is given

Example 2: Consider the following four local domains:

# &lt;math&gt;\{p_1,p_2\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_2,p_3\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_3,p_4\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_1,p_4\}&lt;/math&gt;

Then constructing the tree only with these local domains is not possible since this set of values has no common domains which can be placed between any two values of the above set. But however if add the two dummy domains as shown below then organizing the updated set into a junction tree would be possible and easy too.

5.&lt;math&gt;\{p_{1},p_{2}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;p_{4}\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
6.&lt;math&gt;\{p_{2},p_{3}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;p_{4}\}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly for these set of domains, the junction tree looks like shown below:
[[File:Example of junction tree.png|center|Another example of a junction tree]]

===Generalized distributive law (GDL) algorithm===
Input: A set of local domains.&lt;br /&gt;
Output: For the given set of domains, possible minimum number of operations that is required to solve the problem is computed. &lt;br /&gt;
So, if &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_{j}&lt;/math&gt; are connected by an edge in the junction tree, then a message from &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v_{j}&lt;/math&gt; is a set/table of values given by a function: &lt;math&gt;\mu_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;math&gt;A_{S_{i}\cap S_{j}} \rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt;. To begin with all the functions i.e. for all combinations of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; in the given tree, &lt;math&gt;\mu_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be identically &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and when a particular message is update, it follows the equation given below.

: &lt;math&gt;\mu_{i,j}(p_{S_{i}\cap S_{j}})&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\sum_{p_{S_{i}\setminus S_{j}}\in A_{S_{i} \setminus S_{j}}} \alpha _{i} (p_{S_{i}}) \prod_{{v_k \operatorname{adj} v_i},{k \neq j}} \mu_{k,j}(p_{S_k\cap S_i})(1)
 &lt;/math&gt;
    
where &lt;math&gt;v_k \operatorname{adj} v_i&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;v_{k}&lt;/math&gt; is an adjacent vertex to &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; in tree.

Similarly each vertex has a state which is defined as a table containing the values from the function &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{i}: A_{S_{i}} \rightarrow R &lt;/math&gt;, Just like how messages initialize to 1 identically, state of &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be local kernel &lt;math&gt;\alpha(p_{S_{i}})&lt;/math&gt;, but whenever &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{i}&lt;/math&gt; gets updated, it follows the following equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma(p_{S_i})  =   \alpha_i(p_{S_i}) \prod_{v_k \operatorname{adj} v_i}  \mu_{k,j}(p_{S_k\cap S_i})(2).&lt;/math&gt;

===Basic working of the algorithm===
For the given set of local domains as input, we find out if we can create a junction tree, either by using the set directly or by adding dummy domains to the set first and then creating the junction tree, if construction junction is not possible then algorithm output that there is no way to reduce the number of steps to compute the given equation problem, but once we have junction tree, algorithm will have to schedule messages and compute states, by doing these we can know where steps can be reduced, hence will be discusses this below.

== Scheduling of the message passing and the state computation ==

There are two special cases we are going to talk about here namely ''Single Vertex Problem'' in which the objective function is computed at only one vertex &lt;math&gt;v_{0}&lt;/math&gt;  and the second one is ''All Vertices Problem'' where the goal is to compute the objective function at all vertices.

Lets begin with the '''single-vertex problem''', GDL will start by directing each edge towards the targeted vertex &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;. Here messages are sent only in the direction towards the targeted vertex. Note that all the directed messages are sent only once. The messages are started from the leaf nodes(where the degree is 1) go up towards the target vertex &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;. The message travels from the leaves to its parents and then from there to their parents and so on until it reaches the target vertex &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;. The target vertex &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; will compute its state only when it receives all messages from all its neighbors. Once we have the state, We have got the answer and hence the algorithm terminates.

For Example, Lets consider a junction tree constructed from the set of local domains given above i.e. the set from example 1, &lt;br /&gt;Now the Scheduling table for these domains is (where the target vertex is &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt;).

&lt;math&gt;\text{Round                      Message or State Computation} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;1.\mu_{8,4}(p_{4}) = \alpha_{8}(p_{4}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2.\mu_{8,4}(p_{4}) = \Sigma_{p_{2}} \alpha_{9}(p_{2},p_{4}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;3.\mu_{5,2}(p_{3}) = \alpha_{5}(p_{3}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;4.\mu_{6,3}(p_{1}) = \Sigma_{p_{4}} \alpha_{6}(p_{1},p_{4}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;5.\mu_{7,3}(p_{1}) = \alpha_{7}(p_{1}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;6.\mu_{4,2}(p_{3}) = \Sigma_{p_{4}} \alpha_{4}(p_{3},p_{4}).\mu_{8,4}(p_{4}).\mu_{9,4}(p_{4}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;7.\mu_{3,1}(p_{2}) = \Sigma_{p_{1}} \alpha_{3}(p_{2},p_{1}).\mu_{6,3}(p_{1}).\mu_{7,3}(p_{1}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;8.\mu_{2,1}(p_{2}) = \Sigma_{p_{3}} \alpha_{2}(p_{3},p_{2}).\mu_{4,2}(p_{3}).\mu_{5,2}(p_{3}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;9.\sigma_{1}(p_{2}) = \alpha_{1}(p_{2}).\mu_{2,1}(p_{2}).\mu_{3,1}(p_{2})&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the complexity for Single Vertex GDL can be shown as

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{v} d(v)|A_{S_{(v)}}| &lt;/math&gt;  arithmetic operations&lt;br /&gt;
Where (Note: The explanation for the above equation is explained later in the article )&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;S(v)&lt;/math&gt; is the label of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;d(v)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. number of vertices adjacent to v).

To solve the '''All-Vertices''' problem, we can schedule GDL in several ways, some of them are parallel implementation where in each round, every state is updated and every message is computed and transmitted at the same time. In this type of implementation the states and messages will stabilizes after number of rounds that is at most equal to the diameter of the tree. At this point all the all states of the vertices will be equal to the desired objective function.

Another way to schedule GDL for this problem is serial implementation where its similar to the  Single vertex problem except that we don't stop the algorithm until all the vertices of a required set have not got all the messages from all their neighbors and have compute their state. &lt;br /&gt;
Thus the number of arithmetic this implementation requires is at most &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{v \in V} d(v)|A_{S_{(v)}}| &lt;/math&gt; arithmetic operations.

==Constructing a junction tree==

The key to constructing a junction tree lies in the local domain graph &lt;math&gt;G_{LD}&lt;/math&gt;, which is a weighted complete graph with &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; vertices &lt;math&gt;v_1,v_2,v_3,\ldots ,v_M&lt;/math&gt; i.e. one for each local domain, having the weight of the edge  &lt;math&gt;e_{i,j} : v_i \leftrightarrow v_j&lt;/math&gt; defined by&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\omega_{i,j} = |S_{i} \cap S_{j}|&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
if &lt;math&gt;x_{k} \in S_{i} \cap S_{j}&lt;/math&gt;, then we say &lt;math&gt;x_{k}&lt;/math&gt; is contained in&lt;math&gt;e_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt;. Denoted by &lt;math&gt;\omega_{max}&lt;/math&gt; (the weight of a maximal-weight spanning tree of &lt;math&gt;G_{LD}&lt;/math&gt;), which is defined by

: &lt;math&gt;\omega^{*} = \Sigma ^M_{i=1}|S_{i}| - n&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the number of elements in that set. For more clarity and details, please refer to these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ai.stanford.edu/~paskin/gm-short-course/lec3.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319085443/http://ai.stanford.edu/~paskin/gm-short-course/lec3.pdf |archivedate=2015-03-19 |df= }} The Junction Tree Algorithms&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www-anw.cs.umass.edu/~cs691t/SS02/lectures/week7.PDF The Junction Tree Algorithm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scheduling theorem==

Let &lt;math&gt;'T'&lt;/math&gt; be a junction tree with vertex set &lt;math&gt;'V'&lt;/math&gt; and edge set &lt;math&gt;'E'&lt;/math&gt;. In this algorithm, the messages are sent in both the direction on any edge, so we can say/regard the edge set E as set of ordered pairs of vertices. For example, from Figure 1 &lt;math&gt;'E'&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as follows

: &lt;math&gt;E = \{(1,2),(2,1),(1,3),(3,1),(4,2),(2,4),(5,2),(2,5),(6,3),(3,6),(7,3),(3,7),(8,4),(4,8),(9,4),(4,9)\}&lt;/math&gt;

NOTE:&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; above gives you all the possible directions that a message can travel in the tree.

The schedule for the GDL is defined as a finite sequence of subsets of&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. Which is generally represented by 
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} =&lt;/math&gt;{&lt;math&gt;E_{1},E_{2},E_{3},\ldots, E_{N}&lt;/math&gt;}, Where &lt;math&gt;E_{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of messages updated during the &lt;math&gt;N^{th}&lt;/math&gt; round of running the algorithm.

Having defined/seen some notations, we will see want the theorem says,
When we are given a schedule &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} =\{ E_1,E_2,E_3,\ldots, E_N\}&lt;/math&gt;, the corresponding [[Trellis (graph)|message trellis]] as a finite directed graph with Vertex set of  &lt;math&gt;V \times \{0,1,2,3,\ldots, N\}&lt;/math&gt;, in which a typical element is denoted by &lt;math&gt;v_{i}(t)&lt;/math&gt; for  &lt;math&gt;t \in \{0,1,2,3,\ldots,N\}&lt;/math&gt;, Then after completion of the message passing, state at  vertex &lt;math&gt;v_{j}&lt;/math&gt; will be the &lt;math&gt;j^\text{th}&lt;/math&gt; objective defined in

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma(p_{S_i}) = \alpha_i(p_{S_i}) \prod_{v_k \operatorname{adj} v_i}  \mu_{k,j}(p_{S_{k}\cap S_{i}})&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;nowiki&gt;iff&lt;/nowiki&gt; there is a path from &lt;math&gt;v_i(0)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v_j(N)&lt;/math&gt;

== Computational complexity ==

Here we try to explain the complexity of solving the MPF problem in terms of the number of mathematical operations required for the calculation. i.e. We compare the number of operations required when calculated using the normal method (Here by normal method we mean by methods that do not use message passing or junction trees in short methods that do not use the concepts of GDL)and the number of operations using the generalized distributive law.

Example: Let us consider the simplest case where we need to compute the following expression &lt;math&gt;ab+ac&lt;/math&gt;.

To evaluate this expression naively requires two multiplications and one addition. The expression when expressed using the distributive law can be written as &lt;math&gt;a(b+c)&lt;/math&gt; a simple optimization that reduces the number of operations to one addition and one multiplication.

Similar to the above explained example we will be expressing the equations in different forms to perform as few operation as possible by applying the GDL.

As explained in the previous sections we solve the problem by using the concept of the junction trees. The optimization obtained by the use of these trees is comparable to the optimization obtained by solving a semi group problem on trees. For example, to find the minimum of a group of numbers we can observe that if we have a tree and the elements are all at the bottom of the tree, then we can compare the minimum of two items in parallel and the resultant minimum will be written to the parent. When this process is propagated up the tree the minimum of the group of elements will be found at the root.

The following is the complexity for solving the junction tree using message passing

We rewrite the formula used earlier to the following form. This is the eqn for a message to be sent from vertex ''v'' to ''w''

: &lt;math&gt;\mu _{v,w} (p_{v \cap w}) =  \sum _{p _{v \setminus w} \in A _{S(v) \setminus S(w)}} \alpha _{v} (p _{v})  \prod _{u adj v _{u \neq v}} \mu _{u,v} (p _{u \cap v})&lt;/math&gt;            ----message equation
 
Similarly we rewrite the equation for calculating the state of vertex v as follows

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_v(p_v) =  \alpha_v (p_v) \prod_{u \operatorname{adj} v} \mu _{v,w} (p _{v \cap w}) &lt;/math&gt;

We first will analyze for the single-vertex problem and assume the target vertex is &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; and hence we have one edge from &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v _{0}&lt;/math&gt;. 
Suppose we have an edge &lt;math&gt;(v,w)&lt;/math&gt; we calculate the message using the message equation. To calculate &lt;math&gt;p _{u \cap v}&lt;/math&gt; requires

: &lt;math&gt; q _{v \setminus w} -1 &lt;/math&gt;

additions and

: &lt;math&gt; q _{v \setminus w} (d(v)-1)&lt;/math&gt;

multiplications.

(We represent the &lt;math&gt;|A _{S(v) \ S(w)}|&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;q _{v \setminus w}&lt;/math&gt;.)

But there will be many possibilities for &lt;math&gt;x _{v \cap w}&lt;/math&gt; hence &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; q _{v \cap w} \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} | A _{S(v) \cap S(w)}|&lt;/math&gt; possibilities for &lt;math&gt;p _{v \cap w}&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus the entire message will need

: &lt;math&gt; (q _{v \cap w})(q _{v \setminus w} -1)  = q _{v} - q _{v \cap w}&lt;/math&gt;

additions and

: &lt;math&gt; (q _{v \cap w}) q _{v \setminus w}. (d(v) -1) = (d(v) -1) q _v&lt;/math&gt;
multiplications

The total number of arithmetic operations required to send a message towards &lt;math&gt;v_0 &lt;/math&gt;along the edges of tree will be

: &lt;math&gt;\sum _{ v \neq v0} (q_v - q _{v \cap w})&lt;/math&gt;

additions and

: &lt;math&gt; \sum _{ v \neq v0}  (d(v) - 1) q_v&lt;/math&gt;

multiplications.

Once all the messages have been transmitted the algorithm terminates with the computation of state at &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;  The state computation requires &lt;math&gt;d(v_0) q _0&lt;/math&gt; more multiplications.
Thus number of calculations required to calculate the state is given as below

: &lt;math&gt; \sum _{v \neq v _{0}} (q _{v} - q _{v \cap w}) &lt;/math&gt;

additions and

: &lt;math&gt; \sum _{v \neq v _{0}} (d(v) -1) q _{v} + d(v _{0})q _{v _{0}}&lt;/math&gt;

multiplications

Thus the grand total of the number of calculations is

: &lt;math&gt; \chi (T) = \sum _{v \in V} d(v)q _{v} - \sum _{e \in E} q _{e}&lt;/math&gt; ----&lt;math&gt;(1)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e = (v,w)&lt;/math&gt; is an edge and its size is defined by &lt;math&gt;q _{v \cap w}&lt;/math&gt;

The formula above gives us the upper bound.

If we define the complexity of the edge &lt;math&gt;e = (v,w)&lt;/math&gt; as

: &lt;math&gt; \chi (e) = q _{v} + q _{w} - q _{v \cap w} &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;(1)&lt;/math&gt; can be written as

: &lt;math&gt; \chi(T) = \sum _{e \in E} \chi (e)&lt;/math&gt;

We now calculate the edge complexity for the problem defined in Figure 1 as follows

: &lt;math&gt; \chi(1,2) = q_2 + q_2 q_3 - q_2&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(2,4) = q_3 q_4 + q_2 q_3 - q_3&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(2,5) = q_3 + q_2 q_3 - q_3&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(4,8) = q_4 + q_3 q_4 - q_4&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(4,9) = q_2 q_4 + q_3 q_4 - q_4&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(1,3) = q _2 + q_2 q_1 - q_2&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(3,7) = q_1 + q_1 q_2 - q_1&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(3,6) = q_1 q _4 + q _1 q_2 - q _1&lt;/math&gt;

The total complexity will be &lt;math&gt; 3 q _{2}q _{3} + 3q _{3}q _{4}+ 3 q _{1}q _{2}+q _{2}q _{4} + q _{1}q _{4} - q _{1} - q _{3} - q _{4}&lt;/math&gt; which is considerably low compared to the direct method. (Here by direct method we mean by methods that do not use message passing. The time taken using the direct method will be the equivalent to calculating message at each node and time to calculate the state of each of the nodes.)

Now we consider the all-vertex problem where the message will have to be sent in both the directions and state must be computed at both the vertexes. This would take &lt;math&gt; O( \sum _{v} d(v) d(v) q _{v}) &lt;/math&gt; but by precomputing we can reduce the number of multiplications to &lt;math&gt;3(d-2)&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the degree of the vertex. Ex : If there is a set &lt;math&gt;(a _{1}, \ldots ,a _{d})&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; numbers. It is possible to compute all the d products of &lt;math&gt;d-1&lt;/math&gt; of the &lt;math&gt; a _{i}&lt;/math&gt; with at most &lt;math&gt;3(d-2)&lt;/math&gt; multiplications rather than the obvious &lt;math&gt; d(d-2) &lt;/math&gt;. 
We do this by precomputing the quantities 
&lt;math&gt;b_1 = a_1, b_2= b_1 \cdot a_2 = a_1 \cdot a _2, b _{d-1} = b _{d-2} \cdot a_{d-1} = a_1 a_2 \cdots a_{d-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_d = a_d, c_{d-1} = a_{d-1} c_d = a _{d-1} \cdot a_d, \ldots , c_2 = a _2 \cdot c_3 = a _2 a_3 \cdots a_d&lt;/math&gt; this takes &lt;math&gt; 2 (d-2)&lt;/math&gt; multiplications. Then if &lt;math&gt; m_j&lt;/math&gt; denotes the product of all &lt;math&gt; a_i&lt;/math&gt; except for &lt;math&gt; a_j&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt; m_1 = c_2, m_2 = b_1 \cdot c_3&lt;/math&gt; and so on will need another &lt;math&gt;d-2&lt;/math&gt; multiplications making the total &lt;math&gt; 3 (d-2)&lt;/math&gt;

There is not much we can do when it comes to the construction of the junction tree except that we may have many maximal weight spanning tree and we should choose the spanning tree with the least &lt;math&gt;\chi(T)&lt;/math&gt; and sometimes this might mean adding a local domain to lower the junction tree complexity.

It may seem that GDL is correct only when the local domains can be expressed as a junction tree. But even in cases where there are cycles and a number of iterations the messages will approximately be equal to the objective function. The experiments on Gallager–Tanner–Wiberg algorithm for low density parity-check codes were supportive of this claim.

'''Glitch art''' is the practice of using digital or analog errors for aesthetic purposes by either corrupting digital data or physically manipulating electronic devices. Glitches appear in visual art such as the film ''A Colour Box'' (1935) by [[Len Lye]], the video sculpture ''TV Magnet'' (1965) by [[Nam June Paik]] and more contemporary work such as ''Panasonic TH-42PWD8UK Plasma Screen Burn'' (2007) by [[Cory Arcangel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Menkman | first = Rosa | author-link = Rosa Menkman | contribution = Glitch Studies Manifesto | editor1-last = Lovink | editor1-first = Geert | editor2-last = Somers-Miles | editor2-first = Rachel | title = Video Vortex Reader II: Moving Images Beyond YouTube | volume =  | pages = 336–347 | publisher = Institute of Network Cultures | place = Amsterdam | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-90-78146-12-4 | contribution-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110827222833/http://www.networkcultures.org/_uploads/%236reader_VideoVortex2PDF.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the term ==

In a technical sense, a [[glitch]] is the unexpected result of a malfunction, especially occurring in software, video games, images, videos, audio, and other digital artefacts. Early examples of glitches used in [[new media art|media art]] include ''Digital TV Dinner'' (1978) created by Jamie Fenton and Raul Zaritsky, with glitch audio done by Dick Ainsworth. This video was made by manipulating the [[Bally Astrocade|Bally video game console]] and recording the results on videotape.&lt;ref name=betancourt&gt;Betancourt, Michael. (2015) [http://www.michaelbetancourt.com/pdf/Betancourt_TheInventionofGlitchVideo.pdf The Invention of Glitch Video: Digital TV Dinner (1978) (preview)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term glitch came to be associated with music in the mid 90s to describe a genre of experimental/noise/electronica (see [[Glitch (music)|glitch music]]). Shortly after, as VJs and other visual artist began to embrace the glitch as an aesthetic of the digital age, glitch art came to refer to a whole assembly of visual arts.&lt;ref&gt;Betancourt, Michael. (2003) "Welcome to Cyberia" [http://www.michaelbetancourt.com/pdf/MAEX_Welcome_to_Cyberia_2003.pdf], ''Miami Art Exchange,'' September 19, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2002, Motherboard, a tech-art collective, held a glitch symposium in [[Oslo]], Norway, to "bring together international artists, academics and other Glitch practitioners for a short space of time to share their work and ideas with the public and with each other."&lt;ref&gt;Motherboard. (2002) http://www.liveart.org/motherboard/&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29 thru October 3, 2010, [[Chicago]] played host to the first GLI.TC/H, a five-day conference in Chicago organized by Nick Briz, Evan Meaney, [[Rosa Menkman]] and Jon Satrom that included workshops, lectures, performances, installations and screenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = McCormack| first = Tom| title = Code Eroded: At GLI.TC/H| work = Rhizome| accessdate = 2016-08-25| date = 2010-10-13| url = http://rhizome.org/editorial/2010/oct/13/code-eroded-at-glitch/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, the second GLI.TC/H event traveled from [[Chicago]] to [[Amsterdam]] and lastly to [[Birmingham]], UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecreatorsproject.com/blog/chicagos-glitch-fest-disrupts-the-traditional-gallery-space The Creators Project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229055113/http://thecreatorsproject.com/blog/chicagos-glitch-fest-disrupts-the-traditional-gallery-space |date=February 29, 2012 }}.

What is called "glitch art" typically means visual glitches, either in a still or moving image. It is made by either "capturing" an image of a glitch as it randomly happens, or more often by artists/designers manipulating their digital files, software or hardware to produce these "errors." Artists have posted a variety of tutorials online explaining how to make glitch art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://danieltemkin.com/Tutorials Daniel Temkin, "Glitch Tutorials," DanielTemkin.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://phillipstearns.wordpress.com/glitch-art-resources/ Phillip Stearns, "Glitch Art Resources," phillipstearns.wordpress.com]&lt;/ref&gt; There are many approaches to making these glitches happen on demand, ranging from physical changes to the hardware to direct alternations of the digital files themselves. Artist [[Michael Betancourt]] identified five areas of manipulation that are used to create "glitchart."&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Betancourt]], "Glitch Art in Theory and Practice," Cinegraphic.net May 20, 2016 [http://www.cinegraphic.net/article.php?story=20160520143014412]&lt;/ref&gt; Betancourt notes that "glitch art" is defined by a broad range of technical approaches that can be identified with changes made to the digital file, its generative display, or the technologies used to show it (such as a video screen). He includes within this range changes made to analog technologies such as television (in video art) or the physical film strip in motion pictures:

===Data manipulation===
[[File:My first datamosh.webm|thumb|right|200px|An example of datamoshing]]
Data manipulation  (aka ''[[databending]]'') changes the information inside the digital file to create glitches. Databending involves editing and changing the file data. There are a variety of tutorials explaining how to make these changes using programs such as HexFiend.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Betancourt]], "An Easy 7-Step Protocol for Databending," ''Signal Culture Cookbook,'' 2014 [http://www.michaelbetancourt.com/pdf/Cookbook_Databending.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Woodall explains in his tutorial
&lt;blockquote&gt;Like all files, image files (.jpg .bmp .gif etc) are all made up of text. Unlike some other files, like .svg (vectors) or .html (web pages), when an image is opened in a text editor all that comes up is gobbldygook!&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fizzpop.org.uk/an-introduction-to-databending/ Adam Woodall, "An introduction to databending ," FizzPop, May 15, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Related processes such as '''datamoshing''' changes the data in a video or picture file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Datamoshing Technique for Video Art Production|journal=芸術科学会論文誌 - The Journal of The Society for Art and Science|volume=13|url=http://www.art-science.org/journal/v13n3/v13n3pp154/artsci-v13n3pp154.pdf|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flossmanuals"/&gt;  Datamoshing with software such as [[Avidemux]] is a common method for creating glitch art by manipulating different frame types in compressed digital video: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Datamoshing involves the removal of an encoded video’s I-frames (intra-coded picture, also known as key frames—a frame that does not require any information regarding another frame to be decoded), leaving only the P- (predicted picture) or B- (bi-predictive picture) frames. P-frames contain information predicting the changes in the image between the current frame and the previous one, and B-frames contain information predicting the image differences between the previous, current and subsequent frames. Because P- and B-frames use data from previous and forward frames, they are more compressed than I-Frames."&lt;ref&gt;Zinman, Gregory (2015). ‘Getting Messy: Chance and Glitch in Contemporary Video Art,’ in Abstract Video: The Moving Image in Contemporary Art, edited by Gabrielle Jennings. Oakland: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This process of direct manipulation of the digital data is not restricted to files that only appear on digital screens. "3D model glitching" refers to the purposeful corruption of the code in [[List of 3D animation software|3D animation program]]s resulting in distorted and abstract images of 3D [[virtual world]]s, [[3D modeling|models]] and even [[3D printing|3D printed objects]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turk|first1=Victoria|title=3D-Printed Mistakes Are Inspiring a New Kind of Glitch Art|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/read/3d-printed-mistakes-are-inspiring-a-new-kind-of-glitch-art|publisher=Vice Motherboard|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misalignment===
Misalignment glitches are produced by opening a digital file of one type with a program designed for a different type of file,&lt;ref name="flossmanuals"&gt;{{cite web|title=Encoding Explained|url=https://flossmanuals.net/a-look-at-open-video/encoding-explained/|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as opening a video file as a sound file, or using the wrong codec to decompress a file.  Tools commonly used to create glitches of this type include [[Audacity (audio editor)|Audacity]] and [[WordPad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=databending and glitch art primer, part 1: the wordpad effect|url=http://blog.animalswithinanimals.com/2008/08/databending-and-glitch-art-primer-part.html|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artist Jamie Boulton explains the process and the glitches it produces, noting that these glitches depend on how Audacity handles files, even when they are not audio-encoded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The easiest way to manipulate a file in Audacity is to select a section of the file and apply one of the built in sound effects to it. Now I’m no computing whizz kid but the way I see it when you apply a sound effect to a sound file, the program takes that file and alters the file data in the manner which it’s been told will achieve that effect. So, for example, if you were to apply an echo effect then it would repeat parts of the file, diminishing the repetition after each iteration. The wonderful thing is that it will do this regardless of what the file actually is. Audacity doesn’t know or care whether the file is a sound or not, it will alter it in the manner instructed.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Boulton, "Databending using Audacity Effects," Question Something, July 26, 2012 [https://questionsomething.wordpress.com/2012/07/26/databending-using-audacity-effects/]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Hardware failure===
Hardware failure happens by altering the physical wiring or other internal connections of the machine itself, such as a short-circuit, in a process called "[[circuit bending]]" causes the machine to create glitches that produce new sounds and visuals.&lt;ref name=wired1&gt;{{cite web|title=Glitch art created by 'databending'|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/glitch-art-databending|work=Wired|first=Duncan |last= Geere |accessdate=19 July 2016|date=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, by damaging internal pieces of something like a [[VHS]] player, one can achieve different colorful visual images. Video artist [[Tom DeFanti]] explained the role of hardware failure in a voice-over for Jamie Fenton's early glitch video ''Digital TV Dinner'' that used the [[Bally Astrocade|Bally video game console]] system:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This piece represents the absolute cheapest one can go in home computer art. This involves taking a $300 video game system, pounding it with your fist so the cartridge pops out while its trying to write the menu.  The music here is done by Dick Ainsworth using the same system, but pounding it with your fingers instead of your fist.&lt;ref name=betancourt/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Physically beating the case of the game system would cause the game cartridge to pop out, interrupting the computer's operation. The glitches that resulted from this failure were a result of how the machine was set-up:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There was ROM memory in the cartridge and ROM memory built into the console. Popping out the cartridge while executing code in the console ROM created garbage references in the stack frames and invalid pointers, which caused the strange patterns to be drawn. [...] The Bally Astrocade was unique among cartridge games in that it was designed to allow users to change game cartridges with power-on. When pressing the reset button, it was possible to remove the cartridge from the system and induce various memory dump pattern sequences. Digital TV Dinner is a collection of these curious states of silicon epilepsy set to music composed and generated upon this same platform.&lt;ref name=betancourt/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Misregistration===
Misregistration is produced by the physical noise of historically analog media such as motion picture film. It includes dirt, scratches, smudges and markings that can distort physical media also impact the playback of digital recordings on media such as CDs and DVDs, as electronic music composer [[Kim Cascone]] explained in 2002:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"There are many types of digital audio ‘failure.' Sometimes, it results in horrible noise, while other times it can produce wondrous tapestries of sound. (To more adventurous ears, these are quite often the same.) When the German sound experimenters known as Oval started creating music in the early 1990s by painting small images on the underside of CDs to make them skip, they were using an aspect of ‘failure' in their work that revealed a subtextual layer embedded in the compact disc.

Oval's investigation of ‘failure' is not new. Much work had previously been done in this area such as the optical soundtrack work of Laszlo Moholy-Nagy and Oskar Fischinger, as well as the vinyl record manipulations of John Cage and Christian Marclay, to name a few. What is new is that ideas now travel at the speed of light and can spawn entire musical genres in a relatively short period of time."&lt;ref name=Cascone1&gt;{{cite web|title=THE AESTHETICS OF FAILURE 'Post-Digital' Tendencies in Contemporary Computer Music|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/journals/COMJ/CMJ24_4Cascone.pdf|work=''Computer Music Journal,'' 24:4 Winter 2002 (MIT Press)|first=Kim |last=Cascone | author-link = Kim_Cascone |accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Distortion===
Distortion was one of the earliest types of glitch art to be produced, such as in the work of video artist [[Nam June Paik]], who created video distortions by placing powerful magnets in close proximity to the television screen, resulting in the appearance of abstract patterns.&lt;ref name=Keys1&gt;{{cite web|title=Error Message|url=http://www.richardbkeys.net/error-message/|first=Richard B. |last=Keys |accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paik's addition of physical interference to a TV set created new kinds of imagery that changed how the broadcast image was displayed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The magnetic field interferes with the television’s electronic signals, distorting the broadcast image into an abstract form that changes when the magnet is moved.&lt;ref&gt;"Nam June Paik: TV Magnet," Whitney Museum of American Art, web description for accession number 86.60a-b [http://collection.whitney.org/object/6139]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By recording the resulting distortions with a camera, they can then be shown without the need for the magnet.

{{Emotion}}

'''Guilt''' is a [[cognitive]] or an [[emotion]]al experience that occurs when a person [[belief|believes]] or [[understanding|realizes]]—accurately or not—that they have compromised their own standards of conduct or have violated a universal [[Morality|moral]] standard and bear significant [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] for that violation.&lt;ref&gt;

Guilt is “an emotional state produced by thoughts that we have not lived up to our ideal self and could have done otherwise.”' Retrieved 2017-12-03.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Guilt is closely related to the concept of [[remorse]].

==Psychology==
Guilt is an important factor in perpetuating [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Leslie J. Shapiro, LICSW |url=https://www.aacp.com/Abstract.asp?AID=9322&amp;issue=February%202011&amp;page=C&amp;UID= |title=Pathological guilt: A persistent yet overlooked treatment factor in obsessive-compulsive disorder — |publisher=Aacp.com |accessdate=27 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201040951/https://www.aacp.com/Abstract.asp?AID=9322&amp;issue=February%202011&amp;page=C&amp;UID= |archivedate=1 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guilt and its associated causes, merits, and demerits are common themes in [[psychology]] and [[psychiatry]]. Both in specialized and in ordinary language, guilt is an affective state in which one experiences conflict at having done something that one believes one should not have done (or conversely, having not done something one believes one should have done). It gives rise to a feeling which does not go away easily, driven by '[[conscience]]'. [[Sigmund Freud]] described this as the result of a struggle between the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]] and the [[superego]]&amp;nbsp;– parental imprinting. Freud rejected the role of [[God]] as punisher in times of illness or rewarder in time of wellness. While removing one source of guilt from patients, he described another. This was the unconscious force within the individual that contributed to illness, Freud in fact coming to consider "the obstacle of an unconscious sense of guilt...as the most powerful of all obstacles to recovery."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) pp. 390–1&lt;/ref&gt; For his later explicator, [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], guilt was the inevitable companion of the signifying subject who acknowledged normality in the form of [[the Symbolic]] order.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catherine Belsey]], ''Shakespeare in Theory and Practice'' (2008) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alice Miller (psychologist)|Alice Miller]] claims that "many people suffer all their lives from this oppressive feeling of guilt, the sense of not having lived up to their parents' expectations....no argument can overcome these guilt feelings, for they have their beginnings in life's earliest period, and from that they derive their intensity."&lt;ref&gt;Alice Miller, ''The Drama of Being a Child'' (1995) pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; This may be linked to what Les Parrott has called "the disease of false guilt....At the root of false guilt is the idea that what you ''feel'' must be true."&lt;ref&gt;Parrott, pp. 158–9&lt;/ref&gt; If you ''feel'' guilty, you must ''be'' guilty!

The philosopher [[Martin Buber]] underlined the difference between the [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] notion of guilt, based on internal conflicts, and ''existential guilt'', based on actual harm done to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Buber, M. |title=Guilt and guilt feelings |journal=Psychiatry |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=114–29 |date=May 1957 |pmid=13441838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilt is often associated with [[anxiety]]. In [[mania]], according to [[Otto Fenichel]], the patient succeeds in applying to guilt "the defense mechanism of denial by overcompensation...re-enacts being a person without guilt feelings."&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) pp. 409–10&lt;/ref&gt;

In psychological research, guilt can be measured by using questionnaires, such as the [[Discrete emotion theory|Differential Emotions Scale]] (Izard's DES), or the [[Dutch Guilt Measurement Instrument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author=Van Laarhoven, H et al. | title=Comparison of attitudes of guilt and forgiveness in cancer patients without evidence of disease and advanced cancer patients in a palliative care setting |journal=Cancer Nursing |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=483-492 |date=November–December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defenses===
Defenses against feeling guilt can become an overriding aspect of one's personality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]] ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;  The methods that can be used to avoid guilt are multiple.  They include:
#[[Psychological repression|Repression]], usually used by the [[superego]] and ego against instinctive impulses, but on occasion employed against the superego/conscience itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11)p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;  If the defence fails, then (in a return of the repressed) one may begin to feel guilty years later for actions lightly committed at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (Penguin 1976) p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Psychological projection|Projection]] is another defensive tool with wide applications. It may take the form of [[blaming the victim]]: The victim of someone else's accident or bad luck may be offered criticism, the theory being that the victim may be at fault for having attracted the other person's hostility.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pursuit of Health'', June Bingham &amp; Norman Tamarkin, M.D., Walker Press&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, not the guilt, but the condemning agency itself, may be projected onto other people, in the hope that they will look upon one's deeds more favorably than one's own conscience  (a process that verges on [[Ideas of reference and delusions of reference|ideas of reference]]).&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 165 and p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;
#Sharing a feeling of guilt, and thereby being less alone with it, is a motive force in both art and joke-telling; while it is also possible to "borrow" a sense of guilt from someone who is seen as in the wrong, and thereby assuage one's own.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 165-6 and p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;
#Self-harm may be used as an alternative to compensating the object of one's transgression – perhaps in the form of not allowing oneself to enjoy opportunities open to one, or benefits due, as a result of uncompensated guilt feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nelissen | first1 = R.

=== Behavioral responses ===
Feelings of guilt can prompt subsequent virtuous behavior. People who feel guilty may be more likely to exercise restraint,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guilty pleasures and grim necessities: Affective attitudes in dilemmas of self-control.|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/80/2/206/|website = APA PsycNET|accessdate = 2015-10-13|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; avoid self-indulgence,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The effects of nonconsciously priming emotion concepts on behavior.|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/93/6/927/|website = APA PsycNET|accessdate = 2015-10-13|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and exhibit less prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Dynamic Model of Guilt Implications for Motivation and Self-Regulation in the Context of Prejudice|url = http://pss.sagepub.com/content/18/6/524|journal = Psychological Science|date = 2007-06-01|issn = 0956-7976|pmid = 17576266|pages = 524–530|volume = 18|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01933.x|language = en|first = David M.|last = Amodio|first2 = Patricia G.|last2 = Devine|first3 = Eddie|last3 = Harmon-Jones|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161205085614/http://pss.sagepub.com/content/18/6/524|archivedate = 5 December 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guilt appears to prompt reparatory behaviors to alleviate the negative emotions that it engenders.

===Lack of guilt in psychopaths===
Individuals high in [[psychopathy]] lack any true sense of guilt or [[remorse]] for harm they may have caused others. Instead, they [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalize]] their behavior, [[blame]] someone else, or [[Denial|deny]] it outright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Birket-Smith, Morten |author2=Millon, Theodore |author3=Simonsen, Erik |author4=Davis, Roger E. |chapter=11.

They have little ability to plan ahead for the future. An individual with psychopathy will never find themselves at fault because they will do whatever it takes to benefit themselves without reservation. A person that does not feel guilt or remorse would have no reason to find themselves at fault for something that they did with the intention of hurting another person. To a person high in psychopathy, their actions can always be rationalized to be the fault of another person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Neumann |first=Craig S. |author2=Kosson, David S. |author3=Forth, Adelle E. |author4=Hare, Robert D. |title=Factor structure of the Hare Psychopathy Checklist: Youth Version (PCL:YV) in adolescent females|journal=Psychological Assessment|year=2013|doi=10.1037/1040-3590.18.2.142 |volume=18 |pages=142–154}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen by psychologists as part of a lack of moral reasoning (in comparison with the majority of humans), an inability to evaluate situations in a moral framework, and an inability to develop emotional bonds with other people due to a lack of [[empathy]].

===Causes===

====Evolutionary theories====
Some evolutionary psychologists theorize that guilt and [[shame]] helped maintain beneficial relationships, such as [[reciprocal altruism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pallanti, S., Quercioli, L. |title=Shame and psychopathology |journal=CNS Spectr |volume=5 |issue=8 |pages=28–43 |date=August 2000 |pmid=18192938}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person feels guilty when he harms another, or even fails to reciprocate kindness, he is more likely not to harm others or become too selfish. In this way, he reduces the chances of retaliation by members of his tribe, and thereby increases his survival prospects, and those of the tribe or group. As with any other emotion, guilt can be [[Psychological manipulation|manipulated]] to control or influence others. As highly social animals living in large, relatively stable groups, humans need ways to deal with conflicts and events in which they inadvertently or purposefully harm others. If someone causes harm to another, and then feels guilt and demonstrates regret and sorrow, the person harmed is likely to forgive. Thus, guilt makes it possible to forgive, and helps hold the social group together.

====Social psychology theories====
When we see another person suffering, it can also cause us pain. This constitutes our powerful system of empathy, which leads to our thinking that we should do something to relieve the suffering of others. If we cannot help another, or fail in our efforts, we experience feelings of guilt. From the perspective of group selection, groups that are made up of a high percentage of co-operators outdo groups with a low percentage of co-operators in between-group competition. People who are more prone to high levels of empathy-based guilt may be likely to suffer from anxiety and depression; however, they are also more likely to cooperate and behave altruistically. This suggests that guilt-proneness may not always be beneficial at the level of the individual, or within-group competition, but highly beneficial in between-group competition.{{Citation needed|reason=cf. Dearing, et al. in Addictive Behaviors Vol 30.7 for conflicting research.|date=December 2008}}

====Other theories====
Another common notion is that guilt is assigned by social processes, such as a [[jury trial]] (i. e., that it is a strictly legal concept). Thus, the ruling of a jury that [[O. J. Simpson]] or [[Julius Rosenberg]] was "guilty" or "not innocent" is taken as an actual judgment by the whole society that they must act as if they were so. By corollary, the ruling that such a person is "not guilty" may not be so taken, due to the asymmetry in the assumption that one is [[Presumption of innocence|assumed innocent until proven guilty]], and prefers to take the [[risk]] of freeing a guilty party over convicting innocents. Still others—often, but not always, theists of one type or another—believe that the origin of guilt comes from violating universal principles of right and wrong. In most instances, people who believe this also acknowledge that even though there is proper guilt from doing 'wrong' instead of doing 'right', people endure all sorts of guilty feelings which do not stem from violating universal moral principles.

==Collective guilt==

{{main|Collective responsibility}}
Collective guilt (or group guilt) is the unpleasant and often emotional reaction that results among a group of individuals when it is perceived that the group illegitimately harmed members of another group. It is often the result of “sharing a social identity with others whose actions represent a threat to the positivity of that identity.” For an individual to experience collective guilt, he must identify himself as a part of the in-group. “This produces a perceptual shift from thinking of oneself in terms of ‘I’ and ‘me’ to ‘us’ or ‘we’.”&lt;ref name="Collective"&gt;{{cite book |last=Branscombe |first=Nyla, R. |author2=Bertjan Doosje |year=2004
|title=Collective Guilt: International Perspectives |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-52083-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-guilt==

Feeling guilt for one's own actions. This doesn't mean that you feel guilty for your own actions all the time, you can feel self-guilt even if someone else did something. Self-guilt can often lead to [[depression (mood)]] and worst-case scenarios.

===Self-guilt in relationships===
While dealing with self-guilt, there's even more stuff you need to deal with. Self-guilt can mentally eat up a person while they're in a relationship, making them feel [[guilt]] on one's ownself. This can occur due to many things, one of them in insecurties. Feeling insecure can lead to self-guilt, feeling like it's one's own fault for feeling that way. This can often feel stressful, causing mental-break downs, problems in the relationship, and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name="tinybuddha"&gt;[https://tinybuddha.com/topic/self-guilt-might-ruin-my-relationship-need-to-make-a-solid-change/&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Self-guilt &amp; Self-harm===
Self-guilt is a feeling many people who self-harm get. Self-guilt is almost like mentally self-harming to one's ownself, except it's in the mind. People who self-harm often feel it's their fault for doing it, which makes them feel ashamed. Harming yourself is often felt like it's your own fault, giving the feeling of ''self-guilt''. &lt;ref name="self-harm and self-guilt"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/1367493507082759| pmid=18039732|title = Guilt and shame: Experiences of parents of self-harming adolescents| journal=Journal of Child Health Care| volume=11| issue=4| pages=298–310|year = 2007|last1 = McDonald|first1 = Glenda| last2=O'Brien| first2=Louise| last3=Jackson| first3=Debra}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Self-guilt &amp; Depression===
[[Depression (mood)|Depression]] is often related to self-guilt. Constant feeling of self-guilt can lead to depression, since an individual is constantly putting themselves down. Self-guilt sparks insecurity, indecision, and poor decisions. &lt;ref name="depression"&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://psychcentral.com/blog/overcoming-guilt-in-depression/ | title=Overcoming Guilt in Depression| date=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural views==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}
Traditional [[Culture of Japan|Japanese society]], [[Korean society]] and [[Chinese culture]]&lt;ref&gt;Bill Brugger, ''China, Liberation and Transformation'' (1981) pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes said to be "[[shame]]-based" rather than "guilt-based", in that the social consequences of "getting caught" are seen as more important than the individual feelings or experiences of the agent (see the work of [[Ruth Benedict]]). The same has been said of [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek society]], a culture where, in [[Bruno Snell]]'s words, if "honour is destroyed the moral existence of the loser collapses."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in M. I. Finley, ''The World of Odysseus'' (1967) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

This may lead to more of a focus on [[etiquette]] than on [[ethics]] as understood in Western civilization, leading some{{who|date=April 2012}} in Western civilizations to question why the word ''[[ethos]]'' was adapted from [[Ancient Greek]] with such vast differences in cultural norms. [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] inherit most notions of guilt from [[Judaism]]{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}, [[Ancient Persia|Persia]]n, and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ideas, mostly as interpreted through [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], who adapted [[Plato]]'s ideas to Christianity. The [[Latin]] word for guilt is ''culpa'', a word sometimes seen in law literature, for instance in ''mea culpa'' meaning "my fault (guilt)".

===Etymology===
Guilt, from [[Old English|O.E.]] ''gylt'' "crime, sin, fault, fine, debt", derived from O.E. ''gieldan'' "to pay for, debt". The mistaken use for "sense of guilt" is first recorded in 1690. "Guilt by association" is first recorded in 1941. "Guilty" is from O.E. ''gyltig'', from ''gylt''.

===In literature===
Guilt is a main theme in [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'', [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', Tennessee Williams' ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Macbeth]]'', [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]" and "[[The Black Cat (short story)|The Black Cat]]", and many other works of literature. In Sartre's ''[[The Flies]]'', the Furies (in the form of flies) represent the morbid, strangling forces of neurotic guilt which bind us to authoritarian and totalitarian power.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fagles trans., ''The Oresteia'' (Penguin 1981) p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilt is a major theme in many works by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], and is an almost universal concern of novelists who explore inner [[life]] and [[secret]]s.

===In the Christian Bible===
Guilt in the Christian [[Bible]] is not merely an emotional state but is a legal state of deserving punishment. The [[Hebrew Bible]] does not have a unique word for guilt, but uses a single word to signify: "sin, the guilt of it, the punishment due unto it, and a sacrifice for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Owen, J. |chapter=Chapter 8|title=The Doctrine of Justification by Faith |publisher=Johnstone and Hunter |location=London |year=1850 |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek [[New Testament]] uses a word for guilt that means "standing exposed to judgment for sin" (e. g., [[Romans 3]]:19). In what Christians call the "[[Old Testament]]", Christians believe the Bible teaches that, through sacrifice, one's sins can be forgiven (Judaism categorically rejects this idea, holding that forgiveness of sin is exclusively through repentance, and the role of sacrifices was for atonement of sins committed by accident or ignorance [http://www.shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/11-08-02.html]). The New Testament says that this forgiveness is given as written in 1 Corinthians 15:3–4: "3 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, for that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures." Some believe that the Old and New Testaments have differing opinions on the expiation of guilt because the Old Testaments were subject to the Age of Law and the New Testaments replace the Age of Law with the now current Age of Grace. However, both in the Old Testament and the New Testament salvation was granted based on God's grace and forgiveness (Gen 6:8; 19:19; Exo 33:12–17; 34:6–7). Animal sacrifices were only a symbol of the future sacrifice of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] (Heb 10:1–4; 9–12). The whole world is guilty before God for abandoning him and his ways (Rom 3:19). In Jesus Christ, God took upon himself the sins of the world and died on the cross to pay our debt (Rom 6:23). Those who repent and accept the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for their sins, will be redeemed by God and thus not guilty before him. They will be granted eternal life which will take effect when Jesus comes the second time (1 Thess 4:13–18). In contrast to surrounding nations which addressed their guilt with human sacrifice, the Israeli authors of the Bible called that an abomination (1 Kings 11:7, Jer 32:35). The Bible agrees with pagan cultures that guilt creates a cost that someone must pay (Heb 9:22). (This assumption was expressed in the previous section, "Defences": "Guilty people punish themselves if they have no opportunity to compensate the transgression that caused them to feel guilty. It was found that self-punishment did not occur if people had an opportunity to compensate the victim of their transgression.") But unlike pagan deities who demanded it be paid by humans, God, according to the Bible, loved us enough to pay it Himself, as a good father would, while calling us His "children" and calling Himself our "father" (Mat 5:45).

'''''Ḥayy ibn Yaqẓān''''' (''[[arabic|ar.]]'' حي بن يقظان ''Alive, son of Awake'') is an [[Arabic]] [[philosophical novel]] and an [[allegorical]] tale written by [[Ibn Tufail]] in the early 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199917389.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199917389-e-35 | title=The Oxford Handbook of Islamic Philosophy | chapter=Ibn Ṭufayl’s (d. 1185) Ḥayy ibn Yaqẓan | first=Taneli | last=Kukkonen | editor-first1=Khaled | editor-last1=El-Rouayheb | editor-first2=Sabine | editor-last2=Schmidtke | date=November 2016 | accessdate=2 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also known as (''[[latin|lat.]]'') '''Philosophus Autodidactus''' ''The Self-Taught Philosopher'' and as (''[[English language|en.]]'') ''The Improvement of Human Reason: Exhibited in the Life of Hai Ebn Yokdhan''.

== Plot ==
The story revolves around Ḥayy ibn Yaqẓān, a little boy who grew up on an island in the Indies under the equator, isolated from the people, in the bosom of an antelope that raised him feeding him with her milk.

Ḥayy has just learned to walk: imitating the sounds of antelopes, birds and other animals in his surrounding, he learns the languages of the animals around him; and he learns to guide himself to the actions of animals by imitating their instinct.

He makes his own shoes and clothes from the skins of the animal, studies the stars, till he reaches a higher level of knowledge of the finest of astrologist. His continuous explorations and observation of creatures and environment led him to gain great knowledge in natural science, philosophy and religion.

He will conclude that, at the basis of the creation of the universe, a great creator must  exist.

Ḥayy ibn Yaqẓān lived a humble modest life as [[Sufism|Sufi]] and forbade himself from eating meat. 
Once thirty years old, he met the first human, landed on his isolated Island.

By the age of forty-nine years, he will be ready to teach other people about the knowledge he gained throughout his life.

==Background==
[[File:I.am.a.curator.13.11.03.jpg|thumb|right|''Installation view from I am a Curator''&lt;br&gt;Chisenhale Gallery, 13 November 2003, Muller Kneer Associates]]

Hüttner carried out a series of exhibitions that democratized or investigated the curatorial process in the late 1990s and in the early years of the new millennium.&lt;ref&gt;A Tasty Treat, James Westcott, [[Zingmagazine]] 18; p.270-272; 2003; New York, United States&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these were collaborative and took place at the Gallery [[Konstakuten]] in Stockholm, [[The Hood Gallery]] in Los Angeles but also in galleries and public spaces in London, New York City and [[Vancouver]] and involved artists from different generations and included [[Geoffrey Farmer]], [[Brian Jungen]], [[Lenke Rothman]], [[Neil Goldstein]] and curators like [[Reid Shier]] and [[Tone O Nielsen]].&lt;ref&gt;Amelie Nordenfelt, ''Introduction", ''Curatorial Mutiny'', p. 9, edited by Per Hüttner, 2003, 120 pages, texts by: Per Hüttner, Amelie Nordenfelt, Gavin wade, Tone O. Nielsen, Drabble+Sachs, Claire Canning and Tone Hansen. Design by Voodoo Graphics and Jonas Lindén. Published by Föreningen Curatorial MutinyStockholm, 2003. {{ISBN|91-631-3247-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 he created the curatorial framework for an exhibition at [[Nylon (gallery)|Nylon]] in collaboration with [[Goshka Macuga]] and [[Gavin Wade]].&lt;ref&gt;Neal Brown, [http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/3_in_1_curatorial_mutiny_part_4/ ''3 in 1 Curatorial Mutiny, Part 4'', ''Frieze'', Issue 60, June – August 2001.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203192526/http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/3_in_1_curatorial_mutiny_part_4/ |date=3 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2002 at Curatorial Market at [[Cuchifritos]] and various public venues including [[Essex Street Market]] in New York. In these projects he developed ideas and practices that pointed towards a new way of relating to the art object and exhibition making that eventually became manifest in I am a Curator.:&lt;ref&gt;A Tasty Treat, James Westcott, Zingmagazine 18; p.270-272; 2003; New York City&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Despite its populist ideals, the Curatorial Market raises complex, insider issues about the relationship between artist and curator. ‘These two disciplines are beginning to mix and merge in ways that some people find appalling and others see as a powerful new development in the history of art making,’ [[Paul Clay]] explains. However, abandoning the idea of the autonomous piece of art can be problematic. ‘Having art that relates very strongly to the market context can fuck up the commodification process in an interesting way. It both points it up as an object to consume, and at the same time makes it harder to effectively remove from its context in order to be sold.’ Furthermore, ‘There is a danger that when curators have too strong an {{sic|?|hide=y|over-|arching}} vision, the artists' works can end up simply as building blocks used to construct the curator's point. On the other hand if the curator's point is weak then the works can get stranded totally out of context’."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hüttner has since developed these strategies both in projects like Repetitive Time,&lt;ref&gt;Per Hüttner: Repetitive Time, 2006, 116 pages including 30 colour plates, texts by Lena Boëthius, Laurent Devèze, Per Hüttner, Claire Canning and Stéphanie Nava, language: English, design by Henrik Gistvall.

==Basic structure==

During six weeks people or groups of people with no prior experience in exhibition making undertook 36 investigative exercises into the process of putting together an exhibition. From the outset, the idea was to create an exhibition each day, but quickly the focus moved to investigate the 57 artworks as a resource. In order to realize this strategy the artist developed some basic concepts:

'''Curator of the Day''': The daily slots were administered through an application process through which we tried to give as many different people as possible, in relation to occupation, age, sex, social and ethnic background. More often than not, the Curator of Day was a small group. Meaning that in the end roughly 70 people were curators.&lt;ref name="Introdictionary" /&gt;

'''The Gallery Crew''': The Gallery Crew was the Curators of the Day’s aid in developing their ideas and the project that they wanted to realize during the day. The Curator of the Day was not allowed to touch the artwork, except in those cases when this was an integral part of the piece. All the handling and mounting of the work was carried out by the Gallery Crew. The crew was also responsible for informing the visitors to the gallery about the project and answering questions.&lt;ref name="Introdictionary" /&gt;

'''Support Structure''': Support Structure hosted all the artwork. It was mobile and it was also used to display work, as well as change the size and appearance of the space. It incorporated two tables and half a dozen chairs that could also be used as plinths to present work on.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.supportstructure.org&lt;/ref&gt; But [[Celine Condorelli]] and [[Gavin Wade]] took their brief further and allowed Support Structure be a questioning and critical tool and an important aspect of the process of the project. The structure took the centre stage, but in an unexpected way the Curators of the Day remained strangely blind to the eleven meter long monster object on wheels and few, if any, references were made to it in their reports.&lt;ref&gt;Support Structures, Celine Condorelli, p. 115-128, Sternberg Press (2009), {{ISBN|978-1-933128-45-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two also offered objects and lists of what to do if the Curator of the Day gets stuck and included phone numbers to well-known contemporary curators.&lt;ref&gt;Paul O'Neill, p.168, Metropolis Rise: New Art from London, edited by Anthony Gross and Jen Wu, {{Proper name|temporarycontemporary}}, London 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Selectors''': To provide a dynamic collection for the Curator of the Day to choose from, six people were asked to select artwork for I Am a Curator. Each devised a different approach for his or her selection. They were [[Patrick Bernier]], [[Melanie Keen]], [[Lisa Le Feuvre]], Tone O. Nielsen, Reid Shier and Per Hüttner.&lt;ref name="Introdictionary" /&gt;

'''The Interface Cards''': A5-sized plastic cards were designed and realized by American artist [[Scott Rigby]]. For each artwork available for selection there was one corresponding Interface Card. The Interface Cards along with the website (which used the same design) were the main tools for the Curator of the Day to select artwork and devise their exhibition.&lt;ref name="Introdictionary" /&gt;

The Website: All the artwork available for selection could be browsed on Chisenhale Gallery’s website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chisenhale.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; There was also continually updated photographic documentation of the exhibitions created by the Curators of the Day.

==The exhibitions and the audience==

Each of the 36 exhibitions realized within the framework of I am a Curator took on very different forms and used the artwork and the space in very different ways. Artist [[Hannah Rickards]] who was leading the gallery crew describes an exhibition that had great impact on the development of the project:&lt;ref name="dialogue"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Embassy of Work With Me ([[å.b.ä.k.e]] /[[Royal College of Art|RCA]]), emptied Support Structure of all its contents, Jokers and artworks, and developed a chromatic scale around the walls of the gallery (the structure having been pushed to the corner). The colour of the individual group members’ clothes determined which works they had responsibility for placing. The process had a very easily achieved self-perpetuating logic that extended to colour-coding drill batteries, [[masking tape]], [[spirit level]]s, any tools that we may have set down for a moment. The colour-coding also included the covers of the CDs bought from the local junk shop in order to complete [[Sam Ely and Lynn Harris]]’ Playlist, along with all the book covers from [[Céline Condorelli]]’s and Gavin Wade's Joker selection of books. This seemed the most natural and successful exercise in [[devolution]] and levelling democratization that occurred during the run of the show. The ‘artworks’ suffered less in this [[melee]] than they often did when not surrounded by a [[chromatic]] sea of things; they were scrutinized and investigated by the curating group."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hüttner talks about a few of the key experiences among the 36 exhibitions:&lt;ref name="dialogue" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;”I have to mention Anton Nikolotov’s project (11/12/03). He wanted the work to be selected democratically. He thus devoted the whole day [[discussion|discussing]] with the visitors which works should be displayed. Each visitor who was present at a given moment was given some time to voice why a certain piece should or shouldn't be shown. When everyone had presented their case, the group [[election|voted]] and notes were taken on the different ideas and how many votes the different pieces got. In the end the only show that was presented was one made up of these notes shown in the massive empty space. This approach allowed I Am a Curator to be taken to another level. The boundaries between Curator of the Day and audience vanished entirely. It was wonderful to see how the process of democratization could be taken one step further than had originally been foreseen. This [[democratic process]] was at once extremely rewarding, but also hugely tiring. Rarely have I seen the members of the Gallery Crew leave so happy and tired. It was also great to see how visitors tended to stay for hours to join the discussion. At one point 15 people were present for the vote."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other shows included Sebastian Roach's Art for Wine Day 13/12/03 which took quite a [[nihilism|nihilist]] approach to the task of selecting work:&lt;ref&gt;”Sebastian Roach is a Curator”, e-mail sent out to Chisenhale mailing list, December 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;”In exchange for the donation of a bottle of wine (or beer, or spirits  – even a miniature, the important thing is the token) a visitor can select and display any piece of work in the show. Alternatively they can donate a new piece of work and I will give them a bottle of wine in exchange for it. In addition, through the course of the day I will install myself in an ‘office’ created by using the versatile structure as walls drinking wine, smoking cigarettes and writing.  What I write will be spontaneous and in response – directly, indirectly, or entirely [[tenuous]]ly – to the work, the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] and the situation, and will obviously also be tempered by the increasing consumption of alcohol. Whatever writing I do produce at the end of the day will also be available in [[Trade|exchange]] for wine."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The diversity of the Curator of the Day and how they interacted with the work can be exemplified by Hüttner's [[endnote]] in the catalogue:&lt;ref name="dialogue" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;” The data that I Am a Curator generated is in itself something that would suffice for a research  project. I was pleased on the last day of the exhibition that the two [[anthropologist]]s Lisa Maddigan and Fuyubi Nakamura did a project that looked at the accumulated information. I think that they were slightly awestruck by the sheer bulk of information and work that could be hosted within the project. It is like the number of possibilities of arranging 57 artworks that Maki from å.b.ä.k.e. had calculated – 144,115,188,075,856,000. Considering that our [[solar system]] is roughly 2,400,000,000,000,000 minutes old [[probability|the number of possibilities]] is quite mind-boggling.
”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Critique==

At the time of the realization of the project there was some rather loud critique towards the project.&lt;ref&gt;p. 157, Barnaby Drabble, Stop making Sense: The Ends of Curating and the Beginnings of the Exhibition, Thesis submitted to the Edinburgh College of Art in fulfilment Of the requirements of the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested&lt;ref&gt;Paul O'Neill, The Culture of Curating and the Curating of Culture(s), 2012, p. 112-14, The MIT Press, Cambridge Massachusetts 02142, {{ISBN|9780262017725}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it offered a very traditional approach to the idea of how an exhibition might be made. In an interview with Barnaby Drabble the artist says.&lt;ref&gt;Per Hüttner, '' Per Hüttner and Gavin Wade interviewed by Barnaby Drabble '', '' Marianne Eigenheer (Hg.) Curating Critique'', '' ICE Reader 1'', 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-86588-451-0}}]&lt;/ref&gt;":

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I do agree, when you are faced with the possibility of just selecting existing art work that is a very traditional take on what a curator is. But then again, I think that I Am A Curator tried to do something that goes beyond that. By using a very traditional approach it enabled us to do something that was extremely creative and which opened new ideas about how to put together exhibitions. In terms of selecting the works, It wasn't as if they had only five pieces to choose from. To consider the work of fifty-seven artists in one afternoon is a major task. Also, a lot of the work was not finished, it was up to the curator of the day to complete it, a lot was interactive, and a lot had different elements that needed to be put together. So there were many different approaches on offer, reflecting the working methods of the original selectors."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another criticism of the project was that the individual artwork never got the attention it deserved.&lt;ref&gt;"Le curating est le reponse...", Paul O'Neill, 02#35, p.14-16, 2005, Nantes, France&lt;/ref&gt; Hannah Rickards who was leading the gallery crew writes:&lt;ref name="dialogue" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Even the 57 official ‘artworks,’ depending on their treatment by the Curator of the Day, sometimes barely managed to retain their “artwork” status. There were times when they did slip into being things in cupboards or things on the wall. That slippage between artworks and objects, or between people’s roles in the process, is something I see as having been central to the project, so I don’t know if I necessarily see the need for a posthumous proliferation of the term “artwork.” It feels like [[lamination|laminating]] a piece of paper you are still making notes on. In the context of this project a wipe-clean definition seems to jar."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a review for ''C: International Contemporary Art Magazine'', [[Fergal Stapleton]] described the exhibition as "a game, mutative and feudal, with several tiers of collusion" and "a bid for curatorial practice as art, and for curatorial supremacy over its subject arts disciplines."&lt;ref name="Stapleton"&gt;{{cite journal|title='I am a curator'.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his PhD thesis Barnaby Drabble uses I am a Curator as one of three case studies. He quotes Stapleton and builds a severe critique to the project which he perceives as being elitist and self-promotional under the guise of being democratic.&lt;ref&gt;p. 155-157, Barnaby Drabble, Stop making Sense: The Ends of Curating and the Beginnings of the Exhibition, Thesis submitted to the Edinburgh College of Art in fulfillment Of the requirements of the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On a more positive note British sociologist and media theorist, [[David Gauntlett]] suggests that projects like I am a Curator expands art into being a visual sociology;&lt;ref&gt;David Gauntlett, "Creative Explorations New Approaches to Identities and Audiences", p. 119-20. Routledge, London, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We should note that, in some cases, the work of socially engaged visual artists and the work of visual sociologists can look very similar. Many artists have used art to explore identity, memory and the construction of selfhood [...]. Other contemporary artists have engaged in a more externally oriented art practice which involves ‘ordinary’ people in the making of work. Just as visual sociology sometimes blurs into something like art, in these projects, art expands into being a kind of visual sociology. There are many instances of such projects; here I will give just a few examples. A project by the artist Per Hüttner, at Chisenhale Gallery, London, entitled I Am a Curator, gave 30 individuals or groups the opportunity to be ‘Curator of the Day’, over a period of six weeks (5 November–14 December 2003). Each day a new exhibition was assembled, using work by 57 artists that was made available in the gallery."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is clear that, I am a Curator offered novel ways for the audience to interact with artwork and the idea of an exhibition. They were forced to deal with art in a more intimate way than in a traditional exhibition. This means that the art on display might have been visible to a smaller audience than in a normal situation and yet at the same time the [[intimacy]], reflection and constant change of context that the work was perceived in, meant that the audience was offered the possibility to understand the complexities and contradictions of artwork on a more profound level.&lt;ref name="dialogue" /&gt; This experimental approach to authorship and authenticity offers opportunity for creative interpretations.&lt;ref name="Form p.134-35"/&gt; This openness in its turn has led to that I am a Curator has been appropriated by various participants of the project as being 'their own' in publications and academic texts.&lt;ref name="Form p.134-35"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jes Fernie, Two Minds: Artists And Architects in Collaboration, p. 136-142, Black Dog Publishing, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ten Year Anniversary==

For the 10 year anniversary of I am a Curator [[David Roberts Art Foundation]] in London invited Per Huttner to reflect on the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vision-forum.blogspot.nl/2013/09/i-am-curator-after-10-years-what.html Vision Forum website]&lt;/ref&gt; In the press release it is stated that "The project also provoked profound questions about artistic identity and its relationship to collectivity. Both shifts, in turn, lead to changed perspectives on the relationship between artworks, exhibitions, curators and artists. In short, IAAC opened a floodgate of problematics that overwhelmed the team working with the project. It is therefore important to revisit these questions after 10 years have passed, and to see how they have influenced individual artistic processes and how they can guide us into meaningful future reflections on related issues."&lt;ref&gt;Press release on The David Roberts Art Foundation website [http://davidrobertsartfoundation.com/projects/i-am-a-curator-after-10-years-what-defines-an-artistic-practice-tuesday-29-october-2013-6-30-to-8-30pm]/&lt;/ref&gt; Per Hüttner was joined by artist/architect [[Céline Condorelli]], [[neuroscientist]] [[Stephen Whitmarsh]] and Anette and [[Alberto Giacometti Foundation]] Director [[Véronique Wiesinger]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7474">'''Information art''' (also '''data art''' or '''informatism''') is an emerging field of [[electronic art]] that synthesizes [[computer science]], [[information technology]], and more classical forms of art, including [[performance art]], [[visual art]], [[new media art]] and [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward A. Shanken]] has argued that little scholarship has explored the relationship between technology and [[conceptual art]]. He also claimed that there was an art-historical impetus to artificially distinguish information art from conceptual art. [[Edward A. Shanken]], 'Art in the Information Age: Technology and Conceptual Art,' in [[Michael Corris]] (ed.), Conceptual Art: Theory, Myth and Practice Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Information Art often includes [[interaction]] with [[computer]]s that generate artistic content based on the processing of large amounts of data.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Charlie Gere]] ''Art, Time and Technology: Histories of the Disappearing Body'' (Berg, 2005). {{ISBN|978-1-84520-135-7}} This text concerns artistic and theoretical responses to the increasing speed of technological development and operation, especially in terms of  draws on the ideas of [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Bernard Stiegler]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and [[André Leroi-Gourhan]], and looks at the work of [[Samuel Morse]], [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Kasimir Malevich]], among others.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[Image:Info1970.jpg|thumb|150px|Kynaston McShine's "Information"]]
Informatism follows on the 1970 exhibition organized by [[Kynaston McShine]] called  "Information", held at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City - a show  that formally established [[conceptual art]] as a leading tendency in the United States. Conceptual art had emerged simultaneously in dozens of international locations around 1966.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Lucy R. Lippard]], ''Six Years: the Dematerialization of the Art Object From 1966 to 1972'' (1973. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time arose the activities of [[Experiments in Art and Technology]] known as E.A.T.&lt;ref&gt;E.A.T. followed from the event Nine Evenings: Theatre and Engineering, organised by [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Billy Klüver]] at the Armoury Building, New York City, 13–22 October 1966 to promote the collaboration between artists and engineers. They also organised the Pepsi Pavilion at the World's Fair, [[Osaka]], in 1970. For a detailed discussion of the project see Bijvoet, Art as Inquiry, ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic practice ==
Information art [[data]] can be manifested using [[photograph]]s, [[census]] data, micropayments, personal profiles and expressions, [[video]] clips, [[search engine]] results, [[digital painting]], network signals, and [[prose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McKeough, Tim|title=Frame That Spam!

{{Antisemitism}}

The "'''Jewish question'''", also referred to as the "'''Jewish problem'''", was a wide-ranging debate in 19th- and 20th-century [[Europe]]an society pertaining to the appropriate status and treatment of [[Jews]] in society. The debate was similar to other so-called "[[national question]]s" and dealt with the civil, legal, national and political [[Status (law)|status]] of Jews as a minority within society, particularly in Europe in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.

The debate started within societies, politicians and writers in [[western Europe|western]] and [[central Europe]] influenced by the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the ideals of the [[French Revolution]]. The issues included the legal and economic [[disabilities (Jewish)|Jewish disabilities]] (e.g. [[Jewish quota]]s and [[Jewish ghetto|segregation]]), [[Jewish assimilation]], [[Jewish emancipation]] and [[Jewish Enlightenment]].

The expression has been used by [[antisemitic]] movements from the 1880s onwards, culminating in the [[Nazi terminology|Nazi phrase]] "the [[Final Solution]] to the Jewish Question". Similarly, the expression was used by proponents for and opponents of the establishment of an autonomous [[Jewish homeland]] or a sovereign [[Jewish state]].

==History of "The Jewish question"==

{{further|History of the Jews in Europe}}
The term "Jewish question" was first used in Great Britain around 1750 when the expression "Jewish question" appeared during the [[Jew Bill of 1753]] debates in England.&lt;ref name=odk&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Holocaust studies|Holocaust scholar]] [[Lucy Dawidowicz]], the term "Jewish Question," as introduced in [[western Europe]], was a neutral expression for the negative attitude toward the apparent and persistent singularity of the Jews as a people against the background of the rising political nationalisms and new [[nation-state]]s. Dawidowicz writes that "the histories of Jewish emancipation and of European antisemitism are replete with proffered 'solutions to the Jewish question.'"&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Dawidowicz, ''The War Against the Jews, 1933-1945'' (New York, 1975), pp. xxi-xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The question was next discussed in France (''la question juive'') after the French Revolution in 1789. It has arrived in Germany in 1843 via Bruno Bauer's treatise ''Die Judenfrage'' ("The Jewish Question"). He argued that Jews can achieve political emancipation only if they let go their religious consciousness as he proposed that political emancipation required a [[secular state]]. In 1898, [[Theodore Herzl]]'s treatise, ''[[Der Judenstaat]]'', advocates [[Zionism]] as a "modern solution for the Jewish question" by creating an independent Jewish state, preferably in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Herzl |first1= Theodor |authorlink1= Theodor Herzl |others= transl.

According to Otto Dov Kulka&lt;ref&gt;As of 2008 Otto Dov Kulka's works are out of print, but the following may be useful and is available on microfilm: ''Reminiscences of Otto Dov Kulka'' (Glen Rock, New Jersey: Microfilming Corp. of America, 1975), {{ISBN|0-88455-598-4}} and 9780884555988, OCLC 5326379.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Hebrew University]], the term became widespread in the nineteenth century when it was used in discussions about [[Jewish emancipation]] in Germany (''Judenfrage'').&lt;ref name=odk /&gt; In the 19th century hundreds of tractates, pamphlets, newspaper articles and books were written on the subject, with many offering solutions including resettlement, deportation and assimilation of the Jewish population. Similarly, hundreds of pieces of literature were written opposing these solutions and have offered solutions such as re-integration and education. This debate however, could not decide whether the problem of the Jewish Question had more to do with the problems posed by the German Jews' opponents or vice versa: the problem posed by the existence of the German Jews to their opponents.

From around 1860 the notion took on an increasingly antisemitic tendency: Jews were described under this title as a stumbling block to the identity and cohesion of the German nation and as enemies within the Germans' own country. Antisemites such as [[Wilhelm Marr]], [[Karl Eugen Dühring]], [[Theodor Fritsch]], [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], [[Paul de Lagarde]] and others declared it a racial problem unsolvable through integration, in order to make their demands for the "de-jewifying" of the press, education, culture, state and economy, plausible, along with their demands for the condemnation of inter-marriage between Jews and non-Jews. They also used this definition to oust the Jews out of their supposedly socially dominant positions.

By far the most infamous use of this expression was by the [[Nazi]]s in the early- and mid- twentieth century, culminating in the implementation of their "[[Final Solution]] to the Jewish question" during [[World War II]].&lt;!-- The following ref is used here to establish the meaning of Judenfrage, but is reused later. --&gt;&lt;ref name=ah&gt;{{Cite web

==Bruno Bauer – ''The Jewish Question''==
In his book ''[[The Jewish Question]]'', published in 1843, [[Bruno Bauer|Bauer]] argued that Jews can achieve political emancipation only if they relinquish their particular religious consciousness, since political emancipation requires a [[secular state]], which he assumes does not leave any "space" for social identities such as [[religion]]. According to Bauer, such religious demands are incompatible with the idea of the "[[Rights of Man]]." True political emancipation, for Bauer, requires the abolition of religion.

==Karl Marx – ''On the Jewish Question''==
[[Karl Marx]] replied to Bauer in his 1844 essay ''[[On the Jewish Question]]''. Marx contradicted Bauer's view that the nature of the Jewish religion prevented Judaism's assimilation. Instead he focused on the specific social and economic role of the Jewish group in Europe which, according to him, was lost when capitalism, the material basis for Judaism, assimilated the European societies as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/jewish-question/index.htm |title=On the Jewish Question |accessdate=2008-03-25 |author=Karl Marx |authorlink=Karl Marx |date=February 1844 |work=Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx uses Bauer's essay as an occasion for his own analysis of liberal rights. Marx argues that Bauer is mistaken in his assumption that in a "[[secular state]]", religion will no longer play a prominent role in social life, and, as an example refers to the pervasiveness of religion in the [[United States]], which, unlike Prussia, had no [[state religion]]. In Marx's analysis, the "secular state" is not opposed to religion, but rather actually requires it. The removal of religious or property qualifications for citizens does not mean the abolition of religion or property, but only introduces a way of regarding individuals in abstraction from them.&lt;ref name="Marx"&gt;Marx 1844:{{Block quote|[T]he political annulment of private property not only fails to abolish private property but even presupposes it. The state abolishes, in its own way, distinctions of birth, social rank, education, occupation, when it declares that birth, social rank, education, occupation, are non-political distinctions, when it proclaims, without regard to these distinctions, that every member of the nation is an equal participant in national sovereignty, when it treats all elements of the real life of the nation from the standpoint of the state. Nevertheless, the state allows private property, education, occupation, to act in their way – i.e., as private property, as education, as occupation, and to exert the influence of their special nature. Far from abolishing these real distinctions, the state only exists on the presupposition of their existence; it feels itself to be a political state and asserts its universality only in opposition to these elements of its being.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On this note Marx moves beyond the question of religious freedom to his real concern with Bauer's analysis of "political emancipation." Marx concludes that while individuals can be 'spiritually' and 'politically' free in a secular state, they can still be bound to material constraints on freedom by economic inequality, an assumption that would later form the basis of his critiques of [[capitalism]].

Between 1880 and 1920, millions of other Jews sought their own solution for the [[pogroms]] of eastern Europe by emigration to other places, such as the [[United States]] and western Europe.

==The Final Solution==
In [[Nazi Germany]], the term ''Jewish Question'' (in {{lang-de|Judenfrage}}) referred to the sense that the existence of Jews in Germany posed a problem for the state. In 1933 two Nazi theorists, [[Johann von Leers]] and [[Achim Gercke]], both proposed that the Jewish Question could be solved by [[Madagascar plan|resettling Jews in Madagascar]] or elsewhere in Africa or South America. Both intellectuals discussed the pros and cons of supporting the German Zionists as well, but von Leers asserted that establishing a Jewish homeland in British Palestine would create humanitarian and political problems for the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

=== Propaganda ===
[[Nazi propaganda]] was produced to manipulate the public, most notably based on writings from people such as [[Eugen Fischer]], [[Fritz Lenz]] and [[Erwin Baur]] in ''Foundations of Human Heredity Teaching and Racial Hygiene''. The work {{lang|de|Die Freigabe der Vernichtung lebensunwerten Lebens}} (''Allowing the Destruction of Life Unworthy of Living'') by [[Karl Binding]] and [[Alfred Hoche]] and the pseudo-scholarship created by [[Gerhard Kittel]] also played a role. In occupied France, the collaborationist regime established its own [[Institut d'étude des questions juives|Institute for studying the Jewish Questions]].

== Contemporary use ==
A dominant anti-Semitic conspiracy theory is that Jewish people have undue influence over the media, banking and politics. Based on this conspiracy theory certain groups and activists discuss the "Jewish Question" and propose to "address" it. They often refer to it as the JQ.&lt;ref&gt;"JQ stands for the 'Jewish Question,' an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Jewish people have undue influence over the media, banking and politics that must somehow be addressed" (Christopher Mathias, Jenna Amatulli, Rebecca Klein, 2018, The HuffPost 03/03/2018, https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-public-school-teacher-white-nationalist-podcast_us_5a99ae32e4b089ec353a1fba)&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[white nationalism|white nationalists]], [[alt-right]]ers, and [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]] have used the initialism '''JQ''' to refer to the Jewish question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kestenbaum|first1=Sam|title=White Nationalists Create New Shorthand for the 'Jewish Question'|url=http://forward.com/news/356773/among-white-nationalists-catchy-new-shorthand-for-the-jewish-question/|website=[[The Forward]]|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lantian Man''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|蓝田|人}}|t={{linktext|藍田|人}}|p={{linktext|Lántián| rén}}}}), formerly ''Sinanthropus lantianensis'' (currently ''Homo erectus lantianensis'') is a subspecies of ''[[Homo erectus]]''. Its discovery in 1963 was first described by J. K. Woo the following year. The cranial capacity is estimated to be {{convert|780|cm3|cuin}}, somewhat similar to that of its contemporary, [[Java Man]].

Remnants of Lantian Man were found in [[Lantian County]], in China's [[Shaanxi]] province, approximately 50&amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[Xi'an]]. Shortly after the discovery of the [[Human mandible|mandible]] (jaw bone) of the first Lantian Man at [[Chenjiawo]] (陈家窝), also in Lantian, a [[Human cranium|cranium]] (skull) with nasal bones, right maxilla, and three teeth of another specimen of Lantian Man were found at [[Gongwangling]] (公王岭), another site in Lantian. 

== Dating ==
A skull found at Gongwangling is the oldest fossil of a ''[[Homo erectus]]'' ever found in northern Asia. When first published in 1964, it was dated to 1.15 million years ago,&lt;ref name="zimmer"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/science/hominins-tools-china.html|title=Archaeologists in China Discover the Oldest Stone Tools Outside Africa|last=Zimmer|first=Carl|date=2018-07-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2001, Zhu Zhaoyu ({{lang|zh-Hans|朱照宇}}), a geologist at the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], and other scientists began a fresh research of the site.&lt;ref name="zimmer"/&gt; Their new analysis was published in 2015, which has determined that the strata containing the cranium from Gongwangling dates to approximately 1.63 million years ago, much older than the previous estimate of 1.15 million years.

== Tool Complex ==
Until the 1980s it had been commonly accepted that comparisons between European and Asian [[Paleolithic]] cultures were not possible. The common thinking was that there was too great a difference between their tool technologies. In the 1940s a researcher, H.L. Movius, proposed that the Paleolithic West was made up of "hand axe cultures", while the East had "chopper-chopping tool cultures". Numerous research into technological traditions followed the model proposed by Movius in support of the East/West technology divide.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Twenty-six lithic artifacts were uncovered in the same loess sedimentary deposit as the cranium from the Gongwangling site in Lantian County, China. The artifacts consisted of cores, flakes, choppers, hand-axes, spheroids, and scrapers. Lab analysis suggested that the "early hominins chose quartzite, quartz, greywacke and igneous rock pebbles/cobbles on the riverbank for stone knapping, whereas the fine sandstone, siliceous limestone and chert were used only occasionally." Studying the assemblage from Gongwangling along with a series of other sites in the Lantian region leads researchers to believe that the tools utilized by the hominids are more similar to the [[Acheulean]] tools utilized in the West than previously thought. This means that the tool technology is not different, and still consists of more large hand tools e.g. hand-axes than previous researchers thought and represents a continuum of technology from the West rather than two separately occurring technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Chronological and typo-technological perspectives on the Palaeolithic archaeology in Lantian, central China|last = Wang|first = Shejiang|date = July 2014|journal = Quaternary International|volume = 347|pages = 183–192|doi = 10.1016/j.quaint.2014.07.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lily-White Movement''' was an anti-[[African-American Civil Rights|civil-rights]] movement within the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The movement was a response to the political and socioeconomic gains made by African-Americans following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution]], which eliminated slavery.

During [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], following the [[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]], black leaders in Texas and around the country gained increasing influence in the Republican Party by organizing blacks as an important voting bloc via [[Union League]]s and the biracial [[Black-and-tan faction]] of the Republicans. Conservative whites attempted to eliminate this influence and recover white voters who had defected to the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]. The effort was largely successful in eliminating African-American influence in the Republican Party leading to black voters predominantly migrating to the Democratic Party for much of the 20th century.

The term ''lily-white movement'' was coined by [[Texas Republican Party|Texas Republican]] leader [[Norris Wright Cuney]], who used the term in an 1888 Republican convention to describe efforts by white conservatives to oust blacks from positions of Texas party leadership and incite riots to divide the party.&lt;ref name="Myrdal 1996, pg. 478"&gt;Myrdal (1996), pg. 478&lt;/ref&gt; The term came to be used nationally to describe this ongoing movement as it further developed in the early 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=NEGROES LOSE FIGHT IN NORTH CAROLINA; Pritchard's "Lilly Whites" Recognized by the President.

Localized movements began immediately after the war but by the beginning of the 20th century the effort had become national.

According to author and professor Michael K. Fauntroy, "the 'Lily-White Movement' is one of the darkest, and under-examined ''{{sic}}'', eras of American Republicanism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Republicans and the Black Vote |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |author=Michael K.

==Background==
{{Main|African-American Civil Rights Movement (1865–1896)}}

Immediately following the war all of the Southern states enacted "[[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]]," laws intended specifically to curtail the rights of the newly freed slaves. Many Northern states enacted their own "Black Codes" restricting or barring black immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=African American History | accessdate=10 October 2009 | publisher=MSN Encarta | url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761595158_3/African_American_History.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwsezS0j|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], however, nullified most of these laws and the federal Freedman's Bureau was able to regulate many of the affairs of Southern blacks, who were granted the right to vote in 1867. Groups such as the [[Union League]] and the [[Radical Republicans]] sought total equality and complete integration of blacks into American society. The Republican Party itself held significant power in the South during [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] because of the federal government's role.&lt;ref name="Brady 2008, pg. 154"&gt;Brady (2008), pg. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]], Union Leagues were formed across the South after 1867 as all-black working auxiliaries of the Republican Party. They were secret organizations that mobilized [[freedmen]] to register to vote and to vote Republican. They discussed political issues, promoted civic projects, and mobilized workers opposed to certain employers. Most branches were segregated but there were a few that were racially integrated. The leaders of the all-black units were mostly urban blacks from the North, who had never been slaves. Historian [[Eric Foner]] reports:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leon F. Litwack and August Meier, eds.|title=Black Leaders of the Nineteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QB-Y2Ejlp9oC&amp;pg=PA221|year=1991|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|By the end of 1867 it seemed that virtually every black voter in the South had enrolled in the Union League, the Loyal League, or some equivalent local political organization. Meetings were generally held in a black church or school.|Eric Foner | Black Leaders of the Nineteenth Century}}

During the 19th century numerous African Americans were elected to the [[United States Congress]], all members of the Republican Party. In the South the party was a voting coalition of Freedmen (freed slaves), [[Carpetbaggers]] (recent arrivals from the North), and [[Scalawags]] (Southern whites, especially men who had been Unionists in the War). In Texas, blacks comprised 90% of the party members during the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Handbook of Texas | title=AFRICAN AMERICANS AND POLITICS | id=wmafr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first black [[United States Senate|senator]] was [[Hiram Rhodes Revels]] of [[Mississippi]]. The first black [[United States House of Representatives|representative]] was [[John Willis Menard]] of Louisiana. Over the course of the century, an additional black senator (from Mississippi) would be elected and more than 20 black representatives would be elected from Louisiana, [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alabama]], [[Florida]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Virginia]].

Blacks held other powerful political positions in government. [[P. B. S. Pinchback]] was elected lieutenant governor of Louisiana and even served briefly as governor. Pierre Caliste Landry became mayor of [[Donaldsonville, Louisiana]]. [[Edward Duplex]] became mayor of [[Wheatland, California]].

In the South the Republican party gradually came to be known as "the party of the Negro."&lt;ref name="Macmillan's: Future"&gt;{{Cite journal | title=The Future of the Negro | work=Macmillan's magazine | page=449 | author=Masson, David; Masson, George; Morley, John; Morris, Mowbray Walter | year=1900 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J1ZkOe4ZpOIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Texas, for example, blacks made 90% of the party during the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Handbook of Texas | title=AFRICAN AMERICANS AND POLITICS | id=AA/wmafr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Democratic party increasingly came to be seen by many in the white community as the party of respectability.&lt;ref name="Macmillan's: Future"/&gt; The first [[Ku Klux Klan]] targeted violence against black Republican leaders and seriously undercut the Union League.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Hahn, ''A nation under our feet: Black political struggles in the rural South, from slavery to the great migration'' (2003). pp 165-205&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1870s through early 1890s, Democrats in Southern states used various methods to suppress the vote of blacks, largely intimidation, violence and fraud.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Republicans responded by challenging the election results and overturning them in order to count the votes of blacks.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} This was much more successful when Republicans held an uncontested majority of the US House than otherwise.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Republican factionalism==
[[Image:Norris_Wright_Cuney.jpg | thumb|Norris Wright Cuney, the first African-American chairman of the Texas Republican Party]]
From the beginning of Reconstruction, conservative Southern white factions fought against the [[black-and-tan faction]], coalitions of blacks and liberal whites, for control of the Republican Party. White Republican leaders became increasingly concerned about the exodus of white voters in other parts of the country, some out of concerns for the strength of the party and some for purely racist reasons, thus giving impetus to what would be called the ''lily-white movement''.

Blacks increasingly demanded more and more offices at the expense of the Scalawags.  The more numerous black-and-tan element typically won the factional battles; many Scalawags joined the opposing lily-whites or switched to the Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Woolfolk Wiggins, ''The Scalawag in Alabama Politics, 1865-1881'' (University of Alabama Press, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Wetta, ''The Louisiana Scalawags: Politics, Race, and Terrorism during the Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The black-and-tans predominated in counties with large black populations, as the whites in these counties were usually Democrats, whereas the lily-whites were found mostly in the counties where fewer blacks lived.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Following the death of Texas Republican leader [[Edmund J. Davis]] in 1883, black civil rights leader [[Norris Wright Cuney]] rose to the Republican chairmanship in Texas, becoming the national committeeman in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{Handbook of Texas | title=LATE NINETEENTH-CENTURY TEXAS | id=npl01}}&lt;/ref&gt; While blacks were a minority overall in Texas, Cuney's rise to this position caused a backlash among white conservative Republicans in other areas, leading to the lily-white's becoming a more organized, nationwide effort. Cuney himself coined the term ''lily-white movement'' to describe rapidly intensifying organized efforts by white conservatives to oust blacks from positions of party leadership and incite riots to divide the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Myrdal, Gunnar |author2=Bok, Sissela | title=An American dilemma: the Negro problem and modern democracy | year=1944 | page=478 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yuAEokAx2G4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors contend that the effort was coordinated with Democrats as part of a larger movement toward [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchisement]] of blacks in the South by increasing restrictions in voter registration rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Republicans and the Black Vote | author=Fauntroy, Michael K. | year=2007 | publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers | page=43 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RyuHAAAAMAAJ | quote="... lily whites worked with Democrats to disenfranchise African Americans."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Black disfranchisement in Southern states==
By 1890 the Democratic Party had gained control of all state legislatures in the South (with a few brief exceptions as in North Carolina). By the beginning of the 20th century black political influence was in freefall. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states accomplished disenfranchisement of blacks and, in some states, many poor whites.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Perman, ''Struggle for Mastery: Disfranchisement in the South, 1888-1908'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; During the first three decades of the 20th century blacks were excluded from the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Negroes’ Temporary Farewell: Jim Crow and the Exclusion of African Americans from Congress, 1887–1929 | publisher=Black Americans in Congress (House of Representatives) | accessdate=9 October 2009 | url=http://baic.house.gov/historical-essays/essay.html?intID=5&amp;intSectionID=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1890s most blacks had abandoned or were prevented from seeking office in the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref name="Brady 2008, pg. 154"/&gt; The last five African Americans that served in Congress, all college-educated, were the product of Reconstruction era educational and economic opportunities which were significantly eroded in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Brady (2008), pg. 155&lt;/ref&gt; The last black Congressman of this earlier era departed the Congress in 1901. Blacks still had some influence in the Republican party but their influence continued to decline rapidly.

==Downfall of black Republicans==
By the beginning of the 20th century, black political influence was in freefall, both because the Republican lily-white movement and the efforts by the Democratic Southern governments. During the first three decades of the 20th century, no blacks served in the U.S. Congress due to their disenfranchisement across the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Negroes’ Temporary Farewell: Jim Crow and the Exclusion of African Americans from Congress, 1887–1929 | publisher=Black Americans in Congress (House of Representatives) | accessdate=9 October 2009 | url=http://baic.house.gov/historical-essays/essay.html?intID=5&amp;intSectionID=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s, the lily-white movement had largely succeeded in establishing almost total white supremacy in the party. Black leaders were barred in 1922 from the [[Virginia]] Republican Congressional Convention. The state had imposed racial segregation of public places and disenfranchised most blacks by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Virginia Party Politics | accessdate=9 October 2009 | publisher=Virginia Center for Digital History (University of Virginia) | url=http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/politics/party.html}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news | title=NEGROES AGAIN BARRED FROM G.O.P. CONVENTION | work=Daily Progress | date=July 23, 1922 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a national level, the Republican Party made some attempts to respond to black interests.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis L. Gould, ''The Republicans: A History of the Grand Old Party'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vincent P. De Santis, ''Republicans face the southern question: The new departure years, 1877-1897'' (1959).&lt;/ref&gt; The party proposed federal legislation to prohibit [[lynching]], which was always defeated by the Southern bloc. In 1920 Republicans made opposition to [[lynching in the United States|lynching]] part of their platform at the Republican National Convention. Lynchings, primarily of black men in the South, had increased in the decades around the turn of the 20th century. [[Leonidas C. Dyer]], a white Republican Representative from [[St. Louis, Missouri]], worked with the NAACP to introduce an anti-lynching bill into the House, where he gained strong passage in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;George C. Rable, "The South and the Politics of Antilynching Legislation, 1920-1940." ''Journal of Southern History'' 51.2 (1985): 201-220. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2208825 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the [[black-and-tan faction|Black and Tan]] partisans who continued to hold appointed office was [[Walter L. Cohen]] of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], the customs inspector and later comptroller of customs. He gained appointments from four Republican presidents and continued in office through the [[Calvin Coolidge]] administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lahistory.org/site20.php|author=[[Louisiana Historical Association]]|title=A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography|publisher=lahistory.org|accessdate=December 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[NAACP]] national convention in 1926, the delegates expressed their disappointment with the party:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Black Americans in Congress, 1870-2007 | author=Wasniewski, Matthew ; Office of History and Preservation House | publisher=Government Printing Office | year=2008 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-cNiPp-D260C | page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Our political salvation and our social survival lie in our absolute independence of party allegiance in politics and the casting of our vote for our friends and against our enemies whoever they may be and whatever party labels they carry.|NAACP | 1926 Convention}}

An interesting historical irony is that, though strengthening the Republican Party in the South was a major motivation of the movement, the party faded to near irrelevance in the South during the early 20th century despite the movement's success.

==Aftermath==

Lily-white/black-and-tan factionalism flared up in 1928,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lisio, Donald J. | title=Hoover, Blacks, and Lily-Whites: A Study of Southern Strategies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YAWcOqUNRckC&amp;pg=PA37|year=2012|publisher=U North Carolina Press |page=37ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Herbert Hoover tried to appeal to southern whites; and 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marty Cohen|title=The Party Decides: Presidential Nominations Before and After Reform|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CEw9ROwagN0C&amp;pg=PA118|year=2009|page=118|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving Black-and-tan factions lost heavily in 1964 and practically vanished. Due to Democratic support of the civil rights movement and Congressional passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], the shift of African Americans toward Democratic candidates accelerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert David Johnson|title=All the Way with LBJ: The 1964 Presidential Election|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oc4_3JKYvo0C&amp;pg=PA84|year=2009|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1751">'''Media Scape''' is a set of meetings with exhibitions, film/video programs and symposia of international artists in the context of [[media art]]. Media Scape was founded in May 1991 by [[Heiko Daxl]], [[Ingeborg Fülepp]], [[Bojan Baletic]] and [[Malcolm Le Grice]] in [[Zagreb]] (Croatia).

From 1991 to 1999 Media Scape took place annually in the [[Mimara Museum]], in the MultimediaCentar, in the HDLU (Hrvatsko drustvo likovnih umjetnika - Croatian Association of Fine Arts) and in the Museum for Contemporary Art in Zagreb. Within this time frame around 300 artists from more than 30 countries participated.

In the year 2005 Media Scape moved into the Galerija Rigo/Museum Lapidarium in the city of [[Novigrad, Istria]] (Cittánova), led by Jerica Ziherl, in the Croatian region of [[Istria]].
Since 2006 in co-operation with [[Noam Braslavsky]] the Galerie der Künste (GdK) in [[Berlin]], became an additional venue under the title "[[Strictly Berlin]]".
In 2010 Media Scape came back to Zagreb under the title "The Year We Make Contact" and will continue in 2013 as the MSBZ "Media Scape Biennale Zagreb" for Contemporary Time Based Art.

In [[narrative]], a '''motif''' {{audio|en-us-motif.ogg|(pronunciation)}} is any recurring element that has symbolic significance in a story. Through its [[repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]], a motif can help produce other narrative (or literary) aspects such as [[Theme (narrative)|theme]] or [[Mood (literature)|mood]].&lt;ref name="Grayson"&gt;James H. Grayson. ''Myths and Legends from Korea: An Annotated Compendium of Ancient and Modern Materials'' (p. 9). [[New York City|New York]] and [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]]: [[Routledge]] Curzon, 2000.  {{ISBN|0-7007-1241-0}}. 
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="filmnoir"&gt;Alain Silver and James Ursini, (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=QHe_SWJmzhMC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=visual+motifs&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1ClxsM2m2Z&amp;sig=ebuLVrJ43mhalhDEv8CaMiw8Vzg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bbqKS6K0Ho2wtgfriO2tDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=visual%20motifs&amp;f=false Some Visual Motifs of ''Film Noir''], {{ISBN|0-87910-197-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A narrative motif can be created through the use of [[imagery]], structural components, [[language]], and other narrative elements. The flute in [[Arthur Miller]]'s play ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' is a recurrent sound motif that conveys rural and idyllic notions. Another example from modern [[American literature]] is the green light found in the novel ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' by [[F.&amp;nbsp;Scott Fitzgerald]].

Narratives may include multiple motifs of varying types.  In [[Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Macbeth]]'', he uses a variety of narrative elements to create many different motifs. [[Imagism|Imagistic]] references to blood and water are continually repeated. The phrase "fair is foul, and foul is fair" is echoed at many points in the play, a combination that mixes the concepts of [[good and evil]]. The play also features the central motif of the [[Hand washing|washing of hands]], one that combines both verbal images and the movement of the actors.

In a narrative, a motif establishes a pattern of ideas that may serve different conceptual purposes in different works.   [[Kurt Vonnegut]], for example, in his [[Nonlinear narrative|non-linear]] narratives such as ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' and ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'' makes frequent use of ''motif'' to connect different moments that might seem otherwise separated by time and space.&lt;ref&gt;"Kurt Vonnegut, Jr." ''Encyclopedia of World Biography''. Thomson Gale. 2004. HighBeam Research. 26 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In the American [[science fiction]] [[Cult following|cult]] classic ''[[Blade Runner]]'', director [[Ridley Scott]] uses motifs to not only establish a dark and shadowy [[film noir]] atmosphere,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboutfilm.com/movies/b/bladerunner.htm Blade]&lt;/ref&gt; but also to weave together the thematic complexities of the plot. Throughout the film, the recurring motif of "eyes" is connected to a constantly changing flow of images, and sometimes violent manipulations, in order to call into question our ability, and the narrator's own, to accurately perceive and understand reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Saini, Tinku|year=1996|url=http://scribble.com/uwi/br/tinku/|title=Eye disbelieve|publisher=Tinku Saini, University of Washington|accessdate=2008-01-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071227024439/http://scribble.com/uwi/br/tinku/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=McCoy, John|url=http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~syverson/309-fall95/classpage/bladerunner/mccoy/|title=The Eyes Tell All|publisher=University of Texas at Austin|accessdate=2008-02-01|year=1995|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916221220/http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~syverson/309-fall95/classpage/bladerunner/mccoy/|archivedate=2013-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, pp. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
Any number of narrative elements with symbolic significance can be classified as motifs—whether they are images, spoken or written phrases, structural or stylistic devices, or other elements like sound, physical movement, or visual components in dramatic narratives. While it may appear interchangeable with the related concept ''theme'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = WordNet 3.0 | publisher = Princeton University | year = 2006 | url = http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=theme | accessdate = 2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; a general rule is that a theme is abstract and a motif is concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abbott|first=H. Porter|title=The Cambridge Introduction to Narrative|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-88719-9|pages=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jyyt1826rhsC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=motif+theme&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cY5nT-rqJIGcgwf28ZXeAg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=motif%20theme&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theme is usually defined as a message, statement, or idea, while a motif is simply a detail repeated for larger symbolic meaning.  In other words, a narrative motif—a detail repeated in a pattern of meaning—can produce a theme; but it can also create other narrative aspects. Nevertheless, the distinction between the two terms remains difficult to pinpoint.  For instance, the term "[[thematic patterning]]" has been used to describe the way in which "recurrent thematic concepts" are patterned to produce meaning, such as the "moralistic motifs" found throughout the stories of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''.&lt;ref name="Heath"&gt;{{citation|first=Peter|last=Heath|title=Reviewed work(s) ''Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights'' by David Pinault|journal=[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]|volume=26|issue=2|date=May 1994|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=358–360 [359–60]|doi=10.1017/s0020743800060633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12531">'''Narcissistic rage''' is a reaction to '''narcissistic injury''', which is a perceived threat to a [[narcissist|narcissist's]] [[self-esteem]] or self-worth.  ''Narcissistic injury'' (or ''narcissistic scar'') is a phrase used by [[Sigmund Freud]] in the 1920s; ''narcissistic wound'' and ''narcissistic blow'' are further, almost interchangeable terms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Salman Akhtar]], ''Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (London 2009) p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''narcissistic rage'' was coined by [[Heinz Kohut]] in 1972.

Narcissistic injury occurs when a narcissist feels that their hidden, "true self" has been revealed. This may be the case when the narcissist experiences a "fall from grace", such as when their hidden behaviors or motivations are revealed, or when their importance is [[Egotism|brought into question]]. Narcissistic injury is a cause of distress and can lead to [[Emotional dysregulation|dysregulation]] of behaviors as in narcissistic rage.

Narcissistic rage occurs on a continuum, which may range from instances of aloofness and expressions of mild irritation or annoyance to serious outbursts, including [[Violence|violent attacks]] and [[murder]].&lt;ref name="isbn1-58562-204-4"/&gt;  Narcissistic rage reactions are not limited to [[personality disorders]] and may be also seen in [[catatonic]], [[paranoid delusion]] and depressive episodes.&lt;ref name="isbn1-58562-204-4"&gt;{{cite book |author= Carl P. Malmquist|title=Homicide: A Psychiatric Perspective |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc |location= |year=2006 |pages=181–82  |isbn=1-58562-204-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that narcissists have two layers of rage. The first layer of rage can be thought of as a constant anger (towards someone else), with the second layer being a [[Self-hatred|self-aimed wrath]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sam Vaknin|Vaknin, Sam]], ''Malignant Self Love: Narcissism Revisited'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud and narcissist blows==

In his 1914 case study of the "[[The Wolfman (Freud essay)|Wolfman]]", Freud identified the cause of the latter's adult [[neurosis]] as the moment when "he was forced to realise that his gonorrheal infection constituted a serious injury to his body. The blow to his narcissism was too much for him and he went to pieces".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (P. F. L. 9) p. 340&lt;/ref&gt;  A few years later, in ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'', looking at the inevitable setbacks of childhood sexuality, Freud maintained that "loss of love and failure leave behind them a permanent injury to self-regard in the form of a narcissistic scar... [[Human self-reflection|reflecting]] the full extent to which he has been 'scorned'".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (P. F. L. 11) p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further psychoanalytic developments==

Freud's concept of what in his very last book he called "early injuries to the self (injuries to narcissism)"&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Moses and Monotheism'' (Letchworth 1939) p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; was  subsequently extended by a wide variety of psychoanalysts. [[Karl Abraham]] saw the key to adult depressions in the childhood experience of a blow to narcissism through the loss of [[narcissistic supply]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto Fenichel]] confirmed the importance of narcissistic injury in depressives&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded such analyses to include [[Borderline personality disorder|borderline personalities]].&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 451&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edmund Bergler]] emphasized the importance of infantile [[megalomania|omnipotence]] in narcissism,&lt;ref&gt;Arnold M. Cooper, in Arnold M. Cooper ed., ''Contemporary Psychoanalysis in America'' (2006) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; and the rage that follows any blow to that sense of narcissistic omnipotence;&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Bergler, in Jon Halliday/Peter Fuller eds., ''The Psychology of Gambling'' (London 1974) pp. 176, 182&lt;/ref&gt; [[Annie Reich]] stressed how a feeling of shame fuelled rage, when a blow to narcissism exposed the gap between one's ego ideal and mundane reality;&lt;ref&gt;Mark O'Connell, ''John Banville's Narcissistic Fictions'' (2013) p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanians]] linked Freud on the narcissistic wound to Lacan on the [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|narcissistic mirror stage]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Murray/Alan K. Smith, ''Repossessions'' (1998) p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally [[object relations theory]] highlights rage against early environmental failures that left patients feeling bad about themselves when childhood omnipotence was too abruptly challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1996) pp. 86, 131–32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kohut and self psychology==

Heinz Kohut explored a wide range of rage experiences in his seminal article "Thoughts on Narcissism and Narcissistic Rage" (1972).&lt;ref&gt;Paul H. Ornstein, in Cooper ed., p. 451&lt;/ref&gt; He considered narcissistic rage as one major form among many, contrasting it especially with mature [[Aggressiveness|aggression]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornstein, in Cooper ed., pp. 451–52&lt;/ref&gt; Because the very structure of the self itself is weakened in the narcissist, their rage cannot flower into real [[assertiveness]];&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, "Introduction", Cooper, ed., p. xxxiv&lt;/ref&gt; and they are left instead prone to oversensitivity to perceived or imagined narcissistic injuries resulting in narcissistic rage.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Carlson/Len Sperry, ''The Disordered Couple'' (1998) p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

For Kohut, narcissistic rage is related to narcissists' need for total [[Control freak|control]] of their environment, including "the need for revenge, for righting a wrong, for undoing a hurt by whatever means".&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-514873-8"/&gt; It is an attempt by the narcissist to turn from a passive sense of [[victimization]] to an active role in giving pain to others, while at the same time attempting to rebuild their own (actually false) sense of self-worth. It may also involve self-protection and preservation, with rage serving to restore a sense of safety and power by destroying that which had threatened the narcissist.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-514873-8"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ronningstam, Elsa |title=Identifying and understanding the narcissistic personality |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2005 |pages=86–87 |isbn=0-19-514873-8 |oclc= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=veX1zqgXSmkC&amp;pg=PA86 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, according to Kohut, rages can be seen as a result of the [[shame]] at being faced with failure.&lt;ref name = "kohut"&gt;{{cite book|last = Kohut | first = Heinz  |authorlink = |coauthors = |title = Thoughts on narcissism and narcissistic rage. In The search for the self |publisher = International Universities Press  | year = 1972  | location =   | pages =  615–58  | url =   | doi =   | id = Vol. 2  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Narcissistic rage is the uncontrollable and unexpected anger that results from a narcissistic injury – a threat to a narcissist's [[self-esteem]] or worth. Rage comes in many forms, but all pertain to the same important thing: [[revenge]]. Narcissistic rages are based on fear and will endure even after the threat is gone.&lt;ref name="Golomb1992"&gt;{{cite book |last=Golomb |first=Elan |title=Trapped in the Mirror: Adult Children of Narcissists in their Struggle for Self |publisher=Harper Collins |year=1992 |location=New York |isbn=0-688-14071-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the narcissist, the rage is directed towards the person that they feel has slighted them; to other people, the rage is incoherent and unjust. This rage [[cognitive distortion|impairs their cognition]], therefore impairing their [[judgment]].  During the rage they are prone to shouting, fact distortion and making [[False accusations|groundless accusations]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, David (2010). Narcissism: Behind the Mask&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''The Analysis of the Self'', Kohut explains that expressions caused by a sense of things not going the expected way blossom into rages, and narcissists may even search for conflict to find a way to alleviate their pain or suffering.&lt;ref name = "kohut71"&gt;{{cite book|last = Kohut | first = Heinz  | authorlink =   | coauthors = | title = The analysis of the self: A systematic approach to the psychoanalytic treatment of narcissistic personality disorders. | publisher = Perspectives |year = 1971 |location = |pages = |url = |doi =  |id = |isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perfectionism==

Narcissists are often [[perfectionism (psychology)|pseudo-perfectionists]] and create situations in which they are  the center of attention.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} The narcissist's attempts at being seen as perfect are necessary for their grandiose [[self-image]]. If a perceived state of perfection is not reached, it can lead to [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[shame]], [[anger]] or [[anxiety]] because the subject believes that they will lose the admiration and love from other people if they are imperfect.&lt;ref name="Sorotzkin2005"&gt;{{cite web|last =Sorotzkin|first =Benzion|authorlink =|coauthors =|title =The Quest for Perfection: Avoiding Guilt or avoiding shame?|publisher =Psychology Today|date =18 Apr 2006|location =|pages =|url =http://www.drsorotzkin.com/quest_for_perfection.html|doi =|id =|isbn =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080309214032/http://www.drsorotzkin.com/quest_for_perfection.html|archivedate =2008-03-09|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind such  perfectionism, [[self psychology]] would see earlier traumatic injuries to the [[Grandiosity|grandiose self]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold M. Cooper, "Introduction"  in Arnold M. Cooper ed., ''Contemporary Psychoanalysis in America'' (2006) p. xxxiv&lt;/ref&gt;

==In therapy==

[[Adam Phillips (psychologist)|Adam Phillips]] has argued that, contrary to what common sense might expect, therapeutic cure involves the patient being encouraged to re-experience "a terrible narcissistic wound" – the child's experience of exclusion by the parental alliance – in order to come to terms with, and learn again, the diminishing loss of omnipotence entailed by the basic "facts of life".&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''The Beast in the Nursery'' (1998) pp. 99–110&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Wide dissemination of Kohut's concepts may at times have led to their trivialization. [[Neville Symington]] points out that "You will often hear people say, 'Oh, I'm very narcissistic,' or, 'It was a wound to my narcissism.' Such comments are not a true recognition of the condition; they are throw-away lines. Really to recognise narcissism in oneself is profoundly distressing and often associated with denial."&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==

The lead character of ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' has been considered as exhibiting narcissistic rage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burgo|first=Joseph|title=Narcissistic Rage and the Failure of Empathy: 'Citizen Kane'|url=http://www.afterpsychotherapy.com/citizen-kane/|publisher=After Psychotherapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Space for Women’s Health''', a project of the [[Friends of the Birth Center]], is building an independent women's health and birth center in midtown [[Manhattan]] in early 2010 to provide an alternative center for women to receive health care and give birth in a respectful, attentive and private environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
The Friends of the Birth Center began with a group of midwives, nurses, families and other supporters that gathered in 2003 after the closing of the [[Elizabeth-Seton Childbearing Center]], which was based in [[Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center|St. Vincent's Hospital]]. Skyrocketing malpractice insurance forced the center to close its doors with little warning to the staff and to the devastation of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its closure, Manhattan has been left without a birth center, a truly ironic tragedy since Manhattan was the home of first birth center in the United States, the Childbearing Center opened by the [[Maternity Center Association]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Elizabeth Seton Childbearing Center opened in St. Vincent's after the Childbearing Center closed in 1996.

The New Space for Women's Health is no longer a registered [[501(c)|501(c)(3) nonprofit organization]] in New York City, its doors were closed in February 2010.

==Philosophy==
Previously the facility's About Us page described how the foundation uses the Midwives Model of Care, which is based on the premise that when fully informed, women should be trusted to make responsible choices about their health.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
All women and their newborn babies deserve the best, and we are designing a center specifically to meet the needs of women and their families. The New Space for Women’s Health will be a powerful catalyst for improving the quality of health care for all women in New York City. We are giving the choice back to women in a time when families are being restricted in their decisions in how they can have their children. We avoid the routine use of tests, procedures, drugs, and restrictions, and give evidence-based care solely in the interest of mothers and infants, not at the convenience of the provider.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"The American healthcare system is increasingly dependent upon medical interventions to address what is, most often, a normal and safe physiological process," says Rebecca Benghiat, executive director of the New Space for Women’s Health. "Women are demanding a change and corporations are looking for a more financially viable model. The New Space is both of those, safe and empowering and economically feasible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

These plans have been canceled in light of the fact that NSWH closed its doors in February 2010.

The [[Republic of Panama]] is one of the oldest and best-known tax havens in [[the Caribbean]], as well as one of the most established in the region.&lt;ref name=Maverick&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maverick|first1=J. B.|title=Why Is Panama Considered a Tax Haven?|url=http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/093015/why-panama-considered-tax-haven.asp|accessdate=May 5, 2016|work=Investopedia|date=September 30, 2015|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panama has had a reputation for [[tax avoidance]] since the early [[20th century]], and Panama has been cited repeatedly in recent years as a jurisdiction which does not cooperate with international tax transparency initiatives.

Panama's offshore sector is intimately tied to the [[Panama canal]], which has made it a gateway and ''entrepôt'' for international trade.&lt;ref name="PanamaTJN" /&gt; There are strong similarities between Panama and other leading tax havens like Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai. On paper at least, Panama has the largest shipping fleet in the world, greater than those of the US and China combined, according to the [[Tax Justice Network]].

==Background (1910s–1970s)==
[[File:Panama Canal under construction, 1907.jpg|thumb|Construction work on the [[Gaillard Cut]] of the [[Panama Canal]], 1907]]
A 2014 investigation by journalist [[Ken Silverstein]] published in ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice Magazine]]'' explains how Panama came into being, with US help:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1903, the administration of Theodore Roosevelt created the country after bullying Colombia to hand over what was then the province of Panama. Roosevelt acted at the behest of various banking groups, among them [[J. P. Morgan &amp; Co.]], which was appointed as the country's official "fiscal agent".&lt;ref name=Silverstein /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An operation{{which|date=July 2016}} approved by the [[Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt|Roosevelt administration]] sought to foment armed rebellion, forcing Panama away from Colombia, then politically fragile. Roosevelt achieved this goal with the help of [[William Nelson Cromwell]], a well-connected US Republican lawyer and also legal counsel for JP Morgan's railroad interests. The administration's key objective was allegedly to install a pro-US Panamanian government that would secure US rights over the [[Panama Canal]].&lt;ref name="Diaz-Espino2014"&gt;
{{cite book|author=Ovidio Diaz-Espino

|page=120
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty]] resulted, establishing permanent U.S. rights to a [[Panama Canal Zone]] several miles wide, across the neck of the isthmus. Panama became independent from Colombia the same month, and the Panama Canal opened in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2013 academic study published by the Norwegian Center for Taxation, Panama's reputation as a [[tax haven]] began in the year 1919, when it began registering foreign ships in order to help [[Standard Oil]] avoid US taxes and regulations; other US ship owners followed, some seeking to avoid the higher wages and better working conditions imposed by US legislation such as the Seaman's Act and safety standards for sea vessels.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Also, during the [[Prohibition era]], US passenger ships were allowed to serve alcohol to their customers without breaking the law if they had Panamanian registration.&lt;ref name="Armando Jose Garcia Pires"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few years, Panama extended its minimalist approach to taxation, regulation and financial disclosure requirements to the world of [[offshore finance]]. According to the study, "Wall Street interests helped Panama introduce lax company incorporation laws, which let anyone start tax-free, anonymous corporations, with few questions asked".&lt;ref name="Armando Jose Garcia Pires" /&gt;

==Background (1970s–present)==
For decades, offshore finance had a relatively modest profile in Panama, but it took off in the 1970s as world oil prices surged. During this time, the Republic of Panama passed legislation "entrenching corporate and individual financial secrecy".&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;
{{cite news
|title=Panama Papers: How did Panama become a tax haven?
|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-35967590
|work=BBC News
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1982, partly attracted by business opportunities deriving from the Panama Canal and its free trade zone, more than 100 international banks had offices in Panama City.&lt;ref name="BBC1" /&gt;

According to ''[[Investopedia]]'': "Panama's offshore jurisdiction offers a wide array of excellent financial services, including offshore banking, the incorporation of offshore companies, registration of ships and the formation of Panama trusts and foundations."&lt;ref name=Maverick /&gt; In Panama, no taxes are imposed on offshore companies which engage in business solely outside of the jurisdiction; therefore, the companies which are incorporated in the Republic of Panama and the owners of these companies are exempt from [[corporate taxes]], [[withholding tax]]es, [[capital gains tax]], [[local taxes]], [[estate taxes]] and [[inheritance tax]]. However, businesses within Panama itself are permitted to conduct business there so long as the company pays its local taxes.&lt;ref name=Maverick /&gt;

Panama has been cited repeatedly in recent years by the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] of the [[United States]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) as a jurisdiction which does not cooperate with international tax transparency initiatives due to the legislation which regulates the country's offshore jurisdiction and financial services.&lt;ref&gt;Panama as a jurisdiction which does not cooperate with international tax transparency initiatives:

Alongside incorporation of IBCs, Panama is active in forming tax-evading foundations and trusts, insurance, and boat and shipping registration, according to the [[Tax Justice Network]].&lt;ref name="PanamaTJN" /&gt;

===Financial privacy===
[[File:Countries implicated in the Panama Papers.svg|thumb |325px |right |Countries with politicians, public officials or close associates implicated in the [[Panama Papers]] leak on April 15, 2016]]

An extensive amount of legislation currently exists in the Republic of Panama to protect corporate and financial privacy. However, organisations such as the [[Tax Justice Network]] and other [[advocacy groups]] and [[non-governmental organisations]] state that the main intention of these laws is financial secrecy, as opposed to privacy.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The names of [[shareholders]] of Panamanian corporations, trusts and foundations are still not required by law to be publicly registered. Panama has no [[exchange controls]]: this means that for individual clients of Panama's offshore banking, as well as for offshore business entities incorporated in Panama, there are no limits or reporting requirements on money transfers into or out of the country.&lt;ref name=Maverick /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC1" /&gt;

Panama also has very strict banking secrecy laws: for example, it is forbidden for Panamanian banks to share any information about offshore bank accounts or account holders, except under special circumstances instigated by the Panamanian authorities. Such regulation has made it difficult to investigate the true extent of the [[Panama Papers]] leak, as severe criminal penalties are enacted to individuals who breach confidentiality.&lt;ref name=Maverick /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC1" /&gt;

Despite this, Panama does not appear on the [[Tax Justice Network]]'s top ten list for financial secrecy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=View 2015 Results|url=http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/introduction/fsi-2015-results|website=Financial Secrecy Index|publisher=Tax Justice Network|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208055612/http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/introduction/fsi-2015-results|archivedate=2015-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Alex Cobham of Tax Justice Network saying "There is a double standard: many developed countries host or support jurisdictions where there is an absence of financial transparency".&lt;ref name="BBC top 10"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Seitz|first1=Max|title=Why the top 10 tax havens don't include Panama|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35998801|work=BBC Mundo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Manuel Noriega]], commander of the [[Panamanian Public Forces#The Panamanian Defense Forces|Panama Defence Forces]], took power in Panama in 1983, Silverstein said, Noriega essentially nationalised the money-laundering business; he partnered with the [[Medellín Cartel|Medellin drug cartel]] and gave it free rein to operate in the country."&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Silverstein&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], ''[[Private Eye]]'' used data collected from the [[Land Registry]] to create "an easily searchable online map ... of properties in England and Wales owned by offshore companies. It reveals for the first time the extent of the British property interests held by companies based in tax havens." Most of these properties are tax avoidance vehicles and in some cases also to conceal wealth of dubious origin."&lt;ref&gt;

A 2003 examination of tax havens by [[Jeffrey Robinson]] quotes a US Customs official as saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Panama] is filled with dishonest lawyers, dishonest bankers, dishonest company formation agents and dishonest companies registered there by those dishonest lawyers so that they can deposit dirty money into their dishonest banks. The [[Colon Free Trade Zone|Free Trade Zone]] is the black hole through which Panama has become one of the filthiest money laundering sinks in the world.&lt;ref name="ConversationPanama"&gt;

The [[advocacy group]] the [[Tax Justice Network]] has described [[Panama]] as "the recipient of drugs money from Latin America, plus ample other sources of dirty money from the US and elsewhere".&lt;ref name="ConversationPanama" /&gt; It said "now is a good moment to draw attention to how Panama developed as a secrecy jurisdiction and how it continues to provide full service – wash, rinse and dry – to crooks and money launderers from around the world."&lt;ref name="ConversationPanama" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Darwin's Pangenesis.svg|thumb|upright=2|[[Charles Darwin]]'s pangenesis theory postulated that every part of the body emits tiny particles called gemmules which migrate to the [[gonad]]s and are transferred to offspring.

The theory implied that changes to the body during an organism's life would be inherited, as proposed in [[Lamarckism]].]]

'''Pangenesis''' was [[Charles Darwin]]'s hypothetical mechanism for [[heredity]], in which he proposed that each part of the body continually emitted its own type of small organic particles called '''gemmules''' that aggregated in the [[gonad]]s, contributing heritable information to the [[gamete]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holterhoff, Kate |date=2014 |title=The History and Reception of Charles Darwin's Hypothesis of Pangenesis |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |volume=47 |pages=661–695 |doi=10.1007/s10739-014-9377-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He presented this 'provisional hypothesis' in his 1868 work ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'', intending it to fill what he perceived as a major gap in evolutionary theory at the time. The etymology of the word comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''pan'' (a prefix meaning "whole", "encompassing") and ''genesis'' ("birth") or ''genos'' ("origin"). Pangenesis mirrored ideas originally formulated by [[Hippocrates]] and other pre-Darwinian scientists, but built off of new concepts such as [[cell theory]], explaining cell development as beginning with gemmules which were specified to be necessary for the occurrence of new growths in an organism, both in initial development and regeneration.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Charles Darwin: A Scientific Biography|last=de Beer|first=Gavin|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company|year=1965|isbn=|location=Garden City, New York|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also accounted for [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] and the [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] concept of the inheritance of acquired characteristics, as a body part altered by the environment would produce altered gemmules. This made Pangenesis popular among the neo-Lamarckian school of evolutionary thought.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This hypothesis was made effectively obsolete after the 1900 rediscovery among [[biologist]]s of [[Gregor Mendel]]'s theory of the [[Mendelian inheritance|particulate nature of inheritance]].

==Early history==

Pangenesis was similar to ideas put forth by [[Hippocrates]], [[Democritus]] and other pre-Darwinian scientists in proposing that the whole of parental organisms participate in heredity (thus the prefix ''pan'').&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zirkle | first1 = Conway | authorlink = Conway Zirkle | year = 1935 | title = The Inheritance of Acquired Characters and the Provisional Hypothesis of Pangenesis | url = | journal = [[The American Naturalist]] | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 417–445 | doi=10.1086/280617}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin wrote that Hippocrates' pangenesis was "almost identical with mine—merely a change of terms—and an application of them to classes of facts necessarily unknown to the old philosopher."&lt;ref name="Deichmann 2010"&gt;Deichmann, Ute. (2010). ''Darwinism, Philosophy, and Experimental Biology''. Springer. pp. 41-42. {{ISBN|978-90-481-9901-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science historian [[Conway Zirkle]] wrote that:

{{quote|The hypothesis of pangenesis is as old as the belief in the inheritance of acquired characters. It was endorsed by [[Hippocrates]], [[Democritus]], [[Galen]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Lactantius]], [[St. Isidore of Seville]], [[Bartholomeus Anglicus]], [[St. Albert the Great]], [[St. Thomas of Aquinas]], [[Pietro de' Crescenzi|Peter of Crescentius]], [[Paracelsus]], [[Jerome Cardan]], [[Levinus Lemnius]], [[Nicolas Venette|Venette]], [[John Ray]], [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]], [[Charles Bonnet|Bonnet]], [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertius]], [[Albrecht von Haller|von Haller]] and [[Herbert Spencer]].&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Zirkle demonstrated that the idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics had become fully accepted by the 16th century and remained immensely popular through to the time of Lamarck's work, at which point it began to draw more criticism due to lack of hard evidence.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt; He also stated that pangenesis was the only scientific explanation ever offered for this concept, developing from Hippocrates' belief that "the semen was derived from the whole body."&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt; In the 13th century, pangenesis was commonly accepted on the principle that semen was a refined version of food unused by the body, which eventually translated to 15th and 16th century widespread use of pangenetic principles in medical literature, especially in gynecology.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt; Later pre-Darwinian important applications of the idea included hypotheses about the origin of the differentiation of races.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt;

A theory put forth by [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] in 1745 called for particles from both parents governing the attributes of the child, although some historians have called his remarks on the subject cursory and vague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mayr, Ernst |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |date=1981 |title=The Growth of Biological Thought |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0674364462 |pages=328, 646}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Charles Darwin: A Scientific Biography|last=de Beer|first=Gavin|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company|year=1965|isbn=|location=Garden City, New York|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1749, French naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] developed a hypothetical system of heredity much like Darwin's pangenesis, wherein 'organic molecules' were transferred to offspring during reproduction and stored in the body during development.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hull, David L. (1988). ''Science as a Process: An Evolutionary Account of the Social and Conceptual Development of Science''. University of Chicago Press. p. 86. {{ISBN|0-226-36051-2}} "As Darwin was to discover many years later, Buffon had devised a system of heredity not all that different from his own theory of pangenesis."&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on Buffon's views, Darwin stated, "If Buffon had assumed that his organic molecules had been formed by each separate unit throughout the body, his view and mine would have been very closely similar."&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935"/&gt;

In 1801, [[Erasmus Darwin]] advocated a hypothesis of pangenesis in the third edition of his book ''[[Zoonomia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Deichmann, Ute. (2010). ''Darwinism, Philosophy, and Experimental Biology''. Springer. p. 42. {{ISBN|978-90-481-9901-3}} "Among the other authors were Buffon, who proposes "organic molecules" with affinities to various organs, and, in particular, Erasmus Darwin, who in 1801 anticipated his grandson's concept of pangenesis, suggesting that small particles were given off by parts of the bodies of both parents; and that they are circulated in the blood, ending in the sexual organs from where they could be combined during reproduction in order to form the nucleus of an offspring."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1809, [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] in his ''[[Philosophie Zoologique]]'' put forth evidence for the idea that characteristics acquired during the lifetime of an organism, either from effects of the environment or  may be passed on to the offspring.  Charles Darwin first had significant contact with [[Lamarckism]] during his time at the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]] in the late 1820s, both through [[Robert Edmond Grant]], whom he assisted in research, and in Erasmus's journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Browne|first1=E.

In 1861, Irish physician [[Henry Freke]] developed a variant of pangenesis in his book ''Origin of Species by Means of Organic Affinity''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Macalister|Macalister, Alexander]]. (1870). ''Reviews and Bibliographical Notices''. In ''[[Irish Journal of Medical Science|Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medical Science]], Volume 50''. Fannin and Company. p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Freke proposed that all life was developed from microscopic organic agents which he named ''granules'', which existed as 'distinct species of organizing matter' and would develop into different biological structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a944AAAAMAAJ&amp;rdid=book-a944AAAAMAAJ&amp;rdot=1|title=On the origin of species by means of organic affinity|last=Freke|first=Henry|date=1861|publisher=Longman and Co.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, four years before the publication of ''Variation'', [[Herbert Spencer]] in his book ''Principles of Biology'' proposed a theory of "physiological units" similar to Darwin's gemmules, which likewise were said to be related to specific body parts and responsible for the transmission of characteristics of those body parts to offspring.&lt;ref name="Deichmann 2010"/&gt; He also supported the [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] idea of transmission of acquired characteristics.

Darwin had debated whether to publish a theory of heredity for an extended period of time due to its highly speculative nature. He decided to include pangenesis in ''Variation'' after sending a 30 page manuscript to his close friend and supporter [[Thomas Huxley]] in May 1865, which was met by significant criticism from Huxley that made Darwin even more hesitant.&lt;ref name="Geison69" /&gt; However, Huxley eventually advised Darwin to publish, writing: "Somebody rummaging among your papers half a century hence will find Pangenesis &amp; say 'See this wonderful anticipation of our modern Theories—and that stupid ass, Huxley, prevented his publishing them'"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url= http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-4875.html | title = Letter 4875 – Huxley, T. H. to Darwin, C. R., 16 July (1865) | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's initial version of pangenesis appeared in the first edition of ''Variation'' in 1868, and was later reworked for the publication of a second edition in 1875.

==Theory==

=== Darwin ===
Darwin's pangenesis theory attempted to explain the process of [[sexual reproduction]], inheritance of traits, and complex [[developmental biology|developmental]] phenomena such as cellular [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] in a unified mechanistic structure.&lt;ref name="Geison69"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Geison | first1=G.

When passed on to offspring via the reproductive process, gemmules were thought to be responsible for developing into each part of an organism and expressing characteristics inherited from both parents.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Darwin thought this to occur in a literal sense: he explained cell proliferation to progress as gemmules to bind to more developed cells of their same character and mature. In this sense, the uniqueness of each individual would be due to their unique mixture of their parents’ gemmules, and therefore characters.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Similarity to one parent over the other could be explained by a quantitative superiority of one parent's gemmules.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Yongsheng|date=May 2008|title=A new perspective on Darwin’s Pangenesis|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-185X.2008.00036.x|journal=Biological Reviews|language=en|volume=83|issue=2|pages=141–149|doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.2008.00036.x|issn=1464-7931|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yongshen Lu points out that Darwin knew of cells' ability to multiply by self-division, so it is unclear how Darwin supposed the two proliferation mechanisms to relate to each other.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He did clarify in a later statement that he had always supposed gemmules to only bind to and proliferate from developing cells, not mature ones.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-6442.xml;query=gemmule;brand=default|title=To Scientific Opinion|last=Darwin|first=Charles|date=October 20, 1869|work=Darwin Correspondence Project|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin hypothesized that gemmules might be able to survive and multiply outside of the body in a letter to J.

[[File:Gemmule cell proliferation (pangenesis).jpg|thumb|right|350px|Darwin's description of cell proliferation using pangenesis theory in ''The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication'']]

Some gemmules were thought to remain dormant for generations, whereas others were routinely expressed by all offspring. Every child was built up from selective expression of the mixture of the parents and grandparents' gemmules coming from either side. Darwin likened this to gardening: a flowerbed could be sprinkled with seeds "most of which soon germinate, some lie for a period dormant, whilst others perish."{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=276}} He did not claim gemmules were in the blood, although his theory was often interpreted in this way. Responding to [[Fleming Jenkin]]'s review of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', he argued that pangenesis would permit the preservation of some favourable variations in a population so that they wouldn't die out through blending.{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=283}}

Darwin thought that environmental effects that caused altered characteristics would lead to altered gemmules for the affected body part. The altered gemmules would then have a chance of being transferred to offspring, since they were assumed to be produced throughout an organisms life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus, pangenesis theory allowed for the Lamarckian idea of transmission of characteristics acquired through use and disuse. Accidental gemmule development in incorrect parts of the body could explain deformations and the 'monstrosities' Darwin cited in ''Variation''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== De Vries ===
[[Hugo de Vries]] characterized his own version of pangenesis theory in his 1889 book ''Intracellular Pangenesis'' with two propositions, of which he only accepted the first:

:I. In the cells there are numberless particles which differ from each other, and represent the individual cells, organs, functions and qualities of the whole individual. These particles are much larger than the chemical molecules and smaller than the smallest known organisms; yet they are for the most part comparable to the latter, because, like them, they can divide and multiply through nutrition and growth. They are transmitted, during cell-division, to the daughter-cells: this is the ordinary process of heredity.
:II. In addition to this, the cells of the organism, at every stage of development, throw off such particles, which are conducted to the germ-cells and transmit to them those characters which the respective cells may have acquired during development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Vries|first=Hugo|title=Intracellular Pangenesis|url=http://www.esp.org/books/devries/pangenesis/facsimile/|accessdate=May 2, 2015|date=1910|origyear=1889|page=63|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Vries also coined the term 'pangene' which 20 years later was shortened by [[Wilhelm Johannsen]] to [[gene]].

=== Other variants ===
Science historian [[E. Janet Browne|Janet Browne]] points out that while [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Carl von Nägeli]] also put forth ideas for systems of inheritance involving gemmules, their version of gemmules differed in that it contained "a complete microscopic blueprint for an entire creature."{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=281}} Spencer published his theory of "physiological units" three years prior to Darwin's publication of ''Variation''.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt;

She goes on to say that Darwin believed specifically in gemmules for each body part because they might explain how environmental effects could be passed on as characteristics to offspring.{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=281}}

Interpretations and applications of pangenesis continued to appear frequently in medical literature up until [[August Weismann|Weismann's]] experiments and subsequent publication on germ-plasm theory in 1892.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt; For instance, an address by Huxley spurred on substantial work by Dr. James Ross in linking ideas found in Darwin's pangenesis to the [[germ theory of disease]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Graft Theory of Disease: Being an Application of Mr. Darwin's Hypothesis of Pangenesis to the Explanation of the Phenomena of the Zymotic Diseases|last=Ross|first=James|publisher=Lindsay and Blakiston|year=1872|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross cites the work of both Darwin and Spencer as key to his application of pangenetic theory.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Collapse ==

=== Galton's experiments on rabbits ===
Darwin's half-cousin [[Francis Galton]] conducted wide-ranging inquiries into heredity which led him to refute Charles Darwin's hypothetical theory of pangenesis. In consultation with Darwin, he set out to see if gemmules were transported in the blood.  In a long series of experiments from 1869 to 1871, he transfused the blood between dissimilar breeds of rabbits, and examined the features of their offspring. He found no evidence of characters transmitted in the transfused blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bulmer|2003|pp=116–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Galton|Galton]] was troubled because he began the work in good faith, intending to prove Darwin right, and having praised pangenesis in ''Hereditary Genius'' in 1869. Cautiously, he criticized his cousin’s theory, although qualifying his remarks by saying that Darwin's gemmules, which he called "pangenes," might be temporary inhabitants of the blood that his experiments had failed to pick up.{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=291–292}}

Darwin challenged the validity of Galton's experiment, giving his reasons in an article published in ''Nature'' where he wrote:&lt;ref name=Darwin1871&gt;{{cite journal |author=Darwin, Charles R. |authorlink=Charles Darwin |date=27 April 1871 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1751&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=1 |title=Pangenesis |journal=Nature. A Weekly Illustrated Journal of Science |volume=3 |pages=502–503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Now, in the chapter on Pangenesis in my ''Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,'' I have not said one word about the blood, or about any fluid proper to any circulating system. It is, indeed, obvious that the presence of gemmules in the blood can form no necessary part of my hypothesis; for I refer in illustration of it to the lowest animals, such as the Protozoa, which do not possess blood or any vessels; and I refer to plants in which the fluid, when present in the vessels, cannot be considered as true blood." He goes on to admit: "Nevertheless, when I first heard of Mr. Galton's experiments, I did not sufficiently reflect on the subject, and saw not the difficulty of believing in the presence of gemmules in the blood.&lt;ref name=Darwin1871/&gt;}}

After the circulation of Galton's results, the perception of pangenesis quickly changed to severe skepticism if not outright disbelief.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Weismann ===
[[File:Weismann's Germ Plasm.svg|thumb|[[August Weismann]]'s [[germ plasm]] theory. The hereditary material, the germ plasm, is confined to the gonads. Somatic cells (of the body) develop afresh in each generation from the germ plasm. The implied [[Weismann barrier]] between the germ line and the soma prevents Lamarckian inheritance.|270x270px]]

[[August Weismann]]'s idea, set out in his 1892 book ''Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung'' (The Germ Plasm: a Theory of Inheritance),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/book/show/weismann_keimplasma_1892|title=Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung|author=Weismann, August|date=1892|publisher=Fischer|location=Jena|trans-title=The Germ Plasm: A theory of inheritance}}&lt;/ref&gt; was that the hereditary material, which he called the [[germ plasm]], and the rest of the body (the [[Somatic (biology)|soma]]) had a one-way relationship: the germ-plasm formed the body, but the body did not influence the germ-plasm, except indirectly in its participation in a population subject to natural selection. This distinction is commonly referred to as the [[Weismann barrier|Weismann Barrier]]. If correct, this made Darwin's pangenesis wrong and Lamarckian inheritance impossible. His experiment on mice, cutting off their tails and showing that their offspring had normal tails across multiple generations, was proposed as a proof of the non-existence of Lamarckian inheritance, although Peter Gauthier has argued that [[Weismann's experiment]] showed only that injury did not affect the germ plasm and neglected to test the effect of Lamarckian use and disuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gauthier|first=Peter|date=March–May 1990|title=Does Weismann's Experiment Constitute a Refutation of the Lamarckian Hypothesis?|journal=BIOS|volume=61|pages=6–8|jstor=4608123|number=1/2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weismann argued strongly and dogmatically for Darwinism and against neo-Lamarckism, polarising opinions among other scientists.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40193707|title=Neo-Lamarckism and the evolution controversy in France, 1870-1920|last=1940-|first=Persell, Stuart Michael,|date=1999|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|isbn=077348275X|location=Lewiston, NY|oclc=40193707}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increased anti-Darwinian feeling, contributing to [[Eclipse of Darwinism|its eclipse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolution: The History of an Idea|last=Bowler|first=Peter J.|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-520-23693-6|edition=3rd completely rev. and expanded|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=253–256|authorlink=Peter J.

Darwin's pangenesis theory was widely criticised, in part for its [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] premise that parents could [[inheritance of acquired characters|pass on traits acquired]] in their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Yongsheng|last2=Li|first2=Xiuju|date=2014-09-23|title=Has Darwin's Pangenesis Been Rediscovered?|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/64/11/1037/2754242|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=64|issue=11|pages=1037–1041|doi=10.1093/biosci/biu151|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the neo-Lamarckians of the time seized upon pangenesis as evidence to support their case.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Italian Botanist Federico Delpino's objection that gemmules' ability to self-divide is contrary to their supposedly innate nature gained considerable traction; however, Darwin was dismissive of this criticism, remarking that the particulate agents of small pox and scarlet fever seem to have such characteristics.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Lamarckism fell from favour after [[August Weismann]]'s research in the 1880s indicated that changes from use (such as lifting weights to increase muscle mass) and disuse (such as being lazy and becoming weak) were not heritable.&lt;ref name="ImaginaryLamarck"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.textbookleague.org/ |title=The Textbook Letter |last=Ghiselin |first=Michael T. |publisher=The Textbook League |publication-date=September–October 1994 |contribution=Nonsense in schoolbooks: 'The Imaginary Lamarck' |authorlink=Michael Ghiselin |accessdate=2008-01-23 |contribution-url=http://www.textbookleague.org/54marck.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q |title=A History of the Life Sciences |last=Magner |first=Lois N. |publisher=[[Marcel Dekker]], [[CRC Press]] |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-203-91100-6 |edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scientists continued to voice their support  in spite of Galton's and Weismann's results: notably, in 1900 Karl Pearson wrote that pangenesis "is no more disproved by the statement that ‘gemmules have not been found in the blood,’ than the atomic theory is disproved by the fact that no atoms have been found in the air."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=PSwRAwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=The+Grammar+of+Science&amp;ots=T5EHpFM1SO&amp;sig=1AasXoTNJ_snuqbDZwDknU7ilks#v=snippet&amp;q=atomic%20theory&amp;f=false|title=The Grammar of Science|last=Pearson|first=Karl|publisher=Adam and Charles Black|year=1900|isbn=9785877362529|location=London|pages=335|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the rediscovery of Mendel's Laws of Inheritance in 1900 led to pangenesis being fully set aside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Beer|first1=Gavin|title=Charles Darwin: A Scientific Biography|date=1965|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company|location=Garden City, NY|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julian Huxley has observed that the later discovery of [[chromosome]]s and the research of [[T. H. Morgan]] also made pangenesis untenable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heredity East and West: Lysenko and World Science|last=Huxley|first=Julian|publisher=Henry Schuman|year=1949|isbn=|location=New York|pages=11, 141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Darwin's pangenesis principles do relate to heritable aspects of [[phenotypic plasticity]], although the status of gemmules as a distinct class of organic particles has been firmly rejected. However, starting in the 1950s, many research groups in revisiting Galton's experiments found that heritable characteristics could indeed arise in rabbits and chickens following DNA injection or blood transfusion.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Yongsheng|date=2008|title=A new perspective on Darwin's Pangenesis|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-185X.2008.00036.x|journal=Biological Reviews|volume=83|issue=2|pages=141–149|doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.2008.00036.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of research originated in the Soviet Union in the late 1940's in the work of Sopikov and others, and was later corroborated by researchers in Switzerland as it was being further developed by the Soviet scientists.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kosin, I.

Darwin himself had noted that "the existence of free gemmules is a gratuitous assumption"; by some accounts in modern interpretation, gemmules may be considered a prescient mix of DNA, RNA, proteins, prions, and other mobile elements that are heritable in a non-Mendelian manner at the molecular level.&lt;ref name="Geison69" /&gt;&lt;ref name="West=Eberhard08"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=West-Eberhard |first1=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10797">There have been several designs for a '''[[peace]] flag'''.

== The Peace Flag initiative ==
"The Peace Flag" is an initiative that aims to unify all nations underneath one common symbol on [[International Day of Peace|International Peace Day]].
While there are various icons of peace – the olive branch, the dove – there is no official world flag of peace adopted by the [[United Nations]]. That’s why this initiative has proposed that, for one day a year on 21 September, every country raises an all-white version of their national flag to represent that we are all one. In 2013, embassies of Colombia, Equatorial Guinea and Ecuador in London officially agreed to support The Peace Flag initiative by raising a colorless version of their respective flags on September 21. The initiative was nominated for a White Pencil in 2012 at [[D&amp;AD]] for its contribution towards peace, in support of Peace One Day.

== White-bordered national flag ==
[[File:Peace to All Nations.jpg|thumb|left|White-bordered US flag. Banner reads "Peace to All Nations".]]
The [[white flag]] is recognized in most of the world as a flag of surrender, truce or ceasefire. The first mention of a white flag used in this context is made during the Eastern Han dynasty (AD 25–220). A white flag was also used by the anti-war movement during the [[US Civil War]] in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7t_an-gkYa4C&amp;pg=PA251&amp;dq=%22Peace+Flag%22|title=The American Annual Cyclopedia and Register of Important Events of the Year|date=30 April 1864|publisher=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XS0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA230|title=Struggles and Triumphs: Or, Sixty Years' Recollections of P.T. Barnum, Including His Golden Rules for Money-making|first=Phineas Taylor|last=Barnum|date=30 April 1889|publisher=Courier Company|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, the third [[Peace congress#Universal Peace Congress|Universal Peace Congress]] in Rome devised a generalized Peace Flag design, which was simply the home nation's flag bordered in white to signify non-violent conflict resolution. This was used (although not officially adopted) by the [[American Peace Society]]&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=btwBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq="Peace+Flag" US advocate of peace]''&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Universal Peace Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09wBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA113|title=The Advocate of Peace|date=30 April 1894|publisher=American Peace Society|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed by Henry Pettit.&lt;ref name="Devere Allen 1930. p.553"/&gt;

== The International Council of Women's banner ==
[[File:1904 Peace Flag.jpg|thumb|right|Button depicting the peace flag]]
In the 1890s, expatriate American Cora Slocomb di Brazza Savorgnan, the Countess Di Brazza, invented a universal peace flag with three upright bands: yellow, purple, and white, which became the peace flag of the [[International Peace Bureau]].&lt;ref name="Devere Allen 1930. p.553"&gt;Devere Allen, ed., The Fight for Peace (New York: Macmillan, 1930), 553, [https://www.questia.com/read/886957 ].&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, there was a complicated symbol on the middle band: "a shield ... surmounted by a man's and a woman's clasped hands, sustained by a pair of dove wings with a white star aloft; on the shield can appear any device chosen by the association adopting the flag, or simply the number of enrollment among the users of the flag, or the motto ''Pro Concordia Labor'' (For Peace I Work), or this motto may be placed upon a ribbon on the flag beneath the shield, or on a streamer (white) from the flag staff (blue, the color of promise) surmounted by a star with the motto of the association or individual using the flag upon the other white streamer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-IIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA315|title=History and Minutes of the National Council of Women of the United States, Organized in Washington, D.C., March 31, 1888|first=National Council of Women of the United|last=States|date=30 April 1898|publisher=E.B. Stillings|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This flag was adopted by the [[International Council of Women]] in 1896. In 1904, it lost the complicated design and became a simple tricolor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCqyJyiwW7MC&amp;pg=PA476|title=School Arts|date=30 April 2018|publisher=Davis Publications|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Earth flag ==
[[File:Peace Congress flag.svg|thumb|The Universal Peace Congress' world peace flag.]]
{{See also|Flag of the Earth}}
James William van Kirk, a Methodist minister from Youngstown (Ohio, USA), designed the first world peace [[flag of the Earth]], using rainbow stripes, stars and a globe. In 1913 and 1929, he made a peace tour through Europe with his flag.&lt;ref&gt;Corien Glaudemans, 'Een vredesapostel uit Ohio', in: ''Den Haag Centraal'', 16 oktober 2009; for pictures of James William van Kirk and his peace flag, see [http://www.haagsebeeldbank.nl/ Haagse Beeldbank; photocollection of the Municipal Archive of The Hague (the Netherlands)] nrs. 1.02811 and 5.12996.&lt;/ref&gt; He traveled around the world arguing for "the brotherhood of man and the Fatherhood of God".&lt;ref&gt;"How One Minister Paid His Way Round The World". ''The Western Christian Advocate''. C. Holliday and J.F. Wright, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Universal Peace Congress eventually came to adopt Kirk's flag as its official World Peace Flag, and it was subsequently adopted by the American Peace Society as well as other groups. It consisted of "the earth on a blue field covered with white stars; a white band crossed the globe and to the left was broken up into a spectrum representing the variations of the human race — different, but united in peace".&lt;ref name="Devere Allen 1930. p.553"/&gt;

In 1938, Kirk authored an autobiography, ''Stranger than fiction : four times around the world, designer of world flag, a world builder, at 80 years makes a new start in life''.

== The Banner of Peace ==
{{main|Banner of Peace}}
[[File:Pax cultura.svg|thumb|140px|Banner of Peace sign]]
The ''banner of peace'' is a symbol of the [[Roerich Pact]]. This pact was the first international treaty dedicated to the protection of artistic and scientific institutions and historical monuments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscbs.org/1935-roerich-pact.html Roerich Pact: Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments]&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed on April 15, 1935. The banner of peace was proposed by [[Nicholas Roerich]] for an international pact for the protection of culture values.

== The Rainbow flag ==
[[File:PACE-flag.svg|thumb|220px|The actual rainbow colors in the PACE flag ([[Italian language|Italian]] for '[[peace]]')]]
The most common recent design is a [[rainbow flag]] representing peace, first used in [[Italy]] at a [[peace march]] in 1961. The flag was inspired by similar multi-coloured flags used in demonstrations against [[nuclear weapon]]s. A previous version had featured a dove drawn by [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elettrosmog.com/bandieradellapace.htm|title=La vera storia della bandiera della pace - Notizie storiche sulla  bandiera della Pace, la bandiera Arcobaleno della Pace|first=|last=A.E.|website=www.elettrosmog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common variety has seven colours — [[purple]], [[blue]], [[azure (color)|azure]], [[green]], [[yellow]], [[orange (color)|orange]], and [[red]] — and is emblazoned in bold with the [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''PACE'', meaning "peace".

It became popular with the ''Pace da tutti i balconi'' ("peace from every balcony") campaign in 2002, started as a protest against the impending war in the world. The flag was flown from balconies in all Italian [[city|cities]] by citizens against the war. Its use spread to other countries too, and the Italian ''Pace'' was sometimes, but not everywhere, replaced with the corresponding translation in the local languages.

According to [[Amnesty International]], producer [[Franco Belsito]] had produced about 1,000 flags per year for 18 years, and suddenly had to cope with a demand in the range of the millions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnesty.no/aktuelt/flere-nyheter/arkiv-reportasjer/det-nytter-1 'Det nytter!'], Amnesty International Norway&lt;/ref&gt;

Common variations include moving the purple stripe down below the azure one, and adding a white stripe on top.

The seven-color peace flag is not to be confused with the similar six-color [[Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|gay pride flag]], which does not have [[azure (color)|azure]] (it has [[Turquoise (color)|turquoise]]) and the colors are in opposite order: with red at the top.

[[Robert A. Heinlein]], in his 1947 short story ''[[The Green Hills of Earth]]'', referred to "Terra's [Earth's] rainbow banner".

=== The largest peace flag ===
[[File:MegaPeaceFlag.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Large peace flag in Lecce, 14 November 2009]]
The first large peace flag was made in [[Lecce]], [[Salento]], Italy by the association "GPace - Youth for peace" on Saturday, 14 November 2009. It was 21 m wide and 40 m long. Three years later this record was broken. On September the 21st 2012 the Belgian Peace Organisation [http://www.vrede.be/ Vrede vzw], Vredeshuis Ghent and five city schools unfolded the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VzXEtQN8x4 worlds largest peace flag] (30 m wide and 50 m long) in the historic center of [[Ghent]]. The action aimed to reinforce the demand to disarm in order to make room for sustainable development.

==History==
Computer art started in 1960s and by its nature is evolutionary since changes in technology and software directly affect what is possible. The term ''pixel art'' was first published by Adele Goldberg and Robert Flegal of Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Adele Goldberg and Robert Flegal, "ACM president's letter: Pixel Art", ''Communications of the ACM'', Vol. 25, Issue 12, Dec. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adobe Systems]], founded in 1982, developed the Postscript language and digital fonts, making drawing painting and image manipulation software popular.&lt;ref name="Art of the Digital Age"/&gt; [[Adobe Illustrator]], a vector drawing program based on the [[Bezier curve]], was introduced in 1987 and [[Adobe Photoshop]] followed in 1990.&lt;ref name="Art of the Digital Age"&gt;Wands, Bruce. (2006) Art of the Digital Age, Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-23817-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adobe Flash]], a popular set of [[multimedia]] software used to add [[animation]] and [[interactivity]] to web pages, was introduced in 1996.

In the 2000s, pixel artists have been employed increasingly in video games and, to a lesser extent in music videos. These artists have remained somewhat underground until the mid-2000s.&lt;ref name="Art, One Click at a Time"&gt;{{cite web

==Techniques==
[[File:Plaque rue du Cirque à Paris.JPG|thumb|left|160px|Pixel art outside the virtual domain using mosaic tiles by [[Invader (artist)|Invader]]]]
[[File:ReconstructionsFromPixels.png|right|frame|A pixel does not need to be rendered as a small square.  This image shows alternative ways of reconstructing an image from a set of pixel values, using dots, lines, or smooth filtering.]]

The total number of pixels (''[[image resolution]]''), and the amount of information in each pixel (often called ''[[color depth]]'') determine the quality of an image.  For example, an image that stores 24 bits of color-information per pixel (the standard for computer displays since around 1995) can represent smoother degrees of shading than one that only stores 16 bits per pixel, but not as smooth as one that stores 48 bits.  Likewise, an image [[sample (graphics)|sample]]d at 640 x 480 pixels (and therefore containing 307,200 pixels) will look rough and blocky compared to one sampled at 1280 x 1024 (1,310,720 pixels). Because it takes a large amount of data to store a high-quality image, computer software often uses [[data compression]] techniques to reduce this size for images stored on disk. Some techniques sacrifice information, and therefore image quality, in order to achieve a smaller file-size. Computer scientists refer to [[image compression|compression techniques]] that lose information as [[lossy compression]].

Modern computer-monitors typically display about 72 to 130 [[pixels per inch]] (PPI), and some modern consumer printers can resolve 2400 [[dots per inch]] (DPI) or more; determining the most appropriate image resolution for a given printer-resolution can pose difficulties, since printed output may have a greater level of detail than a viewer can discern on a monitor.  Typically, a resolution of 150 to 300 pixel per inch works well for 4-color process ([[CMYK]]) printing.
Drawings usually start with what is called the [[line art]], which is the basic line that defines the item the artist intends to create. Line arts can be either traced over [[image scanner|scanned]] drawings or hand drawn on the computer itself by the use of a [[Computer mouse|mouse]] or a [[graphics tablet]] and are often shared among other pixel artists in diverse websites in order to receive some feedback. Other techniques, some resembling [[painting]], also exist, such as knowledge of the [[color theory]]. The limited palette often implemented into [[pixel art]] usually promotes the use of [[dithering]] in order to achieve different shades and colors (when necessary); hand-made [[Spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliasing]] is also used for smoother purposes. A pixel artist will exponentially increase the zoom of whatever they are working on to make adjustments as needed and then view the results until desired changes are achieved.&lt;ref name="Flash Enabled: Fl"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3094">In [[sociology of scientific knowledge]], '''Planck's principle''' is the view that scientific change does not occur because individual scientists change their mind, but rather that successive generations of scientists have different views.

The reason for the name is the statements by [[Max Planck]]:&lt;ref&gt;Planck, Max K. (1950). Scientific Autobiography and Other Papers. New York: Philosophical library.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it|sign=Max Planck|source=Scientific autobiography, 1950, p. 33}}
{{quote|text=An important scientific innovation rarely makes its way by gradually winning over and converting its opponents: it rarely happens that Saul becomes Paul. What does happen is that its opponents gradually die out, and that the growing generation is familiarized with the ideas from the beginning: another instance of the fact that the future lies with the youth.|sign=Max Planck|source=Scientific autobiography, 1950, p. 97}}

Planck's quote has been used by [[Thomas Kuhn]], [[Paul Feyerabend]] and others to argue that [[scientific revolutions]] are arational, rather than spreading through "mere force of truth and fact".&lt;ref name="Hull"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hull DL, Tessner PD, Diamond AM |title=Planck's Principle |journal=Science |date=17 November 1978 |volume=202 |issue=4369 |pages=717–23 |doi=10.1126/science.202.4369.717}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.

Graff Zivin: Does Science Advance One Funeral at a Time? 2015, {{doi|10.3386/w21788}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as [[Darwinian]] rather than [[Lamarckian]] conceptual evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=John T.

Whether age influences the readiness to accept new ideas has been empirically criticised. In the case of acceptance of [[evolution]] in the years after Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' age was a minor factor.&lt;ref name="Hull"/&gt; Similarly, it was a weak factor in accepting [[cliometrics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arthur M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25438">'''Reciprocal altruism in humans''' refers to an individual behavior that gives benefit conditionally upon receiving a returned benefit, which draws on the economic concept – ″gains in trade″.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Cosmides, L. &amp; Tooby, J. (1992). Cognitive adaptations for social exchange. In Barkow, J., Cosmides, L. &amp; Tooby, J. (ed.), ''The adapted mind: Evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture'' (pp. 163-228). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Human reciprocal altruism would include the following behaviors (but is not limited to): helping patients, the wounded, and the others when they are in crisis; sharing food, implement, knowledge.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Trivers, L. R. (1971). The evolution of Reciprocal Altruism. ''The Quarterly Review of Biology'', 46(1), pp. 35-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The concept of ″altruism″ was firstly coined by the French philosopher Auguete Comte in the 19th century, which was derived from the French word ″''altruisme''″.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Comte believed that ″altruism″ is a moral doctrine, which is the opposite of egoism, emphasizing the noble morality of sacrificing themselves and benefiting others. Human beings have both selfish and altruistic motivations, and altruism is used to restrain the egoistical instinct.&lt;ref&gt;Comte, A. (1858). ''The catechism of positive religion''. London: John Chapman Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Comte’s altruism describes the nature of human and ethical significances, but it’s completely different from the altruism in biological sciences. In evolutionary biology, altruism is an individual behavior that benefits another individual’s fitness but reduces their own fitness in population&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham, B. (2008). ''Selection: the mechanism of evolution''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 367-368.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of ″altruism″ in biology arose from the debate of ″the Problem of Altruism″ in Natural Selection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Charles Darwin suggested that animals behave in the ways that can increase their survival and reproductive chances while competing with others. However, altruistic behavior – the act of helping others even if it accompanies with a personal cost – is common in the animal kingdom, like the Vampire Bat&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, G. (1988). Reciprocal Altruism in bats and other mammals. ''Ethology and Sociobiology''. 9 (2–4): pp. 85–100.&lt;/ref&gt; and pariousrprimates.&lt;ref&gt;Seyfarth, R. M. &amp; Cheney, D. L. (1984). Grooming, alliances and reciprocal altruism in vervet monkeys. ''Nature''. 308 (5959): pp. 541–543.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Charles Darwin regarded ″the Problem of Altruism″ as a potential fatal challenge to his concept of natural selection. In ″The Descent of Man″, Darwin (1859) wrote:&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Darwin, C. (1859). ''On the origin of species by means of Natural Selection''. London: John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|1=He who was ready to sacrifice his life, as many a savage has been, rather than betray his comrades, would often leave no offspring to inherit his noble nature.}}

In 1964, William Hamilton&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Hamilton, D. W. (1964). The genetic evolution of social behavior, I and II. ''Journal of Theoretical Biology'', 7, pp. 1-52.&lt;/ref&gt; developed mathematical model and put forward to his theory – ″Kin selection″ theory or ″Inclusive fitness″ theory. ″Kin selection″ theory or ″Inclusive fitness″ theory reveals that an altruistic gene evolved by natural selection. The gene can be only shared with relatives, and reduces the individuals own fitness but boots the fitness of their relatives and off-springs. In this way, this behavior increases the proportion of altruistic gene in population. Hamilton’s rule provides mathematical inequality to state that an altruistic gene spread by natural selection only if the following condition can be satisfied: r B &gt; C, where C is the cost to the individual performing the altruistic act, B is the benefit gained by the recipients of the altruistic act, r is the genetic relatedness between individual and recipients.

Hamilton's &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; ″Kin selection″ theory or ″Inclusive fitness″ theory expands the Darwinian definition of ″fitness″ and continues the same Darwinian framework that allows the spread of not only selfish genes but also altruistic genes. Nevertheless, Hamilton’s theory did not support an appropriate explanation with unrelated members of other species. In order to solve this problem, Robert Trivers &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; developed the original theory of reciprocal altruism into an attempt to explain the altruism behaviors among unrelated organisms. The idea of reciprocal altruism is straightforward: an altruistic behavior is probably selected only if a return would be obtained in the future. It is similar to the Tit-for-Tat strategy &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; from the game theory explained later in the paper.

The theory of reciprocal altruism in humanity, based on the biological characteristics of human beings and the realistic society, explicates the interdependence and cooperation between people, as well as its rationality. It also demonstrates the original motivations and the internal mechanisms of the human cooperation, revealing the inevitability and social significance ranging from kin altruism to un-relative altruism in the human population. As a result, the subjective guess and emotion of human cooperation can be refined to a theory, and is gradually become one of the most popular explanations to a variety of social behaviors. In addition, cooperation is the most deep-seated foundation for the formation and existence of human society. Therefore, the proposition of reciprocal altruism is undoubtedly a great theoretical advance in human cognition history.

Human reciprocal altruism seems to be a huge magnetic field to interweave different disciplines closely. New exploration has been made by these disciplines at different levels from different points. Generally, the core of Human reciprocal altruism is located in the puzzle: How to overcome short-term self-interest and achieve cooperation. Ultimately, it reveals that altruistic individuals are more competitive than selfish individuals, on either improving individual fitness or resolving conflicts. The compatibility and complementarity of different theoretical perspectives lay the basis of human reciprocal altruism, and help with exploring human different viewpoints of human reciprocal altruism. The debate of human reciprocal altruism has been the focus of biology, sociology, economics and culture.

== Scientific viewpoints==

=== Biology===
In 1902, Peter Kropotkin&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, P. (1902). ''Mutual aid: a factor of evolution''. New York: Alfred A. Knope.&lt;/ref&gt; published his monograph – ''Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution'', and demonstrates the survival mechanisms of cooperation, based on various examplesm of animal and human societies. He attempted to reveal that the law of biological evolution is mutual aid rather than survival competition. Mutual aid and cooperation are the principles of all species’ biological evolution including human beings’, and the concepts resulting in a profound influence upon biological evolution. Wilson&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E. O. (1975). ''Sociobiology: the new synthesis''. New York: Harvard University press.&lt;/ref&gt; applied the term of ″sociobiology″ as an attempt to explain social behavior of insect and thus explored the evolutionary mechanism of other animals including human such as the social behavior, altruism. He argued that human altruistic behavior, as one of the human nature characteristics, is the result of the genetic inheritance.

In 1971, Trivers published one of the most important biological articles of the 20th century -  ''The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism'' &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and introduced the term of ″reciprocal altruism″ to explain the evolution of cooperation. The idea of reciprocal altruism is almost the same as kin selection, except to put emphasis on reciprocation instead of the need for genetic relatedness. It described that an altruistic trait or behavior may be selected, because the recipient will very likely to return benefits to the altruistic sender. If the reproductive benefit that the altruistic sender receives in return is larger than the cost initially incurred by the altruistic action, individuals who engage in this kind of reciprocal altruism will outbreed those who do not. Therefore, a seemingly altruistic trait can spread in a population. The reciprocation can be delayed as long as the individuals stay in the trade, and, so to speak, have sufficient long-term memory. This explains many features of human social life, for example, we do a favor for someone with the expectation that the favor would be remembered, and lead to a return in the future.

As Trivers supported the foundation for reciprocal altruism, Axelrod and Hamilton &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Axelrod, R. &amp; Hamilton, W. D. (1981). The evolution of cooperation. ''Science'', 211, pp. 1390-1396.&lt;/ref&gt; applied the Game Theory to study the mechanism of reciprocal altruism, and attempted to answer the key question: How altruism spreads when cheating is an all-win strategy used by members of the population. In this paper, Axelrod and Hamilton &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; revealed that reciprocating the assistance from another individual is stable in evolution as long as there are enough altruists in the population.  They also demonstrate that a population of altruists can initially emerge through inclusive fitness, helping and receiving help among genetically related individuals. Subsequent work indicates that only a few altruists are initially needed for the emergence of reciprocation in a heterogeneous population.&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, M. &amp; Sigmund, K. (1992). Tit for Tat in heterogeneous population. ''Nature'', 355, pp.250–253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some evolutionary biologists, like Richard Dawkins, wholly endorse Axelrod and Hamilton’s work in individual selection. In describing genes as being selfish, Dawkins&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Dawkins, R. (1976). ''The selfish gene''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; states that the organisms act altruistically against their individual interests in order to help copies of themselves in other bodies to replicate. Essentially, reciprocal altruism is the individual behavior behind selfish motivations. The bird is a prime example in the narrative of Dawkins:&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; those altruistic birds who sacrifice their own interests by reproducing late or less during hard times would not have been able to pass their altruistic genes to the future generations, which will be dominated by the selfish genes from birds who take advantage of the situation by using up others’ food supply to reproduce their own offspring. Nevertheless, some scholars such as K. Lorenz and W. Edwards have been strongly opposed to the individual selection. In contrast, they spearhead the campaign of group selection.

The debate whether individuals/gene or group/species are the basic level/unit of selection has occurred since the 1960s. The major idea of group selection is that individuals may sacrifice their own reproductive interests for the benefit of the survival of the group to which they belong. W. Edwards&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, W. V. C. (1962). ''Animal dispersion in relation to social behavior''. Edinburgh: Oliver and Boyd.&lt;/ref&gt; builds this argument mainly on birth related behaviors of birds. He points out that many bird species with small clutches have prolonged periods before reaching reproductive maturity, and have long breeding seasons sometimes in excess of one year. Other group selection supporters also argue that these behaviors must be social and altruistic in that, for example, when food supply is abundant, clutches are bigger than when food supply is more scarce. Birds thus can regulate their population densities below starvation levels through social conventions. All of these characteristics run contrary to the idea that fitness is defined by individual organisms attempting to selfishly reproduce. However, it soon became clear that group selection was losing the battle. In 1966, George Williams&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, G. C. (1966). ''Adaptation and natural selection: a critique of some current evolutionary thought''. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; published the influential ''Adaptation and Natural'' ''Selection: a critique of some current evolutionary thought''. By the end of the 1960s, a Neo-Darwinian interpretation of the modern synthesis had taken hold and it has become almost a gold standard that the unit of evolutionary analysis is at the individual's and the gene’s level. Dawkins, Hamilton, and Trivers represent the mainstream view of individual selection.

=== Sociology===
Some scholars, such as Michael Taylor, Anatol Rapoport, Robert Keohane, Arthur Stein, Helen Milner and Kennth Oye, point out that reciprocal altruism widely spread in international relations and human society, and international reciprocity is the foundation of the international community. States act in the confidence that their cooperative actions will be repaid in the long term instead of seeking for the immediate benefit, so reciprocal altruism can be seen as generally accepted standards in international relations.&lt;ref&gt;Keohane, R. O. (1986). Reciprocity in international relations. ''International Organization'', 40(1), pp. 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt; On a personal scale, some scholars believe that reciprocal altruism derives from the subjective feeling of individuals and compliance with social rules. Smith put forward an alternative based on the idea of sympathy and indicates that altruistic behavior is the product of the measure of gains and losses, emphasizing that people are easy to compare with others when measuring the gains and losses. Due to this, the subjective sense of fairness exerts an effect on people's altruistic behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Khalil, E. L. (2001). Adam Smith and three theories of altruism. ''Louvain Economic Review'', 67(4), pp.421-435.&lt;/ref&gt; For humans, social norms can be argued to reduce individual level variation and competition, thus shifting selection to the group level, so human behavior should be consistent with social norms.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, D. S. &amp; Wilson, E. O. (2008). Evolution ″for the good of the group″. ''American Scientist'', 96 (5): pp. 380–389.&lt;/ref&gt; Altruistic behavior is the result of learning and internalizing these social norms by individuals.

=== Economy===

==== Economic model ====
The economic model of reciprocal altruism includes direct reciprocity and indirect reciprocity. Direct reciprocity is an immediate collaborative exchange that benefits everyone. Direct reciprocity was introduced by Robert Trivers&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ) as a mechanism for the evolution of cooperation. The direct reciprocal is typically one-for-one: I incur the cost today to benefit you, you incur the cost at some point later on to benefit me. There is little negotiation and the exchange is simple. The strategy of ″the prisoner dilemma″ is the common direct reciprocity.

The Prisoners Dilemma requires that:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

:temptation to defect (T=+5) &gt; reward for mutual cooperation(R=+3) &gt; being a sucker (S=-2)

and that:

:reward for mutual cooperation (R=+3) &gt; (T+S)/2.

There is immediate and obvious benefit from direct reciprocity and relatively little need for trust into the future. Cheating is a critical question and may happen at some time.

In the context of Indirect reciprocity, two players are randomly selected in a population, one is donor while the other is recipient. Each player can play many times, but never with the same partner twice. Thus it is impossible that a cheat is held to account by the victim. Obviously, trigger strategies can ensure a cooperative Nash equilibrium. If all players use these strategies, no player would have deviated.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Nowak, M. &amp; Sigmund, K. (2005). Evolution of indirect reciprocity. ''Nature'', 437, pp.1291-1298.&lt;/ref&gt; In many situations, cooperation is favored and it even benefits an individual to forgive a defection but cooperative societies are always unstable because mutants which are inclined to defect may lose any balance.&lt;ref&gt;Tbomas, R. (2012). Does it pay to be nice? – the math of altruism. Retrieved from April 23, 2017:&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Indirect reciprocity typifies two forms: ″Upstream reciprocity″ and ″Downstream reciprocity″.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the description of "Figure1. Direct and indirect reciprocity", Nowak and Sigmund provided the explicit identifications of ″Upstream reciprocity″ and ″Downstream reciprocity″:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Upstream reciprocity is based on a recent positive experience. A person who has been at the receiving end of a donation may feel motivated to donate in turn. Individual B, who has just received help from A, goes on to help C. ‘Downstream reciprocity’ is built on reputation. Individual A has helped B and therefore receives help from C. Mathematical investigations of indirect reciprocity have shown that natural selection can favor strategies that help others based on their reputation. Upstream reciprocity is harder to understand but is observed in economic experiments. In both cases, the decision to help can be interpreted as a misdirected act of gratitude. In one case recipients are thanked for what another did; in the other case they are thanked by someone who did not profit by what they did".(p.&amp;nbsp;1292.)

==== Utility function====
Utility function&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/072915/what-utility-function-and-how-it-calculated.asp|title=utility Function|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an important concept in economy that measures preferences over a set of goods and services using mathematics. In general, a utility function U (X, Y) will represent a consumer’s preferences for different goods if the following condition holds:

:U(A) &gt; U(B) if and only if A is preferred to B.

Economists, such as Gary S. Becker, use the theory of utility function and establish the hypothesis of altruism model. Becker&lt;ref&gt;Becker, S. G. (1976). ''The economic approach to human behavior''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the donor's utility function includes the utility of potential recipients. That is, the donor would donate a resource if the vicarious enjoyment of watching the pleasure of others exceeds at the margin the donor's satisfaction from consuming the resource himself. He indicates that all human behaviors are the maximization of different utility functions, and attempts to establish all human behaviors on the basis of generalized utility theory with resource constraints. He also puts the human irrational behavior into the framework of this analysis, emphasizing that human altruistic behavior can be defined by the generalized utility function appropriately.

==== Game theory====
Game theory, especially the prisoner’s dilemma, is originally introduced by Trivers&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; to explain the mechanism of reciprocal altruism. Unlike Hamilton’s inclusive fitness where the selection of an altruistic allele is ″secured″ by the extent of genetic relatedness between the donor and recipient, reciprocation is no guarantee and, in fact, cheating or not reciprocating is evolutionarily stable because cheaters are doubly rewarded reproductively. That is, they receive a benefit from helpers and, at the same time, helpers bear a cost for the cheaters, although the cost is smaller than the benefit.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Smith, J. M. (1982). ''Evolution and the theory of games. Cambridge'': Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The relationship between donor and recipient in reciprocal altruism is exactly analogous to the situation of the prisoner’s dilemma. In Triver’s narrative,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the prisoner’s dilemma can be characterized by the following payoff matrix:
{| class="wikitable"
|
|A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|R, R
|S, T
|-
|C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|T, S
|P, P
|}

Where A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the individuals’ altruistic acts and C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the cheating acts, and where T represents the temptation to defect, R represents the reward for mutual cooperation and S stands for being a sucker.

And the following inequality must hold for reciprocal altruism:

:S &lt; P &lt; R &lt; T.

The Prisoner's dilemma becomes the classical example to understand the reciprocal altruism. Combining the theory of biological evolution with classical game theory, Maynard Smith&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; and George. R. Price explained how selfish individuals can achieve cooperation and develop the basic equilibrium concept in evolutionary - Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS). Evolutionarily Stable Strategy is a strategy and adopted by a population in a given environment. An ESS is an equilibrium refinement of the Nash equilibrium that once it is fixed in a population, natural selection alone is sufficient to prevent alternative strategies from invading successfully. Simultaneously, the collaboration between Axelrod and Hamilton is also significant for applying game theory to evolutionary issues. Their paper&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and the book ''Evolution and the theory'' ''of games'',&lt;ref&gt;Maynard, J. (1982). ''Evolution and the theory'' ''of games.'' London: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; written by John Maynard, illustrate that the process of natural selection can be mathematically modeled using game theory. In essence, natural selection entails differential replication of genes. That is, different traits and attributes are selected for or against because of the different effects they have on their ″own″ genetic reproduction or replication. The differential replication process, independent of its underlying nature being biological, physiological, or psychological, can be approximated by game theory. Different game-theoretical strategies have imbedded probabilistic functions that result in their winning or losing a game, similar to the selecting - for or selecting - against of genes.

The strategy of game theory discussed in Axelrod and Hamilton's paper&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; is called Tit for Tat. Tit for Tat represents such a strategy that, in a repeated game, the player starts by not telling on the other player or cooperates and subsequently reciprocates the same action undertaken by the other player. That is, the player cooperates if the other player cooperates and defects if the other player defects. As a game theoretical strategy, Tit for Tat essentially entails the same concept as Trivers' reciprocal altruism. Unlike Trivers' original publication which provides conceptual explanations and examples, Axelrod and Hamilton's paper provides more rigorous mathematical proofs of the viability or ESS of reciprocal altruism.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, L. R. (2002). ''Natural selection and social theory: Selected papers of Robert Trivers''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reciprocal altruism has since become one of the major theoretical foundations of evolutionary psychology and game theory, and the repeated prisoner's dilemma game has also become popular tools by which to derive and test evolutionary psychological concepts. Social interactions similar in form to Tit for Tat are prevalent in our daily lives. When someone does you a favor, you feel you owe that person. If you fail to return the favor, you are likely to feel guilty and may try to find ways to overcompensate for your friend. Generally, when you do favors for another person, you are also likely to expect something in return. When that person fails to reciprocate, you may feel cheated and may seek revenge by not being generous to the person in the future. On the other hand, when someone gives you a large gift for which you did not do anything, you may feel uncomfortable and even resentful because you do not want to owe the person a debt. These behaviors and emotions that have clearly been selected for are consistent with the Tit for Tat game theoretical strategy and reciprocal altruism.

=== Culture ===
D. S. Wilson and E. O. Wilson&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, D. S. &amp; Wilson, E. O. (2007). Rethinking the theoretical foundation of sociobiology. ''The Quarterly Review of Biology'', 82(4), pp. 327-348.&lt;/ref&gt; stated that the speed and function of "gene evolution" in human society is far less than that of "cultural evolution", but these two elements interact, thus they achieve the evolution of human altruism. To further illustrate this mechanism, Dawkins&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; proposed the concept of ″Meme″ in his book ''The selfish gene.'' ″Meme″{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} refers to ″an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture″. It is seen as the basic unit of culture that can be transmitted from one mind to another. Susan Blackmore is one of the scholars that has made contributions to the theory of ″Meme″. Blackmore&lt;ref&gt;Blackmore, S. (1999). ''The Meme machine''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; insisted that memes are the medium of the spread of altruism. The transmission of altruism has been carried out through memes. Memes are true evolutionary replicators like genetics and undergo evolutionary change.

{{emotion}}
'''Remorse''' is a distressing emotion experienced by a person who [[regret (emotion)|regrets]] actions which they deem to be [[shameful]], hurtful, or violent. Remorse is closely allied to [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and self-directed [[resentment]]. When a person regrets an earlier action or failure to act, it may be because of remorse or in response to various other consequences, including being punished for the act or omission.  People may express remorse through apologies, trying to repair the damage they've caused, or self-imposed punishments.

In a legal context, the perceived remorse of an offender is assessed by Western justice systems during trials, sentencing, parole hearings, and in [[restorative justice]]. However, there are [[epistemological]] problems with assessing an offender's level of remorse.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=91|publisher=Nw. U. L. Rev.|pages=1507|date=1996–1997|title=Remorse, Cooperation, and Acceptance of Responsibility: The Structure, Implementation, and Reform of Section 3E1.1 of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines|author=O'Hear, Michael M.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/illlr91&amp;section=51|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218101826/http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals%2Filllr91&amp;section=51|archivedate=2013-12-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who is incapable of feeling remorse is often diagnosed with [[antisocial personality disorder]], as characterized in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM IV-TR]]. In general, a person needs to be unable to feel [[fear]], as well as remorse, in order to develop [[psychopathic]] traits. Legal and business professions such as insurance have done research on the expression of remorse via apologies, primarily because of the potential litigation and financial implications.

==Studies on apologizing==
Two studies on apologising are "The Five Languages of Apology" by Gary Chapman and Jennifer Thomas&lt;ref&gt;Gary Chapman, Jennifer Thomas (2006). The Five Languages of Apology. Moody. {{ISBN|1-881273-57-1}}. See also Gary Chapman (2007). Now You're Speaking My Language: Honest Communication And Deeper Intimacy For A Stronger Marriage. B&amp;H. {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4460-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and "On Apology" by Aaron Lazare.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Lazare (2004). On Apology. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-1951-7343-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These studies indicate that effective apologies that express remorse typically include a detailed account of the offense; acknowledgment of the hurt or damage done; acceptance of the responsibility for, and ownership of, the act or omission; an explanation that recognises one's role. As well, apologies usually include a statement or expression of regret, humility, or remorse; a request for [[forgiveness]]; and an expression of a credible commitment to change or a promise that it will not happen again. Apologies may also include some form of restitution, compensation or token gesture in line with the damage that one has caused. [[John Kleefeld]] has encapsulated this into "four Rs" that typically make for a fully effective apology: remorse, responsibility, resolution and reparation.&lt;ref&gt;John Kleefeld (2007). "Thinking Like a Human: British Columbia's ''Apology Act''" University of British Columbia Law Review '''40''' (2): 769–808, 790. http://ssrn.com/abstract=1937545.&lt;/ref&gt; When an apology is delayed, for instance if a friend has been wronged and the offending party does not apologise, the perception of the offense can compound over time. This is sometimes known as compounding remorse. Compunction refers to the act of actively expressing remorse, usually requiring the remorseful individual to physically approach the person to whom he is expressing regret.

==Falsified expressions==
In a study led by Leanne ten Brinke, a professor at the [[University of British Columbia]], participants' genuine and falsified emotions were studied to investigate behavioral and facial cues. Brinke and others found a significant difference in the presence of facial expressions in real and false remorse. With falsified emotions of remorse, they found that the participants experienced a greater range of emotions, which are close to genuine feelings, while deceptive descriptions of remorse were associated with positive emotions, such as happiness and surprise.&lt;ref name=Brinke&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Brinke| first1 = L,| last2 = MacDonald| first2 = S,| last3 = O'Connor| first3 = B,| last4 = Porter| first4 = S| display-authors = 2| title = Crocodile tears: Facial, Verbal and Body Language Behaviours Associated With Genuine and Fabricated Remorse| journal = Law and Human Behavior| volume = 36| issue = 1| pages = 51–59| year = 2012| doi = 10.1037/h0093950}}&lt;/ref&gt; The positive emotions felt by participants demonstrating a deceptive description of remorse are likely due to the leakage of genuine feelings from incomplete deception. Brinke and others established that participants appeared surprised because they could only raise their eyebrows when trying to appear sad, which then caused the participants to feel embarrassed, feel genuine happiness, and let a smile slip.&lt;ref name=Brinke/&gt; In contrast to deceptive and falsified accounts, genuine accounts were expressed with fewer emotions. Participants showing deceptive or falsified emotions overcompensated their emotional performance. Genuine negative feelings of remorse leaked by the lower face were immediately covered up with a neutral expression. Brinke recorded a small number of body language and verbal cues for deceptive participants; instead, she recorded a large number of speech hesitations that cued deceptive and falsified accounts of remorse.&lt;ref name=Brinke/&gt; Current findings about deceptive and falsified remorse have practical use for measuring veracity of remorseful displays for judges, jurors, parole officers, and psychologists when sentencing offenders.

==Psychopathy==
{{Main|Psychopathy}}
Psychopathic individuals are best known for their flagrant disregard for [[social norm|social]] and moral norms. Psychopaths have dysfunctional [[interpersonal relationship|personal relationships]], characterized by violence, [[Sexual exploitation|exploitation]], and [[promiscuity|philandering]]. Emotionally, they are incapable of feeling [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] or empathy, they respond abnormally to [[fear]] and pain, and other emotions are shallow compared to population norms.&lt;ref name=Maibom&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Maibom| first1 = H,| title = Moral Unreason: The Case of Psychopathy| journal = Mind and Language| volume = 20| issue = 2| pages = 237–257| year = 2005| doi = 10.1111/j.0268-1064.2005.00284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychopaths refuse to adopt social and moral norms because they are not swayed by the emotions, such as guilt, remorse, or fear of retribution, that influence other human beings.&lt;ref name=Maibom/&gt;

As human beings, we hold dear to the value of remorse. The lack of remorse leads us to all believe a person to be despicable. It is widely accepted that remorse is the proper reaction to any misconduct. Remorse may originate in from either actual or contrived regret for the misconduct that results in getting caught or causing harm.&lt;ref name=MacLin&gt;{{Citation| last1 = MacLin| first1 = M,| last2 = Downs| first2 = C,| last3 = MacLin| first3 = O,| last4 = Caspers| first4 = H| display-authors = 2| title = The Effect of Defendant Facial Expression on Mock Juror Decision-Making: The Power of Remorse | journal = North American Journal of Psychology| volume = 11| issue = 2| pages = 323–332| year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that the facial expressions of offenders on trial affect the jury's attitude and, in turn, the sentencing decision. While remorse may present guilt that may influence a jury's decision, a lack of remorse influences the jury even more because it is one trait of psychopathy.

Psychopathy represents a configuration of traits that are missing within a person's personality, such as a lack of [[empathy]] and remorse. Knowledge of psychopathic traits has been shown to affect how jurors perceive adult and juvenile offenders.  Assessments of psychopathy are introduced to direct a relatively wide variety of questions in the legal system, so investigators have started examining the effects of psychopathy evidences.&lt;ref name=Edens&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Edens| first1 = J,| last2 = Davis| first2 = K,| last3 = Smith| first3 = K,| last4 = Guy| first4 = L| display-authors = 2| title = No Sympathy for the Devil: Attributing Psychopathic Traits to Capital Murderers Also Predicts Support for Executing Them| journal = Personality Disorders: Theory, Research, and Treatment| volume = 1| issue = 2| year = 2012| doi = 10.1037/a0026442| pages=175–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through simulations in studies by John Edens, who is a [[psychology]] professor at [[Texas A&amp;M University]], data suggests that attributing psychopathic traits to adult and juvenile offenders can have a noticeable negative effect on how these individuals are viewed by others.&lt;ref name=Edens/&gt; Remorselessness, a key feature of psychopathy, proves to be a strong predictor of juror attitudes.&lt;ref name=Edens/&gt; In the study by John Edens, a pool of offenders were labeled as either having a "disorder" condition or having "no disorder." Those labeled as "disorder" were given death verdicts by mock jurors.&lt;ref name=Edens/&gt; In the study, traits, such as [[Callous and unemotional traits|callousness]], remorselessness, and [[superficial charm]], were a strong predictor of negative consequences for the offenders. This study found that remorselessness has the largest effect on the mock jurors' opinions of the "disorder" offenders and it explains support for the death sentence.&lt;ref name=Edens/&gt; The results of this study suggest that, free of mental health testimonies, perceptions of a defendant's personality traits may have serious implications in the sentencing decisions of a capital case.&lt;ref name=Edens/&gt;

==Forgiveness==
The perception of remorse is essential to an apology, and the greater the perception of remorse the more effective the apology. An effective apology reduces negative consequences and facilitates cognitive and behavioral changes associated with forgiveness.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Davis| first1 = J,| last2 = Gold| first2 = G,| title = An examination of emotional empathy, attributions of stability, and the link between perceived remorse and forgiveness| journal = Personality and Individual Differences| volume = 50| issue = 3| pages = 392–397| year = 2011| doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2010.10.031}}&lt;/ref&gt; With empathy as the mediator between apologies and forgiveness and remorse as the essential part to an apology, one can expect empathy to mediate perceived remorse forgiveness. Remorse may signal that one is suffering psychologically because of one's negative behavior, which leads to empathy from the victim, who may then express forgiveness.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; In a study by James Davis and Greg Gold, 170 university students filled out questionnaires about forgiveness within interpersonal relationships. Davis and Greg's findings suggest that when a victim perceives an apology to be remorseful then he/she believes the negative behavior will not occur again, and they'll be more willing to forgive them.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;

==Versus self-condemnation==
Remorse is closely linked with the willingness to humble oneself and to repent for one's misdeeds. Remorse is not as such when defined through the view of self-condemnation.&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Exline| first1 = J,| last2 = Fisher| first2 = M,| title = Self-Forgiveness versus Excusing: The Roles of Remorse, Effort, and Acceptance of Responsibility| journal = Self and Identity| volume = 5| pages = 127–46| year = 2006| doi = 10.1080/15298860600586123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-condemnation, more so than remorse, is said to be associated with poor psychological well-being. Remorse captures feelings of guilt, regret, and sorrow. Forgiveness does not eliminate all negative feelings, but it may entail the reduction of bitter  and angry feelings, not feelings of disappointment, regret, or sorrow. A study by Mickie Fisher found that people who forgive themselves for serious offenses may continue to harbor remorse or regret.&lt;ref name=Fisher/&gt; In contrast to remorse, self-condemnation reflects a more global, negative, severe stance toward oneself. Remorse may convey a sense of sorrow, while self-condemnation suggests the kind of loathing and desire for punishment that characterizes interpersonal grudges. Fisher suggests that self-forgiveness does not necessarily require one to get rid of feelings or regret or remorse.&lt;ref name=Fisher/&gt; Based on the study by Fisher, self-forgiveness seems to relate more closely to self-condemnation and not remorse. When trying to convince people to forgive themselves, it is crucial not to erase the potentially adaptive feelings of remorse along with the more destructive self-condemnation.&lt;ref name=Fisher/&gt; People can grow and experience prosocial behaviors once they accept responsibility for their own transgressions. For genuine self-forgiveness, one must first accept responsibility for their offenses and not rush to rid themselves of guilty feelings.

==Buyer's remorse==
{{Main|Buyer's remorse}}
Purchases can be divided into two different categories: material or experiential. A material good is made to be kept in the buyer's possession, while an experiential good provides the buyer with a life experience. A material good provides the buyer with a more enduring pleasure compared with an experiential, as these two purchases also result in different types of regret.&lt;ref name=Gilovich&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Gilovich| first1 = T,| last2 = Rosenzweig| first2 = E,| title = Buyer’s Remorse or Missed Opportunity? Differential Regrets for Material and Experiential Purchases| journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology| volume = 102| issue = 2| pages = 215–223| year = 2012| doi = 10.1037/a0024999| pmid=21843013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While experiential purchases bring about regrets of a missed opportunity, material purchases result in buyer's remorse, which means that a person dwells on how their material purchase measure up to other purchases they could have made and how it compares with other people's purchases. These comparisons diminish satisfaction from the original purpose.&lt;ref name=Gilovich/&gt; Past research explains that regrets of action are intense, but only in the short term, while regrets of inaction gains intensity over time and dominates people's experience. Major life choices, such as marriage, jobs, and education, are often the focus of regret. Everyday experience suggests that everyday decisions are the most frequent causes of regret.&lt;ref name=Gilovich/&gt; Marketing directors know the effects of buyer's remorse, and use it to their advantage when planning marketing strategies. The regret felt over choosing a material over an experiential purchase depends on the pain of the factors underlying the purchase. Based on research by Thomas Gilovich and Emily Rosenzwig, material purchases are more likely to lead to regret, while experiential purchases give the buyer more satisfaction even over time.&lt;ref name=Gilovich/&gt;

'''Safety of journalists''' is the ability for journalists and media professionals to receive, produce and share information without facing physical or moral threats.

Journalists can face violence and intimidation for exercising their fundamental right to freedom of expression. The range of threats they are confronted to include murder, kidnapping, hostage-taking, offline and online harassment, intimidation, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention and torture. [[Women in journalism|Women journalists]] also face specific dangers and are especially vulnerable to sexual assault, "whether in the form of a targeted sexual violation, often in reprisal for their work; mob-related sexual violence aimed against journalists covering public events; or the sexual abuse of journalists in detention or captivity. Many of these crimes are not reported as a result of powerful cultural and professional stigmas."&lt;ref&gt;The United Nations Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and Issues of Impunity, 2012, https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/un-plan-on-safety-journalists_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Increasingly, journalists, and particularly women journalists, are facing abuse and harassment online, such as hate speech, cyber-bullying, cyber-stalking, docking, trolling, public shaming and intimidation and threats.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Violence against journalists==

=== Killings of journalists===
[[File:Journalists killed by year and by region 2012-2016 .jpg|thumb|251x251px|Number of journalists killed by year and region. UNESCO's data, ''World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development 2018.'']]

From 2012 to 2016, [[UNESCO]]’s Director-General condemned the killing of 530 journalists, an average of two deaths per week.&lt;ref&gt;Data on the killings of journalists correspond to those condemned by UNESCO's Director-General, following Resolution 29 adopted by the 29th session of the General Conference. Each year, UNESCO's Director-General sends requests to [[Member states of UNESCO|member states]] asking them to inform the organization of the status of ongoing investigations into the killing of journalists about whom the Director-General has made public statements. UNESCO's statistics related to impunity are based on this data, which is published biennially in the Director-General's report to the IPDC Intergovernmental Council and in alternate years in the World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Report, this data is also found on UNESCO's website: https://en.unesco.org/unesco-condemns-killing-of-journalists&lt;/ref&gt; During the previous five-year period, 2007 to 2011, UNESCO recorded 316 killings. The year 2012 proved to be the deadliest year on record, with 124 journalists killed. The majority of journalists killed between 2012 and 2016&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;See, Time to break the cycle of violence against journalists, highlights from the UNESCO Director-General's 2016 report on the Safety of Journalists and Dangers of Impunity: http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002464/246409e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; occurred in countries experiencing [[War|armed conflict]], representing 56 per cent of overall killings.&lt;ref&gt;Countries were considered to be in armed conflict if listed in the annual reports of the UN Secretary-General on the protection of civilians in armed conflict.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends Report in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002610/261065e.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] (CPJ) nearly 50 per cent of those whose death was confirmed to be related to their work as journalist were murdered, while 36 per cent were caught in the [[crossfire]] and 14 per cent killed while on dangerous assignment.[[Safety of journalists#cite note-6|&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] According to the NGO, political groups were the most likely source of violence (36 per cent) in these killings, followed by military officials (22 per cent) and unknown sources (20 per cent).&lt;ref&gt;Committee to Protect Journalists. 2017. Journalists Killed since 1992. Available at https://www.cpj.org/killed/. Retrieved 8 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Journalists killed by type of media 2012-2016.jpg|thumb|249x249px|Type of media of journalists killed, 2012–2016, ''World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development.'']]
As the reliance on [[Freelancer|freelance journalists]] by news organizations is increasing, a rising proportion of journalists killed have been freelance. UNESCO's study, ''[[World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development]] Global Report 2017/2018'', has found that over the past five years, 113 freelance journalists were killed, representing 21 per cent of the total. Freelance journalists are particularly vulnerable, often working alone on stories, in dangerous environments, and without the same level of assistance and protection as staff-journalists.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Director-General. 2016. The Safety of Journalists and the Danger of Impunity: Report by the Director-General to the Intergovernmental Council of the IPDC (Thirtieth Session). Paris: UNESCO. Available at &lt;en.unesco.org/dg-report/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same period, according to UNESCO data, the number of journalists targeted who work primarily online fluctuated significantly, but accounts for 14 per cent of journalists killed overall. Journalists and crew who work primarily in television experienced the most casualties (166), followed by those mainly working for [[Printing press|print]] (142), radio (118), online (75) and those working across multiple platforms (29).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Terrorism and increasing risks===
Terrorism represents a direct and growing threat for journalists, which has taken the form of kidnappings, executions threats or hacking.&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/09/08/simon.press.freedom.911/&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 1970s, the general policy of welcoming journalists into areas of [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] control changed. Organizations such as the [[Khmer Rouge]] in Cambodia, the [[Red Brigades]] in Italy, the [[Shining Path]] in Peru and the [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]] (GIA) in [[Algeria]] targeted journalists, considering them as the auxiliaries of the powers they were combating, and thus as enemies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Terrorism and the Media. A Handbook for Journalists.|last=Marthoz|first=Jean-Paul|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002470/247074E.pdf|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1993 and 1997, more than 100 journalists and media workers were killed in [[Algeria]]. During the [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975-1990), kidnapping international journalists became a common tactic.&lt;ref&gt;Act for the Disappeared: http://www.actforthedisappeared.com/our-cause/17000-disappeared-lebanon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Brooke, and Reynolds, Amy, Terrorism and The Press. An Uneasy Relationship, Peter Lang, 2009, 208 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] (CPJ), 40% of the journalists murdered in 2015 were killed by groups claiming adherence to [[Islamic extremism|radical Islam]]. International press correspondents, in particular, are considered potential hostages, or sacrificial lambs, whose execution is dramatized to serve terrorist propaganda. This happened to [[James Foley (journalist)|James Foley]], [[Steven Sotloff]] (United States) and [[Kenji Goto]] (Japan), who were beheaded by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Daesh]].&lt;ref&gt;https://cpj.org/blog/2016/06/infographic-islamic-states-assault-on-the-press.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Trauma and the emotional impact of witnessing terrorism is also an issue for journalists, as they may experience [[anxiety]], [[insomnia]], irritation and physical problems such as fatigue or headaches. It can also lead to [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]], which can cause incapacitating feelings of horror, fear and [[Depression (mood)|despair]]. According to the study Eyewitness Media Hub of 2015, 40% of the journalists who were interviewed admitted that viewing video testimonies had had negative effects on their personal life.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eyewitnessmediahub.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[protection of sources]] and surveillance is one of the major issues in the coverage of terrorism in order to protect [[witness]]es and interviewees against [[reprisal]]s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Impunity for crimes against journalists===
There is a continuing trend of [[impunity]] for crimes against journalists, with over 90% of cases of killings of journalists unresolved.The Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression of the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]], Edison Lanza considers impunity as a key obstacle to ensuring journalists' safety.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Frank William La Rue|Frank La Rue]], UNESCO's former Assistant Director-General for [[Information and communications technology|Communication and Information]] considers that its "root cause has to be attributed to lack of political will to pursue investigations, including for fear of reprisals from criminal networks in addition to inadequate [[Legal doctrine|legal frameworks]], a weak [[Judiciary|judicial system]], lack of resources allocated to [[law enforcement]], negligence, and corruption".&lt;ref&gt;La Rue, Frank. 2011. Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. Submission to Human Rights Council. Switzerland: United Nations General Assembly. Available at http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.27_en.pdf. Retrieved 17 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Status of judicial inquiry into killings of journalists, UNESCO 2006-2016.jpg|thumb|248x248px|Status of judicial inquiry into killings of journalists, ''UNESCO's 2018'' ''World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development''.]]
UNESCO has set up a mechanism to monitor the status of judicial enquiries into the killings of journalists. Each year, UNESCO’s Director-General sends a request to [[Member states of UNESCO|Member States]]&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/programme/ipdc/council&lt;/ref&gt; in which killings of journalists have occurred asking them to inform UNESCO of the status of ongoing investigations on each killing condemned by the Organization. UNESCO records the responses to these requests&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; in a public report submitted every two years to the [[International Programme for the Development of Communication]] (IPDC) Council by the Director-General.&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002460/246014E.pdf

https://en.unesco.org/programme/ipdc/initiatives&lt;/ref&gt; The IPDC's 2016 Report is summarized in the "Time to break the cycle of violence against journalists" publication which highlights key findings, provides analysis of the killings, and of Member States responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Time to break the cycle of violence against journalists|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002464/246409e.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, UNESCO sent letters to 62 Member States requesting information on the status of unresolved cases that occurred between 2006 and 2016. Based on Member State responses, the percentage of resolved cases has remained low, at less than 10%. Cumulatively, since UNESCO began requesting information on the judicial follow-up to journalists’ killings condemned by the Director-General, the Organization has received information from 63 out of 75 Member States. The information covers 622 cases out of a total of 930 recorded by UNESCO between 2006 and 2016 (67 per cent).&lt;ref&gt;This represents the status of judicial inquiries as of 9 October 2017 for killings that occurred between 2006 and 2016.

At its 68th session in 2013, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted resolution A/RES/68/163 proclaiming 2 November as the [[International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists]]. The day acts to promote understanding of the broader issues that accompany impunity and to strengthen international commitment to ensuring a safe and enabling environment for journalists.&lt;ref&gt;See resolution A/RES/68/163: https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N13/449/23/PDF/N1344923.pdf?OpenElement&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity]] supports Member States in the implementation of proactive initiatives to address the prevailing culture of impunity, such as judicial [[capacity building]] and the strengthening of monitor and prosecution mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2017c.

=== Other attacks on the safe practice of journalism===
According to data compiled by the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] (CPJ), the imprisonment of journalists on charges relating to anti-state activities, [[Defamation|criminal defamation]], [[Blasphemy law|blasphemy]], [[Revenge|retaliation]] or on no charge at all, has reportedly continued to rise. In 2016, the CPJ reported that 259 journalists were imprisoned worldwide on a range of charges, the highest number since the non-governmental organization began keeping records in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Committee to Protect Journalists. 2016. 2016 prison census: 259 journalists jailed worldwide.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reporters Without Borders]] (RSF)—which tracks the imprisonment of [[Citizen journalism|citizen journalists]], [[Netizen]]s and media contributors, along with professional journalists—reported that 348 journalists were detained in 2016 on a range of charges, an increase of six per cent on 2015 figures. 2016 reportedly saw the proportion of [[Women in journalism|women journalists]] detained more than double, with nearly half of those detained located in the Asia-Pacific region. The Western Europe and North America region has the highest number of journalists imprisoned, holding 34 per cent of imprisoned journalists worldwide with 73 journalists imprisoned in Turkey in 2017.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;RSF. 2016. Worldwide Round-Up of journalists who are detained, held hostage or missing 2016. Available at https://rsf.org/en/reports/2016-round-number-journalists-detained-worldwide-continues-rise&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reporters Without Borders|RSF]] Secretary-General Christophe Deloire has stated that "a full-blown hostage industry has developed in certain conflict zones", with a 35 per cent increase in 2015 compared to the previous year of the number of media hostages held worldwide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tlakula, Pansy. 2016.

Threats and actual cases of violence and imprisonment, as well as harassment, are reported to have forced a large number of local journalists into exile each year. Between 1 June 2012 and 31 May 2015, at least 272 journalists reportedly went into exile for work-related persecution worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Committee to Protect Journalists. n.d. Journalists Forced Into Exile Since 2010. Available at https://cpj.org/exile/.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-censorship===
One survey conducted by [[PEN America]] of over 520 writers found that the majority reported concerns about [[Surveillance|government surveillance]], which led to a reluctance to write, research or speak about certain topics.&lt;ref&gt;Pen America. 2013. Chilling Effects. Pen America and The FDR Group. Available at https://pen.org/sites/default/files/2014-08-01_Full%20Report_Chilling%20Effects%20w%20Color%20cover-UPDATED.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Almost a quarter of the writers had deliberately avoided certain topics in phone and email conversations, while 16 per cent had avoided writing or speaking about a certain topic and another 11 per cent had seriously considered it.&lt;ref&gt;Pen America. 2013. Chilling Effects. Pen America and The FDR Group. Available at https://pen.org/sites/default/files/2014-08-01_Full%20Report_Chilling%20Effects%20w%20Color%20cover-UPDATED.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 survey conducted by the [[Council of Europe]] of 940 journalists throughout 47 Member States found that in the face of physical violence or coercion, 15 per cent of journalists abandon covering sensitive, critical stories, while 31 per cent tone down their coverage and 23 per cent opt to withhold information in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Marilyn, and Anna Grech. 2017.

== Digital safety for journalists==
[[File:Types of threats to the digital safety of journalism, WTR UNESCO.png|thumb|Types of threats to the digital safety of journalism]]
[[Surveillance]], [[data storage]] capabilities and digital attack technologies are becoming more sophisticated, less expensive and more pervasive, making journalists increasingly vulnerable to digital attacks from both state and [[Non-state actor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Marquis-Boire, Morgan. 2015. How governments are using spyware to attack free speech. Amnesty International. Available at https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2015/08/how-governments-are-using-spyware-to-attack-free-speech/&lt;/ref&gt;

In a number of states across multiple regions, broadly defined legislative acts have been seen by some as working to silence digital [[dissent]], prosecute [[Whistleblower|whistle blowers]] and expand arbitrary surveillance across multiple digital platforms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Cyber-harassment===
In late 2016, the [[International Press Institute]] launched the OnTheLine database, a project that aims to systematically monitor [[Cyberbullying|online harassment]] of journalists as a response to their reporting. As of July 2017, the project had collected 1,065 instances of online harassment in the two countries ([[Turkey]] and [[Austria]]) in which the project collected data. In [[Pakistan]], the Digital Rights Foundation has launched the country's first cyber harassment [[helpline]] for journalists, which aims to provide [[legal advice]], digital security support, psychological counselling and a referral system to victims.&lt;ref&gt;Digital Rights Foundation. n.d. Cyber Harassment Helpline. Digital Rights Foundation. Available at https://digitalrightsfoundation.pk/services/.&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2017, the helpline handled a total of 563 cases since its launch six months earlier, with 63 per cent of calls received from women and 37 per cent from men.&lt;ref&gt;Digital Rights Foundation. 2017.

== Gender equality and the safety of journalists==
{{See also|Women in journalism}}

=== Threats on women journalists===
Similar to their male counterparts, [[Women in journalism|women journalists]], whether they are working in an insecure context, or in a [[newsroom]], face risks of attacks while exercising their profession but are also particularly vulnerable to attacks of a sexual nature such as, [[sexual harassment]], [[sexual assault]], or even rape. Such attacks can come from those attempting to silence their coverage but also from sources, colleagues and others.&lt;ref&gt;Lanza, Edison. 2017. Silenced Zones: Highly Dangerous Areas for the Exercise of Freedom of Expression. Office for the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Available at http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/expression/docs/publications/ZONAS_SILENCIADAS_ENG.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 global survey of nearly 1,000 women journalists, initiated by the International News Safety Institute (INSI) in partnership with the [[International Women's Media Foundation]] (IWMF) and with the support of UNESCO, found that nearly two-thirds of women who took part in the survey had experienced intimidation, threats or abuse in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;International Media Women's Foundation and International News Safety Institute 2013, Available at https://newssafety.org/uploads/IWMF.FINALA.PDF.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period from 2012 through 2016, UNESCO's Director-General denounced the killing of 38 women journalists, representing 7 per cent of all journalists killed.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/unesco-condemns-killing-of-journalists&lt;/ref&gt;  The percentage of journalists killed who are women is significantly lower than their overall representation in the media workforce. This large gender gap is likely partly the result of the persistent under-representation of women reporting from war-zones or insurgencies or on topics such as politics and crime.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Janet, Nick Mosdell, and James Griffiths. 2016. Gender, Risk and Journalism. Journalism Practice 10 (7): 902–916&lt;/ref&gt;

The September 2017 report of the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] on the safety of journalists outlines a way forward for a gender-sensitive approach to strengthening the safety of women journalists.&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly. 2017.

Available at https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N17/245/44/PDF/N1724544.pdf?OpenElement.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the [[Council of Europe]]’s Committee of Ministers adopted Recommendation CM/Rec(2016)4 on the protection of journalism and safety of journalists and other media actors, in particular noting the gender-specific threats that many journalists face and calling for urgent, resolute and systematic responses.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe. 2016.

=== Online harassment of women journalists data===
[[File:Online harassment of women journalists.png|thumb|Online harassment of women journalists, UNESCO's ''World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development 2018''.]]
An analysis of more than two million tweets performed by the [[think tank]] [[Demos (U.S. think tank)|Demos]] found that women journalists experienced approximately three times as many abusive comments as their male counterparts on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;Demos. 2014. Demos: male celebrities receive more abuse on Twitter than women. Demos.

[[The Guardian]] surveyed the 70 million comments recorded on its website between 1999 and 2016 (only 22,000 of which were recorded before 2006). Of these comments, approximately 1.4&amp;nbsp;million (approximately two per cent) were blocked for abusive or disruptive behavior.

== Biography ==
Cazorla was born in 1955 in [[Larache]], then a [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco]], where her family had emigrated at the close of the 19th century. Her father was a military officer of high rank. Her older brother, Luis María Cazorla, is also a jurist. She started her career in 1981 at the Fiscalía of [[Girona]]. In 1984, she moved to [[Valladolid]]. In 1985, she joined the Audiencia Territorial de Madrid, followed by the Inspection Office of the Fiscalía General del Estado in 1993, and afterwards, the Secretaría Técnica.

In September 1996, she was appointed public prosecutor of the High Court, where she gained, between other responsibilities, a public indictment against [[Mario Conde]] in the Banesto case.&lt;ref name="PSOE_FICHA"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Soledad Cazorla, primera fiscal delegada contra la Violencia sobre la Mujer|url=http://www.psoe.es/igualdad/news/56943/page/soledad-cazorla-primera-fiscal-delegada-contra-violencia-sobre-mujer.html|date=18 July 2005|accessdate=4 May 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=La fiscalía pide que se aumente la condena a Conde de 10 a 22 años|url=http://cincodias.com/cincodias/2002/05/07/empresas/1020778807_850215.html|publisher=Cinco Días|date=7 May 2002|accessdate=4 May 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a defender of equality, and with a high personal commitment and professional interest in the fight against gender violence, her professional career was closely linked to the development of this law in Spain, especially, in the need to protect children who coexist with the hard reality of violence against mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Soledad Cazorla – Fondo de Becas Fiscal Soledad Cazorla Prieto|url=http://www.fundacionmujeres.es/becassoledadcazorla/soledad-cazorla/|work=fundacionmujeres.es|accessdate=19 February 2016|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These manifolds can be put together to form a 5-manifold &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;. A smooth curve &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed through &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt; with tangent 5-vector &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, transverse to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is defined so that  if &lt;math&gt;h_{t}&lt;/math&gt; is the family of 1-parameter maps which map &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N} \to \mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_{0} \in \mathcal{M}_{0}&lt;/math&gt; then a point &lt;math&gt;p_{\epsilon} \in \mathcal{M}_{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt; can be written as &lt;math&gt;h_{\epsilon}(p_{0})&lt;/math&gt;. This also defines a [[pullback (differential geometry)|pull back]] &lt;math&gt;h_{\epsilon}^{*}&lt;/math&gt; that maps a tensor field &lt;math&gt;T_{\epsilon} \in \mathcal{M}_{\epsilon} &lt;/math&gt; back onto &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{0}&lt;/math&gt;. Given sufficient smoothness a Taylor expansion can be defined

:&lt;math&gt;h_{\epsilon}^{*}(T_{\epsilon}) = T_{0} + \epsilon \, h_{\epsilon}^{*}(\mathcal{L}_{X}T_{\epsilon}) + O(\epsilon^{2})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\delta T = \epsilon h_{\epsilon}^{*}(\mathcal{L}_{X}T_{\epsilon}) \equiv \epsilon (\mathcal{L}_{X}T_{\epsilon})_{0}&lt;/math&gt; is the linear perturbation of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. However, since the choice of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is dependent on the choice of [[Gauge theory|gauge]] another gauge can be taken. Therefore the differences in gauge become &lt;math&gt;\Delta \delta T = \epsilon(\mathcal{L}_{X}T_{\epsilon})_0 - \epsilon(\mathcal{L}_{Y}T_{\epsilon})_0 = \epsilon(\mathcal{L}_{X-Y}T_\epsilon)_0&lt;/math&gt;. Picking a [[Chart (topology)|chart]] where &lt;math&gt;X^{a} = (\xi^\mu,1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y^a = (0,1)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;X^{a}-Y^{a} = (\xi^{\mu},0)&lt;/math&gt; which is a well defined vector in any &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and gives the result

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \delta T = \epsilon \mathcal{L}_{\xi}T_0.&lt;/math&gt;

The only three possible ways this can be satisfied are those of the lemma.

'''Tree-free paper''' or tree-free [[newsprint]] describes an alternative to [[wood-pulp paper]] by its [[raw material]] composition. It is claimed to be more [[environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]] considering the product's [[life cycle assessment|entire life cycle]].

Sources of fiber for tree-free paper include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treefreepaper.com/treefree101.php|title=Treefree 101|accessdate=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* agricultural residues (e.g. [[Bagasse|sugarcane bagasse]], [[husk]]s and [[straw]])
* [[fiber crop]]s and wild plants, such as [[bamboo]], [[kenaf]], [[hemp]], [[jute]], and [[flax]]
* [[textile]]s and [[Rope|cordage]] wastes

Non-fibre sources include:

* [[calcium carbonate]] bound by a non-toxic [[high-density polyethylene]] resin

[[Paper manufacturing]] is highly competitive, with historically tight margins and small operating profits. As a result, the raw materials used to make paper have to be very cost effective, using cheap, scalable renewable resources, coupled with relatively inexpensive ways to deliver large quantities to market. Until recently,{{when|date=January 2013}} commercial tree farming, has been shaped to account for these tight operating margins and supply cost limitations. Virtually all paper, however, requires massive [[logging|cutting]], [[replanting]] and re-cutting of wide swaths of forest. These limitations have made wood pulped farm grown supply stock the paper industry's overwhelming scalable raw material of choice.

The paper industry's answer to "tree free" paper has been focused on "[[paper recycling|recycled]] [[waste paper]]" as a tree free alternative even though the vast majority of "recycled waste paper" originally started its life cycle from tree grown pulp.

Fiber dense agricultural residues, have been known as a pulp substitute for years.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Commercial low cost production technology coupled with limited resource abundancy plus low cost transportation to commercial business markets had created a barrier, virtually relegating true "tree free" paper from developing into anything more than small niche markets with even smaller niche market players. Furthermore, grasses and annual plants often have high [[silica]] contents. Silica is problematic as it consumes pulping chemicals and produces [[fly ash]] when burned.

==Tuberculosis classification system==
The current clinical classification system for tuberculosis (TB) is based on the pathogenesis of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/cgi/content/full/161/4/1376 Diagnostic Standards and Classification of Tuberculosis in Adults and Children]. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med., Volume 161, Number 4, April 2000, 1376-1395.  This Official Statement of the [[American Thoracic Society]] and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] was Adopted by the ATS Board of Directors, July 1999. This Statement was endorsed by the Council of the [[Infectious Disease Society of America]], September 1999.  Class 0-5 are explained on pages 1391-1392.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Health care providers should comply with local laws and regulations requiring the reporting of TB.  All persons with class 3 or class 5 TB should be reported promptly to the local health department. See [[list of notifiable diseases]].

In [[sociolinguistics]], a '''T–V distinction''' (from the Latin [[pronoun]]s {{lang|la|'''t'''u}} and {{lang|la|'''v'''os}}) is a contrast, within one language, between various forms of addressing one's conversation partner or partners that are specialized for varying levels of politeness, [[social distance]], courtesy, familiarity, age or insult toward the addressee. Many languages lack this type of distinction, instead relying on more explicit wording to convey these meanings. The [[morphosyntax|morphosyntactic]] T–V distinction, though, is found in a variety of languages around the world.

English does not have a T–V distinction, with the exception of a few dialects. There previously was one with the pronouns ''[[thou]]'' and ''you'', with the familiar ''thou'' disappearing from [[Early Modern English]]. Additionally British commoners have historically spoken to nobility and royalty using the third person rather than the second person, a practice that has fallen out of favor. English speakers today often employ [[semantics|semantic]] analogues to convey the mentioned attitudes towards the addressee, such as whether to address someone by [[given name|given]] or [[surname]], or whether to use ''[[sir]]''/''[[madam|ma'am]]''. Under a broader classification, '''T''' and '''V''' forms are examples of [[honorifics (linguistics)|honorifics]].

The T–V distinction is expressed in a variety of forms. Two particularly common means are
# Addressing a single individual using the second-person plural forms in the language, instead of the singular (e.g. in French).
# Addressing individuals in the third person, rather than the second (e.g. in Spanish).

== History and usage ==
The terms '''T''' and '''V''', based on the [[Latin]] pronouns {{lang|la|tu}} and {{lang|la|vos}}, were first used in a paper by the social psychologist [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]] and the Shakespearian scholar [[Roger Brown (psychologist)#Personal life|Albert Gilman]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Pronouns of Power and Solidarity'' published in T.A Seboek (ed) (1960). Republished in Giglioli (1972). The pages numbers cited below are from Giglioli.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a historical and contemporary survey of the uses of pronouns of address, seen as [[semantic]] markers of social relationships between individuals. The study considered mainly [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[German language|German]]. The paper was highly influential&lt;ref&gt;Giglioli p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; and with few exceptions, the terms '''T''' and '''V''' have been used in subsequent studies.

=== Origin ===
In [[Latin language|Latin]], {{lang|la|tu}} was originally the singular, and {{lang|la|vos}} the plural, with no distinction for honorific or familiar. According to Brown and Gilman, usage of the plural to the [[Roman emperor]] began in the 4th century AD. They mention the possibility that this was because there were two emperors at that time (in [[Constantinople]] and [[Rome]]), but also mention that "plurality is a very old and ubiquitous metaphor for power". This usage was extended to other powerful figures, such as [[Pope Gregory I]] (590–604). However, Brown and Gilman note that it was only between the 12th and 14th centuries that the norms for the use of T- and V-forms crystallized. Less commonly, the use of the plural may be extended to other [[grammatical person|persons]], such as the "[[royal we|royal ''we'']]" ([[majestic plural]]) in [[English language|English]].

Brown and Gilman argued that the choice of form is governed by either relationships of 'power' and/or 'solidarity', depending on the culture of the speakers, showing that 'power' had been the dominant predictor of form in Europe until the 20th century. Thus, it was quite normal for a powerful person to use a T-form but expect a V-form in return. However, in the twentieth century the dynamic shifted in favour of solidarity, so that people would use T-forms with those they knew, and V-forms in service encounters, with [[wikt:reciprocity|reciprocal]] usage being the norm in both cases.

=== Early history: the power semantic ===
In the [[Early Middle Ages]] (the 5th century to the 10th century), the pronoun {{lang|la|vos}} was used to address the most exalted figures, emperors and popes, who would use the pronoun {{lang|la|tu}} to address a subject. This use was progressively extended to other states and societies, and down the social hierarchy as a mark of respect to individuals of higher rank, religious authority, greater wealth, or seniority within a family. The development was slow and erratic, but a consistent pattern of use is estimated to have been reached in different European societies by the period 1100 to 1500. Use of V spread to upper-class individuals of equal rank, but not to lower class individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Gilman pp. 254–255&lt;/ref&gt;
This may be represented in Brown and Gilman's notation:
:{| class="wikitable"
!colspan="2"| Unequal power
!colspan="2"| Equal power
|-
| Emperor          || Father           || High-class friend || Low-class friend
|-
| T↓{{spaces|2}}↑V || T↓{{spaces|2}}↑V || ↓↑V               || T↓↑
|-
| Subject          || Son              || High-class friend || Low-class friend
|}

=== Modification: the solidarity semantic ===
Speakers developed greater flexibility of pronoun use by redefining relationships between individuals. Instead of defining the father–son relationship as one of power, it could be seen as a shared family relationship. Brown and Gilman term this the semantics of solidarity. Thus a speaker might have a choice of pronoun, depending on how they perceived the relationship with the person addressed. Thus a speaker with superior power might choose '''V''' to express fellow feeling with a subordinate. For example, a restaurant customer might use '''V''' to their favourite waiter. Similarly a subordinate with a friendly relationship of long standing might use '''T'''. For example, a child might use '''T''' to express affection for their parent.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Gilman pp. 257–258&lt;/ref&gt;

This may be represented as:
:{| class="wikitable"
!colspan="3"| Superior has choice
!colspan="3"| Subordinate has choice
|-
| Customer          || Officer           || Employer          || Parent            || Master            || Elder sibling
|-
| T↓V{{spaces|2}}↑V || T↓V{{spaces|2}}↑V || T↓V{{spaces|2}}↑V || T↓{{spaces|2}}T↑V || T↓{{spaces|2}}T↑V || T↓{{spaces|2}}T↑V
|-
| Waiter            || Soldier           || Employee          || Child             || Faithful servant  || Younger sibling
|}
These choices were available not only to reflect permanent relationships, but to express momentary changes of attitude. This allowed playwrights such as [[Jean Racine|Racine]], [[Molière]], [[Ben Jonson|Ben Johnson]], [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]] and [[Shakespeare]] to express a character's inner changes of mood through outward changes of pronoun.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Gilman pp. 278–280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, David &amp; Ben (2002) pp. 450–451. Reproduced at David Crystal's [http://www.shakespeareswords.com/thou-and-you Explore Shakespeare's Works] site&lt;/ref&gt;

For centuries, it was the more powerful individual who chose to address a subordinate either with '''T''' or with '''V''', or to allow the subordinate to choose. For this reason, the pronouns were traditionally defined as the ''pronoun of either condescension or intimacy'' ('''T''') and ''the pronoun of reverence or formality'' ('''V'''). Brown and Gilman argue that modern usage no longer supports these definitions.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Gilman p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern history ===
Developments from the nineteenth century have seen the solidarity semantic more consistently applied. It has become less acceptable for a more powerful individual to exercise the choice of pronoun. Officers in most armies are not permitted to address a soldier as '''T'''. Most European parents cannot oblige their children to use '''V'''. The relationships illustrated above have changed in the direction of the following norms:&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Gilman pp. 269–261&lt;/ref&gt;
:{| class="wikitable"
!colspan="3"| Superior choice removed
!colspan="3"| Subordinate choice removed
|-
| Customer || Officer || Employer || Parent || Master           || Elder sibling
|-
| ↑↓V      || ↑↓V     || ↑↓V      || T↑↓    || T↑↓              || T↑↓
|-
| Waiter   || Soldier || Employee || Child  || Faithful servant || Younger sibling
|}
The tendency to promote the solidarity semantic may lead to the abolition of any choice of address pronoun. During the [[French Revolution]] attempts were made to abolish '''V'''. In 17th century England the [[Society of Friends]] obliged its members to use only '''T''' to everyone, and some continue to use '''T''' (''thee'') to one another.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Gilman pp. 266–268&lt;/ref&gt; In most Modern English dialects the choice of '''T''' no longer exists outside of poetry.

=== Changes in progress ===
It was reported in 2012 that use of the [[French language|French]] {{lang|fr|vous}} and the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{lang|es|usted}} are in decline in [[social media]].&lt;ref name="bbcnewsmag lawn 2012"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lawn |first=Rebecca |title=Tu and Twitter: Is it the end for 'vous' in French? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19499771 |accessdate=7 September 2012 |work=[[BBC News Magazine]] |date=7 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An explanation offered was that such online communications favour the philosophy of [[social equality|equality]], regardless of usual formal distinctions. Similar tendencies were observed in [[German language|German]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] as well as in [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref name="bbcnewsmag lawn 2012"/&gt;

=== History of use in individual languages ===

==== English ====
The [[Old English]] and [[Early Middle English#Early Middle English|Early Middle English]] [[grammatical person|second person]] pronouns {{lang|enm|thou}} and {{lang|enm|ye}} (with variants) were used for singular and plural reference respectively with no '''T–V''' distinction. The earliest entry in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] for ''ye'' as a '''V''' pronoun in place of the singular ''thou'' exists in a [[Middle English]] text of 1225 composed in 1200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/231466#eid13732377 |title=ye, ''pron.'' and ''n.'' |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |accessdate=10 November 2018 |url-access=subscription |quote=''a''1225 (▸c1200) ''Vices &amp; Virtues'' (1888) 31 (''MED''): {{lang|enm|Hwo is þat us muȝen sceawin ða gode ðe '''ȝe''' us behoteð?}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The usage may have started among the [[Norman French]] nobility in imitation of French. It made noticeable advances during the second half of the 13th century. During the 16th century, the distinction between the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] form ''ye'' and the [[object (grammar)|object]] form ''you'' was largely lost, leaving ''you'' as the usual '''V''' pronoun (and plural pronoun). After 1600, the use of ''ye'' in standard English was confined to literary and religious contexts or as a consciously archaic usage.&lt;ref&gt;"Interlude 12 : Choosing ''thou'' or ''you''" David Crystal (2004) pp. 307–310&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Crystal]] summarises [[Early Modern English]] usage thus:

'''V''' would normally be used
* by people of lower social status to those above them
* by the upper classes when talking to each other, even if they were closely related
* as a sign of a change (contrasting with ''thou'') in the emotional temperature of an interaction

'''T''' would normally be used
* by people of higher social status to those below them
* by the lower classes when talking to each other
* in addressing God/Jesus
* in talking to ghosts, witches, and other supernatural beings
* in an imaginary address to someone who was absent
* as a sign of a change (contrasting with ''you'') in the emotional temperature of an interaction&lt;ref&gt;Crystal (2004) p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''T–V''' distinction was still well preserved when Shakespeare began writing at the end of the 16th century. However, other playwrights of the time made less use of '''T–V''' contrasts than Shakespeare. The infrequent use of '''T''' in popular writing earlier in the century such as the [[Paston Letters]] suggest that the distinction was already disappearing from gentry speech. In the first half of the 17th century, ''thou'' disappeared from [[Standard English]], although the '''T–V''' distinction was preserved in many [[dialect|regional dialects]]. When the [[Quakers]] began using ''thou'' again in the middle of the century, many people were still aware of the old '''T–V''' distinction and responded with derision and physical violence.

In the 19th century, one aspect of the '''T–V''' distinction was restored to some English dialects in the form of a pronoun that expressed friendly solidarity, written as ''[[y'all]]''. Unlike earlier ''thou'', it was used primarily for plural address, and in some dialects for singular address as well.&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schneider |first=Edgar W. |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OqUBUgW_Ax8C&amp;pg=PA284 |chapter=The English dialect heritage of the southern United States |title=Legacies of Colonial English |editor-first=Raymond |editor-last=Hickey |year=2005 |page=284 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pronoun was first observed in the southern states of the US among [[African-American]] speakers, although its precise origin is obscure. The pronoun spread rapidly to [[White people|White]] speakers in those southern states, and (to a lesser extent) other regions of the US and beyond. This pronoun is not universally accepted, and may be regarded as either nonstandard or a regionalism.&lt;ref&gt;"Interlude 17, Tracking a change: the case of ''y'all''" Crystal (2004) pp. 449–452&lt;/ref&gt;

''Yous(e)'' (pron. {{IPAc-en|j|uː|z|}}, {{IPAc-en|j|ə|z|}}) as a plural is found mainly in [[English language in Northern England|(Northern) England]], [[Scottish English|Scotland]], parts of [[Hiberno-English|Ireland]], [[Australian English|Australia]], [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]], [[South African English|South Africa]], northern [[Nova Scotia]] and parts of [[Ontario]] in Canada and parts of the northeastern United States (especially areas where there was historically Irish or Italian immigration), including in [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], [[New York, New York|New York]], and scattered throughout working class Italian-American communities in the American [[Rust Belt]]. It also occurs in [[Scouse]] (the regional dialect of the [[Liverpool]] area).

In [[Old French]] texts, the pronouns {{lang|fr|tu}} and {{lang|fr|vous}} are often used interchangeably to address an individual, sometimes in the same sentence. However, some emerging pattern of use has been detected by recent scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Summarised in Fagyal et al (2006) pp. 267–268&lt;/ref&gt; Between characters equal in age or rank, {{lang|fr|vous}} was more common than {{lang|fr|tu}} as a singular address. However, {{lang|fr|tu}} was sometimes used to put a young man in his place, or to express temporary anger. There may also have been variation between [[Parisian (person)|Parisian]] use and that of other regions.

In the [[Middle French]] period a relatively stable '''T–V''' distinction emerged. ''Vous'' was the '''V''' form used by upper-class speakers to address one another, while {{lang|fr|tu}} was the '''T''' form used among lower class speakers. Upper-class speakers could choose to use either '''T''' or '''V''' when addressing an inferior. Inferiors would normally use '''V''' to a superior. However, there was much variation; in 1596 {{lang|fr|[[Étienne Pasquier]]|italic=no}} in his comprehensive survey {{lang|fr|Recherches de la France|italic=yes}} observed that the French sometimes used {{lang|fr|vous}} to inferiors as well as to superiors "{{lang|fr|selon la facilité de nos naturels}}" ("according to our natural tendencies"). In poetry, {{lang|fr|tu}} was often used to address kings or to speak to God.&lt;ref&gt;Fagyal et al p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use of names ===
The boundaries between formal and informal language differ from language to language, as well as within social groups of the speakers of a given language. In some circumstances, it is not unusual to call other people by first name and the respectful form, or last name and familiar form. For example, German teachers use the former construct with upper-secondary students, while Italian teachers typically use the latter (switching to a full V-form with university students). This can lead to constructions denoting an intermediate level of formality in T–V-distinct languages that sound awkward to English-speakers. In Italian, {{lang|it|(Signor) Vincenzo Rossi}} can be addressed with the {{lang|it|tu}} (familiar) form or the {{lang|it|Lei}} (formal) one, but complete addresses range from {{lang|it|Tu, Vincenzo}} (peer to peer or family) and {{lang|it|Tu, Rossi}} (teacher or fellow student to high-school student, as stated above) to {{lang|it|Lei, signor Vincenzo}} (live-in servant to master or master's son) and {{lang|it|Lei, Rossi}} (senior staff member to junior) and {{lang|it|Lei, signor Rossi}} (among peers).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

=== Translation issues ===
The use of these forms may be an issue for [[untranslatability#Compensation|compensating translation]] of dialogue into English if the translator does not wish to use the "thou" pronoun to translate. For example, a character in a French film or novel saying "{{lang|fr|Tutoie-moi&amp;thinsp;!}}" ("Use [the informal pronoun] {{lang|fr|tu}} when addressing me!") might be translated "Do not be so formal!" or "Call me by my first name!"

Conversely, when translating from English to a T–V language, the translator must decide again and again throughout the work which second-person form the reader would deem the more appropriate in a given situation. In the current German DVD release of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', the translators of the dubbed soundtrack and of the subtitles sometimes make opposite decisions; the actors dubbed voices speak with the familiar form, while the subtitles for the same scene are more formal.

== Singular, plural and other ways of distinction ==
In many languages, the respectful singular pronoun derives from a plural form. Some Romance languages have familiar forms derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] singular {{lang|la|'''t'''u}} and respectful forms derived from Latin plural {{lang|la|'''v'''os}}, sometimes via a circuitous route. Sometimes, singular V-form derives from a third person pronoun; in [[German language|German]] and some [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] languages, it is the third person ''plural''. Some languages have separate T and V forms for both singular and plural; others have the same form; others have a T–V distinction only in the singular.

Different languages distinguish pronoun uses in different ways. Even within languages, there are differences between groups (older people and people of higher status tending both to use and to expect more respectful language) and between various aspects of one language. For example, in Dutch, V form {{lang|nl|u}} is slowly falling into disuse in the plural, thus one could sometimes address a group as T form {{lang|nl|jullie}} (which clearly expresses the plural) when one would address each member individually as {{lang|nl|u}} (which has the disadvantage of being ambiguous). In Latin American Spanish, the opposite change has occurred – having lost the T form {{lang|nl|vosotros}}, Latin Americans address all groups as {{lang|nl|ustedes}}, even if the group is composed of friends whom they would call {{lang|nl|tú}} or {{lang|nl|[[voseo|vos]]}} (both T forms).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} In Standard Peninsular Spanish however, {{lang|nl|vosotros}} (literally, "you others") is still regularly employed in familiar conversation. In some cases V-forms are likely to be capitalized when written.

== In specific languages ==

=== Germanic ===

==== Afrikaans ====
Modern [[Afrikaans]] rarely makes the distinction between the informal {{lang|af|jy}} and {{lang|af|jou}} ("you" subject and "your" / "you" object) and the more formal {{lang|af|u}} (or {{lang|af|U}} when addressing God), although sometimes it is upheld in a formal setting, such as in politics, business or in a polite conversation. The trend is moving towards using the informal pronoun most often.

==== Dutch ====
[[Old Dutch]] did not appear to have a T–V distinction. {{lang|odt|Thu}} was used as the second-person singular, and {{lang|odt|gi}} as the second-person plural. In early [[Middle Dutch]], influenced by [[Old French]] usage, the original plural pronoun {{lang|dum|gi}} (or {{lang|dum|ji}} in the north) came to be used as a respectful singular pronoun, creating a T–V distinction. However, the formal {{lang|dum|gi}} started to be used in more and more situations. By the 17th century, {{lang|dum|du}} had largely fallen out of use, although it lingered on in some of the more peripheral areas. At this point, the original T–V distinction had been lost, and the original V-pronoun {{lang|dum|gij}}/{{lang|dum|jij}} was used universally for both singular and plural regardless of the type of address. This resembled the state of English today, which has also (outside of dialectal, literary or religious use) lost its original T-pronoun ''thou''.

Around this time, a new formal pronoun {{lang|dum|u}} started to come into use. This was also the object form of the subject pronoun {{lang|dum|gij}}/{{lang|dum|jij}}, and how it came to be used as a subject pronoun is not exactly clear. It is usually related to a form of address in writing of the time: letters were often addressed formally to {{lang|dum|U.E.}}, standing for {{lang|dum|Uwe Edelheid}} ("Your Highness"), which is thought to have been shortened to {{lang|dum|u}} eventually. It can be compared to the Spanish {{lang|es|usted}}, which is a similar contraction of a phrase of indirect address. As in Spanish, the Dutch {{lang|dum|u}} was originally conjugated as the third person in verbs, although most verbs had identical second- and third-person singular forms, so that this difference was not apparent for the most part. It remains today in the use of {{lang|nl|u heeft}} ("you (formal) have", like {{lang|nl|hij heeft}} "he has"), compared to {{lang|nl|jij hebt}} ("you (informal) have"). However, {{lang|nl|u hebt}} is now also common.

Around the same time, it became more common to clarify when multiple people were being spoken to, by adding {{lang|dum|luyden}}, {{lang|dum|lieden}} ("people"), or a shortened variety, to the end of the pronoun. Thus, when speaking to multiple people, one would use {{lang|dum|jij luyden}} or {{lang|dum|je lieden}}. This combination was contracted and fused over time, eventually resulting in {{lang|nl|jullie}}, the informal plural pronoun that is used today. It can be compared, in its origin, to the English ''y'all'' or Spanish {{lang|es|vosotros}}.

Modern northern [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and usually standard Dutch as well, has two forms of second person pronouns, namely {{lang|nl|jij}} and {{lang|nl|u}}. {{lang|nl|U}} is the formal pronoun, whereas {{lang|nl|jij}} is used as the informal personal pronoun to address a single person. In the plural, {{lang|nl|u}} is also used, alongside the informal {{lang|nl|jullie}}. In the south, only one pronoun, {{lang|nl|gij}}, is generally used in all three roles: both singular and plural, formal and informal. ''U'' is sometimes also used in formal situations, but the southern {{lang|nl|gij}} does not have a distinct informal connotation like the northern/standard {{lang|nl|jij}}, and can be used to address anyone without offence. Religious Dutch speakers in all areas address [[God]] using either {{lang|nl|Gij}} or {{lang|nl|U}}; {{lang|nl|jij}} is never used. For speakers of the north, this is usually the only place where {{lang|nl|gij}} is encountered, giving it a formal and archaic tone, even though it is neutral in the southern areas where it is still used.

The pronoun {{lang|nl|je}} (unstressed variant of {{lang|nl|jij}}) can also be used impersonally, corresponding to the English [[generic you]]. The more formal Dutch term corresponding to English [[generic you]] or [[generic one|one]] is {{lang|nl|men}}.

In Dutch the formal personal pronoun is used for older people or for people with a higher or equal status, unless the addressed makes it clear they want to be spoken to with the informal pronoun. Unlike for example in [[German language|German]], there is no defined line (in the case of German, roughly when someone passes the age of 16) in which everyone, apart from family, is addressed with the formal pronoun. Addressing parents by {{lang|nl|u}} has become very rare; {{lang|nl|jij}} is often even used to address grandparents. There is also a tendency towards more use of the informal pronoun. Some companies such as [[IKEA]] consciously address their customers with the informal {{lang|nl|jij}}. However, {{lang|nl|u}} can still be considered more or less obligatory in situations where, for example, a pupil addresses their teacher, people testify in court or communication between a doctor and their patient.

==== English ====
{{See also|Thou|You}}

Contemporary English generally uses only the form "you", regardless of level of familiarity.

[[Old English]] used {{wikt-lang|ang|þū}}&lt;ref&gt;{{wikt-lang|ang|þū|Þū}} was the [[nominative case]] of the word; the [[accusative case|accusative]] form was originally {{wikt-lang|ang|þeċ}} but over time the [[dative case|dative]] {{wikt-lang|ang|þē}} replaced it.&lt;/ref&gt; in the second-person singular for both formal and informal contexts. Following the [[Norman Conquest]], the [[Middle English]] that emerged continued to use ''{{linktext|þou}}''&lt;ref&gt;The accusative of {{wikt-lang|ang|þou}} was at first spelled {{wikt-lang|ang|þe}} or {{wikt-lang|ang|the}} but later became ''{{linktext|thee}}''.&lt;/ref&gt; at first, but by the 13th century, Norman [[#French|French]] influence had led to the use of the second-person plural {{wikt-lang|enm|ȝe}} or {{wikt-lang|enm|ye}} in formal contexts.

In [[Early Modern English]] superiors and strangers were therefore respectfully addressed as ''ye'' in the [[nominative case|nominative]]&lt;ref name="yeyou"/&gt; and ''you'' in the [[objective case|objective]]; ''thou'' and ''thee'' were used for familiars and subordinates. The more widespread and observed this division became, the more pejorative it became to strangers to be called by the familiar form of address. By the 17th century, such a use among the nobility was strongly and deliberately contemptuous, as in the declamation of the prosecutor at Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]'s 1603 trial "I thou thee, thou traitor!" Accordingly, the use of ''thou'' began to decline and it was effectively extinct in the everyday speech of most English dialects by the early 18th century, supplanted by the polite ''you'', even when addressing children and animals, something also seen in Dutch and Latin America (most of [[Brazilian Portuguese#Tu and você|Brazil]] and parts of [[Spanish language#Usted|Spanish America]]). Meanwhile, as part of English's continuing development away from its [[synthetic language|synthetic]] origins since the influx of French vocabulary following the Norman invasion, ''you'' had been replacing ''ye'' since the 15th century. Standard English was left with a single second-person pronoun for all cases, numbers and contexts and largely incapable of maintaining a T–V distinction.&lt;ref&gt;There is a minor amount of T–V distinction among dialects of English that ''(a)'' employ informal first-person singulars (such as [[South Yorkshire]]'s continuing use of ''tha'') or ''(b)'' have adopted a new second-person plural (such as the [[American South]]'s ''y'all''). The non-[[prestige dialect|prestige]] nature of these dialects means that they [[diglossia|maintain a separate language register]] (including ''you'') to be used among people outside their community whose judgment they are afraid of offending. For other variants, see the articles collected at [[:Category:Second-person plural pronouns in English]].&lt;/ref&gt;
Notwithstanding all of this, the translators of the [[King James version]] of the [[Bible]] chose to employ the older forms in their work (1604–1611) in order to convey the grammatical distinctions made by their [[Daniel Bomberg|Hebrew]], [[Theodore Beza|Greek]] and [[Robert Estienne|Latin]] sources. Its subsequent popularity and the religious rationale of many{{refn|Including the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]]' "[[Testimony of Simplicity|Plain Speech]]" and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saint]]' prayers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=Dallin H.

In the United States, some Protestant sects, such as the [[Society of Friends|Quakers]] and [[Mormons]] insisted on addressing everyone as ''thou'', because they considered every person to be a friend and an equal. This persisted until the 19th or early 20th century.

==== Frisian (West) ====
In [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]], the formal singular nominative {{lang|fy|jo}} (pronounced ''yo'') is very close to the English ''you'' and the Middle and Early Modern English {{lang|enm|ye}}. There is no such distinction in the plural; the plural second person pronoun is always {{lang|fy|jimme}}. {{lang|nl|[[Stadsfries]]|italic=no}}, a Dutch dialect with strong Frisian influence, parallels this distinction ({{lang|nl|dou}}, {{lang|nl|jou}}, {{lang|nl|jimme}}).

West Frisian {{lang|fy|jo}} is used slightly more often than Dutch {{lang|nl|u}}. Native speakers of Dutch are sometimes warned against addressing newly acquainted people with {{lang|fy|do}} too soon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pieter Duijff |title=Taal in stad en land – Fries en Stadsfries |publisher=Sdu Uitgevers |location=The Hague |year=2002 |pages=51–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== German ====
===== {{lang|de|Sie}} and {{lang|de|du}} =====
{{See also|Du (personal pronoun)}}
In [[German language|German]], the formal address {{lang|de|Sie}} is the same as the third person plural pronoun {{lang|de|sie}}. Verbs used with this form of address are also identical to third person plural forms. The polite form and its inflected forms are always capitalized in writing, to avoid any ambiguity.

The corresponding informal German address is {{lang|de|du}} or {{lang|de|Du}}. The verbs {{lang|de|duzen}} and {{lang|de|siezen}} mean respectively "to address using {{lang|de|du}}" and "to address using {{lang|de|Sie}}" and the phrases {{lang|de|per du}} or {{lang|de|auf du und du}} mean, "to be on du terms". The use of {{lang|de|Sie}} often coincides with the use of the title plus surname,&lt;ref name="Siedu"&gt;About.com [http://german.about.com/od/grammar/a/Siedu.htm Sie &amp; Du].&lt;/ref&gt; usage of which is more widespread in German-speaking areas than Anglophone areas.&lt;ref name="Siedu"/&gt; In general terms, {{lang|de|du}} is used to children, animals and God, and between adults (or between adults and children) who are good friends of or related to each other. {{lang|de|Sie}} is used in other situations, such as in a business situation or where there is no existing relationship.&lt;ref name="Siedu"/&gt; In Internet chats and forums, Germans rarely use {{lang|de|Sie}}, although there are exceptions. Except in the case of adults addressing children, where it is common for the child to address the adult as {{lang|de|Sie}}, but be addressed as {{lang|de|du}} in return, it is not common in German for one party to address the other as {{lang|de|Sie}}, but be addressed as {{lang|de|du}} in return.&lt;ref name="Siedu"/&gt; In almost all cases it can be considered as impolite to use the "wrong" pronoun, that is a pronoun that is not expected by the other party. However on the other hand, using an unexpected {{lang|de|du}} can also be a very welcome sign of affection, and using an unexpected {{lang|de|Sie}} can, in the young, be a very welcome sign of appreciation of the addressed one's maturity.

High school students in Germany are often called {{lang|de|Sie}} plus given name ({{lang|de|Hamburger Sie}}) by their teachers when they enter the {{lang|de|[[Abitur|Oberstufe]]}} — the last 2 or 3 years of high school — around the age of 16.

Children and teenagers are expected to use {{lang|de|Sie}} when addressing all adults except for family members and family friends whom they have known since early childhood. Street and similar social workers, sports clubs trainers will sometimes tell children and teens to address them with {{lang|de|du}}. In shops, bars, and other establishments, if they target a younger audience, it is becoming increasingly common for customers and staff to address each other as {{lang|de|du}}, to the degree that it is sometimes considered awkward if a waitress and a customer who are both in their twenties call each other {{lang|de|Sie}}.

The use of {{lang|de|du}} or {{lang|de|Sie}} between two strangers may also be determined by the setting in which they meet (casual/formal), as well as clothing (casual/formal), gender (same/opposite), and personal preference. For example, it is customary to use {{lang|de|du}} in traditional small pubs and taverns in certain regions (including the [[Rhineland]]). This applies also to older people, whom one would otherwise address as {{lang|de|Sie}}. Two people who addressed each other as {{lang|de|du}} in a pub may go back to {{lang|de|Sie}} when they meet in the street if their acquaintance was only very superficial. During the famous Rhenish [[carnival]], it is customary for most revelers to address each other as {{lang|de|du}}. Only if the age difference is more than one generation, the younger person might still use {{lang|de|Sie}}. Another setting in which {{lang|de|du}} is often used between adults is sporting events.

Being {{lang|de|per du}} has also become increasingly common in workplace environments (depending on the line of business and corporate culture to varying degrees), mostly regardless of age. In such environments, the {{lang|de|du}} basis may also be observed as a (sometimes necessary) mark of good social integration within a working group. As a rule of thumb, one might expect to see team colleagues on the workplace level in many industries on a customary {{lang|de|du}} basis with each other, though not always with the group manager and more rarely with higher-ranking managers. As entrants to a team are more closely integrated, this is often marked by making an informal affirmation to that basis or by formally offering it, as a matter of style and habituality. Both the tempo and extent of using the {{lang|de|du}} basis depends much on the culture (and sometimes the climate) of the business, and in some places even more so on that of the particular workgroup itself. Business cultures that pride themselves on a "flat hierarchy" are more likely to adopt or accent a general professional parlance of {{lang|de|du}} and given name while inside corporations tending to emphasize professional formality, a {{lang|de|Sie}} may be expected to be used always except between very close colleagues or inside closed groups (sometimes including managers meeting on the same level with the exclusion of any subordinates), and strictly always in the presence of a superior. The superior, on the other hand, has the right to address the other perform informally or formally, which is a personal preference.

Customarily, the switch from {{lang|de|Sie}} to {{lang|de|du}} is initially proposed by the elder of the two people, the person with socially higher standing or by the lady to the gentleman. Alternatively, one person may use {{lang|de|Sie}} while they ask the other person if it is acceptable to be addressed informally, and then act accordingly. One way to propose the use of {{lang|de|du}} rather than {{lang|de|Sie}} is by stating one's first name (as in: {{lang|de|Ich heiße...}}). One accepts the proposal by introducing one's own first name. Should a person later forget that they have adopted {{lang|de|du}}, it is polite to remind them by saying, {{lang|de|Wir waren doch per du}} (We moved on to {{lang|de|du}} terms). Sometimes switching back to {{lang|de|Sie}} is used as a method of distancing oneself from the addressee; the connotation is slightly ironic courtesy.

The inappropriate and uninvited use of {{lang|de|du}} towards someone who would otherwise reasonably expect to be addressed as {{lang|de|Sie}} is considered to be condescending and disrespectful, although insistence on {{lang|de|Sie}} in an environment where {{lang|de|du}} is largely accepted (flat hierarchies) can be interpreted as being equally disrespectful. The degree of offense that might be taken will depend on how obvious the etiquette violation was (an example of an obvious violation would be a teenager in the street addressing an elderly stranger on the street with {{lang|de|du}}, addressing a senior manager with {{lang|de|du}} as a result of a misjudged professional relationship would probably be taken with less offense), and will also depend on the upbringing of the person in question – progressive vs. conservative outlooks and age are examples of factors which can play a role in how individuals prefer to be addressed and choose to address others.

It has become the policy of some businesses for their employees to address customers with {{lang|de|du}}, often to set a progressive, "modern" tone, occasionally for other cultural reasons. [[IKEA]], for instance, does this to reflect the widespread use of the {{lang|sv|du}} form in Sweden (see {{lang|sv|[[Du-reformen]]}}).

In Germany, an old [[norm (sociology)|custom]] (called {{lang|de|Bruderschaft trinken}}, drinking brotherhood) involves two friends formally sharing a bottle of [[wine]] or drinking a glass of [[beer]] together to celebrate their agreement to call one another {{lang|de|du}} rather than {{lang|de|Sie}}. This custom has also been adopted among the Swiss-French of the Jura, in Poland and Russia (called by its German name, spelled {{lang|pl|bruderszaft}} and {{lang|ru|брудершафт}} respectively), though the custom in Poland is now slowly disappearing. It was formerly found also in Sweden.

Although the use of {{lang|de|Sie}} generally coincides with the use of title plus surname, especially in northern and eastern Germany, there is an intermediate address combining {{lang|de|Sie}} with the first name ({{lang|de|[[:de:Hamburger Sie|Hamburger Sie]]}}), whereas in the Berlin region, sometimes {{lang|de|Du}} is combined with the surname ({{lang|de|Berliner Du}}). The former usage also occurs when addressing teenagers, household staff, or guests of TV or radio programs, while the latter style is usually considered inferior and mainly occurs in working class environments. It may be associated with professional contexts, when colleagues have known one another for a long time, but, e. g. due to differences of status, do not want to switch to the usual {{lang|de|Du}} style; or in situations where strangers (e.g. customers) are present for whom it would not be appropriate to learn the first name of the addressee.

When speaking to more than one person in formal situations where one would use {{lang|de|Sie}} to each one of them separately, Standard German uses {{lang|de|Sie}}. However, in this situation {{lang|de|ihr}} can often be heard instead, especially in the South of Germany and in [[Swiss German|Swiss German dialects]], and is standard usage for pastors when preaching. If the {{lang|de|Sie}} standard here is followed, then the usage varies when addressing a group containing both {{lang|de|du}} and {{lang|de|Sie}} persons: Some speakers use the informal plural {{lang|de|ihr}} others prefer the formal {{lang|de|Sie}} and many, concerned that both pronouns might cause offence, prefer to use circumlocutions that avoid either pronoun, for example by expressing an [[imperative mood|imperative]] in [[infinitive]] form ({{lang|de|bitte das machen}}), by applying the [[passive voice]] ({{lang|de|es wird gemacht}}), or using the [[generic you|indefinite pronoun]] {{lang|de|man}} ({{lang|de|man macht das}}).

===== Historical predecessors: {{lang|de|Ihr}} and {{lang|de|Er}}/{{lang|de|Sie}} =====
Formerly, the 2nd person plural {{lang|de|Ihr}} ("ye") was used to address social superiors, unless more informal relations had been established. The use of {{lang|de|Ihr}} as the polite form, as this is the case with {{lang|fr|vous}} in the French language, has still survived in [[Bernese German]] and other [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] dialects. {{lang|de|Ihr}} in this case has to be capitalized. However, {{lang|de|Ihr}} itself shows a degree of informality, and would for example be used in addressing one's father. For the formal address, the third person would be used; and this in the singular with {{lang|de|Er}}, {{lang|de|Sie}} (capitalized) to a social inferior, as a farmer addressing a stableboy, or in the plural to a social superior. It is from the latter occurrences that modern {{lang|de|Sie}} takes its origin; {{lang|de|Sie}} is the 3rd person plural pronoun. However, {{lang|de|Sie}} itself is relatively young, and it was rather the formal addresses, often itself singular forms, that took the plural. Even as late as in [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt|Dürrenmatt]]'s "The Visit" (written in 1956), an address {{lang|de|Das wissen Herr Bürgermeister schon}} ("You do know that, Mr Mayor", modern German would just say {{lang|de|Das wissen Sie schon}}) can be found; Herr Bürgermeister is the formal address and itself a singular term, but wissen is plural. However, if the formal address itself contains a personal pronoun as in {{lang|de|Seine Majestät}} (His Majesty) etc., this one would be put to the 2nd person plural: {{lang|de|Was geruhen Euer}} (not: {{lang|de|Seine}}) {{lang|de|Majestät zu befehlen?}} ("What does [but plural] Your Majesty condescend to order?")

Thus, all these go by a similar grammar rule pertaining to the verb used with these addresses as modern {{lang|de|Sie}}. The dated capitalized address {{lang|de|Ihr}} demands the same verb form as the modern second person plural pronoun {{lang|de|ihr}}, the dated {{lang|de|Er}}/{{lang|de|Sie}} demands the same verb form as the modern third person singular {{lang|de|er}} and {{lang|de|sie}}, and the dated 3rd person plural address without {{lang|de|Sie}} demands, just as {{lang|de|Sie}} itself, the same verb form as the 3rd person plural pronoun {{lang|de|sie}} (they).

The forms are still found today in some dialects as a respectful way of addressing elders, and is still very often found in works of art and literature (such as books and movies) depicting events at least several centuries in the past, or in a "past-like" fantasy setting, even if modern German is otherwise used in these works; indeed, using the modern {{lang|de|Sie}} in such a setting would be considered an out-of-place anachronism. {{lang|de|Ihr}} and the 3rd person plural without {{lang|de|Sie}} is somewhat analogous to the English [[majestic plural]].

The {{lang|de|Er}}/{{lang|de|Sie}} form is not widely known or understood by the average person any more. While {{lang|de|Ihrzen}} is often still used in dubbed films, especially in medieval/fantasy contexts such as [[Lord of the Rings]] e.g. "{{lang|de|'''Ihr''' habt das Reich der Herrin des Waldes betreten, '''Ihr''' könnt nicht umkehren}}" ("you have entered the Realm of the Lady of the Wood, you can not turn back"). In this context, a historical level is used where the second person plural indicates some nobility of or respect for the addressee, such that from {{lang|de|Ihr}} being used to address a single person, the viewer could mostly, without looking, conclude that the person was of elevated rank such as a king or nobleman, or at least being treated with expressed regard. {{lang|de|Ihr}} would not normally be used to address a peasant (unless he is a prince in disguise or a future prince and the person addressing him has gathered some knowledge or presumption of that).

==== Scandinavian languages ====
===== Danish =====
In [[Danish language|Danish]], the informal second-person singular is {{wikt-lang|da|du}} and the formal form of address uses the third-person plural {{wikt-lang|da|De}}, capitalized to distinguish it from its other use. The second-person plural {{wikt-lang|da|I}} and the third-person singular {{wikt-lang|da|han}} ("he") or {{wikt-lang|da|hun}} ("she") were sometimes used until the early 19th century in standard Danish&lt;ref&gt;As in [[Ludvig Holberg]]'s dramas.&lt;/ref&gt; and awhile longer in the countryside. The German-inspired form {{lang|da|De}} entered Danish in the 18th century, too late to enter liturgical use. In church, as in rural or dialect-speaking areas, {{lang|da|du}} has always been the universal form, especially in [[Jutland]].

As in other Scandinavian languages, even among the prestige dialects, the formal pronoun is waning in use — in the case of Danish, since the {{lang|da|[[:da:Ungdomsoprøret i Danmark|Ungdomsoprøret]]}} ("Youth Revolts") during and after the [[protests of 1968]]. As a general rule, the informal {{lang|da|du}} is accepted everywhere today, except when addressing [[Danish royal family|royalty]]{{refn|Some members of the royal family insist upon it. During a 2010 interview with a [[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV 2]] journalist on board the training ship ''[[Danmark (ship)|Danmark]]'', [[Prince Joachim of Denmark|Prince Joachim]] pointedly refused to answer a question posed in the {{lang|da|du}} form until the reporter rephrased it as {{lang|da|De}}. The public debate then centered around whether the prince had demonstrated snobbishness, the journalist ignorance, or both.&lt;ref&gt;DR 2. [http://vimeo.com/66100977 Prince Joachim interview].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daily Motion.com.

In other contexts, it has come to seem excessively formal and old-fashioned to most Danes.{{refn|A 2012 survey found that only 6% of Danes would use {{lang|da|De}} towards anyone they met and 16% would self-consciously never use it. However, 64% accepted its use towards members of the [[Danish royal family]].&lt;ref name=bork&gt;Etik.dk. ''[http://m.etik.dk/artikel/469393:Danmark--Hver-fjerde-dansker-vil-afskaffe--De Hver fjerde dansker vil afskaffe 'De']'' ["One in four Danes want to abolish '{{lang|da|De}}'&amp;thinsp;"]. 6 July 2012. {{da-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Even at job interviews and among [[f
olketing|parliamentarians]],&lt;ref&gt;During debates at the [[Folketing]], members are required to address one another in the third person by title or with the prefix of {{lang|da|hr.}} (Mr.) or {{lang|da|fru}} (Mrs.), {{lang|da|frøken}} (Miss) having recently been given up. In debates away from the rostrum, however, they invariably default to {{lang|da|du}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|da|du}} has become standard.

In written Danish, {{lang|da|De}} remains current in legal, legislative, and formal business documents, as well as in some translations from other languages. This is sometimes audience-dependent, as in the Danish government's general use of {{lang|da|du}} except in healthcare information directed towards the elderly,{{refn|The same 2012 survey said 46% of Danes use {{lang|da|De}} when speaking towards the elderly, out of respect. At the same time, the elderly were much more supportive of abolishing the word entirely.&lt;ref name="bork"/&gt;}} where {{lang|da|De}} is still used. Other times, it is maintained as an affectation, as by the staff of some formal restaurants, the {{lang|da|[[Weekendavisen]]|italic=yes}} newspaper, [[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV 2]] announcers, and the avowedly conservative [[Maersk]] corporation. Attempts by other corporations to avoid sounding either stuffy or too informal by employing circumlocutions — using [[passive voice|passive phrasing]] or using the pronoun {{lang|da|man}} ("one") — have generally proved awkward and been ill-received,&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Erik.

''[http://www.målogmæle.dk/MoM-arkiv/MoM_21/MoM21_1.pdf Mål og Mæle]'', #1. 1998. {{Da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (with the notable exception of the national railway [[Danske Statsbaner|DSB]]) most have opted for the more personable {{lang|da|du}} form.

===== Icelandic =====
Modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] is the Scandinavian dialect closest to [[Old Norse]], which made a distinction between the plural {{lang|is|þér}} and the dual {{lang|is|þið}}. This distinction continued in written Icelandic the early 1920 when the plural {{lang|is|þér}} was also used on formal occasions. The formal usage of {{lang|is|þér}} seems to have pushed the dual {{lang|is|þið}} to take over the plural so modern Icelandic normally uses {{lang|is|þið}} as a plural. However, in formal documents such as by the president {{lang|is|þér}} is still used as plural, and the usage of {{lang|is|þér}} as plural and {{lang|is|þið}} as dual is still retained in the Icelandic translation of the Christian scriptures. There are still a number of fixed expressions — particularly religious adages such as "seek and ye shall find" ({{lang|is|leitið og þér munuð finna}}) — and the formal pronoun is sometimes used in translations from a language that adheres to a T–V distinction, but otherwise it appears only when one wants to be excessively formal either from the gravity of the occasion (as in court proceedings and legal correspondence) or out of contempt (in order to ridicule another person's self-importance), and {{lang|is|þú}} is used in all other cases.

===== Norwegian =====
In [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], the polite form {{lang|nb|De}}/{{lang|nb|Dem}} ({{lang|nb|[[Bokmål]]|italic=no}}) and {{lang|nn|De}}/{{lang|nn|Dykk}} ({{lang|nn|[[Nynorsk]]|italic=no}}) has more or less disappeared in both spoken and written language. Norwegians now exclusively use {{lang|no|du}}, and the polite form does not have a strong cultural pedigree in the country. Until recently, {{lang|no|De}} would sometimes be found in written works, business letters, plays and translations where an impression of formality must be retained. The popular belief that {{lang|no|De}} is reserved for the [[king of Norway|king]] is incorrect, since according to royal etiquette, the King (and other members of the royal family) will be addressed as {{lang|nb|Deres majestet}} ({{lang|nb|Bokmål|italic=no}})/{{lang|nn|Dykkar majestet}} ({{lang|nn|Nynorsk|italic=no}}) (Your majesty) or in third person singular as {{lang|no|Hans majestet}} (His majesty), {{lang|nb|Hennes majestet}}/{{lang|nn|Hennar majestet}} (Her majesty), {{lang|no|Kongen}} (the King), {{lang|no|Dronningen}} (the Queen) and similar.

Norwegians generally refer to one another by first name only, unless the person is better known by full or last name only. This also contributes to the weakening of these pronouns and a general pattern of declining use of polite speech. For example, a student might address their professor by their first name, but would refer to a leading politician by their last name. Norwegian politicians and celebrities are sometimes referred to by their first names, especially in newspaper headlines, while the text of the article most likely would use the person's last name. Nicknames are not very common.

The distinction between {{lang|nb|Bokmål|italic=no}} and {{lang|nn|Nynorsk|italic=no}} exists primarily for written Norwegian (most Norwegians speak dialects that differ from the standard written forms), and the T–V rules are the same for both forms—except that {{lang|nb|Bokmål|italic=no}} uses the third person plural to indicate politeness (as in German), while {{lang|nn|Nynorsk|italic=no}} uses the second person plural (as in French). In both forms, when these pronouns are used to indicate politeness, they are always capitalised (to show deference, and separate them from when they indicate, respectively, the third and second person plural).

===== Swedish =====
{{Main|Du-reformen}}
In [[Swedish language|Swedish]], there has in the last two centuries been a marked difference between usage in [[Finland Swedish]] and in [[Sweden]].

In the Swedish of Sweden, the polite {{lang|sv|Ni}} was known from earlier epochs, but had come to be considered somewhat careless, bullying or rude; instead, an intricate system had evolved in order to prudently step around pronouns almost altogether. Parts of this system began to erode around the Second World War or so, but the essentials held up into the 1960s.

As the 20th century progressed, this circumlocutive system of addressing, with its innumerable ambiguities and opportunities for unintentional offence, was increasingly felt as a nuisance. In the sixties, the so-called {{lang|sv|[[du-reformen]]}} ('thou-reform') was carried out. First, authorities and influential circles tried rehabilitating the {{lang|sv|Ni}} in a so-called "{{lang|sv|ni}} reform"—but most people could not bring themselves to feel civil using that. Then, almost overnight and dubbed the "{{lang|sv|du}} reform", the system broke down, and {{lang|sv|du}} (noted as informal above) became the accepted way of addressing anyone except for royalty.

Addressing royalty went somewhat more slowly from a universal {{lang|sv|Ers majestät}} ('Your Majesty'), etc., to that address only on formal occasions, otherwise replaced by third person (singular if the addressee is single) with title ({{lang|sv|K(on)ungen}} 'the King', etc.).

These rules still apply, with marginal exceptions. The vast majority of Swedes, including younger people in most or all situations, stick to the {{lang|sv|du}}. In order to "alleviate the intrusion" in writing, e.g. in letters or in advertisement, the {{lang|sv|Du}} can be capitalized. That usage was most widespread in the early days of universal ''du'' address; it has become slightly more common again simultaneously with the partial {{lang|sv|Ni}} revival.

Finland Swedish has undergone a similar development to mainland Swedish since the 1960s, but slower and slightly less. There, one may have to reckon with influence from the [[Finnish language]], still slightly more conservative. In Finland Swedish, the second person plural form {{lang|sv|Ni}} (noted as formal above) was indeed the traditional respectful address to a single person up to the 1970s or so.

Swedish, also, has verbs for the addresses: {{lang|sv|dua}} 'to say {{lang|sv|du}}', and {{lang|sv|nia}} 'to say {{lang|sv|ni}}'.

In [[Modern Scots]] the second person singular nominative {{lang|sco|thoo}} ({{IPA|[ðuː]}}, [[Southern Scots]] {{IPA|[ðʌu]}}, [[Shetlandic]] {{IPA|[duː]}}) survived in colloquial speech until the mid 19th century in most of lowland Scotland.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} It has since been replaced by {{lang|sco|ye}}/{{lang|sco|you}} in most areas except in [[Insular Scots]] where {{lang|sco|thee}} ({{IPA|[ðiː]}}, Shetlandic {{IPA|[diː]}}) is also used, in [[North Northern Scots]] and in some Southern Scots varieties. {{lang|sco|Thoo}} is used as the familiar form by parents speaking to children, elders to youngsters, or between friends or equals. The second person formal singular {{lang|sco|ye}} or {{lang|sco|you}} is used when speaking to a superior or when a youngster addresses an elder. The older second person singular possessive {{lang|sco|thy}} ({{IPA|[ðai]}}), and {{lang|sco|thee}} ({{IPA|[ði]}}, Shetlandic {{IPA|[diː]}} along with {{lang|sco|thine(s)}} {{IPA|[dəin(z)]}}) still survive to some extent where {{lang|sco|thoo}} remains in use.

==== Yiddish ====
[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] makes use of the second person plural form as the polite form for both singular and plural. In the second person plural form {{lang|yi|איר}} ({{lang|yi-Latn|ir}}), there is therefore no distinction between formal and informal forms. There is a [[dialect]]al pronoun {{lang|yi|עץ}} ({{lang|yi-Latn|ets}}) strictly for informal second-person plural form, but this pronoun is rarely used today and is only found in some dialects of Poland and neighboring regions.

Given that old German dialects were the main influence on the development of the Yiddish language, this form may be recognized with older polite forms of the German language.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

=== Romance languages ===
==== French ====
In most [[French language|French]]-speaking regions (Canada is an exception; see "[[#North American French|North American French]]" below), a rigid T–V distinction is upheld. With regard to the second person singular, {{lang|fr|tu}} is used informally, whereas {{lang|fr|vous}} is used to convey formality. (The second person plural is always {{lang|fr|vous}}.) The formal {{lang|fr|vous}} is expected when encountering any unknown adult under normal circumstances. In general, the switch from {{lang|fr|vous}} to {{lang|fr|tu}} is "negotiated" on a case-by-case basis; it can happen nearly unconsciously, or can be explicitly negotiated. For instance, some couples have been known to call each other {{lang|fr|vous}} for some time while dating, and gradually switch to calling each other {{lang|fr|tu}}. The verb {{wikt-lang|fr|tutoyer}} means "address someone with {{lang|fr|tu}}-forms, speak informally"; by contrast {{lang|fr|vouvoyer}} means "address someone with {{wikt-lang|fr|vous}} forms". Rigidly sticking to ''vous'' can become equally awkward in a long-standing relationship.

In certain circumstances, however, {{lang|fr|tu}} is used more broadly. For example, new acquaintances who are conscious of having something socially significant in common (e.g., student status, or the same "rank" in some hierarchy) often use ''tu'' more or less immediately. In some cases, there may be an explicitly defined practice in a particular company, political party, as to the use of {{lang|fr|tu}} and {{lang|fr|vous}}. Also, using the {{lang|fr|vous}} in conjunction with someone's given name is rather current in France as a less formal way of addressing someone, e.g. at work, among members of an association etc. Children and adolescents generally use {{lang|fr|tu}} to speak with someone of their own age, whether known or not. {{lang|fr|Tu}} can also be used to show disrespect to a stranger, such as when surprising a thief or cursing other drivers on the road.

{{lang|fr|Vous}} may be used to distance oneself from a person with whom one does not want to interact. Additionally, two people who use {{lang|fr|tu}} in their private interactions may consciously switch back to {{lang|fr|vous}} in public in order to act appropriately in a formal or professional environment, to play the part in an artificially constructed situation (such as between co-hosts of a television show), or simply to conceal the nature of their relationship from others.

In families, {{lang|fr|vous}} was traditionally used to address older family members. Children were taught to use {{lang|fr|vous}} to address their parents, and {{lang|fr|vous}} was used until about 1950 between spouses of the higher classes. Former president [[Jacques Chirac]] and his wife Bernadette are a prominent example of the continuation of this usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/19/style/19iht-blume.t.html |title=Mastering the Unmasterable: A French Puzzle |author=Mary Blume |work=[[International Herald Tribune]] |date=19 February 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When praying, {{lang|fr|tu}} is nowadays often used in addressing the deity, though {{lang|fr|vous}} was used in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] prayers until the [[Second Vatican Council]], and is still used to address the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]. In Louisiana, however, {{lang|fr|vous}} is always used to convey a sense of respect and reverence when praying.

In Walloon, the use of which tends, in any case, to be restricted mostly to "familiar" contexts, {{lang|wa|vos}} (equivalent to {{lang|fr|vous}}) is the general usage and is considered informal and friendly. {{lang|wa|Ti}} (equivalent to {{lang|fr|tu}}), on the other hand, is considered vulgar, and its use can be taken as an expression of an aggressive attitude towards the person addressed. This influence from Walloon affects the usage of {{lang|fr|tu}} and {{lang|fr|vous}} in the French spoken in Belgium, though more so among people accustomed to using Walloon as their everyday language (a tiny minority, mostly in the countryside). The influence of Standard French, particularly as exercised through the [[mass media]], is eroding this particularity among younger French-speakers.

In the {{lang|fr|[[early modern France|ancien régime]]}}, the use of honorific styles or their abbreviation {{lang|fr|Elle}} (literally ''she'', irrespective of the gender of the addressee, as the honorifics were feminine nouns) together with the 3rd person singular was also common. See below for [[#Italian|Italian]] which has kept this style.

===== North American French =====
[[Canadian French|North American dialects of French]], including [[Quebec French]] and [[Acadian French]] as well as [[Louisiana French]], permit and expect a far broader usage of the familiar {{lang|fr|tu}} than in [[Standard French]]. There are still circumstances in which it is necessary to say {{lang|fr|vous}}: in a formal interview (notably for a job) or when addressing people of very high rank (such as judges or prime ministers), senior citizens, between professors and students in universities, towards customers or new acquaintances in a formal setting. As acquaintances become familiar with one another, they may find {{lang|fr|vous}} to be unnecessarily formal and may agree to return to the {{lang|fr|tu}} with which they are generally more comfortable.

For a number of Francophones in Canada, {{lang|fr|vous}} sounds stilted or snobbish, and archaic. {{lang|fr|Tu}} is by no means restricted to intimates or social inferiors. There is however an important minority of people, often those who call for a use of standard French in Quebec, who prefer to be addressed as {{lang|fr|vous}}. At [[Radio-Canada]] (the public broadcaster, often considered as establishing the normative objectives of standard French in Canada), the use of {{lang|fr|vous}} is widespread even among colleagues.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===== African French =====
In {{lang|fr|[[Côte d'Ivoire]]|italic=no}}, local languages (such as [[Baoulé language|Baoulé]], [[Dyula language|Dioula]], etc.) do not make a distinction between informal or formal pronouns, which reflects on the local usage of French. It is thus uncommon to call an individual {{lang|fr|vous}}. A waiter, shop-keeper or taxi driver can very well call a customer {{lang|fr|vous}}, just like an employee towards a superior. For example, an accountant could call her direct branch manager {{lang|fr|tu}}, but will still use {{lang|fr|vous}} to address the company's CEO.

Relationships between men and women are typically less formal than between people of the same gender (a female supermarket worker will more easily say {{lang|fr|tu}} towards a male customer than her male colleague).

Even in formal situations (business, politics), the superiors can often be called in a familiar way by subordinates who will use affectionate terms of address such as {{lang|fr|vieux père}}, {{lang|fr|papa}}, {{lang|fr|tonton}}, {{lang|fr|patron}}, {{lang|fr|boss}} for males, {{lang|fr|la vieille mère}}, {{lang|fr|maman}}, {{lang|fr|tata}}, {{lang|fr|patronne}} for females, instead of the standard {{lang|fr|monsieur}} and {{lang|fr|madame}}. Superiors reciprocate with terms of address such as {{lang|fr|mon fils}}, {{lang|fr|mon petit}}, {{lang|fr|ma chérie}}, {{lang|fr|ma fille}}. All those terms of address typically exclude the use of "vous".

The use is also conditioned to the "level" of French being spoken: using a Standard French code and/or accent (what is call {{lang|fr-CI|chocoter}} in [[Ivorian French]]) will prompt addresses of {{lang|fr|vous}}, whereas [[code switching]] to Ivorian French will typically invite a concomitant switch to {{lang|fr|tu}}.

Informed local people will still, most of the time, make a conscious effort to use {{lang|fr|vous}} and {{lang|fr|monsieur}}/{{lang|fr|madame}} when addressing Westerners in formal situations (unless, again, that Westerner talks Ivorian French rather than Standard French). Other groups of foreigners such as other Africans, Asians or Middle-Eastern people are less likely to enjoy that "privilege".

The use of {{lang|fr|vous}}, just like the use of {{lang|fr|monsieur}} and {{lang|fr|madame}}, is thus restricted to very formal situations where Standard French is being used, mostly for the higher class between themselves: managers at a meeting with the CEO, representatives of different political parties, upper class people who don't know each other at a social gathering. A switching to {{lang|fr|tu}} can still happen as soon as the formal event is over (such as managers getting out of the meeting room) or just after having been introduced to each other – usually simultaneous to a switch from Standard French to Ivorian French.

==== Catalan ====
[[Catalan language|Catalan]] uses the singular pronouns {{lang|ca|tu}} (informal) and {{lang|ca|vostè}} (formal), while {{lang|ca|vosaltres}} (informal) and {{lang|ca|vostès}} (formal) are used for two or more addressees. The form {{lang|ca|vós}}, used instead of {{lang|ca|tu}} to address someone respectfully, follows the same concordance rules as the French {{lang|fr|vous}} (verbs in second person plural, adjectives in singular), and {{lang|ca|vostè}} follows the same concordance rules as the Spanish {{lang|es|usted}} (verbs in third person). {{lang|ca|Vostè}} originated from {{lang|ca|vostra mercè}} as a [[calque]] from Spanish, and replaced the original Catalan form {{lang|ca|vós}}.

In some dialects, {{lang|ca|vós}} is no longer used. Other dialects have a three-way distinction {{lang|ca|tu}} / {{lang|ca|vós}} / {{lang|ca|vostè}}, where {{lang|ca|vós}} is used as a respectful form for elders and respected friends, and {{lang|ca|vostè}} for foreigners and people whom one does not know well. {{lang|ca|Vostè}} is more distant than {{lang|ca|vós}}.

The Administration uses {{lang|ca|vós}} to address people.

==== Spanish ====
{{See also|Spanish dialects|voseo}}

In [[Peninsular Spanish|Peninsular]], [[Mexican Spanish|Mexican]], and [[Peruvian Spanish|Peruvian]] Spanish, as in [[#Italian|Italian]], an original {{lang|es|tú}} and {{lang|es|vos}} usage similar to [[#French|French]] disappeared in the [[Early Modern period]]. Today, {{lang|es|tú}} is used for informal and familiar address while the respectful form is the third-person {{lang|es|usted}}, which can be used respectfully to anyone. Scholars argue that {{lang|es|usted}} evolved as a contraction of the [[Old Spanish]] {{lang|osp|Vuestra Merced}} ("your mercy"), with {{lang|es|vusted}} as a transitional form. In some cases, the title {{lang|es|[[Don (honorific)|Don]]}} is also employed when speaking to a respected older man, while {{lang|es|Doña}} is used for older women.

Among [[Spanish dialects]], the situation is complicated by the fact that the [[Spanish Empire]] was created during the middle of this linguistic shift, leading to differing linguistic norms being established across its territory. The region surrounding the [[Colombia]]n capital of [[Bogotá]] (although not the city itself) preserves an alternate respectful form {{lang|es-CO|sumercé}} simplified from a different contraction of {{lang|es|vuestra merced}}. In [[Rioplatense]], {{lang|es|vos}} was preserved — but as a replacement for {{lang|es|tú}} and not as a respectful form of address; in [[Chilean Spanish|Chile]], in Western [[Venezuela]], parts of [[Colombia]] and in [[Central American Spanish|Central America]], {{lang|es|vos}} is used in spoken address and {{lang|es|tú}} is used in print and to express moderate formality, that is, it has essentially switched its function to the former role of {{lang|es|vos}}. In [[Costa Rica]] and part of Colombia, {{lang|es|usted}} is used as the common pronoun, using it both in formal and informal situations.

In the second-person plural, modern Spanish speakers in most of [[Spain]] employ {{lang|es-ES|vosotros}} (masculine) and {{lang|es-ES|vosotras}} (feminine) informally and (as the third-person plural) {{lang|es-ES|ustedes}} to express respect. In western [[Andalusian Spanish|Andalucia]], {{lang|es|ustedes}} is used in both contexts, but its verbs are conjugated in the second-person plural. Throughout the Americas and the [[Canarian Spanish|Canaries]], {{lang|es|ustedes}} is used in all contexts and in the third person.

==== Portuguese ====
{{See also|Portuguese personal pronouns}}

===== European Portuguese =====
In [[European Portuguese]] (as well as in [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|Africa]], [[Timor-Leste]] and [[Macau]]), {{lang|pt|tu}} (singular "you") is commonly used as the familiar addressing pronoun, while {{lang|pt|você}} is a general form of address; {{lang|pt|vocês}} (plural both of {{lang|pt|tu}} and {{lang|pt|você}}) is used for both familiar and general. The forms {{lang|pt|o senhor}} and {{lang|pt|a senhora}} (plurals {{lang|pt|os senhores}} and {{lang|pt|as senhoras}}) are used for more formal situations (roughly equivalent to "Mr/Sir" and "Mrs/Madam".) Similarly to some Romance languages (e.g. Italian), {{lang|pt|tu}} can be omitted because the verb ending provides the necessary information. Not so much so with {{lang|pt|você}} or {{lang|pt|o senhor}} / {{lang|pt|a senhora}} because the verb ending is the same as for the third person (historically, {{lang|pt|você}} derives from {{lang|pt|vossa mercê}} ("your mercy" or "your grace") via the intermediate forms {{lang|pt|vossemecê}} and {{lang|pt|vosmecê}}). The second person plural pronoun {{lang|pt|vós}}, from Latin {{lang|la|vos}}, is archaic in most of the Portuguese-speaking world, but can be heard in liturgy and has a limited regional use.

===== Brazilian Portuguese =====
In [[Brazilian Portuguese]], {{lang|pt|você}} and {{lang|pt|vocês}} (singular and plural "you", respectively) are used informally, while {{lang|pt|o senhor}} and {{lang|pt|a senhora}} ("Mr"/"Sir" and "Mrs"/"Madam", plurals {{lang|pt|os senhores}} and {{lang|pt|as senhoras}}) are used in formal speech. Although now seen as archaic, {{lang|pt|a senhorita}} is used when speaking ironically, very formally or when one is demonstrating respect to a superior and it is sometimes replaced by {{lang|pt-BR|moça}} ("Lady"). Informal terms of respect to superiors, elders or strangers are {{lang|pt-BR|Seu}} (abbreviation of {{lang|pt|senhor}}) and {{lang|pt|Dona}} (feminine of {{lang|pt|Dom}} i.e. {{lang|pt|Don}}). {{lang|pt-BR|Moço}}/{{lang|pt-BR|rapaz}} and {{lang|pt-BR|moça}} ("Lad"/"Young man" and "Lady") are used by seniors when addressing non-intimate youths and also as an equalizing form among strange youths. {{lang|pt-BR|Jovem}} ("youngster") is used in the same manner by elders when addressing strange youths of both genders.

On premises where the atmosphere requires extreme formality like the Senate or different courts, the protocolar forms to address dignitaries {{lang|pt|Vossa Excelência}} ("Your Excellence") and {{lang|pt|Vossa Senhoria}} ("Your Lordship/Ladyship") can still be heard. In a direct address to a judge or the president, {{lang|pt|Vossa Excelência}} must follow the vocatives {{lang|pt|Meritíssimo/a}} ("Your Honour", literally "full of merit") and {{lang|pt|Sr/Sra Presidente}} ("Mr/Mrs" President). When addressing an ecclesiastical dignitary the form {{lang|pt|Vossa Reverência}} ("Your Reverence") is used. Although {{lang|pt|Vossa Senhoria}} is regarded as protocolar, it is an equalizing form.

In many parts of the geographic extension of the language e.g. most of [[South Region, Brazil|Southern]] and [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern]] Brazil, some [[sociolect]]s of coastal São Paulo, mainly in Greater [[Santos (São Paulo)|Santos]], colloquial {{lang|pt-BR|[[carioca]]}} sociolect, mainly among the less educated and some all-[[social class|class]] [[youth]]s of [[Greater Rio de Janeiro]], and in [[Riverense Portuñol language|Uruguay]], ''tu'' (singular "you" or simply "thou") is used informally, but the plural form is always {{lang|pt|vocês}}. For the overwhelmingly majority of people, the pronoun {{lang|pt|tu}} is commonly used with the verb conjugated as {{lang|pt|você}} (third-person singular) rather than in the traditional conjugation (second-person singular). {{lang|pt|Tu}} is somewhat familiar, even intimate, and should never be addressed to superiors, or strange elders, while {{lang|pt|você}} is much more neutral, although equalizing.

The dialect that includes {{lang|pt-BR|[[Florianópolis]]|italic=no}}, capital city of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], as well as its shore and inner regions in the proximity like [[Blumenau]], is an exception, as the use of {{lang|pt|tu}} is widespread, even addressing formally to an authority or to a superior. It is one of the few dialects in [[Brazil]] in which second-person singular agreement is used (along with the relatively conservative dialect of the state of {{lang|pt-BR|Maranhão|italic=no}}).

==== Italian ====
In [[Standard Italian]] the informal second-person singular pronoun is {{lang|it|tu}} and the formal second-person singular pronoun is {{lang|it|Lei}} (&lt;small&gt;inf.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"she", &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"her"), always used with the third-person singular conjugation of the verb. The pronouns may be freely omitted.&lt;ref&gt;As especially polite alternatives, one may capitalize the pronoun to {{lang|it|Lei}} or use {{lang|it|Ella}} (lit.&amp;nbsp;"She"); both sound quite archaic. If the pronoun is capitalized, the majuscule is applied to all its forms including the [[enclitic]]s: {{lang|it|...vorrei incontrarLa per parlarGliene}} ("I would like to talk to you about it").&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the original meaning of {{lang|it|lei}}, modern Italian typically [[agreement (linguistics)|concords]] with the gender of the addressee when {{lang|it|lei}} is the sentence subject; using feminine adjectives for a male addressee is not especially insulting but sounds confusing, literary or even archaic. When {{lang|it|lei}} is an object, using feminine adjectives is normal ({{lang|it|l'ho vista}}, i.e. "I saw you (m.)"), whereas gender concord is considered non-standard ({{lang|it|l'ho visto}}, i.e. "I saw you (m.)).

{{lang|it|Lei}} is normally used in formal settings or with strangers, although it implies a sense of distance (even coldness) similar to the [[#French|French]] use of {{lang|fr|vous}}. Presently Italian adults prefer to employ {{lang|it|tu}} towards strangers until around 30 years old. It is used reciprocally between adults; the usage may not be reciprocal when young people address older strangers or otherwise respected people. Students are addressed with {{lang|it|tu}} by their teachers until the end of high school with few exceptions and usually with {{lang|it|Lei}} in universities. Students might use {{lang|it|tu}} with their teachers in elementary school, but switch to {{lang|it|Lei}} from middle school. {{lang|it|Tu}} is the common form of address on the Internet&lt;ref name="bbcnewsmag lawn 2012" /&gt; and within some professions {{ndash}} such as journalism and law {{ndash}} as a recognition of comradeship. In the law however the {{lang|it|tu}} is only used in informal settings; in the courtroom it is used only to small children, if ever any happens to appear there. The second-person plural pronoun is {{lang|it|voi}}. Its polite counterpart was formerly {{lang|it|Loro}} ("They"), but it is now little used outside of self-consciously formal situations such as expensive restaurants.

{{wikt-lang|it|Voi}} is the traditional polite form of address in [[Tuscan dialect]]s: [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] employs it in his 14th-century ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' when showing particular respect.&lt;ref&gt;As when meeting his former teacher: {{lang|it|Siete Voi qui, ser Brunetto?}} ("Are you here, sir Brunetto?").&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|it|Lei}} began to replace it during the [[Renaissance]] and then, under [[#Spanish|Spanish]] [[Sack of Rome (1527)|influence]], it became common to contract obsequious honorifics such as "Your Lordship", "Eminence", and "Majesty", all of which are feminine third-person singular nouns in Italian ({{lang|it|Vostra Signoria}}, {{lang|it|Eminenza}}, {{lang|it|Maestà}}). Over the next four centuries, all three pronouns — {{lang|it|tu}}, {{lang|it|Voi}}, {{lang|it|Lei}} — were employed together to express degrees of formality and status, as displayed in [[Alessandro Manzoni|Manzoni]]'s 19th-century ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]''. {{lang|it|Voi}} continues to be used by some speakers, particularly of [[Regional Italian|Southern dialects]], as an alternative to {{lang|it|Lei}} in polite address, but its use is increasingly uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Serianni |first=Luca |title= La Crusca per voi |url= http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/it/lingua-italiana/consulenza-linguistica/domande-risposte/allocutivi-cortesia |issue=no. 20 |date= April 2000 |language=it }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of {{lang|it|Voi}} was imposed by the [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascists]] from 1938 to 1944. {{lang|it|Voi}} still appears in comics, and in instruction books and advertisements where {{lang|it|Lei}} would sound too distant, but in the latter case most of the time it is used directly as a plural and not as a polite singular. (An example of all three forms of address in action is the Italian ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' translation: a character such as Aragorn is usually addressed as {{lang|it|lei}}, but neither {{lang|it|lei}} nor {{lang|it|tu}} seemed appropriate for how Samwise addresses his higher-class friend and employer Frodo; Sam calls Frodo {{lang|it|voi}}, in consequence.)

Although seldom encountered, the third person {{lang|it|la Signoria Vostra}} or {{lang|it|la S.V.}} ("Your Lord-" or "Ladyship") is sometimes seen in formal correspondence and invitations, as a stronger form of its descendant {{lang|it|lei}}.

==== Romanian ====
The [[Romanian language|Romanian]] word {{wikt-lang|ro|dumneavoastră}} when used for the second-person singular formal takes plural verbs but singular adjectives, similar to French {{lang|fr|vous}}. It is used roughly in the same manner as in Continental French and shows no signs of disappearing. It is also used as a more formal {{wikt-lang|ro|voi}}. It originates from {{lang|ro|domnia voastră}} – your lordship. In the past it was used extreme rarely to nobles especially, but its sense extended to other people in the 20th century but not so common and when the communists arrived it took the actual form.{{clarify|date=April 2017}}{{cn|date=April 2017}} As happens with all subject pronouns, {{lang|ro|dumneavoastră}} is often omitted from sentences, its use being implied by verbs in the second person plural form.

The form {{wikt-lang|ro|dumneata}} (originating from {{lang|ro|domnia ta}} – thy lordship) is less distant than {{lang|ro|dumneavoastră}} and somewhat midway between {{lang|ro|tu}} and {{lang|ro|dumneavoastră}}. The verb is conjugated, as for {{lang|ro|tu}}, in the second person singular form. Older people towards younger people and peers favor {{lang|ro|dumneata}}. Its use is gradually declining.

A more colloquial form of {{lang|ro|dumneata}} is {{wikt-lang|ro|mata}}, {{wikt-lang|ro|matale}} or {{wikt-lang|ro|tălică}}. It is more familiar than {{lang|ro|tu}} and is used only in some regions of Romania. It is used only with immediate family members, and is spelled and pronounced the same in all cases, similar to {{lang|ro|dumneavoastră}}. It is used with verbs in the second person singular, as is {{lang|ro|tu}}.

The plural form is a recent borrowing. [[Proto-Romanian language|Proto-Romanian]] and [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], like Classical Latin, do not have the plural form.

==== Sicilian ====
Most dialects of Sicilian Language have utilised {{lang|scn|vussìa}}, {{lang|scn|vossìa}}, or {{lang|scn|vassa}} to express formality. However, due to encroachment by Italian language {{lang|it|Lei}} has become increasingly common particularly among younger speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Introduction to Sicilian Grammar |last=Cipolla |first=Gaetano |publisher=Legas |year= |isbn=1881901254 |pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hellenic ===
==== Ancient and Hellenistic or Koine Greek ====
In [[Ancient Greek]], {{lang|grc-Latn|sý}} ({{lang|grc|σύ}}) was the singular, and {{lang|grc-Latn|hymeis}} ({{lang|grc|ὑμεῖς}}) the plural, with no distinction for honorific or familiar. [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] addresses King [[Agrippa II]] as {{lang|grc-Latn|sý}} ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 26:2).

Later, {{lang|grc-Latn|hymeís}} and {{lang|grc-Latn|hēmeís}} ({{lang|grc|ἡμεῖς}},"we") became too close in pronunciation, and a new plural {{lang|grc-Latn|seís}} or {{lang|grc-Latn|eseís}} ({{lang|grc|σεις}}/{{lang|grc|εσείς}}) was invented, the initial {{lang|grc-Latn|e}} ({{lang|grc|ε}}) being a [[euphony|euphonic]] prefix that was also extended to the singular ({{lang|grc-Latn|sý}}/{{lang|grc-Latn|esý}}).

==== Modern Greek ====
In [[Greek language|Modern Greek]], {{lang|el|εσείς}} ({{lang|el-Latn|eseís}}, second person plural) with second person plural verb conjugation is used as the formal counterpart of {{lang|el|εσύ}} ({{lang|el-Latn|esý}}, second person singular) when talking to strangers and elders, although in everyday life it is common to speak to strangers of your age or younger using the singular pronoun. In addition, the informal second person singular is used even with older people you are acquainted with, depending on the level of mutual familiarity.

Since the formal {{lang|el|εσείς}} ({{lang|el-Latn|eseís}}) has become less common outside schools and workplaces, many people often do not know which form to use (because using a formal version might sound too snobbish even to an elder and using the informal version might sound inappropriate to some strangers) and thus prefer to replace verbs with nouns (avoiding the dilemma) until enough information on the counterpart's intentions is gathered in order to choose between formal or informal second person pronoun and verb conjugation. A good rule of thumb is that singular accompanies first names and plural accompanies surnames with title (Mr, Mrs, etc.). Exceptions are rare, for example younger schoolchildren may address their teacher in the plural, title and ''first name'', or an officer may address a soldier in the singular and surname. The sequence singular-title-surname is a faux pas that can often indicate lack of education, of good manners, or of both.

The modern [[social custom]] when using Greek in Greece is to ask the other person "may we speak in the singular?" in which the other person is expected to answer "yes" and afterwards the discussion continues using the informal {{lang|el|εσύ}} ({{lang|el-Latn|esý}}); it is unthinkable for the other person to answer "no" or show preference for plural forms, and for this reason one should not even ask this question to a person of high status, such as a professional. Therefore, asking this question can itself be considered a form of disrespect in some social situations. Likewise, not asking this question and simply using the singular without prior explicit or implicit agreement would also be considered disrespectful in various social contingencies. In other cases, even using the formal plural (without a question) could also be considered offensive. A person being inappropriately addressed in the singular will often indicate their displeasure by insisting on responding in the plural, in a display of irony that may or may not be evident to the other party. A similar social custom exists with the words {{lang|el|κύριε}} ([[Mr]]/[[Sir]]) and {{lang|el|κυρία}} ([[Mrs]]/[[Madam]]), which can show both respect and a form of "mock respect" essentially communicating disapproval, often depending on the voice intonation and the social situation. Overall, the distinction between formal and informal forms of address and when to use each can be quite subtle and not easily discernible by a non-native speaker.

[[Cypriot Greek]] traditionally had no T–V distinction, with even persons of very high social status addressed in the singular, usually together with an honorific or title such as {{lang|el-CY|δάσκαλε}} ("teacher", mainly for priests) or {{lang|el-CY|μάστρε}} (literally "master", loosely "sir"). Even today, the singular form is used much more frequently in [[Cyprus]] compared to Greece, although this is changing under the influence of [[Standard Modern Greek]]. The plural form is now expected in a formal setting.

=== Celtic ===
==== Scottish Gaelic ====
In [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]], the informal form of the second-person singular is {{lang|gd|thu}}/{{lang|gd|tu}} (emphatic: {{lang|gd|thusa}}/{{lang|gd|tusa}}), used when addressing a person the speaker knows well, or when addressing a person younger or relatively the same age as the speaker. When addressing a superior, an elder, or a stranger, or in conducting business, the form {{lang|gd|sibh}} (emphatic: {{lang|gd|sibhse}}) is used. ({{lang|gd|Sibh}} is also the second person plural). This distinction carries over into [[conjugated preposition|prepositional pronouns]]: for instance, {{lang|gd|agad}} and {{lang|gd|agaibh}} (at you), {{lang|gd|riut}} and {{lang|gd|ribh}} (against you), {{lang|gd|romhad}} and {{lang|gd|romhaibh}} (before you), etc., and into [[possessive pronoun]]s {{lang|gd|do}} and {{lang|gd|ur}} (your).

==== Irish ====
In Irish, the use of {{lang|ga|sibh}} as an address to one person has died out, and {{lang|gd|tú}} is preferred. Formerly, [[Roman Catholic]] priests were addressed with the plural form {{lang|gd|sibh}}, especially in Ulster, due to the possibility that the priest may be carrying the [[Eucharist]] on his person—belief in the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]] would require the use of the plural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Subject: Re: sibh &amp; thu |publisher=GAELIC-L Archives |date=29 October 1991 |url=https://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9110&amp;L=gaelic-l&amp;P=16479 |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Welsh, Cornish and Breton ====
Modern [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Breton language|Breton]] all retain a T–V distinction to varying degrees.

In spoken Welsh, the plural pronoun {{lang|cy|chi}} is used when speaking to strangers, elders or superiors, while {{lang|cy|ti}} (or {{lang|cy|chdi}} in some parts of the North) is used with friends, close family, animals and children. {{lang|cy|Ti}} is also the form used when addressing God. Nonetheless, the use of {{lang|cy|chi}} and {{lang|cy|ti}} varies between families and regions, but those guidelines are generally observed.&lt;ref name="JonesWelsh"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ceri Jones |title=Dweud Eich Dweud: A Guide to Colloquial and Idiomatic Welsh |year=2013 |location=Llandysul, Ceredigion |publisher=Gwasg Gomer |origyear=2001 |page=204 }}, which also cites {{cite book |author=Dic Jones |title=Os Hoffech Wybod |edition=1st |location=Caernarfon, Gwynedd |publisher=Gwasg Gwynedd |year=1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lang|cy|Chwi}} is an alternative to {{lang|cy|chi}} found in very formal literary language. Alongside the usages explained above, [[Silent Generation|those born before 1945]] would, in their youth, use {{lang|cy|chi}} with a girl of about the same age.&lt;ref name="JonesWelsh"/&gt; Similarly to [[Italian language|Italian]], the third person singular is used by some speakers in the former [[Dyfed]] region of west Wales; it appears, however, that the pronoun used – between either {{lang|cy|e}} or {{lang|cy|fe}} (masculine, South), {{lang|cy|o}} or {{lang|cy|fo}} (masculine, North) and {{lang|cy|hi}} (feminine) – depends on the gender of the listener.&lt;ref name="JonesWelsh"/&gt;

A similar distinction exists between Cornish singular {{lang|kw|ty}} / {{lang|kw|chy}} and plural {{lang|kw|hwi}} / {{lang|kw|whi}}. The singular form is used when talking to friends, family, animals and children, and the plural form is used to talk to a group of people, or when being especially polite to one person.

In Breton the second person plural {{lang|kw|c'hwi}} is used as a polite form when addressing a single person and the singular {{lang|kw|te}} is reserved for informal situations. However, in a large area of central Brittany the singular form has been entirely replaced by {{lang|kw|c'hwi}}, as in English.

==== Russian and Ukrainian (mainly Eastern) ====
Modern [[Russian language|Russian]] distinguishes between the familiar '''{{lang|ru-Latn|ty}}''' ({{lang|ru|ты}}) and the respectful '''{{lang|ru-Latn|vy}}''' ({{lang|ru|вы}}), the latter also being the plural of both forms. (Respectful {{lang|ru-Latn|Vy}} ({{lang|ru|Вы}}) may be capitalised in written correspondence, while plural {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} is not.) The distinction appeared relatively recently and began to gain currency among the educated classes in the 18th century through French influence.&lt;ref name="popov"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/307220?uid=3738200&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103199636893 On the origin of Russian ''Vy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} is used among friends and relatives, but the usage depends not only on the closeness of the relationship but also on age and the formality of the situation (e.g., work meeting vs. a party). Children always use {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} to address each other and are addressed in this way by adults but are taught to address adults with {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}}. Younger adults typically also address older adults outside the family as {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} regardless of intimacy, and may be addressed as {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} in return. When talking to each other young people often start with the formal {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} but may transition to {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} very quickly in an informal situation. Among older people, {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} is often reserved for closer acquaintances. Unless there is a substantial difference in age, the choice of the form is symmetric: if A uses {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} to address B, then B also uses {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} to address A. While people may transition quickly from {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} to {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}}, such transition presumes mutual agreement. Use of {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} without consent of the other person is likely to be viewed as poor conduct or even as an insult (or, in the case of opposite-sexed people, overly flirtatious), particularly if the other party maintains using {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}}.

Historically, the rules used to be more [[estates of the realm|class]]-specific: as late as at the end of the 19th century, it was accepted in some circles (in aristocracy and especially gentry) that {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} was to be used also between friends, between husband and wife, and when addressing one's parents (but not one's children), all of which situations today would strongly call for using {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}}. Meanwhile, up to this day, common people, especially those living in rural areas, hardly ever use the polite {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}}.&lt;ref name="popov" /&gt; Russian speakers online uphold the distinction and mainly use {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} for strangers, although in the earlier days of internet it was more common and expected to use {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} to address everyone.

The choice between {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} and {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} is closely related to, yet sometimes different from, the choice of the addressing format – that is, the selection from the first name, [[patronymics]], last name, and the title to be used when addressing the person. Normally, {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} is associated with the informal addressing by first name only (or, even more informally, by the patronymic only), whereas {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} is associated with the more formal addressing format of using the first name together with patronymics (roughly analogous to "title followed by last name" in English) or the last name together with a title (the last name is almost never used together with either of the other two names to ''address'' someone, although such combinations are routinely used to ''introduce'' or ''mention'' someone). However, nowadays, {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} can also be employed while addressing by first name only.

In Ukrainian, the present practice is essentially the same as in Russian, historically this was primarily in the Eastern, Russian-ruled part of Ukraine. Until about 1945, due to Polish influence, the practices in the former [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Volhynia|Volyn]] regions, tended to more closely resemble the Polish practices, as described below. But since those areas became annexed to the Soviet Union, the East Ukrainian and Russian practices have become prevalent all over Ukraine, with the {{lang|uk|панство}} {{lang|uk-Latn|panstvo}}, {{lang|uk|прошу пана}} {{lang|uk-Latn|proshu pana}}, {{lang|uk|прошу пани}} {{lang|uk-Latn|proshu pani}}, etc. forms only being preserved in the émigré diaspora.

==== Serbo-Croatian ====
In all standard forms of [[Serbo-Croatian]], i.e. [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], the use of {{lang|sh|ti}} is limited to friends and family, and used among children. In any formal use, {{lang|sh|vi}}, the second-person plural, is used only;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |language=German |title=Wörter im Grenzbereich von Lexikon und Grammatik im Serbokroatischen |trans-title=Serbo-Croatian Words on the Border Between Lexicon and Grammar |url= |series=Studies in Slavic Linguistics ; 18 |location=Munich |publisher=Lincom Europa |year=2001 |pages=37–48 |isbn=3-89586-954-6 |lccn=2005530313 |oclc=47905097 |ol=2863539W}} [https://www.webcitation.org/6A80Mj8Bf?url=http://www.snjezana-kordic.de/Summary_Worter.pdf Summary].&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|sh|ti}} can be used among peers in a workplace but is rare in official documents. It is a common misconception, even among native speakers, that {{lang|sh|vi}} is always capitalized when used in formal tone; {{lang|sh|Vi}} is capitalized only in direct personal correspondence between two persons.

With the polite {{lang|sh|vi}}, masculine plural (in participles and adjectives) is used regardless of the sex of the person addressed.

==== Bulgarian ====
[[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] distinguishes between familiar {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} ({{lang|bg|ти}}) and respectful {{lang|bg-Latn|Vie}} ({{lang|bg|Вие}}). {{lang|bg-Latn|Ti}} is always singular and implies familiarity. {{lang|bg-Latn|Vie}}, the plural of {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}}, also functions as the formal singular.

In addressing more than one person, the plural {{lang|bg-Latn|vie}} is always used. For example, {{lang|bg|'''Вие''' двамата напуснете, моля!}}" means "''You'' two leave, please!"). Here, although {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} and {{lang|bg-Latn|vie}} both means ''you'', {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} can not be used.

When addressing a single person, if the people talking are acquainted then singular {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} is used, otherwise plural {{lang|bg-Latn|Vie}} should be used. Sometimes people start a new acquaintance straightforwardly with singular {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}}, but generally this is considered offensive, rude, or simply impolite. Children are taught to always use {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} between themselves, but {{lang|bg-Latn|Vie}} for addressing more than one child or an unknown adult.

The grammatically correct spelling of the singular word {{lang|bg-Latn|Vie}} is always with a capital letter, whether being the first word in a sentence or not. For example, the sentence "But ''you'' are wrong!", if spelled (in Bulgarian) {{lang|bg|Но '''Вие''' грешите!}} (the word {{lang|bg|Вие}} with capital {{lang|bg|В}}), it would convey that the speaker is addressing an individual person with a plural, because he/she wants to express a polite, official manner; if spelt {{lang|bg|Но '''вие''' грешите!}} (the second possible Bulgarian translation of "But ''you'' are wrong!"), it would then mean that someone is talking to several persons.

Generally, {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} is used among friends and relatives. When talking to each other, young people often start with the formal {{lang|bg-Latn|vie}} but quickly transition to {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} in an informal situation. Unless there is a substantial difference in social situation (e.g. a teacher and a student), the choice of the form is symmetric: if A. uses {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} to address B., then B. also uses {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} to address A. While people may transition quickly from {{lang|bg-Latn|vie}} to {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}}, such transition presumes mutual agreement. There is a recent trend not to use the formal {{lang|bg-Latn|Vie}} at all, but this can lead to awkward situations.

==== Macedonian ====
[[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] distinguishes between familiar {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} ({{lang|mk|ти}}) and respectful {{lang|mk-Latn|vie}} ({{lang|mk|вие}}) – which is also the plural of both forms, used to address a pair or group. (Respectful {{lang|mk-Latn|Vie}} may be capitalized, while plural {{lang|mk-Latn|vie}} is not.) Generally, {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} is used among friends and relatives, but the usage depends not only on the closeness of the relationship but also on age and the formality of the situation (e.g., work meeting vs. a party). Children always use {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} to address each other and are addressed in this way by adults, but are taught to address adults with {{lang|mk-Latn|vie}}. Younger adults typically also address older adults outside the family as {{lang|mk-Latn|vie}} regardless of intimacy, and may be addressed as {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} in return. When talking to each other young people often start with the formal {{lang|mk-Latn|vie}}, but may transit to {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} very quickly in an informal situation. Among older people, {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} is often reserved for closer acquaintances. Unless there is a substantial difference in age, the choice of the form is symmetric: if A uses {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} to address B, then B also uses {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} to address A. While people may transit quickly from {{lang|mk-Latn|vie}} to {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}}, such transition presumes mutual agreement. Use of {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} without consent of the other person is likely to be viewed as poor conduct or even as an insult, particularly if the other party maintains using {{lang|mk-Latn|vie}}.

==== Polish ====
{{Main|Polish name#Formal and informal use|Honorifics (linguistics)#Polish|l2=Polish honorifics}}

Polish uses as formal forms the words {{lang|pl|pan}} (meaning "mister" or "gentleman") and {{lang|pl|pani}} ("lady"), and in the plural {{lang|pl|panowie}} ("gentlemen") and {{lang|pl|panie}} ("ladies") respectively, {{lang|pl|państwo}} being used for mixed groups (originally a neutral noun, meaning roughly "lordship", but also, and until today, "state"). {{lang|pl|Państwo}} is used with the plural, like {{lang|pl|panowie}} and {{lang|pl|panie}}. Because of their character as nouns (and not pronouns) these words are used with the third person: For example, the familiar {{lang|pl|Chcesz pić}} ("You want to drink") becomes {{lang|pl|Pan chce pić}} (literally "The gentleman wants to drink").

Further, {{lang|pl|pan}} and {{lang|pl|pani}} can be combined with the first name, the last name and with titles like "President", "Professor", "Doctor", "Editor" and others ({{lang|pl|Pan Prezydent}}, {{lang|pl|pani profesor}} etc.; using these titles is considered necessary); using both ({{lang|pl|Pan Prezydent Kowalski}}, {{lang|pl|pani profesor Nowak}}) is considered more polite or, in some context, even submissive. Addressing a present person with the last name is only usual in court or in other affairs, where government authority is involved, and generally considered impolite or condescending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://poradnia.pwn.pl/lista.php?id=12364 |title=Szanowny Panie Kowalski! |website=Poradnia językowa PWN |accessdate=1 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When addressing someone, all these forms always require the [[vocative]] case, which is otherwise optional (for example {{lang|pl|panie Kowalski}} ("Mr Kowalski!"), {{lang|pl|pani Joanno}} ("Mrs Joanna!"), {{lang|pl|panie profesorze}} ("Professor!")). For {{lang|pl|pan}}, {{lang|pl|pani}} etc. alone, {{lang|pl|proszę}} + [[genitive]] is used instead of vocative: {{lang|pl|proszę pana}}, {{lang|pl|proszę pani}}, {{lang|pl|proszę panów}}, {{lang|pl|proszę pań}} and {{lang|pl|proszę państwa}}.

A unique practice among both Poles and Western Ukrainians is addressing a lawyer as {{lang|pl|pan Mecenas}}, meaning "Mr. Philanthropist", derived from the name of an ancient Greek king known for his generosity.

The V-forms are capitalized only in actual letters (or e-mails), where the T-forms {{lang|pl|ty}} and {{lang|pl|wy}} are also capitalized.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Plural {{lang|pl|wy}} is also used as V-form in dialects, for example {{lang|pl|Matko, co wy jecie?}} ("Mother, what are you eating?").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Dialekty i gwary polskie|author1=S. Dubisz |author2=H. Karaś |author3=N. Kolis |isbn=83-214-0989-X|chapter=Pluralis maiestaticus|year=1995|location=Warszawa|publisher=Wiedza Powszechna|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following its Russian usage, the plural V-form was also promoted in the Polish language [[Polish People's Republic|from 1945]], becoming associated with Communist ideology and addressing of a person by a government or Party official.

Besides, other forms can be sometimes used like {{lang|pl|pan}} in third person when talking to older family members ({{lang|pl|Niech mama powie}}, "May mother say"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poradnia.pwn.pl/lista.php?id=4114|title=Jak to w rodzinie…|website=Poradnia językowa PWN|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to clergy ({{lang|pl|Tak, dobrze ksiądz trafił}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.piszmy.pl/agata-podniosla-sie-ze-swojego-fotela/Chapter.html|title=Agata podniosła się ze swojego fotela…|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Yes, priest got it right") or to other people in less formal or semi-formal situations, e.g. polite quarrel or dispute ({{lang|pl|Zatem – proszę kolegi – niech kolega się trochę douczy, a potem poucza innych}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ask.fm/justlikethat3/answer/110875416461 |title=ask.fm/Kuebonafide ---- :* ! |accessdate=1 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140429191953/http://ask.fm/justlikethat3/answer/110875416461 |archivedate=29 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Also, may my dear friend please learn more and only then instruct others").

==== Slovene ====
[[File:Jozef Nahtigal tombstone in Dobrova Slovenia.jpg|thumb|220px|Tombstone of {{lang|sl|[[Jožef Nahtigal]]|italic=no}} in {{lang|sl|[[Dobrova, Dobrova – Polhov Gradec|Dobrova]]|italic=no}} with archaic Slovene {{lang|sl|onikanje}} in indirect reference. Literal translation "Here lie [{{lang|sl|počivajo}}] the honorable {{lang|sl|Jožef Nahtigal|italic=no}} … they were born [{{lang|sl|rojeni}}] … they died [{{lang|sl|umerli}}] … God grant them [{{lang|sl|jim}}] eternal peace and rest."]]
In [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], although informal address using the second person singular {{lang|sl|ti}} form (known as {{lang|sl|tikanje}}) is officially limited to friends and family, talk among children, and addressing animals, it is increasingly used instead of its polite or formal counterpart using the second person plural {{lang|sl|vi}} form (known as {{lang|sl|vikanje}}).

There is an additional nonstandard but widespread use of a singular participle combined with a plural auxiliary verb (known as {{lang|sl|polvikanje}}) that also reveals the gender of the person and is used in somewhat less formal situations:

* {{lang|sl|Vi ga niste videli.}} ('You did not see him': both the auxiliary verb {{lang|sl|niste}} and the participle {{lang|sl|videli}} are plural masculine.)
* {{lang|sl|Vi ga niste videl/videla.}} ('You did not see him': the auxiliary verb {{lang|sl|niste}} is plural but the participle {{lang|sl|videl/videla}} is singular masculine/feminine.)

The use of the third person plural {{lang|sl|oni}} form (known as {{lang|sl|onikanje}} in both direct address and indirect reference) as an ultra-polite form is now archaic or dialectal; it is associated with servant-master relationships in older literature, the child-parent relationship in certain conservative rural communities, and in general with relationships with people of highest respect (parents, clergy, royalty).

==== Czech ====
{{refimprove section|date=July 2011}}
{{See also|Czech verb}}
In [[Czech language|Czech]], there are three levels of formality. The most formal is using the second person plural verb forms (V form) with the surname or title of the addressed person, usual between strangers or people in a professional relationship. The second common form is made by using the second person singular verb forms (T form) together with the given name of the other person, used between friends and in certain social groups (students etc.). The third form, which is rather less common, is using the V form in combination with the given name. It may be used by a teacher when addressing a student (especially at the secondary school level), by a boss addressing their secretary, or in other relationships where a certain degree of familiarity has developed, but has not superseded some level of mutually acknowledged respect or distance. This form of address is usually asymmetrical (the perceived social superior uses V form in combination with the first name, the perceived social inferior using V form and the surname or honorific), less often symmetrical. Using the singular verb forms together with the surname or title is considered very rude. Where a stranger introduces themself with title (like {{lang|cs|inženýr Novák}}, {{lang|cs|doktor Svoboda}}), it is considered more polite to address them using the V form in combination with their title (always preceded by the honorific {{lang|cs|paní}}/{{lang|cs|pane}}, i.e. Mr/Ms), rather than their surname. However, it is considered poor manners to address somebody with their title in combination with the T form.

Traditionally, use of the informal form was limited for relatives, very close friends, and for children. During the second half of the 20th century, use of the informal form grew significantly among coworkers, youth and members of organisations and groups. The formal form is always used in official documents and when dealing with a stranger (especially an older one) as a sign of respect. 2nd-person pronouns ({{lang|cs|Ty}}, {{lang|cs|Tvůj}}, {{lang|cs|Vy}}, {{lang|cs|Váš}}) are often capitalized in letters, advertisement, etc. The capitalization is optional and is slowly becoming obsolete. A variant of the formal form modeled after German {{lang|de|Sie}} ({{lang|cs|Oni}}/{{lang|cs|oni}}, {{lang|cs|Jejich}}/{{lang|cs|jejich}}, verb {{lang|cs|onikat}}) was frequently used during the 19th century but has since disappeared. This form is also associated with Czech [[Jew]]ish community before [[Second World War]], and still appears very often in [[Jewish humour]] as sign of local colour. Sometimes it is used as [[irony]].

In the Internet age, where people communicate under nicknames or pseudonymes and almost solely in informal way, capitalizing ({{lang|cs|ty}}/{{lang|cs|Ty}}) is used to emphasise respect, or simply presence of respect. ({{lang|cs|Ty}} = friends, honored acquaintance, strangers {{lang|cs|ty}} = basic form, {{lang|cs|vy}}/{{lang|cs|Vy}} = most formal, used to create distance or express contempt, very rude if not sufficiently advocated, often used as insult itself). {{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In grammar, plural forms are used in personal and possessive [[pronoun]]s ({{lang|cs|vy}} – you, {{lang|cs|váš}} – your) and in verbs, but not in [[participle]]s and [[adjective]]s, they are used in singular forms (when addressing a single person). This differs from some other [[Slavic languages]] ([[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Russian language|Russian]], etc.)

Greetings are also connected with T–V distinction.

==== Lithuanian ====
In [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], historically, aside from familiar {{lang|lt|tu}} and respectful {{lang|lt|jūs}} or {{lang|lt|Jūs}}, also used to express plural, there was a special form {{lang|lt|tamsta}}, mostly referred to in third person singular (although referring in second person singular is also not uncommon). This form was used to communicate with a stranger who has not earned particular respect (a beggar, for example). Modern Lithuanian Dictionary describes {{lang|lt|tamsta}} as a polite form of second singular person {{lang|lt|tu}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dz.lki.lt/get/87718/ |title=Dabartinės lietuvių kalbos žodynas |work=lki.lt }}&lt;/ref&gt; making its meaning somewhere in the middle between informal {{lang|lt|tu}} and formal {{lang|lt|jūs}}. Through the Soviet occupation period, however, this form was mostly replaced by standard neutral form {{lang|lt|drauge}} (the [[vocative case]] for {{lang|lt|draugas}}, "[[comrade]]", the latter being the standard formal form of addressing in all languages of the [[Soviet Union]] used in all situations, from "comrade [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]" to "comrade student"), and by now {{lang|lt|tamsta}} is used sparsely. A common way of addressing people whom one doesn't know well is also {{lang|lt|Ponas}} (m) and {{lang|lt|Ponia}} (f), from Polish forms of address {{wikt-lang|pl|pan}} and {{wikt-lang|pl|pani}}, respectively.

=== Indic ===
==== Hindi and Urdu ====
In the standard forms of both [[Standard Hindi|Hindi]] and [[Standard Urdu|Urdu]] there are three levels of honorifics:
* '''{{lang|hi|आप}} {{lang|ur|آپ}}''' {{lang|hi-Latn|āp}} {{IPA|[aːp]}}: The formal V-form used to address another person. Used with third-person verbs or separate honorific verb forms in all formal settings and when speaking to persons who are senior in age or social hierarchy. No difference between the singular and the plural; plural reference can, however, be indicated by the use of "you people" ({{lang|hi|आप लोग}} {{lang|ur|آپ لوگ}} {{lang|hi-Latn|āp log}}) or "you all" ({{lang|hi|आप सब}} {{lang|ur|آپ سب}} {{lang|hi-Latn|āp sab}}). It is sometimes combined with a second-person verb when speaking to persons lower in social hierarchy or, generally, to reduce distance while avoiding the informal flavour of {{lang|hi-Latn|tum}}.
* '''{{lang|hi|तुम}} {{lang|ur|تُم}}''' {{lang|hi-Latn|tum}} {{IPA|[tʊm]}}: Originally, a plural pronoun ("you"), it is nowadays used as singular V-form in all informal settings and when speaking to persons who are junior in age or social hierarchy. No difference between the singular and the plural; plural reference can, however, be indicated by the use of "you people" ({{lang|hi|तुम लोग}} {{lang|ur|تُم لوگ}} {{lang|hi-Latn|tum log}}) or "you all" ({{lang|hi|तुम सब}} {{lang|ur|تُم سب}} {{lang|hi-Latn|tum sab}}).
* '''{{lang|hi|तू}} {{lang|ur|تُو}}''' {{lang|hi-Latn|tū}} {{IPA|[tuː]}}: Originally, a singular pronoun ("thou"), it is nowadays used exclusively as a T-form, in extremely informal settings: to address own children, very close friends, or in poetic language (either with God or with lovers). When used to others (e.g., strangers), it is considered offensive both in Pakistan and India.

==== Bengali ====
[[Bengali language|Bengali]] has three levels of formality in its pronouns; the most neutral forms of address among closer members of a family are {{lang|bn|তুমি}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tumi}} and {{lang|bn|তোমরা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tomra}} (plural). These two pronouns are also typically used when speaking to children, or to younger members of the extended family. {{lang|bn|তুমি}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tumi}} is also used when addressing God. When speaking with adults outside the family, or with senior members of the extended family, the pronouns {{lang|bn|আপনি}} {{lang|bn-Latn|apni}} and {{lang|bn|আপনারা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|apnara}} (plural) are used. This is also true in advertisements and public announcements. A third set of pronouns, {{lang|bn|তুই}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tui}} and {{lang|bn|তোরা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tora}} (plural), is reserved for use between very close friends, and by extension, between relatives who share a bond not unlike a close friendship. It is also used when addressing people presumed to be of "inferior" social status; this latter use is occasionally used when speaking to housemaids, [[rickshaw]]-pullers, and other service workers, although this use is considered offensive.

The situations in which these different pronouns can be used vary considerably depending on many social factors. In some families, children may address their parents with {{lang|bn|আপনি}} {{lang|bn-Latn|apni}} and {{lang|bn|আপনারা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|apnara}}, although this is becoming increasingly rare. Some adults alternate between all three pronoun levels when speaking to children, normally choosing {{lang|bn|তুমি}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tumi}} and {{lang|bn|তোমরা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tomra}}, but also often choosing {{lang|bn|তুই}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tui}} and {{lang|bn|তোরা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tora}} to indicate closeness, or {{lang|bn|আপনি}} {{lang|bn-Latn|apni}} or {{lang|bn|আপনারা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|apnara}} in a joking manner. Additionally, Bengalis vary in which pronoun they use when addressing servants in the home; some may use {{lang|bn|আপনি}} {{lang|bn-Latn|apni}} and {{lang|bn|আপনারা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|apnara}} to indicate respect for an adult outside the family, while others may use {{lang|bn|তুমি}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tumi}} and {{lang|bn|তোমরা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tomra}} to indicate either inclusion into the family or to indicate somewhat less honorable status. Others may even use {{lang|bn|তুই}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tui}} and {{lang|bn|তোরা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tora}} to indicate inferior status.

==== Finnish ====
In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], today the use of the informal singular form of address ({{lang|fi|sinä}}) is widespread in all social circles, even among strangers and in business situations. The use of formal address has not disappeared however, and persists in situations involving customer service (especially if the customer is clearly older than the person serving them) and in general in addressing the elderly or in situations where strict adherence to form is expected, such as in the military. An increase in the use of formal address has been reported in recent years, whereby some people are choosing to use the formal form more often.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. As the use of the form conveys formal recognition of the addressee's status and, more correctly, of polite social distance, the formal form might also occasionally be used jeeringly or to protest the addressee's snobbery. A native speaker may also switch to formal form when speaking in anger, as an attempt to remain civil. Advertisements, instructions and other formal messages are mostly in informal singular form ({{lang|fi|sinä}} and its conjugations), but the use of formal forms has increased in recent years. For example, as the tax authorities tend to become more informal, in contrast the social security system is reverting to using the formal form.

The same forms, such as the pronoun {{lang|fi|te}}, are used for formal singular and for both formal and informal plural.

In Finnish the number is expressed in pronouns ({{lang|fi|sinä}} for second person singular, or {{lang|fi|te}} for second person plural), verb inflections, and [[possessive suffix]]es. Almost all of these elements follow the grammar of the second person plural also in the formal singular form. For example, polite {{lang|fi|Voisitteko (te) siirtää autonne}} vs. informal {{lang|fi|Voisitko (sinä) siirtää autosi}}, "Could you move your car, (please)?". Each of the person markers are modified: {{lang|fi|-t-}} to {{lang|fi|-tte-}} (verb person), {{lang|fi|sinä}} to {{lang|fi|te}} (pronoun), {{lang|fi|-si}} to {{lang|fi|-nne}} (possessive suffix).

As a few examples of this could be mentioned the way [[imperative mood|imperatives]] are expressed: {{lang|fi|Menkää!}} "Go!" (plural), vs. {{lang|fi|Mene!}} "Go!" (singular), and the usage of the plural suffix {{lang|fi|-nne}} "your" instead of the singular {{lang|fi|-si}} "your".

There is number agreement in Finnish, thus you say {{lang|fi|sinä olet}} "you are" (singular), but {{lang|fi|te olette}} "you are" (plural). However, this does not extend to words describing the addressee, which are in the singular, e.g. {{lang|fi|oletteko te lääkäri?}} "are you doctor?" (plural, plural, singular)

A common error, nowadays often made even by native speakers unused to the formal forms, is to use the plural form of the main verb in the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] and [[pluperfect]] constructions. The main verb should be in the singular when addressing one person in the formal plural: {{lang|fi|Oletteko kuullut?}} instead of {{lang|fi|*Oletteko kuulleet?}} "Have you heard?"

Sometimes the third person is used as a polite form of address, after the [[T–V distinction#Swedish|Swedish model]]: {{lang|fi|Mitä rouvalle saisi olla?}} "What would madam like to have?" This is far less common in the Eastern parts of Finland, influenced less by the Swedish language and all in all a declining habit. The [[passive voice]] may be used to circumvent the choice of the correct form of address. In another meaning, the passive voice is also the equivalent of the English patronizing ''we'' as in {{lang|fi|Kuinkas tänään voidaan?}} "How are we feeling today?"

Finnish language includes the verbs for calling one with informal singular or formal plural: {{lang|fi|sinutella}}, {{lang|fi|teititellä}}, respectively.

In the Bible and in the [[Kalevala]], only the "informal" singular is used in all cases.

==== Estonian ====
[[Estonian language|Estonian]] is a language with T–V distinction, second person plural ({{lang|et|teie}}) is used instead of second person singular ({{lang|et|sina}}) as a means of expressing politeness or formal speech. {{lang|et|Sina}} is the familiar form of address used with family, friends, and minors. The distinction is still much more widely used and more rigid than in closely related Finnish language.

Similar to the French language {{lang|fr|vouvoyer}}, the verb {{lang|et|teietama}} is used, and {{lang|et|teie}} is used when addressing a (new) customer or a patient, or when talking to a person in his/her function. In [[hierarchical organization]]s, like large businesses or armies, {{lang|et|sina}} is used between members of a same rank/level while {{lang|et|teie}} is used between members of different ranks. {{lang|et|Sina}} (the verb {{lang|et|sinatama}} is also used) is used with relatives, friends, when addressing children and with close colleagues. Borderline situations, such as distant relatives, young adults, customers in rental shops or new colleagues, sometimes still present difficulties.

==== Hungarian ====
[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] provides numerous, often subtle means of T–V distinction:

The use of the second-person conjugation with the pronoun {{lang|hu|te}} (plural {{lang|hu|ti}}) is the most informal mode. As in many other European languages, it is used within families, among children, lovers, close friends, (nowadays often) among coworkers, and in some communities, suggesting an idea of brotherhood. Adults unilaterally address children this way, and it is the form used in addressing God and other Christian figures (such as Jesus Christ or the Blessed Virgin), animals, and objects or ideas. Sociologically, the use of this form is widening. Whereas traditionally the switch to {{lang|hu|te}} is often a symbolic milestone between people, sometimes sealed by drinking a glass of wine together ({{lang|hu|pertu}}), today people under the age of about thirty will often mutually adopt {{lang|hu|te}} automatically in informal situations. A notable example is the Internet: strangers meeting online use the informal forms of address virtually exclusively, regardless of age or status differences. &lt;!-- even [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]] as a Prime Minister in office encouraged&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110721110805/http://kapcsolat.hu/blog/februar_2-a_van._klaranak_a_felesegemnek_ma_van_a_szuletesnapja. Február 2-a van. Klárának, a feleségemnek ma van a születésnapja. (2006.02.02. 18:40)]. "Hadd kezdjem talán azzal, hogy számomra eléggé természetes, hogy tegeződünk, szerintem ennek semmi köze a miniszterelnök tekintélyéhez. Ne feszélyezzen benneteket, mert ha bárki is úgy érzi, akkor előbb-utóbb engem is feszélyezni fog, hogy én tegeződöm." ("Let me begin with mentioning that it's quite natural for me to use the informal way of addressing; I don't think it has anything to do with the Prime Minister's prestige. Don't let yourselves be embarrassed, because if anyone feels like that then sooner or later I'll also be embarrassed to do so.")&lt;/ref&gt; people in his [[blog]] to use ''te'' mutually when asking him. [[IKEA]] (or rather, its Hungarian team) was noted and practically unique in its choice of this way of addressing people in Hungary in its brochures; reactions were mixed. --&gt;

Nevertheless, formal forms of address are alive and well in Hungarian:
* The third-person verb conjugation is the primary basis of formal address. The choice of which ''pronoun'' to use, however, is fraught with difficulty (and indeed a common solution when in doubt is to simply avoid using any pronoun at all, using the addressee's name or title instead). &lt;!-- this is not restricted to the nominative. Consider things you might say to someone who just arrived in your city: ''Isten hozta'' [önt]; ''Milyen volt az útja?'' [önnek]; ''Remélem, tetszik a városunk'' [önnek]; (a taxiban) ''Hova vihetem?'' [önt]; etc.etc.etc. … --&gt;
** The pronoun {{lang|hu|maga}} (plural {{lang|hu|maguk}}), for instance, is considered the basic formal equivalent of "you", but may not be used indiscriminately, as it tends to imply an existing or desired personal acquaintance. (It would not, for instance, ordinarily be used in a conversation where the relative social roles are predominantly important – say, between professor and student.) Typical situations where {{lang|hu|maga}} might be used are, e.g., distant relatives, neighbours, fellow travellers on the train, or at the hairdresser's. If one already knows these people, they may even take offence if one were to address them more formally. On the other hand, some urbanites tend to avoid {{lang|hu|maga}}, finding it too rural, old-fashioned, offensive or even intimate. – Note that {{lang|hu|maga}} coincides with the [[reflexive pronoun]] (cf. him/herself), so e.g. the sentence {{lang|hu|Megütötte magát?}} can have three meanings: "Did he hit himself?", "Did he hit you?" or "Did you hit yourself?".
** {{lang|hu|Ön}} (plural {{lang|hu|önök}}) is the formal, official and impersonal "you". It is the form used when people take part in a situation merely as representatives of [[role|social roles]], where personal acquaintance is not a factor. It is thus used in institutions, business, bureaucracy, advertisements, by broadcasters, by shopkeepers to their customers, and whenever one wishes to maintain one's distance. It is less typical of rural areas or small towns, more typical of cities. It's often capitalized in letters.
** Other pronouns are nowadays rare, restricted to rural, jocular, dialect, or old-fashioned speech. Such are, for instance, {{lang|hu|kend}} and {{lang|hu|kegyed}}.
** There is a wide spectrum of third-person address that avoids the above pronouns entirely; preferring to substitute various combinations of the addressee's names and/or titles. Thus, for instance, a university student might ask {{lang|hu|mit gondol X. tanár úr?}} ("What does Professor X. think?", meant for the addressee) rather than using the insufficiently formal {{lang|hu|maga}} or the overly impersonal {{lang|hu|ön}}. If the difference in rank is not to be emphasized, it is perfectly acceptable to use the addressed person's first name instead of a second-person pronoun, e.g. {{lang|hu|Megkérném arra Pétert, hogy...}} ("I'd like to ask [you,] Peter to…"). (Note that these are possible because the formal second-person conjugation of verbs is the same as the third-person conjugation.)
* Finally, the [[auxiliary verb]] {{lang|hu|tetszik}} (lit. "it pleases [you]") is an indirect alternative (or, perhaps, supplement) to direct address with the third or even second person. In terms of grammar, it can only be applied if the addressed person is mentioned in the [[nominative]], otherwise it is replaced by forms with the name or {{lang|hu|maga}}. It is very polite (sometimes seen as over-polite) and not as formal as the {{lang|hu|Ön}} form. Children usually address adults outside their family this way. Adults may address more distant relatives, [[housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeepers]] and older persons using this form, and some men habitually address older or younger women this way (this is slightly old-fashioned).
&lt;!-- Please make it possible for the reader to comprehend the content and its key points by not making it longer than it already is --&gt;

It is important to keep in mind that formal conjugation doesn't automatically imply politeness or vice versa; these factors are independent of each other. For example, {{lang|hu|Mit parancsolsz?}} "What would you like to have?" (literally, "What do you command?") is in the informal conjugation, while it can be extremely polite, making it possible to express one's honour towards people one has previously established a friendly relationship with. On the other hand, {{lang|hu|Mit akar?}} "What do you want?" is expressed with the formal conjugation, nevertheless it may sound rude and aggressive; the formal conjugation does not soften this tone in any way.

=== Turkic ===
==== Turkish ====
In modern [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the T–V distinction is strong. Family members and friends speak to one another using the second-person singular {{lang|tr|sen}}, and adults use {{lang|tr|sen}} to address minors. In formal situations (business, customer–clerk, and colleague relationships, or meeting people for the first time) the plural second-person {{lang|tr|siz}} is used almost exclusively. In very formal situations, the double plural second-person {{lang|tr|sizler}} may be used to address a much-respected person. Rarely, the third-person plural form of the verb (but not the pronoun) may be used to emphasize utmost respect. Additionally, if there are two or more person {{lang|tr|siz}} or {{lang|tr|sizler}} could be used. For example, {{lang|tr|Siz seçildiniz}} or {{lang|tr|Sizler seçildiniz}} have same meaning that "You have been chosen". However, {{lang|tr|Siz seçildiniz}} are not certain whether plural or singular. It changes; formal speaking {{lang|tr|siz}} specifies one person or more but informal speaking it specifies only two or more person. In the imperative, there are four forms: second person singular for informal, second person plural for formal, and second person double plural for very formal situations: {{lang|tr|gel}} (second person singular, informal), {{lang|tr|gelin}} (second person plural, formal), and {{lang|tr|geliniz}} (double second person plural, very formal). The very formal forms are not frequently used in spoken Turkish, but is pretty common in written directives, such as manuals and warning signs.

==== Uyghur ====
[[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] is notable for using four different forms, to distinguish both singular and plural in both formal and informal registers. The informal plural {{lang|ug-Latn|silär}} originated as a contraction of {{lang|ug-Latn|sizlär}}, which uses a regular plural ending. In [[Old Turkic]], as still in modern Turkish, {{lang|otk|𐰾𐰃𐰕}} ({{lang|otk-Latn|siz}}) was the original second-person plural. However, in modern Uyghur {{lang|ug|سئز}} ({{lang|ug-Latn|siz}}) has become restricted to the formal singular, requiring the plural suffix {{lang|ug-Latn|-lär}} for the plurals.

{{lang|ug-Latn|Siz}} as the formal singular pronoun is characteristic of the [[Ürümqi]] dialect, which is the Uyghur literary standard. In [[Turpan]] they say {{lang|ug|سئلئ}} ({{lang|ug-Latn|sili}}) and in [[Kashgar]] dialect, {{lang|ug-Latn|özlär}}. {{lang|ug-Latn|Sili}} is also used in other areas sometimes, while in literary Uyghur {{lang|ug-Latn|özlär}} as a singular pronoun is considered a "hyperdeferential" level of respect; the deferential plural form is {{lang|ug-Latn|härqaysiliri}}.

=== Northwest Caucasian ===

==== Ubykh ====
In the extinct [[Ubykh language]], the T–V distinction was most notable between a man and his mother-in-law, where the plural form {{lang|uby|sʸæghʷa}} supplanted the singular {{lang|uby|wæghʷa}} very frequently, possibly under the influence of [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. The distinction was upheld less frequently in other relationships, but did still occur.

=== Semitic ===

==== Arabic ====
[[Modern Standard Arabic]] uses the [[majestic plural]] form of the [[grammatical person|second person]] ({{lang|ar|أنتم}} {{lang|ar-Latn|antum}}) in respectful address.{{cn|date=February 2017}} It is restricted to highly formal contexts, generally relating to politics and government. However, several [[varieties of Arabic]] have a clearer T–V distinction. The most developed is in [[Egyptian Arabic]], which uses {{lang|arz|حضرتك}} {{lang|arz-Latn|ḥaḍritak}} (literally, "Your [[Grace (style)|Grace]]"), {{lang|arz|سعادتك}} {{lang|arz-Latn|sa‘adtak}} and {{lang|arz|سيادتك}} {{lang|arz-Latn|siyadtak}} (literally, "Your Lordship") as the "V" terms, depending on context, while {{lang|arz|أنت}} {{lang|arz-Latn|inta}} is the "T" term. {{lang|arz-Latn|Ḥaḍritak}} is the most usual "V" term, with {{lang|arz-Latn|sa‘adtak}} and {{lang|arz-Latn|siyadtak}} being reserved for situations where the addressee is of very high social standing (e.g. a high-ranking government official or a powerful businessman). Finally, the "V" term is used only with social superiors (including elders); unfamiliar people perceived to be of similar or lower social standing to the speaker are addressed with the ''T'' term {{lang|arz-Latn|inta}}.

==== Hebrew ====
In modern [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], there is a T–V distinction used in a set of very formal occasions, for example, a lawyer addressing a judge, or when speaking to rabbis. The second person singular {{lang|he|אַתָּה}} ({{lang|he-Latn|ʔaˈta}}, masculine) or {{lang|he|אַתְּ}} ({{lang|he-Latn|ʔat}}, feminine) are the usual form of address in all other situations, e.g. when addressing ministers or members of the [[Knesset]].

The formal form of address when speaking to a person of higher authority is the third person singular using the person's title without the use of the pronoun. Thus, a rabbi could be asked: {{lang|he|?כְּבוֹד הָרַב יִרְצֶה לֶאֱכֹל}} ({{lang|he-Latn|kəˈvod haˈʁav yiʁˈtse leʔeˈχol'}}, "would the honorable rabbi like to eat?") or a judge told: {{lang|he|כְּבוֹדוֹ דָּן בְּבַקָּשָׁתִי}} ({{lang|he-Latn|kəvoˈdo dan bəvakaʃaˈti}}, "his honour is considering my request").

Other persons of authority are normally addressed by their title only, rather than by name, using the second person singular. For example, officers and commanders in the army are addressed as {{lang|he|הַמְּפַקֵּד}} ({{lang|he-Latn|haməfaˈked}}, "the commander") by troops.

In non-Hebrew-speaking Jewish culture, the second-person form of address is similarly avoided in cases of higher authority (e.g., a student in a [[yeshiva]] would be far more likely to say in a classroom discussion "yesterday the Rav told us..." than "yesterday you told us..."). However, this usage is limited to more conservative (i.e. Orthodox) circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|he|אורי אורבך, סבא שלי היה רב, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dravidian===

==== Tamil ====
In [[Tamil language|Tamil]], the second-person singular pronoun நீ {{IPA|[niː]}} and its derived forms are used to address children, (younger or very close) members of the family and to people who are younger than the speaker. The second person plural pronoun நீங்கள் {{IPA|[niːŋgʌɭ]}} is used to address elders (also within the extended family), teachers, people who are older than the speaker and anyone whom the speaker does not personally know, especially in formal situations.

=== Sino-Tibetan ===

==== Chinese ====
{{anchor|Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin|Shanghainese|Cantonese|Minnan}}
{{See also|Chinese honorifics|Chinese naming taboo}}
[[Chinese culture]] has taken [[Chinese names|naming]] and [[Chinese honorifics|forms of address]] very seriously, strictly regulating which people were permitted to use which terms in conversation or in writing. The extreme example is the 1777 execution of [[Wang Xihou]] and [[nine exterminations|his entire family]] and the confiscation of their entire estate as his penalty for writing the [[Qianlong Emperor]]'s personal name as part of a criticism of the [[Kangxi Dictionary]]. Many honorifics and niceties of address fell by the wayside during the [[Cultural Revolution]] of the late 1960s amid [[Mao Zedong]]'s campaign against the "[[Four Olds]]". This included an attempt to eradicate expressions of deference to teachers and to others seen as preserving "counter-revolutionary" modes of thought. The defeat of the Maoist [[Gang of Four]] in the late 1970s and continuing [[Chinese economic reform|reforms]] since the 1980s has, however, permitted a return of such traditional and regional expressions.

Historically, the T–V distinction was observed among the Chinese by avoiding ''any'' use of common pronouns in addressing a respected audience. Instead, third-person [[Chinese honorifics#Addressing or referring to others|honorifics]] and respectful titles were employed. One aspect of such respectful address was avoiding the use of the ''first''-person pronoun as well, instead choosing a (typically humble) [[Chinese honorifics#Referring to oneself|epithet]] in its place. The extreme of this practice occurred when [[Shi Huangdi]] abrogated the then-current first-person pronoun {{lang|zh|朕}} (''zhèn''); the present first-person pronoun {{lang|zh|我}} (''wǒ'') subsequently developed out of the habit of referring to "this [worthless] body", the character's original meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Zdic.net. {{lang|zh|《漢典》}} [''Chinese Dictionary'']. "[http://www.zdic.net/z/1a/js/6211.htm　{{lang|zh|我}}]". Accessed 21 August 2013. {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important difference between the T–V distinction in Chinese compared with modern European languages is that Chinese culture considers the relative age of the speakers an important aspect of their [[social distance]]. This is especially strong within families: while the speakers of European languages may generally prefer forms of address such as "father" or "grandpa", Chinese speakers consider using the personal names of elders such a [[Chinese naming taboo|taboo]] that they may not even ''know'' the given names of grandparents who live in the same apartment. While strictures against writing the personal name of any ancestor of the last seven generations are no longer observed, it remains very uncommon to [[Chinese names|name children]] for any living relative: younger people using the name freely would disrespect the original bearer.

In the present day, the informal second-person pronoun is {{lang|zh|{{linktext|你}}}} ([[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]: ''nǐ''; [[Minnan language|Minnan]]: ''lí'') and the honorific pronoun is {{lang|zh|{{linktext|您}}}} (Mandarin: ''nín''; Minnan: ''lín''). Much like European languages, the honorific form developed out of an earlier second-person plural: during the [[Jurchen Dynasty|Jin]] and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] [[list of Chinese dynasties|dynasties]], the Mandarin dialects mutated {{lang|zh|{{linktext|你每}}}} (''nǐměi'') into {{lang|zh|{{linktext|你們}}}} (''nǐmen'') and then into {{lang|zh|您}}.&lt;ref&gt;Although modern Chinese now distinguishes between {{lang|zh|你们}} ("you" [plural]) and {{lang|zh|您}} ("you" [cherished, respectful]), the legacy of {{lang|zh|您}}'s origin is still retained in the rarity of observing the form {{lang|zh|{{linktext|您们}}}} in Mandarin Chinese. Native speakers employ indirect phrasing like "everybody"　({{lang|zh|{{linktext|大家}}}}, ''dàjiā'', lit. "big family") or "ladies and gentlemen" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|各位}}}}, ''gèwèi'', lit. "every seat") and {{lang|zh|您们}} only infrequently appears in [[Taiwanese Mandarin]] and among foreign students of the language.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A similar form {{ndash}} {{lang|zh|{{linktext|怹}}}}, ''tān'' {{ndash}} developed for the third-person singular but is now generally unused.) It is worth noting that the T–V distinction in Mandarin does ''not'' connote a distance or lack of intimacy between the speakers (as implied, e.g., in the French ''vous''). On the contrary, it is often noted that the respectful form contains the [[Chinese radical|radical]] for "heart" ({{lang|zh|心}}, ''xīn''); although this is actually for [[Chinese character#Rebus|phonetic reasons]], the implication is that the addressee is loved and cherished by the speaker.

Most [[Northern and southern China|southern dialects]], however, do not make this distinction in speech at all. [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] and [[Shanghainese language|Shanghainese]] speakers learn to ''[[written Chinese|write]]'' both forms in school but pronounce them identically: the Cantonese as ''nei''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; and the Shanghainese as ''nóng''. Formality is still respected, but their languages {{ndash}} like [[#Japanese|Japanese]] and [[#Vietnamese|Vietnamese]] {{ndash}} retain the earlier Chinese tradition of employing epithets or honorifics instead of using any pronouns at all when showing formal respect.

=== Japonic ===

==== Japanese ====
{{Main|Japanese pronouns}}
{{See also|Japanese honorifics|Honorific speech in Japanese}}
Under heavy [[#Chinese|Chinese]] influence, traditional [[Japanese culture]] eschewed the use of common pronouns in formal speech; similarly, the Chinese first-person singular {{lang|ja|朕}} ({{lang|ja|ちん}}, ''chin'') was arrogated to the personal use of the [[emperor of Japan|emperor]]. The formality of Japanese culture was such that its [[Japanese pronouns#Archaic personal pronouns|original pronouns]] have largely ceased to be used at all. Some linguists therefore argue that [[Japanese language|Japanese]] lacks ''any'' pronouns whatsoever, but {{ndash}} although it is a larger and more complex group of words than most languages employ {{ndash}} [[Japanese pronouns]] do exist, having developed out of the most common epithets used to express different relationships and relative degrees of social status. As in [[#Korean|Korean]], polite language encompasses not only these specific pronouns but also suffixes and vocabulary as well.

Most commonly, {{lang|ja|{{linktext|君}}}} ({{lang|ja|きみ}}, ''kimi'', &lt;small&gt;orig.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"prince", "lord") is used informally as the second-person singular and {{lang|ja|{{linktext|貴方}}}} ({{lang|ja|あなた}}, ''anata'', &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "dear one") is the most common polite equivalent, but is also commonly used by women towards an intimate as a term of endearment.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The pronoun {{lang|ja|{{linktext|貴様}}}} ({{lang|ja|きさま}}, ''kisama'') is illustrative of the complexity that can be involved, though, in that its literal meaning is quite flattering {{ndash}} &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "dear and honorable sir" {{ndash}} but its ironic use has made it a strong insult in modern Japanese. Similarly, {{lang|ja|{{linktext|御前}}}} ({{lang|ja|おまえ}}, ''omae'') {{ndash}} &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "(one who is) before (me)" {{ndash}} was traditionally a respectful pronoun used toward aristocrats and religious figureheads, but today is considered very informal and impolite, yet also commonly used by husbands towards their wives in an endearing manner.

==== Vietnamese ====
{{Main|Vietnamese pronouns}}
Under heavy [[#Chinese|Chinese]] influence, [[Vietnamese culture]] has eschewed the use of [[Vietnamese pronouns#true pronouns|common pronouns]] in formal speech; similarly, the Chinese first-person singular {{lang|zh|朕}} (Vietnamese:&amp;nbsp;''trẫm'') was arrogated to the personal use of the [[emperor of Vietnam|emperor]].

In modern Vietnamese, only the first-person singular ''tôi'' is in common use as a respectful pronoun; any other pronoun should be replaced with the subject's name or with an appropriate epithet, title, or relationship in polite formal speech. Similar to modern Chinese (but to a much greater extent), modern Vietnamese also frequently replaces ''informal'' pronouns with [[Vietnamese pronouns#Kinship terms|kinship terms]] in many situations. The somewhat insulting second-person singular ''mày'' is also frequently used in informal situations among young Vietnamese.

=== Tai–Kadai languages ===

==== Thai ====
In [[Thai language|Thai]], first, second, and third person pronouns vary in formality according to the social standing of the speaker and the referent and the relationship between them. For a non-exhaustive list of Thai second person pronouns, see http://www.into-asia.com/thai_language/grammar/you.php.

=== Austronesian ===

==== Indonesian ====
In [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], the T–V distinction is extremely important; addressing a stranger with the pronoun ''kau'' or ''kamu'' (you) is considered rude and impolite (unless the stranger is, for example, a child). When addressing a stranger or someone older, typically ''Bu'' ('ma'am') or ''Pak'' ('sir') is used. People also use ''mas'' (Javanese for 'older brother') or ''mbak'' (Javanese for 'older sister') when addressing someone that is not old enough to be called ''Bu'' or ''Pak''. There are variations in different areas. If the situation is more formal, such as in meetings or news broadcasting, ''Anda'' is always used, even if those addressed would otherwise be addressed by ''kau'' or ''kamu'' in informal situations. A more informal pronoun, written ''lu'', ''lo'', or sometimes as ''loe'' (originated from Hokkien language) is considered very impolite. This is normally used by teenagers (particularly in urban centers) to their peers. Adults can sometimes be heard using this pronoun with their close friends or when they are angry.

# ''Lu siap?'' ('Are you ready?'): This form is used between friends in very informal situations without the presence of someone who has higher status.
# ''Kamu siap?'' ('Are you ready?'): This form is used between friends in either informal or formal situations without the presence of someone who has higher status.
# ''Anda siap?'' ('Are you ready?'): This form is used between friends in formal situations, between business partners, or with someone who has higher status.
# ''Apakah Anda siap?'' (Are you ready?): This form is used between friends in very formal situations, among strangers, or toward someone who has higher status. Note that ''Apakah'' is an optional question word that is used in close-ended questions (similar to the use of 'to be' and other auxiliary verbs to form close-ended questions in English). This is a form of ''Bahasa Baku''.

Similarly, ''kalian'' dan ''Anda''/''Anda sekalian'' are used.

==== Tagalog ====
In [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], the familiar second person is ''ikáw/ka'' (in the nominative case). This is replaced by ''kayó'' (which is actually the second person plural) when the situation calls for a more polite tone. The pronoun ''kayó'' is accompanied by the particle ''pô''. This form is generally used to show respect to close, older relatives. This is also the form expected when talking with the peers of parents or grandparents.

Traditionally, when a higher degree of formality is required, the third person plural (''silá'') is used instead. It is used when addressing people of higher social rank, such as government officials and senior clergymen. It may also be used when speaking to complete strangers as a matter of courtesy, such as when answering the door or an unknown caller.

# Sino ka? (Who are you?) [Used to ask for the identity of a peer or one of equal social rank, such as a student to a fellow student. Depending on intonation, this question may sound impolite.]
# Sino pô kayó? (Who are you?) [This form implies that the speaker believes the person addressed is a relative or an individual of a higher rank, and is thus used to confirm the relationship.]
# Sino pô silá? (Who are you, Sir/Ma'am?) [Though ''''pô'''' does not really translate as ''''Sir'''' or ''''Ma'am'''', this form implies that the person being addressed is a complete stranger and the speaker has no idea who they are.]

Younger Filipinos tend to mix these forms of address, resulting in questions such as ''Sino ka pô ba?'' in an attempt to sound polite towards a total stranger. This and other nonstandard variants are very widespread, especially in the [[Metro Manila|Manila]] dialect of Tagalog and its [[Greater Manila Area|surrounding suburbs]].

=== Other languages ===

==== Basque ====
{{See also|Basque grammar#Personal pronouns|l1=Basque grammar: Personal pronouns}}
[[Basque language|Basque]] has two levels of formality in every dialect, which are '''hi''' and '''zu'''; Nevertheless, in some areas of Gipuzkoa and Biscay, the respectful form '''berori''' is still used by some speakers, just as the familiar '''xu''' in some areas of the Eastern Low Navarrese dialect, when addressing children and close friends. Most speakers only use the ''zu'' form (''zuka'' level) and that is the usual one used in methods, slogans... although the ''hi'' form (''hika'') is very common in villages.

The neutral or formal one is ''zu'', which originally used to be the plural form of the second person. The informal one is ''hi'', whose use is limited to some specific situations: among close friends, to children (children never use it when addressing their parents, neither the spouses among them), when talking to a younger person, to animals (cattle, pets...), in monologues, and when speaking angrily to somebody. Their common plural form is ''zuek'', whenever the speaker is talking to a group of listeners who would all be individually addressed with the form ''zu'', or the form ''hi'', or both (a conversation where some listeners are addressed as ''zu'' —i.e., somebody's parents, for instance— and others as ''hi'' —the speaker's siblings—).

Unlike ''zu'', ''hi'' sometimes makes a distinction whether the addressed one is a male or a female. For example: ''duk'' (thou, male, hast) and ''dun'' (thou, female, hast). The use of the '''hika''' level requires the allocutive agreement (''hitano'' or ''zeharkako hika'', i.e., indirect ''hika'') in non-subordinate sentences to mark this distinction for the first and third person verbs. Those allocutive forms are found in the Indicative and Conditional moods, but never in the Subjunctive and Imperative moods, with the one exception of ''goazemak'' (let's go, said to a male) and ''goazeman'' (said to a female) in Western dialects, opposed to ''goazen'', the neutral form. For example:

* ''du'' (neutral, s/he has, neutral form), ''dik'' (s/he has, male thou) and ''din'' (s/he has, female thou), as in ''aitak ikasi du'' (polite: Dad has learned it), ''aitak ikasi dik'' (informal, said to a male), and ''aitak ikasi din'' (informal, said to a female).
* ''dio'' (neutral, s/he has it for him / her), ''ziok'' (familiar, s/he has it for him / her, said to a male), and ''zion'' (familiar, s/he has it for him / her, said to a female), as in ''aitak erosi dio'' (polite: Dad has bought it for him / her), ''aitak erosi ziok'' (informal, said to a male), and ''aitak erosi zion'' (informal, said to a female).
* ''nintzen'' (neutral, I was), ''ninduan'' (familiar, said to a male), and ''nindunan'' (familiar, said to a female), as in ''hona etorri nintzen'' (polite: I came here), ''hona etorri ninduan'' (informal, said to a male), and ''hona etorri nindunan'' (informal, said to a female).

Nevertheless, if any of the allocutive sentences becomes subordinate, the formal one is used: ''aitak ikasi duelako'' (because Dad has learned it), ''aitak erosi diolako'' (because Dad bought it for him / her), and ''hona etorri nintzenean'' (when I came here).

On the other hand, in past tense verbal forms, no distinction is made when the addressee is the subject or the direct object in the sentence. For example:

* ''hintzen'', in ''etxera joan hintzen'' (thou wentst home),
* ''huen'', in ''filma ikusi huen'' (thou sawst the film),
* ''hindugun'', in ''ikusi hindugun'' (we saw thee).

But if the familiar second-person appears in the verb, or if the verb is an allocutive form in a non-dependent clause, the masculine and feminine forms differ. For example:

* ''genian / geninan'' (we had something for thee, male / female): ''hiri eman genian, Piarres'' (we gave it to thee, Peter), and ''hiri eman geninan, Maddi'' (we gave it to thee, Mary).
* ''geniean / genienan'' (male allocutive / female allocutive, we had something for them): ''haiei eman geniean, Piarres'' (we gave it to them, Peter), and ''haiei eman genienan, Maddi'' (we gave it to them, Mary). Their corresponding neutral form is ''haiei eman genien''.
* ''banekian erantzuna'' (I knew the answer, said to a male), and ''banekinan erantzuna'' (I knew the answer, said to a female). Their corresponding neutral form is ''banekien erantzuna''.

The friendly ''xu'' form or '''xuketa''' resembles the ''zuka'' forms of the verbs, and includes another kind of allocutive, as ''hika'': cf. ''egia erran dut'' (formal: I told the truth), ''egia erran diat'' (informal, said to a male), ''egia erran dinat'' (informal, said to a female), ''egia erran dautzut'' (in formal Eastern Low Navarrese, I told ''you'' the truth) and ''egia erran dixut'' (''xuketa''). It is mainly used among relatives and close friends.

The ''berori'' form or '''berorika''' is very formal, and hardly used nowadays, mainly in some areas of Biscay and Gipuzkoa, to address priests, the elderly, judges and the nobility. Verbs are inflected in their singular third form, like in Italian (''(Lei) è molto gentile'', opposed to ''(tu) sei molto gentile'', you are very nice / thou art very nice) or the Spanish ''(usted) es muy amable'', opposed to ''(tú) eres muy amable'':

* neutral: ''zuk badakizu hori'' (you know it, formal), and ''zu, eser zaitez hemen'' (you, sit here),
* familiar: ''hik badakik hori'' (thou knowest that, said to a male), ''hik badakin hori'' (to a female), and ''hi, eser hadi hemen'' (sit here, for both genres),
* very formal: ''berorrek badaki hori'' (you know that: cf. ''hark badaki hori'', s/he knows that, neutral), and ''berori, eser bedi hemen'' (you, sit down here: cf ''hura, eser bedi hemen'', let him sit down here).

Unlike the ''hika'' level, ''berorika'' has no allocutive forms.

The extinct dialect of Erronkari or Roncal, spoken in the easternmost area of Navarre, presented a four-levelled system:

* neutral or ''zuketza'', the local equivalent of ''zuka'': ''etxeara xuan zra'' (you went home, you have gone home), ''etxeara xuan naz'' (I went home, I have gone home),
* informal or ''yiketza'', which corresponds to ''hika'': ''etxeara xuan yaz'', (thou wentst home, thou hast gone home), ''etxeara xuan nuk'' / ''etxeara xuan nun'' (I went home, I have been home, said to a male / to a female),
* familiar or ''tzuketza'', like the Eastern Navarrese ''xuka'': ''etxeara xuan nuzu'' (I went home, I have been home),
* and ''orika'', ''duka'' or ''duketza'', the local form of ''berorika'': ''ori etxeara xin da'' (you went home, you have been home).

=== Constructed languages ===

==== Esperanto ====
[[Esperanto]] is a T–V-distinguishing language, but usually ''vi'' is used for both singular and plural, just like ''you'' in modern English. An informal second person singular pronoun, ''ci'', indeed exists, but it is rarely used in practice. It is mainly intended to make the familiar/respectful distinction when translating (literature, for example) from languages that do have the T–V distinction.

Some have imagined ''ci'' as an archaic term that was used before and then fell out of common usage; however, this is not true. It has appeared only sometimes in experimental language. In standard Esperanto, ''vi'' has always been used since the beginning. For example, ''ci'' appears in neither the ''[[Fundamento de Esperanto|Fundamenta Gramatiko]]'' nor the ''[[Unua Libro]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dua persono |publisher= Bertilo |url=http://bertilow.com/pmeg/gramatiko/pronomoj/dua.html |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, especially in some circles, people have begun to use ''ci'' in practical language, mainly as the familiar and intimate singular, reserving ''vi'' for the plural and formal singular. Others use ''ci'' as singular and ''vi'' as plural regardless of formality.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

==== Ido ====
In [[Ido (language)|Ido]], in theory ''tu'' is limited to friends and family, whereas ''vu'' is used anywhere else. However, many users actually adapt the practice in their own mother tongue and use ''tu'' and ''vu'' accordingly. In the plural, though, the only form in use is ''vi'', which does not distinguish between formal and informal address.

In all cases, an -n is added to the original pronoun to indicate a direct object that precedes its own verb: ''Me amoras tu'' (I love you) becomes ''Tun me amoras'' if the direct object takes the first place, for example for emphatic purposes.

==== Tolkien's High Elvish ====
In [[Quenya|High Elvish]], self-named '''Quenya''', there is a distinction between singular informal ''tyë'' and singular formal ''lyë''. The plural of both forms is ''lë''. The formal form is expected between all but family members and close friends. The appendices to ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' state that [[Westron]] followed a similar pattern, although the dialect of Shire had largely lost the formal form.

== Related verbs, nouns and pronouns ==
Some languages have a verb to describe the fact of using either a ''T'' or a ''V'' form. Some also have a related noun or pronoun. The English words are used to refer only to English usage in the past, not to usage in other languages. The analogous distinction may be expressed as "to use first names" or "to be on familiar terms (with someone)".

These emotional reactions become distinguished over time, causing the good things (like the "good old times") to be remembered better than they were, and the bad things recalled even worse than they might have been.

In 1789, [[Revolutionary France]] adopted the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] and, although short-lived, the [[National Convention]] was elected by all men in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mars.wnec.edu/~grempel/courses/wc2/lectures/rev892.html |title=The French Revolution II |publisher=Mars.wnec.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827213104/http://mars.wnec.edu/~grempel/courses/wc2/lectures/rev892.html |archivedate=2008-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revoked by the [[French Directory|Directory]] in 1795.

In the [[United States]], the rise of [[Jacksonian democracy]] from the 1820s to 1850s led to a close approximation of universal manhood suffrage among whites being adopted in all states by 1856.&lt;ref name=NBER2005&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Stanley L.

Most African-American males remained excluded; though the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified in 1870, upheld their voting rights, they were denied the right to vote in many places for another century until the [[Civil Rights Movement]] gained passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] through [[United States Congress|Congress]].

As women also began to win the right to vote during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the goal of universal manhood suffrage was replaced by [[universal suffrage]].

An '''urban guerrilla'''  is someone who fights a [[government]] using [[unconventional warfare]] or [[domestic terrorism]] in an [[urban area|urban]] environment.

== Theory and history ==
The urban guerrilla phenomenon is essentially one of [[industrialisation|industrialised society]], resting both on the presence of large [[urban agglomeration]]s where hideouts are easy to find and on a theory of [[Social alienation|alienation]] proper to the modern society of [[mass consumption]].

[[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], a commander of the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) is often considered to be the father of modern urban guerrilla warfare.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}  In April 1919 an elite assassination unit, known as [[The Squad (Irish Republican Army unit)|The Squad]] or ''Twelve Apostles'' was created in [[Dublin]].  The unit was tasked with hunting down and executing British Intelligence operatives in the city, they can be considered one of the first true urban guerrilla units.

Historically guerrilla warfare was a rural phenomenon, it was not until the 1960s that the limitations of this form were clearly demonstrated. The technique was almost entirely ineffective when used outside of the later colonial environment, as was shown by the Cuban sponsored efforts in Latin America during the 1960s culminating in the ''[[foco]]'' campaign headed by [[Che Guevara]] in Bolivia that culminated in his death. The need for the target government to be simultaneously incompetent, iniquitous, and politically isolated was rarely met.

The failure of rural insurgency forced the discontented to find new avenues for action, essentially random terrorism aimed at creating maximum publicity, provoking the targeted regimes into excessive repression and so inciting the general population to join a wider revolutionary struggle. This movement found its mentor in the leader of the ephemeral [[Ação Libertadora Nacional]], [[Carlos Marighela]]. Before his death in 1969 he wrote the ''[[Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla]]'' which, between the polemics, gave clear advice on strategy and was quickly adopted by others around the world.

However, not all urban political violence can be labeled as ''urban guerrilla''.  The [[Black Panther Party]] might not qualify, due to its public nature, although its policy of "self-defense" was interchangeable with a policy of armed struggle in militarily occupied African American communities.  Similarly the Italian [[Autonomia]] movement, and the German [[Autonomen]] engaged in urban political violence, but not as urban guerrillas due to their policies of public, mass and non-deadly violence.

In the 1970s BBC comedy "[[Citizen Smith]]" Wolfie Smith, the leader of the fictional "Tooting Popular Front" described himself as an Urban Guerrilla.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4062">'''Vaginal contractions''' are [[muscle contraction|contraction]]s of the [[pelvic muscles]] surrounding the [[vagina]], especially the [[pubococcygeus muscle]]. Vaginal contractions are generally an involuntary muscular response to [[sexual stimulation]], including [[sexual arousal]], and are commonly most intense during [[sexual stimulation]] and culminating in [[orgasm]]. Though usually an involuntary response, some women can control the muscles of the vagina to perform vaginal contractions at will. Vaginal contractions enhance the sexual experience and pleasure for both parties during sexual intercourse.

In a 1982 study, pelvic contractions of 11 women who manually self-stimulated to orgasm were monitored using an anal probe and a vaginal probe simultaneously. Near the perceived start of orgasm, a series of regular contractions began in 9 of the women, with anal and vaginal contractions synchronizing with each other. Three of the women's orgasms consistently included only a series of regular contractions; for six other women, orgasms consistently continued beyond the regular series with additional irregular contractions. Two women had no regular contractions during reported orgasms. The women showed marked differences in orgasm duration and the number of contractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7181645 |year=1982 |last1=Bohlen |first1=JG | last2=Held |first2=JP | last3=Sanderson |first3=MO | last4=Ahlgren |first4=A | title=The female orgasm: pelvic contractions |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=367–86 |journal= Arch Sex Behav| doi=10.1007/bf01541570}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1994 study confirmed these results, but concluded that some women experience their orgasm regularly without contractions and some report having contractions during orgasm only occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8174183 |year=1994 |last1=Kratochvíl |first1=S |title=Vaginal contractions in female orgasm |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=28–33 |journal=Ceskoslovenska psychiatrie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaginal contractions are caused by both the activity of certain brain regions and the release of the hormone oxytocin. It has been suggested that vaginal contractions during orgasm can increase the chances of pregnancy as they transport sperm up the reproductive tract from the vagina to the oviducts, which decreases the distance it has to travel. Additionally, when the woman is fertile sperm is only transported to the side of the dominant ovary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Why Women Have Orgasms: An Evolutionary Analysis|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-012-9967-x|journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior|date = 2012-06-26|issn = 0004-0002|pages = 1127–1143|volume = 41|issue = 5|doi = 10.1007/s10508-012-9967-x|language = en|first = David A.|last = Puts|first2 = Khytam|last2 = Dawood|first3 = Lisa L. M.|last3 = Welling|pmid=22733154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Involuntary vaginal contractions may arise from non-sexual causes. Involuntary spasm of the muscles around the vagina, usually caused by anxiety, can result in [[vaginismus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000141441.41178.6b |title=Botulinum Toxin in the Treatment of Refractory Vaginismus |year=2004 |last1=Ghazizadeh |first1=Shirin |last2=Nikzad |first2=Masoomeh |journal=Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology |volume=104 |issue=5, Part 1 |pages=922–925}}

Vaginal contractions should not be confused with [[uterine contraction]]s.

A '''vigilance committee''' was a group formed of private citizens to administer law and order where they considered governmental structures to be inadequate. The term is commonly associated with the frontier areas of the [[American Old West|American West]] in the mid-19th century, where groups attacked cattle rustlers and gangs, and people at [[gold mining]] claims.  As non-state organizations no functioning checks existed to protect against excessive force or safeguard due process from the committees.  In the years prior to the Civil War, some committees worked to free slaves and transport them to freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/blackhistorymonth/19990222arthur.asp |title=Arthursville abolitionists ran Underground Railroad through Pittsburgh |deadurl=no |accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the West==

In the [[western United States]], both before and after the Civil War, the primary purpose of these committees was to maintain law and order and administer [[Extrajudicial punishment|summary justice]] where governmental law enforcement was inadequate. In the newly settled areas, vigilance committees provided security, and mediated land disputes. In ranching areas, they ruled on ranch boundaries, registered brands, and protected cattle and horses. In the mining districts,  they protected claims,{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} settled claim disputes, and attempted to protect miners and other residents. In [[California]], some residents formed vigilance committees to take control from officials whom they considered to be corrupt. This took place during the trial of Charles Cora (Husband of [[Belle Cora (Arabella Ryan)|Belle Cora]]) and James Casey in [[San Francisco]] during 1856.&lt;ref&gt;"Eyewitness: San Francisco Committee of Vigilance - 1856." Accessed February 26, 2017. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist6/woolley.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disbandment ==
Vigilance committees were generally abandoned when the conditions favoring their creation ceased to exist. In the west, as governmental jurisdiction increased to the degree that courts could dispense justice, residents abandoned the committees.

== Nature ==
Vigilance committees, by their nature, lacked an outside set of ''[[checks and balances]]'', leaving them open for excesses and abuse.

In the West, the speed of the vigilance committees and lack of safeguards sometimes led to the innocent being hanged or to their just disappearing. A few committees were taken over by fraudulent individuals seeking profit or political office.

== United States Vigilance Committees ==
&lt;!--This list needs work. It needs expanding as well as paring. Not all of the several hundred vigilance committees that existed in the 19th century were of historic significance. Some lasted no more than a few days and others accomplished nothing of note. Some were not peaceful committees concerned with eliminating crime, but had malevolent political or racial motives.--&gt;

In November 1916, the Committee issued a report "on the Moral Condition of Oxford," warning that the town's streets were "crowded with young girls, whose dress [and] behaviour show that they are deliberately laying themselves out to attract men." Their reports included detailed accounts of casual or adulterous sexual liaisons in the town. Births out of wedlock in Oxford decreased from 1914 to 1920, but the Committee attributed the reduction to "forced marriages" and [[abortion]]s.&lt;ref name="Graham2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Malcolm Graham|title=Oxford in the Great War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jv5sBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA122|date=30 November 2014|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=978-1-78346-297-1|pages=122–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Your Neighbor's Son: The Making of a Torturer''''' ({{lang-da|'''Din nabos søn'''}} or {{lang|da|'''Din nabos soen'''}}) is a [[documentary film|documentary]] or [[docudrama]] directed by [[Jørgen Flindt Pedersen]] and [[Erik Stephensen]] in two versions, 1976 and 1981. The film documents the conversion of young  [[Greek Military Police]] (ESA) recruits into [[torture]]rs and touches on the subject of the power of the institution to compel otherwise [[morality|moral]] human beings to torture. The documentary examines the processes and methods of the [[military junta]] that ruled [[Greece]] from [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|1967 to 1974]].

==Plot==
The documentary dramatizes the recruiting and training of a number of young men into the Greek police force during the military junta rule. A number of otherwise decent young men are selected based on a number of traits viewed as exploitable by the recruiters: illiterate, [[anti-communism|anti-communist]], young and male, drawing comparisons to the [[Cambodia]]n torturers at [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum|Tuol Sleng]], many of whom were under 19 years old.&lt;ref name=NYT-review/&gt;

The film also interviews [[Michalis Petrou]], a conscript who served in the Military Police and was trained to become one of the most notorious torturers of the EAT-ESA. Petrou's testimony reveals that the training methods themselves were brutal and often torturous and was viewed as a necessity to ensure the robotic and brutal obedience of the trainees.

During the dramatic recreation of the training camps, the directors draw parallels to modern military [[recruit training]]s and the methods used in the training of soldiers.

==Response==
''[[The New York Times]]'' columnist [[Lawrence Van Gelder]] noted that while the film was technically flawed it was at the same time "memorable and unnerving" in its depiction of both the victims of the torture as well as the ordeals of the torturers themselves, and claimed "it is impossible to regard its torturers or its victims without realizing that the view may be a view into a mirror."&lt;ref name=NYT-review&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Lawrence Van Gelder]]|title= Din nabos soen (1981)|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/157325/Din-nabos-soen/overview|publisher=The NY Times|date=August 29, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;
