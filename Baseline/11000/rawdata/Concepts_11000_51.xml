      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7221">'''Abdul Rahman Al-Lahim''' (alternatively al-Lahem) (born 1971) is a [[Saudi]] human rights lawyer active in defending the civil rights of Saudi citizens.&lt;ref name="Nathaniel Rosenblatt 2008, p. 96"&gt;Nathaniel Rosenblatt, Abdul Rahman al-Lahim, Middle East Quarterly, Spring 2008, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Lahim was born in the deeply conservative [[Al-Qassim Province|Qassim]] region. Until the late 1990s, Al-Lahim, who holds a degree in sharia, was an Arabic teacher as well as an [[Islamist]], active in As-Sahwa al-Islamiyya. He is married and the father of two.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/22/AR2006122201579.html Saudi Lawyer Takes On Religious Court System]&lt;/ref&gt;

He became committed to civil rights while attending "Sharia school" in [[Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University]] in Riyadh.&lt;ref name="Washington Post, Dec. 23, 2006"/&gt; According to analysts of his work, Al-Lahim is effective because "He not only crafts effective legal arguments, but he also understands the conservative forces that hold the gavel."&lt;ref name="Nathaniel Rosenblatt 2008, p. 96"/&gt;

On 6 November 2004, Al-Lahim was arrested by Saudi authorities for defending three reform activists on trial in Saudi Arabia charged with "issuing statements and collecting as many signatures as possible on petitions" calling for reforms in the Kingdom as well as of calling for the adoption of a constitutional monarchy and "using Western terminology" in demanding political reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=54195&amp;d=9&amp;m=11&amp;y=2004 Reformists’ Lawyer Arrested After Letter Sent to Crown Prince by Raid Qusti for Arab News 9 November 2004 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716090651/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=54195&amp;d=9&amp;m=11&amp;y=2004 |date=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All three activists and Al-Lahem were released in early August 2005 at the intervention of King Abdullah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=68237&amp;d=10&amp;m=8&amp;y=2005 Abdullah’s Noble Gesture Thanked 10 August 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716090703/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=68237&amp;d=10&amp;m=8&amp;y=2005 |date=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, he defended a high school teacher, Mohammad Al-Harbi, who had been sentenced to a punishment of 750 public lashes for mocking religion by speaking out against terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=73171&amp;d=14&amp;m=11&amp;y=2005 Teacher Charged With Mocking Religion Sentenced to Jail By Ebtihal Mubarak for Arab News, 14 November 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716090716/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=73171&amp;d=14&amp;m=11&amp;y=2005 |date=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=7&amp;section=0&amp;article=73404&amp;d=19&amp;m=11&amp;y=2005 Extremism Rears Its Ugly Head - Arab News 19 November 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716090749/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=7&amp;section=0&amp;article=73404&amp;d=19&amp;m=11&amp;y=2005 |date=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Harbi later received a royal pardon and all charges were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=74352&amp;d=8&amp;m=12&amp;y=2005 All Charges Against Al-Harbi Dropped, Arab news, 8 December 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716090801/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=74352&amp;d=8&amp;m=12&amp;y=2005 |date=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=77469&amp;d=8&amp;m=2&amp;y=2006 Lack of Clear Guidelines Irks Lawyers, Defendants, Arab News, 8 February 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716090809/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=77469&amp;d=8&amp;m=2&amp;y=2006 |date=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Al-Lahim also defended the rape victim known as the "[[Qatif girl rape case|Qatif girl]]" from a sentence of 200 public lashes and faced disbarment for taking her case.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/01/world/01saudi.html Saudi Rape Case Spurs Calls for Reform, New York Times, 1 December 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; He was suspended from the case as a result of the appeal against the punishment and his licence, granted to Saudi lawyers by the ministry of justice, was revoked. He was charged with criticizing the judiciary and conducting activist campaigns in the media.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/17/saudiarabia.international Rape victim sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in jail]&lt;/ref&gt; Later his license was returned to him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=105880&amp;d=20&amp;m=1&amp;y=2008&amp;pix=kingdom.jpg&amp;category=Kingdom Qatif Girl’s Lawyer Gets His License Back] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716090843/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=105880&amp;d=20&amp;m=1&amp;y=2008&amp;pix=kingdom.jpg&amp;category=Kingdom |date=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights organization Amnesty International criticized the persecution of al-Lahem.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/saudi-arabia-lawyer-must-not-be-punished-defending-gang-rape-victim-2007 Saudi Arabia: Lawyer must not be punished  for defending gang rape victim]&lt;/ref&gt;

A travel ban has been imposed against Al-Lahim since 2004 and protested by human right organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontlinedefenders.org/node/1437 Saudi Arabia: Travel ban on human rights defender Abdul]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Al-Lahim was awarded The American Bar Association’s 2008 International Human Rights Lawyer Award in Vienna, although he was unable to attend due to his travel ban.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=111187&amp;d=24&amp;m=6&amp;y=2008 Rights lawyer’s request to lift travel curbs in abeyance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716090918/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=111187&amp;d=24&amp;m=6&amp;y=2008 |date=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abstract''' and '''concrete''' are classifications that denote whether the [[object (philosophy)|object]] that a term describes has physical [[referent|referents]]. Abstract objects have no physical referents, whereas concrete objects do. They are most commonly used in [[philosophy]] and [[semantics]]. Abstract objects are sometimes called '''''abstracta''''' (sing. '''''abstractum''''') and [[concrete object]]s are sometimes called ''[[wikt:concreta|concreta]]'' (sing. ''concretum''). An  abstract object is an [[object (philosophy)|object]] that does not exist at any particular time or place, but rather exists as a [[Type (metaphysics)|type]] of thing—i.e., an [[idea]], or [[abstraction]].&lt;ref name="A Glossary of Literary Terms"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Glossary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SUEtEa9nUWQC&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 September 2012|isbn=0495898023|author1=Abrams|first1=Meyer Howard|last2=Harpham|first2=Geoffrey Galt|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''abstract object'' is said to have been coined by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=D. M.|title=Sketch for a systematic metaphysics|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199655915|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of abstract objects is called [[abstract object theory]].

==In philosophy&lt;!--'Third Realm (Frege)' redirects here--&gt;==
The [[type–token distinction]] identifies physical objects that are tokens of a particular type of thing.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Philip (2012) "The Philosophy of Phonology" in ''Philosophy of Linguistics'' (ed. Kemp, Fernando, Asher), Elsevier, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;  The "type" of which it is a part is in itself an abstract object. The abstract-concrete distinction is often introduced and initially understood in terms of paradigmatic examples of objects of each kind:

Abstract objects have often garnered the interest of philosophers because they raise problems for popular theories. In [[ontology]], abstract objects are considered problematic for [[physicalism]] and some forms of [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]]. Historically, the most important ontological dispute about abstract objects has been the [[problem of universals]]. In [[epistemology]], abstract objects are considered problematic for [[empiricism]]. If abstracta lack causal powers or spatial location, how do we know about them? It is hard to say how they can affect our sensory experiences, and yet we seem to agree on a wide range of claims about them. 

Some, such as [[Edward Zalta]] and arguably, [[Plato]] in his [[Theory of Forms]], have held that abstract objects constitute the defining subject matter of [[metaphysics]] or philosophical inquiry more broadly. To the extent that philosophy is independent of empirical research, and to the extent that empirical questions do not inform questions about abstracta, philosophy would seem especially suited to answering these latter questions. 

In modern philosophy, the distinction between abstract and concrete was explored by [[Immanuel Kant]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Critique of Pure Reason|KrV]]'' A51/B75–6. See also: Edward Willatt, ''Kant, Deleuze and Architectonics'', Continuum, 2010 p. 17: "Kant argues that cognition can only come about as a result of the union of the abstract work of the understanding and the concrete input of sensation."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[G. W. F. Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel: ''[[The Science of Logic]]'', Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 609. See also: Richard Dien Winfield, ''Hegel's Science of Logic: A Critical Rethinking in Thirty Lectures'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2012, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottlob Frege]] said that abstract objects, such as numbers, were members of a '''third realm''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Gottlob Frege]], "Der Gedanke. Eine logische Untersuchung," in: ''Beiträge zur Philosophie des deutschen Idealismus'' 1 (1918/19), pp. 58–77; esp. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Popper's three worlds]].&lt;/ref&gt; different from the external world or from internal [[consciousness]].&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosen|first1=Gideon|title=Abstract Objects|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abstract-objects/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=1 January 2017|date=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Abstract objects and causality===
Another popular proposal for drawing the abstract-concrete distinction contends that an object is abstract if it lacks any [[causality|causal]] powers. A causal power has the ability to affect something causally. Thus, the empty set is abstract because it cannot act on other objects. One problem for this view is that it is not clear exactly what it is to have a causal power. For a more detailed exploration of the abstract-concrete distinction, follow the link below to the ''Stanford Encyclopedia'' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=abstract-objects |title=Abstract Objects |last=Rosen |first=Gideon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concrete and abstract thinking==
[[Jean Piaget]] uses the terms "concrete" and "formal" to describe the different types of learning.  Concrete thinking involves facts and descriptions about everyday, tangible objects, while abstract ([[Formal Operational#Formal operational stage|formal operational]]) thinking involves a mental process.

==Quasi-abstract entities==
Recently, there has been some philosophical interest in the development of a third category of objects known as the quasi-abstract. Quasi-abstract objects have drawn particular attention in the area of [[social ontology]] and [[documentality]]. Some argue that the over-adherence to the platonist duality of the concrete and the abstract has led to a large category of social objects having been overlooked or rejected as nonexisting because they exhibit characteristics that the traditional duality between concrete and abstract regards as incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;B. Smith (2008), "Searle and De Soto: The New Ontology of the Social World." In ''The Mystery of Capital and the Construction of Social Reality''. Open Court.&lt;/ref&gt; Specially, the ability to have temporal location, but not spatial location, and have causal agency (if only by acting through representatives).&lt;ref&gt;E. H. Robinson, [http://www.edwardheath.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Social_Agentivity.pdf "A Theory of Social Agentivity and Its Integration into the Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering"], ''[[International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems]]'' '''7'''(4) (2011) pp. 62–86.&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics are exhibited by a number of social objects, including states of the international legal system.&lt;ref&gt;E. H. Robinson (2014), "A Documentary Theory of States and Their Existence as Quasi-Abstract Entities," ''Geopolitics'' '''19''' (3), pp. 1–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antitheism''' (sometimes '''anti-theism''') is the opposition to [[theism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://atheism.about.com/od/atheismatheiststheism/a/AntiTheism.htm |title=Atheism and Anti-Theism: What's the Difference? What is Anti-Theism? |author=Austin Cline |publisher=[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/antitheism |title=antitheism |publisher=[[The Free Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has had a range of applications.  In [[secularism|secular]] contexts, it typically refers to direct opposition to the belief in any [[deity]].

==Opposition to theism==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines ''antitheist'' as "One opposed to belief in the existence of a god". The earliest citation given for this meaning dates from 1833.&lt;ref&gt;The Shorter OED (1970 reprint) page 78&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Antitheism'' has been adopted as a label by those who regard theism as dangerous, destructive, or encouraging of harmful behavior. [[Christopher Hitchens]] offers an example of this approach in ''[[Letters to a Young Contrarian]]'' (2001), in which he writes: "I'm not even an [[Atheism|atheist]] so much as I am an antitheist; I not only maintain that all religions are versions of the same untruth, but I hold that the influence of churches, and the effect of religious belief, is positively harmful."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to the idea of God==

Other definitions of antitheism include that of the French Catholic philosopher [[Jacques Maritain]] (1953) for whom it is "an active struggle against everything that reminds us of God" (p.&amp;nbsp;104), and that of [[Robert Flint]] (1877), Professor of Divinity at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Flint's [[Baird Lecture]] for 1877 was entitled ''Anti-Theistic Theories''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Flint| first=Robert| title=Anti-Theistic Theories: Being the [[Baird Lecture]] for 1877| edition=5| year=1894| location=London| publisher=William Blackwood and Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used it as a very general [[umbrella term]] for all opposition to his own form of theism, which he defined as the "belief that the heavens and the earth and all that they contain owe their existence and continuance to the wisdom and will of a supreme, self-existent, omnipotent, omniscient, righteous, and benevolent Being, who is distinct from, and independent of, what He has created."&lt;ref&gt;Flint, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In dealing with theories which have nothing in common except that they are antagonistic to theism, it is necessary to have a general term to designate them. Anti-theism appears to be the appropriate word. It is, of course, much more comprehensive in meaning than the term atheism. It applies to all systems which are opposed to theism. It includes, therefore, atheism, but short of atheism there are anti-theistic theories. Polytheism is not atheism, for it does not deny that there is a deity; but it is anti-theistic since it denies that there is only one. Pantheism is not atheism, for it asserts that there is a god; but it is anti-theism, for it denies that god is a being distinct from creation and possessed of such attributes as wisdom, and holiness, and love. Every theory which refuses to ascribe to a god an attribute which is essential to a worthy conception of its character is anti-theistic. Only those theories which refuse to acknowledge that there is evidence even for the existence of a god are atheistic.&lt;ref&gt;Flint, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Flint also acknowledges that antitheism is typically understood differently from how he defines it. In particular, he notes that it has been used as a subdivision of atheism, descriptive of the view that theism has been disproven, rather than as the more general term that Flint prefers. He rejects ''[[nontheism|non-theistic]]'' as an alternative, "not merely because of its hybrid origin and character, but also because it is far too comprehensive. Theories of physical and mental science are non-theistic, even when in no degree, directly or indirectly, antagonistic to theism."&lt;ref&gt;Flint, p. 444–445&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to the existence of a god or gods is frequently referred to as [[dystheism]] (which means "belief in a deity that is not benevolent") or [[misotheism]] (strictly speaking, this means "hatred of God"). Examples of belief systems founded on the principle of opposition to the existence of a god or gods include some forms of [[Atheistic Satanism]] and [[maltheism]].

==Other uses==
{{see also|Misotheism#Terminology}}
Another use of the term ''antitheism'' was coined by [[Christopher New]] in a thought experiment published in 1993. In his article, he imagines what arguments for the existence of an evil god would look like: "Antitheists, like theists, would have believed in an omnipotent, omniscient, eternal creator; but whereas theists in fact believe that the supreme being is also perfectly good, antitheists would have believed that he was perfectly evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=New| first=Christopher|date=June 1993| title=Antitheism – A Reflection| journal=Ratio| volume=6| issue=1| pages=36–43| doi=10.1111/j.1467-9329.1993.tb00051.x}}. See also: Daniels, Charles B. (1997). "God, demon, good, evil", ''The Journal of Value Inquiry'', Vol. 31 (2), June, pp.177–181.&lt;/ref&gt; New's usage has reappeared in the work of Wallace A. Murphree.&lt;ref&gt;Murphree, Wallace A. (1997). "[http://www.springerlink.com/content/n458676824862657/ Natural Theology: theism or antitheism]", ''Sophia'', Vol.36 (1), March, pp.75–83&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word "antitheism" (or the hyphenated "anti-theism") has been recorded in English since 1788.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=antitheism|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=antitheism&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[etymology|etymological]] roots of the word are the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[wikt:ἀντί|anti]]'' and ''[[wikt:θεός#Ancient Greek|theos]].''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6212">'''Avalon Organic Gardens &amp; EcoVillage''' also known as Avalon Gardens, is a [[sustainable community]] and [[ecovillage]] started in 1994 by [[Global Community Communications Alliance]]. The ecovillage is located in [[Tumacacori, Arizona]], south of [[Tubac, Arizona]] in the Santa Cruz Valley and consists of over 100 residents. Its sustainable practices include [[recycling]], [[compost]]ing, [[organic gardening]], [[rainwater harvesting]], [[greywater]] recycling, [[alternative energy]] sources, [[eco-architecture]], [[resource management]], and [[Sustainability#Management of human consumption|human consumption management]].

==History and vision==
Avalon Gardens was started in 1994 in northern [[Arizona]], USA. In 2007 the ecovillage moved to the Potreros Ranch in Tumacacori, neighboring the [[Mission San José de Tumacácori]] (Tumacacori Mission), started by Father [[Eusebio Kino]] in 1691. The ecovillage incorporates some of the traditional agricultural practices employed by the Tumacacori ranchers and farmers in former decades as well as newer [[permaculture]] methods. They plan to extend their facilities and housing to accommodate visiting and resident [[WWOOF]]ers, students, and workshop participants.&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Milinovich “New Neighbors”, The Villager June/July 2007, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities and development==

===Organic gardening===
Avalon Gardens has a year-round organic food production system that involves [[greenhouse]]s, [[garden bed]]s and [[forest gardening]], [[drip irrigation]], soil composting and development, [[food preservation]], and [[seed saving]]. Avalon Gardens locally participates in the [[community-supported agriculture]] (CSA) program,&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Vandervoet, “Avalon Organic Gardens, Farm, and Ranch Harvests Organic Produce Locally” Santa Cruz Valley Sun, August 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; being the first established in the state of Arizona. Their “Hands In The Soil” mornings are organized for public participation in [[organic gardening]] at the ecovillage, and workshops and tours are held regularly for public education and training. The gardens also supplies vegetables to the Food For Ascension Café, an organic [[vegan]]-[[vegetarian]] and [[slow food]] movement restaurant in Tucson.

===Water harvesting===
Water harvesting is important to the ecovillage because they are located in desert climate. At the ecovillage, rainwater is collected from house rooftops and water-catchment tanks. Thousands of gallons of run-off rainwater are redirected and stored to water high-water use trees, their [[food forest]], gardens, and [[pasture]]s. Through a greywater system, water is harvested from washing machines, indoor and outdoor showers, and house sinks and basins. This water is used to water flower beds, trees, and plants around the homes.

Rainwater harvesting has become significant in view of the realization that water has become scarce and it is becoming a critical problem globally. In big cities large residencies are required to have a rainwater harvesting system. For the present, drains are being constructed with conventional materials such as brick and [[stonemasonry]] and R.C.C. side drains. Rain water is made to flow through these drains to a centralized water storage tank. Water from this tank is designated for nondomestic and gardening purposes. The water storage tank is of brick masonry or R.C.C. The drains for the flow of rainwater and the tank for the storage of rainwater can be constructed using [[Ferrocement]] technology. Ferrocement drains are machine-made, precast products about 2.4 to 5 meters long with covers and perforations of the same length at about 25&amp;nbsp;mm thick. The surfaces of these drains are known to be strong and not easily eroded by the flow of water. The bottom and sides of the water storage tanks consist of ferrocement plates with space frames. These plates are about 25&amp;nbsp;mm thick, waterproof, strong, durable, and low-maintenance.

===Energy-efficient building===
The ecovillage uses sustainable, renewable, and recycled building materials in their building and construction projects. Paper and cardboard products are reused by blending them into a fiber pulp that is mixed with cement, poured into molds, and dried. This reused paper-cement mix is called [[papercrete]], and the blocks are used as building material for walls, benches, flower beds, and other types of structures. Some of the sustainable dwellings at Avalon Gardens include earth domes, [[monolithic domes]], yurts, and Eco-friendly houses.

===Sustainable transport &amp; sharing resources===
To reduce their [[ecological footprint]], noise and air pollution, ecovillage residents [[carpool]], group-transit, bike, walk, and use other means of [[sustainable transport]]. Assigned shoppers buy food and supplies in bulk, and designated shuttle drivers make daily pickups and deliveries for over 100 residents.

Ecovillage residents share resources like vehicles, washing machines, and household appliances to make the most and best use of them. One of their facilities is a community kitchen and dining room where most of the meals are prepared and served for the entire community. Bio-friendly cleaning products and personal care products are also used to avoid water and environmental contamination.

The '''belief–desire–intention''' ('''BDI''') model of human practical reasoning was developed by [[Michael Bratman]] as a way of explaining future-directed intention.

BDI is fundamentally reliant on [[folk psychology]] (the 'theory theory'), which is the notion that our mental models of the world are theories. It was used as a basis for developing the [[belief–desire–intention software model]].

==Applications==

BDI was part of the inspiration behind the [[Belief–desire–intention software model|BDI software architecture]], which Bratman was also involved in developing. Here, the notion of intention was seen as a way of limiting time spent on deliberating about what to do, by eliminating choices inconsistent with current intentions.

BDI has also aroused some interest in psychology. BDI formed the basis for a computational model of childlike reasoning [https://web.archive.org/web/20070629002644/http://cognition.iig.uni-freiburg.de/csq/pdf-files/Wahl_Spada.pdf CRIBB]. It has been proposed that autistic children do not recognise other people as folk-psychological agents (i.e., agents with their own beliefs, etc.). BDI has been used to develop a [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/7906/21803/01011803.pdf rehabilitation strategy] to teach autistic children to reason about other people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6181">'''"Bulk personal datasets"''' is the UK government's [[euphemism]] for datasets containing [[personally identifiable information]] on a large number of individuals, as part of [[mass surveillance in the United Kingdom]] and on citizens around the world.

The term was first used publicly in March 2015 by the [[Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament]], and is subject to significant controversy.

Other [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]] departments have programmes utilising bulk personal datasets, one of which is the [[care.data]] programme in the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] and [[National Health Service]]. In [[health]], bulk personal datasets are created as a by-product of providing [[direct care]].

== Controversy ==
The judicial body which oversees the intelligence services in the United Kingdom, the [[Investigatory Powers Tribunal]], ruled that the legislative framework in the United Kingdom does not permit mass surveillance and that while GCHQ collects and analyses data in bulk, it does not practice mass surveillance.&lt;ref name="BBC141206"&gt;{{cite news |title=GCHQ does not breach human rights, judges rule |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30345801 |accessdate=6 December 2014 |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=5 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GCHQ20141205"&gt;{{cite web |title=IPT rejects assertions of mass surveillance |url=http://www.gchq.gov.uk/press_and_media/news_and_features/Pages/IPT-rejects-assertions-of-mass-surveillance.aspx |publisher=[[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]] |accessdate=7 February 2015 |date=5 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206232713/http://www.gchq.gov.uk/press_and_media/news_and_features/Pages/IPT-rejects-assertions-of-mass-surveillance.aspx |archivedate=6 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IPTList"&gt;{{cite web |title=List of judgments |url=http://www.ipt-uk.com/section.aspx?pageid=8 |publisher=Investigatory Powers Tribunal |accessdate=7 February 2015 |date=5 December 2014 |quote=Quote: # A declaration that the regime governing the soliciting, receiving, storing and transmitting by UK authorities of private communications of individuals located in the UK which have been obtained by US authorities pursuant to [[PRISM (surveillance program)|Prism]] and/or [[UPSTREAM|Upstream]] does not contravene Articles 8 or 10 [[European Convention on Human Rights|ECHR]]. # A declaration that the regime in respect of interception under ss8(4), 15 and 16 of the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]] does not contravene Articles 8 or 10 ECHR and does not give rise to unlawful discrimination contrary to Article 14, read together with Articles 8 and/or 10 of the ECHR. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206211011/http://www.ipt-uk.com/section.aspx?pageid=8 |archivedate=6 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A special report published by the [[Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament]] also came to this view, although it found past shortcomings in oversight and said the legal framework should be simplified to improve transparency.&lt;ref name="BBC20150314"&gt;{{cite web |title=UK surveillance 'lacks transparency', ISC report says |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31845338 |work=[[BBC News Online]] |accessdate=14 March 2015 |date=12 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISC2015March"&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy and Security: A modern and transparent legal framework |url=http://isc.independent.gov.uk/news-archive/12march2015 |publisher=[[Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament]] |accessdate=14 March 2015 |date=12 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian20150314"&gt;{{cite news |title=Intelligence and security committee report: the key findings |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/12/intelligence-security-committee-report-key-findings |accessdate=14 March 2015 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=12 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Autism]] involves [[Neurodevelopmental disorder|atypical brain development]] which often becomes apparent in behavior and social development before a child is three years old. It can be characterized by impairments in social interaction and communication, as well as restricted interests and stereotyped behavior, and the characterization is independent of any underlying neurological defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |title= Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=4th, text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) |author= American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |chapter= Diagnostic criteria for 299.00 Autistic Disorder |chapterurl=http://cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/overview_diagnostic_criteria.htm#Autistic |accessdate=2009-02-17 |publisher=&lt;!--comment to foil Citation bot--&gt;|location= &lt;!--comment to foil Citation bot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |chapterurl=http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf80.htm+f840 |year=2006 |accessdate=2007-06-25 |title= International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems |edition=10th ([[ICD-10]]) |author= [[World Health Organization]] |chapter= F84.

The consensus among mainstream autism researchers is that genetic factors predominate. Environmental factors that have been claimed to contribute to autism or exacerbate its symptoms, or that may be important to consider in future research, include certain foods,&lt;ref name="Christison" /&gt; [[infectious disease]], [[heavy metals]], [[solvent]]s, [[diesel exhaust]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]], [[phthalates]] and [[phenol]]s used in [[plastic]] products, [[pesticide]]s, [[brominated flame retardant]]s, [[Ethanol|alcohol]], [[smoking]], [[illicit drug]]s, and [[vaccine]]s.&lt;ref name="Newschaffer" /&gt; Among these factors, vaccines have attracted much attention, as parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination, and parental concern about vaccines has led to a decreasing uptake of [[childhood immunizations]] and an increasing likelihood of [[Measles#Public health|measles outbreaks]].{{Citation needed|reason=no citation for claim|date=August 2017}} However, there is overwhelming scientific evidence showing no causal association between the [[MMR vaccine controversy|measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism]], and there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine preservative [[Thiomersal controversy|thiomersal]] causes autism.&lt;ref name="Doja"&gt;{{vcite journal|journal=Can J Neurol Sci|year=2006|volume=33|issue=4|pages=341–346|title=Immunizations and autism: a review of the literature|author=Doja A, Roberts W|pmid=17168158|type=Review|doi=10.1017/s031716710000528x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Schultz ST|title=Does thimerosal or other mercury exposure increase the risk for autism?

==Genetics==
{{main article|Heritability of autism}}

Genetic factors may be the most significant cause for autism spectrum disorders. Early studies of twins had estimated [[heritability]] to be over 90%, meaning that genetics explains over 90% of whether a child will develop autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freitag|first1=C M|title=The genetics of autistic disorders and its clinical relevance: a review of the literature|journal=Molecular Psychiatry|date=10 October 2006|volume=12|issue=1|pages=2–22|doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001896|pmid=17033636}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this may be an overestimation, as new twin studies estimate the heritability at between 60–90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hallmayer|first1=Joachim|title=Genetic Heritability and Shared Environmental Factors Among Twin Pairs With Autism|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|date=1 November 2011|volume=68|issue=11|pages=1095|doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.76|pmc=4440679}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ronald|first1=Angelica|last2=Hoekstra|first2=Rosa A.|title=Autism spectrum disorders and autistic traits: A decade of new twin studies|journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part B|date=April 2011|volume=156|issue=3|pages=255–274|doi=10.1002/ajmg.b.31159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the non-autistic co-twins had learning or social disabilities. For adult siblings the risk for having one or more features of the broader autism phenotype might be as high as 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Folstein SE, Rosen-Sheidley B|title=Genetics of autism: complex aetiology for a heterogeneous disorder|journal=Nat Rev Genet|year=2001|volume=2|issue=12|pages=943–955|doi=10.1038/35103559|pmid=11733747|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in spite of the strong heritability, most cases of ASD occur sporadically with no recent evidence of family history. It has been hypothesized that spontaneous [[Mutation#By inheritance|''de novo'' mutation]]s in the father's sperm or mother's egg contribute to the likelihood of developing autism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sebat|first1=J.|last2=Lakshmi|first2=B.|last3=Malhotra|first3=D.|last4=Troge|first4=J.|last5=Lese-Martin|first5=C.|last6=Walsh|first6=T.|last7=Yamrom|first7=B.|last8=Yoon|first8=S.|last9=Krasnitz|first9=A.|last10=Kendall|first10=J.|last11=Leotta|first11=A.|last12=Pai|first12=D.|last13=Zhang|first13=R.|last14=Lee|first14=Y.-H.|last15=Hicks|first15=J.|last16=Spence|first16=S.

First, individuals with autism have significantly reduced fecundity, they are 20 times less likely to have children than average, thus curtailing the persistence of mutations in ASD genes over multiple generations in a family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Uher|first1=R|title=The role of genetic variation in the causation of mental illness: an evolution-informed framework|journal=Molecular Psychiatry|date=25 August 2009|volume=14|issue=12|pages=1072–1082|doi=10.1038/mp.2009.85|pmid=19704409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the likelihood of having a child develop autism increases with advancing paternal age,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hultman|first1=C M|last2=Sandin|first2=S|last3=Levine|first3=S Z|last4=Lichtenstein|first4=P|last5=Reichenberg|first5=A|title=Advancing paternal age and risk of autism: new evidence from a population-based study and a meta-analysis of epidemiological studies|journal=Molecular Psychiatry|date=30 November 2010|volume=16|issue=12|pages=1203–1212|doi=10.1038/mp.2010.121|pmid=21116277}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mutations in sperm gradually accumulate throughout a man's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kong|first1=Augustine|last2=Frigge|first2=Michael L.|last3=Masson|first3=Gisli|last4=Besenbacher|first4=Soren|last5=Sulem|first5=Patrick|last6=Magnusson|first6=Gisli|last7=Gudjonsson|first7=Sigurjon A.|last8=Sigurdsson|first8=Asgeir|last9=Jonasdottir|first9=Aslaug|last10=Jonasdottir|first10=Adalbjorg|last11=Wong|first11=Wendy S.

The first genes to be definitively shown to contribute to risk for autism were found in the early 1990s by researchers looking at gender-specific forms of autism caused by mutations on the X chromosome.
An expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in the [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] of the gene ''[[FMR1]]'' in boys causes [[fragile X syndrome]], and at least 20% of boys with this mutation have behaviors consistent with autism spectrum disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hatton|first1=Deborah D.|last2=Sideris|first2=John|last3=Skinner|first3=Martie|last4=Mankowski|first4=Jean|last5=Bailey|first5=Donald B.|last6=Roberts|first6=Jane|last7=Mirrett|first7=Penny|title=Autistic behavior in children with fragile X syndrome: Prevalence, stability, and the impact of FMRP|journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A|date=1 September 2006|volume=140A|issue=17|pages=1804–1813|doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.31286|pmid=16700053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutations that inactivate the gene ''[[MECP2]]'' cause [[Rett syndrome]], which is associated with autistic behaviors in girls, and in boys the mutation is embryonic lethal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zoghbi|first1=Huda Y.|last2=Amir|first2=Ruthie E.|last3=Van den Veyver|first3=Ignatia B.|last4=Wan|first4=Mimi|last5=Tran|first5=Charles Q.|last6=Francke|first6=Uta|journal=Nature Genetics|date=1 October 1999|volume=23|issue=2|pages=185–188|doi=10.1038/13810|pmid=10508514|title=Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in X-linked MECP2, encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides these early examples, the role of ''de novo'' mutations in ASD first became evident when [[DNA microarray]] technologies reached sufficient resolution to allow the detection of [[copy number variation]] (CNV) in the human genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sebat|first1=J.|title=Large-Scale Copy Number Polymorphism in the Human Genome|journal=Science|date=23 July 2004|volume=305|issue=5683|pages=525–528|doi=10.1126/science.1098918|pmid=15273396}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Iafrate|first1=A John|last2=Feuk|first2=Lars|last3=Rivera|first3=Miguel N|last4=Listewnik|first4=Marc L|last5=Donahoe|first5=Patricia K|last6=Qi|first6=Ying|last7=Scherer|first7=Stephen W|last8=Lee|first8=Charles|title=Detection of large-scale variation in the human genome|journal=Nature Genetics|date=1 August 2004|volume=36|issue=9|pages=949–951|doi=10.1038/ng1416|pmid=15286789}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNVs are the most common type of [[structural variation]] in the genome, consisting of deletions and duplications of DNA that range in size from a [[kilobase]] to a few [[megabase]]s. Microarray analysis has shown that ''de novo'' CNVs occur at a significantly higher rate in sporadic cases of autism as compared to the rate in their typically developing siblings and unrelated controls.

CNV studies were closely followed by [[exome sequencing]] studies, which sequence the 1–2% of the genome that codes for proteins (the "[[exome]]").

The conclusion of these recent studies of ''de novo'' mutation is that the spectrum of autism is breaking up into quanta of individual disorders defined by genetics.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

==Epigenetics==
{{Main article|Epigenetics of autism}}
[[Epigenetic]] mechanisms may increase the risk of autism. Epigenetic changes occur as a result not of DNA sequence changes but of chromosomal histone modification or modification of the DNA bases. Such modifications are known to be affected by environmental factors, including nutrition, drugs, and mental stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Miyake K, Hirasawa T, Koide T, Kubota T |title=Epigenetics in autism and other neurodevelopmental diseases |journal=Adv.

==Prenatal environment==
The risk of autism is associated with several [[prenatal]] risk factors, including advanced age in either parent, diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Gardener"&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Gardener H, Spiegelman D, Buka SL |title=Prenatal risk factors for autism: comprehensive meta-analysis |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=195 |issue=1 |pages=7–14 |year=2009 |pmid=19567888 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.108.051672 |pmc=3712619 |type=Review, meta-analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autism has been linked to birth defect agents acting during the first eight weeks from [[Human fertilization|conception]], though these cases are rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Roullet FI, Lai JK, Foster JA |title=In utero exposure to valproic acid and autism--a current review of clinical and animal studies |journal=Neurotoxicol Teratol |volume=36 |issue= |pages=47–56 |year=2013 |pmid=23395807 |doi=10.1016/j.ntt.2013.01.004 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infectious processes===
Prenatal viral infection has been called the principal non-genetic cause of autism. Prenatal exposure to [[rubella]] or [[cytomegalovirus]] activates the mother's [[immune response]] and may greatly increases the risk for autism in mice.&lt;ref name="Libbey" /&gt; [[Congenital rubella syndrome]] is the most convincing environmental cause of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= Semin Pediatr Neurol |year=2008 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=27–31 |title= Genetic evaluation of autism |author= Mendelsohn NJ, Schaefer GB |doi=10.1016/j.spen.2008.01.005 |pmid=18342258|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infection-associated immunological events in early pregnancy may affect neural development more than infections in late pregnancy, not only for autism, but also for psychiatric disorders of presumed neurodevelopmental origin, notably [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Neuroscientist |year=2007 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=241–56|title= The neurodevelopmental impact of prenatal infections at different times of pregnancy: the earlier the worse? |author= Meyer U, Yee BK, Feldon J |pmid=17519367 |doi=10.1177/1073858406296401|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental agents===
[[Teratogen]]s are environmental agents that cause [[birth defect]]s. Some agents that are theorized to cause birth defects have also been suggested as potential autism risk factors, although there is little to no scientific evidence to back such claims. These include exposure of the embryo to [[valproic acid]],&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Chomiak T, Turner N, Hu B |title=What We Have Learned about Autism Spectrum Disorder from Valproic Acid |journal=Patholog Res Int |volume=2013 |issue= |pages=712758 |year=2013 |pmid=24381784 |pmc=3871912 |doi=10.1155/2013/712758 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[paracetamol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Avella-Garcia CB, Julvez J, Fortuny J, Rebordosa C, García-Esteban R, Galán IR, Tardón A, Rodríguez-Bernal CL, Iñiguez C, Andiarena A, Santa-Marina L, Sunyer J |title=Acetaminophen use in pregnancy and neurodevelopment: attention function and autism spectrum symptoms |journal=Int J Epidemiol |pmid=27353198 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyw115}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[thalidomide]] or [[misoprostol]].&lt;ref name="Dufour2011" /&gt; These cases are rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Miller MT, Strömland K, Ventura L, Johansson M, Bandim JM, Gillberg C |title=Autism associated with conditions characterized by developmental errors in early embryogenesis: a mini review |journal=Int.

===Other maternal conditions===
[[Thyroid]] problems that lead to [[thyroxine]] deficiency in the mother in weeks 8–12 of pregnancy have been postulated to produce changes in the fetal brain leading to autism. Thyroxine deficiencies can be caused by inadequate [[iodine]] in the diet, and by environmental agents that [[Goitrogen|interfere with iodine uptake]] or [[Antithyroid agent|act against thyroid hormones]]. Possible environmental agents include [[flavonoid]]s in food, [[tobacco smoke]], and most [[herbicide]]s. This hypothesis has not been tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author= Román GC |title=Autism: transient ''in utero'' hypothyroxinemia related to maternal flavonoid ingestion during pregnancy and to other environmental antithyroid agents |journal= J Neurol Sci |volume=262 |issue=1–2 |pages=15–26 |year=2007 |pmid=17651757 |doi=10.1016/j.jns.2007.06.023|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diabetes in the mother during pregnancy is a significant risk factor for autism; a 2009 meta-analysis found that [[gestational diabetes]] was associated with a twofold increased risk. A 2014 review also found that maternal diabetes was significantly associated with an increased risk of ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Xu, Guifeng|title=Maternal Diabetes and the Risk of Autism Spectrum Disorders in the Offspring: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|date=22 September 2013|volume=44|issue=4|pages=766–775|doi=10.1007/s10803-013-1928-2|pmid=24057131|pmc=4181720}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although diabetes causes metabolic and hormonal abnormalities and [[oxidative stress]], no biological mechanism is known for the association between gestational diabetes and autism risk.&lt;ref name="Gardener" /&gt;

Maternal obesity during pregnancy may also increase the risk of autism, although further study is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Li YM et al.|title=Association Between Maternal Obesity and Autism Spectrum Disorder in Offspring: A Meta-analysis|journal=J Autism Dev Disord|year=2015|doi=10.1007/s10803-015-2549-8|pmid=26254893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other ''in utero''===
It has been hypothesized that [[folic acid]] taken during pregnancy could play a role in reducing cases of autism by modulating [[gene expression]] through an [[epigenetic]] mechanism. This hypothesis is supported by multiple studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Lyall K, Schimdt RJ, Hertz-Picciotto I|title=Maternal lifestyle and environmental risk factors for autism spectrum disorders|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|date=11 February 2014|volume=43|issue=2|pages=443–464|doi=10.1093/ije/dyt282|pmid=24518932|pmc=3997376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prenatal stress]], consisting of exposure to life events or environmental factors that distress an expectant mother, has been hypothesized to contribute to autism, possibly as part of a gene-environment interaction. Autism has been reported to be associated with prenatal stress both with retrospective studies that examined stressors such as job loss and family discord, and with natural experiments involving prenatal exposure to storms; animal studies have reported that prenatal stress can disrupt brain development and produce behaviors resembling symptoms of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= Neurosci Biobehav Rev |year=2008 |title= Prenatal stress and risk for autism |author= Kinney DK, Munir KM, Crowley DJ, Miller AM |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.06.004 |pmid=18598714 |volume=32 |issue=8 |pages=1519–32 |pmc= 2632594|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other studies have cast doubts on this association, notably population based studies in England and Sweden finding no link between stressful life events and ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0038893| pmid=22719977| pmc=3374800|title = Prenatal and Early Life Exposure to Stressful Life Events and Risk of Autism Spectrum Disorders: Population-Based Studies in Sweden and England| journal=PLOS ONE| volume=7| issue=6| pages=e38893|year = 2012|last1 = Rai|first1 = Dheeraj| last2=Golding| first2=Jean| last3=Magnusson| first3=Cecilia| last4=Steer| first4=Colin| last5=Lewis| first5=Glyn| last6=Dalman| first6=Christina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fetal testosterone theory hypothesizes that higher levels of [[testosterone]] in the [[amniotic fluid]] of mothers pushes brain development towards improved ability to see patterns and analyze complex systems while diminishing communication and empathy, emphasizing "male" traits over "female", or in [[E-S theory]] terminology, emphasizing "systemizing" over "empathizing". One project has published several reports suggesting that high levels of fetal testosterone could produce behaviors relevant to those seen in autism.&lt;ref&gt;Fetal testosterone and autistic traits:

Based in part on animal studies, diagnostic [[ultrasound]]s administered during pregnancy have been hypothesized to increase the child's risk of autism. This hypothesis is not supported by independently published research, and examination of children whose mothers received an ultrasound has failed to find evidence of harmful effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Abramowicz JS |title=Ultrasound and autism: association, link, or coincidence? |journal=J Ultrasound Med |volume=31 |issue=8 |pages=1261–9 |year=2012 |month=August |pmid=22837291  |url=http://www.jultrasoundmed.org/content/31/8/1261.long |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research suggests that maternal exposure to [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of autism, but it remains unclear whether there is a causal link between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Man KK, Tong HH, Wong LY, Chan EW, Simonoff E, Wong IC|title=Exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy and risk of autism spectrum disorder in children: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies|journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|date=9 December 2014|volume=49C|pages=82–89|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.11.020|pmid=25498856}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence, for example, that this association may be an artifact of confounding by maternal mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Brown HK, Hussain-Shamsy N, Lunsky Y, Dennis CE, Vigod SN|title=The Association Between Antenatal Exposure to Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Autism: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.|journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|date=January 2017|volume=78|issue=1|pages=e48–e58|doi=10.4088/JCP.15r10194|pmid=28129495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perinatal environment==
Autism is associated with some [[perinatal]] and [[obstetric]] conditions. A 2007 review of [[risk factors]] found associated obstetric conditions that included [[low birth weight]] and [[gestation]] duration, and [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] during [[childbirth]]. This association does not demonstrate a causal relationship. As a result, an underlying cause could explain both autism and these associated conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author= Kolevzon A, Gross R, Reichenberg A |title= Prenatal and perinatal risk factors for autism |journal= Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |volume=161 |issue=4 |year=2007 |pages=326–333 |pmid=17404128 |doi= 10.1001/archpedi.161.4.326|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is growing evidence that perinatal exposure to [[air pollution]] may be a risk factor for autism,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |

==Postnatal environment==
A wide variety of postnatal contributors to autism have been proposed, including gastrointestinal or immune system abnormalities, allergies, and exposure of children to drugs, vaccines, infection, certain foods, or heavy metals. The evidence for these risk factors is anecdotal and has not been confirmed by reliable studies.&lt;ref name="Rutter"&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Rutter M|title=Incidence of autism spectrum disorders: changes over time and their meaning|journal=Acta Paediatr|volume=94|issue=1|year=2005|pages=2–15|pmid=15858952|doi=10.1111/j.1651-2227.2005.tb01779.x|authorlink=Michael Rutter|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amygdala neurons===
This theory hypothesizes that an early developmental failure involving the [[amygdala]] cascades on the development of cortical areas that mediate social perception in the visual domain. The [[fusiform face area]] of the [[ventral stream]] is implicated. The idea is that it is involved in social knowledge and social cognition, and that the deficits in this network are instrumental in causing autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|journal=Int J Dev Neurosci|year=2005|volume=23|issue=2–3|pages=125–41|title=Developmental deficits in social perception in autism: the role of the amygdala and fusiform face area|author=Schultz RT|doi=10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2004.12.012|pmid=15749240|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autoimmune disease===
This theory hypothesizes that autoantibodies that target the brain or elements of brain metabolism may cause or exacerbate autism. It is related to the [[#Maternal infection|maternal infection]] theory, except that it postulates that the effect is caused by the individual's own antibodies, possibly due to an environmental trigger after birth. It is also related to several other hypothesized causes; for example, [[#Viral infection|viral infection]] has been hypothesized to cause autism via an autoimmune mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= Autoimmun Rev |year=2004 |volume=3 |issue=7–8 |pages=557–562 |title= Is autism an autoimmune disease? |title.= |author= Ashwood P, Van de Water J |doi=10.1016/j.autrev.2004.07.036 |pmid=15546805 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interactions between the [[immune system]] and the nervous system begin early during [[embryogenesis]], and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response. It is possible that aberrant immune activity during critical periods of neurodevelopment is part of the mechanism of some forms of ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Leukoc Biol |year=2006 |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=1–15 |title=The immune response in autism: a new frontier for autism research |author=[[Paul Ashwood|Ashwood P]], Wills S, Van de Water J |doi=10.1189/jlb.1205707 |pmid=16698940 |url=http://www.jleukbio.org/cgi/content/full/80/1/1 |type=Review |accessdate=2008-02-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005180253/http://www.jleukbio.org/cgi/content/full/80/1/1# |archivedate=2006-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A small percentage of autism cases are associated with infection, usually before birth. Results from immune studies have been contradictory. Some abnormalities have been found in specific subgroups, and some of these have been replicated. It is not known whether these abnormalities are relevant to the pathology of autism, for example, by infection or autoimmunity, or whether they are secondary to the disease processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Res Autism Spectr Disord |volume=3 |issue=4 |year=2009 |pages=840–860 |doi=10.1016/j.rasd.2009.01.007 |author=Stigler KA, Sweeten TL, Posey DJ, McDougle CJ |title=Autism and immune factors: a comprehensive review |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[autoantibodies]] are found in diseases other than ASD, and are not always present in ASD,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= Ann N Y Acad Sci |year=2007 |volume=1107 |pages=79–91 |title= Autoantibodies in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) |author= Wills S, Cabanlit M, Bennett J, Ashwood P, Amaral D, Van de Water J |doi=10.1196/annals.1381.009 |pmid=17804535|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; the relationship between immune disturbances and autism remains unclear and controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol |year=2008 |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=4–11 |title= The neuropathology of autism: where do we stand? |title.= |author= Schmitz C, Rezaie P |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2990.2007.00872.x |pmid=17971078|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis found that children with a family history of autoimmune diseases were at a greater risk of autism compared to children without such a history.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|title=Family history of autoimmune diseases is associated with an increased risk of autism in children: A systematic review and meta-analysis.|author=Wu S|journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|date=15 May 2015|volume=55|pages=322–332|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2015.05.004|pmid=25981892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an underlying maternal autoimmune disease is present, antibodies circulating to the fetus could contribute to the development of autism spectrum disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Fox E, Amaral D, Van de Water J |title=Maternal and fetal antibrain antibodies in development and disease |journal=Dev Neurobiol |volume=72 |issue=10 |pages=1327–1334 |year=2012 |month=October |pmid=22911883 |doi=10.1002/dneu.22052 |pmc=3478666|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endogenous opiate precursor theory===
{{Main article|Opioid excess theory}}
In 1979, [[Jaak Panksepp]] proposed a connection between autism and opiates, noting that injections of minute quantities of opiates in young laboratory animals induce symptoms similar to those observed among autistic children.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Panksepp J | year = 1979 | title = A neurochemical theory of autism | url = | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 174–177 | doi=10.1016/0166-2236(79)90071-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opiate theory hypothesizes that autism is caused by a digestive disorder present from birth which causes gluten (present in wheat-derived foods) and casein (present in dairy products) to be converted to the opioid peptides [[gliadorphin]] (aka gluteomorphin) and [[casomorphin]]. 
	 	
According to the theory, exposure to these opiate compounds in young children interferes with normal neurological development by dulling sensory input. Lacking sufficient sensory input, the developing brain attempts to artificially generate the auditory, vestibular, visual, and tactile input on its own. This attempt at generating input manifests itself as behaviors common to autism, such as grunting or screaming (auditory), spinning or rocking back and forth (vestibular), preoccupation with spinning objects or waving of the fingers in front of the eyes (visual), and hand flapping or self-injury (tactile).

The theory further states that removing opiate precursors from a child's diet may allow time for these behaviors to cease, and neurological development in very young children to resume normally.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= J Dev Behav Pediatr |year=2006 |volume=27 |issue=2 Suppl 2 |pages=S162–171 |title= Elimination diets in autism spectrum disorders: any wheat amidst the chaff? |author= Christison GW, Ivany K |pmid=16685183 |doi= 10.1097/00004703-200604002-00015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of a relationship between autism and the consumption of gluten and casein was first articulated by [[Kalle Reichelt]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Reichelt KL, Knivsberg A-M, Lind G, Nødland M | year = 1991 | title = Probable etiology and possible treatment of childhood autism | url = | journal = Brain Dysfunct | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 308–319 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific evidence is not yet adequate to make treatment recommendations regarding diets, such as the [[Gluten-free, casein-free diet|GFCF diet]], which exclude these substances.&lt;ref&gt;Shattock P, Whiteley P. (2002) "Biochemical aspects in autism spectrum disorders: updating the opioid-excess theory and presenting new opportunities for biomedical intervention" "Autism Research Unit, University of Sunderland, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gastrointestinal connection===
Parents have reported [[gastrointestinal]] (GI) disturbances in autistic children, and several studies have investigated possible associations between autism and the gut,&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= Top Clin Nutr |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=212–225 |year=2006 |author= Johnson TW |title= Dietary considerations in autism: identifying a reasonable approach |doi=10.1097/00008486-200607000-00008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the results so far are inconclusive.

There is some research evidence that autistic children are more likely to have GI symptoms than typical children.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=McElhanon BO, McCracken C, Karpen S, Sharp WG |title=Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Meta-analysis |journal=Pediatrics |volume=133 |issue=5 |pages=872–883 |year=2014 |month=May |pmid=24777214 |doi=10.1542/peds.2013-3995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, design flaws in studies of elimination diets mean that the data are inadequate to guide treatment recommendations.&lt;ref name="Christison"&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= J Dev Behav Pediatr |year=2006 |volume=27 |issue= 2 Suppl 2 |pages=S162–171 |title= Elimination diets in autism spectrum disorders: any wheat amidst the chaff? |title.= |author= Christison GW, Ivany K |pmid= 16685183|doi= 10.1097/00004703-200604002-00015|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a preliminary 1998 study of three children with ASD treated with [[secretin]] infusion reported improved GI function and dramatic improvement in behavior, many parents sought secretin treatment and a black market for the hormone developed quickly.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; Later studies found secretin clearly ineffective in treating autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Krishnaswami S, McPheeters ML, Veenstra-Vanderweele J |title=A systematic review of secretin for children with autism spectrum disorders |journal=Pediatrics |volume=127 |issue=5 |pages=e1322–1325 |year=2011 |month=May |pmid=21464196 |pmc=3387870 |doi=10.1542/peds.2011-0428 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of vitamin D===
The hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency has a role in autism is biologically plausible, but not researched.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Kočovská E, Fernell E, Billstedt E, Minnis H, Gillberg C |title=Vitamin D and autism: clinical review |journal=Res Dev Disabil |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=1541–1550 |year=2012 |pmid=22522213 |doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2012.02.015 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lead===
[[Lead poisoning]] has been suggested as a possible risk factor for autism, as the [[lead]] blood levels of autistic children has been reported to be significantly higher than typical.&lt;ref name="Zafeiriou2006"&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= Brain Dev |year=2007 |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=257–272 |title= Childhood autism and associated comorbidities |author= Zafeiriou DI, Ververi A, Vargiami E |doi=10.1016/j.braindev.2006.09.003 |pmid=17084999|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The atypical eating  behaviors of autistic children, along with habitual mouthing and [[pica (disorder)|pica]], make it hard to determine whether increased lead levels are a cause or a consequence of autism.&lt;ref name="Zafeiriou2006" /&gt;

===Locus coeruleus–noradrenergic system===
This theory hypothesizes that autistic behaviors depend at least in part on a developmental dysregulation that results in impaired function of the [[locus coeruleus]]–[[noradrenergic]] (LC-NA) system. The LC-NA system is heavily involved in arousal and attention; for example, it is related to the brain's acquisition and use of environmental cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author= Mehler MF, Purpura DP |title= Autism, fever, epigenetics and the locus coeruleus |journal= Brain Res Rev |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=388–392 |year=2009 |pmid=19059284 |doi=10.1016/j.brainresrev.2008.11.001 |laysummary=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1889436,00.html |laysource=TIME |laydate=2009-04-07 |pmc= 2668953|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mercury===
This theory hypothesizes that autism is associated with [[mercury poisoning]], based on perceived similarity of symptoms and reports of mercury or its biomarkers in some autistic children.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Int J Risk Saf Med |year=2008 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=135–142 |title=An epidemiological analysis of the 'autism as mercury poisoning' hypothesis |author= Austin D |doi=10.3233/JRS-2008-0436 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has gained little traction in the scientific community as the [[Mercury toxicity#Signs and symptoms|typical symptoms of mercury toxicity]] are significantly different from [[Autism#Characteristics|symptoms seen in autism]].&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{vcite journal |author= Nelson KB, Bauman ML |title= Thimerosal and autism? |journal=Pediatrics |volume=111 |issue=3 |pages=674–679 |year=2003 |pmid=12612255 |doi=10.1542/peds.111.3.674 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/111/3/674|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The principal source of human exposure to organic mercury is via fish consumption and for inorganic mercury is [[dental amalgam]]s. The evidence so far is indirect for the association between autism and mercury exposure after birth, as no direct test has been reported, and there is no evidence of an association between autism and postnatal exposure to any neurotoxicant.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Pediatrics |year=2004 |volume=113 |issue=4 Suppl |pages=1023–1029 |title=Mercury exposure and child development outcomes |author=Davidson PW, Myers GJ, Weiss B |pmid=15060195 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/Supplement_3/1023.long|doi=10.1542/peds.113.4.S1.1023|type=Review, historical article}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A meta-analysis published in 2007 concluded that there was no link between mercury and autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|journal=Pediatr Int|year=2007|volume=49|issue=1|pages=80–87|title=Low-level chronic mercury exposure in children and adolescents: meta-analysis|author=Ng DK, Chan CH, Soo MT, Lee RS|doi=10.1111/j.1442-200X.2007.02303.x|pmid=17250511 |type=Meta-analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxidative stress===
This theory hypothesizes that toxicity and [[oxidative stress]] may cause autism in some cases. Evidence includes genetic effects on metabolic pathways, reduced antioxidant capacity, enzyme changes, and enhanced biomarkers for oxidative stress; however, the overall evidence is weaker than it is for involvement oxidative stress with disorders such as [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= Int J Neuropsychopharmacol |year=2008 |title= Oxidative stress in psychiatric disorders: evidence base and therapeutic implications |author= Ng F, Berk M, Dean O, Bush AI |doi=10.1017/S1461145707008401 |pmid=18205981 |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=851–876|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; One theory is that stress damages [[Purkinje cell]]s in the [[cerebellum]] after birth, and it is possible that [[glutathione]] is involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|journal=J Toxicol Environ Health B Crit Rev|year=2006 |volume=9|issue=6|pages=485–499|title=Evidence of toxicity, oxidative stress, and neuronal insult in autism|author=Kern JK, Jones AM|doi=10.1080/10937400600882079|pmid=17090484|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Autistic children have lower levels of total glutathione, and higher levels of oxidized glutathione.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Ghanizadeh A, Akhondzadeh S, Hormozi M, Makarem A, Abotorabi-Zarchi M, Firoozabadi A |title=Glutathione-related factors and oxidative stress in autism, a review |journal=Curr.

=== Refrigerator mother ===
{{main article|Refrigerator mother}}

[[Bruno Bettelheim]] believed that autism was linked to early childhood trauma, and his work was highly influential for decades both in the medical and popular spheres.

Parents, especially mothers, of individuals with autism were blamed for having caused their child's condition through the withholding of affection.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author= Bettelheim B |title= The Empty Fortress: Infantile Autism and the Birth of the Self |year=1967 |publisher= Free Press |isbn=0-02-903140-0 |authorlink= Bruno Bettelheim}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo Kanner]], who first described autism,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author= Kanner L |title= Autistic disturbances of affective contact |journal= Nerv Child |volume=2 |pages=217–250 |year=1943 |authorlink= Leo Kanner}} Reprinted in {{vcite journal |year=1968 |journal=Acta Paedopsychiatr |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=100–136 |pmid=4880460 |author=&lt;!-- Pacify Citation bot --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that parental coldness might contribute to autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= [[Am J Orthopsychiatry]] |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=416–426 |year=1949 |author=Kanner L |title= Problems of nosology and psychodynamics in early childhood autism |pmid=18146742 |doi=10.1111/j.1939-0025.1949.tb05441.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kanner eventually renounced the theory, Bettelheim put an almost exclusive emphasis on it in both his medical and his popular books. Treatments based on these theories failed to help children with autism, and after Bettelheim's death, it came out that his reported rates of cure (around 85%) were found to be fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= Skeptical Inquirer |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=12–14 |year=2000 |title= The brutality of Dr. Bettelheim |author=Gardner M |authorlink= Martin Gardner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viral infection===
Many studies have presented evidence for and against association of autism with viral infection after birth. Laboratory rats infected with [[Borna disease virus]] show some symptoms similar to those of autism but blood studies of autistic children show no evidence of infection by this virus. Members of the [[Herpesviridae|herpes virus family]] may have a role in autism, but the evidence so far is anecdotal. Viruses have long been suspected as triggers for immune-mediated diseases such as [[multiple sclerosis]] but showing a direct role for viral causation is difficult in those diseases, and mechanisms whereby viral infections could lead to autism are speculative.&lt;ref name="Libbey"&gt;{{vcite journal|journal=J Neurovirol|year=2005|volume=11|issue=1|pages=1–10|title=Autistic disorder and viral infections|author=Libbey JE, Sweeten TL, McMahon WM, Fujinami RS|doi=10.1080/13550280590900553|pmid=15804954|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social construct===
The [[social construct]] theory says that the boundary between normal and abnormal is subjective and arbitrary, so autism does not exist as an objective entity, but only as a social construct. It further argues that autistic individuals themselves have a way of being that is partly socially constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book|isbn=0-674-00412-4|author=Hacking I|title=The Social Construction of What?|title.= |publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1999|pages=114–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asperger syndrome]] and [[high-functioning autism]] are particular targets of the theory that social factors determine what it means to be autistic. The theory hypothesizes that individuals with these diagnoses inhabit the identities that have been ascribed to them, and promote their sense of well-being by resisting or appropriating autistic ascriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |chapter= The dialectics of autism: theorizing autism, performing autism, remediating autism, and resisting autism |title= Constructing Autism: Unravelling the 'Truth' and Understanding the Social |author= Nadesan MH |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-32181-6 |year=2005 |pages=179–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[MMR vaccine]] as a cause of autism is one of the most extensively debated hypotheses regarding the origins of autism. [[Andrew Wakefield]] ''et al.'' reported a study of 12 children who had autism and bowel symptoms, in some cases reportedly with onset after MMR.&lt;ref name="Retraction" /&gt;  Although the paper, which was later retracted by the journal,&lt;ref name="Retraction" /&gt; concluded "We did not prove an association between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described,"&lt;ref name="Wakefield1998"&gt;{{vcite journal |author= [[Andrew Wakefield|Wakefield A]], Murch S, Anthony A ''et al.''  |title= Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children |journal=Lancet |volume=351 |issue=9103 |pages=637–641 |year=1998 | note = doi was 10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0 and URL was http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm|pmid=9500320 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0}}{{Retracted paper|{{DOI|10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60175-7}}|intentional=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wakefield nevertheless suggested during a 1998 press conference that giving children the vaccines in three separate doses would be safer than a single dose.

In 2004, the interpretation of a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism was formally retracted by ten of Wakefield's twelve co-authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author= Murch SH, Anthony A, Casson DH ''et al.'' |author.= |title= Retraction of an interpretation |year=2004 |journal=Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9411 |pages=750 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15715-2 |pmid=15016483}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retraction followed an investigation by ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', which stated that Wakefield "acted dishonestly and irresponsibly".&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |url=http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-summary.htm |title= The MMR-autism crisis – our story so far |accessdate=2008-12-06 |author= Deer B |date=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]],&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{vcite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/mmr_vaccine.htm |title= Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine |date=2008-12-23 |accessdate=2009-02-14 |publisher= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Institute of Medicine]] of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]],&lt;ref name="IOM2004"&gt;{{vcite web |url=http://www.iom.edu/CMS/3793/4705/20155.aspx |title=Immunization safety review: vaccines and autism |publisher=Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences |year=2004 |accessdate=2007-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623134938/http://www.iom.edu/CMS/3793/4705/20155.aspx |archivedate=2007-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the U.K. [[National Health Service]]&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |url=http://www.mmrthefacts.nhs.uk/ |accessdate=2007-06-13 |title=MMR the facts |publisher=National Health Service |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615000359/http://www.mmrthefacts.nhs.uk/ |archivedate=2007-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; have all concluded that there is no evidence of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism.

In February 2010, ''The Lancet'', which published Wakefield's study, fully retracted it after an independent auditor found the study to be flawed.&lt;ref name="Retraction"&gt;{{vcite journal |title=Retraction – Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children |journal=Lancet |volume=375 |issue=9713 |pages=445 |date=2010-02-06 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60175-4 |laysource=BBC News |laydate=2010-02-02 |laysummary=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/health/8493753.stm |pmid=20137807}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, an investigation published in the journal ''BMJ'' described the Wakefield study as the result of deliberate fraud and manipulation of data.&lt;ref name="WakefieldarticleBMJ"&gt;{{vcite journal |year=2011 |doi=10.1136/bmj.c7452 |pages=c7452 |volume=342 |title=Wakefield's article linking MMR vaccine and autism was fraudulent |author=Godlee F, Smith J, Marcovitch H |journal=[[BMJ]] |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452.full |pmid=21209060}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BMJ2011"&gt;{{vcite journal |title=How the case against the MMR vaccine was fixed| author=Deer B| journal=BMJ| year=2011| volume=342| pages=c5347| url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c5347.full |doi= 10.1136/bmj.c5347| pmid=21209059}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NPRWakefield"&gt;{{vcite news |url= https://www.npr.org/2011/01/05/132692497/journal-study-linking-vaccine-to-autism-was-fraud |publisher=NPR | agency=Associated Press |title=Study linking vaccine to autism was fraud |date=2011-01-05 |accessdate= 2011-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN2011"&gt;{{vcite news |title=Retracted autism study an 'elaborate fraud,' British journal finds  |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/01/05/autism.vaccines/index.html |date=2011-01-06 |accessdate=2011-01-06 | location=Atlanta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thiomersal (thimerosal)====
{{main article|Thiomersal controversy}}

Perhaps the best-known hypothesis involving mercury and autism involves the use of the mercury-based compound [[thiomersal]], a preservative that has been phased out from most childhood [[vaccination]]s in developed countries including US and the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/ucm096228.htm#thi| title= Vaccines, blood and biologics:  thimerosal in vaccines |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration |year=2012 |accessdate= October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination. There is no scientific evidence for a causal connection between thiomersal and autism, but parental concern about the [[thiomersal controversy]] has led to decreasing rates of [[childhood immunizations]]&lt;ref name="Doja" /&gt; and increasing likelihood of disease outbreaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Eaton L |title=Measles cases in England and Wales rise sharply in 2008 |journal=BMJ |volume=338 |pages=b533 |year=2009 |pmid=19208716 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.b533|url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19208716}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Choi YH, Gay N, Fraser G, Ramsay M |title=The potential for measles transmission in England |journal=BMC Public Health |volume=8 |issue= |pages=338 |year=2008 |pmid=18822142 |pmc=2563003 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-8-338 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, due to concern about the dose of  mercury infants were being exposed to, the U.S. Public Health Service recommended that thiomersal be removed from childhood vaccines, and by 2002 the flu vaccine was the only childhood vaccine containing more than trace amounts of thimerosal. Despite this, autism rates did not decrease after the removal of thimerosal, in the US or other countries that also removed thimerosal from their childhood vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/mercury-in-vaccines-and-autism-a-failed-hypothesis/&lt;/ref&gt;

A causal link between thimerosal and autism has been rejected by international scientific and medical professional bodies including the [[American Medical Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web | author = [[American Medical Association]] | year = 2004-05-18 | url =

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="70383">[[Civil service]] [[reform]] is a deliberate action to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, professionalism, representativity and democratic character of a [[civil service]], with a view to promoting better delivery of [[public goods]] and services, with increased [[accountability]]. Such actions can include data gathering and analysis, organizational [[restructuring]], improving [[human resource management]] and [[training]], enhancing [[wages|pay]] and [[Employee benefit|benefits]] while assuring [[sustainability]] under overall [[finance|fiscal]] constraints, and strengthening measures for [[performance management]], [[public participation]], [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]],  and combating [[Political corruption|corruption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gsdrc.org/topic-guides/civil-service-reform/|title=Civil service reform - GSDRC|work=GSDRC|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil service reform agenda in [[Developing country|developing countries]] has evolved and changed its focus over the decades. The [[academic literature]] on civil service reform has provided arguments and counterarguments clarifying how several approaches to reform affect the overall performance of the civil service.  The increasing availability of empirical [[data]] allows to test the [[effectiveness]] of specific reforms in a given context. While designing effective civil service reforms is a tremendously complex task considering that the right mix of corruption control and performance improvements may vary greatly across and within countries, [[Empirical research|empirical]] as well as [[qualitative research]] can contribute to the body of evidence-based knowledge on civil service reforms in developing countries.

Many challenges remain as persisting [[political economy]] factors hinder the success of civil service reforms.&lt;ref name=":142"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simone|first=Bunse|last2=Verena|first2=Fritz|date=2012-08-01|title=Making public sector reforms work : political and economic contexts, incentives, and strategies|pages=1–54|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/649411468328580569/Making-public-sector-reforms-work-political-and-economic-contexts-incentives-and-strategies|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches to Civil Service Reform ==

=== The Influence of Weberian Bureaucracy ===
[[Max Weber]]'s model of the ideal type of [[public administration]] has been an influential approach to civil service reforms in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/capacity-building/global-centre-for-public-service-excellence/PS-Reform.html|title=From Old Public Administration to the New Public Service|website=UNDP|language=en|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[bureaucratic]] type of administration contrasts with the [[Inheritance|patrimonial]] type in its underlying organizing principles. Weber’s organization of the public administration relies on a clearly defined hierarchical structure with a system of subordination and supervision, a division of labor and specified positions with assigned responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Udy|first=Stanley H.|date=1959|title="Bureaucracy" and "Rationality" in Weber's Organization Theory: An Empirical Study|jstor=2088566|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=24|issue=6|pages=791–795|doi=10.2307/2088566}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to the patrimonial system in which there is no distinction between private and public domains, the [[Weberian bureaucracy]] is defined by its impersonal and impartial character. Civil servants operate according to a set of rules and procedures they must observe.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahlström|first=Carl|last2=Lapuente|first2=Victor|last3=Teorell|first3=Jan|date=2009|title=Bureaucracy, Politics and Corruption|ssrn=1450742|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impartiality is in part attained through the professionalization of the civil service and [[meritocratic]] recruitment through competitive examinations.  For full-time and professionalized civil servants, public office-holding becomes a 'vocation'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Weberian [[ideal-typical]] principles have served as foundations for civil service reforms in developing countries. Scholars and policymakers have been interested in identifying the specific features that determine bureaucratic efficiency and corruption and the mechanisms through which these features increase effectiveness and restrict corrupt behaviour in the civil service.

Empirical studies&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2000-01-01|title=Bureaucratic structure and bureaucratic performance in less developed countries|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272799000444|journal=Journal of Public Economics|language=en|volume=75|issue=1|pages=49–71|doi=10.1016/S0047-2727(99)00044-4|issn=0047-2727|last1=Rauch|first1=James E.|last2=Evans|first2=Peter B.|citeseerx=10.1.1.203.288}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that meritocratic recruitment of public officials in particular is associated with lower corruption levels.  There are several ways in which meritocratic recruitment and promotion can restrict corrupt behaviour. To begin with, administering entry examinations and educational attainment requirements enable the selection of competent civil servants. As a matter of fact, a study by the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2013/03/arezki.htm|title=Degrees of Development- Finance &amp; Development, March 2013|website=www.imf.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that better-educated civil servants are related to lower levels of corruption, better performance including better public finance management and higher [[tax revenue]] mobilization as well as higher [[economic growth]].

Furthermore, the internal promotion and career stability of merit-recruited civil servants create a sense of shared commitment to the 'vocation' of office-holding that establishes '[[Esprit de corps|esprit de corps']], making it harder for corruption to occur.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Other evidence&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; suggests that a professional merit-based civil service preempts corruption not necessarily through the selection of capable officials but rather through the appointment of civil servants whose interests differ from politicians'. Misaligned interests create a coordination problem which prevents corrupt practices and instead introduces a system of mutual monitoring.

=== Employment and Pay Reforms ===
During the 1980s, developing countries subject to [[structural adjustment]] programs (SAPs) experienced fiscal austerity notably manifested through pressures to reduce the public wage bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barbara|first=Nunberg|date=1989-12-31|title=Public sector pay and employment reform : a review of World Bank experience|pages=1|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/424331468739769767/Public-sector-pay-and-employment-reform-a-review-of-World-Bank-experience|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Klitgaard|R.

Public officials may ask for compensation through informal or illegal means and these coping strategies compromise the efficiency and honesty of civil service organizations.

Given these arguments, increasing public officials' wages and other employment benefits has been an important aspect of the civil service reform agenda in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.worldbank.org/publicsector/civilservice/mayseminar/Mukherjee.pdf|title=Civil Service Pay and Reward|last=Mukherjee|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic models based on the early work of [[Gary Becker|Becker]] and [[George Stigler|Stigler]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Becker|first=Gary S.|last2=Stigler|first2=George J.|date=1974-01-01|title=Law Enforcement, Malfeasance, and Compensation of Enforcers|journal=The Journal of Legal Studies|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1086/467507|issn=0047-2530}}&lt;/ref&gt; have had a particular influence on the policy debate.

[[Principal–agent problem|Principal-agent]] models of corruption in the civil service provide a theoretical analysis of the relationship between public service pay and corruption.  The shirking model ([[Shapiro–Stiglitz theory|Shapiro-Stiglitz]]) is centred on the choice public officials who have the opportunity to be corrupt must make. These [[Rationality|rational]] [[Utility maximization problem|utility-maximizing]] agents decide to engage in [[Moral hazard|morally hazardous]] behaviour based on a [[Cost–benefit analysis|cost-benefit analysis]] equating the expected returns to corruption ([[Bribery|bribes]]) to the costs of being corrupt (penalties, potential foregone future earnings).&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/dfid-research-outputs/do-higher-salaries-lower-petty-corruption-a-policy-experiment-on-west-africa-s-highways|title=Do higher salaries lower petty corruption? A policy experiment on West Africa's highways - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption is detected with a certain probability and is punished by job loss or other penalties. The model predicts that, [[Ceteris paribus|all else equal]], higher wages can deter corruption by increasing the value of behaving honestly. However, when bribes are high and punishment and the probability of detection are low, substantial increases in public official's wages may be required to preempt bribery. Another model explaining bureaucratic corruption, the fair-wage model, makes a distinction between need-based and greed-based corruption. According to this theory, public officials are not necessarily driven by greed but find corruption tempting when their salaries do not allow to meet subsistence levels. 'Fairness' is also determined by other factors, such as the salaries of peers within the civil service, private sector wages, social expectations and the status of civil servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gong|first=Ting|last2=Wu|first2=Alfred M.|date=2012-10-08|title=Does Increased Civil Service Pay Deter Corruption?: Evidence from China|ssrn=2158530|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perception of not being paid a fair wage increases corruptibility and also reduces the moral costs of corruption.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klaus|first=Abbink|date=2000|title=Fair Salaries and the Moral Costs of Corruption|url=https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/78377|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model therefore suggests that even modest increases in salaries ensuring 'fair wages' can reduce civil servants' propensity to solicit and accept bribes.

The theoretical linkage between public salary increases and corruption remains ambiguous. In a context of constrained government fiscal resources, the question of [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effectiveness]] to design optimal wage policies arises. A cross-country study by Van Rijckeghem and Weder endeavours to find empirical support for the fair-wage and efficiency wage hypotheses.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2016/12/30/Corruption-and-the-Rate-of-Temptation-Do-Low-Wages-in-the-Civil-Service-Cause-Corruption-2246|title=Corruption and the Rate of Temptation : Do Low Wages in the Civil Service Cause Corruption?|website=IMF|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors conclude that relative government wages are negatively and significantly correlated with measures of corruption but that eradicating corruption would necessitate unrealistic increases in relative wages.  These correlations, however, cannot be interpreted as evidence of a causal relationship going from public sector wages to corruption. Causality may run in the [[Reverse causation|reverse]] direction, pervasive corruption has been shown to reduce tax revenue collection and public expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tanzi|first=Vito|last2=Davoodi|first2=Hamid R.|date=2000-11-01|title=Corruption, Growth, and Public Finances|ssrn=880260|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor public finance performance and strong budgetary pressures due to corruption may in turn sustain low civil service salaries. This [[Endogeneity (econometrics)|endogeneity]] problem complicates the understanding of the relationship between pay reforms and corruption.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Klaus Abbink also tests the fair salary hypothesis in a laboratory experimental setting.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The controlled environment in this experiment allows to isolate and identify the impact of 'fair income' considerations on corrupt behaviour. He finds that public officials in two treatments with different perceptions of 'fairness' behave similarly in a bribery game. In other words, high relative public officials salaries do not alter decisions to be corrupt through fairness considerations. These experimental results substantiate Van Rijckeghem and Weder's findings and cast doubt on the cost-effectiveness of increasing public salaries to combat corruption.

Di Tella and Schargrodsky provide additional evidence with their micro-empirical analysis on wages and [[audit]]ing during a crackdown on corruption in [[Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires, Argentina]] in 1996-97.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Di Tella|first=Rafael|last2=Schargrodsky|first2=Ernesto|date=2003-04-01|title=The Role of Wages and Auditing during a Crackdown on Corruption in the City of Buenos Aires|journal=The Journal of Law and Economics|volume=46|issue=1|pages=269–292|doi=10.1086/345578|issn=0022-2186}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that wage increases can be effective only when combined with intermediate levels of monitoring intensity (the probability of detection in the shirking model). They test their hypotheses using variations in audit intensity during the crackdown on corruption in public hospitals and find that procurement officers’ wages alone have no statistically significant effect on corruption but detect a negative relationship when wages are interacted with audit intensity. The authors make the case that higher wages and monitoring (“carrots and sticks”) should be used simultaneously to act as an effectual anti-corruption strategy.

The literature on public officials' salaries and corruption offers mixed or inconclusive evidence&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/dfid-research-outputs/what-is-the-evidence-of-the-impact-of-increasing-salaries-on-improving-the-performance-of-public-servants-including-teachers-nurses-and-mid-level-occupations-in-low-and-middle-income-countries-is-it-time-to-give-pay-a-chance|title=What is the evidence of the impact of increasing salaries on improving the performance of public servants?

Wage hikes could also have varying effects depending on whether reforms focus on base-salary (unconditional) increases or performance-related pay increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasnain|first=Zahid|last2=Manning|first2=Nick|last3=Pierskalla|first3=Jan Henryk|date=2012|title=Performance-related Pay in the Public Sector: A Review of Theory and Evidence|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/6046|journal=World Bank Policy Research Working Papers|language=English|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decentralization ===
Following the dissatisfaction with [[Centralisation|centralized]] forms of [[governance]], decentralization of public service provision to [[Sub-national entity|sub-national]] governments became a global trend, particularly in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bank|first=World|date=1999|title=World Development Report 1999/2000|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/5982|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Decentralization]] is the transfer of [[authority]], resources and responsibilities from higher to lower levels of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ombudsman.gov.ph/UNDP4/decentralization-and-power-shift-an-imperative-for-good-governance/index.html|title=Decentralization and Power Shift: An Imperative for Good Governance {{!}} UNDP|website=www.ombudsman.gov.ph|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott and Rao&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gsdrc.org/topic-guides/decentralisation-and-local-government/|title=Decentralisation and local government - GSDRC|work=GSDRC|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  distinguish three types of decentralization:

*[[Administration (government)|Administrative]] decentralization refers to the ability of [[local government]]s to hire, fire and set terms of reference for their own employees and on the human resource management and government organization framework.
*Under [[Politics|Political]] or [[Democracy|Democratic]] Decentralization, power is transferred to lower levels of government, public officials are elected by local citizens and are accountable to citizens rather than to the central government.
*[[Fiscal policy|Fiscal]] Decentralization involves assigning responsibilities for [[expenditures]] and [[revenue]]s to local governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.worldbank.org/publicsector/decentralization/fiscal.htm|title=Fiscal Decentralization|website=www1.worldbank.org|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of fiscal decentralization varies according to local governments' ability to raise revenues and the extent to which they are given autonomy in allocating their expenditures.

Countries differ in their degree of administrative, political and fiscal decentralization. For instance, in [[China]] there is a devolution of administrative and fiscal responsibilities but no political decentralization whereas it is the opposite in [[India]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bardhan|first=Pranab|last2=Mookherjee|first2=Dilip|date=2006|title=Decentralization, Corruption and Government Accountability: An Overview|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/bos/iedwpr/dp-152.html|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several theoretical arguments supporting that decentralization can improve governance and reduce corruption. To begin with, decentralization is believed to bring the government closer to its citizens and to improve the allocation of resources at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Azfar|first=O|last2=Kähkönen|first2=S|last3=Lanyi|first3=A|last4=Meagher|first4=P|last5=Rutherford|first5=Diana|date=2004-01-01|title=Decentralization, Governance and Public Services: The Impact of Institutional Arrangements|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230557423|journal=Devolution and Development: Governance Prospects in Decentralizing States|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The optimal output level of a local public good (at which citizens' [[Marginal utility|marginal benefit]] equals [[marginal cost]] of providing the good) varies across localities because of differences in preferences and costs. Considering that sub-national governments have better information about the preferences and circumstances of their constituencies, they can tailor the provision of public goods according to these preferences, thereby increasing efficiency and total welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oates|first=Wallace E|date=1999|title=An Essay on Fiscal Federalism|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|language=en|volume=37|issue=3|pages=1120–1149|doi=10.1257/jel.37.3.1120|issn=0022-0515|citeseerx=10.1.1.195.449}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea goes back to [[Friedrich Hayek|F. Hayek's]] argument in his essay "[[The Use of Knowledge in Society]]" (1945). Hayek asserts that since knowledge is decentralized ("the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayek|first=F. A.|date=1945|title=The Use of Knowledge in Society|jstor=1809376|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=35|issue=4|pages=519–530}}&lt;/ref&gt; it follows that decisions and control over resources should be decentralized (a necessary although not sufficient condition for achieving optimal allocation).

However, [[Principal–agent problem|principal-agent models]] demonstrate there can be tradeoffs in transferring [[decision-making]] responsibilities. Under these theoretical frameworks, central public officials are assumed to be public-spirited principals and local officials act as self-interested agents. On the one hand, [[public good]] delivery can be better adapted to local needs but on the other hand, the decisions are made by [[Principal–agent problem|agents]] whose interests differ from the [[Principal–agent problem|principal]]. Delegating [[authority]] can result in 'control loss' or 'abuse of power'. Decentralization can be more effective than centralized decision-making if the gains from adaptability can outweigh the control loss. The overall effects of decentralization on governance and [[welfare]] will therefore depend on the degree to which the principal's and agent's interests are opposed and the principal's ability to exert control over the agent's actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melumad|first=Nahum|last2=Mookherjee|first2=Dilip|last3=Reichelstein|first3=Stefan|date=1997-06-01|title=Contract Complexity, Incentives, and the Value of Delegation |journal=Journal of Economics &amp; Management Strategy|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=257–289|doi=10.1111/j.1430-9134.1997.00257.x|issn=1530-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that decentralization can enhance accountability in the service delivery mechanism. Local governments' proximity makes it more feasible for citizens to monitor and hold public officials accountable. The accountability mechanisms work through political decentralization. In a functional local democracy, local elections constitute an 'incomplete contract' enabling citizens to remove non-performing local officials from office.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, as Bardhan and Mookherjee argue, local democracy may not operate effectively in practice in developing countries and may be captured by local elites.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bardhan|first=Pranab|last2=Mookherjee|first2=Dilip|date=2000|title=Corruption and Decentralization of Infrastructure Delivery in Developing Countries|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/fth/bosecd/104.html|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, decentralization can reduce corruption by creating horizontal competition between local governments. [[Tiebout model|Tiebout]] make the case in a 1956 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiebout|first=Charles M.|date=1956-10-01|title=A Pure Theory of Local Expenditures|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=64|issue=5|pages=416–424|doi=10.1086/257839|issn=0022-3808}}&lt;/ref&gt; that residents' and factors of production's mobility across localities can reduce the monopoly power exercised by local public officials with respect to regulations and bribes. Fiscal and political decentralization encourages inter-jurisdictional competition that pressures sub-national governments to efficiently deliver local public goods. If citizens are dissatisfied with their local government's performance, they can move to other regions, thereby decreasing tax revenues in less efficient jurisdictions. A similar argument concerning the relationship between a decentralized bureaucratic structure and bribe payments has been explored in the academic literature. [[Susan Rose-Ackerman|Rose-Ackerman]] suggests that a decentralized civil service can reduce bribery since [[competition]] between public officials would bid down bribe payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RVa0BQAAQBAJ|title=Corruption: A Study in Political Economy|last=Rose-Ackerman|first=Susan|date=2013-10-22|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9781483289069|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vishny and Shleifer further develop this argument, they build a model where citizens and businesses require more than one service or good from several public officials. If government services are substitutes, then the competitive regime still applies. However, when government services are complementary and in the case of a decentralized bureaucratic structure, firms or citizens are facing several independent bureaucrats. Decentralization might therefore lead to a lack of coordination among bribe-seeking bureaucrats and a "[[Tragedy of the commons|Tragedy of the Commons]]" outcome where public officials ask bribe payments that are too high, thereby increasing the burden that corruption imposes on firms and citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shleifer|first=A.|last2=Vishny|first2=R. W.|date=1993-08-01|title=Corruption|url=https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/108/3/599/1881822?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=108|issue=3|pages=599–617|doi=10.2307/2118402|issn=0033-5533|jstor=2118402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diaby and Sylwester empirically test these hypotheses in a cross-country regression and find that bribe payments are higher under a more decentralized bureaucratic structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-09-01|title=Bureaucratic competition and public corruption: Evidence from transition countries|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268014000408|journal=European Journal of Political Economy|language=en|volume=35|pages=75–87|doi=10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2014.04.002|issn=0176-2680|last1=Diaby|first1=Aboubacar|last2=Sylwester|first2=Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Fisman and Gatti detect a strong negative correlation between fiscal decentralization (as measured by subnational share of total government spending) and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raymond|first=Fisman|last2=Roberta|first2=Gatti|date=2000|title=Decentralization and Corruption : Evidence across Countries|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/19852|journal=|language=en-US|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treisman (2000) examines correlations between eight different measures of decentralization with various measures of corruption and service delivery performance. The same measure of fiscal decentralization used by Fisman and Gatti appears not to be significantly correlated with corruption measures.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/seminar/2000|title=Decentralization and the Quality of Government|last=Treisman|first=Daniel|date=2000|website=www.imf.org|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decentralization is a complex process which manifests itself in various forms. The design and impetus for decentralization are specific to each country, which complicates comparisons of a single conception of decentralization. The literature on decentralization experiences in several developing countries suggests the effects of decentralization on public sector performance and corruption are likely to be ambiguous and highly context-specific.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The empirical work appears to be inconclusive as various types of decentralization were examined using different measures. What's more, measuring corruption as bribery without paying attention to special interest [[Elite capture|capture]] may provide an inaccurate assessment of the impact of decentralization. As Bardhan and Mookherjee argue, bribery may decrease while being replaced by local elite capture as a result of decentralization.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Treisman purports that the theoretical and empirical arguments about decentralization and governance refer to specific types of decentralization. He identifies five types: structural, decision, resource, electoral and institutional decentralization and develops arguments clarifying how each type affects the quality of government.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; While some types of decentralization can improve governance and reduce corruption, others can undermine government performance, this can in part explain the mixed empirical evidence on the effects of decentralization.

=== Top-Down Performance Monitoring ===
Rather than structuring rewards and penalties for corrupt behaviour, another approach to civil service reform seeks to increase the probability that corrupt activity will be observed. Theoretically,  monitoring can reduce [[Information asymmetry|information asymmetries]] so that the principal can induce the agent to choose the optimal level of effort and the optimal degree of corrupt activity. As the agent compares his expected payoff of being honest to that of being corrupt, increasing the probability of getting caught and punished will deter corrupt behaviour.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520074088|title=Controlling Corruption|last=Klitgaard|first=Robert|publisher=University of California Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=Chapter 3: Policy Measures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil service auditing by the principal or third parties serves an [[accountability]] function. The inherent conflict of interest as well as the lack of oversight require independent third parties to certify the reliability of financial reporting, performance results and compliance to rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://na.theiia.org/standards-guidance/leading-practices/Pages/the-role-of-auditing-in-public-sector-governance.aspx|title=The Role of Auditing in Public Sector Governance|last=|first=|date=|website=na.theiia.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auditors can help exercise oversight by evaluating the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the delivery of government services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/33Performanceauditing.pdf|title=Public Sector Performance Auditing in Developing Countries|last=Warring|first=Colleen|last2=Morgan|first2=Stephen|date=2009|website=|access-date=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[audit]]s must rely on efficiency measures and pre-determined criteria and benchmarks to assess public servant's performance and the impact of government's programs. Performance auditing can also help detect corruption in public entities. Audits highlight irregularities and areas of inefficiencies that may indicate the existence of corruption. Based on suspicious circumstances, auditors can identify illegal behaviour and collect evidence on misdeeds which can subsequently be used to prosecute public servants at fault. As previously mentioned, successful detection efforts by performance auditing can have a deterrent effect on corrupt activities.

Auditing and prosecution were important elements in Justice Plana's campaign to curb corruption in the Bureau of Internal Revenue in the Philippines. Appointed as the new Commissioner of the corrupt Bureau of Internal Revenue, Justice Plana's anti-corruption strategy focused on implementing a new performance evaluation system, gathering information on corruption through intelligence agents and audits and effectively prosecuting corrupt tax officers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; While Justice Plana's campaign was a multi-faceted approach, the higher monitoring intensity combined with a highly credible threat of punishment were particularly successful in deterring corrupt behaviour in the Bureau of Internal Revenue. According to Professor Magtolis-Briones, the threat of being detected and prosecuted decidedly lead officials to reconsider their decisions to engage in corrupt activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lynchlibrary.pssc.org.ph:8081/bitstream/handle/0/4711/07_Negative%20Bureaucratic%20Behavior%20and%20Development.pdf?sequence=1|title=Negative Bureaucratic Behaviour and Development:The Case of the Bureau of Internal Revenue|last=Magtolis-Briones|first=Leonor|date=1979|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Georgia, the success of anti-corruption reforms especially relied on top-down monitoring and prosecution but Schueth warns about the potential abuses of monitoring when fighting corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-03-01|title=Apparatus of capture: Fiscal state formation in the republic of Georgia|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629811001880|journal=Political Geography|language=en|volume=31|issue=3|pages=133–143|doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2011.11.004|issn=0962-6298|last1=Schueth|first1=Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crackdown on corruption in the tax agency involved coercion such as the use of extra-legal surveillance systems to ensure public officials' observance of the new procedural codes.

Laboratory experiments provide evidence on the impact monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-12-01|title=A controlled field experiment on corruption|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292111000389|journal=European Economic Review|language=en|volume=55|issue=8|pages=1072–1082|doi=10.1016/j.euroecorev.2011.04.007|issn=0014-2921|last1=Armantier|first1=Olivier|last2=Boly|first2=Amadou}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a controlled bribery experiment in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, Armantier and Boly observed that monitoring and punishment can be an effective anti-corruption policy. The researchers had two treatments, low monitoring and high monitoring.While the 'low monitoring' treatment proved effective in curbing bribery, they could not detect significant treatment effects on bribery in the 'high monitoring' treatment. The authors suggest that high monitoring intensity can crowd out intrinsic motivations to behave honestly.

Serra compare the effectiveness of top-down and bottom-up monitoring in a laboratory bribery game between public officials and private citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Serra|first=D.|date=2011-06-09|title=Combining Top-Down and Bottom-Up Accountability: Evidence from a Bribery Experiment|url=https://academic.oup.com/jleo/article-abstract/28/3/569/909949|journal=Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=569–587|doi=10.1093/jleo/ewr010|issn=8756-6222|citeseerx=10.1.1.594.1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experimental results suggest that top-down auditing is ineffective in deterring bribery, this may be especially true in weak institutional environments. However, the researcher found that combining formal top-down auditing and bottom-up monitoring created an accountability mechanism that was effective in curbing corruption.

=== Bottom-Up Monitoring and Reforms ===
An alternative approach to improving governance and combating corruption that has gained prominence in recent years is encouraging grassroots participation by community members in local monitoring to induce bottom-up pressures for reform. The 2004 World Development Report: Making Services Work for Poor People&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bank|first=The World|date=2003-09-30|title=World Development Report 2004 : Making services work for poor people - Overview|pages=1–36|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/527371468166770790/World-Development-Report-2004-Making-services-work-for-poor-people-Overview|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is centred on this grassroots approach to development. Community participation is now considered an important component of reforms aiming to improve public service delivery and corruption at the local level.&lt;ref name=":102"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Olken |first=Benjamin |title=Monitoring Corruption: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Indonesia |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=115 |issue=2 |year=2007 |pages=200–249 |doi=10.1086/517935 |citeseerx=10.1.1.144.6583 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bottom-up models of governance involve community members participating in the service provision process by allowing them to monitor public officials, to have a say in policymaking, and keep service providers accountable to incentivize them to deliver public goods and services efficiently.

[[Joseph Stiglitz|J. Stiglitz]] argues that community members, as beneficiaries of public goods and services, will have more incentives to monitor and ensure that governments programs are successful compared to indifferent central bureaucrats. In particular, project involving local citizens will be more likely to succeed since community participation helps sustain efforts towards the long-term continuation of projects necessary to keep them effective.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stiglitz|first=Joseph E.|date=2002|title=Participation and Development: Perspectives from the Comprehensive Development Paradigm|journal=Review of Development Economics|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=163–182|doi=10.1111/1467-9361.00148|issn=1363-6669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, [[Benjamin Olken|B. Olken]] contends that grassroots monitoring for public goods and services may be impaired by a free-rider problem&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt; and suggests that government provision of private goods (subsidized food or health care) may generate more incentives to monitor service provision as each community member has a personal interest in securing the effective delivery of goods and in minimizing extortion by public officials. Stiglitz indeed recognizes that grassroots monitoring of public good delivery is in itself a public good and that as such, it is under-provided.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

A bottom-up project, the Citizen Report Card (CRC), pioneered by the NGO [[Public Affairs Centre India|Public Affairs Center]] (PAC) was implemented in 1993 in [[Bangalore]], [[India]]. This project aimed at gathering local citizens' feedback on civil service performance and publicizing the results through the media, thereby exerting public pressures for the public service to improve its performance and launch reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adikeshavalu|first=Ravindra|date=2004-06-01|title=An assessment of the impact of Bangalore citizen report cards on the performance of public agencies|pages=1–25|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/777451468752769088/An-assessment-of-the-impact-of-Bangalore-citizen-report-cards-on-the-performance-of-public-agencies|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the report cards revealed low levels of citizens' satisfaction with service providers, and the expectation was that report cards would serve as an accountability mechanism that would bring forward issues of service provision quality and corruption levels in the public service. While this initiative did raise awareness on such issues, there was some but not dramatic improvement in service delivery quality between 1994 and 1999. However, the difficulty of measuring improvements in service quality other than through subjective measures restricts opportunities to rigorously evaluate this bottom-up initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/archive/website01004/WEB/IMAGES/10850832.PDF|title=Making Voices: The Report Card on Bangalore's Public Services|last=Paul|first=Samuel|date=|website=|publisher=Public Affairs Center, Bangalore, India|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Participatory budgeting|Participatory Budgeting]] in [[Porto Alegre]], [[Brazil]] is known among scholars and policymakers as an enduring example of bottom-up reforms.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Participatory-budgeting-of-Porto-Alegre:-a-in-the-Utzig/b8f09942a1c783728ff4a76e16a37deca2f11998|title=Participatory budgeting of Porto Alegre: a discussion in the light of the principle of democratic legitimacy and of the criterion of governance performance - Semantic Scholar|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participatory budgeting allows citizens to voice their demands regarding service delivery improvements, and through negotiations to influence budget funds allocation at the municipality level. This project was initiated in 1989, and is said to have improved access to and the quality of public service provision, especially for lower segments of society.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; For instance, 27,000 new public housing units were created in 1989 (compared to only 1,700 in 1986), the number of schools quadrupled between 1986 and 1997 while the share of Porto Alegre's budget going to education and health went from 13% in 1985 to about 40% in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEMPOWERMENT/Resources/14657_Partic-Budg-Brazil-web.pdf|title=Participatory Budgeting in Brazil|last=Bhatnagar et al.|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participatory budgeting still has to address some limitations, including lack of representation of the poorest, but its success has led other municipalities in Brazil and public entities in other countries to adopt this initiative.

== Evidence on Reform Effectiveness in Developing Countries ==

=== Pay Reforms Experiences ===

==== Base Salary Increases for Police Officers in Ghana ====
In 2010, the Ghanaian government implemented a civil service salary reform, the Single Spine Salary Structure (SSSS) to mitigate pay disparities in the public service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=D.|first=Larbi, M.|title=The Implementation of the Single Spine Salary Structure (Ssss) in Ghana|date=2007|degree=|publisher=University of Ghana|url=http://ugspace.ug.edu.gh/handle/123456789/8394|doi=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Police officer]]s were the first beneficiaries of this new salary structure as the police service has historically been the least well-paid of public services in [[Ghana]]. Their wages unilaterally doubled in an attempt to increase their [[Standard of living|living standards]] to reduce [[bribery]] (fair-wage hypothesis). Foltz and Opoku-Agyemang assess the impact of this salary reform using a [[Difference in differences|difference-in-difference]] analysis taking advantage of the exogenous change induced by the policy.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;

While police officers' wages doubled, the salaries of other civil servants in Ghana and police officers in [[Burkina Faso]] stayed the same. The researchers identified two groups, the Ghanaian policemen who received the treatment (higher wages) and the control group consisting of other civil servants (Ghanaian custom officers and Burkinabé policemen) whose wages did not increase.

Using data on bribes paid from 2,100 truck trips between Ghana and Burkina Faso,  Foltz and Opoku-Agyemang can observe the differences in interactions with truck drivers between the treated and the control group before the salary reform (2006-2010) and after the salary reform (2010-2012). If we assume group differences would have stayed constant in the absence of the reform ([[Difference in differences#Assumptions|parallel trend assumption]]), the difference-in-difference coefficient estimate measures the causal impact of the salary increase on Ghanaian police officers' propensity to ask for bribes. The results suggest that the salary reform counterintuively increased police officers' efforts to extort bribes, the value of the bribes and the total amount truck drivers had to pay on the road.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; This evidence goes against theoretical arguments on pay reforms in the civil service. Foltz and Opoku-Agyemang posit that these results could be due to the lack of enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Without changing the environment and other incentives facing civil servants, it appears that increasing wages may not have the predicted effects on corruption.

Corruption in tax administration has particularly detrimental effects on tax revenue collection, fiscal balance and overall economic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ajaz|first=Tahseen|last2=Ahmad|first2=Eatzaz|date=2010|title=The Effect of Corruption and Governance on Tax Revenues|jstor=41428665|journal=The Pakistan Development Review|volume=49|issue=4|pages=405–417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan, Khwaja and Olken implemented a large-scale randomized experiment in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]] to assess the impact of performance-based payment schemes for tax collectors.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Adnan Q. |last=Khan |first2=Asim I. |last2=Khwaja |first3=Benjamin A. |last3=Olken |year=2016 |title=Tax Farming Redux: Experimental Evidence on Performance Pay for Tax Collectors |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=131 |issue=1 |pages=219–271 |doi=10.1093/qje/qjv042 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/66265/1/Khan_Tax%20farming%20redux_2016.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with the Punjab provincial government, they randomly allocated tax officials in the provincial urban property tax department into four groups, a control group and three treatment groups corresponding to different pay-for-performance designs.

The three treatment groups differed in the degree to which tax officers' pay was based on revenue collection performance and on other subjective evaluations from taxpayers and the tax department. The 'Revenue' treatment provided incentives depending only on revenue collection exceeding a benchmark while the 'Revenue Plus' scheme tied salaries to tax collection performance as well as accuracy of tax assessment and taxpayers' satisfaction. The last treatment 'Flexible Plus' added several criteria set by the tax department to determine wages. After two fiscal years, Khan, Khwaja and Olken found that across the three treatment groups, tax revenues increased by 9 log points on average which is equivalent to 46% higher growth of revenues compared to the control group.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

The 'Revenue' scheme was the most effective in increasing tax collection but the researchers found no effects on accuracy of tax assessment or the satisfaction of taxpayers. They note that pay-for-performance schemes may have tradeoffs: giving excessive incentives to tax officers might increase their bargaining power with taxpayers and lead to more extortion and taxpayers' dissatisfaction. However, Khan, Khwaja and Olken point out that the benefits of pay-for-performance contracts outweigh their costs and suggest they can effective in increasing tax revenue collection.

=== Monitoring Reforms ===

==== Random Audits in Brazilian Municipalities ====
In 2003, the federal government of Brazil created the [[Comptroller General of Brazil|Controladoria Geral da União]] (CGU) charged with corruption prevention and internal control. The CGU launched an anti-corruption program, Programa de Fiscalização por Sorteios Públicos (Monitoring Program with Public Lotteries), which consists in randomly selecting municipalities for audits and publicly disseminating the findings. As of 2015, 12 years after the beginning of the reform, there have been 2,241 audits in 1,949 municipalities.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Avis |first=Eric |last2=Ferraz |first2=Claudio |last3=Finan |first3=Frederico |date=July 2016 |title=Do Government Audits Reduce Corruption? Estimating the Impacts of Exposing Corrupt Politicians |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 22443 |doi=10.3386/w22443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers Avis, Ferraz and Finan exploited the random selection to measure the impact of this anti-corruption program. While some municipalities had been audited several times in the past (treatment group), others were being audited for the first time (control group). Since the municipalities were randomly selected, comparing corruption levels among municipalities in the control and treatment group can provide causal estimates of the effects of the reform.

Based on audit reports, they estimate that 30% of the federal funds transferred to municipalities were stolen. However, they find that corruption levels were 8% lower in municipalities that had previously undergone government audits, thereby suggesting that random audits can be an effective policy against corruption. The researchers posit that random audits can reduce corruption by increasing public officials' perceived probability of being detected. They observed that audits also generated spillover effects, neighbouring municipalities were also affected, having an additional neighbour audited decreased their corruption levels by 7.5%.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The local media played a role in disseminating information about other municipalities' audit outcomes.

Avis et al. identify several mechanisms through which the audits led to lower local corruption. First, the new program introduce a system of political accountability whereby local citizens can punish or reward (dis)honest incumbents. Audits may have also altered the types of candidates who enter into politics. What's more, negative audit results can generate reputational costs and potential legal punishments.

==== Monitoring a Road Building Project in Indonesia ====
The Kecamatan Development Project (KDP) is an Indonesian government program, financed by the World Bank which funds village-level small-scale infrastructure programs. [[Benjamin Olken]] implemented a randomized experiment in which he randomly assigned 608 villages into groups with different audit probabilities prior to the start of a nationwide infrastructure project.&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt;

A random sample of villages were informed that the project would be audited by an audit agency once completed. This increased the probability of detection from 4% to 100%. The audit results were publicly disseminated by the auditors during village meetings. Olken also designed experiments to increase local members' participation in 'accountability meetings' where officials in charge of the road-building project expose how the budget will be spent.

To assess the impact of both monitoring mechanisms, the researcher uses a quantitative measure of corruption levels based on engineers' assessment of the quantity of materials used to build the roads and estimated costs. The discrepancies between project’s official costs reported by village project leaders and the costs estimated by independent engineers measures missing expenditures which are used as a proxy for corruption in Olken's study. It was estimated that on average 24% of materials were missing based on road samples, suggesting that part of the project funds were diverted. Olken finds that increasing the probability of external audits significantly reduced missing expenditures (by 8%), and that this approach to fighting corruption is cost-effective.&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt; Top-down audits were more effective when village elections were close, which implies that local level accountability can be effective in restraining corrupt behaviour. However, the interventions to increase grassroots participation did not have any significant effects on missing funds.

== Challenges and Barriers to Effective Civil Service Reforms ==
[[Political economy]] dynamics condition the success of civil service reforms. [[Douglass North|North]] et al. argue that some developing countries function as 'limited access orders' in which [[elite]]s exclude broad cross-sections of society to maintain an equilibrium that enables them to extracts rents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=North|first=Douglass C.|last2=Wallis|first2=John Joseph|last3=Webb|first3=Steven B.|last4=Weingast|first4=Barry R.|date=2007-11-09|title=Limited Access Orders In The Developing World :A New Approach To The Problems Of Development|journal=Policy Research Working Papers|language=en|doi=10.1596/1813-9450-4359|issn=1813-9450}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such an equilibrium, political elites have no incentives to break down their patronage networks and introduce [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]] recruitment reforms in the civil service as it would threaten their position and reduce their opportunities for [[rent-seeking]]. The [[Clientelism|clientelist]] system on the contrary can be a powerful mechanism through which elites maintain this 'limited access order'. Considerably depending on clientelist and [[patronage]] networks increases the costs of implementing public sector reforms. Elites will therefore be likely to oppose reforms as they stand to lose the most.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geddes|first=Barbara|date=1991|title=A Game Theoretic Model of Reform in Latin American Democracies|jstor=1963165|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=85|issue=2|pages=371–392|doi=10.2307/1963165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What's more, civil service reforms are costly to implement in the short-term while their benefits will be manifested and reaped in the future. Governments are thus unwilling to make such unappealing investment. The long-term nature of reforms and the reluctance to initiate, gather and maintain support for reforms prevent their implementation in the first place. In a background paper for the 2011 World Bank Development Report,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lant|first=Pritchett|last2=Frauke|first2=de Weijer|date=2011|title=Fragile States : Stuck in a Capability Trap?|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/9109|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; de Weijer and Pritchett appraise that it would take about 20 years to witness improvements in the functional capability of the state. In almost every countries, this exceeds the average duration of a term of office, political incumbents would have no incentives to incur the costs to carry out reforms while the benefits will accrue to future incumbents.

In addition, bureaucratic inertia and resistance to change should not be overlooked. Bureaucrats may be disinclined to accept changes brought by civil service reforms. This is especially true in countries where bureaucrats depend on informal or illegal channels to complement their meager salaries.&lt;ref name=":142"/&gt;

Institutional structures or types of political regimes also matter for reform implementation and success. In a democratic regime, political incumbents may see it in their interests to initiate bureaucratic reforms if voters value and acknowledge the public benefits of reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/corruption-and-government/domestic-conditions-for-reform/8B269276F411CD2BA57F1F87E534D02E|title=Domestic Conditions for Reform (Chapter 13) - Corruption and Government|website=Cambridge Core|language=en|access-date=2018-04-26|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, demand for civil service reforms remains weak in developing countries. Even if bureaucratic corruption is condemned across countries, the internal demand for anti-corruption reforms is undermined by a [[collective action problem]]. Indeed, Persson, Rohstein and Teorell argue that civil service reforms have failed as a result of their mischaracterization of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persson|first=Anna|last2=Rothstein|first2=Bo|last3=Teorell|first3=Jan|date=2012-09-07|title=Why Anticorruption Reforms Fail-Systemic Corruption as a Collective Action Problem|journal=Governance|language=en|volume=26|issue=3|pages=449–471|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01604.x|issn=0952-1895}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most approaches to civil service reform rely on principal-agent frameworks that assume that 'principled principals' are public-spirited and will always take on the task to fight corruption and improve bureaucratic performance. However, the authors contend that, in contexts where corruption is pervasive, actors will not necessarily respond to incentives aiming at altering their behaviour but instead behave based on the extent to which corruption is the expected behaviour in society.

'''Cognitive social structures''' ('''CSS''') is the focus of research that investigates how individuals perceive their own [[social structure]] (e.g. members of an organization, friend group, hierarchy, company employees, etc.). It is part of [[social network]] research and uses [[social network analysis]] to understand how various factors affect one’s cognitive representation of the network (i.e. the individual’s belief of who is connected to whom).  Importantly, an individual’s perception of the network may be different than reality. In fact, these differences between the perceived network and the actual network are the focus of many studies that seek insight into how we think about others and our relationships.&lt;ref name="Krackhardt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brands"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Krackhardt]] discussed the study of cognitive social structures in an article that defined the term and outlined its uses in social network research. [[Social structures]] are defined by a set of individual members and the relations between those members. The study of cognitive social structures also includes every member’s understanding of the social structure. Thus, a cognitive social structure consisting of ''n'' people has ''n'' separate, and possibly distinct, representations of that social structure.

Example: ''Alice, Bob, and Charlie are all friends. Thus, there are three separate representations of their network. If they each believe they are friends with the other two, but that the other two are not friends, then all three representations are distinct. That is, none of them agree on the structure of their friendship network.  If, on the other hand, they all believed they were all friends, then they would all have the same representation of the network.''

Furthermore, the perceived structure of the network and the actual structure of the network may be inconsistent.&lt;ref name="Krackhardt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brands"/&gt; By measuring every member’s perception of the network, researchers can analyze the systematic errors to understand how we think about networks and what affects these perceptions.

A network may consist of directed relations. A directed relation involves a sender and a receiver. For example, the relation “goes to for advice” is directed in that if Alice (sender) goes to Bob (receiver) for advice, it does not mean that Bob also goes to Alice for advice. The relation, "is a sibling of", on the other hand, is [[Symmetric relation|symmetric]], not directed, because if Alice is a sibling of Bob, then Bob is necessarily a sibling of Alice.

=== Terminology ===
* '''[[Broker]]''': A member who connects those who would otherwise be unconnected.
* '''[[Centrality]]''': Influence measured by number of connections and distance from others with high centrality
** '''[[Eigenvector centrality]]''': How well connected an individual is to other well-connected members
* '''[[Triadic closure|Closure]]/[[balance theory|Balance]]''': Given a member who is directly connected to two others, the triad is balanced if the other two are also connected
::''Alice is friends with Bob and Charlie. The triad is said to be balanced if Bob and Charlie are also friends. It is unbalanced if Bob and Charlie are not friends.''

* '''[[degree (graph theory)|Degree]]''': The number of direct connections
** '''In-degree''': The number of ties directed towards the person
** '''Out-degree''': The number of directed ties from the person to others
::''Alice goes to Bob and Charlie for advice. Bob goes to Alice for advice. Alice has in-degree 1, and out-degree 2.''

* '''[[distance (graph theory)|Geodesic Distance]]''': The shortest path between two individuals
::''Alice is friends with Bob who is friends with Charlie who is friends with David. The geodesic distance between Alice and Bob is one, between Alice and Charlie is two, and between Alice and David is three.''

* '''[[Homophily]]''': How similar an individual is to those directly connected to them
* '''[[Reciprocity (network science)|Reciprocity]]/Mutuality''': Given a directed relation from person A to person B, whether or not there is also a directed relation from person B to person A.
::''Alice goes to Bob for advice. This relationship is reciprocal if Bob also goes to Alice for advice.''

== Analyzing Cognitive Social Structures ==

=== Ego Network Analysis ===
An ego network, or a local structure, consists of the individual and every member who is directly connected to that individual. For example, on [[social media]], a user's ego network consists of the user (ego), everyone who is directly linked to that user's account (e.g. "friends" or "followers"), and the connections between those people (e.g. whether or not they are "friends" with or "followers" of each other). In an experiment, an ego network is measured by asking the participant to list everybody to whom they are directly connected, and then note which of those people are connected to each other. Thus, in an experimental setting, the ego network reflects the participant's view of their local network, and therefore may differ from another's participant's perspective.

=== Full Network Analysis ===
There are three primary methods used to examine a full cognitive social structure: slices (the individual perceptions of the full network), locally aggregated structures (the combination of each member’s direct connections), and consensus structures (the network of relations that more than a certain portion of members agree on).&lt;ref name="Krackhardt"/&gt;

==== Slices&lt;ref name="Krackhardt"/&gt; ====
One way to analyze a cognitive social structure is to individually look at each “slice”, that is, each member’s perception. Biases in network perception may shift based on the individual (e.g. personality) or the position (e.g. popular, low status). Comparing slices reveals differences between individuals as well as systematic errors in perception across members.

==== Locally Aggregated Structures (LAS)&lt;ref name="Krackhardt"/&gt; ====
One approach to studying a cognitive social structure is to measure each member’s direct connections (ego networks). In other words, ask each individual to report who they are related to (e.g. friends with) in the network. That is, consider the individual’s own relationships. Then connect all of these local networks to form the whole network. Building a network model in this way can be achieved by asking individuals who they relate to (e.g. “Who do you go to for advice?”), known as a Row Dominated Locally Aggregated Structure, or who is related to them (e.g. “Who goes to you for advice?”), known as a Column Dominated Locally Aggregated Structure.

There are two ways to combine local structures into the full locally aggregated structure. Taking the intersection of the local networks results in a network in which relations exist if both members perceive it. In a friendship network, this means that a friendship only exists if both people consider the other a friend. The union of the local networks is a structure consisting of relations that at least one involved member perceives. In a friendship network, this is equivalent to saying a friendship exists between two people if at least one of them considers the other a friend.

==== Consensus Structures&lt;ref name="Krackhardt"/&gt; ====
The consensus structure of a cognitive social structure is the network that more than a certain number of people perceive. This is accomplished by fixing a threshold such that a relation is said to exist if and only if the proportion of members who perceive that relation is greater than the threshold. For example, setting the threshold to 0.5 means that the relation between two people exists if the majority of people believe it exists. Similarly, a relation between two people does not exist if a majority of people do not perceive it.

== Empirical Findings ==
Many species are able to represent social structures, yet humans are able to represent disproportionately large social structures (based on cortical thickness in the brain).&lt;ref name="Brashears"&gt;{{cite journal

|doi=10.1038/srep01513
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Research suggests that this is, at least in part, due to the use of [[schema (psychology)|schema]]s.&lt;ref name="Krackhardt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kilduff"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Schemas are a pre-established method of organizing and perceiving the world. Similar to a template, schemas provide a basic scaffolding that allow humans to make assumptions about a social structure without remembering every detail individually. This preserves neural resources, allowing for representation of larger structures.&lt;ref name="Brashears"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kilduff"/&gt; Some research suggests that a basic schema people utilize is based on [[small-world network]] properties.&lt;ref name="Kilduff"/&gt; Namely, one tends to believe that their social network contains groups of people who are highly intraconnected, and that these groups, or clusters, are connected via short paths.&lt;ref name="Kilduff"/&gt; Other work suggests that this is particularly true of one's own group, but not for others.&lt;ref name="Kumbasar"/&gt; For example, Alice likely believes that all of her friends are friends with each other, but other groups are not as connected.

In addition to making network representation efficient, schemas, as well as other biases, lead to systematic errors in network perception. These errors in individual and group perceptions has been the focus of much of the research related to cognitive social structures.

In research, a typical method of measuring cognitive social structures involves 
:(a) listing one’s direct ties, either in general or in terms of whom they’ve interacted with recently, or 
:(b) completing a table that lists all members in the rows and columns by checking off whom everyone is connected to.

=== Learning Networks ===

Specific factors have been shown to influence how easily and how well people are able to learn new networks.&lt;ref name="Karuza"&gt;{{cite journal

|issue=8
|pages=629–640
|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2016.06.003
}}&lt;/ref&gt; As discussed above, people use schemas to represent networks. It makes sense, therefore, that structures that are consistent with these schemas are easier to learn.&lt;ref name="Janicik"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Specifically, behavioral research suggests that individuals are better at learning networks that group members by positive relations (e.g. "liking") and divide groups by negative relations (e.g. "disliking"),&lt;ref name="DeSoto1968"&gt;{{cite journal

|volume=64
|issue=4
|pages=303–307
|doi=10.1037/h0044867
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and larger networks are easier to remember if they are balanced (if one person is friends with two others, than those two are also friends).&lt;ref name="Brashears"/&gt; People are also better at remembering large networks if they include kin labels (e.g. "Mother", "Uncle", "Cousin", etc.) than if they do not.&lt;ref name="Brashears"/&gt;

=== Accuracy ===
Many researchers compare individuals’ cognitive social structures to the actual social structure in order to measure consistent errors, or biases, involved with cognitive social structures. While some research shows that individuals’ representations correlate with the aggregate group’s representation,&lt;ref name="Kumbasar"&gt;{{cite journal
|last1=Kumbasar|first1=Ece
|last2=Rommey|first2=A. Kimball
|last3=Batchelder|first3=William H.

|journal=American Journal of Sociology
|volume=100
|issue=2
|pages=477–505
|doi=10.1086/230544
}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are systematic errors that occur as a result of network position and individual differences.&lt;ref name="Brands"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumbasar"/&gt;

Many researchers have studied the effects of and the perceptions of centrality , or how well connected one is within the network. Broadly, individuals tend to believe they have higher centrality (i.e. better connected within the network) and higher degree (e.g. more friends) than others believe.&lt;ref name="Kumbasar"/&gt; Furthermore, members who have low centrality, such as those who are on the periphery of the network or at the bottom of the hierarchy (unpopular, low status), tend to have more accurate representations than those who are more central (popular, high status).&lt;ref name="Simpson2011b"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies suggest that social network representations track overall patterns of behavior, rather than specific events.&lt;ref name="Killworth"&gt;{{cite journal
|last1=Killwroth|first1=Peter
|last2=Bernard|first2=H.
|title=Informant accuracy in social network data

|pages=269–286
|doi=10.17730/humo.35.3.10215j2m359266n2
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there appears to be a trade-off between overall accuracy and specific event accuracy: those who remember details of a specific interaction tend to have less accurate representations of overall behavior patterns, while those with more accurate pattern representations have more trouble recalling event details.&lt;ref name="FreemanEtAl"&gt;{{cite journal
|last1=Freeman|first1=Linton C.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This can cause issues when studying cognitive social structures because, often, the only way to determine the true social network is by observing behavior. If, however, the researchers do not sufficiently observe the network, then the observed behavior may not be representative of the overall patterns of behavior. Some research suggests that people extract these patterns of behavior by tracking the frequency of interactions, assuming that the more frequently two people interact, the more likely they are connected.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt; This leads to the belief that people are more connected than they actually are.&lt;ref name="FreemanWebster"&gt;{{cite journal

That is, when participants see a network member's face, they automatically retrieve information about that person's network position, suggesting that this information is important in understanding that person.&lt;ref name="SpontaneousEncoding"/&gt;

Much of the research relating social networks to neural measures focuses on physical size and density of brain regions. Research shows that social network size correlates with brain volume in specific regions, including the amygdala&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bickart|first1=Kevin C|last2=Wright|first2=Christopher I|last3=Dautoff|first3=Rebecca J|last4=Dickerson|first4=Bradford C|last5=Barrett|first5=Lisa Feldman|title=Amygdala volume and social network size in humans|journal=Nature Neuroscience|date=26 December 2010|volume=14|issue=2|pages=163–164|doi=10.1038/nn.2724|pmc=3079404}}&lt;/ref&gt; and regions associated with the [[default mode network]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kanai|first1=R.|last2=Bahrami|first2=B.|last3=Roylance|first3=R.|last4=Rees|first4=G.|title=Online social network size is reflected in human brain structure|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=19 October 2011|volume=279|issue=1732|pages=1327–1334|doi=10.1098/rspb.2011.1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Penelope A.|last2=Rezaie|first2=Roozbeh|last3=Brown|first3=Rachel|last4=Roberts|first4=Neil|last5=Dunbar|first5=R.I.M.|title=Ventromedial prefrontal volume predicts understanding of others and social network size|journal=NeuroImage|date=August 2011|volume=57|issue=4|pages=1624–1629|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.05.030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Von Der Heide|first1=Rebecca|last2=Vyas|first2=Govinda|last3=Olson|first3=Ingrid R.|title=The social network-network: size is predicted by brain structure and function in the amygdala and paralimbic regions|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|date=December 2014|volume=9|issue=12|pages=1962–1972|doi=10.1093/scan/nsu009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powell|first1=J.|last2=Lewis|first2=P.

=== Individual Differences ===
Studies on [[individual differences]] in cognitive social structures examine how individuals' traits affect their perceptions of social networks. Following are specific aspects of individuals that researchers have found influence cognitive social structures.

'''[[Need for closure]]''',&lt;ref name="NFC"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to one's tendency to avoid ambiguity, has been shown to correlate with the number of ties that are perceived as transitive.&lt;ref name="Flynn2010"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the higher one's need for closure, the more likely they are to perceive unbalanced groups as balanced. Additionally, people with high need for closure tend to cluster people by racial similarity in their representation of social networks.&lt;ref name="Flynn2010"/&gt;

'''Status, Power, Popularity''': in real-world social networks, low-power members tend to have more accurate perceptions of social networks than high-power individuals, particularly regarding people who are distant to the perceiver.&lt;ref name="SimpsonBorch"/&gt; One study found that these low-power individuals with accurate network perceptions received more payoffs compared to other low-power members with less accurate perceptions.&lt;ref name="Simpson2011a"&gt;

|pages=172–176
|doi=10.1016/j.socnet.2010.10.008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the benefits to low-status individuals with accurate network knowledge only held if other low-status people had worse knowledge.&lt;ref name="Simpson2011a"/&gt; Similarly, in a controlled setting, participants [[Priming (psychology)|primed]] with low-status then had more accurate representations of a social network, but not of a non-social network.&lt;ref name="Simpson2011b"/&gt; This research suggests that one's own status is an important factor in their representation of their social networks, because high power prompts people to use [[heuristics]], while low-power people use more systematic methods to understand the network.&lt;ref name="Simpson2011b" /&gt;

There has been lots of research on how people perceive their social network and the differences between these perceptions. Other individual differences measures have been suggested to influence cognitive social structures, including [[need for achievement]], [[need for affiliation]], and [[self-monitoring]].&lt;ref name="Casciaro"&gt;

However, since studies often use different types of networks (e.g. real-world organizations, friend groups, communication networks), there is not yet consensus on the effect of these differences.

{{Wiktionarypar|contestant}}

A '''contestant''' is someone who takes part in a [[competition]], usually a [[professional]] competition or a [[game show]] on [[television]]. The participants competing against each other have to go through rounds. The [[wikt:winner|winner]]s may have to compete in later stages or rounds until there is just one winner.

==Game show contestants==
Game show contestants are usually members of the [[general public]] who are selected via some sort of qualification system, such as a [[general knowledge]] or [[IQ test]] (an example of this is ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', in which contestants must pass a 50-question test) who then appear on the televised show. Game show careers are usually short-lived, perhaps lasting only one day. A very small minority go on to achieve national fame, such as [[Joyce Brothers]] and [[Ken Jennings]] in the [[United States]] and [[Charles Ingram]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

Some game shows deliberately target [[celebrity]] contestants, such as ''[[Match Game]]'' and ''[[Blankety Blank]]''.

There are links between game show contestants and other games and hobbies, such as [[Scrabble]] players who take part in word-based game shows like ''[[Countdown (game show)|Countdown]]'' and ''[[BrainTeaser]]''.

==Reality TV contestants==
Reality TV contestants are also selected from the general public, but again celebrity versions do exist. Shows like ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'' select contestants from the general public by examining video logs that the contestants send in to the show. A small number, perhaps 10 or 15, are selected to live in a confined house separated from the outside world.

In general, reality TV contestants are set some task to do or achieve in a selected place, such as an isolated house or desert island, and are filmed for long periods of the day. In the case of ''Big Brother'', they are filmed up to 24 hours a day.

'''Copwatch''' (also '''Cop Watch''') is a network of [[activist]] organizations, typically autonomous and focused in local areas, in the United States and Canada (and to a lesser extent Europe) that observe and document police activity while looking for signs of [[police misconduct]] and [[police brutality]]. They believe that monitoring police activity on the streets is a way to prevent police brutality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Visual Culture Reader, 2nd edition |chapter= |editor= |author=Nicholas Mirzoeff |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=0-415-25222-9 |page=390 |pages= |url= |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stated goal of at least one Copwatch group is to engage in monitoring and videotaping police activity in the interest of holding the police accountable in the events involving assaults or police misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Surveillance and Security: Technological Politics and Power in Everyday Life|author=Torin Monahan|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-415-95393-1|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copwatch was first started in [[Berkeley, California]] in 1990.&lt;ref name="Chermak07"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Shelley L. |last1=Schlief |chapter=The Rodney King Beating Trial: A Landmark for Reform |pages=139–60 [[{{Google books|UNex7XqLuiIC|page=157|plainurl=yes}} 157]] |chapterurl={{Google books|UNex7XqLuiIC|page=139|plainurl=yes}} |year=2007 |editor1-first=Steven M. |editor1-last=Chermak |editor2-first=Frankie Y. |editor2-last=Bailey |title=Crimes and Trials of the Century: From the Black Sox scandal to the Attica prison riots |volume=2 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-313-34110-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copwatch methods==
The main function of most Copwatch groups is monitoring police activity. "Copwatchers" go out on foot or driving patrols in their communities and record interactions between the police and civilians. Copwatchers hope that monitoring police activity will provide a deterrent against police misconduct. Some groups also patrol at [[protest]]s and [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] to ensure that police do not violate the rights of protesters. One Copwatch organization states that it has a policy of non-interference with the police, although this may not be true for all groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phoenixcopwatch.org/about.html |title=About Phoenix Copwatch |publisher=Phoenix Copwatch |accessdate=2008-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907125425/http://www.phoenixcopwatch.org/about.html |archivedate=September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Phoenix, Arizona]], copwatchers have increased efforts of "reverse surveillance" on the police in an effort to document [[racial profiling]].&lt;ref name="CNNPhoenix"/&gt; They believe that [[Arizona Senate Bill 1070]], a controversial law that allows police to question people they believe are illegal immigrants, will increase racial profiling by police.&lt;ref name="CNNPhoenix"&gt;{{cite news |author = Emanuella Grinberg|url= http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/05/11/phoenix.copwatch.arpaio/index.html?hpt=C1|title=Cop-watchers look for racial profiling on the streets of Phoenix | publisher= CNN|date= May 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copwatch groups also hold "Know Your Rights" forums to educate the public about their legal and [[human rights]] when interacting with the police, and some groups organize events to highlight problems of [[police abuse]] in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Michelle Chen|url=http://newstandardnews.net/content/index.cfm/items/1507|title='Copwatch' Activists Patrol Communities to Thwart Police Misconduct|publisher=The New Standard|year=2005|accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response to the killing of Kendra James==
In 2003, [[Kendra James]] was fatally shot by [[Portland, Oregon]] Officer Scott McCollister as she attempted to drive away from a traffic stop with Officer McCollister attempting to pull her out of the vehicle. After the shooting Copwatch offered a reward for a photograph of McCollister. It then produced and distributed posters bearing McCollister's photo and the phrase "Getting away with murder".

The editorial staff of [[Willamette Week]] opined that the poster was "inflamed rhetoric" which would harm "the relationship between the Portland police and the community it serves", and claimed that protest posters put up by the Rose City chapter of Copwatch were aimed at "inciting generalized anti-cop hysteria at the expense of informed criticism".&lt;ref name="WW"&gt;{{cite web|last1=WW Editorial Staff|title=Portland's crazed leftists / Arissa / Rose City Copwatch|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-3106-portlands-crazed-leftists-arissa-rose-city-copwatch.html|website=Willamette Week|publisher=Willamette Week|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==William Cardenas video==
[[File:Cardenas-YouTube.jpg|right|200px|thumb| November 3, 2006: Video showing an LAPD officer striking William Cardenas 6 times in the face as he struggles to prevent the officers from handcuffing him.]] 
On November 3, 2006, CopWatch [[Los Angeles, California|LA]] posted a video showing the arrest of William Cardenas, whom police described as "a known gang member who had been wanted on a felony warrant for receiving stolen property". According to the arrest report, when officers tried to arrest Cardenas as he was drinking beer on the sidewalk with two others, he fled, but was caught and tripped by the officers, who then began to attempt to handcuff Cardenas as he fought with the officers to avoid being arrested.

The video, in which Cardenas struggles to prevent the police from handcuffing him, shows an officer repeatedly punching him in the face while trying to force his hands together. The officers indicated that they were unable to subdue Cardenas with pepper spray, which seemed to have "little effect", and that some of the punches were delivered in response to Cardenas putting his hand on one officer's gun holster during the struggle. According to the arrest report, several witnesses confirmed that Cardenas threw punches at the officers, who were only able to handcuff him after two of his friends arrived and told him to stop fighting.&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite news|title=Alleged LAPD Brutality Video Sparks Probe|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/11/09/national/main2170342.shtml|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=2006-11-10 | date=2006-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Video, arrest report at odds|author=Richard Winton |author2=Patrick McGreevy |author3=Andrew Blankstein|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1160385141.html?dids=1160385141:1160385141&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Nov+11%2C+2006&amp;author=Richard+Winton%2C+Patrick+McGreevy+and+Andrew+Blankstein&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.1&amp;desc=THE+STATE%3B+Video%2C+arrest+report+at+odds%3B+An+LAPD+officer+says+he+punched+William+Cardenas+twice.+A+tape+that+aired+on+YouTube+shows+at+least+six+blows. |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2006-11-11 | date=2006-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circulation of this video led to nationwide media coverage of Copwatch, and, although the LAPD had begun a use-of-force investigation the same day as the arrest, prompted an additional investigation into police conduct by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=YouTube.com Video Prompts Probe of LAPD|last=Veiga|first=Alex|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2006-11-13-youtube-arrest_x.htm|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=2006-11-13 | date=2006-11-13|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Superior Court]] commissioner had previously concluded that the use of force was reasonable because Cardenas was resisting arrest.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt;

==Awards==
In 2013 Berkeley Copwatch was awarded the [[James Madison Freedom of Information Award]] by the [[Society of Professional Journalists]], Northern California chapter, for "effective use of public records to block a Homeland Security grant for putting an armored military vehicle on the streets of Albany and Berkeley."&lt;ref name="BDP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Berkeleyans Receive Awards from Society of Professional Journalists|url=http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2013-02-08/article/40755?headline=Berkeleyans-Receive-Awards-from-Society-of-Professional-Journalists--|website=www.berkeleydailyplanet.com|publisher=Michael O'Malley|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Joe Arpaio]], the [[Maricopa County Sheriff's Office controversies#Joe Arpaio|controversial]] Sheriff of [[Maricopa County]], [[Arizona]], has said that his opponents' videotaping of police during traffic stops "create safety concerns for his deputies."&lt;ref name="ABC15.com"&gt;{{cite news|author=ABC15.com|title=Nearly 70 arrested during Arpaio's West Valley crime sweeps | url=http://www.abc15.com/content/news/westvalley/surprise/story/Nearly-70-arrested-during-Arpaio-s-West-Valley/IVjY5KNxnEWn-CkwFVE15Q.cspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021083210/http://www.abc15.com/content/news/westvalley/surprise/story/Nearly-70-arrested-during-Arpaio-s-West-Valley/IVjY5KNxnEWn-CkwFVE15Q.cspx|archivedate=October 21, 2009|date=October 20, 2009|accessdate=October 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Dees, former police officer and editor-in-chief of Officer.com, alleges that Copwatch selectively distributes video and photographic media to "spin" incidents against law enforcement.&lt;ref name=officer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officer.com/interactive/2006/11/17/copwatch/ |title=Cop Watch|author=Tim Dees|publisher=officer.com |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080614191025/http://www.officer.com/interactive/2006/11/17/copwatch/ |archivedate = 2008-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7902">'''Culture &amp; Social Cognition''' is the relationship between human culture and human [[cognitive]] capabilities.  Cultural cognitive [[evolution]] proposes that humans’ unique cognitive capacities are not solely due to biological inheritance, but are in fact due in large part to cultural transmission and evolution (Tomasello, 1999). Modern humans and [[great apes]] are separated evolutionarily by about six million years. Proponents of cultural evolution argue that this would not have been enough time for humans to develop the advanced cognitive capabilities required to create tools, language, and build societies through biological evolution. Biological evolution could not have individually produced each of these cognitive capabilities within that period of time. Instead, humans must have evolved the capacity to learn through cultural transmission (Tomasello, 1999). This provides a more plausible explanation that would fit within the given time frame. Instead of having to biologically account for each cognitive mechanism that distinguishes modern humans from previous relatives, one would only have to account for one significant biological adaptation for cultural learning. According to this view, the ability to learn through cultural transmission is what distinguishes humans from other primates (Tomasello, 1999). Cultural learning allows humans to build on existing knowledge and make collective advancements, also known as the “[[ratchet effect]]”. The ratchet effect simply refers to the way in which humans continuously add on to existing knowledge through modifications and improvements.  This unique ability distinguishes humans from related primates, who do not seem to build collaborative knowledge over time. Instead, primates seem to build individual knowledge, in which the expertise of one animal is not built on by others, and does not progress across time.

==Cultural learning==
Human cultural learning involves:
* Imitation- the ability to learn by observing others
* Instruction- the ability to learn through direct instruction
* Collaboration- the ability to learn in cooperation with other individuals
Cultural learning is made possible by a deep understanding of social cognition. Humans have the unique capacity to identify and relate to others and view them as intentional beings. Humans are able to understand that others have intentions, goals, desires, and beliefs. It is this deep understanding, this cognitive adaptation, that allows humans to learn from and with others through cultural transmission (Tomasello, 1999).

==Social Cognition in Mammals and Primates==
Primates show distinct characteristics of social cognition in comparison to mammals. Mammals are able to identify members of their species, understand basic kinships and basic social hierarchies, make predictions about others’ behavior based on emotion and movement, and engage in social learning (Tomasello, 1999).  Primates, however, show a more extensive understanding of these concepts. Primates not only understand kinship and social hierarchies, but they also have an understanding of relational categories. That is, primates are able to understand social relations that extend beyond their individual interaction with others. Mammals are able to form direct relationships based on social hierarchies, but primates have an understanding of social hierarchies and relationships that extend beyond them personally. Researchers believe that this understanding of relational categories might have been the evolutionary precursor to humans’ deeper understanding of desires, beliefs, and goals underlying causal relationships, and thereby allowing humans to relate to and understand other individuals, making way for cultural evolution (Tomasello, 1999).

Although it is now believed that non-human primates such as chimpanzees have some limited understanding of others as intentional beings, it is clear that these understanding are not as deep as human understanding of others as intentional agents.  Chimpanzees, for example, demonstrated an ability to think about what others see, and predict behavior based on these beliefs in several studies conducted by Tomasello and Hare (2003). For example, subordinate chimpanzees in one experiment avoided food that they knew the dominant chimpanzee could see, but sought food that the dominant chimpanzee could not see due to a physical barrier. In another experiment, subordinate chimpanzees made decisions about approaching food based on whether or not the dominant chimpanzee had seen the human researcher place the food behind the barrier. Chimpanzees were also found to react differently to humans who were unwilling versus unable to provide food (teasing the chimpanzee with food, or pretending to have an accident with it), thereby showing some ability to discriminate intentionality.

Dogs have also shown some interesting but limited abilities at social cognition in a series of studies by Hare and Tomasello (2005). Dogs have the ability to read human social cues, even to a greater extent than chimpanzees. Dogs are able to respond to human pointing, the human gaze, and subtle human nods without training. Researchers now believe that these abilities are the result of convergent evolution between humans and dogs through domestication. Research with domesticated foxes has shown that the likely mechanism for this convergent evolution was the selection of tame behavior in dogs. This finding suggests that perhaps humans had to evolve a propensity to cooperate before cultural evolution was able to take place (Hare &amp; Tomasello, 2005).

==Sociogenesis &amp; Human Ontogeny==
Sociogenesis refers to collaborative inventiveness. It is the process by which two or more humans collectively interact and invent something new which could not have been developed by one individual alone, such as language and mathematics (Tomasello, 1999). Sociogenesis can occur across time, or simultaneously (Tomasello, 1999).  Socigenesis across times occurs through the ratchet effect, when one individual modifies something they had previously learned through others. Over time, ideas, tools, and language advance. Simultaneous sociogenesis occurs when two or more individuals work together at the same time and develop something new.

In response to the nature versus nurture and learned versus innate debate, proponents of cultural evolution argue that cognitive psychology must take into account historical processes when studying and discussion cognition (Tomasello, 1999). For example, the similarities between languages have led many researchers to decry that language or aspects of language must be innate. The extreme variability in math and counting systems across cultures has prevented similar conclusions for math. However, Tomasello argues that if you look at these concepts with historical processes in mind, another plausible explanation could be that language, but not math, developed before people split into different populations. Math developed only after such split, and because the cultural needs of these people differed, differential counting and mathematical systems resulted. The critique is that categorizing concepts as innate or learned does not tell us anything about the process by which they originally developed.

The '''dematerialization''' of a product literally means less, or better yet, no material is used to deliver the same level of functionality to the user. Sharing, borrowing and the organization of group services that facilitate and cater for communities needs could alleviate the requirement of [[ownership]] of many products.

In his book ‘'In the Bubble: designing in a complex world'’, John Thakara states that "the average consumer power tool is used for ten minutes in its entire life - but it takes hundreds of times its own weight to [[manufacture]] such an object”. A [[product service system]] with shared tools could simply offer access to them when needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In the Bubble: Designing in a Complex World

Digital music distribution systems, car clubs, bike hire schemes and laundry services are all examples of dematerialization.

[[Sergei Eisenstein]] was briefly associated with the movement. 
== Eccentrism in theatre == 
In [[Russian language|Russian]], the word “eccentric” was used as a [[term of art]] for circus performers, referring to the tricks performed for the audience. In 1921 the young directors Grigory Kozintsev, Leonid Trauberg, Sergi Yutkevich, and Gregory Kryzhitsky formed the theatre workshop “factory of the eccentric actor” (Fabrika Ekstsentricheskogo Aktera, or FEKS), in [[Petrograd]]. It was one of a plethora of avant-garde artists groupings blossoming in this period which attempted to respond to the faster paces of modernity within the openings perceived after the 1917 revolution. FEKS in particular advocated “an illogical performance style modeled on the physicality of circus stunts,” as well as on the popularity of American cinema of the period, such as Charlie Chaplin.&lt;ref name="Nieland"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nieland|first1=Justus|title=Feeling Modern: The Eccentrisities of Public Life|date=2008|publisher=University of Illinois Press}} page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The December 1921 manifesto of the eccentric theater “Ekstsentrism” pronounced: “1) for the actor—from emotion to the machine, from anguish to the trick. The technique—circus…. 2) for the director—a maximum of devices, a record number of inventions, a turbine of rhythms.  3) for the dramatist—a composer of tricks. 4) for the artist—decoration in jumps.”&lt;ref&gt;Grigory Kozintsev, Leonid Trauberg, Sergi Yutkevich, and Gregory Kryzhitsky, "Ekstsentrism," 1922, reprinted in {{cite book|editor1-last=Taylor|editor1-first=Richard|editor2-last=Christie|editor2-first=Ian|title=The Film Factory: Russian and Soviet Cinema in Documents 1896-1939|date=1988|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; In true Futurist fashion the manifesto demanded the abandonment of the old culture, and was handed out on the streets of St. Petersburg. 

In ''New Worlds, Russian Art and Society'', David Elliott states that “Eccentricism was a logical development from the alogical thought of the futurists. Artists introduced absurd elements or breaks in logic into their work in order to restructure and reorientate reality.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elliot|first1=David|title=New Worlds, Russian Art and Society 1900-1937|date=1986|publisher=Rizzoli|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1922 the main participants in FEKS expanded on the Eccentrist manifesto, and cited as parents of the movement, street language, circus posters, negro jazz bands, cinema, the music hall, the circus and boxing. Key to eccentrism in action was “synthesis of movements: acrobatic, gymnastic, balletic, constructivist-mechanical,” to give “the BASIC TEMPO of the epoch.”&lt;ref name ="TaylorandChristie"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Taylor|editor1-first=Richard|editor2-last=Christie|editor2-first=Ian|title=The Film Factory: Russian and Soviet Cinema in Documents 1896-1939|date=1988|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not till September 1922 that FEKS put on its first public performance, based loosely on Nikolai Gogol’s ''Wedlock'', but titled “Wedlock (Not from Gogol): A Stunt in Three Acts.”&lt;ref name ="SenekickandOstrovsky"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Senekick|editor1-first=Laurence|editor2-last=Ostrovsky|editor2-first=Sergei|title=The Soviet Theatre: A Documentary History|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Playbill promised “Eccentrism presents: operetta, melodrama, farce, movies, circuses, variety, puppetry in a single performance!” According to contemporary reviews, the two main characters, scientists Albert and Einstein, “were played by circus eccentrics Serge and Taurek”, to “the utter delight of the audience.” “Eccentrism was the principle of organization of the entire spectacle,” with the actors joined by a dancer and a crowd of marchers.&lt;ref name="SenekickandOstrovsky" /&gt;

In “The Future of FEKS” of 1923, Sergy Radlov announced that, from this season, “FEKS will carry on work as an independent studio within the Petroproketkul’t” &lt;ref&gt;Sergy Radlov, “The Future of FEKS” ''Teatr'' 3 (1923), cited in Senekick and Ostrovsky (eds.), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; the Petrograd manifestation of the new Soviet Proletkult federation dedicated to revolutionary working class aesthetic production. It was in this form that the group produced the Cocteau-influenced "Foreign Trade on the Eiffel Tower" (1923). By then, the group included well-known theatrical figures such as, SG Martinson, FF Knorre, as well as the dancer and silent film actress Z. Tarkhovskaya. 

Despite the stated links with the circus, a sympathetic critic, Vladimir Nedobrovo, wrote in 1928 that “the Eccentrism of the FEKS is not the same as the eccentrism of the music hall” and is concerned with opening up stilted perception through “impeded form” and “alienation of the object” from its automatic state, a vision which owed something to Russian Formalist poetics.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Richard|title=The Politics of the Soviet Cinema, 1917-1929|date=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521088558}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yutkevich went further, and claimed its “aim was the final destruction of the bourgeois world.”&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;

The young Sergi Eisenstein (then associated with the more mechanized aesthetic of Meyerhold’s acting workshop) was introduced to FEKS by Sergi Yutkevich in 1922. He was strongly under its influence when he produced his first major work for the theater, “The Montage of Attractions” (1923), and worked with Tretiakov on “The Wiseman,” shown in the Moscow Proletkult Theatre in 1923.&lt;ref name="Nieland" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elliot|first1=David|title=New Worlds, Russian Art and Society 1900-1937|date=1986|publisher=Rizzoli|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; While FEKS cited Chaplin’s cinema as an influence on their theater, and Eisenstein was influenced by FEKS theater in his later films, both took pains to distinguish the methods of fiction film from those of theater, unlike Meyerhold who moved to merge their styles. Viktor Shklovsky wrote of the impossible, unexpected, and “eccentric” effects in Eisenstein’s 1925 film, Strike.&lt;ref&gt;Shklovsky, Viktor, "Strike" (1922) in{{cite book|editor1-last=Christie|editor1-first=Ian|editor2-last=Gillett|editor2-first=John|title=Futurism / Formalism / FEKS: Eccentrism and Soviet Cinema, 1918-36|date=1978|publisher=British Film Institute|page=31-35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eccentrism in film == 

Out of the FEKS theater, a new film-making group was being formed.&lt;ref name="TaylorandChristie" /&gt; They were concerned not just with “the selection of memorial moments” in the words of contemporary Russian Formalist critic Viktor Shklovsky, but “a new, non-automatic connection between them.” This paralleled Eisenstein’s ideas of a “montage of attraction.” The motivation behind this was summed up by Shklovsky in 1928: “Eccentrism is a struggle with the monotony of life, a rejection of its traditional conception and presentation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=van den Oever|first1=Annie|title=Ostrannenie: On "strangeness" and the Moving Image|date=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Eisenstein soon broke with eccentrism to theorize his notion of “the attraction” in theatre and film as including, but going beyond, the “stunt” and the “trick,” on their own, in favor of a structure based on the ideological reactions of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Sergi Eisenstein, “The Montage of Attractions” in ''LEF'' no. 3, 1923, translated and reprinted in Taylor and Christie, p. 87-89.&lt;/ref&gt; Dziga Vertov was also to move beyond eccentrism in his work, declaring in his 1926 “The Factory of Facts” that cinema should be “Not a FEKS (the Leningrad Factory of the Eccentric Actor), nor Eisenstein’s ‘factory of attractions’” but “a factory of facts.”&lt;ref&gt;Dziga Vertov, 'The Factory of Facts' (1926), translated and reprinted in Taylor and Christie page 150-151.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between 1924 and 1929 FEKS produced five films under the banner of eccentricism.&lt;ref name="Widdis"&gt;Widdis, Emma, “To Explore or Conquer?: On the Soviet Cultural Revolution,” in Evgeny Dobrenko and Eric Naiman (ed), ''The Landscape of Stalinism: The Art and Ideology of Soviet Space'', U Washington Press, 2003, p.222&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, the Soviet Cinema Week reported the FEKS collective as having twenty-five members, including Leonid Trauberg and Grigorii Kozintsev as co-directors, Hungarian communist Evgenii Enei as art director and the important addition of Andrei Moskvin as cinematographer/cameraman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Youngblood|first1=Denise J|title=Soviet Cinema in the Silent Era,|date=1991|publisher=U of Texas Press|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their films were famous for exaggerated body movements, comedic acting, and extrovert character psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beumers|first1=Birgit|title=A Companion to Russian Cinema|date=2016|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first FEKS film was the 1924 ''Pokhozhdeniya Oktyabriny'' (The Adventures of an Octoberite) an agitational spectacle featuring a farcical villain and a chase scene set in the cupula of Petrograd’s Saint Isaac’s Cathedral.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pokhozhdeniya Oktyabriny|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015240/|website=Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film’s combination of comedic entertainment and propaganda received a positive reaction from audience and critics, but, “it marked the end of the FEKS passion for the bizarre as a self-sufficient artistic objective.”&lt;ref name="Cavendish"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cavendish|first1=Philip ,|title=The Men with the Movie Camera: The Poetics of Visual Style in Soviet Avant-Guard Cinema of the 1920s|date=2013|publisher=Berghahn Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a following film, ''Chertovo kolesco'' (the Devil’s Wheel, 1926), a love scene unfolds on a switchback in front of a funfair.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; Kozintsev described their film as based on the idea that “everything must be active.”&lt;ref name="Widdis" /&gt; While the popular funfair background is enticing, and reflects the spirit of the FEKS manifesto, in the film the carnival is seen as a vacation from more serious Bolshevik pursuits of building a new world, and so can be seen as an ideological self-criticism of earlier FEKS fascinations.&lt;ref name="Widdis" /&gt;

The same could be said of the 1927 film S.V.D. where the “trickster” character served in the plot as a counter revolutionary bad character, questioning the solid identification of the FEKS aesthetic with the eccentric clown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corrigan|first1=Maria|title=Eccentrism’s counter-rebel: the sign, the trickster and the end of FEKS|journal=Studies in Russian and Soviet Cinema|date=2017|volume=11|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In these films, technology was seen as on the side of a progressive [[modernism]], but by FEKS last film, the 1929 ''Novyi Vavilon'' (New Babylon) featuring the uprising and suppression of the [[Paris Commune]], impersonal machinery in the form of guns are on the side of oppression. In form, the sharp focus of ''Pokhozhdeniya Oktyabriny'' has given way to a diffuse cinematography using smoke, diffusion disks or Vaseline on the lens. The change in attitude towards the machine aesthetic parallels the degeneration of the Russian Revolution, and the film received an unfavorable critical reception.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cavendish" /&gt;

== Eccentrism’s demise ==

In its development from the 1921 manifesto, Eccentrism was faced with many crossroads; the aesthetic traditions of popular theatrical entertainment and the new cinema; silent and sound film, and avant-garde experimentation and [[socialist realism]], all within the quickly changing ideas of the role of art in the 20s.&lt;ref&gt;Corrigan, Marina Natasha, (2015) “Soviet Eccentrism: A Can-Can on the Tightrope of Logic,” dissertation at University of California, Santa Barbara.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1928 film production was effectively subsumed under the control of the state, and the soviet government was increasingly under the bureaucratic control of Joseph Stalin. Eccentrism, as with many of the early Soviet Avant-Garde movements, was not to survive the move to the state-sponsored “Socialist Realism.” 
In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Grigory Kozintsev, a founding member of FEKS theatre who had moved to FEKS filmmaking, produced more conventional stagings of Shakespeare at the Pushkin Theater in Leningrad (formerly Petrograd). He later made movies of Don Quixote (1957) and Hamlet (1964).&lt;ref name="SenekickandOstrovsky" /&gt;

Ekeland's principle has been shown by F. Sullivan to be equivalent to completeness of metric spaces.

Ekeland was associated with the [[Paris Dauphine University]] when he proposed this theorem.&lt;ref name="Eke74"/&gt;

==Statement of the theorem==

Let (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''d'') be a [[complete metric space]], and let ''F'':&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{+∞} be a [[lower semicontinuous]] functional on ''X'' that is bounded below and not identically equal to +∞.  Fix ''&amp;epsilon;''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0 and a point ''u''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;F(u) \leq \varepsilon + \inf_{x \in X} F(x).&lt;/math&gt;
Then, for every ''&amp;lambda;''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0, there exists a point ''v''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;F(v) \leq F(u),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;d(u, v) \leq \lambda,&lt;/math&gt;
and, for all ''w''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''v'',
:&lt;math&gt;F(w) &gt; F(v) - \frac{\varepsilon}{\lambda} d(v, w).&lt;/math&gt;

In jurisdictions following the [[English law|English]] [[Common law#History|common law system]], '''equity''' is the body of law which was developed in the English [[Court of Chancery]] and which is now administered concurrently with the [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;'Common law' here is used in its narrow sense, referring to that body of law principally developed in the superior courts of common law: [[Court of King's Bench (England)|King's Bench]] and [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Common Pleas]].&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of its history, the English common law was principally developed and administered in the central royal courts: the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]], the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]], and the [[Exchequer of Pleas|Exchequer]]. Equity was the name given to the law which was administered in the [[Court of Chancery]]. The [[Judicature Acts|Judicature Reforms]] in the 1870s effected a procedural fusion of the two bodies of law, ending their institutional separation. The reforms did not effect any substantive fusion, however. Judicial or academic reasoning which assumes the contrary has been described as a "fusion fallacy".&lt;ref name="MGL"&gt;{{cite book | first1=JD | last1=Heydon | first2=MJ | last2=Leeming | first3=PG | last3=Turner | title=Meagher, Gummow &amp; Lehane's Equity: Doctrine and Remedies | publisher=LexisNexis | edition=5th | date=2014 | isbn=9780409332254 | series=Trusts, Wills and Probate Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisdictions which have inherited the common law system differ in their current treatment of equity. Over the course of the twentieth century some common law systems began to place less emphasis on the historical or institutional origin of substantive legal rules. In England, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, equity remains a distinct body of law. Modern equity includes, among other things:&lt;ref name="MGL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first=John | editor-last=McGhee | title=Snell's Equity | publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell | edition=33rd | isbn=9780414051607 | date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Relief against [[Penalties in English law|penalties]] and relief against forfeiture;&lt;ref&gt;There is currently a divergence of opinion between the High Court of Australia and the Supreme Court of England on this point. In Australia, the continuing existence of the equitable jurisdiction to relieve against penalties has been confirmed: {{cite AustLII | litigants=Andrews v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited|HCA|30|2012|parallelcite=247 CLR 205}}. In England, this view was not adopted: {{cite BAILII | litigants=Cavendish Square Holding BV v Talal El Makdessi |year=2015 | court=UKSC | num=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter part of the twentieth century saw increased debate over the utility of treating equity as a separate body of law. These debates were labelled the "fusion wars".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first1=Simone | editor-last1=Degeling | editor-first2=James | editor-last2=Edelman | title=Equity in Commercial Law | publisher=Lawbook Co. | location=Sydney | date=October 2005 | isbn=0-455-22208-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burrows"&gt;For an example of the pro-fusionist view, see Andrew  Burrows, {{cite journal | title=We Do This At Common Law But That in Equity | first=Andrew | last=Burrows | date=1 March 2002 | volume=22 | issue=1 | journal=Oxford Journal of Legal Studies | pages=1–16 | doi=10.1093/ojls/22.1.1 | jstor=3600632 |  mode=cs2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A particular flashpoint in this debate centred on the concept of [[unjust enrichment]] and whether areas of law traditionally regarded as equitable could be rationalised as part of a single body of law known as the [[English unjust enrichment law|law of unjust enrichment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Peter | last=Birks | title=Unjust Enrichment | edition=2nd | date=13 January 2005 | series=Clarendon Law Series | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=9780199276981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Andrew | last=Burrows | title=The Law of Restitution | edition=3rd | date=2 December 2010 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=9780199296521}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Graham | last=Virgo | title=The Principles of the Law of Restitution | edition=3rd | date=13 August 2015 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=9780198726388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{main|History of equity}}

=== Origins of the common law ===

After the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] of England in the 11th century, royal justice came to be administered in three central courts: the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]], the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]], and the [[Exchequer of Pleas|Exchequer]]. The common law developed in these royal courts. To commence litigation in these royal courts, it was necessary to fit one's claim within a [[form of action]]. The plaintiff would purchase a writ in the [[Chancery (medieval office)|Chancery]], the head of which was the [[Lord Chancellor]]. If the law provided no remedy (or no efficacious remedy), litigants could sometimes appeal directly to the King. Eventually, the King would delegate resolution of these petitions to the King's Council. These petitions were eventually delegated to the Lord Chancellor himself.

In the early history of the United States, common law was viewed as a birthright. Both the individual states and the federal government supported common law after the American Revolution. U.S. courts draw on decisions of English courts, individual state courts, and federal courts in formulating common law.&lt;ref name="commonlaw.uslegal.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://commonlaw.uslegal.com/origins-of-common-law/ |title=The Origins of Common Law |publisher=US Legal, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emergence of the Court of Chancery ===

By the 14th century it appears that Chancery was operating as a court, affording remedies for which the strict procedures of the common law worked injustice or provided no remedy to a deserving plaintiff. Chancellors often had theological and clerical training and were well versed in [[Roman law]] and [[canon law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Sarah | last=Worthington | title=Equity | series=Clarendon Law Series | edition=2nd | publisher=Oxford University Press | date=12 October 2006 | isbn=0199290504 | pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 15th century the judicial power of Chancery was clearly recognised. Equity, as a body of rules, varied from Chancellor to Chancellor, until the end of the 16th century. After the end of the 17th century, only lawyers were appointed to the office of Chancellor. Over time, Equity developed a system of precedent much like its common-law cousin.

One area in which the Court of Chancery assumed a vital role was the enforcement of [[use (legal)|use]]s, a role that the rigid framework of [[English property law#Estates|land law]] could not accommodate. This role gave rise to the basic distinction between [[legal interest|legal]]{{disambiguation needed|date=July 2017}} and [[equitable interest]]s.

=== Development of equity in England ===

It was early provided that, in seeking to remove one who wrongfully entered another's land with force and arms, a person could allege disseisin (dispossession) and demand (and pay for) a [[Form of action|writ of entry]]. That writ gave him the written right to re-enter his own land and established this right under the protection of [[the Crown]] if need be, whence its value. In 1253, to prevent judges from inventing new writs, [[Parliament]] provided that the power to issue writs would thereafter be transferred to judges only one writ at a time, in a "writ for right" package known as a form of action.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} However, because it was limited to enumerated writs for enumerated rights and wrongs, the writ system sometimes produced unjust results. Thus, even though the King's Bench might have jurisdiction over a case and might have the power to issue the perfect writ, the plaintiff might still not have a case if there was not a single form of action combining them. Therefore, lacking a legal remedy, the plaintiff's only option would be petitioning the King.

People began petitioning the King for relief against unfair judgments, and as the number of petitioners rapidly grew, so the King delegated the task of hearing petitions to the Lord Chancellor. As the early Chancellors lacked formal legal training and showed little regard for precedent, their decisions were often widely diverse. In 1529, a lawyer, Sir [[Thomas More]], was appointed as Chancellor, marking the beginning of a new era. After this time, all future Chancellors were lawyers. Beginning around 1557, records of proceedings in the Courts of Chancery were kept and several equitable doctrines developed. Criticisms continued, the most famous being 17th-century jurist [[John Selden]]'s aphorism:&lt;blockquote&gt;Equity is a roguish thing: for law we have a measure, know what to trust to; equity is according to the conscience of him that is Chancellor, and as that is larger or narrower, so is equity. 'Tis all one as if they should make the standard for the measure we call a foot, a Chancellor's foot; what an uncertain measure would this be? One Chancellor has a long foot, another a short foot, a third an indifferent foot: 'tis the same thing in a Chancellor's conscience.&lt;ref&gt;J. Selden, ''Table Talk''; quoted in {{cite book | editor-first1=Michael | editor-last1=Evans | editor-first2=R Ian | editor-last2=Jack | title=Sources of English Legal and Constitutional History | publisher=Butterworths | location=Sydney | date=1984 | pages=223–224 | isbn=0409493821 | mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A criticism of Chancery practice as it developed in the early medieval period was that it lacked fixed rules and that the [[Lord Chancellor]] was exercising an unbounded discretion. The counter-argument was that Equity mitigated the rigour of the common law by looking to substance rather than to form.

Litigants would go '[[jurisdiction shopping]]' and often would seek an equitable [[injunction]] prohibiting the enforcement of a common law court order. The penalty for disobeying an equitable ‘common injunction’ and enforcing a common law judgment was imprisonment.

The Chief Justice of the [[King's Bench]], Sir [[Edward Coke]], began the practice of issuing writs of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' that required the release of people imprisoned for contempt of chancery orders.

This tension climaxed in the [[Earl of Oxford's case]] (1615) where a judgment of Chief Justice Coke was allegedly obtained by fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court | litigants=Earl of Oxford's Case | court=Court of Chancery | date=1615 | reporter=I Ch Rep I, 21 ER 485}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord Chancellor, [[Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley|Lord Ellesmere]], issued a common injunction from the Chancery prohibiting the enforcement of the common law order. The two courts became locked in a stalemate, and the matter was eventually referred to the [[Attorney-General]], Sir [[Francis Bacon]]. Sir Francis, by authority of [[James I of England|King James I]], upheld the use of the common injunction and concluded that in the event of any conflict between the common law and equity, equity would prevail. Equity's primacy in England was later enshrined in the Judicature Acts of the 1870s, which also served to fuse the courts of equity and the common law (although emphatically not the systems themselves) into one unified court system.

=== Ecclesiastical laws ===
Ecclesiastical laws are a branch of English law and were English laws that dealt with matters concerning the church, this was so that religion and law was differentiated. These laws are considered an unwritten law of England and cannot be withheld in the court of law. Ecclesiastical laws are not currently established in the U.S as Common law.&lt;ref name="commonlaw.uslegal.com"/&gt;

=== Statute of Uses 1535 ===

In order to avoid paying land taxes and other feudal dues, lawyers developed a primitive form of trust called ‘the use’ that enabled one person (who was not required to pay tax) to hold the legal title of the land for the use of another person. The effect of this trust was that the first person owned the land under the common law, but the second person had a right to use the land under the law of equity.

Henry VIII enacted the [[Statute of Uses]] in 1535 (which became effective in 1536) in an attempt to outlaw this practice and recover lost revenue. The Act effectively made the beneficial owner of the land the legal owner and therefore liable for feudal dues.

The response of the lawyers to this Statute was to create the 'use upon a use'. The Statute recognized only the first use, and so land owners were again able to separate the legal and beneficial interests in their land.

For an example, see Godwyne v. Profyt (after 1393): a petition to the Chancellor&lt;ref&gt;''Godwyne v. Profyt'' in {{cite book | title=Select Cases in Chancery: A.D. 1364 to 1471 | publisher=Selden Society | editor-first=Baildon | editor-last=William Paley | url= https://archive.org/stream/selectcasesincha00grearich#page/48/mode/2up | at=case 45 (after 1393) | mode=cs2 | date=1896}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===

Equity remains a cornerstone of Australian private law. A string of cases in the 1980s saw the [[High Court of Australia]] re-affirm the continuing vitality of traditional equitable doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite AustLII | litigants=Muschinski v Dodds|HCA|78|1985|parallelcite=160 CLR 583}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court has recently affirmed the importance of Equity and dismissed the suggestion that [[unjust enrichment]] has explanatory power in relation to traditional equitable doctrines such as [[subrogation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII | litigants=Bofinger v Kingsway |HCA|44|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of [[New South Wales]] is particularly well known for the strength of its Equity jurisprudence. However, it was only in 1972 with the introduction of reform to the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) that empowered both the Equity and Common Law Division of the Supreme Court of NSW to grant relief in either equity or common law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU |NSW|act|sca1970183|Supreme Court Act 1970|44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972 NSW also adopted one of the essential sections of the Judicature reforms, which emphasised that where there was a conflict between the common law and equity, equity would always prevail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU |NSW|act|lraea1972263|Law Reform (Law and Equity) Act 1972|5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in 1984 three alumni of [[Sydney Law School]] and judges of the NSW Supreme Court, [[Roderick Meagher]], [[William Gummow]]  and John Lehane produced ''[[Equity: Doctrines and Remedies|Equity: Doctrines &amp; Remedies]]''. It remains one of the most highly regarded practitioner texts in Australia and England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII | litigants=Cukurova Finance International Ltd v Alfa Telecom Turkey Ltd | court=UKPC | num=20 | year=2013 | para=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII | litigants=Harris v Digital Pulse Pty Ltd |NSWCA|10|2003| parallelcite=56 NSWLR 298 | para=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is now in its 5th edition and edited by [[Dyson Heydon]], former Justice of the High Court, Justice Mark Leeming of the NSW Court of Appeal, and Dr Peter Turner of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]].&lt;ref name="MGL"/&gt;

===United Kingdom===

==== England and Wales ====

Equity remains a distinct part of the [[English law|law]] of [[England and Wales]]. The main challenge to it has come from academic writers working within the [[English unjust enrichment law|law of unjust enrichment]]. Scholars such as [[Peter Birks|Professor Birks]] and [[Andrew Burrows|Professor Burrows]] argue that in many cases the inclusion of the label "legal" or "equitable" before a substantive rule is often unnecessary.&lt;ref name="Burrows"/&gt; Many English universities, such as [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], continue to teach Equity as a standalone subject. Leading practitioner texts include ''Snell's Equity'', ''Lewin on Trusts'', and ''Hayton &amp; Underhill's Law of Trusts and Trustees''.

==== Scotland ====

The [[courts of Scotland]] have never recognised a division between the normal [[common law]] and equity, and as such the [[Court of Session]] (the [[supreme court|supreme]] [[civil law (common law)|civil court]] of [[Scotland]]) has exercised an equitable and [[inherent jurisdiction]] and  called the ''nobile officium''.&lt;ref name="thomson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomson |first=Stephen |year=2015 |title=''The Nobile Officium: The Extraordinary Equitable Jurisdiction of the Supreme Courts of Scotland''| location=Edinburgh| publisher=Avizandum | isbn=1904968333}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''nobile officium'' enables the Court to provide a [[legal remedy]] where [[statute]] or the [[common law]] are silent, and prevent mistakes in procedure or practice that would lead to [[injustice]]. The exercise of this power is limited by adherence to [[precedent]], and when [[Primary and secondary legislation|legislation]] or the common law already specify the relevant remedy. Thus, the Court cannot set aside a [[statutory power]], but can deal with situations where the law is silent, or where there is an omission in statute. Such an omission is sometimes termed a ''casus improvisus''.&lt;ref name="nobile_officium"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobileofficium.com/nobile-officium-used-to-recognise-english-high-court-orders-due-to-statutory-casus-improvisus/|title=Nobile officium used to recognise English High Court orders due to statutory casus improvisus {{!}} The Nobile Officium|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:uwH8m1opGboJ:https://www.nobileofficium.com/nobile-officium-used-to-recognise-english-high-court-orders-due-to-statutory-casus-improvisus/+&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk|archive-date=2 Apr 2017|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=J.

=== India ===

In [[India]] the [[common law]] doctrine of equity had traditionally been followed even after it became independent in 1947. However, in 1963 the [[Specific Relief Act 1963|"Specific Relief Act"]] was passed by the [[Parliament of India]] following the recommendation of the [[Law Commission of India]] and repealing the earlier "Specific Relief Act" of 1877. Under the 1963 Act, most equitable concepts were codified and made statutory rights, thereby ending the discretionary role of the courts to grant equitable reliefs. The rights codified under the 1963 Act were as under:
* Recovery of possession of immovable property (ss. 5–8)
* Specific performance of [[contract]]s (ss. 9–25)
* Rectification of Instruments (s. 26)
* Recession of Contracts (ss. 27–30)
* Cancellation of Instruments (ss. 31–33)
* Declaratory Decrees (ss. 34–35)
* [[Injunction]]s (ss. 36–42)

With this codification, the nature and tenure of the equitable reliefs available earlier have been modified to make them statutory rights and are also required to be pleaded specifically to be enforced. Further to the extent that these equitable reliefs have been codified into rights, they are no longer discretionary upon the courts or as the English law has it, "Chancellor's foot" but instead are enforceable rights subject to the conditions under the 1963 Act being satisfied. Nonetheless, in the event of situations not covered under the 1963 Act, the courts in India continue to exercise their [[Inherent Powers|inherent powers]] in terms of Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, which applies to all [[civil court]]s in India.

There is no such inherent powers with the criminal courts in India except with the [[High Courts of India|High Courts]] in terms of Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Further, such inherent powers are vested in the [[Supreme Court of India]] in terms of Article 142 of the [[Constitution of India]] which confers wide powers on the Supreme Court to pass orders "as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause of matter pending before it".

=== United States ===

In modern practice, perhaps the most important distinction between law and equity is the set of remedies each offers. The most common civil remedy a court of law can award is monetary damages. Equity, however, enters injunctions or decrees directing someone either to act or to forbear from acting. Often, this form of relief is in practical terms more valuable to a litigant; for example, a plaintiff whose neighbor will not return his only milk cow, which had wandered onto the neighbor's property, may want that particular cow back, not just its monetary value. However, in general, a litigant cannot obtain equitable relief unless there is "no adequate remedy at law"; that is, a court will not grant an injunction unless monetary damages are an insufficient remedy for the injury in question. Law courts can also enter certain types of immediately enforceable orders, called "[[writ]]s" (such as a writ of [[habeas corpus]]), but they are less flexible and less easily obtained than an [[injunction]].

Another distinction is the unavailability of a jury in equity: the judge is the [[trier of fact]]. In the American legal system, the right of [[jury trial]] in civil cases tried in federal court is guaranteed by the [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]] ''in Suits at common law'', cases that traditionally would have been handled by the law courts. The question of whether a case should be determined by a jury depends largely on the type of relief the plaintiff requests. If a plaintiff requests damages in the form of money or certain other forms of relief, such as the return of a specific item of property, the remedy is considered legal, and a jury is available as the fact-finder. On the other hand, if the plaintiff requests an [[injunction]], [[declaratory judgment]], [[specific performance]], modification of contract, or some other non-monetary relief, the claim would usually be one in equity.

[[Thomas Jefferson]] explained in 1785 that there are three main limitations on the power of a court of equity: "If the legislature means to enact an injustice, however palpable, the court of Chancery is not the body with whom a correcting power is lodged. That it shall not interpose in any case which does not come within a general description and admit of redress by a general and practicable rule."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite letter | url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-09-02-0056 | first=Thomas | last=Jefferson | recipient=Phillip Mazzei | subject=To Philip Mazzei | date=November 1785}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Supreme Court, however, has concluded that courts have wide discretion to fashion relief in cases of equity. The first major statement of this power came in ''[[Willard v. Tayloe]]'', 75 U.S. 557 (1869). The Court concluded that "relief is not a matter of absolute right to either party; it is a matter resting in the discretion of the court, to be exercised upon a consideration of all the circumstances of each particular case."&lt;ref name="Willard565"&gt;{{cite court | litigants=Willard v.

In the United States today, the federal courts and most state courts have merged law and equity in the courts of general jurisdiction, such as county courts. However, the substantive distinction between law and equity has retained its old vitality.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite court | litigants=Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc. | reporter={{law report|547|US|356}} | year=2006}} (Roberts, C.J. for a unanimous court) (reviewing the scope of equitable relief as authorized by the ERISA statute).&lt;/ref&gt; This difference is not a mere technicality, because the successful handling of certain law cases is difficult or impossible unless a temporary restraining order (TRO) or preliminary injunction is issued at the outset, to restrain someone from fleeing the jurisdiction taking the only property available to satisfy a judgment, for instance. Furthermore, certain statutes like [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] specifically authorize ''only'' equitable relief, which forces US courts to analyze in lengthy detail whether the relief demanded in particular cases brought under those statutes would have been available in equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court | litigants=Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson | reporter={{law report|534|US|204}} | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equity courts were widely distrusted in the northeastern US following the American Revolution. A serious movement for merger of law and equity began in the states in the mid-19th century, when [[David Dudley Field II]] convinced New York State to adopt what became known as the [[Field Code]] of 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Douglas | last=Laycock | title=Modern American Remedies: Cases and materials | edition=3rd | publisher=Aspen Press | year=2002 | page=370 | isbn=0735524696}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Kellen | last=Funk | title=Equity without Chancery: The Fusion of Law and Equity in the Field Code of Civil Procedure, New York 1846–76 | journal=Journal of Legal History | date=2015 | pages=152–191 | doi=10.1080/01440365.2015.1047560 | volume=36 | issue=2 | ssrn=2600201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal courts did not abandon the old law/equity separation until the promulgation of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] in 1938.

Today three states still have separate courts for law and equity; the most notable is [[Delaware]], whose [[Delaware Court of Chancery|Court of Chancery]] is where most cases involving [[Delaware corporation]]s are decided.&lt;ref&gt;The other two are [[Courts of Mississippi|Mississippi]] and [[Courts of Tennessee|Tennessee]]. Sources that mention four states (i.e., Laycock 2002) generally include [[Courts of Arkansas|Arkansas]], which abolished its separate chancery courts as of January 1, 2002. {{cite web|url=http://courts.state.ar.us/circuitcourt/index.cfm |accessdate=July 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804025412/http://courts.state.ar.us/circuitcourt/index.cfm |archivedate=August 4, 2011 | title=Circuit Court | publisher=Arkansas Judiciary | mode=cs2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, merger in some states is less than complete; some other states (such as Illinois and [[New Jersey]]) have separate divisions for legal and equitable matters in a single court.  Virginia had separate law and equity dockets (in the same court) until 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia, Rule 3:1; W.H.

After US courts merged law and equity, American law courts adopted many of the procedures of equity courts. The procedures in a court of equity were much more flexible than the courts at common law. In American practice, certain devices such as [[joinder]], [[counterclaim]], [[cross-claim]] and [[interpleader]] originated in the courts of equity. Also, the modern [[class action]] evolved out of the equitable doctrine of virtual representation, which enabled a court of equity to fully dispose of an estate even though it might contain contingent interests held by persons over which the court did not have direct jurisdiction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32960">'''Gendered sexuality''' is the way in which [[gender]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] are often viewed as likened constructs, whereby the role of gender in an individual's life is informed by and impacts others' perceptions of their sexuality.&lt;ref name="Oliver &amp; Hyde, 1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oliver|first=Mary Beth|author2=Hyde, Janet Shibley|title=Gender Differences in Sexuality: A Meta-Analysis|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1993|volume=114|issue=1|pages=29–51|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.114.1.29|pmid=8346327}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCabe, Tanner &amp; Heiman, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCabe|first=Janice|author2=Tanner, Amanda E. |author3=Heiman, Julia R. |title=The Impact of Gender Expectations on Meanings of Sex and Sexuality: Results from a Cognitive Interview Study|journal=Sex Roles|year=2010|volume=62|pages=252–263|doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9723-4|issue=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, both the male and female genders are subject to assumptions of heterosexuality. If a man were to behave in feminine ways, his heterosexuality would be doubted, and individuals may assume that he is gay.

Two main theoretical perspectives dominate discussions of gendered sexuality: that of an evolutionary perspective, and that of a sociocultural perspective. Although these two are typically separate, Eagly &amp; Wood &lt;ref name="Eagly &amp; Wood 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagly|first=Alice|author2=Wood, Wendy|title=The Origins of Sex Differences in Human Behaviour: Evolved Dispositions Versus Social Roles|journal=American Psychologist|year=1999|volume=54|issue=6|pages=408–423|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.54.6.408}}&lt;/ref&gt; believe that these two theories could potentially be reconcilable.

==Gender and sex in gendered sexuality==
Both the terms ''gender'' and ''sex'' have been historically interchangeable, but it was not until the late 1960s and early 70s that the term ''gender'' began to be more thoroughly defined and spread throughout the literature within the field of psychology.&lt;ref name="Diamond, 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Milton|title=Sex and Gender: Same or Different?|journal=Feminism &amp; Psychology|year=2000|volume=10|issue=1|pages=46–54|doi=10.1177/0959353500010001007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term has undergone some changes since then, today it represents how an individual feels and expresses their gender, typically through [[masculinity]] or [[femininity]].&lt;ref name="Diamond, 2000" /&gt; Through this definition, gender has often been used as a variable to study how particular parts of people, (i.e. one's sexuality), can ultimately be informed by gender. Psychological research in this area has tended to follow these three modes of looking at gender:

# Looking at gender through difference in presentation, actions, and traits
# Looking at gender vs. individual difference in individuals who identify as male and individuals who identify as female, and
# Looking at how gender influences how both men and women operate in society &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Abigail|author2=McDermott, Christa|title=Gender in Psychology|journal=Gender in Psychology|year=2004|volume=55|pages=519–544|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.55.090902.141537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human sexuality]], unlike gender, has kept a relatively stable definition by which it refers to all sexual attitudes and behaviours in an erotic, or lack of erotic, nature.&lt;ref name="Petersen &amp; Hyde, 2010" /&gt; The relationship between gender and sexuality is not static, it is [[sexual fluidity|fluid]] and changing.&lt;ref name="Vanwesenbeeck, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vanwesenbeeck|first=Ine|title=Doing Gender in Sex and Sex Research|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|year=2009|volume=38|pages=883–898|doi=10.1007/s10508-009-9565-8|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of this, gendered sexuality does not necessarily follow predictable patterns. Typically, however, gendered sexuality has often followed a [[heteronormative]] path, whereby heterosexuality is seen as what Vanwesenbeeck calls a "key-site" for the intersection between gender and sexuality.&lt;ref name="Vanwesenbeeck, 2009" /&gt; Historically, however, these interpretations of sexuality have been riddled with gendered stereotypes, such as men holding more permissive attitudes towards frequent sex and multiple sexual partners, whereas women are more conservative.&lt;ref name="Petersen &amp; Hyde, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petersen|first=Jennifer|author2=Hyde, Janet Shibley|title=Gender Differences in Sexuality|journal=Handbook of Gender Research in Psychology|year=2010|doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-1465-1_23|isbn=978-1-4419-1464-4|pages=471–491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by McCabe, Tanner &amp; Heiman&lt;ref name="McCabe, Tanner &amp; Heiman, 2010" /&gt; illustrates that gender, at least in the Western world, informs how we understand and conceive of the construct of sexuality. Their study was aimed to discover how men and women gender their meanings of sex and sexuality, if at all, and their results suggest that men and women do talk about sex and sexuality in gendered terms. The most frequent categories of gendering sex/sexuality conversations were:

* Sex is only physical for men, and only emotional for women
* Sex is more important for men than women
* Women's physical appearance is important
* Sexual desire and/or pleasure does not significantly apply to women

The researchers also commented that these four areas of gendering sexuality occurred among the participants without any suggestions or hints towards these particular subject areas. The researchers conclusions stated that gender, in some way, dictates how we learn and what we know about sex and sexuality.&lt;ref name="McCabe, Tanner &amp; Heiman, 2010" /&gt;

==Sexual orientation and gendered sexuality==
{{See also|Gender roles in non-heterosexual communities|Pansexuality}}
Although gendered sexuality is often viewed through the constructs of male, female and heterosexuality, it can also be used in regard to other gender and sexual variant individuals such as [[gender dysphoria]] or those who identify as [[transgender]], [[transsexual]], [[intersex]], [[homosexual]] or [[bisexual]].&lt;ref name="Vanwesenbeeck, 2009" /&gt;

Gendered sexuality and sexual orientation are complementary to each other. Sexual orientation refers to an individuals sexual identity in relation to the gender which they are attracted to. Gendered sexuality refers to male and female genders’ assumptions of heteronormativity. In past years sexual orientation was based on heteronormativity in the sense that only a male and female where to be attracted to each other. However over the years homosexuality, bisexuals, intersex, transsexual, and transgender have been acknowledge and have shown us that what heteronormativity, which was once believed to be the driving force between gender sexuality, is not. With research done it has been proven that it is gender roles, what one things as a normal female and male, is the driving force behind gender sexuality. “Contrary to the hypothesis that females are more sexually fluid than males, we found that female youths were less likely to change identities than males. The finding that youths who transitioned to a gay/lesbian identity differed from consistently gay/lesbian youths suggests that sexual identity development continues after the adoption of a gay/lesbian sexual identity.” (Braun, 46) Even when adopting different sexual orientations gendered sexuality the belief that men and women should act a certain way about their sexuality is still a prominent conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Braun, Lisa; Hunter, Joyce; Rosario, Margaret; Schrimshaw, Eric W. (2006). "Sexual identity development among lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths: Consistency and change over time". The Journal of Sex Research Vol. 43, Iss. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociocultural perspective==
The sociocultural perspective of gendered sexuality holds emphasis on the idea that men and women are social beings informed by the social group of which they are a part, and that the social and cultural aspects of these groups influence the traits prescribed to males and females.&lt;ref name="Muehlenhard &amp; Peterseon 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muehlenhard|first=Charlene L.|author2=Peterson, Zoe D.|title=Distinguishing Between Sex and Gender: History, Current Conceptualizations, and Implications|journal=Sex Roles|year=2011|volume=64|pages=791–803|doi=10.1007/s11199-011-9932-5|issue=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sociocultural perspective deems these traits as performative, in opposition to an evolutionary perspective that describes them through notions of essentialism and innateness.&lt;ref name="Muehlenhard &amp; Peterseon 2011" /&gt;

When looking at gendered sexuality through a sociocultural lens, behaviour that is considered appropriate will be influenced by four areas of social interactions:&lt;ref name="Vanwesenbeeck, 2009" /&gt; behaviour-related aspects, situation-related aspects, partner(s)-related aspects and subject-related aspects.

*'''Behaviour-related aspects'''
The sexual behaviour that is evaluated most positively will determine what sexual behaviours are most acceptable in relation to gender. These behaviours apply to specific groups, whereby positive evaluations drive what is socially acceptable and therefore, which behaviours drive overall behaviour. In regard to gendered sexuality, Vanwesenbeck&lt;ref name="Vanwesenbeeck, 2009" /&gt;  suggests that gendered sexual behaviour, if positively accepted by a social group, is more likely to occur within that social group in comparison to if it was negatively evaluated. In regard to a Western context, this can be seen within heterosexuality in males and females. Gendered behavior is also influenced by family units and consumerism. For example, parents may shop for clothing for their son in the "boys" department. By marketing clothing in this way, the individual's interpretation of sexuality can be externally controlled at an early age.

*'''Situation-related aspects'''
This refers to how gendered behaviour is driven and/or encouraged by the sexual situation within one's direct social community. This sexual situation is referred to by Vanwesenbeeck (2009) as the ''sexual arena'' of the individual. Some examples of this could be: a gay bar, a sex club ''(See [[Ping pong show]])'', or hip-hop culture. These experiences are all situation-specific in relation to gender and sexuality, and have a different meaning of what is considered as "normal" depending on the situational construct. Another factor that contributes to situational gendered sexuality is culture and custom. For some nations, it is customary for men and women to behave in certain ways that are considered unacceptable elsewhere. Men holding hands in India is much more acceptable than in the West, and due to these cultural differences, the perception and reaction to sexuality amongst gender varies.

*'''Partner(s)-related aspects'''
Different sexual interactions will determine how much an individual is concerned with conforming to positive societal influences of gender. Studies suggest that increased interactions and strength of gender performativity enacted by one's partner(s) will more strongly influence one's own adherence to gender expectations. The adherence to these gender norms leaves room for unspoken expectations that may create controversy and tension. As an example, it is commonly expected for men to propose marriage to women—not the other way around. This societal expectation influences the behaviors of men and women seeking marital status.

*'''Subject-related aspects'''
This final postulate rests on the individual, or the subject, and how much a person strives to meet societal gender norms.&lt;ref name="Vanwesenbeeck, 2009" /&gt;

There are several theories under the label of sociocultural perspectives which have been theorized to influence gendered sexuality.

==Social role theory==
[[Role theory|Social Role Theory]] dictates that people are a product of societal social roles set in place via cultural traditions, whereby society instructs all individuals what roles are appropriate for which individuals under particular circumstances.&lt;ref name="Lueptow et al 1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lueptow|first=Lloyd B|author2=Garovich, Lori |author3=Margaret B. Lueptow|title=The Persistence of Gender Stereotypes in the Face of Changing Sex Roles: Evidence Contrary to the Sociocultural Model|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|year=1995|volume=16|pages=509–530|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(95)00072-0|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social role theory can dictate many different types of social roles, in particular, [[gender roles]]. These gender roles imply that men and women have their own particular roles assigned to them via their sex, and that these roles are typical and desirable of their particular sex.&lt;ref name="Eagly &amp; Wood 1999" /&gt;

Gender roles are both restrictive and opportunistic, whereby they dictate an individual's potential through their identification as male or female. In the Western context, this can be seen particularly through the historic gendered division of labour where men and women are fit into different professional roles dictated by their physical capabilities, typically via sex.&lt;ref name="Eagly &amp; Wood 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vanwesenbeeck, 2009" /&gt; Vanwesenbeeck&lt;ref name="Vanwesenbeeck, 2009" /&gt; suggests that: ''"...&amp;nbsp;It's not the biological potential, or sex, per se that causes gender (role) differences to emerge, but the way society differentially treats these potentials"'' (p.&amp;nbsp;888). Conformity to these beliefs occurs when others both encourage and accept these behaviours, which in turn, internalizes these gender roles within the minds of men and women throughout a particular group.&lt;ref name="Eagly &amp; Wood, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagly|first=Alice|author2=Wood, Wendy|title=Feminism and the Evolution of Sex Differences and Similarities|journal=Sex Roles|year=2011|volume=64|pages=758–767|doi=10.1007/s11199-011-9949-9|issue=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Western context, Eagly &amp; Wood&lt;ref name="Eagly &amp; Wood 1999" /&gt; suggest that there are two particular guiding principles of gender role behaviour:

# Male-typical gender roles are often given a higher status of power, which labels these types of gender roles as dominant, and all others as marginal (e.g. female-typical gender roles).
# All individuals of a particular society will attempt to both obtain and perform the specific components which correspond with their accepted gender role (e.g. women will attempt to perform the roles dictated by female gender roles).

Again, in a Western context, these gender roles also carry over to dictate sexual actions and behaviours. For example, a male gender role suggests dominance and aggression, which also carries over into a male sexual role, whereby the male is expected to be sexually dominant and aggressive.&lt;ref name="Petersen &amp; Hyde, 2010" /&gt; These ideologies were inherent within both male and female gendered sexual roles of the 1950s and 60s, whereby a husband was expected to sexually dominate his wife.&lt;ref name="Lueptow et al 1995" /&gt; These roles, however, have changed; there is also strong evidence to suggest that they will continue to change over time.&lt;ref name="Oliver &amp; Hyde, 1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lueptow et al 1995" /&gt; This being said, social role theory, then, seems to also suggests that any [[non-heterosexual]] identity does not properly align with these gendered sexual roles and is not as accepted.&lt;ref name="Oliver &amp; Hyde, 1993" /&gt; This is also known as heteronormativity, which can be defined as ''"...the normalising of heterosexual structures and relationships and the marginalisation of everything that doesn't conform"'' (p.&amp;nbsp;142).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hayes | first1 = Sharon | last2 = Carpenter | first2 = Belinda | year = 2012 | title = Out of Time: The Moral Temporality of Sex, Crime and Taboo | journal = Critical Criminology | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 141–152 |url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/41896/1/41896A.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having to maintain an identity that conforms to these gendered sexual roles, however, has not necessarily suggested positive outcomes. Vanwesenbeeck&lt;ref name="Vanwesenbeeck, 2009" /&gt; suggests: ''"...&amp;nbsp;restrictive gender norms, which undermine women's power, competence, and agency, help account for women's higher rates of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], poorer standardized scores on a variety of psychological outcomes, and higher discontent with sex"'' (p.&amp;nbsp;888).

==Sexual double-standard==
The sexual [[double-standard]] is suggested to be a product of social role theory, whereby gendered sex roles are a part of this sexual double standard. Historically, the sexual double standard has suggested that it is both acceptable and even encouraged for men to have sex outside of wedlock, but the same concept does not apply to women.&lt;ref name="Oliver &amp; Hyde, 1993" /&gt;  Today, sex outside of wedlock is accepted for both men and women in the majority of the Western world, but for women, this idea is restricted to the spheres of love or engagement.&lt;ref name="Oliver &amp; Hyde, 1993" /&gt;

The sexual double standard extends itself further to undermine women, whereby gender roles dictate that all women should be sexual, but sexually humble. It influences female sexual roles in that it suggests that women can never be sexual without being sexually promiscuous. Vanwesenbeeck&lt;ref name="Vanwesenbeeck, 2009" /&gt; calls this the whore-madonna distinction. Naomi Wolf author of [[The Beauty Myth]] explains "Beauty today is what the female orgasm used to be: something given to women by men, if they submitted to their feminine role and were lucky." {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===Research===
In regard to researching gendered sexuality, self-reporting data can often be confounded by social roles, whereby individuals' responses to questions about sexuality will be influenced by one's ability to want to conform to their appropriate social role.&lt;ref name="Eagly &amp; Wood, 2011" /&gt;  Sexuality, in particular, will inform an individual's responses because the area of sexuality is heavily monitored by what are considered [[normative]] social roles.&lt;ref name="Eagly &amp; Wood, 2011" /&gt;  Alexander &amp; Fisher&lt;ref name="Alexander &amp; Fisher 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alexander|first=M.G.|author2=Fisher, T.D.|title=Truth and consequences: Using the bogus pipeline to examine sex differences in self-reported sexuality|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|year=2003|volume=40|issue=1|pages=27–35|doi=10.1080/00224490309552164}}&lt;/ref&gt;  conducted a study to determine whether or not men and women's self-reported sexual behaviours and attitudes are influenced by expected gender roles. The self-reported sex differences were mostly found where there was the greatest risk of participants' answers being read by others, and were smallest in the condition where it was believed that participants would most likely tell the truth in order to save themselves from the embarrassment of detected false answers. The results of the study suggest that men and women are influenced by expected gender roles when it comes to sexual behaviours, particularly those considered less acceptable for women than for men, and that they could actually be more similar than previously thought in regard to these behaviours.&lt;ref name="Alexander &amp; Fisher 2003" /&gt;

==Social constructionism==
[[Social constructionism]] suggests that what we know to be reality is constructed by social realities that are derived from the history of humankind.&lt;ref name="DeLamater &amp; Hyde 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink1=John DeLamater|authorlink2=Janet Shibley Hyde|last=DeLamater|first=John D.|author2=Hyde, Janet Shibley|title=Essentialism vs. Social Constructionism in the Study of Human Sexuality|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|year=1998|volume=39|issue=1|pages=10–18|doi=10.1080/00224499809551913|url=http://people.upei.ca/sgreer/Psych%20102/DeLamater.Essentialism%20vs%20Soc%20Con.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inherent within it is the constructionist paradigm, which has four main points:&lt;ref name="DeLamater &amp; Hyde 1998" /&gt;

# One's experiences with the world are ordered in such a way that we can make sense of them
# Language provides us with a classification system by which we can understand the world around us
# All individuals have what is known as a shared reality of life, whereby we understand how reality differs from dreams by how people, places and other things are organized. We all know and understand this is how people operate.
# We understand that the most beneficial way of going about doing something becomes habituated into the human psyche and ultimately becomes a part of our societal institutions.

These ways that social lives are constructed influences both gender and sex. Gender is socially constructed by the ways in which one's various everyday interactions with people in a particular culture influenced the external presentation and construction of gender.&lt;ref name="DeLamater &amp; Hyde 1998" /&gt;  The social construction of sexuality, on the other hand, is specifically dictated through societal ideologies that limit and restrict what is constructed as appropriate sexual functioning.&lt;ref name="DeLamater &amp; Hyde 1998" /&gt;

From this standpoint, sex differences are simply byproducts of men and women attempting to adhere to their prescribed gender construction given to them by their society.&lt;ref name="Eagly &amp; Wood 1999" /&gt;  Additionally, adhering to these constructions are complicated by a society's technological and situational conditions particular to each culture.&lt;ref name="Eagly &amp; Wood 1999" /&gt;

It is also important to point out that gendered differences in regard to social construction are also said to be driven by relations of power, typically through patriarchal ideologies which privilege men over women.&lt;ref name="Eagly &amp; Wood 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Petersen &amp; Hyde, 2010" /&gt; These power relations influence differences between the genders, which additionally influences variables of sexuality, such as sexual attitudes and behaviours. Similar to social role theory, these constructions are often influenced by physical traits.&lt;ref name="Eagly &amp; Wood 1999" /&gt;

===Research===
The social construction of gendered sexuality is said to be influenced by culture.&lt;ref name="Petersen &amp; Hyde, 2010" /&gt; Petersen &amp; Hyde&lt;ref name="Petersen &amp; Hyde, 2010" /&gt; suggest that there should be a smaller gender difference in regard to attitudes on sexual behaviours in cultures that have smaller gender differences in regard to power (e.g. division of labour between the sexes). They examined their claim by using nationality as a control for gender differences in sexual attitudes and behaviours. Results supported their constructionist claims: the majority of gender differences in sexual behaviours were smaller in Europe, Australia and the USA than in countries with large gender inequalities in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Petersen &amp; Hyde, 2010" /&gt; They concluded that these differences in behaviour can be attributed to the way in which the positions of men and women are constructed within society.

F.|title=Gender differences in erotic plasticity: The female sex drive as socially flexible and responsive|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2000|volume=126|pages=347–374|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.3.347|pmid=10825779}}&lt;/ref&gt;  completed a study that looked at female [[erotic plasticity]], suggesting that women are more susceptible to influence by social and cultural factors in regard to sexuality than men are. His results showed that women had greater sexual variability, lower correlations between sexual attitudes and sexual behaviour for women, and greater influence of social factors on these measures as well. Although Baumeister used an evolutionary approach to explain his findings, Hyde &amp; Durik&lt;ref name="Hyde &amp; Durik, 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyde|first=Janet Shibley|author2=Durik, Amanda M.|title=Gender Differences in Erotic Plasticity – Evolkutionary or Sociocultural Forces? Comment on Baumeister (2000)|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2000|volume=126|issue=3|pages=375–379|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.3.375|pmid=10825780}}&lt;/ref&gt;  suggest that a sociocultural approach related to social constructionism is more appropriate. Hyde &amp; Durik pointed out that in Baumeister's Western sample:

∗ Men have many more levels of power over women than women have over men
∗ Groups of people who have less power often attempt to acculturate their behaviour to those that are more powerful
∗ Both gender roles and social constructions influence both men and women's behaviour, particularly in the area of sexuality whereby heterosexuality is expected for both men and women.&lt;ref name="Petersen &amp; Hyde, 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyde &amp; Durik, 2000" /&gt;

Although other studies have attempted to replicate Baumeister's findings,&lt;ref name="Benuto &amp; Meana 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benuto|first=L.|author2=Meana M.|title=Acculturation and sexuality: Testing the theory of female erotic plasticity|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|year=2008|volume=45|pages=217–224|doi=10.1080/00224490801987465|pmid=18686150}}&lt;/ref&gt; no successful replications have yet to be found.

==Objectification theory==
The [[objectification theory]] focuses on how the body is treated in society, particularly how female bodies are treated like objects. First coined by Fredrickson &amp; Roberts,&lt;ref name="Fredrickson &amp; Roberts 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fredrickson|first=B.L.|author2=Roberts, T.|title=Objectification theory: Towards understanding women's lived experiences and mental health|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|year=1997|volume=21|pages=173–206|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00108.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; they initially constructed objectification theory to show how sexual objectification effects women's psychological well-being (Hill &amp; Fischer, 2008). Sexual [[objectification]] can be seen particularly through the media via sexual inspection or even [[sexual violence]].&lt;ref name="Hill2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hill|first=Melanie|author2=Fisher, Anne R.|title=Examining Objectification Theory: Lesbian and Heterosexual Women's Experiences with Sexual- and Self-Objectification|journal=The Counseling Psychologist|year=2008|volume=36|issue=5|pages=745–776|doi=10.1177/0011000007301669}}&lt;/ref&gt; This objectification can lead women to look at their bodies as objects to be 'toyed' with, rather than an entity which works to keep an individual alive and functioning optimally.&lt;ref name="Vanwesenbeeck, 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hill2008" /&gt;  Vanwesekbeeck&lt;ref name="Vanwesenbeeck, 2009" /&gt;  suggests that this ''"...makes women take distance from their bodies, doubt their bodies' capacities, and results in a lack of experience in using the body effectively"'' (p.&amp;nbsp;890).

Experience of objectification can vary greatly from woman to woman, but has been suggested to considerably effect how a woman experiences her own sexuality.&lt;ref name="Vanwesenbeeck, 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hill2008" /&gt;  Vanwesekbeeck&lt;ref name="Vanwesenbeeck, 2009" /&gt; When women's bodies are more frequently subject to the male gaze, particularly in regard to [[sexualization]], this can lead women to continually police their body image.&lt;ref name="Vanwesenbeeck, 2009" /&gt;  This creates what Masters and Johnson called [[spectatoring]], whereby women are continuously conscious of their outer body experience, and in doing so, are completely unaware of their inner body experience.&lt;ref name="Vanwesenbeeck, 2009" /&gt;  Spectatoring is said to decrease women's overall sexual satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Vanwesenbeeck, 2009" /&gt;

==Mass media==
The majority of sexual objectification comes from the [[Mass media|media]], be it TV shows, magazines, movies or music videos. Brown&lt;ref name="Brown 2002" /&gt; suggests that the media impacts the sexual behavior of individuals in three key ways.

''The First Way''- The media takes on the responsibility of keeping sexuality, sexual attitudes, and sexual behaviors at the forefront of the public eye. Take, for example, magazines such as Cosmopolitan or Glamour. The majority of these magazines will have images and headlines intertwined with themes of sexuality with what they should be doing to stay sexy in order to keep their partners sexually interested.&lt;ref name="Brown 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Jane D.|title=Mass Media Influences on Sexuality|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|year=2002|volume=39|issue=1|pages=42–45|doi=10.1080/00224490209552118|pmid=12476255}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These forms of media, in and of themselves, are enforcing [[compulsory heterosexuality]], let alone gendered sexuality.&lt;ref name="Brown 2002" /&gt;

''The Second Way''- The media serves as an enforcer of gendered sexual norms. Examine, for example, the cultural importances placed on [[heteronormativity]]. As proposed by [[Gayle Rubin]], "heteronormativity in mainstream society creates a "sex hierarchy" that graduates sex practices from morally "good sex" to "bad sex." This hierarchy places reproductive monogamous sex between committed heterosexuals as "good" and places any sexual acts and individuals who fall short of this standard lower until they fall into "bad sex.""

''The Third Way''- The media promotes and encourages the disregarding of the sexually responsible model. Tying back into the previous examples, the media plays upon the assumption that an individual desires acceptance from others. If they display enough promiscuity and sexuality on say the covers of magazines, then eventually people will see ''that'' as being the norm and will ignore their social and moral obligations to be responsible with their sexuality.

These forms of information from the media have also been suggested to educate the public about sexual roles and portrayals of women, and these influences have been said to have different effects depending on the subgroup.&lt;ref name="Brown 2002" /&gt;  The audience of this form of media, and this type of 'sexual education' is also said to influence some more than others. For example, there is evidence to suggest that teenage girls are most susceptible to these forms of knowledge, impacting female [[adolescent sexuality]]. All in all, the structure and foundation of American culture allows for mass media to heavily impact the many different aspects of individualized and gendered sexuality.

==Health consequences==
Sexual objectification is said to primarily impact the psychological health of women.&lt;ref name="Hill2008a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hill|first=Melanie|author2=Fischer, Ann|title=Examining Objectification Theory: Lesbian and Heterosexual Women's Experiences with Sexual- and Self-Objectification|journal=The Counseling Psychologist|year=2008|volume=36|issue=5|pages=745–776|doi=10.1177/0011000007301669}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is said to negatively affect young women by instilling shame, doubt and anxiety within them through body spectatoring and policing.&lt;ref name="Hill2008a" /&gt; These effects are said to potentially lead to even more serious negative mental health complexities, such as depression and [[sexual dysfunction]].&lt;ref name="Hill2008a" /&gt;

Gender inequalities can create health inequalities.  For instance, women live longer than men but are considered to be sick five times as frequently as men. Men experience higher rates of fatal illnesses as well as being more frequently injured.&lt;ref&gt;http://ocw.jhsph.edu/courses/socialbehavioralaspectspublichealth/PDFs/Unit2Gender.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of gendered sexuality also brings health consequences in the medical community, in regard to mental solidity and physical health effects. In 1984 genital surgery was created for purely aesthetic reasons, but it has only recently in 1998 that it was recognized on a wider scale. Two such medical surgeries are known as vaginoplasty and labiaplasty. The vaginoplasty is used to “tighten” the vagina to improves function, and the labiaplasty is done to "'enhance' vulval appearance." Throughout time, and through these surgeries, the vagina and female genital is something that is looked at as a problem that needs to be solved if it is not viewed by society as "perfect." These surgeries cause insecurities among women, objectifying them and creating a normalized view on their genitals. Women are seen to "suffer from comparable feelings of genital anxiety," and will undergo these surgeries, that are acclaimed to be expensive and dangerous, in order to concede to social norms and suppress their anxieties. The pursuit for the "optimal vagina" consequently damages the health of women in their attempt to form themselves to idealized sexual function and appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigues, Sara. (2012).

{{good article}}
The '''hard–easy effect''' is a [[cognitive bias]] that manifests itself as a tendency to overestimate the probability of one's success at a task perceived as hard, and to underestimate the likelihood of one's success at a task perceived as easy. The hard-easy effect takes place, for example, when individuals exhibit a degree of underconfidence in answering relatively easy questions and a degree of overconfidence in answering relatively difficult questions. "Hard tasks tend to produce overconfidence but worse-than-average perceptions," reported Katherine A. Burson, Richard P. Larrick, and Jack B. Soll in a 2005 study, "whereas easy tasks tend to produce underconfidence and better-than-average effects."&lt;ref name="Bordley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bordley|first1=Robert|last2=LiCalzi|first2=Marco|last3=Tibiletti|first3=Luisa|title=A target-based foundation for the "hard-easy effect" bias|journal=Università Ca' Foscari Venezia|date=October 2014|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/vnm/wpdman/94.html|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hard-easy effect falls under the umbrella of "[[social comparison theory]]", which was originally formulated by [[Leon Festinger]] in 1954. Festinger argued that individuals are driven to evaluate their own opinions and abilities accurately, and social comparison theory explains how individuals carry out those evaluations by comparing themselves to others.&lt;ref name="Deepblue"/&gt;

In 1980, Ferrell and McGoey called it the "discriminability effect"; in 1992, Griffin and Tversky called it the "difficulty effect".&lt;ref name="American Psychological Association"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Juslin|first1=Peter|last2=Winman|first2=Anders|last3=Olsson|first3=Henrik|title=Naive Empiricism and Dogmatism in Confidence Research: A Critical Examination of the Hard-Easy Effect|journal=Psychological Review|date=2000|volume=107|issue=2|pages=384–396|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.107.2.384|url=http://home.cerge-ei.cz/ortmann/TrentoCourse/Juslin_etal_Naive_Empiricism_Dogmatism_inConfidence_Research.pdf|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experiments==

In a range of studies, participants have been requested to answer general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances of answering each question correctly. If the participants had a sufficient degree of [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]], their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are [[Confidence|overconfident]]; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident about their ability to answer questions that are deemed to be hard but underconfident on questions that are considered easy.&lt;ref name="Deepblue"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burson|first1=Katherine|last2=Larrick|first2=Richard|last3=Soll|first3=Jack|title=Social Comparison and Confidence: When Thinking You’re Better than Average Predicts Overconfidence|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/41218/1016.pdf?sequence=1|website=Deepblue|publisher=Michigan Ross School of Business|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study reported in 1997, William M. Goldstein and Robin M. Hogarth gave an experimental group a questionnaire containing general-knowledge questions such as "Who was born first, [[Aristotle]] or [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]?" or "Was the [[zipper]] invented before or after 1920?". The subjects filled in the answers they believed to be correct and rated how sure they were of them. The results showed subjects tend to be under-confident of their answers to questions designated by the experimenters as to be easy, and overconfident of their answers to questions designated as hard.&lt;ref name="GoldsteinHogarth1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William M. Goldstein|author2=Robin M. Hogarth|title=Research on Judgment and Decision Making: Currents, Connections, and Controversies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Jo5v25Yn3AC&amp;pg=PA108|accessdate=8 September 2013|date=13 June 1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-48334-6|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
A 2009 study concluded "that all types of judges exhibit the hard-easy effect in almost all realistic situations", and that the presence of the effect "cannot be used to distinguish between judges or to draw support for specific models of confidence elicitation".&lt;ref name="ncbi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merkle|first1=Edgar|title=The disutility of the hard-easy effect in choice confidence.|journal=Psychon Bull Rev|date=February 2009|pages=204–13|doi=10.3758/PBR.16.1.204|pmid=19145033|volume=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hard-easy effect manifests itself regardless of personality differences.&lt;ref name="Deepblue"/&gt;  Many researchers agree that it is "a robust and pervasive phenomenon".&lt;ref name="American Psychological Association"/&gt;

A 1999 study suggested that the difference between the data in two studies, one performed in [[Canada]] by Baranski and Petrusic (1994) and the other in [[Sweden]] by Olsson and Winman (1996), "may reflect cross-national differences in confidence in sensory discrimination".&lt;ref name="research gate"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baranski|first1=Joseph|last2=Petrusic|first2=William|title=Realism of confidence in sensory discrimination|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|date=November 1999|volume=61|issue=7|pages=1369–83|doi=10.3758/BF03206187|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12729705_Realism_of_confidence_in_sensory_discrimination|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

Among the explanations advanced for the hard-easy effect are "systematic cognitive mechanisms, experimenter bias, random error, and statistical artifact".&lt;ref name="ncbi"/&gt;

One 1991 study explained the hard-easy effect as a consequence of "informal experimenter-guided selection of almanac items, selection that changes the validity of the cues used by the subjects for selection of answers to the items".&lt;ref name="tandfonline"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Juslin|first1=Peter|title=An explanation of the hard-easy effect in studies of realism of confidence in one's general knowledge|journal=European Journal of Cognitive Psychology|date=November 2007|volume=5|issue=1|pages=55–71|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09541449308406514|accessdate=4 March 2017|doi=10.1080/09541449308406514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological explanations for this phenomenon have also been offered up by Baranski and Petrusic (1994), Griffin and Tversky (1992), and Suantak et al. (1996).&lt;ref name="American Psychological Association"/&gt;

==Doubts==
Some researchers, such as Brenner et al. (1996), Justil et al. (1997), and Keren (1991), have raised doubts about the existence of the effect.&lt;ref name="American Psychological Association"/&gt;

In a 1993 paper, Peter Juslin maintained that "(1) when the objects of judgement are selected randomly from a natural environment, people are well-calibrated; (2) when more and less difficult item samples are created by selecting items with more and less familiar contents, i.e. in a way that does not affect the validity of the cues, no hard-easy effect is observed, and people are well-calibrated both for hard and easy item samples."&lt;ref name="tandfonline"/&gt;

In 2000, Juslin, Anders Winman, and Henrik Olsson of [[Uppsala University]] claimed that the hard-easy effect had previously "been interpreted with insufficient attention to important methodological problems". In their own study, when they controlled for two methodological problems, the hard-easy effect was "almost  eliminated". They argued that "the hard-easy effect has been interpreted with insufficient attention to the scale-end effects, the linear dependency, and the regression effects in data, and that the continued adherence to the idea of a 'cognitive overconfidence bias' is mediated by selective attention to particular data sets". One specific point they made was that the hard-easy effect is almost completely eliminated "when there is control for scale-end effects and linear dependency".&lt;ref name="American Psychological Association"/&gt;

Several [[philosopher]]s have developed concepts that they have called '''idols''', including:

* The [[Novum Organum#The Idols .28Idola.29|idola]] of [[Francis Bacon]], various obstacles humans face when trying to truly understand nature
* [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'', abstract unchanging philosophical concepts that need to be swept away to allow for true life to emerge.

In the psychology of [[affective forecasting]], the '''impact bias''', a form of which is the '''durability bias''', is the tendency for people to overestimate the length or the intensity of future emotional states.

== Example ==

In Gilbert et al., 1998, there was a conducted study on individuals participating in a [[job interview]].  The participants were separated into two groups; the ''unfair decision condition'' (where the decision of being hired was left up to a single MBA student with sole authority listening to the interview) and the ''fair decision condition'' (where the decision was made by a team of MBA students who had to independently and unanimously decide the fate of the interviewee). Then, certain participants were chosen to forecast how they would feel if they were chosen or not chosen for the job immediately after learning if they had been hired or fired and then they had to predict how they would feel ten minutes after hearing the news. Then following the interview, all participants were given letters notifying them they had not been selected for the job.  All participants were then required to fill out a questionnaire that reported their current happiness.  Then after waiting ten minutes, the experimenter presented all the participants with another questionnaire that once again asked them to report their current level of happiness.
The predictions made by the participants in both the unfair and fair groups were about the same regarding how they would feel immediately after hearing the news as well as ten minutes later.  Both groups accurately predicted how they would feel immediately after hearing the news.  The study showed that both groups felt much better than they had originally predicted, ten minutes later, demonstrating the impact bias.&lt;ref name="Gilbert1998"/&gt;

== Causes ==

Explanations for the occurrence of the impact bias include the following:&lt;ref name="Gilbert1998"/&gt;

'''Misconstrual of future events''':
When predicting how an experience will impact us emotionally, events which have not been experienced are particularly difficult.  Often how we think an event may be like does not relate to how the experience is like.

'''Inaccurate theories''':
People have created cultural theories and had experiences that greatly influence beliefs of how an event will affect us.  For example, our culture has emphasized a correlation between wealth and happiness, however despite this belief; money does not necessarily bring happiness.

'''Motivated Distortions''':
When faced with a negative event people may have forecasts that are overestimated and can evoke either comfort or fear in the present.  The overestimation however can often be used to soften the effects of an event or make it easier by the reality not being as extreme as the forecasted impact.

'''Under correction (anchoring and adjustment)''':
People anchor their prediction on how they currently feel and never accurately adjust their prediction

'''Focalism''':
Often when making a prediction of the impact of an event people focus solely on the event in question.  This ignores the fact that with the passage of time, other events will occur that influence happiness.

'''Immune Neglect''':
We have unconscious psychological processes such as ego defense, dissonance reductions, self-serving biases, etc. that will cushion the effects of a negative event.

== Development in children ==

'''Insight''' is a sudden understanding of a problem or a strategy that aids in solving a problem. Usually, this involves conceptualizing the problem in a completely new way. Although insights may appear to be sudden, they are actually the result of prior thought and effort. While insight can be involved in solving well-structured problems, it is more often associated with ill-structured problems.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R.J. (2009). Cognitive Psychology. Belmont, CA, Wadsworth Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Viewpoints ==

*'''The Nothing-Special View''': Insight is merely an extension of ordinary perceiving, recognizing, learning, and conceiving. Insights are significant products of ordinary thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Langley, P., et al. (1987). Scientific discovery : computational explorations of the creative processes. Cambridge, MA, MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The Neo-Gestaltist View''': Insight problem solvers show poor ability to predict their success. Problem-solvers do not show increase in feelings of "warmth" as they draw nearer to a solution of an insight problem. This supports the Gestaltist view that there is something special about insightful problem solving, as opposed to noninsightful, routine problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe, J. &amp; Wiebe, D. (1987). Intuition in insight and noninsight problem solving. Memory &amp; Cognition 1987, 15(3), 238-246.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[The Three-Process View]]''': There are three different kinds of insights. (1) Selective-encoding insights involve distinguishing relevant from irrelevant information. (2) Selective-comparison insights involve novel perceptions of how new information relates to old information. (3) Selective-combination insights involve taking selectively encoded and compared bits of relevant information and combining them in a novel way.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, J.E. &amp; Sternberg, R.J. (2003). The psychology of problem solving. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

When people solve, or attempt to solve an insight [[puzzle]], they experience a common '''phenomenology''', that is, a set of behavioural properties that accompany problem-solving activity (for a useful edited review of insight problems and their phenomenology, see Sternberg &amp; Davidson, 1995). Other kinds of puzzle, such as the [[Tower of Hanoi]], an example of a [[transformation problem]], tend not to yield these phenomena. The phenomena may include:

* '''Impasse''': An individual reaches a point where he or she simply appears to run out of ideas of new things to try that might solve a problem.
* '''Fixation''': An individual repeats the same type of solution attempt again and again, even when they see that it does not seem to lead to solution.
* '''Incubation''': A pause or gap between attempts to solve a problem can sometimes appear to aid the finding of a solution, as if one is clearing the mind of faulty ideas.
* '''The 'Aha' experience''': The solutions to some insight problems can seem to appear from nowhere, like a [[Eureka moment]].&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R. J. and J. E. Davidson (1995). The nature of insight. Cambridge MA, MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Insight cultivators ==
[[Max van Manen|Max van Mannen]] proposed the so-called insight cultivators to obtain thematic insights when studying a phenomenon or phenomenological topic or event.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Phenomenology of Practice: Meaning-Giving Methods in Phenomenological Research and Writing|last=van Manen|first=Max|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781611329438|location=Oxon|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This framework holds that insights can be obtained from [[Philosophy|philosophic]], [[humanities]], and [[Human science|human sciences]] sources. The idea is that the works of artists, scholars, and philosophers help us gain understanding about our own lived experiences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is the view that this process can yield phenomenological anecdotes that can trigger an understanding that is beyond or more effective than what we could grasp intellectually because of the creative insights and understanding of a phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phenomenologyonline.com/inquiry/methods-procedures/reflective-methods/exegetical-reflection/insight-cultivating-reflection/|title=Phenomenology Online   » Insight-cultivating Reflection|website=www.phenomenologyonline.com|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insight cultivators can also lead to innovative or unique insights because they allow an evaluation of previous literature and experiences that reveal what has worked, what needs improvement, or what is wrong. The insights gleaned can allow us to identify a new way of looking at a phenomenon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18902">'''International Archives for the Women's Movement''' ({{lang-nl|Internationaal Archief voor de Vrouwenbeweging (IAV)}}) was founded in Amsterdam in 1935, as a repository to collect and preserve the cultural heritage of women and make the documents of the movement available for study. The entire [[archive|collection]] was stolen by the Nazis in 1940 and only small portions were recovered after the war. In 1988, the part of the archival collection which had not been [[Nazi plunder|looted by the Nazis]] became the foundational collection of the International Information Centre and Archives for the Women's Movement. A substantial portion of the archive was discovered in Moscow in 1992 and returned to Amsterdam in 2003. In 2013, the institution which houses the collection was renamed as the [[Atria Institute on gender equality and women's history|Atria Institute on Gender Equality and Women's History]]

==History==
[[File:RosaManus.jpg|thumb|Rosa Manus]]
The International Archives for the Women's Movement was founded in 1935 by three Dutch feminists, [[Rosa Manus]], [[Johanna Naber]] and [[Willemijn Posthumus-van der Goot]].{{sfn|Mevis|2004}} Manus was a conference organizer for the [[International Alliance of Women|International Woman Suffrage Alliance]] (IWSA), a secretary of the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (WILPF) and was involved with many of the leading feminists of her day, including [[Aletta Jacobs]] and [[Carrie Chapman Catt]]. When Jacobs died in 1929, her books and papers were bequeathed to Manus.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|pp=150-151}} Naber was one of the founders of the IWSA and a historian dedicated to writing about the history of the women's movement, including writing biographies of prominent women. As a member of the [[Dutch Women's Council|National Dutch Women's Council]] {{lang-nl|Nationale Vrouwenraad van Nederland (NVN)}}, Naber had begun to collect publications on feminism and create an archive for the NVN and by 1921, had urged creation of a resource for other women to study.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=149}} Posthumus-van der Goot was an economist and after she attended a 1934 conference arranged by the Dutch Association for Women's Interests and Equal Citizenship (DAWIEC) to study government policies on paid employment for women, she realized that there was inadequate information on the history of women working.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=151}}

The three women's different skill-sets and ages, which constituted three-generations of the Dutch women's movement, combined to persuade the founders of the newly established [[International Institute of Social History]] (IISH) (which included Posthumus-van der Goot's husband) to give them two rooms in their building at [[Keizersgracht]] 264 for their project. On 3 December 1935, the International Archives for the Women's Movement ({{lang-nl|Internationaal Archief voor de Vrouwenbeweging (IAV)}}) was founded with Manus as president and Posthumus-van der Goot as the secretary.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=152}} Within a year, the official opening of the IAV was held and by 1937 they had established a multi-lingual Yearbook to confirm the international nature of collecting and studying documents about women. The international advisory board, included such members as [[Margery Corbett Ashby]], British feminist and IWSA president from 1926-1946; [[Cécile Brunschvicg]], French feminist, [[International Council of Women]] (ICW) member and IWSA delegate; [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], American founder of the IWSA; [[Dorothy Heneker]], Canadian feminist, lawyer and Secretary of the Women's International Organizations' Peace and Disarmament Committee; [[Bertha Lutz]], Brazilian feminist and IWSA board member; [[Marthe de Kerchove de Denterghem|Baroness Marthe Boël]], Belgian feminist and president of ICW between 1936 and 1947; and [[Elsie Zimmern]], British feminist and ICW general secretary from 1925.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=153}}[[File:Johanna Naber omstreeks 1898 8105.tif|thumb|Johanna Naber]]

The women corresponded with women's groups in English, French and German, encouraging them to forward articles, books, brochures, periodicals and the like for inclusion in the archive. They also had reciprocity agreements with other women's facilities, like the [[Bibliothèque Marguerite Durand]] in [[Paris]] and [[Fawcett library|The Fawcett Library]] of [[London]].{{sfn|de Haan|2004|pp=154-155}} By the end of the 1930s, the archive contained approximately 4500 books and brochures, as well as a collection of around 150 periodicals from twenty countries. Most of these journals were contemporary publications, though there was a complete collection of the ''Tribunes des femmes'' from 1833. Several [[first edition]] books were part of the archive, including ''A Serious Proposal to the Ladies, for the Advancement of Their True and Greatest Interest'' (1694) by [[Mary Astell]] and ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]. There were original documents by [[Jane Austen]] and a manuscript copy of {{ill|Cécile de Jong van Beek en Donk|nl}}'s novel, ''Hilda van Suylenburg'' (1897).{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=156}}

==Nazi intervention==
[[File:WillemijnPosthumusvanderGoot.jpg|thumb|Willemijn Posthumus-van der Goot]]
At the outbreak of [[World War II]] the situation in Europe curtailed the sharing of items from the archive. The uncertainty also propelled Manus to merge her private library and documents into the IAV holdings for safety. This proved to be a costly miscalculation, as when the [[Netherlands in World War II|Nazis invaded the Netherlands]] on 10 May 1940, the archive became a target. By June, German officials had inspected IAV twice and on 12 July 1940 the [[Sicherheitspolizei|Security Police]] confiscated forty boxes of materials, as well as the furnishings and fixtures. The only item which was not taken was the safe, which contained money, other valuables and some of Jacob's papers.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=156}} The reasons the documents were taken has been obscured. The Germans claimed that the Berlin women's movement wanted them, which the German women later denied, though [[Gertrud Scholtz-Klink]], head of the [[National Socialist Women's League]] did admit to having received around 500 books from IAV in 1942.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=157}} [[Francisca de Haan]] a professor of [[gender studies]] at [[Budapest]]'s [[Central European University]],{{sfn|Polak|2010}} believes that the actual reason the archives were taken had more to do with the facts that Manus, the president was [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Jewish]], both an international feminist and [[pacifist]], and suspected of [[Communist]] leanings because of her left-leaning views and activities;{{sfn|de Haan|2004|pp=157-158}}{{sfn|de Haan|Mevis|2008|p=32}} Manus would later be executed at [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]] in 1943.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=159}}

The confiscated records were initially sent to Berlin,{{sfn|de Haan|Mevis|2008|p=31}} and then later were moved to [[Sudetenland]] for security reasons. At the end of the war, the [[Red Army]] took the documents from [[Prague Offensive|German-occupied Czechoslovakia]]{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=160}}{{sfn|de Haan|Mevis|2008|p=41}} and in 1945-46, stored them in the [[KGB]]'s {{ill|Osobyi Archive|de|Sonderarchiv Moskau}} ({{lang-ru|Особый архив}}), meaning special archive, which was housed in [[Moscow]].{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=160}} In 1947, Posthumus-van der Goot, the only one of the founders who survived the war, became president of the IAV and reopened the archive.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=159}} She immediately began making inquiries as to what had happened to their stolen collection, following the lead that women's groups in Berlin had wanted them. {{ill|Gerda Walther|de}}, a German philosopher living in [[Munich]] wrote her that it was unlikely that any German women, except possibly Scholtz-Klink had any interest in obtaining the materials.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=157}} In 1947, Dirk Graswinckel, a member of the committee to recover and repatriate [[Nazi plunder]], returned a few boxes, representing about 1/10th of IAV's pre-war holdings. Then in 1966, a librarian from [[Hradec Králové]], [[Czechoslovakia]] found four books stamped by the IAV and returned them.{{sfn|de Haan|Mevis|2008|p=32}}{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=159}} In the 1960s, the organization filed for reparations under the [[Wiedergutmachung]] program and assumed its remaining holdings were lost.{{sfn|Mevis|2012}}

==Second-wave feminism rejuvenation==
The period of actively acquiring materials ceased effectively in 1939 and through the 1970s no efforts were made to expand the collection beyond what had been retrieved, unless an individual or organization donated materials.{{sfn|de Haan|Mevis|2008|p=32}} Though some minor works were published in the 1950s and 1960s by IAV, and they moved several times, little effort was made to reach those beyond Posthumus-van der Goot's circle.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|pp=159-160}} In the 1970s during the [[Second-wave feminism|Second-wave of feminism]] institutions and organizations began to flourish again. Women's history groups at several Dutch universities began seeking out records on women and re-discovered IAV.{{sfn|de Haan|Mevis|2008|p=34}}{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=160}} Growing interest in preserving women's records and specifically evaluating the history of ordinary women, led to the decision to begin acquiring documents again in the early 1980s, with the specific focus of obtaining journals, letters and diaries from working class women, instead of just women's movement elites.{{sfn|de Haan|Mevis|2008|p=34}} The Dutch government began to subsidize the collection efforts, causing the archive to exponentially expand.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=160}}

Wanting better access to the materials, the first professional [[inventory]] was completed in 1980{{sfn|de Haan|Mevis|2008|p=34}} and the following year, having outgrown their space, IAV moved to Keizersgracht 10 in Amsterdam, sharing offices with three other women's organizations: the Documentation Centre for the Women's Movement ({{lang-nl|Informatie en Documentatie Centrum (IDC)}}), the journal ''Lover'', and the Foundation of Women in the Visual Arts ({{lang-nl|Stichting Vrouwen in de Beeldende Kunst (SVBK)}}). In 1988, the IAV, IDC and ''Lover'' organizations were merged to form the International Information Centre and Archives for the Women's Movement ({{lang-nl|Internationaal Informatiecentrum en Archief voor de Vrouwenbeweging (IIAV)}}) with the IAV archival collection underpinning the new institution's holdings.{{sfn|Mevis|2012}}

==Subsequent recoveries==
In 1992, a report which appeared in ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', a major Dutch newspaper, written by historian Marc Jansen, noted that some of IAV's materials had been located in Russia. He reported that the Russians were willing to return more than thirty collections, including those of the IAV.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=160}}{{sfn|Bosch|2003|p=2}} Almost immediately the state archivists of both countries met in Moscow and signed an agreement to return the twenty-five boxes of IAV's documents found in Russia, but there were delays{{sfn|Mevis|2004}} because the [[Federal Assembly (Russia)|Russian Parliament]] refused to ratify the agreement. In 1993, Heleen Massee of the photograph division of IIAV was allowed to go to Moscow and take notes on the content of six boxes.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=160}}

In the spirit of [[Perestroika]] and [[Glasnost]] policy reforms, historian Mineke Bosch and a colleague, Myriam Everard, went to Moscow in 1994 to try to discover what records were held in the Osobyi Archive. Bosch discovered a leather bound volume of newspaper clippings, photographs and translations which had been prepared by Hungarian women for a visit by Carrie Chapman Catt and Aletta Jacobs, following the [[Third Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance|1906 Copenhagen Conference]] of the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]]. The Hungarians had invited Catt to visit in October, and advised her to bring a German-speaking companion, who was not German to assist her. To commemorate the visit, [[Rosika Schwimmer]] had helped them bind the volume marked with the inscription "1906 October 12–14". Upon finding the booklet, Bosch brought it to Everard and they approached the director and asked if they could return it to Amsterdam. Though sympathetic, the director denied their request, claiming that all items had to be counted before they could be returned.{{sfn|Bosch|2003|pp=1-3}}

Bosch and Everard spent four days in Moscow and inventoried 203 dossiers containing 28,051 documents,{{sfn|Bosch|2003|p=3}}{{sfn|Everard|Bosch|1994|p=194}} discovering hundreds of pictures dated to the 1890s. They found a large portion of Manus' documents but also noted that the collection did not represent the entirety of the stolen artifacts,{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=161}} as most of the 150 periodicals and all of the 4,500 books of the pre-war IAV were absent.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=162}} When the delays caused concern that the IAV archives might not be returned quickly, the International Institute for Social History microfilmed 14 reels of 33,663 individual images, making the documents accessible once again.{{sfn|Mevis|2004}} Though officials continued to press for the return of the documents bureaucracy delayed any action until an announced 2001 visit by [[Queen Beatrix]] to Russia. Finally in January 2002, twenty-two boxes of materials were returned to the Netherlands. Nine boxes, including some of the IAV records were retained because they had not been properly processed. In March 2003, the final nine boxes were sent, and rejoined the archival collection in May.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=161}}

In December 2015, nine books, including ''Beroepsarbeid der gehuwde vrouw'' (Occupational work of the married woman, 1921) by Betsy Bakker-Nort were returned from the [[Berlin Central and Regional Library]], bearing the stamp of IAV or Rosa Manus.{{sfn|Atria|2015}}

[[File:Jugplayer.jpg|thumb|right|280px|A jug player]]

The '''jug''' used as a musical instrument is an empty [[Jug (container)|jug]] (usually made of glass or [[stoneware]]) played with buzzed lips to produce a trombone-like tone.  The characteristic sound of the jug is low and hoarse, below the higher pitch of the fiddle, harmonica, and the other instruments in the band.&lt;ref name=smithsonian&gt;[http://media.smithsonianfolkways.org/liner_notes/folkways/FW00RF6.pdf smithsonianfolkways: The Jug Bands] Compiled and edited by [[Samuel Charters]]&lt;/ref&gt;

With an [[embouchure]] like that used for a [[brass instrument]], the musician holds the mouth of the jug about an inch from their mouth and emits a blast of sound, made by a buzzing of the lips, directly into it. The jug does not touch the musician's mouth, but serves as a resonating chamber to amplify and enrich the sound made by the musician's lips. Changes in pitch are controlled by loosening or tightening the lips. An accomplished jug player might have a two-octave [[range (music)|range]]. Some players augment this sound with vocalizations, [[didgeridoo]] style, and even [[circular breathing]]. In performance, the jug sound is enhanced if the player stands with his back to a wall, which will reflect the sound towards the audience.

The stovepipe (usually a section of tin pipe, 3" or 4" in diameter) is played in much the same manner, with the open-ended pipe being the resonating chamber. There is some similarity to the didgeridoo, but there is no contact between the stovepipe and the player's lips.

As a bass instrument, the jug is part of the band's [[rhythm section]], but jug solos are common. Most jug bands use a single jug player, but there are recordings of period bands that used jug sections of two or more players.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=x8KvAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=jug+band+rhythm&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwA2oVChMIzOnAz-ekyAIVwnY-Ch2nYwu9#v=onepage&amp;q=jug%20band%20rhythm&amp;f=false Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Part 1 Performance and Production, Volume 2, p. 36] by John Shepherd and David Horn, Bloomsbury Academic, May 10, 2012, {{ISBN|1441160787}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Jugs will also produce sound at their main resonance [[pitch (music)|frequency]] when air is blown across the top opening. This method is not used in bands, since it is relatively quiet and produces only a single pitch. It is typically used for making glass bottles whistle. A larger bottle produces a lower musical pitch while smaller ones produce higher pitches. The pitch of a bottle played in this way may be controlled by changing its volume by adding or emptying contents. Loudness is a function of the speed of the air blown across the top.

==History==
The jug as a musical instrument reached its height of popularity in the 1920s, when [[jug band]]s, such as [[Cannon's Jug Stompers]] flourished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jughall.org/main/nominee_view.html?ID=6 Cannon's Jug Stompers] Jug Band Hall of Fame&lt;/ref&gt;  The jug was also popular because it was cheap and easy to carry around.&lt;ref name=smithsonian/&gt;

In addition to the most common [[ceramic]] jug, containers of many different materials have been used for musical jugs, e.g. glass jugs and bottles, plastic bleach bottles, tin kerosene cans, etc. Different materials produce different sounds, as do different sizes. The jug is primarily an acoustic instrument, although amplified and "electric jugs" appear from time to time, and have even been used in recordings, such as by [[Tommy Hall (American musician)|Tommy Hall]] in the 1960s [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]] band [[13th Floor Elevators]].

A version of the jug, known as the [[botija]], was played in early Cuban musical forms such as the [[son (music)|son]].

In recent times, [[Fritz Richmond]] (1939–2005) was a well-known and successful jug player, and his work, found on numerous commercial recordings, provides excellent examples of jug playing.  Josh Smith, (1979-now) of the Glade City Rounders, is one of the most famous jug players touring and playing live.  He is said to possibly be one of the best on the scene by some jug band scholars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4974">In the theory of [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|Lorentzian manifolds]], particularly in the context of applications to [[general relativity]], the '''Kretschmann scalar''' is a quadratic [[curvature invariant (general relativity)|scalar invariant]].  It was introduced by [[Erich Kretschmann]].&lt;ref name="Henry"/&gt;

==Definition==
The Kretschmann invariant is&lt;ref name="Henry"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kretschmann Scalar for a Kerr-Newman Black Hole |author=Richard C. Henry |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |publisher=The American Astronomical Society |year=2000 |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/535/1/350/fulltext/40794.text.html |pages=350–353 |volume=535 |arxiv=astro-ph/9912320v1|bibcode = 2000ApJ...535..350H |doi = 10.1086/308819 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grøn|Hervik|2007 |loc=p 219}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; K =  R_{abcd} \, R^{abcd}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;R_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Riemann curvature tensor]].  Because it is a sum of squares of tensor components, this is a ''quadratic'' invariant.

===Examples===
For a [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild black hole]] of mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, the Kretschmann scalar is&lt;ref name="Henry"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; K = \frac{48 G^2 M^2}{c^4 r^6} \,.&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational constant.

For a de Sitter or Anti de Sitter metric
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = - \mathrm{d}t^2 + e^{2Ht}\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}r^2}{1-k r^2} + r^2 \mathrm{d}\theta^2 + r^2 \sin^2 \theta \mathrm{d}\phi^2 \right)&lt;/math&gt;,
the Kretschmann scalar is
:&lt;math&gt;K=24H^4&lt;/math&gt;.

For a general [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|FRW spacetime]] with metric 
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = - \mathrm{d}t^2 + {a(t)}^2 \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}r^2}{1-k r^2} + r^2 \mathrm{d}\theta^2 + r^2 \sin^2 \theta  \mathrm{d}\phi^2 \right)&lt;/math&gt;,
the Kretschmann scalar is
:&lt;math&gt;K=\frac{12 \left(a(t)^2 a''(t)^2+\left(k+a'(t)^2\right)^2\right)}{a(t)^4}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Relation to other invariants==
Another possible invariant (which has been employed for example in writing the gravitational term of the Lagrangian for some ''higher-order gravity'' theories) is
:&lt;math&gt;C_{abcd} \, C^{abcd}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Weyl tensor]], the conformal curvature tensor which is also the completely traceless part of the Riemann tensor.  In &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; dimensions this is related to the Kretschmann invariant by&lt;ref name="CherubiniBini2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cherubini|first1=Christian|last2=Bini|first2=Donato|last3=Capozziello|first3=Salvatore|last4=Ruffini|first4=Remo|title=Second Order Scalar Invariants of the Riemann Tensor: Applications to Black Hole Spacetimes|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics D|volume=11|issue=06|year=2002|pages=827–841|issn=0218-2718|doi=10.1142/S0218271802002037|arxiv=gr-qc/0302095v1|bibcode = 2002IJMPD..11..827C }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_{abcd} \, R^{abcd} = C_{abcd} \, C^{abcd} +\frac{4}{d-2} R_{ab}\, R^{ab} - \frac{2}{(d-1)(d-2)}R^2&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;R^{ab}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Ricci curvature]] tensor and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the Ricci [[scalar curvature]] (obtained by taking successive traces of the Riemann tensor). The Ricci tensor vanishes in vacuum spacetimes (such as the Schwarzschild solution mentioned above), and hence there the Riemann tensor and the Weyl tensor coincide, as do their invariants.

The Kretschmann scalar and the ''Chern-Pontryagin scalar''
:&lt;math&gt;R_{abcd} \, {{}^\star \! R}^{abcd}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;{{}^\star R}^{abcd}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''left dual'' of the Riemann tensor, are mathematically analogous (to some extent, physically analogous) to the familiar invariants of the [[electromagnetic field tensor]]
:&lt;math&gt;F_{ab} \, F^{ab}, \; \; F_{ab} \, {{}^\star \! F}^{ab}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Laches''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|tʃ|ɪ|z}} "latches", {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|eɪ|tʃ|ɪ|z}} {{respell|LAY|chiz}};  [[Law French]]: ''remissness'', ''dilatoriness'', from Old French ''laschesse'') refers to a lack of diligence and activity in making a legal claim, or moving forward with legal enforcement of a right, particularly in regard to [[equity (law)|equity]]; hence, it is an ''unreasonable'' delay that can be viewed as prejudicing the opposing [defending] party. When asserted in litigation, it is an [[Equity (law)|equity]] defense, that is, a defense to a claim for an equitable remedy. The person invoking laches is asserting that an opposing party has "slept on its rights", and that, as a result of this delay, circumstances have changed, witnesses or evidence may have been lost or no longer available, etc., such that it is no longer a just resolution to grant the [[plaintiff]]'s claim. Laches is associated with the maxim of equity, "Equity aids the vigilant, not the sleeping ones [that is, those who sleep on their rights]." Put another way, failure to assert one’s rights in a timely manner can result in a claim being barred by laches.

==Origin, definition, overview==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
Laches is a legal term derived from the [[Old French]] ''laschesse,'' meaning "remissness" or "dilatoriness," and is viewed as the opposite of "vigilance."&lt;ref name="bld"&gt;{{cite book| chapter = Laches [Definition of 'laches' by Black's]  | title=Black's Law Dictionary | year=2009 | edition=9th | editor-last=Garner|editor-first=Bryan A. | isbn=0314199497 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=weU2AQAAIAAJ | accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Laches [Definition of 'laches' by OED]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/laches|title=Laches [Definition of 'laches' by Merriam-Webster]|author=|date=|work=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Supreme Court case ''Costello v.

--&gt; Invoking laches is a reference to a lack of diligence and activity in making a legal claim, or moving forward with legal enforcement of a right, in particular with regard to [[equity (law)|equity]], and so is an "unreasonable delay pursuing a right or claim, in a way that prejudices the [opposing] party".&lt;ref name="bld" /&gt; When asserted in litigation, it is an [[Equity (law)|equitable]] defense, that is, a defense to a claim for an equitable remedy.&lt;ref name="Little Bit of Laches"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.vanderbiltlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2014/01/Bray-Essay.pdf |title=A Little Bit of Laches Goes a Long Way: Notes on Petrella v.

Sometimes courts will also require that the party invoking the doctrine has changed its position as a result of the delay, but that requirement is more typical of the related (but more stringent) defense and equally cause of action of [[estoppel]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Components==
{{one source|section|date=January 2016}}
{{refimprove science|section|date=January 2016}}
A claim of laches requires the following components:(1) a delay in bringing the action, (2) a delay that is unreasonable and (3) that prejudices the defendant.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;ref name="danjaq"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1040539.html|title=Danjaq LLC MGM UA v. SONY Corporation|author=|date=|work=Findlaw|accessdate=5 January 2016}}{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}

===Delay===
The period of delay begins when the plaintiff knew, or reasonably ought to have known, that the cause of action existed; the period of delay ends only when the legal action is formally filed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.modeljuryinstructions.com/tag/laches/&lt;/ref&gt; Informing or warning the defendant of the cause of action (for example by sending a cease-and-desist letter or merely ''threatening'' a lawsuit) does ''not'', by itself, end the period of delay.&lt;ref name="danjaq"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}

===Unreasonableness===
To invoke laches the delay by the opposing party in initiating the lawsuit must be '''unreasonable'''.  The courts have recognized the following causes of delay as reasonable:{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
* the exhaustion of remedies through the administrative process
* the evaluation and preparation of a complicated claim
* to determine whether the scope of proposed infringement will justify the cost of litigation&lt;ref name="danjaq"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}

By contrast, it is ''not'' reasonable to delay a lawsuit to "capitalize on the value of the infringer's labor".  In ''Danjaq v. Sony'', the Ninth Circuit decided that a screenwriter who waited for a film studio to publicize and distribute a film based on a script he allegedly owned had delayed his lawsuit unreasonably.&lt;ref name="danjaq"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}

===Prejudice===
Unreasonable delay must prejudice the defendant.  Examples of such prejudice include:{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
* evidence favorable to the defendant becoming lost or degraded
* witnesses favorable to the defendant dying or losing their memories
* the defendant making economic decisions (e.g. investing in a movie or a manufacturing process) that it would not have done, had the lawsuit been filed earlier.&lt;ref name="danjaq"/&gt;
Unreasonable delay may also prejudice the rights of third-parties who were unknown in the case, earlier but whose rights got created in the intervening period of the delay (e.g.: the defendant inducts new persons on a disputed property by sale, or by lease)

==Procedure==
{{primary sources|section|date=January 2016}}
A defense lawyer raising the defense of ''laches'' against a motion for [[Injunction|injunctive relief]] (a form of equitable relief) might argue that the plaintiff comes "waltzing in at the eleventh hour" when it is now too late to grant the relief sought, at least not without causing great harm that the plaintiff could have avoided. In certain types of cases (for example, cases involving time-sensitive matters, such as elections), a delay of even a few days is likely to be met with a defense of ''laches'', even where the applicable [[statute of limitations]] might allow the type of action to be commenced within a much longer time period. In courts in the United States, laches has often been applied even where a statute of limitations exists, although there is a division of authority on this point.&lt;ref name="Little Bit of Laches" /&gt;

If a court does accept the laches defense, it can decide either to deny the request for equitable relief or to narrow the equitable relief that it would otherwise give. Even if the court denies equitable relief to a plaintiff because of laches, the plaintiff may still have a claim for legal relief if the statute of limitations has not run out.

Under the United States [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]], ''laches'' is an [[affirmative defense]], which means that the burden of asserting ''laches'' is on the party responding to the claim to which it applies.{{quote|"When the defense of laches is clear on the face of the complaint, and where it is clear that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts to avoid the insuperable bar, a court may consider the defense on a motion to dismiss."&lt;ref&gt;Solow v. Nine West Group, 2001 WL 736794, *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 29, 2001).{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}} &lt;ref&gt;Simons v. United States, 452 F.2d 1110, 1116 (2d Cir. 1971) (affirming Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal based, in part, on laches where papers "reveal no reason for the inordinate and prejudicial delay").{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}} }}

The ''laches'' defense does not apply if the claimant was a [[Minor (law)|minor]] during the time that the claim was not brought, so a party can bring a claim against an historical injustice when they reach their majority.&lt;ref name=MajorityDefense&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92046185&amp;pty=CAN&amp;eno=199|title=USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, Amanda Blackhorse, Marcus Briggs-Cloud, Philip Gover, Jillian Pappan, and Courtney Tsotigh v.

==Compared to statute of limitations==
The defense of ''laches'' resembles a [[statute of limitations]] since both are concerned with ensuring that plaintiffs bring their claims in a timely fashion.

However,  a statute of limitations is concerned only with the time that has passed. Laches is concerned with the reasonableness of the delay in a particular situation and so is more case-specific and more focused on the equitable conduct of the plaintiff. Those considerations are not unique to the laches defense because they are characteristic of equitable reasoning and equitable remedies.&lt;ref name="Little Bit of Laches" /&gt; Whereas, limitation is a statutory remedy.

In the US, the proper disposal of claims in light of those two areas of law has required attention through to the Supreme Court. In ''[[Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'' (2014), the [[US Supreme Court]] rebuffed a defendant's claim that laches barred a copyright infringement suit because Congress had established a detailed statutory scheme, including a statute of limitations.&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fisher, Daniel | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2014/05/19/unusual-split-as-supreme-court-upholds-raging-bull-suit-vs-mgm/ | date = 2014  | title = Supreme Court Upholds 'Raging Bull' Suit vs. MGM | journal = [[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]] | format = online | issue = May 19, 2014 | access-date = 5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4019">'''Mortido''' is a term used in [[Freudian theory|Freudian]] [[psychoanalysis]] to refer to the energy of the [[death drive|death instinct]], formed on analogy to the term [[libido]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Rycroft, ''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (London 1995) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the early 21st century, the term has been used more rarely, but still designates the destructive side of psychic energy.&lt;ref&gt;Jadran Mimica, ''Explorations in Psychoanalytic Ethnography'' (2007) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins: Federn==

Mortido was introduced by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s pupil [[Paul Federn]] to cover the psychic energy of the death instinct, something left open by Freud himself:&lt;ref&gt;[[Salman Akhtar]], ''Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (2009) p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edoardo Weiss]] preferred  to use [[destrudo]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (Middlesex 1976), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Providing what he saw as clinical proof of the reality of the death instinct in 1930, Federn reported on the self-destructive tendencies of severely melancholic patients as evidence of what he would later call inwardly-directed mortido.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Alexander et al, ''Psychoanalytic Pioneers'' (1995) p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Freud himself favoured neither term – mortido or destrudo. This worked against either of them gaining widespread popularity in the psychoanalytic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Akhtar, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eric Berne==
{{Main|Eric Berne}}
Eric Berne, who was a pupil of Federn's, made extensive use of the term mortido in his pre-[[transactional analysis]] study, ''The Mind in Action'' (1947). As he wrote in the Foreword to the third edition of 1967, "the historical events of the last thirty years...become much clearer by introducing Paul Federn's concept of mortido".&lt;ref&gt;Berne, ''A Layman's Guide'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; 

Berne saw mortido as activating such forces as hate and cruelty, blinding anger and social hostilities;&lt;ref&gt;Berne, ''A Layman's Guide'', p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; and considered that inwardly directed mortido underlay the phenomena of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and self-punishment, as well as their clinical exacerbations in the form of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or melancholia.&lt;ref&gt;Berne, ''A Layman's Guide'' p. 95 and p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

Berne saw sexual acts as gratifying mortido at the same time as libido; and recognised that on occasion the former becomes more important sexually than the latter, as in [[sadomasochism]] and destructive emotional relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Berne, ''A Layman's Guide'' p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

Berne's concern with the role of mortido in individuals and groups, social formations and nations, arguably continued throughout all his later writings.&lt;ref&gt;Petrushka Clarkson, ''Transactional Analysis Psychotherapy'' (1993) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laplanche and the death drive==

[[Jean Laplanche]] has explored repeatedly the question of mortido,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/destrudo Bernard Golse "Destrudo"]&lt;/ref&gt; and of how far a distinctive instinct of destruction can be identified in parallel to the forces of libido.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Laplanche/John Fletcher, ''Essays on Otherness'' (1999) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wider applications==

The importance for the individual of integrating mortido in their life, as opposed to [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]] it off and disowning it, has been taken up by figures like [[Robert Bly]] in the men's movement.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Tudor, in B. J. Brother, ''Power and Partnership'' (1995) p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been applied in contemporary expositions of the [[Cabbala]].&lt;ref&gt;Z. B. S. Halevi, ''Introduction to the Cabbala'' (1991) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8822">In [[category theory]], a discipline within mathematics, the '''nerve''' ''N''(''C'') of a [[small category]] ''C'' is a [[simplicial set]] constructed from the objects and morphisms of ''C''. The [[geometric realization]] of this simplicial set is a [[topological space]], called the '''classifying space of the category''' ''C''. These closely related objects can provide information about some familiar and useful categories using [[algebraic topology]], most often [[homotopy theory]].

==Motivation==

The nerve of a category is often used to construct topological versions of [[moduli space]]s. If ''X'' is an object of ''C'', its moduli space should somehow encode all objects isomorphic to ''X'' and keep track of the various isomorphisms between all of these objects in that category. This can become rather complicated, especially if the objects have many non-identity automorphisms. The nerve provides a combinatorial way of organizing this data. Since simplicial sets have a good homotopy theory, one can ask questions about the meaning of the various homotopy groups &amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(''N''(''C'')). One hopes that the answers to such questions provide interesting information about the original category ''C'', or about related categories.

The notion of nerve is a direct generalization of the classical notion of [[classifying space]] of a discrete group; see below for details.

==Construction==

Let ''C'' be a small category.  There is a 0-simplex of ''N''(''C'') for each object of ''C''. There is a 1-simplex for each morphism ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''y'' in ''C''. Now suppose that ''f'': ''x'' &amp;rarr; ''y'' and ''g''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr; &amp;nbsp;''z'' are morphisms in&amp;nbsp;''C''. Then we also have their composition ''gf''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''z''. [[Image:Nerve-2-simplex.png|thumb|right|A 2-simplex.]] The diagram suggests our course of action: add a 2-simplex for this commutative triangle. Every 2-simplex of ''N''(''C'') comes from a pair of composable morphisms in this way. The addition of these 2-simplices does not erase or otherwise disregard morphisms obtained by composition, it merely remembers that this is how they arise.

In general, ''N''(''C'')&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; consists of the ''k''-tuples of composable morphisms

:&lt;math&gt;A_0 \to A_1 \to A_2 \to \cdots \to A_{k-1} \to A_k&lt;/math&gt;

of ''C''. To complete the definition of ''N''(''C'') as a simplicial set, we must also specify the face and degeneracy maps. These are also provided to us by the structure of ''C'' as a category. The face maps

:&lt;math&gt;d_i \colon N(C)_k\to N(C)_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;

are given by composition of morphisms at the ''i''th object (or removing the ''i''th object from the sequence, when ''i'' is 0 or ''k'').&lt;ref&gt;The ''i''th face of the simplex is then the one missing the ''i''th vertex.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; sends the ''k''-tuple

:&lt;math&gt;A_0 \to \cdots \to A_{i-1} \to A_i \to A_{i+1} \to \cdots \to A_k&lt;/math&gt;

to the (''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-tuple

:&lt;math&gt;A_0 \to \cdots \to A_{i-1} \to A_{i+1} \to \cdots \to A_k.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the map ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; composes the morphisms ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt; into the morphism ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, yielding a (''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-tuple for every ''k''-tuple.

Similarly, the degeneracy maps

:&lt;math&gt;s_i:N(C)_k\to N(C)_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;

are given by inserting an identity morphism at the object ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Simplicial sets may also be regarded as [[functors]] &amp;Delta;&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''Set''', where &amp;Delta; is the category of totally ordered finite sets and order-preserving morphisms. Every partially ordered set ''P'' yields a (small) category ''i''(''P'') with objects the elements of ''P'' and with a unique morphism from ''p'' to ''q'' whenever ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''q'' in ''P''. We thus obtain a functor ''i'' from the category &amp;Delta; to the category of small categories. We can now describe the nerve of the category ''C'' as the functor &amp;Delta;&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''Set'''

:&lt;math&gt;N(C)(?) = \mathrm{Fun}(i(?),C). \, &lt;/math&gt;

This description of the nerve makes functoriality transparent; for example, a functor between small categories ''C'' and ''D'' induces a map of simplicial sets ''N''(''C'') &amp;rarr; ''N''(''D''). Moreover, a natural transformation between two such functors induces a homotopy between the induced maps. This observation can be regarded as the beginning of one of the principles of [[higher category theory]]. It follows that [[adjoint functor]]s induce [[homotopy equivalence]]s. In particular, if ''C'' has an [[initial object|initial]] or [[final object]], its nerve is contractible.

==Examples==
The primordial example is the classifying space of a discrete group ''G''. We regard ''G'' as a category with one object whose endomorphisms are the elements of ''G''. Then the ''k''-simplices of ''N''(''G'') are just ''k''-tuples of elements of ''G''. The face maps act by multiplication, and the degeneracy maps act by insertion of the identity element. If ''G'' is the group with two elements, then there is exactly one nondegenerate ''k''-simplex for each nonnegative integer ''k'', corresponding to the unique ''k''-tuple of elements of ''G'' containing no identities. After passing to the geometric realization, this ''k''-tuple can be identified with the unique ''k''-cell in the usual [[CW complex|CW]] structure on infinite-dimensional [[real projective space]]. The latter is the most popular model for the classifying space of the group with two elements. See (Segal 1968) for further details and the relationship of the above to Milnor's join construction of ''BG''.

===Most spaces are classifying spaces===
Every "reasonable" topological space is homeomorphic to the classifying space of a small category. Here, "reasonable" means that the space in question is the geometric realization of a simplicial set. This is obviously a necessary condition; it is also sufficient. Indeed, let ''X'' be the geometric realization of a simplicial set ''K''. The set of simplices in ''K'' is partially ordered, by the relation ''x'' &amp;le; ''y'' if and only if ''x'' is a face of ''y''. We may consider this partially ordered set as a category. The nerve of this category is the [[barycentric subdivision]] of ''K'', and thus its realization is homeomorphic to ''X'', because ''X'' is the realization of ''K'' by hypothesis and barycentric subdivision does not change the homeomorphism type of the realization.

===The nerve of an open covering===
{{Main|Nerve of an open covering}}

If ''X'' is a topological space with open cover ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[nerve of an open covering|nerve of the cover]] is obtained from the above definitions by replacing the cover with the category obtained by regarding the cover as a partially ordered set with relation that of set inclusion. Note that the realization of this nerve is not generally homeomorphic to ''X'' (or even homotopy equivalent).

===A moduli example===
One can use the nerve construction to recover mapping spaces, and even get "higher-homotopical" information about maps. Let ''D'' be a category, and let ''X'' and ''Y'' be objects of ''D''. One is often interested in computing the set of morphisms ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''Y''. We can use a nerve construction to recover this set. Let ''C'' = ''C''(''X'',''Y'') be the category whose objects are diagrams

:&lt;math&gt;X \longleftarrow U \longrightarrow V \longleftarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;

such that the morphisms ''U''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''X'' and ''Y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''V'' are isomorphisms in ''D''. Morphisms in ''C''(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y'') are diagrams of the following shape:

: [[Image:Mappings-as-moduli.png]]

Here, the indicated maps are to be isomorphisms or identities. The nerve of ''C''(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y'') is the [[moduli space]] of maps ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''Y''. In the appropriate [[model category]] setting, this moduli space is weak homotopy equivalent to the simplicial set of morphisms of ''D'' from ''X'' to&amp;nbsp;''Y''.

'''OpenCog Prime''' is an architecture for robot and virtual [[embodied cognition]] that defines a set of interacting components designed to give rise to human-equivalent [[artificial general intelligence]] (AGI) as an [[emergent phenomenon]] of the whole system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cybertechnews.org/?p=915 |title=OpenCog: Open-Source Artificial General Intelligence for Virtual Worlds {{!}} CyberTech News |date=2009-03-06 |access-date=2016-10-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306053354/http://www.cybertechnews.org/?p=915 |archivedate=2009-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; OpenCog Prime's design is primarily the work of [[Ben Goertzel]] while the OpenCog framework is intended as a generic framework for broad-based AGI research. Research utilizing OpenCog has been published in journals and presented at conferences and workshops including the annual [[Conference on Artificial General Intelligence]]. OpenCog is released under the terms of the [[Affero General Public License|GNU Affero General Public License]].

OpenCog is in use by more than 50 companies, including [[Huawei]] and [[Cisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/12/07/singularitynet-talks-collaborative-ai-as-its-token-sale-hits-400-oversubscription/ |title=SingularityNET talks collaborative AI as its token sale hits 400% oversubscription |last=Rogers |first=Stewart |date=2017-12-07 |website=venturebeat.com |publisher=[[VentureBeat]] |access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

OpenCog was originally based on the release in 2008 of the source code of the proprietary "Novamente Cognition Engine" (NCE) of Novamente LLC. The original NCE code is discussed in the PLN book (ref below).  Ongoing development of OpenCog is supported by [[Artificial General Intelligence Research Institute]] (AGIRI), the [[Google Summer of Code]] project, [[Hanson Robotics]], [[SingularityNET]] and others.

== Components ==

OpenCog consists of:

* A [[graph database]], dubbed the [https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Atomspace AtomSpace], that holds "atoms" (that is, [[term (logic)|terms]], [[atomic formula]]s, [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] and [[relational model|relationships]]) together with their "values" ([[valuation (logic)|valuations]] or [[interpretation (logic)|interpretations]], which can be thought of as per-atom [[key-value database]]s). An example of a value would be a [[truth value]]. Atoms are globally unique, immutable and are indexed (searchable); values are fleeting and changeable.

* A collection of pre-defined atoms, termed [https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Atomese Atomese], used for generic [[knowledge representation]], such as [[conceptual graph]]s and [[semantic network]]s, as well as to represent and store the rules (in the sense of [[term rewriting]]) needed to manipulate such graphs.

* A collection of pre-defined atoms, that encode a [[type theory|type subsystem]], including [[type constructor]]s and [[function type]]s. These are used to specify the types of variables, terms and expressions, and are used to specify the structure of generic graphs containing variables.

* A collection of pre-defined atoms that encode both [[functional programming language|functional]] and [[imperative programming language|imperative]] programming styles.  These include the [[lambda abstraction]] for binding [[free variable]]s into [[bound variable]]s, as well as for performing [[beta reduction]].

* A collection of pre-defined atoms that encode a [[satisfiability modulo theories]] solver, built in as a part of a generic graph query engine, for performing graph and hypergraph pattern matching ([[graph isomorphism|isomorphic subgraph discovery]]).  This generalizes the idea of a structured query language ([[SQL]]) to the domain of generic graphical queries; it is an extended form of a graph [[query language]].

* A generic [[rule engine]], including a [[forward chaining|forward chainer]] and a [[backward chaining|backward chainer]], that is able to chain together rules. The rules are exactly the graph queries of the graph query subsystem, and so the rule engine vaguely resembles a [[query plan]]ner. It is designed so as to allow different kinds of [[inference engine]]s and [[reasoning system]]s to be implemented, such as [[Bayesian inference]] or [[fuzzy logic]], or practical tasks, such as [[constraint solver]]s or [[planning|motion planner]]s.

* An attention allocation subsystem based on economic theory, termed ECAN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.opencog.org/w/ECAN | title = Economic Attention Allocation}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subsystem is used to control the combinatorial explosion of search possibilities that are met during inference and chaining.

* An implementation of a probabilistic [[reasoning system|reasoning engine]] based on [[probabilistic logic network]]s (PLN).  The current implementation uses the rule engine to chain together specific rules of [[logical inference]] (such as [[modus ponens]]), together with some very specific mathematical formulas assigning a probability and a confidence to each deduction. This subsystem can be thought of as a certain kind of [[proof assistant]] that works with a modified form of Bayesian inference.

* A probabilistic [[genetic programming|genetic program evolver]] called Meta-Optimizing Semantic Evolutionary Search, or MOSES&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.opencog.org/w/MOSES|title=MOSES}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is used to discover collections of short Atomese programs that accomplish tasks; these can be thought of as performing a kind of [[decision tree learning]], resulting in a kind of [[random forest|decision forest]], or rather, a generalization thereof.

* A natural language input system consisting of [[Link Grammar]], and partly inspired by both [[ Meaning-Text Theory]] as well as Dick Hudson's [[word grammar|Word Grammar]], which encodes semantic and syntactic relations in Atomese.

* A natural language generation system &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Natural_language_generation|title=Natural Language Generation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

* An implementation of [[Psi-Theory]] for handling [[emotion]]al states, drives and urges, dubbed OpenPsi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.opencog.org/w/OpenPsi|title=OpenPsi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Interfaces to [[Hanson Robotics]] robots, including emotion modelling&lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.hansonrobotics.com/w/Emotion_modeling&lt;/ref&gt; via OpenPsi.  This includes the [[Loving AI]] project, used to demonstrate meditation techniques.

== Organization and funding ==

In 2008, the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]] (MIRI), formerly called Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (SIAI), sponsored several researchers and engineers. Many contributions from the open source community have been made since OpenCog's involvement in the [[Google Summer of Code]] in 2008 and 2009. Currently MIRI no longer supports OpenCog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://multiverseaccordingtoben.blogspot.com/2010/10/singularity-institutes-scary-idea-and.html|author=Ben Goertzel|title=The Singularity Institute's Scary Idea (and Why I Don't Buy It)|work=The Multiverse According to Ben|date = 2010-10-29|accessdate = 2011-06-24|authorlink=Ben_Goertzel}}&lt;/ref&gt; OpenCog has received funding and support from several sources, including the Hong Kong government, [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]], the [[Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/drewhendricks/2013/10/02/science-funder-jeffrey-epstein-launches-radical-emotional-software-for-the-gaming-industry/|title=Science Funder Jeffrey Epstein Launches Radical Emotional Software |publisher= Forbes |date= Oct 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hanson Robotics]]. The OpenCog project is currently affiliated with [[SingularityNET]] and Hanson Robotics.

'''Orbit insertion''' is the [[spaceflight]] operation of adjusting a [[spacecraft]]’s momentum, in particular to allow for entry into a stable [[orbit]] around a [[planet]], [[moon]], or other celestial body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/03oct/02144/spacecraft/orbit.htm |website=Thinkquest.org |title=Orbital Insertion |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322031028/http://library.thinkquest.org/03oct/02144/spacecraft/orbit.htm |archivedate=2012-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Orbital maneuver|maneuver]] involves either deceleration from a speed in excess of the respective body’s [[escape velocity]], or acceleration to it from a lower speed.

The result may also be a [[transfer orbit]]. There is e.g., the term ''descent orbit insertion''. Often this is called [[orbit injection]].

==Deceleration==
The first kind of orbit insertion is used when capturing into orbit around a celestial body other than Earth, owing to the excess speed of interplanetary transfer orbits relative to their destination orbits. This shedding of excess velocity is typically achieved via a [[rocket]] firing known as an orbit insertion burn. For such a maneuver, the spacecraft’s engine thrusts in its direction of travel for a specified duration to slow its velocity relative to the target body enough to enter into orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronomy.com/~/link.aspx?_id=8d44e60f-5911-4e5a-ae09-158e39ad8655 |website=Astronomy.com |title=MESSENGER poised for Mercury orbit insertion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another technique, used when the destination body has a  tangible atmosphere, is called [[aerocapture]], which can use the friction of the atmospheric drag to slow down a spacecraft enough to get into orbit. This is very risky, however, and it has never been tested for an orbit insertion. Generally the orbit insertion deceleration is performed with the main engine so that the spacecraft gets into a highly elliptical “capture orbit” and only later the apocenter can be lowered with further decelerations, or even using the atmospheric drag in a controlled way, called [[aerobraking]], to lower the apocenter and circularize the orbit while minimizing the use of onboard fuel. To date, only a handful of NASA and ESA missions have performed aerobraking ([[Magellan (spacecraft)|Magellan]], [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]], [[Trace Gas Orbiter]], [[Venus Express]], ...).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/17918/1/99-1368.pdf |website=NASA JPL |title=AEROBRAKING AT VENUS AND MARS: A COMPARISON OF THE MAGELLAN AND MARS GLOBAL SURVEYOR AEROBRAKING PHASES |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807131644/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/17918/1/99-1368.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acceleration==
The second type of orbit insertion is used for newly launched [[satellite]]s and other spacecraft. The majority of space [[launch vehicle]]s used today can only launch a payload into a very narrow range of orbits. The angle relative to the [[equator]] and maximum altitude of these orbits are constrained by the [[Spacecraft propulsion|rocket]] and [[Delta-v_budget#Launch.2Flanding|launch site]] used. Given this limitation, most payloads are first launched into a transfer orbit, where an additional thrust maneuver is required to circularize the elliptical orbit which results from the initial space launch. The key difference between this kind of maneuver and powered trans-planetary orbit insertion is the significantly lesser change in velocity required to raise or circularize an existing planetary orbit, versus canceling out the considerable velocity of interplanetary cruise.

==Alternatives to rockets==
Although current orbit insertion maneuvers require precisely timed burns of conventional chemical rockets, some headway has been made towards the use of alternative means of stabilizing orbits, such as [[ion thruster]]s or [[plasma propulsion engine]]s to achieve the same result using less fuel over a longer period of time. In addition, research into the use of electrically conducting [[space tether]]s to magnetically repel the Earth’s magnetic field has shown some promise, which would virtually eliminate the need for fuel altogether.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3528">'''''Pacta sunt servanda''''' ([[Latin]] for "agreements must be kept"&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;), a [[Brocard (law)|brocard]], is a basic principle of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[canon law]], and [[international law]].

In its most common sense, the principle refers to private [[contract]]s, stressing that contained [[clause]]s are [[law]] between the parties, and implies that nonfulfillment of respective obligations is a breach of the pact.
== Civil law ==
In civil law jurisdictions this principle is related to the general principle of correct behavior in commercial practice – including the assumption of ''[[good faith]]'' – is a requirement for the efficacy of the whole system, so the eventual disorder is sometimes punished by the law of some systems even without any direct penalty incurred by any of the parties.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} However, common law jurisdictions usually do not have the principle of good faith in commercial contracts, therefore it is inappropriate to state that pacta sunt servanda includes the principle of good faith.
== International law ==
With reference to international agreements, "every [[treaty]] in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in [[good faith]]."&lt;ref&gt;From the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], signed at Vienna on May 23, 1969, entered into force on January 27, 1980, art. 26, and the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties between States and International Organizations or between International Organizations]], signed at Vienna on March 21, 1986, ''not yet entered into force'', art. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pacta sunt servanda'' is related to good faith, while pacta sunt servanda does not equate with good faith {{Clarify|date=March 2018}}. This entitles [[State (polity)|states]] to require that obligations be respected and to rely upon the obligations being respected. This good faith basis of treaties implies that a party to the treaty cannot invoke provisions of its [[Municipal law|municipal (domestic) law]] as justification for a failure to perform. However, with regards to the Vienna Convention and the [[UNIDROIT]] Principles it should be kept in mind that these are heavily influenced by civil law jurisdictions. To derive from these sources that pacta sunt servanda includes the principle of good faith is therefore incorrect.

The only limit to ''pacta sunt servanda'' are the [[peremptory norm]]s of general international law, called ''jus cogens'' (compelling law). The legal principle ''[[clausula rebus sic stantibus]]'', part of [[customary international law]], also allows for treaty obligations to be unfulfilled due to a compelling change in circumstances.

Adapted from Patten and Kelly (2010)&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt;]]
A '''perceptual trap''' is an [[ecology|ecological]] scenario in which [[environmental change]], typically [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]], leads an organism to avoid an otherwise high-quality [[habitat]]. The concept is related to that of an [[ecological trap]], in which environmental change causes preference towards a low-quality habitat.

==History==
In a 2004 article discussing [[source-sink dynamics]], James Battin did not distinguish between high-quality habitats that are preferred or avoided, labelling both "sources."&lt;ref name=Battin&gt;Battin, J. (2004) [http://courses.nres.uiuc.edu/nres407/Readings/battin_ecological%20traps.pdf "When good animals love bad habitats: ecological traps and the conservation of animal populations"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813074823/http://courses.nres.uiuc.edu/nres407/Readings/battin_ecological%20traps.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }} (PDF), ''Conservation Biology,'' '''18''': 1482–1491&lt;/ref&gt; The latter scenario, in which a high-quality habitat is avoided, was first recognised as an important phenonmenon in 2007 by Gilroy and Sutherland,&lt;ref name=Gilroy&gt;Gilroy, J. J., and W. J. Sutherland. (2007) "Beyond ecological traps: perceptual errors and undervalued resources," ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution,'' '''22''': 351–356&lt;/ref&gt; who described them as "undervalued resources." The term "perceptual trap" was first proposed by Michael Patten and Jeffrey Kelly in a 2010 article.&lt;ref name=Patten&gt;Patten, M.A., and Kelly, J.F. (2010) "Habitat selection and the perceptual trap," ''Ecological Applications,'' '''20''': 2148–2156.&lt;/ref&gt; Hans Van Dyck&lt;ref name=VanDyck&gt;Van Dyck, H. (2012) "Changing organisms in rapidly changing anthropogenic landscapes: the significance of the ‘Umwelt’-concept and functional habitat for animal conservation," ''Evolutionary Applications,'' '''5(2)''': : 144–153.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the term is misleading because perception is also a major component in other cases of trapping.

==Description==
Animals use discrete environmental cues to select habitat.&lt;ref name=Kristan&gt;Kristan, W. B. (2003) "The role of habitat selection behavior in population dynamics: source–sink systems and ecological
traps," ''Oikos,'' '''103''': 457–468&lt;/ref&gt; A perceptual trap occurs if change in an environmental cue leads an organism to avoid a high-quality habitat.&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; It differs, therefore, from simple habitat avoidance, which may be a correct decision given the habitat's quality.&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; The concept of a perceptual trap is related to that of an [[ecological trap]], in which environmental change causes preference towards a low-quality habitat.&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; There is expected to be strong [[natural selection]] against ecological traps, but not necessarily against perceptual traps, as [[Allee effect]]s may restrict a population’s ability to establish itself.&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt;

==Examples==
[[File:Lesser Prairie Chicken.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Patten and Kelly&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; propose that a perceptual trap is acting on populations of the [[lesser prairie chicken]]]]
To support the concept of a perceptual trap, Patten and Kelly&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; cited a study of the [[lesser prairie chicken]] (''Tympanuchus pallidicinctus''). The species' natural environment, [[shinnery oak]] [[grassland]], is often treated with the [[herbicide]] [[tebuthiuron]] to increase grass cover for [[grazing|cattle grazing]].&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; Herbicide treatment resulted in less shrub cover, a habitat cue that caused female lesser prairie-chickens to avoid the habitat in favour of untreated areas. However, females who nested in  herbicide-treated areas achieved comparable nesting successes and [[clutch size]]s to those in untreated areas.&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; Patten and Kelly suggest that the adverse effects of tebuthiuron treatment on nesting success are countered by various effects, such as greater nest concealment through increased grass cover.&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; Therefore, female birds are erroneously avoiding a high-quality habitat. Patten and Kelly&lt;ref name=Patten/&gt; also cited as a possible perceptual trap the cases of the [[spotted towhee]] (''Pipilo maculatus'') and [[rufous-crowned sparrow]] (''Aimophila ruficeps''), which tend to avoid habitat fragments, even though birds nesting in habitat fragments achieve increased nesting success due to a reduction in [[snake]] predation.&lt;ref name=Patten2&gt;Patten, M. A., and D. T. Bolger (2003) "Variation in top-down control of avian reproductive success across a fragmentation gradient", ''Oikos,'' '''101''':479–488&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law legal systems]], '''precedent''' is a principle or rule established in a previous [[legal case]] that is either binding on or persuasive for a [[court]] or other [[tribunal]] when deciding subsequent cases with similar issues or [[fact]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Precedent | url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/precedent?s=t | publisher= Dictionary.com | accessdate=September 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, p. 1059 (5th ed. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pattinson|first=Shaun D|date=2015-03-01|title=The Human Rights Act and the doctrine of precedent|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/lest.12049/abstract|journal=Legal Studies|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|pages=142–164|doi=10.1111/lest.12049|issn=1748-121X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|Common-law]] legal systems place great value on deciding cases according to consistent principled rules, so that similar facts will yield similar and predictable outcomes, and observance of precedent is the mechanism by which that goal is attained. The principle by which judges are bound to precedents is known as '''''stare decisis'''''.  [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|Common-law precedent]] is a third kind of law, on equal footing with [[statutory law]] (that is, statutes and codes enacted by legislative bodies) and [[delegated legislation]] (in U.K. parlance) or [[regulatory law]] (in U.S. parlance) (that is, regulations promulgated by executive branch agencies).

[[Case law]], in common-law jurisdictions, is the set of decisions of adjudicatory tribunals or other rulings that can be cited as precedent. In most countries, including most European countries, the term is applied to any set of rulings on law, which is guided by previous rulings, for example, previous decisions of a government agency.

Essential to the development of case law is the publication and indexing of decisions for use by lawyers, courts, and the general public, in the form of [[law reports]]. While all decisions are precedent (though at varying levels of authority as discussed throughout this article), some become [[Lists of landmark court decisions|"leading cases" or "landmark decisions"]] that are cited especially often.

In [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, past decisions may [[precedent#Precedent_in_civil_law|influence]] future decisions, even if they do not have the precedential, binding effect that they have in common law decision-making.

==Principle==
''Stare decisis'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|eɪ|r|i|_|d|ᵻ|ˈ|s|aɪ|s|ᵻ|s|,_|ˈ|s|t|ɑː|r|eɪ}}) is a legal principle by which judges are obligated to respect the precedent established by prior decisions. The words originate from the phrasing of the principle in the [[Latin]] maxim ''Stare decisis et non quieta movere'': "to stand by decisions and not disturb the undisturbed".&lt;ref name=Adeleye&gt;Adeleye, Gabriel et al. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=a4ddQNrt8e8C&amp;pg=PA371 World Dictionary of Foreign Expressions: a Resource for Readers and Writers]'', page 371 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; In a legal context, this means that courts should abide by precedent and not disturb settled matters.&lt;ref name=Adeleye /&gt;  The principle can be divided into two components:&lt;ref name=kmiec/&gt;

# A decision made by a superior court, or by the same court in an earlier decision, is binding precedent that the court itself and all its inferior courts must follow.&lt;ref name=kmiec/&gt;
# A court may overturn its own precedent, but should do so only if a strong reason exists to do so, and even in that case, should be guided by principles from superior, lateral, and inferior courts.&lt;ref name=kmiec/&gt;

The second principle, regarding [[persuasive precedent]], reflects the broad precedent guidance a court may draw upon in reaching all of its decisions.&lt;ref name=kmiec&gt;Kmiec, Keenan. The Origin and Current Meanings of "Judicial Activism", ''California Law Review'' (2004):

{{quote|Some instances of disregarding precedent are almost universally considered inappropriate. For example, in a rare showing of unity in a Supreme Court opinion discussing judicial activism, Justice Stevens wrote that a circuit court "engaged in an indefensible brand of judicial activism" when it "refused to follow" a "controlling precedent" of the Supreme Court. The rule that lower courts should abide by controlling precedent, sometimes called "'''''vertical precedent'''''," can safely be called settled law. It appears to be equally well accepted that the act of disregarding vertical precedent qualifies as one kind of judicial activism. "'''''Horizontal precedent'''''," the doctrine requiring a court "to follow its own prior decisions in similar cases," is a more complicated and debatable matter....[A]cademics argue that it is sometimes proper to disregard horizontal precedent. Professor Gary Lawson, for example, has argued that ''stare decisis'' itself may be unconstitutional if it requires the Court to adhere to an erroneous reading of the Constitution. "If the Constitution says X and a prior judicial decision says Y, a court has not merely the power, but the obligation, to prefer the Constitution." In the same vein, Professors Ahkil Amar and Vikram Amar have stated, "Our general view is that the Rehnquist Court's articulated theory of ''stare decisis'' tends to improperly elevate judicial doctrine over the Constitution itself." It does so, they argue, "by requiring excessive deference to past decisions that themselves may have been misinterpretations of the law of the land.

For Lawson, Akhil Amar, and Vikram Amar, dismissing erroneous horizontal precedent would not be judicial activism; instead, it would be appropriate constitutional decisionmaking.|Walton Myers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case law in common-law systems===
In the [[common-law]] tradition, courts decide the law applicable to a case by interpreting statutes and applying precedent, which record how and why prior [[Legal case|cases]] have been decided. Unlike most civil-law systems, [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common-law]] systems follow the doctrine of ''stare decisis'', by which most courts are bound by their own previous decisions in similar cases, and all lower courts should make decisions consistent with previous decisions of higher courts.&lt;ref name="pdf"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/CivilLaw.pdf/$file/CivilLaw.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501215549/http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/CivilLaw.pdf/$file/CivilLaw.pdf |archive-date=2013-05-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example in England, the [[High Court]] and the [[Court of Appeal]] are each bound by their own previous decisions, but the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] is able to deviate from its earlier decisions, although in practice it rarely does so.

Generally speaking, higher courts do not have direct oversight over day-to-day proceedings in lower [[court of record|courts]], in that they cannot reach out on their own initiative (''sua sponte'') at any time to reverse or overrule decisions of the lower courts. Normally, the burden rests with litigants to appeal rulings (including those in clear violation of established case law) to the higher courts. If a judge acts against precedent and the case is not [[appeal]]ed, the decision will stand.

A lower court may not rule against a binding precedent, even if the lower court feels that the precedent is unjust; the lower court may only express the hope that a higher court or the legislature will reform the rule in question. If the court believes that developments or trends in legal reasoning render the precedent unhelpful, and wishes to evade it and help the law evolve, the court may either hold that the precedent is inconsistent with subsequent authority, or that the precedent should be "distinguished: by some material difference between the facts of the cases.  If that decision goes to appeal, the appellate court will have the opportunity to review both the precedent and the case under appeal, perhaps overruling the previous case law by setting a new precedent of higher authority. This may happen several times as the case works its way through successive appeals. [[Lord Denning]], first of the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales|High Court of Justice]], later of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], provided a famous example of this evolutionary process in his development of the concept of [[estoppel]] starting in the ''High Trees'' case: ''[[Central London Property Trust Ltd v. High Trees House Ltd]]'' [1947] K.B. 130.

Judges may refer to various types of persuasive authority to reach a decision in a case. Widely cited nonbinding sources include legal [[encyclopedia]]s such as ''[[Corpus Juris Secundum]]'' and ''[[Halsbury's Laws of England]]'', or the published work of the [[Law Commission]] or the [[American Law Institute]]. Some bodies are given statutory powers to issue guidance with persuasive authority or similar statutory effect, such as the [[Highway Code]].

In federal or multijurisdictional law systems,  conflicts may exist between the various lower appellate courts. Sometimes these differences may not be resolved and  distinguishing how the law is applied in one [[district]], province, division or [[appellate court|appellate department]] may be necessary. Usually, only an appeal accepted by the [[court of last resort]] will resolve such differences, and for many reasons, such appeals are often not granted.

Any court may seek to distinguish its present case from that of a binding precedent, to reach a different conclusion. The validity of such a distinction may or may not be accepted on appeal. An appellate court may also propound an entirely new and different analysis from that of junior courts, and may or may not be bound by its own previous decisions, or in any case may distinguish the decisions based on significant differences in the facts applicable to each case.  Or, a court may view the matter before it as one of "[[Precedent#Matter of first impression|first impression]]", not governed by any controlling precedent.&lt;ref&gt;Coale &amp; Dyrek, [http://600camp.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/First-Impressions.pdf "First Impressions"], ''Appellate Advocate'' (Winter 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

When various members of a multi-judge court write separate opinions, the reasoning may differ; only the ''[[ratio decidendi]]'' of the majority becomes binding precedent.  For example, if a 12-member court splits 5-2-3-2 in four different opinions on several different issues, whatever reasoning commands seven votes on each specific issue, and the seven-judge majorities may differ issue-to-issue.  All may be cited as persuasive (though of course opinions that concur in the majority result are more persuasive than dissents).

Quite apart from the rules of precedent, the weight actually given to any reported opinion may depend on the reputation of both the court and the judges with respect to the specific issue.  For example, in the United States, the Second Circuit (New York and surrounding states) is especially respected in commercial and securities law, the Seventh Circuit (in Chicago), especially Judge Posner, is highly regarded on antitrust, and the District of Columbia  Circuit is highly regarded on administrative law,

==Categories and classifications of precedent, and effect of classification==

===Verticality===
Generally, a [[common law]] court system has [[trial court]]s, intermediate [[appellate court]]s and a [[supreme court]]. The inferior courts conduct almost all trial proceedings. The inferior courts are bound to obey precedent established by the appellate court for their jurisdiction, and all supreme court precedent.

The [[Supreme Court of California]]'s explanation of this principle is that

{{quote|[u]nder the doctrine of ''stare decisis'', all tribunals exercising inferior jurisdiction are required to follow decisions of courts exercising superior jurisdiction. Otherwise, the doctrine of ''stare decisis'' makes no sense. The decisions of this court are binding upon and must be followed by all the state courts of California. Decisions of every division of the [[California Courts of Appeal|District Courts of Appeal]] are binding upon all the justice and municipal courts and upon all the [[Superior Courts of California|superior courts of this state]], and this is so whether or not the superior court is acting as a trial or appellate court. Courts exercising inferior jurisdiction must accept the law declared by courts of superior jurisdiction. It is not their function to attempt to overrule decisions of a higher court.&lt;ref&gt;''Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C2/57C2d450.htm 57 Cal. 2d 450] (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An Intermediate state appellate court is generally bound to follow the decisions of the highest court of that state.

The application of the doctrine of ''stare decisis'' from a superior court to an inferior court is sometimes called ''vertical stare decisis''.

===Horizontality===

The idea that a judge is bound by (or at least should respect) decisions of earlier judges of similar or coordinate level is called horizontal ''stare decisis''.

In the [[United States federal court system]], the intermediate appellate courts are divided into thirteen "circuits," each covering some range of territory ranging in size from the District of Columbia alone up to seven states. Each panel of judges on the [[United States court of appeals|court of appeals]] for a circuit is bound to obey the prior appellate decisions of the same circuit.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Precedent of a United States court of appeals may be overruled only by the court ''[[en banc#United States Courts of Appeals|en banc]],'' that is, a session of all the active appellate judges of the circuit, or by the [[United States Supreme Court]], not simply by a different three-judge panel.

When a court binds itself, this application of the doctrine of precedent is sometimes called ''horizontal stare decisis''. The state of [[New York (state)|New York]] has a similar appellate structure as it is divided into four [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|appellate departments]] supervised by the final [[New York Court of Appeals]]. Decisions of one appellate department are not binding upon another, and in some cases the departments differ considerably on interpretations of law.

===Federalism and parallel state and federal courts===

In federal systems the division between federal and state law may result in complex interactions.  In the United States, state courts are not considered inferior to federal courts but rather constitute a parallel court system.

*  When a federal court rules on an issue of state law, the federal court must follow the precedent of the state courts, under the [[Erie doctrine]]. If an issue of state law arises during a case in federal court, and there is no decision on point from the highest court of the state, the federal court must either attempt to predict how the state courts would resolve the issue by looking at decisions from state appellate courts, or, if allowed by the constitution of the relevant state, [[certified question|submit]] the question to the state's courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.law.lsu.edu/toddbruno/mandatory_v__persuasive.htm |title=Mandatory v.

* On the other hand, when a state court rules on an issue of federal law, the state court is bound only by rulings of the Supreme Court, but not by decisions of federal district or circuit courts of appeals&lt;ref name="40 Cal. 4th 1370, 1416"&gt;''People v.

In practice, however, judges in one system will almost always choose to follow relevant case law in the other system to prevent divergent results and to minimize [[forum shopping]].

===Binding precedent===

Precedent that must be applied or followed is known as ''binding precedent'' (alternately ''metaphorically precedent'', ''mandatory'' or ''binding authority'', etc.). Under the doctrine of ''stare decisis'', a [[lower court]] must honor findings of law made by a higher court that is within the appeals path of cases the court hears. In state and federal courts in the United States of America, jurisdiction is often divided geographically among local trial courts, several of which fall under the territory of a regional appeals court. All appellate courts fall under a highest court (sometimes but not always called a "supreme court"). By definition, decisions of lower courts are not binding on courts higher in the system, nor are appeals court decisions binding on local courts that fall under a different appeals court. Further, courts must follow their own proclamations of law made earlier on other cases, and honor rulings made by other courts in disputes among the parties before them pertaining to the same pattern of facts or events, unless they have a strong reason to change these rulings (see [[Law of the case]] re: a court's previous holding being binding precedent for that court).

In [[law]], a binding precedent (also known as a mandatory precedent or binding authority) is a precedent which must be followed by all [[lower court]]s under [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law]] [[Legal systems of the world|legal systems]]. In [[English law]] it is usually created by the decision of a higher court, such as the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]], which took over the [[judicial functions of the House of Lords]] in 2009. In [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] and [[legal pluralism|pluralist]] systems precedent is not binding but [[case law]] is taken into account by the courts.

Binding precedent relies on the [[legal principle]] of ''stare decisis''. ''Stare decisis'' means to stand by things decided. It ensures certainty and consistency in the application of law. Existing binding precedent from past cases are applied in principle to new situations by analogy.

One law professor has described mandatory precedent as follows:

:Given a determination as to the governing jurisdiction, a court is "bound" to follow a precedent of that jurisdiction only if it is directly in point. In the strongest sense, "directly in point" means that: (1) the question resolved in the precedent case is the same as the question to be resolved in the pending case, (2) resolution of that question was necessary to the disposition of the precedent case; (3) the significant facts of the precedent case are also presented in the pending case, and (4) no additional facts appear in the pending case that might be treated as significant.&lt;ref&gt;Marjorie D. Rombauer, ''Legal Problem Solving: Analysis, Research and Writing'', pp. 22-23 (West Publishing Co., 3d ed. 1978). (Rombauer was a professor of law at the University of Washington.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In extraordinary circumstances a higher court may overturn or overrule mandatory precedent, but will often attempt to [[distinguish]] the precedent before overturning it, thereby limiting the scope of the precedent.

Under the U.S. legal system, courts are set up in a hierarchy. At the top of the federal or national system is the Supreme Court, and underneath are lower federal courts. The state court systems have hierarchy structures similar to that of the federal system.

The U.S. Supreme Court has final authority on questions about the meaning of federal law, including the U.S. Constitution. For example, when the Supreme Court says that the First Amendment applies in a specific way to suits for slander, then every court is bound by that precedent in its interpretation of the First Amendment as it applies to suits for slander. If a lower court judge disagrees with a higher court precedent on what the First Amendment should mean, the lower court judge must rule according to the binding precedent. Until the higher court changes the ruling (or the law itself is changed), the binding precedent is authoritative on the meaning of the law.

Lower courts are bound by the precedent set by higher courts within their region. Thus, a federal district court that falls within the geographic boundaries of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals (the mid-level appeals court that hears appeals from district court decisions from Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and the Virgin Islands) is bound by rulings of the Third Circuit Court, but not by rulings in the Ninth Circuit (Alaska, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Northern Mariana Islands, Oregon, and Washington), since the Circuit Courts of Appeals have jurisdiction defined by geography. The Circuit Courts of Appeals can interpret the law how they want, so long as there is no binding Supreme Court precedent. One of the common reasons the Supreme Court grants [[certiorari]] (that is, they agree to hear a case) is if there is a conflict among the circuit courts as to the meaning of a federal law.

There are three elements needed for a precedent to work. Firstly, the hierarchy of the courts needs to be accepted, and an efficient system of law reporting. 'A balance must be struck between the need on one side for the [[legal certainty]] resulting from the binding effect of previous decisions, and on the other side the avoidance of undue restriction on the proper development of the law (1966 Practice Statement (Judicial Precedent) by Lord Gardiner L.C.)'.

====Binding precedent in English law====
Judges are bound by the law of binding precedent in [[England and Wales]] and other [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law]] jurisdictions. This is a distinctive feature of the English legal system. In Scotland and many countries throughout the world, particularly in mainland Europe, civil law means that judges take case law into account in a similar way, but are not obliged to do so and are required to consider the precedent in terms of principle. Their fellow judges' decisions may be persuasive but are not binding. Under the English legal system, judges are not necessarily entitled to make their own decisions about the development or interpretations of the law. They may be bound by a decision reached in a previous case. Two facts are crucial to determining whether a precedent is binding:
# The position in the court hierarchy of the court which decided the precedent, relative to the position in the court trying the current case.
# Whether the facts of the current case come within the scope of the principle of law in previous decisions.

In a [[conflict of laws]] situation, [[jus cogens]] [[erga omnes]] norms and principles of the common law such as in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], to a varying degree in different jurisdictions, are deemed overriding which means they are used to "read down" legislation, that is giving them a particular [[purposive interpretation]], for example applying [[European Court of Human Rights]] [[jurisprudence]] of courts ([[case law]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===="Super ''stare decisis''"====

"Super ''stare decisis''" is a term used for important precedent that is resistant or immune from being overturned, without regard to whether correctly decided in the first place. It may be viewed as one extreme in a range of precedential power,&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, Michael. [http://www.law.gmu.edu/gmulawreview/issues/14-2/documents/SINCLAIR.pdf "Precedent, Super-Precedent"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704095246/http://www.law.gmu.edu/gmulawreview/issues/14-2/documents/SINCLAIR.pdf |date=2007-07-04 }}, ''George Mason Law Review'' (14 Geo. Mason L. Rev. 363) (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; or alternatively, to express a belief, or a critique of that belief, that some decisions should not be overturned.

In 1976, [[Richard Posner]] and William Landes coined the term "super-precedent" in an article they wrote about testing theories of precedent by counting citations.&lt;ref&gt;Landes, William &amp; Posner, Richard. "Legal Precedent: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis", 19 ''Journal of Law and Economics'' 249, 251 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; Posner and Landes used this term to describe the influential effect of a cited decision. The term "super-precedent" later became associated with different issue: the difficulty of overturning a decision.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Allison. [http://www.cato.org/pubs/scr/2006/hayward.pdf The Per Curiam Opinion of Steel: Buckley v. Valeo as Superprecedent?], ''Cato Supreme Court Review'' 195, 202, (2005-2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Rutgers professor Earl Maltz criticized the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' for endorsing the idea that if one side can take control of the Court on an issue of major national importance (as in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''), that side can protect its position from being reversed "by a kind of super-stare decisis".&lt;ref&gt;Maltz, Earl. "Abortion, Precedent, and the Constitution: A Comment on Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey", 68 ''Notre Dame L. Rev.'' 11 (1992), quoted by Rosen, Jeffrey.[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/30/weekinreview/30rosen.html? So, Do You Believe in 'Superprecedent'?], ''New York Times'' (2005-10-30).&lt;/ref&gt; The controversial idea that some decisions are virtually immune from being overturned, regardless of whether they were decided correctly in the first place, is the idea to which the term "super-''stare decisis''" now usually refers.

The concept of super-''stare decisis'' (or "super-precedent") was mentioned during the interrogations of Chief Justice [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]] and Justice [[Samuel Alito]] before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Prior to the commencement of the Roberts hearings, the chair of that committee, Senator [[Arlen Specter]] of Pennsylvania, wrote an op/ed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' referring to ''Roe'' as a "super-precedent". He revisited this concept during the hearings, but neither Roberts nor Alito endorsed the term or the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Benac, Nancy |url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0913-09.htm |title=Roberts Repeatedly Dodges Roe v.

===Persuasive precedent===

'''Persuasive precedent''' (also '''persuasive authority''') is precedent or other legal writing that is not [[binding precedent]] but that is useful or relevant and that may guide the judge in making the decision in a current case. Persuasive precedent includes cases decided by lower courts, by peer or higher courts from other geographic jurisdictions, cases made in other parallel systems (for example, military courts, administrative courts, indigenous/tribal courts, state courts versus federal courts in the United States), statements made in [[dicta]], [[treatises]] or academic [[law reviews]], and in some exceptional circumstances, cases of other nations, treaties, world judicial bodies, etc.

In a "[[Precedent#Matter of first impression|case of first impression]]", courts often rely on persuasive precedent from courts in other [[jurisdiction]]s that have previously dealt with similar issues. Persuasive precedent may become binding through its adoption by a higher court.

In [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[legal pluralism|pluralist]] systems, as under [[Scots law]], precedent is not binding but [[case law]] is taken into account by the courts.

====Lower courts====

A lower court's opinion may be considered as persuasive authority if the judge believes they have applied the correct legal principle and reasoning.

====Higher courts in other circuits====
A court may consider the ruling of a higher court that is not binding. For example, a [[United States district court|district court]] in the United States First Circuit could consider a ruling made by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] as persuasive authority.

====Horizontal courts====
Courts may consider rulings made in other courts that are of equivalent authority in the legal system. For example, an [[appellate court]] for one district could consider a ruling issued by an appeals court in another district.

====Statements made in ''obiter dicta''====

Courts may consider ''[[obiter dicta]]'' in opinions of higher courts. Dicta of a higher court, though not binding, will often be persuasive to lower courts.  The phrase ''obiter dicta'' is usually translated as "other things said", but due to the high number of judges and individual concurring opinions, it is often hard to distinguish from the ''ratio decidendi'' (reason for the decision).  For these reasons, the obiter dicta may often be taken into consideration by a court.  A litigant may also consider ''obiter dicta'' if a court has previously signaled&lt;ref&gt;Coale &amp; Couture, [http://600camp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Loud-Rules.pdf Loud Rules], 34 Pepperdine L. Rev. 3 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; that a particular legal argument is weak and may even warrant sanctions if repeated.

====Dissenting opinions====
A case decided by a multijudge panel could result in a split decision. While only the majority opinion is considered precedential, an outvoted judge can still publish a dissenting opinion.  Common patterns for dissenting opinions include:
* an explanation of how the outcome of the case might be different on slightly different facts, in an attempt to limit the holding of the majority
* planting seeds for a future overruling of the majority opinion
A judge in a subsequent case, particularly in a different jurisdiction, could find the dissenting judge's reasoning persuasive. In the jurisdiction of the original decision, however, a judge should only overturn the holding of a court lower or equivalent in the hierarchy. A district court, for example, could not rely on a [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] dissent as a basis to depart from the reasoning of the majority opinion.  However, lower courts occasionally cite dissents, either for a limiting principle on the majority, or for propositions that are not stated in the majority opinion and not inconsistent with that majority, or to explain a disagreement with the majority and to urge reform (while following the majority in the outcome).

====Treatises, restatements, law review articles====
Courts may consider the writings of eminent legal scholars in treatises, restatements of the law, and law reviews. The extent to which judges find these types of writings persuasive will vary widely with elements such as the reputation of the author and the relevance of the argument.

====Persuasive effect of decisions from other jurisdictions====
The courts of England and Wales are free to consider decisions of other jurisdictions, and give them whatever persuasive weight the English court sees fit, even though these other decisions are not binding precedent.  Jurisdictions that are closer to modern English [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law]] are more likely to be given persuasive weight (for example Commonwealth states such as Canada, Australia, or New Zealand).  Persuasive weight might be given to other common law courts, such as from the United States, most often where the American courts have been particularly innovative, e.g. in [[product liability]] and certain areas of [[contract]] law.

In the United States, in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the concept of a U.S. court considering foreign law or precedent has been considered controversial by some parties. The Supreme Court splits on this issue. This critique is recent, as in the early history of the United States, citation of English authority was ubiquitous. One of the first acts of many of the new state legislatures was to adopt the body of English common law into the law of the state.  See [[Common law#CL Reception Statutes|here]].  Citation to English cases was common through the 19th and well into the 20th centuries.  Even in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, it is relatively uncontroversial for American state courts to rely on English decisions for matters of pure common (i.e. judge-made) law. {{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Within the federal legal systems of several common-law countries, and most especially the United States, it is relatively common for the distinct lower-level judicial systems (e.g. state courts in the United States and Australia, provincial courts in Canada) to regard the decisions of other jurisdictions within the same country as persuasive precedent. Particularly in the United States, the adoption of a legal doctrine by a large number of other state judiciaries is regarded as highly persuasive evidence that such doctrine is preferred. A good example is the adoption in Tennessee of [[comparative negligence]] (replacing [[contributory negligence]] as a complete bar to recovery) by the 1992 [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] decision ''[[McIntyre v. Balentine]]'' (by this point all US jurisdictions save Tennessee, five other states, and the District of Columbia had adopted comparative negligence schemes). Moreover, in American law, the [[Erie doctrine|''Erie'' doctrine]] requires federal courts sitting in [[diversity jurisdiction|diversity actions]] to apply state substantive law, but in a manner consistent with how the court believes the state's highest court would rule in that case. Since such decisions are not binding on state courts, but are often very well-reasoned and useful, state courts cite federal interpretations of state law fairly often as persuasive precedent, although it is also fairly common for a state high court to reject a federal court's interpretation of its jurisprudence.

Nonpublication of opinions, or unpublished opinions, are those decisions of courts that are not available for citation as precedent because the judges making the opinion deem the cases as having less precedential value. Selective publication is the legal process which a judge or justices of a court decide whether a decision is to be or not published in [[law reports|a reporter]]. "Unpublished" federal appellate decisions are published in the [[Federal Appendix]]. Depublication is the power of a court to make a previously published order or opinion unpublished.

[[Litigation]] that is settled out of court generates no written decision, thus has no precedential effect.  As one practical effect, the U.S. Department of Justice settles many cases against the federal government simply to avoid creating adverse precedent.

===''Res judicata'', claim preclusion, collateral estoppel, issue preclusion, law of the case===

Several rules may cause a decision to apply as narrow "precedent" to preclude future legal positions of the specific parties to a case, even if a decision is non-precedential with respect to all other parties.

====''Res judicata'', claim preclusion====

{{main|res judicata}}

Once a case is decided, the same plaintiff cannot sue the same defendant again on any claim arising out of the same facts.  The law requires plaintiffs to put all issues on the table in a single case, not split the case.  For example, in a case of an auto accident, the plaintiff cannot sue first for property damage, and then personal injury in a separate case.  This is called ''[[res judicata]]'' or [[claim preclusion]] ("'Res judicata'" is the traditional name going back centuries; the name shifted to "claim preclusion" in the United States over the late 20th century).  Claim preclusion applies regardless of the plaintiff wins or loses the earlier case, even if the later case raises a different legal theory, even the second claim is unknown at the time of the first case.  Exceptions are extremely limited, for example if the two claims for relief must necessarily be brought in different courts (for example, one claim might be exclusively federal, and the other exclusively state).

====Collateral estoppel, issue preclusion====

{{main|Collateral estoppel}}

Once a case is finally decided, any issues decided in the previous case may be binding against the party who lost the issue in later cases, even in cases involving other parties.  For example, if a first case decides that a party was negligent, then other plaintiffs may rely on that earlier determination in later cases, and need not reprove the issue of negligence.  For another example, if a patent is shown to be invalid in a case against one accused infringer, that same patent is invalid against all other accused infringers—invalidity need not be reproven.  Again,  limits and exceptions on this principle exist.  The principle is called [[collateral estoppel]] or [[issue preclusion]].

====law of the case====

{{main|law of the case}}

Within a single case, once there's been a first appeal, both the lower court and the appellate court itself will not further review the same issue, and will not re-review an issue that could have been appealed in the first appeal.  Exceptions are limited to three "exceptional circumstances:" (1) when substantially different evidence is raised at a subsequent trial, (2) when the law changes after the first appeal, for example by a decision of a higher court, or (3) when a decision is clearly erroneous and would result in a manifest injustice.  This principle is called "[[law of the case]]".

===Splits, tensions===

On many questions, reasonable people may differ.  When two of those people are judges, the tension among two lines of precedent may be resolved as follows.

====Jurisdictional splits: disagreements among different geographical regions or levels of federalism====

If the two courts are in separate, parallel jurisdictions, there is no conflict, and two lines of precedent may persist.  Courts in one jurisdiction are influenced by decisions in others, and notably better rules may be adopted over time.

====Splits among different areas of law====

Courts try to formulate the common law as a "seamless web" so that principles in one area of the law apply to other areas.  However, this principle does not apply uniformly.  Thus, a word may have different definitions in different areas of the law, or different rules may apply so that a question has different answers in different legal contexts.  Judges try to minimize these conflicts, but they arise from time to time, and under principles of 'stare decisis', may persist for some time.

====Conflicts====

===Matter of first impression===
A matter of first impression (also known as an "issue of first impression," "case of first impression," or, in [[Latin language|Latin]], as ''primae impressionis'') is an issue where the parties disagree on what the applicable law is, and there is no prior [[binding authority]], so that the matter has to be decided for the first time.  A first impression case may be a first impression in only a particular [[jurisdiction]].

By definition, a case of first impression cannot be decided by precedent.  Since there is no precedent for the court to follow, the court uses the plain language and [[legislative history]] of any statute that must be interpreted, [[judicial holding|holdings]] of other jurisdictions, [[persuasive authority]] and analogies from prior rulings by other courts (which may be higher, peers, or lower courts in the hierarchy, or from other jurisdictions), commentaries and articles by legal scholars, and the court's own logic and sense of justice.

==Contrasting role of case law in common law, civil law, and mixed systems {{Anchor|Precedent_in_civil_law}} ==

The different roles of case law in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law]] traditions create differences in the way that courts render decisions. Common law courts generally explain in detail the legal rationale behind their decisions, with citations of both legislation and previous relevant judgments, and often an exegesis of the wider legal principles. These are called ''[[ratio decidendi]]'' and constitute a precedent binding on other courts; further analyses not strictly necessary to the determination of the current case are called ''[[obiter dicta]]'', which have [[persuasive authority]] but are not technically binding. By contrast, decisions in civil law jurisdictions are generally very short, referring only to [[statute]]s. The reason for this difference is that these civil law jurisdictions apply legislative positivism — a form of extreme [[legal positivism]] — which holds that legislation is the only valid source of law because it has been voted on democratically; thus, it is not the judiciary's role to create law, but rather to interpret and apply statute, and therefore their decisions must reflect that.

===Civil law systems===

''Stare decisis'' is not usually a doctrine used in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, because it violates the legislative positivist principle that only the legislature may make law. Instead, the civil law system relies on the doctrine of ''[[jurisprudence constante]]'', according to which if a court has adjudicated a consistent line of cases that arrive at the same [[Holding (law)|holdings]] using sound reasoning, then the previous decisions are highly persuasive but not controlling on issues of law. This doctrine is similar to ''stare decisis'' insofar as it dictates that a court's decision must condone a cohesive and predictable result. In theory, lower courts are generally not bound by the precedents of higher courts. In practice, the need for predictability means that lower courts generally defer to the precedent of higher courts. As a result, the precedent of courts of last resort, such as the French [[Court of Cassation (France)|Cassation Court]] and the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]], is recognized as being ''de facto'' binding on lower courts.

The doctrine of ''jurisprudence constante'' also influences how court decisions are structured. In general, court decisions of [[common law]] jurisdictions give a sufficient ''ratio decidendi'' as to guide future courts. The ratio is used to justify a court decision on the basis of previous case law as well as to make it easier to use the decision as a precedent for future cases. By contrast, court decisions in some civil law jurisdictions (most prominently [[France]]) tend to be extremely brief, mentioning only the relevant legislation and codal provisions and not going into the ''ratio decidendi'' in any great detail. This is the result of the legislative positivist view that the court is only interpreting the legislature's intent and therefore detailed exposition is unnecessary. Because of this, ''ratio decidendi'' is carried out by legal academics (doctrinal writers) who provide the explanations that in [[common law]] jurisdictions would be provided by the judges themselves.

In other civil law jurisdictions, such as the German-speaking countries, ''ratio decidendi'' tend to be much more developed than in France, and courts will frequently cite previous cases and doctrinal writers. However, some courts (such as [[Germany|German]] courts) have less emphasis on the particular facts of the case than [[common law]] courts, but have more emphasis on the discussion of various doctrinal arguments and on finding what the correct interpretation of the law is.

The mixed systems of the [[Nordic countries]] are sometimes considered a branch of the civil law, but they are sometimes counted as separate from the civil law tradition. In [[Sweden]], for instance, case law arguably plays a more important role than in some of the continental civil law systems. The two highest courts, the [[Supreme Court of Sweden|Supreme Court]] (''Högsta domstolen'') and the [[Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden|Supreme Administrative Court]] (''Högsta förvaltningsdomstolen''), have the right to set precedent which has persuasive authority on all future application of the law. Appellate courts, be they judicial (''hovrätter'') or administrative (''kammarrätter''), may also issue decisions that act as guides for the application of the law, but these decisions are persuasive, not controlling, and may therefore be overturned by higher courts.

===Mixed or bijuridical systems===

Some [[legal pluralism|mixed]] systems, such as [[Scots law]] in [[Scotland]], [[Law of South Africa|South-African law]], and the law of [[Quebec]] and [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana]], do not fit into the civil vs. common law dichotomy because they mix portions of both. Such systems may have been heavily influenced by the [[common law]] tradition; however, their private law is firmly rooted in the civil law tradition. Because of their position between the two main systems of law, these types of legal systems are sometimes referred to as "mixed" systems of law. Louisiana courts, for instance, operate under both ''stare decisis'' and ''jurisprudence constante''. In South Africa, the precedent of higher courts is absolutely or fully binding on lower courts, whereas the precedent of lower courts only has persuasive authority on higher courts; horizontally, precedent is ''prima facie'' or presumptively binding between courts.

===Role of academics in civil law jurisdictions===

Law [[professor]]s in [[common law]] traditions play a much smaller role in developing case law than professors in civil law traditions. Because court decisions in civil law traditions are brief and not amenable to establishing precedent, much of the exposition of the law in civil law traditions is done by academics rather than by judges; this is called [[doctrine]] and may be published in treatises or in journals such as ''[[Recueil Dalloz]]'' in France. Historically, [[common law]] courts relied little on legal scholarship; thus, at the turn of the twentieth century, it was very rare to see an academic writer quoted in a legal decision (except perhaps for the academic writings of prominent judges such as [[Edward Coke|Coke]] and [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]]). Today academic writers are often cited in legal argument and decisions as [[persuasive authority]]; often, they are cited when judges are attempting to implement reasoning that other courts have not yet adopted, or when the judge believes the academic's restatement of the law is more compelling than can be found in precedent. Thus [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law]] systems are adopting one of the approaches long common in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions.

==Critical analysis==

===Court formulations===

Justice Louis Brandeis, in a heavily footnoted dissent to ''Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.'', {{law report|285|U.S.|393}}, 405–411 (1932), explained (citations and quotations omitted):

:''Stare decisis'' is not ... a universal, inexorable command. "The rule of ''stare decisis'', though one tending to consistency and uniformity of decision, is not inflexible. Whether it shall be followed or departed from is a question entirely within the discretion of the court, which is again called upon to consider a question once decided."  ''Stare decisis'' is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right. This is commonly true even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation. But in cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier decisions. The Court bows to the lessons of experience and the force of better reasoning, recognizing that the process of trial and error, so fruitful in the physical sciences, is appropriate also in the judicial function. ... In cases involving the Federal Constitution the position of this Court is unlike that of the highest court of England, where the policy of ''stare decisis'' was formulated and is strictly applied to all classes of cases. Parliament is free to correct any judicial error; and the remedy may be promptly invoked.

:The reasons why this Court should refuse to follow an earlier constitutional decision which it deems erroneous are particularly strong where the question presented is one of applying, as distinguished from what may accurately be called interpreting, the Constitution. In the cases which now come before us there is seldom any dispute as to the interpretation of any provision. The controversy is usually over the application to existing conditions of some well-recognized constitutional limitation. This is strikingly true of cases under the due process clause when the question is whether a statute is unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious; of cases under the equal protection clause when the question is whether there is any reasonable basis for the classification made by a statute; and of cases under the commerce clause when the question is whether an admitted burden laid by a statute upon interstate commerce is so substantial as to be deemed direct. ...

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] has stated:

:A judicial precedent attaches a specific legal consequence to a detailed set of facts in an adjudged case or judicial decision, which is then considered as furnishing the rule for the determination of a subsequent case involving identical or similar material facts and arising in the same court or a lower court in the judicial hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;''Allegheny General Hospital v. NLRB'', 608 F.2d 965, 969-970 (3rd Cir. 1979) (footnote omitted), as quoted in ''United States Internal Revenue Serv. v. Osborne (In re Osborne)'', 76 F.3d 306, 96-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,185 (9th Cir. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] has stated:

:Stare decisis is the policy of the court to stand by precedent; the term is but an abbreviation of ''stare decisis et non quieta movere'' — "to stand by and adhere to decisions and not disturb what is settled". Consider the word "decisis". The word means, literally and legally, the decision. Under the doctrine of ''stare decisis'' a case is important only for what it decides — for the "what", not for the "why", and not for the "how". Insofar as precedent is concerned, ''stare decisis'' is important only for the decision, for the detailed legal consequence following a detailed set of facts.&lt;ref&gt;''United States Internal Revenue Serv. v. Osborne (In re Osborne)'', 76 F.3d 306, 96-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,185 (9th Cir. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael McHugh (judge)|Justice McHugh]] of the [[High Court of Australia]] in relation to precedents remarked in ''Perre v Apand'':
:[T]hat is the way of the [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law]], the judges preferring to go 'from case to case, like the ancient Mediterranean mariners, hugging the coast from point to point, and avoiding the dangers of the open sea of system or science.

===Academic study===
Precedent viewed against passing time can serve to establish trends, thus indicating the next logical step in evolving interpretations of the law. For instance, if immigration has become more and more restricted under the law, then the next legal decision on that subject may serve to restrict it further still.  The existence of submerged precedent (reasoned opinions not made available through conventional legal research sources) has been identified as a potentially distorting force in the evolution of law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2203392## Elizabeth Y. McCuskey, Clarity and Clarification: Grable Federal Questions in the Eyes of Their Beholders, 91 NEB. L. REV. 387, 427-430 (2012)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have recently attempted to apply [[network theory]] to precedent in order to establish which precedent is most important or authoritative, and how the court's interpretations and priorities have changed over time.&lt;ref&gt;[[James H. Fowler]] and Sangick Jeon, "The Authority of Supreme Court Precedent," Social Networks (2007), {{doi|10.1016/j.socnet.2007.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

===Development===
Early English [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law]] did not have or require the ''stare decisis'' doctrine for a range of legal and technological reasons:
*During the formative period of the [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law]], the royal courts constituted only one among many fora in which in the English could settle their disputes. The royal courts operated alongside and in competition with ecclesiastic, manorial, urban, mercantile, and local courts.
*Royal courts were not organised into a hierarchy, instead different royal courts (exchequer, common pleas, king's bench, and chancery) were in competition with each other.
*Substantial law on almost all matters was neither legislated nor codified, eliminating the need for courts to interpret legislation.
*Common law's main distinctive features and focus were not substantial law, which was customary law, but procedural.
*The practice of citing previous cases was not to find binding legal rules but as evidence of custom.
*Customary law was not a rational and consistent body of rules and does not require a system of binding precedent.
*Before the printing press, the state of the written records of cases rendered the ''stare decisis'' doctrine utterly impracticable.

These features changed over time, opening the door to the doctrine of ''stare decisis'':
{{quote| By the end of the eighteenth century, the [[common law]] courts had absorbed most of the business of their nonroyal competitors, although there was still internal competition among the different [[common law]] courts themselves. During the nineteenth century, legal reform movements in both England and the United States brought this to an end as well by merging the various [[common law]] courts into a unified system of courts with a formal hierarchical structure. This and the advent of reliable private case reporters made adherence to the doctrine of ''stare decisis'' practical and the practice soon evolved of holding judges to be bound by the decisions of courts of superior or equal status in their jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=HAYEK, THE COMMON LAW, AND FLUID DRIVE|first= John |last=Hasnas|publisher= NYU Journal of Law &amp; Liberty |volume =1| pages= 92–93|url=http://faculty.msb.edu/hasnasj/GTWebSite/NYUFinal.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===United States legal system===

''Stare decisis'' applies to the [[Holding (law)|holding]] of a case, rather than to [[obiter dicta]] ("things said by the way"). As the [[United States Supreme Court]] has put it: "dicta may be followed if sufficiently persuasive but are not binding."&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/99-859.html Central ''Green Co. v. United States''], 531 U.S. 425 (2001), quoting ''Humphrey's Executor v. United States'', 295 U. S. 602, 627 (1935).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States Supreme Court, the principle of stare decisis is most flexible in constitutional cases:

{{quote|Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right. ... But in cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier decisions. ... This is strikingly true of cases under the due process clause.|sign=''Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.'', 285 U.S. 393, 406–407, 410 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=285&amp;invol=393 |title=FindLaw &amp;#124; Cases and Codes |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

For example, in the years 1946–1992, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed itself in about 130 cases.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Research Service,[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/html/scourt.html Supreme Court Decisions Overruled by Subsequent Decision] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113032452/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/html/scourt.html |date=2012-01-13 }} (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Supreme Court has further explained as follows:

{{quote|[W]hen convinced of former error, this Court has never felt constrained to follow precedent. In constitutional questions, where correction depends upon amendment, and not upon legislative action, this Court throughout its history has freely exercised its power to reexamine the basis of its constitutional decisions.|sign=''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'', 321 U.S. 649, 665 (1944).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=search&amp;court=US&amp;case=/us/321/649.html |title=FindLaw &amp;#124; Cases and Codes |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The United States Supreme Court has stated that where a court gives multiple reasons for a given result, each alternative reason that is "explicitly" labeled by the court as an "independent" ground for the decision is not treated as "simply a dictum".&lt;ref&gt;See ''O'Gilvie v. United States'', 519 U.S. 79, 84 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

===English legal system===
The doctrine of binding precedent or ''stare decisis'' is basic to the English legal system. Special features of the English legal system include the following:

====The Supreme Court's ability to override its own precedent ====
The British [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], as the court of last appeal outside Scotland before it was replaced by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court]], was not strictly bound to always follow its own decisions until the case ''[[London Street Tramways v London County Council]] [1898] AC 375''. After this case, once the Lords had given a ruling on a point of law, the matter was closed unless and until Parliament made a change by statute. This is the most strict form of the doctrine of ''stare decisis'' (one not applied, previously, in [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law]] jurisdictions, where there was somewhat greater flexibility for a court of last resort to review its own precedent).

This situation changed, however, after the issuance of the [[Practice Statement]] of 1966. It enabled the House of Lords to adapt English law to meet changing social conditions. In ''R v G &amp; R'' 2003, the House of Lords overruled its decision in ''Caldwell'' 1981, which had allowed the Lords to establish [[mens rea]] ("guilty mind") by measuring a defendant's conduct against that of a "reasonable person," regardless of the defendant's actual state of mind.

However, the Practice Statement has been seldom applied by the House of Lords, usually only as a last resort. As of 2005, the House of Lords has rejected its past decisions no more than 20 times.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} They are reluctant to use it because they fear to introduce uncertainty into the law. In particular, the Practice Statement stated that the Lords would be especially reluctant to overrule themselves in criminal cases because of the importance of certainty of that law. The first case involving criminal law to be overruled with the Practice Statement was ''[[Anderton v Ryan]]'' (1985), which was overruled by ''[[R v Shivpuri]]'' (1986), two decades after the Practice Statement. Remarkably, the precedent overruled had been made only a year before, but it had been criticised by several academic lawyers. As a result, [[Lord Bridge]] stated he was "undeterred by the consideration that the decision in ''Anderton v Ryan'' was so recent. The Practice Statement is an effective abandonment of our pretension to infallibility. If a serious error embodied in a decision of this House has distorted the law, the sooner it is corrected the better."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Jacqueline (2005). ''The English Legal System'' (4th ed.), p. 25. London: Hodder Arnold. {{ISBN|0-340-89991-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the House of Lords has remained reluctant to overrule itself in some cases; in ''R v Kansal'' (2002), the majority of House members adopted the opinion that ''R v Lambert'' had been wrongly decided and agreed to depart from their earlier decision.

====Distinguishing precedent on legal (rather than fact) grounds====
A precedent does not bind a court if it finds there was a lack of care in the original "Per Incuriam". For example, if a statutory provision or precedent had not been brought to the previous court's attention before its decision, the precedent would not be binding.

==Rules of statutory interpretation==
{{Main|Statutory interpretation}}

One of the most important roles of precedent is to resolve ambiguities in other legal texts, such as constitutions, statutes, and regulations.  The process involves, first and foremost, consultation of the plain language of the text, as enlightened by the legislative history of enactment, subsequent precedent, and experience with various interpretations of similar texts.

===Statutory interpretation in the U.K.===
A judge's normal aids include access to all previous cases in which a precedent has been set, and a good English dictionary.

Judges and barristers in the U.K use three primary rules for interpreting the law.

Under the [[literal rule]], the judge should do what the actual legislation states rather than trying to do what the judge thinks that it means. The judge should use the plain everyday ordinary meaning of the words, even if this produces an unjust or undesirable outcome. A good example of problems with this method is ''R v Maginnis'' (1987),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1987/4.html]&lt;/ref&gt; in which several judges in separate opinions found several different dictionary meanings of the word ''supply''. Another example is ''[[Fisher v Bell]]'', where it was held that a shopkeeper who placed an illegal item in a shop window with a price tag did not make an offer to sell it, because of the specific meaning of "offer for sale" in [[contract law]]. As a result of this case, Parliament amended the statute concerned to end this discrepancy.

The [[golden rule (law)|golden rule]] is used when use of the literal rule would obviously create an absurd result. There are two ways in which the golden rule can be applied: a narrow method, and a broad method. Under the narrow method, when there are apparently two contradictory meanings to the wording of a legislative provision, or the wording is ambiguous, the least absurd is to be preferred. Under the broad method, the court modifies the literal meaning in such a way as to avoid the absurd result.&lt;ref name="Lawade"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lawade.com/the-english-legal-system/statutory-interpretation/the-golden-rule/ |title=The Golden Rule |website=Lawade.com |access-date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the latter approach is ''Adler v George'' (1964). Under the Official Secrets Act 1920 it was an offence to obstruct HM Forces "in the vicinity of" a prohibited place. Adler argued that he was not in the ''vicinity'' of such a place but was actually ''in'' it. The court chose not to read the statutory wording in a literal sense to avoid what would otherwise be an absurd result, and Adler was convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part E - The rules of statutory interpretation - The golden rule|url=http://labspace.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=415851|publisher=Labspace|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mischief rule]] is the most flexible of the interpretation methods. Stemming from ''[[Heydon's Case]]'' (1584), it allows the court to enforce what the statute is intended to remedy rather than what the words actually say. For example, in ''Corkery v Carpenter'' (1950), a man was found guilty of being drunk in charge of a carriage, although in fact he only had a bicycle.

===Statutory Interpretation in the United States===
In the United States, the courts have stated consistently that the text of the statute is read as it is written, using the ordinary meaning of the words of the statute.
*"[I]n interpreting a statute a court should always turn to one cardinal canon before all others. ... [C]ourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there." ''Connecticut Nat'l Bank v. Germain'', [[Case citation|112 S. Ct. 1146, 1149]] (1992). Indeed, "[w]hen the words of a statute are unambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last: 'judicial inquiry is complete.' "
*"A fundamental rule of statutory construction requires that every part of a statute be presumed to have some effect, and not be treated as meaningless unless absolutely necessary." ''Raven Coal Corp. v. Absher'', [[Case citation|153 Va. 332]], 149 S.E. 541 (1929).
*"In assessing statutory language, unless words have acquired a peculiar meaning, by virtue of statutory definition or judicial construction, they are to be construed in accordance with their common usage." ''Muller v. BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc.'', [http://www.leagle.com/decision/19961706923P2d783_11695.xml/MULLER%20v.%20BP%20EXPLORATION%20(ALASKA)%20INC. 923 P.2d 783], 787–88 (Alaska 1996).

However, most legal texts have some lingering ambiguity—inevitably, situations arise in which the words chosen by the legislature do not address the precise facts in issue, or there is some tension among two or more statutes.  In such cases, a court must analyze the various available sources, and reach a resolution of the ambiguity.  The "Canons of statutory construction" are discussed in a [[Statutory interpretation|separate article]].  Once the ambiguity is resolved, that resolution has binding effect as described in the rest of this article.

==Practical application==
Although inferior courts are bound in theory by superior court precedent, in practice a judge may believe that justice requires an outcome at some variance with precedent, and may distinguish the facts of the individual case on reasoning that does not appear in the binding precedent.  On appeal, the appellate court may either adopt the new reasoning, or reverse on the basis of precedent.  On the other hand, if the losing party does not appeal (typically because of the cost of the appeal), the lower court decision may remain in effect, at least as to the individual parties.

===Judicial resistance===
Occasionally, a lower court judge explicitly states personal disagreement with the judgment he or she has rendered, but that he or she is required to do so by [[binding precedent]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1195909351234664885 ''State Oil Co. v. Khan''], 93 F.3d 1358 (7th Cir. 1996), in which Judge Richard Posner followed the applicable Supreme Court precedent, while harshly criticizing it, which led the Supreme Court to overrule that precedent in ''[[State Oil Co. v. Khan]]'', 522 U.S. 3 (1997); see also the concurring opinion of Chief Judge Walker in [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1895782534423575000 ''National Abortion Federation v. Gonzalez''], 437 F. 3d 278 (2d Cir. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Note that inferior courts cannot evade binding precedent of superior courts, but a court can depart from its own prior decisions.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=502&amp;invol=197 ''Hilton vs. Carolina Pub. Rys. Comm'n.''], 502 U.S. 197, 202, 112 S. Ct. 560, 565 (1991)("we will not depart from the doctrine of stare decisis without some compelling justification").&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural considerations===
In the United States, ''stare decisis'' can interact in counterintuitive ways with the federal and [[U.S. state|state]] court systems. On an issue of federal law, a state court is not bound by an interpretation of federal law at the district or circuit level, but is bound by an interpretation by the United States Supreme Court. On an interpretation of state law, whether [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law]] or [[statutory law]], the federal courts are bound by the interpretation of a state court of last resort, and are required normally to defer to the precedent of intermediate state courts as well{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.

Courts may choose to obey precedent of international jurisdictions, but this is not an application of the doctrine of ''stare decisis'', because foreign decisions are not binding. Rather, a foreign decision that is obeyed on the basis of the soundness of its reasoning will be called ''[[persuasive authority]]'' — indicating that its effect is limited to the persuasiveness of the reasons it provides.

===Originalism===
[[Originalism]] is an approach to interpretation of a legal text in which controlling weight is given to the intent of the original authors (at least the intent as inferred by a modern judge).  In contrast, a non-originalist looks at other cues to meaning, including the current meaning of the words, the pattern and trend of other judicial decisions, changing context and improved scientific understanding, observation of practical outcomes and "what works," contemporary standards of justice, and ''stare decisis''.  Both are directed at ''interpreting'' the text, not changing it—interpretation is the process of resolving ambiguity and choosing from among possible meanings, not changing the text.

The two approaches look at different sets of underlying facts that may or may not point in the same direction--''stare decisis'' gives most weight to the newest understanding of a legal text, while originalism gives most weight to the oldest.  While they don't necessarily reach different results in every case, the two approaches are in direct tension. Originalists such as Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] argue that "''Stare decisis'' is not usually a doctrine used in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, because it violates the principle that only the legislature may make law."&lt;ref&gt;''A Matter of Interpretation''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Justice Scalia argues that America is a civil law nation, not a [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law]] nation. By principle, originalists are generally unwilling to defer to precedent when precedent seems to come into conflict with the originalist's own interpretation of the [[US Constitution|Constitutional]] text or inferences of original intent (even in situations where there is no original source statement of that original intent). However, there is still room within an originalist paradigm for ''stare decisis''; whenever the [[plain meaning rule|plain meaning]] of the text has alternative constructions, past precedent is generally considered a valid guide, with the qualifier being that it cannot change what the text actually says.

Originalists vary in the degree to which they defer to precedent. In his confirmation hearings, Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] answered a question from Senator [[Strom Thurmond]], qualifying his willingness to change precedent in this way:

{{quote|I think overruling a case or reconsidering a case is a very serious matter. Certainly, you would have to be of the view that a case is incorrectly decided, but I think even that is not adequate. There are some cases that you may not agree with that should not be overruled. Stare decisis provides continuity to our system, it provides predictability, and in our process of case-by-case decision-making, I think it is a very important and critical concept. A judge that wants to reconsider a case and certainly one who wants to overrule a case has the burden of demonstrating that not only is the case incorrect, but that it would be appropriate, in view of stare decisis, to make that additional step of overruling that case.|&lt;ref&gt;[[Clarence Thomas|Thomas, Clarence]] (1991). ''[U.S.] Senate Confirmation Hearings.'' qtd. by Jan Crawford Greenburg on [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/forum/june03/scotus_forum2.html PBS] (June 2003) Accessed 8 January 2007 UTC.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Possibly he has changed his mind, or there are a very large body of cases which merit "the additional step" of ignoring the doctrine; according to Scalia, "[[Clarence Thomas]] doesn't believe in stare decisis, period. If a constitutional line of authority is wrong, he would say, let's get it right."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ringel, Jonathan | title= Fulton County Daily Report - The Bombshell in the Clarence Thomas Biography | publisher=www.dailyreportonline.com | year=2004 | url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1090180289132 | authorlink=Jonathan Ringel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [http://www.law.virginia.edu/lawweb/Faculty.nsf/FHPbI/C4888338932C96E5852566EF00728D67?OpenDocument&amp;ExpandSection=1 Caleb Nelson], a former clerk for Justice Thomas and law professor at the University of Virginia, has elaborated on the role of ''stare decisis'' in originalist jurisprudence:

{{quote|American courts of last resort recognize a rebuttable presumption against overruling their own past decisions. In earlier eras, people often suggested that this presumption did not apply if the past decision, in the view of the court's current members, was demonstrably erroneous. But when the Supreme Court makes similar noises today, it is roundly criticized. At least within the academy, conventional wisdom now maintains that a purported demonstration of error is not enough to justify overruling a past decision. ...[T]he conventional wisdom is wrong to suggest that any coherent doctrine of stare decisis must include a presumption against overruling precedent that the current court deems demonstrably erroneous. The doctrine of stare decisis would indeed be no doctrine at all if courts were free to overrule a past decision simply because they would have reached a different decision as an original matter. But when a court says that a past decision is demonstrably erroneous, it is saying not only that it would have reached a different decision as an original matter, but also that the prior court went beyond the range of indeterminacy created by the relevant source of law. ... Americans from the Founding on believed that court decisions could help "liquidate" or settle the meaning of ambiguous provisions of written law. Later courts generally were supposed to abide by such "liquidations." ... To the extent that the underlying legal provision was determinate, however, courts were not thought to be similarly bound by precedent that misinterpreted it. ... Of the Court's current members, Justices Scalia and Thomas seem to have the most faith in the determinacy of the legal texts that come before the Court. It should come as no surprise that they also seem the most willing to overrule the Court's past decisions. ... Prominent journalists and other commentators suggest that there is some contradiction between these Justices' mantra of "judicial restraint" and any systematic re-examination of precedent. But if one believes in the determinacy of the underlying legal texts, one need not define "judicial restraint" solely in terms of fidelity to precedent; one can also speak of fidelity to the texts themselves.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Nelson, Caleb | title=Stare Decisis and Demonstrably Erroneous Precedent | publisher=Virginia Law Review, 84 Va L.

===Advantages and disadvantages===

There are disadvantages and advantages of binding precedent, as noted by scholars and jurists.

===Criticism of precedent===

In a 1997 book, attorney Michael Trotter blamed over-reliance by American lawyers on binding and persuasive authority, rather than the merits of the case at hand, as a major factor behind the escalation of [[legal costs]] during the 20th century. He argued that courts should ban the citation of persuasive precedent from outside their jurisdiction, with two exceptions:
:(1) cases where the foreign jurisdiction's law is the subject of the case, or
:(2) instances where a litigant intends to ask the highest court of the jurisdiction to overturn binding precedent, and therefore needs to cite persuasive precedent to demonstrate a trend in other jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;Michael H. Trotter, ''Profit and the Practice of Law: What's Happened to the Legal Profession'' (Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1997), 161-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

The disadvantages of ''stare decisis'' include its rigidity, the complexity of learning law, the differences between some cases may be very small and appear illogical, and the slow growth or incremental changes to the law that are in need of major overhaul.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

An argument often used against the system is that it is [[democracy|undemocratic]] as it allows judges, which may or may not be elected, to make law.&lt;ref&gt;https://isistatic.org/journal-archive/ma/14_01/mcclellan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding constitutional interpretations, there is concern that over-reliance on the doctrine of ''stare decisis'' can be subversive. An erroneous precedent may at first be only slightly inconsistent with the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]], and then this error in interpretation can be propagated and increased by further precedent until a result is obtained that is greatly different from the original understanding of the Constitution. ''Stare decisis'' is not mandated by the Constitution, and if it causes unconstitutional results then the historical evidence of original understanding can be re-examined. In this opinion, predictable fidelity to the Constitution is more important than fidelity to unconstitutional precedent. See also the [[living tree doctrine]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Agreement with precedent===

A counter-argument (in favor of the advantages of ''stare decisis'') is that if the [[legislature]] wishes to alter the case law (other than constitutional interpretations) by [[statute]], the legislature is empowered to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Berland, David (2011). Note, [http://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/ilr-content/articles/2011/2/Berland.pdf "Stopping the Pendulum: Why Stare Decisis Should Constrain the Court from Further Modification of the Search Incident to Arrest Exception"]. University of Illinois Law Review (2011 U. Ill. L. Rev. 695).&lt;/ref&gt; Critics{{who|date=April 2014}} sometimes accuse particular judges of applying the doctrine selectively, invoking it to support precedent that the judge supported anyway, but ignoring it in order to change precedent with which the judge disagreed.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

There is much discussion about the virtue of using ''stare decisis''. Supporters of the system, such as [[Minimalism (Judicial)|minimalists]], argue that obeying precedent makes decisions "predictable". For example, a business person can be reasonably assured of predicting a decision where the facts of his or her case are sufficiently similar to a case decided previously. This parallels the arguments against retroactive (ex post facto) laws banned by the U.S. Constitution.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

'''Privation''' is the absence or lack of basic necessities, such as food and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/privation |title=The Free Dictionary - Privation |accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
In psychology, privation occurs when a child has no opportunity to form a relationship with a parent figure, or when such relationship is distorted, due to their treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Angles on Applied Psychology | publisher=Nelson Thornes | year=2003 | pages=219 | isbn=978-0-7487-7259-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dbdQf0P05ZkC&amp;lpg=PA219&amp;dq=privation%20psychology&amp;pg=PA219#v=onepage&amp;q=privation%20psychology&amp;f=false | last1=Russell | first1=Julia | last2=Jarvis | first2=Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is different to [[Social deprivation|deprivation]], which occurs when an established relationship is severed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Brain |first1=Christine |last2=Mukherji |first2=Penny |title=Understanding child psychology |publisher=Nelson Thornes |edition=New |date=7 June 2005 |ISBN=978-0-7487-9084-5 |pages=44–45 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jhhYHW1ieQEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Understanding+Child+Psychology&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ztJrTvv_Cono-gaJttm4DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is understood that privation can produce social, emotional and intellectual problems for children; however, how inevitable such problems become as a result of privation, and the extent to which they can be reversed, remains an issue of debate among [[psychologist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Angles on Child Psychology | publisher=Nelson Thornes | year=2001 | pages=53 | isbn=978-0-7487-5975-0 | last1=Jarvis | first1=Matt | last2=Chandler | first2=Emma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
In philosophy, privation may refer to the absence of a necessary quality in the universe. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} &lt;!-- who gives such a definition?--&gt;

For example, as part of [[Augustinian theodicy|his theodicy]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] denied the existence of [[evil]] as its own entity; rather, he described evil as a privation, or going wrong, of good, ''[[privatio boni]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Descartes and Augustine | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2002 | author=Menn, Stephen | isbn=978-0-521-01284-3 | page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]] argued that privation is not necessarily a bad thing: it would be trivial to regard the privation of hair – [[baldness]] – as an evil.

{{Split|Property (philosophy)|Property (mathematics)|date=June 2018}}
In [[mathematics]], [[logic]], and [[philosophy]], a '''property''' is a characteristic of an [[Object (philosophy)|object]]; a red object is said to have the property of redness. The property may be considered a form of object in its own right, able to possess other properties. A property, however, differs from individual objects in that it may be [[instantiation principle|instantiated]], and often in more than one thing. It differs from the logical/mathematical concept of [[class (set theory)|class]] by not having any concept of [[extensionality]], and from the philosophical concept of [[class (philosophy)|class]] in that a property is considered to be distinct from the objects which possess it. Understanding how different individual entities (or particulars) can in some sense have some of the same properties is the basis of the [[problem of universals]]. The terms '''attribute''' and [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] have similar meanings.

==Metaphysical Debates about the Nature of Properties==
In modern [[analytic philosophy]] there are several debates about the fundamental nature of properties. These center around questions such as: Are properties real? Are they categorical or dispositional? Are properties physical or mental?
===Realism vs. Anti-Realism&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/#DisTer&lt;/ref&gt;=== 
A realist about properties asserts that properties have genuine existence. One way to spell this out is in terms of exact, repeatable, instantiations known [[universals]]. The other realist position asserts that properties are particulars(tropes), which are unique instantiations in individual objects that merely resemble one another to various degrees.

The anti-realist position, often referred to as [[nominalism]] claims that properties are names we attach to particulars. The properties themselves have no existence.

===Categoricalism vs. Dispositionalism&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/#CatProVsCauPow&lt;/ref&gt;=== 
According to the categoricalist, dispositions reduce to causal bases. The fragility of a wine glass, for example, is not a property that exists in the glass. Rather it can be explained by the categorical property of the glass's micro-structural composition.

Dispositionalism, in turn, asserts that a property is nothing more that a set of causal powers.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dispositions/#CatDisLawNat&lt;/ref&gt; Fragility, according to this view, identifies a real property of the glass (e.g. to shatter when dropped on a sufficiently hard surface).

Several intermediary positions exist.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dispositions/#CatDisLawNat&lt;/ref&gt; The Identity view that states that properties are both categorical(qualitative) and dispositional, they are just two ways of viewing the same property. One hybrid view claims that some properties are categorical and some are dispositional. A second hybrid view claims that properties have both a categorical(qualitative) and dispositional part, but that these are distinct ontological parts.

===Physicalism, Idealism, and Property dualism===
{{Main|Physicalism}}
{{Main|Idealism}}
{{Main|Property dualism}}
[[Image:Property dualism.jpg|thumb|Property dualism: the exemplification of two kinds of property by one kind of substance]] Property dualism describes a category of positions in the [[philosophy of mind]] which hold that, although the world is constituted of just one kind of [[substance theory|substance]]—the physical kind—there exist two distinct kinds of properties: [[physical properties]] and [[mental properties]]. In other words, it is the view that non-physical, mental properties (such as beliefs, desires and emotions) inhere in some physical substances (namely brains).

This stands in contrast to physicalism and idealism. Physicalism claims that all properties, include mental properties, ultimately reduce to, or supervene on, physical properties.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physicalism/&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphysical Idealism, by contrast, claims that "something mental (the mind, spirit, reason, will) is the ultimate foundation of all reality, or even exhaustive of reality."&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/idealism/#Int&lt;/ref&gt;

==Essential and accidental properties==
In classical [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] terminology, a ''property'' (Greek: ''idion'', Latin: ''proprium'') is one of the [[predicables]]. It is a non-[[essence|essential]] quality of a species (like an [[accident (philosophy)|accident]]), but a quality which is nevertheless characteristically present in members of that species. For example, "ability to laugh" may be considered a special characteristic of human beings. However, "laughter" is not an ''essential'' quality of the species ''human'', whose Aristotelian definition of "rational animal" does not require laughter. Therefore, in the classical framework, ''properties'' are characteristic qualities that are not truly required for the continued existence of an entity but are, nevertheless, possessed by the entity.

==Determinate and determinable properties==
A property may be classified as either determinate or determinable. A determinable property is one that can get more specific. For example, color is a determinable property because it can be restricted to redness, blueness, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinate-determinables/ Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy ''Determinate and Determinable Properties'']&lt;/ref&gt; A determinate property is one that cannot become more specific. This distinction may be useful in dealing with issues of [[identity (philosophy)|identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| pages = 31
| accessdate = 2008-01-28
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lovely and suspect qualities==
[[Daniel Dennett]] distinguishes between ''lovely'' properties (such as loveliness itself), which, although they
require an observer to be recognised, exist latently in perceivable objects; and ''suspect'' properties which have no existence at all until attributed by an observer (such as being suspected of a crime)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/lovely&amp;s.htm|title=Lovely and Suspect Qualities|publisher=|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties and predicates==
The ontological fact that something has a property is typically represented in language by applying a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] to a [[subject (grammar)|subject]]. However, taking any grammatical predicate whatsoever to be a property, or to have a corresponding property, leads to certain difficulties, such as [[Russell's paradox]] and the [[Grelling–Nelson paradox]]. Moreover, a real property can imply a host of true predicates: for instance, if X has the property of weighing more than 2 kilos, then the predicates "..weighs more than 1.9 kilos", "..weighs more than 1.8 kilos", etc., are all true of it. Other predicates, such as "is an individual", or "has some properties" are uninformative or vacuous. There is some resistance to regarding such so-called '''"[[Cambridge_change|Cambridge properties]]"''' as legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/existence/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Michael|last=Nelson|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2012|publisher=|accessdate=3 August 2016|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intrinsic and extrinsic properties==
{{main|Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)}}
An '''intrinsic''' property is a property that an object or a thing has of itself, independently of other things, including its context.  An '''extrinsic''' (or '''relational''') property is a property that depends on a thing's relationship with other things. The latter is sometimes also called an '''attribute''', since the value of that property is ''given'' to the object via its relation with another object. (See the [[etymology]] of the word on [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/attribute Wiktionary].) For example, [[mass]] is a physical intrinsic property of any [[Physical body|physical object]], whereas [[weight]] is an extrinsic property that varies depending on the strength of the gravitational field in which the [[respect]]ive object is placed. other examples are the ''name'' of a person (an attribute given by the person's parents) and the weight or mass of the person.

==Relations==
A relation is often considered{{by whom|date=March 2011}} to be a more general case of a property. Relations are true of several particulars, or shared amongst them. Thus the relation ".. is taller than .." holds "between" two individuals, who would occupy the two ellipses ('..'). Relations can be expressed by N-place predicates, where N is greater than 1.

It is widely accepted{{by whom|date=March 2011}} that there are at least some apparent relational properties which are merely derived from non-relational (or 1-place) properties. For instance "A is heavier than B" is a relational ''predicate'', but it is derived from the two non relational properties: the mass of A and the mass of B. Such relations are called external relations, as opposed to the more genuine internal relations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hume.ucdavis.edu/mattey/phi156/moore.pdf [[G. E. Moore|George Moore]], ''External and Internal Relations'']&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers believe that all relations are external, leading to a scepticism about relations in general, on the basis that external relations have no fundamental existence.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes called roadway powered electric vehicles) collect any form of [[potential energy]] from the road surface to supply [[electricity]] to locomotive motors and ancillary equipment within the vehicle.

==Definition==
A Road Powered [[electric vehicle]]  may be defined as a transport capsule with the following characteristics:

(1) The [[Prime mover (locomotive)|principal means of locomotion]] is one or more [[electric motor]](s)

2) The electric motors are powered by an [[electricity|electrical supply]] provided either from a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] (usually on-board) or power source (typically remote, and connected directly via conductive [[electrical cable|cable]]s or [[Inductive charging|magnetic inductive fields]]

(3) There is a defined [[road]]way over which the vehicle travels (that means, although it may have some on-board battery reserve, is not intended to be [[Off-roading|a cross country vehicle]])

(4) Where an external electric supply is provided, this is typically with [[trolleybus|overhead]] conductors or [[Third rail|above-ground rails]] or (rarely) [[Resonant inductive coupling|sub-surface electro-magnets]].

(5) An all-electric vehicle typically requires one or more [[Battery electric vehicle|on-board energy supply elements]] or devices for autonomous operation, most commonly by  [[Battery (electricity)|chemical batteries]], less frequently via [[Electrical generator|electro-mechanical generators]]

(6) The electric vehicle further may include an on-board [[control system]] that directs energy from the energy storage elements, as needed, and converts such energy to electric motors used to propel the electric vehicle.

A Road Powered Electric Vehicle therefore '''''necessarily  includes a system for supplying electricity from an external power source''''' (such as a remote [[Electricity generation|power station]]) through a network of power coupling elements which provide an integral and continuous power connection between origin and destination.

==Wireless energy transfer==

{{Main|wireless energy transfer}}

In USA Patent 6421600 these power coupling elements are electro-magnetic transmission coils embedded in the roadway and reception coils which are electrically [[resonant]], so that they convert the magnetic flux above the road into electrical energy on the vehicle, which is entirely independent, since there is no mechanical or electrical link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USA Patent 6421600 version of RPEV cited also includes:

(1) an on-board power meter to indicate the approximate consumption and an approximation of its remaining autonomous (battery) endurance or ranger range

(2) a [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|wide bandwidth]] [[Channel (communications)|communications channel]] to allow information signals to be sent to, and received from, the RPEV while it is in use;

(3) automated garaging, a system that automatically connects power to the RPEV when it is in storage overnight, both to recharge the on-board batteries and power the on-board [[storage heater]] in cold weather so that it is comfortable for the driver and passengers.

(4) electronic coupling between two or more RPEVs so that one can be a "master" (with a driver) and the following vehicle(s) are "slave" (controlled by the driver in the "master" vehicle) as a sort of "road train"  in order to increase [[passenger]] or [[cargo|payload]] capacity.

(5) a [[positioning system]] for determining the current location of the RPEV; and

(6) a scheduling and dispatch computer so that many RPEV's can be accommodated efficiently on any particular length of road with embedded transmission coils. Such a system could be adapted for use with remote drivers or automatic control over closed roadway circuits such as warehouses and theme parks.

'''[[Online Electric Vehicle]]s (OHVs)''' use pick-up equipment underneath the vehicle then collects power through non-contact magnetic induction, which may imply a similar electrical design.

==Wired energy transfer==

[[File:Tram train 1907.pdf|thumb|right|Tram and 'Trackless Car' share common overhead lines (from [[Harmsworth Popular Science]])]]
[[Trolleybuses]] use overhead cables which could also be used for cars, as shown in a photograph (right) carried by an encyclopedic magazine about 1910.

===Overhead power lines===
The twin overhead power lines are usually copper conductors with a flat surface, which are supported by a steel catenary wire. A pole or pantograph extends from the vehicle and presses 'slippers' or 'skates' against the conductors to complete the circuit. These slipper or skate contacts are frequently coated with graphite, or have a carbon block to reduce friction and ensure a good (low resistance) electrical connection.

Since buses are scheduled, traffic conflicts are rare. If the overhead dual power line infrastructure was used randomly by private users, then some sort of management system would be required. The simplest would be to provide the vehicles some limited autonomy so that they could simply disconnect when arriving at each intersection and reconnect when they joined the next section. A more sophisticated traffic management system, as proposed by USA Patent 6421600 (above) could facilitate transit where there are many vehicles wishing to draw power from a particular section of the infrastructure.

[[File:SARS RPEV.png|thumb]] [[File:CCC RPEV.png|thumb]]

Recent improvements in trolleybus design include the automatic connection and disconnection of power poles either by the driver or in the event of mechanical dis-engagement from the overhead wires, so that the driver can remain in control, using on-board battery power. Better materials and motion dynamics modeling allow speeds up to about 80&amp;nbsp;km/h so that trolleybus behavior is flexible and totally comparable with regular autonomous vehicle performance, even at crossings and road-junctions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ground-level power supply===
[[Ground-level power supply]] is an alternative to overhead power lines. The most common version is the [[conduit current collection]] system, where the power supply is carried in a channel or vault under the roadway. This is a tube, open at the top to allow a blade to enter and extend slippers against the power conductors, which are either side of the access opening slot, near the top of the channel. The arrangement is shaped so that live surfaces can not be reached by hand, and the lower part of the conduit provides drainage to remove any water.

Conduit power was first designed in the steam age (c.1900) when power was transmitted mechanically from a series of steam-powered rotating screws, as shown in the illustration (left) also published by [[Harmsworth Popular Science]].

A more recent roadway power supply design used by the [[Bordeaux tramway]] involves alternate (line and neutral) panels which are only powered whilst they are actually under the tram. This system is called APS (French: ''Alimentation par Sol'' which implies sub-surface power feed in English).

===Overhead electrical net===
'''A parking area''' with an overhead electrical net was in use at  Seoul Grand Park Zoo in South Korea, to recharge electric vehicles {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}, This was similar to a fairground [[bumper car]] arrangement which allowed vehicle batteries to be recharged, prior to introduction of the more modern OLEV [[Online Electric Vehicle]] system. The advantage was that vehicles could be parked randomly, as convenient, and there was no need for either the tripping hazard of trailing cables used by most [[electric vehicle]]s nor for fiddly precise alignment of conductor poles needed by [[trolley bus]]es.

==Linear Motor Propulsion==
{{Main|linear motor}}

An alternative form of electro-magnetic coupling is called a linear motor, first developed by Professor [[Eric Laithwaite]] at [[Imperial College London]] in the 1960s.

Instead of supplying electric motors with power directly or charging on-board batteries, the RPEV is fitted with magnets which are impelled horizontally in the same way as the rotor on an ordinary electric motor is impelled to rotate. A linear motor works in exactly the same way a round motor which has been split to its centre, laid flat and extended.

The Shanghai [[Transrapid]] and [[Bombardier Advanced Rapid Transit]] systems are practical examples of this type of RPEV technology applied to [[rail transport]] systems (which are sometimes called railroads, especially in USA).

[[Maglev]] uses magnetic repulsion to support the [[Passenger car (rail)|carriage]] weight as well as to propel the [[Rapid transit|vehicle]] forward, so wheels are not needed. Maglev  [[train]]s effectively ride on top of a magnetic wave, much as a [[surfer]] rides a wave on the sea.

The '''rural–urban fringe''', also known as the '''outskirts''', '''rurban''', '''peri-urban'''  or the '''urban hinterland''', can be described as the "'''landscape interface''' between town and country",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/index.cfm?Articleid=2803 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311091656/http://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/index.cfm?Articleid=2803 |date=March 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or also as the transition zone where urban and rural uses mix and often clash.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Michael. B., Flemming Christiansen, and Malcolm Chapman. (2010) 'Chinese Consumers: The porn Reappraisal'. ''Ethnography'', Sept 2010, 11, 331-357&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it can be viewed as a landscape type in its own right, one forged from an interaction of urban and rural land uses.

== Definition ==

Its definition shifts depending on the global location, but typically in Europe, where urban areas are intensively managed to prevent [[urban sprawl]] and protect agricultural land, the urban fringe will be characterised by certain land uses which have either purposely moved away from the urban area, or require much larger tracts of land. As examples:

* Roads, especially motorways and bypasses
* Waste transfer stations, [[recycling]] facilities and landfill sites
* [[Park and ride]] sites
* Airports
* Large hospitals
* Power, water and sewerage facilities
* Factories
* Large out-of-town shopping facilities, e.g. large supermarkets

Despite these 'urban' uses, the fringe remains largely open, with the majority of the land agricultural, woodland or other rural use. However, the quality of the countryside around urban areas tends to be low, with severance between the area of open land and bad maintained woodlands and hedgerows.

In recent years there has been a growing interest in how the full environmental and social potential of the urban fringe can be unlocked. In England in 2005, the Countryside Agency (now part of [[Natural England]]) together with Groundwork, a community and environmental regeneration body, produced a vision for the 'countryside in and around towns' that sets out ten 'functions' for a multi-functional urban fringe.&lt;ref&gt;http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/file/105001  Green Infrastructure
and the Urban Fringe: Learning lessons from the Countryside in and Around Towns Programme (Countryside Agency and Groundwork UK, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The realisation of this vision would{{Dubious|date=February 2010}} provide a high-quality environment right on the urban doorstep and provide the adjacent town or city with a host of '[[ecosystem services]]'. It is estimated{{By whom|date=February 2010}} that within England the urban fringe covers as much as 20% of the land area. Such an extensive resource must be managed and used more intelligently and sustainably if the country as a whole is to develop and function sustainably.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In the [[United States]] urban areas are defined as contiguous territory having a density of at least 1,000 persons per square mile, though in some areas the density may be as low as 500 per square mile. Urban areas also include the outlying territory of less density if it was connected to the core of the contiguous area by road and is within 2.5 road miles of that core, or within 5 road miles of the core but separated by water or other undevelopable territories. Other territory with a population density of fewer than 1,000 people per square mile is included in the urban fringe if it eliminates an enclave or closes an indentation in the boundary of the urbanized area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/fedreg/fedregv76n164.pdf| title=Urban Area Criteria for the 2010 Census; Notice| author=Department of Commerce - Census Bureau| work=Federal Register| publisher=National Archives and Records Administration| date=August 24, 2011| access-date=August 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=August 2017}}
'''Simulated reality''' is the [[hypothesis]] that [[reality]] could be simulated—for example by [[quantum computer]]  [[computer simulation|simulation]]—to a degree indistinguishable from "true" reality. It could contain conscious minds which may or may not be fully aware that they are living inside a simulation. This is quite different from the current, technologically achievable concept of [[virtual reality]]. Virtual reality is easily distinguished from the experience of actuality; participants are never in doubt about the nature of what they experience. Simulated reality, by contrast, would be hard or impossible to separate from "true" reality. There has been much debate over this topic, ranging from philosophical discourse to practical applications in [[computing]].

==Arguments==

===Simulation argument===

{{Main|Simulation hypothesis}}

A version of the simulation hypothesis was first theorised as a part of a philosophical argument on the part of [[René Descartes]], and later by [[Hans Moravec]].&lt;ref name="frc.ri.cmu.edu"&gt;Moravec, Hans, [http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1998/SimConEx.98.html Simulation, Consciousness, Existence]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moravec, Hans, Platt, Charles [https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.10/moravec.html?pg=6&amp;topic=&amp;topic_set= Superhumanism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moravec, Hans [http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1992/CyberPigs.html Pigs in Cyberspace]&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] developed an expanded argument examining the probability of our reality being a simulation.&lt;ref name="bostrom2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bostrom, Nick |journal=Philosophical Quarterly |date=2003 |volume=53 |issue=211 |pages=243-255 |url=http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html |title=Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?}}&lt;/ref&gt; His argument states that at least one of the following statements is very likely to be true:

:1. Human civilization or a comparable civilization is unlikely to reach a level of [[transhumanism|technological maturity]] capable of producing simulated realities or such simulations are physically impossible to construct.&lt;ref name="bostrom2003"/&gt;
:2. A comparable civilization reaching aforementioned technological status will likely not produce a significant number of simulated realities (one that might push the probable existence of digital entities beyond the probable number of "real" entities in a Universe) for any of a number of reasons, such as diversion of computational processing power for other tasks, ethical considerations of holding entities captive in simulated realities, etc.&lt;ref name="bostrom2003"/&gt;
:3. Any entities with our general set of experiences are almost certainly living in a simulation.&lt;ref name="bostrom2003"/&gt;
:4. We are living in a reality in which posthumans have not developed yet and we are actually living in reality.&lt;ref name="bostrom2003"/&gt;

Bostrom's argument rests on the premise that given sufficiently advanced technology, it is possible to represent the populated surface of the Earth without recourse to [[digital physics]]; that the [[qualia]] experienced by a [[simulated consciousness]] are comparable or equivalent to those of a naturally occurring human consciousness, and that one or more levels of simulation within simulations would be feasible given only a modest expenditure of computational resources in the real world.&lt;ref name="bostrom2003"/&gt;

If one assumes first that humans will not be destroyed nor destroy themselves before developing such a technology, and that human descendants will have no overriding legal restrictions or moral compunctions against simulating biospheres or their own historical biosphere, then, Bostrom argues, it would be unreasonable to count ourselves among the small minority of genuine organisms who, sooner or later, will be vastly outnumbered by artificial simulations.&lt;ref name="bostrom2003"/&gt;

[[Epistemology|Epistemologically]], it is not impossible to tell whether we are living in a simulation. For example, Bostrom suggests that a window could ''pop up'' saying: "You are living in a simulation. Click here for more information." However, imperfections in a simulated environment might be difficult for the native inhabitants to identify and for purposes of authenticity, even the simulated memory of a blatant revelation might be purged programmatically. Nonetheless, should any evidence come to light, either for or against the skeptical hypothesis, it would radically alter the aforementioned probability.&lt;ref name="bostrom2003"/&gt;

===Computationalism===
{{Main|Computationalism|Mathematical universe hypothesis}}
[[Computationalism]] is a [[philosophy of mind]] theory stating that [[cognition]] is a form of [[computation]]. It is relevant to the [[Simulation hypothesis]] in that it illustrates how a simulation could contain conscious subjects, as required by a "[[Simulated reality#Virtual people|virtual people]]" simulation. For example, it is well known that physical systems can be simulated to some degree of accuracy. If computationalism is correct and if there is no [[hard problem of consciousness|problem]] in generating [[artificial consciousness]] or cognition, it would establish the theoretical possibility of a simulated reality. Nevertheless, the relationship between cognition and phenomenal [[qualia]] of consciousness is [[chinese room|disputed]]. It is possible that [[consciousness]] requires a [[vitalism|vital substrate]] that a computer cannot provide and that simulated people, while behaving appropriately, would be [[philosophical zombie]]s. This would undermine [[Nick Bostrom]]'s simulation argument; we cannot be a simulated consciousness, if consciousness, as we know it, cannot be simulated. The skeptical hypothesis remains intact, however, and we could still be [[brain in a vat|envatted brain]]s, existing as conscious beings within a simulated environment, even if consciousness cannot be simulated. It has been suggested that whereas virtual reality would enable a participant to experience only three senses (sight, sound and optionally smell), simulated reality would enable all five (including taste and touch).{{fact|date=August 2017}}

Some theorists&lt;ref&gt;[http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/ Bruno Marchal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hpcoders.com.au/nothing.html Russel Standish]&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that if the "consciousness-is-computation" version of [[computationalism]] and [[mathematical realism]] (or radical [[mathematical Platonism]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hut |first1=P. |last2=Alford |first2=M. |last3=Tegmark |first3=M. |year=2006 |title=On Math, Matter and Mind |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=765–794 |arxiv=physics/0510188 |bibcode=2006FoPh...36..765H |doi=10.1007/s10701-006-9048-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; are true then consciousnesses is computation, which in principle is [[universal Turing machine|platform independent]] and thus admits of simulation. This argument states that a "Platonic realm" or [[ultimate ensemble]] would contain every algorithm, including those which implement consciousness. [[Hans Moravec]] has explored the simulation hypothesis and has argued for a kind of mathematical Platonism according to which every object (including, for example, a stone) can be regarded as implementing every possible computation.&lt;ref name="frc.ri.cmu.edu"/&gt;

===Dreaming===
{{Further|Dream argument}}

A dream could be considered a type of simulation capable of fooling someone who is asleep. As a result, the "dream hypothesis" cannot be ruled out, although it has been argued that [[common sense]] and considerations of [[Occam's razor|simplicity]] rule against it.&lt;ref&gt;"There is no logical impossibility in the supposition that the whole of life is a dream, in which we ourselves create all the objects that come before us. But although this is not logically impossible, there is no reason whatever to suppose that it is true; and it is, in fact, a less simple hypothesis, viewed as a means of accounting for the facts of our own life, than the common-sense hypothesis that there really are objects independent of us, whose action on us causes our sensations." [[Bertrand Russell]], ''The Problems of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the first philosophers to question the distinction between [[reality]] and [[dream]]s was [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], a [[China|Chinese]] philosopher from the 4th century BC.  He phrased the problem as the well-known "Butterfly Dream," which went as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Once Zhuangzi dreamt he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting and fluttering around, happy with himself and doing as he pleased. He didn't know he was Zhuangzi. Suddenly he woke up and there he was, solid and unmistakable Zhuangzi. But he didn't know if he was Zhuangzi who had dreamt he was a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming he was Zhuangzi. Between Zhuangzi and a butterfly there must be ''some'' distinction! This is called the Transformation of Things. (2, tr. Burton Watson 1968:49)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The philosophical underpinnings of this argument are also brought up by [[Descartes]], who was one of the first [[Western World|Western]] philosophers to do so. In ''Meditations on First Philosophy'', he states "... there are no certain indications by which we may clearly distinguish wakefulness from sleep",&lt;ref name="Des"&gt;René Descartes, Meditations on the First Philosophy, from Descartes, The Philosophical Works of Descartes, trans. Elizabeth S. Haldane and G.R.T. Ross (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1911 – reprinted with corrections 1931), Volume I, 145-46.&lt;/ref&gt; and goes on to conclude that "It is possible that I am dreaming right now and that all of my perceptions are false".&lt;ref name="Des"/&gt;

Chalmers (2003) discusses the dream hypothesis and notes that this comes in two distinct forms:
* that he is ''currently'' dreaming, in which case many of his beliefs about the world are incorrect;
* that he has ''always'' been dreaming, in which case the objects he perceives actually exist, albeit in his imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, J., [http://consc.net/papers/matrix.html The Matrix as Metaphysics], Department of Philosophy, University of Arizona&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the [[dream argument]] and the [[simulation hypothesis]] can be regarded as [[skeptical hypothesis|skeptical hypotheses]]; however in raising these doubts, just as [[Descartes]] noted that his own thinking led him to be convinced of his own existence, the existence of the argument itself is testament to the possibility of its own truth. Another state of mind in which some argue an individual's perceptions have no physical basis in the real world is called [[psychosis]] though psychosis may have a physical basis in the real world and explanations vary.

The dream hypothesis is also used to develop other philosophical concepts, such as Valberg's [[personal horizon]]: what this world would be internal to if ''this'' were all a dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Valberg|first=J.J.|title=Dream, Death, and the Self|year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691128597|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8416.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nested simulations===
The existence of simulated reality is unprovable in any concrete sense: any "evidence" that is directly observed could be another simulation itself. In other words, there is an [[infinite regress]] problem with the argument. Even if we are a simulated reality, there is no way to be sure the beings running the simulation are not themselves a simulation and the operators of ''that'' simulation are not a simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Simulation Argument: Some Explanations |first=Nick |last=Bostrom |year=2009 |url=http://www.simulation-argument.com/brueckner.pdf |quote=If each first-level ancestor-simulation run by the non-Sims requires more resources (because they contain within themselves additional second-level ancestor-simulations run by the Sims), the non-Sims might well respond by producing fewer first-level ancestor-simulations. Conversely, the cheaper it is for the non-Sims to run a simulation, the more simulations they may run. It is therefore unclear whether the total number of ancestor-simulations would be greater if Sims run ancestor-simulations than if they do not.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"{{vanchor|Recursive simulation}} involves a simulation or an entity in the simulation, creating another instance of the same simulation, running it and using its results" (Pooch and Sullivan 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=U.W. |last=Pooch |first2=F.J. |last2=Sullivan |year=2000 |url= http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/WSC.2000.899898 |journal=Simulation Conference |volume=1 |pages=958 |edition=Winter |title=Recursive simulation to aid models of decisionmaking |isbn=0-7803-6579-8 |doi=10.1109/WSC.2000.899898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses of the simulation hypothesis in philosophy===

Besides attempting to assess whether the simulation hypothesis is true or false, philosophers have also used it to illustrate other philosophical problems, especially in [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]].  [[David Chalmers]] has argued that simulated beings might wonder whether their [[Mind|mental]] lives are governed by the [[physics]] of their environment, when in fact these mental lives are simulated separately (and are thus, in fact, not governed by the simulated physics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://consc.net/notes/dualism.html|title=How Cartesian Dualism Might Have Been True|last=Chalmers|first=David|date=January 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They might eventually find that their thoughts fail to be physically [[causality|caused]].  Chalmers argues that this means that [[mind-body dualism|Cartesian dualism]] is not necessarily as problematic of a philosophical view as is commonly supposed, though he does not endorse it.

Similarly, Vincent Conitzer has used the following computer simulation scenarios to illuminate [[further facts]]—facts that do not follow logically from the physical facts—about [[qualia]] (what it is ''like'' to have specific experiences), [[indexicality]] (what time it is ''now'' and who ''I'' am), and [[personal identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conitzer|first=Vincent|title=A Puzzle about Further Facts|journal=Erkenntnis|arxiv=1802.01161|doi=10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imagine a person in the real world who is observing a simulated world on a screen, from the perspective of one of the simulated agents in it. (This is not the kind of simulated reality that is the topic of this article, but we will get to such a simulated reality in the next step of the argument.) The person observing knows that besides the [[computer code|code]] responsible for the physics of the simulation, there must be ''additional'' code that determines in which colors the simulation is displayed on the screen, and which agent's perspective is displayed. (These questions are related to the [[inverted spectrum]] scenario and whether there are further facts about personal identity.) That is, the person can conclude that the facts about the physics of the simulation (which are completely captured by the code governing the physics) do not fully determine her [[consciousness|experience]] by themselves. But then, Conitzer argues, imagine someone who has become so engrossed in the simulation that she has ''forgotten'' that it is a simulation she is watching. For this to be the case, the simulation needs to have an exceptionally high fidelity, bringing us into the territory of simulated reality.  (This situation also resembles the one in the [[dream argument]] discussed above.) In this case, could she not still reach the same conclusion that the facts about the physics (of the simulated reality, though she does not realize it is simulated) do not fully determine her experience by themselves? And if so, can we not conclude the same in our own daily lives?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1561">The '''Spoliation Advisory Panel''' advises the United Kingdom Government on claims for cultural property looted during the Nazi era. 

The Panel is designated by the Secretary of State under Section 3 of the [[Holocaust (Return of Cultural Objects) Act 2009]] to advise on claims made by former owners or their heirs (or in some cases, states or public bodies) for the return of, or compensation for the loss of, items that have come into the effective possession of institutions in the UK, for example artworks in the national collections. It deals with cases where the objects were allegedly lost through seizure or forced sales during the Nazi era, or through looting or other unlawful transactions during the Second World War. It provides non-binding recommendations for return or for [[ex gratia]] payments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lootedart.com/MFEU4P88744_print;Y LootedArt.com description of Panel]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Panel was established in February 2000 by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport as an advisory [[non-departmental public body]] under the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] (DCMS). It was chaired by Sir [[David Hirst (judge)|David Hirst]] until April 2010, when it was reconstituted as a group of expert advisers and Sir [[Donnell Deeny]], a member from the outset, took over as chairman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/cultural_property/3296.aspx/ Spoliation Advisory Panel home page], DCMS website&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;

'''Street fighting''' is [[hand-to-hand combat]] in public places, between individuals or groups of people.&lt;ref name="kungfumagazine"&gt;{{cite news|title= Reality Fighting, Street Fighting &amp; Self Defense|work= [[Kung Fu Tai Chi|Kung Fu Magazine]] |date=|url=http://ezine.kungfumagazine.com/ezine/article.php?article=552|accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[sport fighting]], a street fight might involve weapons, multiple opponents, and no rules. The venue is usually a public place (e.g. a street) and the fight sometimes results in  serious injury or occasionally even death.&lt;ref name="kungfumagazine" /&gt;

The main difference between street fighting and a [[self defense]] situation is that a street fight is avoidable, whereas a self-defense situation is not. The other main difference is that the fight is consensual between both parties. A typical situation might involve two men arguing in a [[bar (establishment)|bar]], then one suggests stepping outside, where the fight commences. Thus, it is often possible to avoid the fight by backing off, while in self-defense, a person is actively trying to escape the situation, using force if necessary to ensure his or her own safety.&lt;ref name="kungfumagazine" /&gt;

In some [[martial arts]] communities, street fighting and self-defense are often considered synonymous.&lt;ref name="kungfumagazine" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Street fight – practical self defence|url=http://skbu.cz/co-umime/street-fight/|accessdate=2010-09-15|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tathātā''' ({{lang-sa|तथाता|tathātā}}; {{lang-pi|तथता|tathatā}}; {{bo|t=དེ་བཞིན་ཉིད་}}; {{zh|c=真如}}) is variously translated as "thusness" or "suchness".  It is a central concept in [[Mahayana]] Buddhism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldwag|first=Arthur|title='Isms &amp; 'Ologies: All the movements, ideologies and doctrines that have shaped our world|publisher=[[Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group]]|page=206|year=2014|quote=Most of its doctrines agree with Theravada Buddhism, but Mahayana does contain a transcendent element: tathata, or suchness; the truth that governs the universe|ISBN=9780804152631}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stevenson|first1=Jay|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Eastern Philosophy|date=2000|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781101158364|page=144|url=https://books.google.fi/books?id=vsvh7UO6TTYC&amp;lpg=PA404&amp;ots=2E40I0iE5Q&amp;dq=stevenson%20jay%20the%20Complete%20Idiot's%20Guide%20to%20Eastern%20Philosophy&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; having a particular significance in [[Chan Buddhism]] as well. The synonym '''dharmatā''' is also often used.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

While alive the Buddha referred to himself as the [[Tathāgata]], which can mean either "One who has thus come" or "One who has thus gone",&lt;ref&gt;Oxford dictionary of Buddhism; P296&lt;/ref&gt; and interpreted correctly can be read as "One who has arrived at suchness".

== Mahayana Buddhism ==
Tathātā in the East Asian Mahayana tradition is seen as representing the base reality and can be used to terminate the use of words. A 5th-century Chinese Mahayana scripture entitled "''[[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana]]''" describes the concept more fully:
{{quote|In its very origin suchness is of itself endowed with sublime attributes. It manifests the highest wisdom which shines throughout the world, it has true knowledge and a mind resting simply in its own being. It is eternal, blissful, its own self-being and the purest simplicity; it is invigorating, immutable, free... Because it possesses all these attributes and is deprived of nothing, it is designated both as the Womb of Tathagata and the Dharma Body of Tathagata.&lt;ref name="Berry1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berry|first=Thomas|title=Religions of India: Hinduism, Yoga, Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ouWxrcybsxIC|year=1996|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-10781-5|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

R. H. Robinson, echoing [[D. T. Suzuki]], conveys how the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]'' perceives dharmata through the portal of [[śūnyatā]]: "The ''Laṅkāvatāra'' is  always   careful   to   balance Śūnyatā with Tathatā, or to insist that when the world is viewed as śūnya, empty, it is grasped  in its  suchness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=Richard H.|title=Some Logical Aspects of Nagarjuna's System|journal=Philosophy East &amp; West|date=1957|volume=6|issue=4|pages=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chan Buddhism ===

In Chan stories, tathātā is often best revealed in the seemingly mundane or meaningless, such as noticing the way the wind blows through a field of grass, or watching someone's face light up as they smile. According to Chan hagiography, [[Gautama Buddha]] transmitted the awareness of tathātā directly to [[Mahākāśyapa]] in what has come to be rendered in English as the [[Flower Sermon]]. In another story, the Buddha asked his disciples, "How long is a human life?" As none of them could offer the correct answer he told them "Life is but a breath".&lt;ref name="CaiBruya1994"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cai|first1=Zhizhong|last2=Bruya|first2=Brian|title=Zen Speaks: Shouts of Nothingness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TN4GAAAACAAJ|year=1994|publisher=Anchor Books|isbn=978-0-385-47257-9|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here we can see the Buddha expressing the impermanent nature of the world, where each individual moment is different from the last. Molloy states, "We know we are experiencing the 'thatness' of reality when we experience something and say to ourselves, 'Yes, that's it; that is the way things are.' In the moment, we recognize that reality is wondrously beautiful but also that its patterns are fragile and passing."&lt;ref name="Molloy2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Molloy|first=Michael|title=Experiencing the World's Religions: Sixth Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CUY0AAAAQBAJ|date=23 November 2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|isbn=978-0-07-743490-8|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thiền master [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]] wrote, "People usually consider walking on water or in thin air a miracle. But I think the real miracle is not to walk either on water or in thin air, but to walk on earth. Every day we are engaged in a miracle which we don't even recognize: a blue sky, white clouds, green leaves, the black, curious eyes of a child--our own two eyes. All is a miracle."&lt;ref name="Hanh1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thích|first=Nhất Hạnh|authorlink=Thích Nhất Hạnh|title=The Miracle of Mindfulness: An Introduction to the Practice of Meditation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uSIRAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12|date=5 April 1996|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-8070-1244-4|page=12|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) a beginning proposition called a thesis, (2) a negation of that thesis called the antithesis, and (3) a synthesis whereby the two conflicting ideas are reconciled to form a new proposition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History of the idea==
[[Thomas McFarland]] (2002), in his ''Prolegomena'' to [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s ''Opus Maximum'',&lt;ref name=STC&gt;Samuel Taylor Coleridge: ''Opus Maximum''. Princeton University Press, 2002, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; identifies [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Kritik der reinen Vernunft]]'' (1781) as the genesis of the thesis/antithesis dyad.  Kant concretises his ideas into:
* Thesis: "The world has a beginning in time, and is limited with regard to space."
* Antithesis: "The world has no beginning and no limits in space, but is infinite, in respect to both time and space."

Inasmuch as conjectures like these can be said to be resolvable, [[Fichte]]'s ''Grundlage der gesamten Wissenschaftslehre'' (''Foundations of the Science of Knowledge'', 1794) resolved Kant's dyad by synthesis, posing the question thus:&lt;ref name=STC/&gt;

* ''Are synthetic judgments a priori possible?''
** No synthesis is possible without a preceding antithesis.  As little as antithesis without synthesis, or synthesis without antithesis, is possible; just as little possible are both without thesis.
Fichte employed the triadic idea "thesis–antithesis–synthesis" as a formula for the explanation of change.&lt;ref name=Ritter&gt;[[Harry Ritter]], ''Dictionary of Concepts in History''. Greenwood Publishing Group (1986), p.114&lt;/ref&gt; Fichte was the first to use the trilogy of words together,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Robert R.|title=Recognition: Fichte and Hegel on the Other|date=1992|publisher=SUNY Press|page=46, note 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his ''Grundriss des Eigentümlichen der Wissenschaftslehre, in Rücksicht auf das theoretische Vermögen'' (1795, ''Outline of the Distinctive Character of the Wissenschaftslehre with respect to the Theoretical Faculty''): "Die jetzt aufgezeigte Handlung ist '''thetisch, antithetisch und synthetisch''' zugleich." ["The action here described is simultaneously thetic, antithetic, and synthetic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fichte|first1=Johann Gottlieb|last2=Breazeale|first2=Daniel|title=Fichte: Early Philosophical Writings|date=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;]

Still according to McFarland, [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] then, in his ''Vom Ich als Prinzip der Philosophie'' (1795), arranged the terms schematically in pyramidal form.

According to [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] (1966), although the triad is often thought to form part of an [[analysis]] of historical and philosophical progress called the Hegelian [[dialectic]], the assumption is erroneous:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Walter Kaufmann|authorlink= Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|title= Hegel: A Reinterpretation|year= 1966|publisher= [[Anchor Books]]|chapter= § 37|isbn= 978-0-268-01068-3|oclc= 3168016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Whoever looks for the stereotype of the allegedly Hegelian dialectic in Hegel's ''Phenomenology'' will not find it. What one does find on looking at the table of contents is a very decided preference for triadic arrangements. ... But these many triads are not presented or deduced by Hegel as so many theses, antitheses, and syntheses. It is not by means of any dialectic of that sort that his thought moves up the ladder to '''[[absolute knowledge]]'''.}}

[[Gustav E. Mueller]] (1958) concurs that Hegel was not a proponent of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, and clarifies what the concept of dialectic might have meant in Hegel's thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mueller|first1=Gustav|title=The Hegel Legend of "Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis"|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|date=1958|volume=19|issue=4|pages=411–414}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"Dialectic" does not for Hegel mean "thesis, antithesis, and synthesis." Dialectic means that any "ism" – which has a polar opposite, or is a special viewpoint leaving "the rest" to itself – must be criticized by the logic of philosophical thought, whose problem is reality as such, the "World-itself".}}

According to Mueller, the attribution of this tripartite dialectic to Hegel is the result of "inept reading" and simplistic translations which do not take into account the genesis of Hegel's terms: 
{{quote|Hegel's greatness is as indisputable as his obscurity. The matter is due to his peculiar terminology and style; they are undoubtedly involved and complicated, and seem excessively abstract. These linguistic troubles, in turn, have given rise to legends which are like perverse and magic spectacles - once you wear them, the text simply vanishes. Theodor Haering's monumental and standard work has for the first time cleared up the linguistic problem. By carefully analyzing every sentence from his early writings, which were published only in this century, he has shown how Hegel's terminology evolved - though it was complete when he began to publish. Hegel's contemporaries were immediately baffled, because what was clear to him was not clear to his readers, who were not initiated into the genesis of his terms.

An example of how a legend can grow on inept reading is this: Translate "Begriff" by "concept," "Vernunft" by "reason" and "Wissenschaft" by "science" – and they are all good dictionary translations – and you have transformed the great critic of rationalism ''and'' irrationalism into a ridiculous champion of an absurd pan-logistic rationalism and scientism.

The most vexing and devastating Hegel legend is that everything is thought in "thesis, antithesis, and synthesis."&lt;ref&gt;Mueller 1958, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) and [[Friedrich Engels]] (1820–1895) adopted and extended the triad, especially in Marx's ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'' (1847). Here, in Chapter 2, Marx is obsessed by the word "thesis";&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/poverty-philosophy/ch02.htm marxists.org: Chapter 2 of "The Poverty of Philosophy", by Karl Marx]&lt;/ref&gt; it forms an important part of the basis for the [[Marx's theory of history|Marxist theory of history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://scholarworks.uni.edu/mtie/vol11/iss1/5/|title=The Validity of Karl Marx's Theory of Historical Materialism|journal=Major Themes in Economics|volume=11|issue=1|pages=35–56|last=Shrimp|first=Kaleb|date=2009|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing pedagogy==
{{See also|Rogerian argument}}
In modern times, the dialectic of ''thesis, antithesis, and synthesis'' has been implemented across the world as a strategy for organizing expositional writing. For example, this technique is taught as a basic organizing principle in French schools:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nadeau|first1=Jean-Benoit|last2=Barlow|first2=Julie|title=Sixty Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong: Why We Love France But Not The French|date=2003|publisher=Sourcebooks, Inc.|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The French learn to value and practice eloquence from a young age. Almost from day one, students are taught to produce plans for their compositions, and are graded on them. The structures change with fashions. Youngsters were once taught to express a progression of ideas. Now they follow a dialectic model of thesis-antithesis-synthesis. If you listen carefully to the French arguing about any topic they all follow this model closely: they present an idea, explain possible objections to it, and then sum up their conclusions. ... This analytical mode of reasoning is integrated into the entire school corpus.}}

Thesis, Antithesis, and Synthesis has also been used as a basic scheme to organize writing in the English language. For example, the website WikiPreMed.com advocates the use of this scheme in writing timed essays for the MCAT standardized test:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The MCAT writing assignment.|url=http://www.wikipremed.com/mcat_essay.php|website=WikiPreMed|publisher=Wisebridge Learning Systems, LLC|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For the purposes of writing MCAT essays, the dialectic describes the progression of ideas in a critical thought process that is the force driving your argument. A good dialectical progression propels your arguments in a way that is satisfying to the reader.

:The thesis is an intellectual proposition.
:The antithesis is a critical perspective on the thesis.
:The synthesis solves the conflict between the thesis and antithesis by reconciling their common truths, and forming a new proposition. }}

[[Image:Palkhi 2008.jpg|thumb|A Varkari, carrying an ektari with a saffron flag attached and ''Chiplya'' [[cymbal]]s tied to strings in his hands, journeying from Alandi to Pandharpur]]

'''Varkari''' or '''Warkari'''(meaning "a pilgrim") is a [[sampradaya]] (religious movement) within the [[bhakti]] spiritual tradition of [[Vaishnavism]] part of [[Hinduism]], geographically associated with the Indian state of [[Maharashtra]]. Varkaris worship Vitthal (also known as [[Vithoba]]), the presiding deity of [[Pandharpur]], regarded as a form of [[Krishna]]. Saints and [[guru]]s of the [[bhakti movement]] associated with the Varkaris include [[Jñāneśvar]], [[Namdev]], [[Chokhamela]], [[Eknath]], and [[Tukaram]], all of whom are accorded the title of [[Sant (religion)|Sant]].

The Varkari movement includes the worship Vithoba and a duty-based approach towards life emphasising moral behavior and strict avoidance of [[alcohol]] and [[tobacco]], the adoption of a strict [[lacto vegetarianism|lacto-vegetarian]] diet and fasting on ''[[Ekadashi]]'' day (twice a month), self-restraint (''[[brahmacharya]]'') during [[student]] life, equality and humanity for all rejecting discrimination based on the [[caste system in India|caste system]] or wealth, the reading of [[Hindu texts]], the recitation of the ''[[Haripath]]'' every day and the regular practice of ''[[bhajan]]'' and ''[[kirtan]]''.

== Influence ==
The Varkari tradition has been part of Hindu culture in Maharashtra since the thirteenth-century CE, when it formed as a ''panth'' (community of people with shared spiritual beliefs and practices) during the [[Bhakti movement]]. Varkaris recognise around fifty poet-saints (''[[Sant (religion)|sant]]s'') whose works over a period of 500 years were documented in an eighteenth-century [[hagiography]] by [[Mahipati]]. The Varkari tradition regards these sants to have a common spiritual line of descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sants: Studies in a Devotional Tradition of India |editor1-first=Karine |editor1-last=Schomer |editor2-first=W. H. |editor2-last=McLeod |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |year=1987 |isbn=9788120802773 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OkKhOivXrhgC |pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Varkaris look upon God as the Ultimate Truth and ascertained grades of values in social life but accepted ultimate equality among men. Varkaris bow in front of each other because "everybody is Brahma" and stressed individual sacrifice, forgiveness, simplicity, peaceful co-existence, compassion, non-violence, love and humility in social life.{{cn|date=March 2015}}

The Varkari poets put God-realisation (''haripath'') in simple terms in small booklets of verse. Each saint extolled ''[[japa]]'', chanting the Lord's name. [[Dnyaneshwar]], [[Namdev]], [[Eknath]], [[Tukaram]], [[Santaji Jagnade]], and other [[Marathi people|Marathi]] Bhakti saints of the sect tried to mould the attitude of the common people, which included low castes and women, to have a kind of detachment and the courage of one's convictions in the face of evil forces.{{cn|date=March 2015}}

==Pilgrimages==

Varkari people undertake an annual pilgrimage (''vari'') to Pandharpur, gathering there on ''Ekadashi'' (the 11th day) of the Hindu [[lunar calendar]] month of [[Ashadha]], corresponding to a date falling sometime between late June to July in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. Pilgrims carry [[Pandharpur Wari|Palkhi]] of the saints from their places of ''[[Samadhi]]'' (Enlightenment or "spiritual birth"). The tradition of carrying the ''paduka'' (sandals) of the sants in a Palkhi was started by the youngest son of [[Tukaram]], Narayan Maharaj, in 1685. Further changes were brought to the pilgrimage by descendants of Tukaram in the 1820s and by Haibatravbaba, a courtier of the [[Scindia]]s and devotee of Dnyaneshwar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The wari tradition|url=http://www.warisantanchi.com/english/parampara2.html|website=Wari Santanchi|accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mokashi|first1=Digambar Balkrishna|last2=Engblom|first2=Philip C (Translator)|title=Palkhi: An Indian Pilgrimage|date=1987|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=0-88706-461-2|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=-5vIv4oxeh4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devotees of Vitthal were holding pilgrimages prior to the 14th century.In the present day,  about 40 palkhis and their devotees from all over Maharashtra do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/mag/2005/07/31/stories/2005073100130200.htm Hindu.com] and page 21 of [http://www.vidyaonline.net/arvindgupta/introhisddk.pdf VidyaOnline.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Another pilgrimage is celebrated on the ''Ekadashi'' of the month of [[Kartik (month)|Kartika]], which falls in November of the Gregorian Calendar.

Events such as ''Ringan'' and ''Dhava'' are held during the pilgrimage. During the ''Ringan'', an unmounted sacred horse called Maulincha Ashva, who is believed to be the soul of the saint whose idol is being carried in the litter, runs through the rows of pilgrims, who try catching the dust particles kicked off and smear their head with the same. ''Dhava'' is another kind of race where everyone wins and it is held to commemorate the manner in which Tukaram first saw the temple at Pandharpur and started running in sheer exhilaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mokashi|first1=Digambar Balkrishna|last2=Engblom|first2=Philip C (Translator)|title=Palkhi: An Indian Pilgrimage|date=1987|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=0-88706-461-2|page=264|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=-5vIv4oxeh4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lifestyle ==
Varkari wear tulasi-mala, a [[rosary]] made from ''[[Ocimum tenuiflorum]]''. They are lacto-vegetarians and follow a [[sattvic diet]]. Furthermore, like many other Vaishnava sects, they refrain from using onion and garlic in their cooking. Sect members also refrain from intoxicating substances such as alcohol.&lt;ref name="Reference is in Marathi language"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dikshit|first1=S H|title=Varkari|date=1971|publisher=Marathi Vishwakosh|location=Wai Maharashtra|url=http://marathivishwakosh.maharashtra.gov.in/khandas/khand16/index.php/23-2015-01-15-05-35-16/9948-2012-12-05-07-28-23?showall=1&amp;limitstart=|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wai Hnin Pwint Thon''' ({{lang-my|ဝေနှင်းပွင့်သုန်}}; born January 4, 1989) is a Burmese activist based in London. Wai Hnin was born in [[Yangon|Rangoon]], [[Burma]] (Myanmar) and is the daughter of [[Mya Aye (activist)|Mya Aye]] (Burmese:မြအေး), one of the leaders of the [[8888 Uprising|88 Generation]] student group in Burma.

Throughout her life, Wai Hnin's father was imprisoned for political involvement, meeting him for the first time through bars. She left Burma in 2006 to study in [[London]].  Shortly after arriving in London, her father was arrested for taking part in events leading up to the "[[Saffron Revolution]]" in Burma and sentenced to 65.5 years in prison.  Since that time Wai Hnin has sought to raise her father's detention and the plight of the more than 2,200 other political prisoners&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11741612 BBC article: "Who are Burma's political prisoners?" (13/11/2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; currently held in detention in Burma. Wai Hnin has worked for [[Burma Campaign UK]] and [[Amnesty International]] and has frequently appeared in British and international media. In 2010, after meeting Wai Hnin, former [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]], [[David Miliband]], remarked that he was "struck first by her bravery and strength in leaving her family for a new life to study here in Britain, and secondly by her determination to bring about change in Burma." She has been studying [[Global politics]] and [[International Relations]] in [[Birkbeck, University of London]] since 2013 and in 2016, she got a [[Bachelor Degree]] .&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/aug/13/burma-human-rights-pressure Guardian article: "Keep making noise about Burma" (13/08/2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wildness''', in its literal sense, is the quality of being [[Wildlife|wild]] or [[Domestication|untamed]]. Beyond this, it has been defined as a quality produced in [[nature]],&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; as that which emerges from a forest,&lt;ref&gt;Micoud 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a level of achievement in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Cookson 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has been defined as "a quality of interactive processing between organism and nature where the realities of base natures are met, allowing the construction of durable systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cookson |first=L. J. |title=A definition for wildness |journal=Ecopsychology |year=2011 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=187–193 |doi=10.1089/eco.2011.0028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[wilderness]] is a place where wildness occurs.

== Cultural perceptions of wildness ==
People have explored the contrast of wildness versus tameness throughout recorded history. The earliest great work of literature, the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], tells a story of a wild man [[Enkidu]] in opposition to [[Gilgamesh]] who personifies civilization. In the story, Enkidu is defeated by Gilgamesh and becomes civilized. Cultures vary in their perception of the separation of humans from nature, with [[western civilization]] drawing a sharp contrast between the two while the traditions of many [[indigenous peoples]] have always seen humans as part of nature. The perception of man's place in nature and civilization has also changed over time. In western civilization, for example, [[Darwinism]] and environmentalism have renewed the perception of humans as part of nature, rather than separate from it.
 
Wildness is often mentioned in the writings of naturalists, such as [[John Muir]] and [[David Brower]], where it is admired for its freshness and otherness. [[Henry David Thoreau]] wrote the famous phrase, “In wildness is the preservation of the world.” Some artists and photographers such as [[Eliot Porter]] explore wildness in the themes of their works. The benefits of reconnecting with nature by seeing the achievements of wildness is an area being investigated by [[ecopsychology]].

Attempts to identify the characteristics of wildness are varied. One consideration sees wildness as that part of nature which is not controllable by humans. Nature retains a measure of autonomy, or wildness, apart from human constructions (Evanoff, 2005). Another version of this theme is that wildness produces things that are natural, while humans produce things that are artificial (man-made). Ambiguities about the distinction between the natural and the artificial animate much of art, literature and philosophy. There is the perception that naturally produced items have a greater elegance over artificial things. Modern zoos seek to improve the health and vigour of animals by simulating natural settings, in a move away from stark man-made structures.

Another view of wildness is that it is a social construct (Callicott 1994), and that humans cannot be considered innately ‘unnatural’. As wildness is claimed to be a quality that builds from animals and ecosystems, it often fails to be considered within reductionist theories for nature.

Meanwhile, an [[Ecology|ecological]] perspective sees wildness as "(the degree of) subjection to [[natural selection]] pressures", many of which emerge independently from the [[biosphere]].  Thus [[modern civilization]] - contrasted with all [[human]]ity – can be seen as an 'unnatural' force (lacking wildness) as it strongly insulates its population from many natural selection mechanisms, including [[interspecific competition]] such as predation and disease, as well as some [[intraspecific]] phenomena.

== Wildness in animals ==

The importance of maintaining wildness in animals is recognized in the management of [[Wilderness areas]]. Feeding wild animals in national parks for example, is usually discouraged because the animals may lose the skills they need to fend for themselves. Human interventions may also upset continued [[natural selection]] pressures upon the population, producing a version of [[domestication]] within wildlife (Peterson et al. 2005).

Tameness implies a reduction in wildness, where animals become more easily handled by humans. Some animals are easier to tame than others, and are amenable to domestication.

===Rating scales for mouse wildness===
In a clinical setting, ''wildness'' has been used as a scale to rate the ease with which various strains of laboratory mice can be captured and handled ([http://phenome.jax.org/pub-cgi/phenome/mpdcgi?rtn=projects/doc&amp;sym=Wahlsten2&amp;doc=protocol Wahlsten et al. 2003]):
         
{| class="wikitable"
|-

In this sense, "wildness" may be interpreted as "tendency to respond with anxiety to handling".  That there is no ''necessary'' connection between this factor and the state of wildness ''per se'', given that some animals in the wild may be handled with little or no cause of anxiety. However, this factor does clearly indicate an animal's resistance to being handled.

===Degrees of domestication===
{{main|Domestication}}
A [[Categorization|classification]] system can be set out showing the spectrum from wild to domesticated animal states:
* '''Wild''': These species experience their full life cycles without deliberate human intervention.
* '''Raised at [[zoo]]s or [[botanical garden]]s''' (captive): These species are nurtured and sometimes bred under human control, but remain as a group essentially indistinguishable in appearance or behaviour from their wild counterparts. (Zoos and botanical gardens sometimes exhibit domesticated or feral animals and plants such as [[camel]]s, [[Mustang (horse)|mustang]]s, and some [[orchids]].)
* '''Raised commercially''' (captive or semidomesticated): These species are [[ranch]]ed or [[farm]]ed in large numbers for food, commodities, or the pet trade, but as a group they are not substantially altered in appearance or behavior.  Examples include the [[elephant]], [[ostrich]], [[deer]], [[alligator]], [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]], [[pearl]] [[oyster]], and [[ball python]]. (These species are sometimes referred to as ''partially domesticated''.)
* '''Domesticated''': These species or varieties are bred and raised under human control for many generations and are substantially altered as a group in appearance or behaviour. Examples include the [[domestic canary|canary]], [[pigeon]]s, the [[budgerigar]], the [[peach-faced lovebird]], [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, [[sheep]], [[cattle]], [[chicken]]s, [[llama]]s, [[guinea pig]]s and laboratory [[mouse|mice]].

This classification system does not account for several complicating factors: [[genetically modified]] organisms, [[feral]] populations, and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]].  Many species that are farmed or ranched are now being genetically modified. This creates a unique category of them because it alters the organisms as a group but in ways unlike traditional domestication. Feral organisms are members of a population that was once raised under human control, but is now living and multiplying outside of human control.  Examples include [[Mustang (horse)|mustangs]].  Hybrids can be wild, domesticated, or both: a [[liger]] is a hybrid of two wild animals, a [[mule]] is a hybrid of two domesticated animals, and a [[beefalo]] is a cross between a wild and a domestic animal.

== Wildness in human psychology ==
{{main|Ecopsychology}}

The basic idea of ecopsychology is that while the human mind is shaped by the modern social world, it can be readily inspired and comforted by the wider natural world, because that is the arena in which it originally evolved. Mental health or unhealth cannot be understood in the narrow context of only intrapsychic phenomena or social relations. One also has to include the relationship of humans to other species and ecosystems. These relations have a deep evolutionary history; reach a natural affinity within the structure of their brains and they have deep psychic significance in the present time, in spite of urbanization. Humans are dependent on healthy nature not only for their physical sustenance, but for mental health, too.

== Wildness in political philosophy ==
{{main|State of nature}}

The concept of a state of nature was first posited by the 17th century English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''. Hobbes described the concept in the Latin phrase ''[[bellum omnium contra omnes]]'', meaning "the war of all against all." In this state any person has a [[natural right]] to do anything to preserve their own liberty or safety. Famously, he believed that such a condition would lead to a "war of every man against every man" and make life "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."

Hobbes's view was challenged in the eighteenth century by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who claimed that Hobbes was taking socialized persons and simply imagining them living outside of the society they were raised in. He affirmed instead that people were born neither good nor bad; men knew neither vice nor virtue since they had almost no dealings with each other. Their bad habits are the products of [[civilization]] specifically social hierarchies, [[property]], and markets. Another criticism put forth by [[Karl Marx]] is his concept of [[species-being]], or the unique potential of humans for dynamic, creative, and cooperative relations between each other. For Marx and others in his line of [[critical theory]], [[Social alienation|alienated]] and [[reification (Marxism)|abstracted]] social relations prevent the fulfillment of this potential (see [[anomie]]).

[[David Hume]]'s view brings together and challenges the theories of Rousseau and Hobbes. He posits that in the natural state we are born wicked and evil because of, for instance, the cry of the baby that demands attention. Like Rousseau, he believes that society shapes us, but that we are born evil and it is up to society to shape us into who we become.

[[Thoreau]] made many statements on wildness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In Wildness is the preservation of the World.  — "Walking"

I wish to speak a word for Nature, for absolute Freedom and Wildness, as contrasted with a Freedom and Culture merely civil, — to regard man as an inhabitant, or a part and parcel of Nature, rather than a member of society.  — "Walking"

I long for wildness, a nature which I cannot put my foot through, woods where the wood thrush forever sings, where the hours are early morning ones, and there is dew on the grass, and the day is forever unproved, where I might have a fertile unknown for a soil about me.  — Journal, 22 June 1853

As I came home through the woods with my string of fish, trailing my pole, it being now quite dark, I caught a glimpse of a woodchuck stealing across my path, and felt a strange thrill of savage delight, and was strongly tempted to seize and devour him raw; not that I was hungry then, except for that wildness which he represented.  — Walden

What we call wildness is a civilization other than our own.  — Journal, 16 February 1859

In Wildness is the preservation of the World.  — "Walking"

We need the tonic of wildness — to wade sometimes in marshes where the bittern and the meadow-hen lurk, and hearing the booming of the snipe; to smell the whispering sedge where only some wilder and more solitary fowl builds her nest, and the mink crawls with its belly close o the ground.  — Walden

It is in vain to dream of a wildness distant from ourselves. There is none such.  — Journal, 30 August 1856

The most alive is the wildest.  — "Walking"

Whatever has not come under the sway of man is wild. In this sense original and independent men are wild — not tamed and broken by society.  — Journal, 3 September 1851

Trench says a wild man is a willed man. Well, then, a man of will who does what he wills or wishes, a man of hope and of the future tense, for not only the obstinate is willed, but far more the constant and persevering. The obstinate man, properly speaking, is one who will not. The perseverance of the saints is positive willedness, not a mere passive willingness. The fates are wild, for they will; and the Almighty is wild above all, as fate is.  — Journal, 27 June 1853&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32340">'''Workplace aggression''' is a specific type of [[aggression]] which occurs in the workplace. Workplace aggression can include a wide range of behaviors, ranging from verbal acts (e.g., insulting someone or spreading rumors) to physical attacks (e.g., punching or slapping).

==Definition==
Aggression, in general, is any behavior an individual carries out with the intent to harm another person or group of people. The aggressor must believe that their behavior is harmful to their target, and that the target is motivated to avoid this behavior.&lt;ref name=andersonbushman02&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=CA |last2= Bushman |first2=BJ |title=Human aggression |journal=Annu Rev Psychol |volume=53 |issue= |pages=27–51 |year=2002 |pmid=11752478 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135231 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A defining feature of aggression is the intent or motivation to harm. For a behavior to be considered an aggressive act, the individual committing the behavior must intend harm. In other words, if they inflict harm on another without that specific intent, it is not considered aggression.&lt;ref name=andersonbushman02/&gt;

Aggression can occur in a variety of situations. One important domain to understand aggression is in the workplace. Workplace aggression is considered a specific type of [[counterproductive work behavior]] (CWB) and is defined as "any act of aggression, physical assault, threatening or coercive behavior that causes physical or emotional harm in a work setting."&lt;ref name=rai02&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rai | first1 = S. | year = 2002 | title = Preventing workplace aggression and violence—A role for occupational therapy | url = | journal = Journal of Prevention, Assessment, and Rehabilitation | volume = 18 | issue = 15–22| pages = 15–22 |pmid=12441587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers specify that workplace aggression only includes efforts to harm coworkers, former coworkers, current employers, or past employers.&lt;ref name=neumanbaron98/&gt; Others include in workplace aggression any behaviors intended to harm another person that are enacted in a workplace.&lt;ref name=peekasarunyanzwerling01&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0749-3797(00)00290-7 | last1 = Peek-Asa | first1 = C. | last2 = Runyan | first2 = C.W. | last3 = Zwerling | first3 = C. | year = 2001 | title = The role of surveillance and evaluation research in the reduction of violence against workers | url = | journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 141–148 | pmid = 11165457 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
To delineate the range of behaviors that can be considered aggressive workplace behaviors, researchers have developed schemes of classification for workplace aggression. Neuman and Baron (1998) offer these three dimensions that encompass the range of workplace aggression:
# Expressions of hostility – behaviors that are primarily verbal or symbolic in nature
# [[Obstructionism]] – behaviors intended to hinder an employee from performing their job or the organization from accomplishing its objectives
# Overt aggression – violent acts

In an attempt to further break down the wide range of aggressive workplace behaviors, Baron and Neuman (1996) also classify workplace aggression based on these three dichotomies:
# Verbal–physical
# Direct–indirect
# Active–passive&lt;ref name=baronneuman96&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2337(1996)22:3&lt;161::AID-AB1&gt;3.0.CO;2-Q | last1 = Baron | first1 = R.A. | last2 = Neuman | first2 = J.H. | year = 1996 | title = Workplace violence and workplace aggression: Evidence of their relative frequency and potential causes | url = | journal = Aggressive Behavior | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 161–173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggressive acts can take any possible combination of these three dichotomies. For example, failing to deny false rumors about a coworker would be classified as verbal–passive–indirect. Purposely avoiding the presence of a coworker you know is searching for your assistance could be considered physical–passive–direct.

Other researchers offer a classification system based on the aggressor's relationship to the victim.&lt;ref name=peekasarunyanzwerling01/&gt;
# Criminal intent (Type I) – this type of aggression occurs when the aggressor has no relationship to the victim or organization.
# Customer/client (Type II) – the aggressor has a relationship with the organization and aggresses while they are being served as a customer.
# Worker on worker (Type III) – both the aggressor and the victim are employees in the same organization. Often, the aggressor is a supervisor, and the victim is a subordinate.
# Personal relationship (Type IV) – the aggressor has a relationship with an employee at an organization, but not the organization itself. This category includes victims who are assaulted by a domestic partner while at work.

==Covert nature==
In the workplace much of the aggressive behavior enacted on targets are considered covert in nature. According to Bjorkqvist, Osterman, and Hjelt-Back, covert behaviors are those behaviors that are designed to disguise the aggressive behavior or aggressive intentions from the target. Overt aggression, on the other hand, includes behaviors that do not hide the aggressive intent and are open in their intentions. Typically, covert aggression is verbal, indirect, and passive in nature, while overt aggression reflects the physical, direct, and active side of the dichotomies.&lt;ref name=bjorkqvist94&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/1098-2337(1994)20:3&lt;173::AID-AB2480200304&gt;3.0.CO;2-D | last1 = Bjorkqvist | first1 = K. | last2 = Osterman | first2 = K. | last3 = Hjelt-Back | first3 = M. | year = 1994 | title = Aggression among university employees | url = | journal = Aggressive Behavior | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 173–184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workplace aggression often takes the form of covert behaviors. This can be attributed to what Bjorkqvist, Osterman, and Lagerspetz call the effect/danger ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/1098-2337(1994)20:1&lt;27::AID-AB2480200105&gt;3.0.CO;2-Q | last1 = Bjorkqvist | first1 = K. | last2 = Osterman | first2 = K. | last3 = Lagerspetz | first3 = K. J. | year = 1994 | title = Sex different in covert aggression among adults | url = | journal = Aggressive Behavior | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 27–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This term refers to the aggressors' subjective evaluation of the relative effects and danger of committing an aggressive act. For an aggressor, it is ideal to have a larger effect/danger ratio. In other words, aggressors want an act to have a large effect with relatively low risk of danger to themselves.

Individuals in the workplace are subjected to prolonged exposure to each other. This prolonged exposure means the victims of the aggressors' actions likely have more time to retaliate, thus increasing the danger aspect of the ratio. Also, workplaces are often communal in nature. That is, people often work in groups and are surrounded by others. The presence of others acts as a built in audience that could "punish" the aggressor for harming a victim. It is for these reasons that individuals often choose covert forms of aggression.&lt;ref name=baronneuman96/&gt;

==Predictors (antecedents)==
Predictors of workplace aggression can occur at both the organizational level and the individual level. Organizational factors examined here include [[organizational justice]], supervision and surveillance, changes in the work environment, and specific job characteristics. At the individual level, gender, age, and alcohol consumption are examined here. While this is not a comprehensive listing of predictors, it does cover the majority of workplace aggression predictors addressed in the empirical literature.

===Organizational (in)justice===
{{Main|Organizational justice}}
Perceived interpersonal justice, the degree to which people feel they are treated with fairness and respect, is negatively related to both psychological and physical aggression against supervisors.&lt;ref name= duprebarling06&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/1076-8998.11.1.13 | last1 = Dupre | first1 = K.E. | last2 = Barling | first2 = J. | year = 2006 | title = Predicting and preventing supervisory workplace aggression | url = | journal = Journal of Occupational Health Psychology | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 13–26 | pmid = 16551171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inness, Barling, and Turner found similar results;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.90.4.731 | last1 = Inness | first1 = M. | last2 = Barling | first2 = J. | last3 = Turner | first3 = N. | year = 2005 | title = Understanding Supervisor-targeted aggression: A within-person, between-jobs design | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 90 | issue = 4| pages = 731–739 | pmid = 16060789 }}&lt;/ref&gt; perceived interpersonal injustice was related to workplace aggression in participants' primary and secondary jobs.

Moreover, perceived procedural justice, the extent to which formal organizational procedures are assumed fair, is related to workplace aggression against supervisors. Greenberg and Barling found that the greater the perceptions of procedural justice, the less workplace aggression was reported.&lt;ref name=greenbergbarling99/&gt;

=== Termination and job security ===
The most extreme forms of workplace aggression may result from personnel decisions, such as individual termination and mass layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Perceptions and Punishments of Workplace Aggression: The Role of Aggression Content, Context, and Perceiver Variables1|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0021-9029.2006.00115.x/abstract|journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology|date = 2006-10-01|issn = 1559-1816|pages = 2509–2531|volume = 36|issue = 10|doi = 10.1111/j.0021-9029.2006.00115.x|first = Theresa J.|last = Brown|first2 = Kenneth E.|last2 = Sumner}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 a man killed one and wounded five others at his former place of employment two years after he was let go from the company due to poor performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Suspect in Orlando shooting spree charged with first-degree murder  - CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/11/06/orlando.shootings/index.html?eref=onion|accessdate = 2015-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar event occurred in 2012 when a man shot and killed four employees and then himself after losing his job earlier that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Suspect in Minneapolis shooting spree was laid-off employee|url = http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/28/14133671-suspect-in-minneapolis-shooting-spree-was-laid-off-employee?lite|accessdate = 2015-07-19|first = U.S.|last = News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Layoff|Downsizing]] is a tactic used by organizations where there is a slow-down in business in order to remain profitable or minimize losses. This tactic is most commonly observed during widespread economic hardships, such as the [[2008 recession|Great Recession]] of 2008.

Perceived [[Job security|job insecurity]], or feelings of impending termination, has been found to be a predictor of workplace aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Incivility and Workplace Violence {{!}} Civility Toolbox {{!}} Show Me Respect: Promoting Civility at the University of Missouri|url = http://civility.missouri.edu/incivility-workplace-violence.php|website = civility.missouri.edu|accessdate = 2015-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supervision and surveillance===
Workplace surveillance ([[employee monitoring]]) is positively related to workplace aggression against supervisors, such that the greater the number of employee surveillance methods used, the greater the amount of workplace aggression.&lt;ref name=greenbergbarling99/&gt; Furthermore, supervisory control over work performance has also been shown positively related to workplace aggression against supervisors.&lt;ref name= duprebarling06/&gt; This type of behavior has been observed both adults and teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Workplace aggression in teenage part-time employees.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0021-9010.91.5.987|journal = Journal of Applied Psychology|date = 2006-01-01|volume = 91|issue = 5|doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.91.5.987|first = Kathryne E.|last = Dupré|first2 = Michelle|last2 = Inness|first3 = Catherine E.|last3 = Connelly|first4 = Julian|last4 = Barling|first5 = Colette|last5 = Hoption|pages=987–997|pmid=16953763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workplace changes===
Baron and Neuman found that certain changes in the work environment can lead to increased aggression that they attribute to heightened anxiety and stress.&lt;ref name=baronneuman96/&gt; Specifically, pay cuts or freezes, changes in management, increased monitoring systems (e.g., increased computer monitoring), increased diversity, and the increased use of part-time employees all were related to higher levels of workplace aggression.

===Job-specific characteristics===
Other antecedents of workplace aggression found in the literature are specific job characteristics. LeBlanc and Kelloway found that certain job features, such as handling guns or collecting valuable items, were significantly more related to workplace aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.87.3.444 | last1 = LeBlanc | first1 = M.M. | last2 = Kelloway | first2 = E.K. | year = 2002 | title = Predictors and outcomes of workplace violence and aggression | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 87 | issue = 3| pages = 444–453 | pmid = 12090602 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time spent at work===
Harvey and Keashly found that length of time at work was able to predict workplace aggression such that the longer hours a person worked, the more likely they were to report aggression. The authors attributed this finding to two possible reasons. First, the more hours worked, the greater statistical probability of being victimized. Second, longer hours worked could contribute to fatigue and frustration. This in turn may increase the likelihood of aggressive actions towards coworkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2224/sbp.2003.31.8.807 | last1 = Harvey | first1 = S. | last2 = Keashly | first2 = L. | year = 2003 | title = Predicting the risk for aggression in the workplace: Risk factors, self-esteem, and time at work | url = | journal = Social Behavior and Personality | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 807–814 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender===
In some studies, gender has been shown a significant predictor of workplace aggression. For example, being male is significantly related to reports of aggression against supervisors.&lt;ref name= duprebarling06/&gt; Furthermore, males are more likely to commit aggressive acts in the presence of other men.&lt;ref name=kaukiainenetal&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ab.1021 | last1 = Kaukiainen | first1 = A. | last2 = Salmivalli | first2 = C. | last3 = Bjorkqvist | first3 = K. | last4 = Osterman | first4 = K. | last5 = Lahtinen | first5 = A. | last6 = Kostomo | first6 = A. | last7 = Lagerspetz | first7 = K. | year = 2001 | title = Overt and covert aggression in work settings in relation to the subjective well-being of employees | url = | journal = Aggressive Behavior | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 360–371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be attributed to societal cultures that dictate "codes of honor." Females, on the other hand, are no more likely to act aggressively in either the presence of females or males.

===Age===
Age is significantly related to aggression. In their study of age and [[job performance]], Ng and Feldman found that older workers (age 40 or older) engaged in less workplace aggression than younger workers.&lt;ref name=ngfeldman08&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.93.2.392 | last1 = Ng | first1 = T.W.H. | last2 = Feldman | first2 = D.C. | year = 2008 | title = The relationship of age to ten dimensions of job performance | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 93 | issue = 2| pages = 392–423 | pmid = 18361640 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol consumption===
The frequency and amount of alcohol typically consumed by a person predicts aggressive behavior. Those who consume more alcohol more frequently are more likely to aggress against a coworker.&lt;ref name= greenbergbarling99&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1379(199911)20:6&lt;897::AID-JOB975&gt;3.0.CO;2-Z | last1 = Greenberg | first1 = L. | last2 = Barling | first2 = J. | year = 1999 | title = Predicting employee aggression against coworkers, subordinates and supervisors: The roles of person behaviors and perceived workplace factors | url = | journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 897–913 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hebei tractor rampage]] began as workplace aggression following alcohol consumption.&lt;ref name="154 per 100"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article548063.ece |title=China coal worker kills 11 in drunken rampage with tractor |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=August 2, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyber-aggression==
'''Cyber-aggression''' or [[Harassment by computer|cyber-harassment]]:

    {{Quote|text=Takes the form of obscene or hate e-mail/text messages that threaten or frighten, or e-mails/text messages that contain offensive content, such as sexist or racist material. What is unique about this type of workplace harassment, compared to more traditional forms of harassment, is that this material can be sent by people in addition to work colleagues, by other individuals outside the workplace (either known or not known to the person) or even in the form of spam. |author=Whitty &amp; Carr |source=&lt;ref name="Whitty_Carr04"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whitty | first1 = Monica T. | last2 = Carr | first2 = Adrian N. | year = 2004 | title = New rules in the workplace: Applying object-relations theory to explain problem Internet and email behaviour in the workplace | doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2004.06.005 | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 235–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

What many do not realize that the phenomenon of cyber-bullying often associated with teenage culture has spread to the workplace in a variety of ways. While this trend is seemingly silent and slow growing, its effects are considered equally hurtful as any form of harassment.

Often, cyber-aggression is the result of individuals in a workplace being offended/upset/or feeling threatened by organizational problems. They then resort to virtual communication as a form of retaliation. These actions are referred to as ''[[Flaming (Internet)|flaming]]'' by Whitty &amp; Carr, or essentially when an individual online writes with hostility towards a particular person or group of people.

===Instant messaging===
Instant messaging has become both a help and a hindrance in organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Greengard, Samuel. "IM speeds workplace communication, but it can also spell trouble." ''Workforce Management'' July 2003: 84-85&lt;/ref&gt; The ease of use with instant messaging, is partially to blame, "Employees can see who else is available, and if it’s someone they want to talk to, they’re able to connect in real time". While this has become an extremely useful tool in workplace communication, instant messengers such at AIM or MSN Messenger are not easily regulated from a managerial aspect, which leads to employees being able to have private conversations on a public platform. These conversations can foster aggressive talk and lead to potentially hurtful information being spread among an organization. Some argue that instant messages are beneficial to the work process because it can easily resolve problems without having to distract the person via phone and you don’t have to wait for an email response.

===Email===
This is one of the most prevalent tools used in cyber-aggression because of its prevalence in workplace communications.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, Hoda. ""E" is for etiquette when sending emails." ''Travel Trade Gazette'' 13 May 2005: 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, Claire. "Want to tell a lie? Put it in email." ''The Times Higher Education Supplement'' 20 Jan. 2007: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Often upset workers send loaded messages and attach the email to a large group of co-workers that are not involved in the issue to bring attention to it. An article from the Travel Trade Gazette give some advice to avoid being aggressive in emails.
* Always give a clear subject
* State exactly what you need in a simple manner
* Avoid terms like ''[[wikt:ASAP|ASAP]]''
* Only use reply all when it refers to the whole group
* Using all upper case is electronic SHOUTING!
* Don’t use texting lexicon
* Never send an email when you are upset

===Social networking===
This is one of the fastest growing ways that workers can lash out against each other. The opportunity is high for individuals to be aggressive in a highly public and open forum. Many choose to speak out at their co-workers or superiors because it is a way for them to vent their feelings while not having to say these things face to face.

==Outcomes==
Like the array of behaviors considered workplace aggression, the consequences of workplace aggression are also extensive. For example, Ng and Feldman suggest that "acts of workplace aggression can cause bodily harm to employees, pose physical danger for customers, create public relations crises, and harm the business reputation of the firm as a whole."&lt;ref name=ngfeldman08/&gt; The outcomes of workplace aggression addressed here include the health and well-being of targeted employees and job performance. Gender differences in outcomes are also addressed.

Severity of the repercussions may be influenced by the position of the aggressor. Hershcovis and Barling found that "...supervisor aggression has the strongest adverse effects across attitudinal and behavioral outcomes", followed by co-worker aggression and outsider aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Towards a multi-foci approach to workplace aggression: A meta-analytic review of outcomes from different perpetrators|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/job.621/abstract|journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior|date = 2010-01-01|issn = 1099-1379|pages = 24–44|volume = 31|issue = 1|doi = 10.1002/job.621|first = M. Sandy|last = Hershcovis|first2 = Julian|last2 = Barling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health and well-being===
Workplace aggression can have devastating effects on an organization's employees.&lt;ref name=baronneuman96/&gt; For example, it has been found that targets of workplace aggression report lower levels of [[well-being]].&lt;ref name=baronneuman96/&gt; Other studies have shown that aggression in the workplace can cause the victims of such behaviors to suffer from health problems and displaced aggression - including perpetuating aggression towards random strangers in the street. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/1061-4087.47.4.205 | last1 = Driscoll | first1 = R. | last2 = Worthington | first2 = K. | last3 = Hurrell | first3 = J.J. | year = 1995 | title = Workplace assault: An emerging job stressor | url = | journal = Consult Psychological Practical Research | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 205–211 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bjorkqvist, Osterman, and Hjelt-Back even found that targets exhibited symptoms similar to those of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), such as anxiety and depression.&lt;ref name=bjorkqvist94/&gt; . Sorensen et al. found possible associations between harassment at work and well-being measures of [[low back pain|lower back pain]] and [[sleep deprivation|sleep deficiency]] among a sample of hospital workers.&lt;ref name=sorensen&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sorensen | first1 = G. | last2 = Stoddard | first2 = A.M. | last3 = Stoffel | first3 = S. | last4 = Buxton | first4 = O. | last5 = Sembajwe | first5 = G. | last6 = Hashimoto | first6 = D.| last7 = Dennerlein | first7 = J.T. | last8 = Hopcia | first8 = K. | year = 2011 | title = The Role of the Work Context in Multiple Wellness Outcomes for Hospital Patient Care Workers | journal = Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine | volume = 53 | issue = 8 | pages = 899–910 | pmid=21775897 | doi=10.1097/JOM.0b013e318226a74a | pmc=3693572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Team performance===
Research has looked at the negative impacts of workplace aggression on team performance and particularly team effectiveness as was evidenced in a recent study by Aube and Rousseau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rousseau | first1 = V. | last2 = Aube | first2 = C. | year = 2011 | title = Interpersonal aggression and team effectiveness: The mediating role of team goal commitment | url = | journal = Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology | volume = 84 | issue = 3| pages = 565–580 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Job satisfaction===
Victims of workplace aggression may suffer from reduced [[job satisfaction]]. Lapierre, Spector, and Leck found that those who perceived being targets of workplace aggression reported significantly lower overall job satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/1076-8998.10.2.155 | last1 = Lapierre | first1 = L.M. | last2 = Spector | first2 = P.E. | last3 = Leck | first3 = J.D. | year = 2005 | title = Sexual versus nonsexual workplace aggression and victims' overall job satisfaction: A meta-analysis | url = | journal = Journal of Occupational Health Psychology | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 155–169 | pmid = 15826225 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, those who perceive abuse from their supervisors report lower levels of job satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1556375 | last1 = Tepper | first1 = B.J. | year = 2000 | title = Consequences of abusive supervision | url = | journal = Academy of Management Journal | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 178–190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender differences in outcomes===
Research has shown that males and females react to workplace aggression differently. While both males and females have reported lower well-being after experiencing aggression in the workplace, studies indicate that the relationship between experienced workplace aggression and decreased well-being was stronger for men. In one study, results showed that men who experienced work aggression were more likely to report physical, psychosocial, affective, and cognitive problems. This study also showed that the type of aggression, whether it is overt or covert, did not matter for these outcomes.&lt;ref name= kaukiainenetal/&gt; The study attributes these findings to the idea of modern-day masculinity, which stresses achievement and success in the workplace.

For females, nonsexual aggression has been found to have a stronger impact on job satisfaction than sexual aggression. Also, nonsexual aggression has a stronger relationship with job satisfaction in females than in males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sexual Versus Nonsexual Workplace Aggression and Victims' Overall Job Satisfaction: A Meta-Analysis.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/1076-8998.10.2.155|journal = Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|date = 2005-01-01|volume = 10|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/1076-8998.10.2.155|first = Laurent M.|last = Lapierre|first2 = Paul E.|last2 = Spector|first3 = Joanne D.|last3 = Leck|pmid=15826225|pages=155–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Prevention programs focus on reducing instances of workplace aggression. Programs that incorporate personnel selection, organizational sanctions, and training are recommended.

===Personnel selection===
Based on a workplace prevention program developed by the United States Postal Service (USPS), Neuman and Baron encourage organizations to use personnel screening and testing to identify potential employees who are likely to behave aggressively before they are even hired. This proactive strategy prevents individuals who are predisposed to aggress from even entering the workplace.&lt;ref name=neumanbaron98/&gt;

===Organizational sanctions===
Explicit policies regarding workplace aggression may help organizations to reduce aggression. Employees who perceived that their organization would punish workplace aggressors reported less workplace aggression even when their perceptions of interpersonal justice were high.&lt;ref name="duprebarling06"/&gt; Neuman and Baron also suggest using organizational policies to curb workplace aggression and to shape strong anti-aggressive organizational norms.&lt;ref name=neumanbaron98/&gt;

===Training===
[[Training]] is also an important part of a prevention program. Neuman and Baron suggest that training for both supervisors and subordinates should focus on teaching employees methods for dealing with aggression.&lt;ref name=neumanbaron98&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neuman | first1 = J.H. | last2 = Baron | first2 = R.A. | year = 1998 | title = Workplace violence and workplace aggression: Evidence concerning specific forms, potential causes, and preferred targets | url = | journal = Journal of Management | volume = 24 | issue =3 | pages = 391–419 |doi=10.1177/014920639802400305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Rai advises that appropriate training should inform employees that management takes threats seriously, encourage employees to report incidents, and demonstrate management's commitment to deal with reported incidents.&lt;ref name=rai02/&gt;

=== Organizational support ===
Organizational support can influence the effects of workplace aggression. Schat and Kelloway isolated two forms of organizational support: instrumental and informational. Instrumental support refers to providing some type of assistance directly to an afflicted individuals, whereas information support refers to providing employees with self-help informational resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Reducing the adverse consequences of workplace aggression and violence: The buffering effects of organizational support.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/1076-8998.8.2.110|journal = Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|date = 2003-01-01|volume = 8|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/1076-8998.8.2.110|first = Aaron C.
