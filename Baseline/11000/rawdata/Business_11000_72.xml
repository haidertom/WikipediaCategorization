== Early life and family==
Floirendo Sr. was born on November 20, 1915 in [[Bauang, La Union]].  He was in his 20s when World War II took place, and made a living through the war by ferrying passengers on his calesa (horse drawn carriage).&lt;ref name="Balana20120720"/&gt;  He eventually married Nenita R. Floirendo, with whom he would have six children.&lt;ref name="Balana20120720"/&gt;

== Early career ==
After the war, Floirendo Sr. was among those who took up President [[Elpidio Quirino]]'s call for people from Luzon and the Visayas to seek opportunities in Mindanao. In [[Davao City|Davao]], he eventually put up Davao Motor Sales (DAMOSA), the first Ford dealership outside Manila.&lt;ref name="Balana20120720"/&gt;

In the 1950s, Quirino gave Floirendo his big break by issuing a proclamation that granted Floirendo the title to a total of 1,200 hectares of previously-unproductive marshland in Davao del Norte. He founded Tagum Agricultural Development Company, Inc. (TADECO) with the intent of turning the land into an [[abaca]] (Musa textilis) plantation.&lt;ref name="Balana20120720"/&gt;

The abaca plantation was highly successful at first, but began to decline in the 60s with the development of synthetic nylon ropes.  Floirendo Sr. promptly shifted TADECO's focus from abaca to bananas.&lt;ref name="Balana20120720"/&gt;

== Association with Ferdinand Marcos ==
Antonio Floirendo Sr. became a close business associate of the Marcoses before Ferdinand Marcos became president, and was a major contributor to Marcos’s 1965 and 1969 presidential campaigns. He also contributed to many of First Lady Imelda Marcos' projects, and was a regular part of Imelda's entourage.&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumCronyism"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://martiallawmuseum.ph/magaral/the-philippines-during-the-martial-law/ |title=It Takes a Village to Loot a Nation: Cronyism and Corruption |website=Martial Law Museum |access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TADECO during the Marcos Dictatorship ==
{{POV section|date=May 2018}}
During the [[Diosdado Macapagal|Macapagal administration]], TADECO leased 6000 hectares of prime, fertile, government land for use as a banana plantation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/24/magazine/creating-a-dynasty-in-the-philipines.html|title=CREATING A DYNASTY IN THE PHILIPINES [sic]|last=Kamm|first=Henry|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the project was halted because it violated the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution of the Philippines]] and Philippine corporate law, which permitted only up to 1,024 hectares of land acquisition. Senator [[Lorenzo Tañada]] chaired a Senate Blue Ribbon Committee investigation into the matter, which caused Floirendo to shelf the plan and wait for a more favorable political climate.

The plan finally came into fruition after Marcos’ second term.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991"/&gt;  When Marcos declared Martial Law in the early 1970s, TADECO began exporting its bananas to the Japanese market, resulting in phenomenal growth for the company.&lt;ref name="Balana20120720"/&gt;

=== Hiring of Prison Laborers ===
Floirendo also hired prisoners from the Davao Penal Colony (Dapecol) as his laborers, permitting him to take advantage of prison labor at starvation wages. Prisoners of Dapecol were given the most physically strenuous jobs in the plantation, such as harvesting, hauling and drainage work. Workers carried over 50 kilos of bananas in long distances, and were severely punished if they damaged the quality of the bananas along the way. The prisoner-laborers were exposed to many health hazards, such as inhalation of chemicals, flu, pneumonia and other respiratory diseases that they caught due to the extent of the labor.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991"/&gt;

==Overseas Properties==
Floirendo also served as a front for the Marcoses in purchasing international properties, a fact he acknowledged when he inked a compromise deal with the Philippines' Presidential Commission on Good Government after the Marcoses were ousted in 1986.&lt;ref name="Salonga2000"/&gt;

With former [[First Lady or First Gentleman of the Philippines|First Lady]] [[Imelda Marcos]], he purchased three condominium apartments in [[Olympic Tower]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/marcos-owns-tadeco/332278/|title=Marcos owns Tadeco - The Manila Times Online|website=www.manilatimes.net|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He purchased two  units at the St. James Towers in Manhattan. He purchased a $1.35 million mansion in Makiki Heights in Hawaii. He purchased the $4.5 million Lindenmere estate in Long Island New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/01/nyregion/the-simple-4.5-million-marcos-house.html|title=The 'Simple' $4.5 Million Marcos House|last=Times|first=Constance L. Hays and Special To the New York|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a $2.5 million Beverly Hills property.&lt;ref name="Salonga2000"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44927743|title=Presidential plunder : the quest for the Marcos ill-gotten wealth|last=R.|first=Salonga, Jovito|date=2000|publisher=U.P. Center for Leadership, Citizenship and Democracy|isbn=9718567283|location=[Quezon City]|oclc=44927743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1986 Escape to Brunei ==
The day before [[Ferdinand Marcos]] fell from power in 1986, Floirendo and his family fled from the Philippines to Brunei.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== Compromise Deal with the Presidential Commission on Good Government ==
Antonio Floirendo Sr. signed a compromise deal with the [[Presidential Commission on Good Government]] (PCGG) in 1987, turning over about PhP 70 million ($1.5 million) in cash and assets.&lt;ref name="PhilipLustreJr20160225"/&gt; This included the Lindenmere Estate and [[Olympic Tower]] in New York City; a property in [[Beverly Hills, California]]; and the mansion at 2443 Makiki Heights Drive, [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, in which Marcos lived in exile.&lt;ref name="PhilipLustreJr20160225"/&gt;

== Death ==
Floirendo Sr. died of kidney failure&lt;ref name="FruitNet2012"/&gt; on June 29, 2012 at the age of 96.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=News|first1=ABS-CBN|title=Philippines' banana king dies|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/business/06/29/12/philippines-banana-king-dies|website=ABS-CBN News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Descendants ==
Floirendo Sr. had six children, the second of which and his namesake, Antonio "Tonyboy" Floirendo Jr., would eventually become congressman for the 2nd District of [[Davao Del Norte]].  His grandson, [[Antonio Lagdameo Jr.]] (through his Daughter Linda Floirendo-Lagdameo) would also serve in the same post, in between the terms of his uncle, Tonyboy.&lt;ref name="Balana20120720"/&gt;

'''Asigra Inc.''' is a company that produces a [[Remote backup service|cloud backup]] and recovery software platform known as [[Asigra Cloud Backup]]. The company is privately held and is headquartered in Toronto, Canada.

==History==
The company was founded in 1986 by David Farajun after a hard-drive failure caused the loss of his company's data.&lt;ref name="david_farajun"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-03/backup-veteran-asigra-keeps-calm-as-competitors-crowd-the-cloud.html Backup Veteran Asigra Keeps Calm as Competitors Crowd the Cloud (Bloomberg)]&lt;/ref&gt;  He decided to develop technology to back up data to a secure location over communication lines, hence establishing Asigra.

The name Asigra comes from the Spanish infinitive ''asegurar'', meaning to ''assure''.

==Business model==
Asigra sells its products to value added resellers, managed service providers, and telcos, who use the software to run cloud backup services for consumers, small and medium businesses and large enterprises.&lt;ref name="business_model"&gt;[http://searchstoragechannel.techtarget.com/news/1353704/Asigra-forges-channel-partner-program-for-MSPs-resellers Asigra forges channel partner program for MSPs, resellers]&lt;/ref&gt;

These service providers are free to structure their business operations, pricing, and cloud deployment models independently. They can choose to sell the software as a service ([[SaaS]]) or as either a physical or virtual appliance to their customers in any one of the cloud deployment models – [[Cloud computing#Public cloud|public]], [[Cloud computing#Private cloud|private]], or [[Cloud computing#Hybrid cloud|hybrid]].

==Product==
''Asigra Cloud Backup'' is the company's only product. It contains various backup and recovery modules, based on the data sources that need to be backed up. The price of the product is based on the amount of data that is stored in compressed, deduplicated and encrypted form at the backup repository.

==Alliances==
NetApp and Asigra sell Data Protection as a Service (DPaaS) to cloud services providers.&lt;ref name="netapp_dpaas"&gt;[http://www.netapp.com/au/solutions/service-providers/data-protection-service/asigra.aspx NetApp Solution for Data Protection as a Service Solution with Asigra]&lt;/ref&gt; The company has also developed products with Cisco and Intel, which are designed for distributed remote offices and the small and medium business spaces, respectively.&lt;ref name="cisco"&gt;[https://marketplace.cisco.com/catalog/products/3116 Details of Asigra-Cisco Partnership]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="intel"&gt;[http://download.intel.com/support/progserv/appupsbs/hybrid/sb/asigra_cloud_backup_isv_initial_setup_guide1.pdf Details of Asigra-Intel Partnership]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asigra platform runs in the [[IBM cloud computing#IBM SmartCloud|IBM SmartCloud]] infrastructure as a service ([[Cloud computing#Service models|IaaS]]) platform and can back up and recover data to and from machines in the IBM SmartCloud.&lt;ref name="ibm_smartcloud"&gt;[http://www-304.ibm.com/partnerworld/gsd/solutiondetails.do?&amp;solution=47323&amp;lc=en IBM SmartCloud Integration]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Licensing models==
Asigra introduced the patent pending Recovery License Model® (RLM) on July 10, 2013 to address rising storage costs stemming from growing data volume. This licensing model allows users to pay based on data recovered.

The Capacity License Model (CLM), introduced in 1992, is based on the amount of data stored and is the prevalent pricing model used in the market today by most vendors in the backup and recovery industry. Asigra provides organizations the option to choose between the current CLM or the new RLM based on the organizations' business needs.

==Awards and recognition==
The Asigra software has been featured in the [[Magic Quadrant|Gartner Magic Quadrant]] for Enterprise Backup and Recovery Software for two years in a row.&lt;ref name="gartner_quadrant"&gt;[http://www.mspalliance.com/2012/07/asigra-named-in-2012-leading-analyst-firm-magic-quadrant-for-enterprise-backup-and-recovery-software/ Asigra in Gartner Magic Quadrant] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715051708/http://www.mspalliance.com/2012/07/asigra-named-in-2012-leading-analyst-firm-magic-quadrant-for-enterprise-backup-and-recovery-software/ |date=July 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has won various awards, including the 2012 North American New Product Innovation Award in Cloud-Based Data Management from [[Frost &amp; Sullivan]],&lt;ref name="2012_frost_sullivan"&gt;[http://www.mspalliance.com/2012/10/frost-sullivan-presents-2012-product-innovation-award-to-asigra-for-cloud-backup-recovery-software/ Frost &amp;amp; Sullivan Presents 2012 Product Innovation Award to Asigra for Cloud Backup &amp; Recovery Software] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017230959/http://www.mspalliance.com/2012/10/frost-sullivan-presents-2012-product-innovation-award-to-asigra-for-cloud-backup-recovery-software/ |date=October 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Storage Magazine Gold "Product of the Year" in the Enterprise backup category,&lt;ref name="search_storage_gold"&gt;[http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/guides/Best-data-storage-products-2011-Products-of-the-Year-winners 2012 Gold &amp;quot;Product of the Year&amp;quot; by the Storage Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; and a 5 star rating for its channel partner program from [[CRN Magazine]].&lt;ref name="crn_five_star"&gt;[http://www.crn.com/partner-program-guide/ppg2012-details.htm?c=14 5-Star Rating in CRN Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7643">'''Ballu Khan''' is an [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijian]]businessman of New Zealand citizenry.  His company, [[Tui Management Services]], is the joint owner with the [[Vanua Development Corporation]] (VDC) of [[Pacific Connex]] (PCX), which sells SAP software and has sought to enter the 3G mobile telephony market in Fiji. VDC is the commercial wing of the [[Native Land Trust Board]] (NLTB) which administers indigenous land holdings throughout Fiji. He is also a major supporter of the [[Ovalau (Fiji)|Ovalau]] [[Rugby union in Fiji|Rugby Union team]].

Khan is known for his close ties with the former government of [[Laisenia Qarase]], which was deposed in the [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|military coup]] of 5 December 2006.  He has a tense relationship with the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces]], which predates the coup.

The [[Fiji Sun]] reported on 25 October 2006 that [[Colonel]] [[Pita Driti]], the Land Force Commander, had condemned Khan for employing former [[Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unit]] (CRW) soldiers as bodyguards.  The CRW was implicated in a [[Mutinies of the 2000 Fijian coup d'état|mutiny]] which left eight soldiers dead on 2 November 2000.  Driti and [[Captain (land)|Captain]] [[Esala Teleni]], the Deputy Commander of the Military, issued a veiled threat to Khan,  warning that the Military was in a position to stop former CRW soldiers from working for him.

Following the coup, armed soldiers raided the PCX office and Khan's private residence on 9 December 2006, and arrested six bodyguards who had been CRW soldiers. Documents and hard drives were removed from the office, according to Colonel Driti. Khan's house was raided again on 12 December. All of these raids took place while Khan was out of Fiji.

==Early life==
Ballu Khan was born in [[Nalomolomo]] on [[Nairai Island]] in 1959. His father died in the Kadavulevu ship disaster when he was 4. He graduated with a master's degree in Commerce from the [[University of the South Pacific]]. He became a school teacher and taught at [[Vunisea]] and [[Laucala]] Bay Secondary School. He then trained as a chartered accountant and became an investigator for New Zealand's [[Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand)|Inland Revenue Department]].

==Business==
Khan formed Tui Consulting in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] in 1997. Tui Consulting's business was assisting utilities and public sector organizations implement SAP software solutions. Tui Consulting has undertaken SAP projects in New Zealand, Australia, United States, Canada, and Singapore. In 2002 he moved the company's headquarters to [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Company moving HQ to Takoma|url=http://seattle.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2002/06/03/daily54.html|website=www.bizjournals.com|publisher=www.bizjournals.com|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Axon Group]], a business transformation consultancy acquired Tui Consulting for a price, reported to be up to $(US)11.75 in December 2005

It was reported in February 2005 that Tui Consulting was being sued by [[Singapore]]’s largest electricity retailer, SP Services, for problems related to TUI’s implementation of a SAP computer system. The dispute was reportedly settled in 2005. Reports quoted the utility as saying that it encountered large-scale billing problems beginning in January 2000, eventually affecting about 144,000 of the 1.2 million electricity accounts. Tui Consulting denied the claims and filed a countersuit for $3 million, blaming SP Services for the problems.

The [[New Zealand Herald]] reported (6 November 2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ballu Khan Lively Figure in Business, Politics|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10474258|website=New Zealand Herald|publisher=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Khan had been a controversial figure in Fiji business and political circles. PCX of which he owned 49% won a US$9.2 million contract in 2004 to supply a new SAP based computer system and maintenance service to the NLTB. PCX was described by NLTB as a step to acquire greater indigenous Fijian involvement in Fiji's developing IT industry. PCX was to handle NLTB's requirements as well as to bid for other IT projects. Staff of the NLTB's IT division were transferred to PCX. The Fiji Labour Party called at the time for a commission of inquiry into the awarding of the contract to PCX. An independent audit report undertaken in 2007 by KPMG Australia criticised the NTLB for allegedly failing to conduct a proper investigation before buying the computer system. The KPMG audit report questioned the credibility of the mySap system and recommended the NLTB seriously reconsider continuing its business relations with PCX. The audit report stated that PCX faced financial difficulties and may be insolvent, with VDC having given it a loan of $(US)2.4m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audit Report Severely Critical of Fiji's Native Lands Trust Board|url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=31851|website=Radio New Zealand International|publisher=Radio New Zealand International|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2005 it was reported that Khan was a key figure in a bid by PCX to apply for a 3G mobile telephony wireless licence in Fiji.  Because of the alignment of PCX with NLTB, through VDC, it was put forth by the NLTB as a company that represented the interests of the indigenous Fijian people. Another interested party in the bid was Digicel, owned by [[Ireland|Irish]] telecommunications entrepreneur, Denis O'Brien.

==Sport==

Khan was identified&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NZer 'so badly beaten in Fiji he can't speak'|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10474043|website=New Zealand Herald|publisher=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2003 as making a "substantial" financial contribution to help the Auckland Blues rugby club retain a former All Black, Carlos Spencer, when he had been made offers by European rugby clubs. It was also reported that he supported a rugby academy in Fiji that sent young players to New Zealand.

==2007 Arrest==

Ballu Khan was one of a group of people arrested on November 3, 2007 as part of an investigation by the Fiji Police into an alleged assassination plot against members of the government. A military spokesman said that Khan resisted arrest and assaulted the officers who tried to detain him at a checkpoint in [[Lami, Fiji|Lami]]. He also said that Khan had sustained minor injuries and was under armed guard at a hospital in [[Suva]]. 0n November 21. 2007 his lawyer Peter Williams Q.C. stated that Khan was seriously ill in hospital as a result of being assaulted by police and the deadline to charge him with offences related to the alleged assassination plot against national leaders had expired.

On November 22, 2007, [[Fiji Live]] quoted Khan as saying that people of high status within the interim Government of Fiji and the military held grudges against him. On November 25, 2007 a lawyer filed a writ in the Fiji High Court seeking compensation of $F40 million. The writ claimed Khan's treatment amounted to torture and reckless disregard for his health, and his civil rights were abused.  Fiji's interim attorney-general, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, stated the government of Fiji would defend the claim.

[[File:Brisbane map of city cbd.png|right|thumb|upright|Map of the CBD]]
The '''Brisbane central business district''' (CBD), officially gazetted as the suburb of '''Brisbane City''' and colloquially referred to as 'the city', is the heart of the state capital of [[Queensland]], Australia.&lt;ref name=qpn&gt;{{cite QPN|49245|Brisbane|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located on a point on the northern bank of the [[Brisbane River]]. The triangular shaped area is bounded by the Brisbane River to the east, south and west. The point, known at its tip as [[Gardens Point, Brisbane|Gardens Point]], slopes upward to the north-west where the city is bounded by parkland and the inner city suburb of [[Spring Hill, Queensland|Spring Hill]] to the north. The CBD is bounded to the north-east by the suburb of [[Fortitude Valley, Queensland|Fortitude Valley]]. To the west the CBD is bounded by [[Petrie Terrace]], which in 2010 was reinstated as a suburb (after being made a locality of Brisbane City in the 1970s).

== Geography ==
[[File:Bne2017 2.png|thumb|Skyline of the central business district from Mount Coot-tha 2017.]]
The Brisbane central business district is an area of densely concentrated skyscrapers and other buildings, interspersed by several parks such as [[Roma Street Parklands]], [[City Botanic Gardens]] and [[Wickham Park, Brisbane|Wickham Park]]. It occupies an area of 1.367&amp;nbsp;km². The City is laid out according to a grid pattern surveyed during the city's early colonial days, a feature typical of most Australian street patterns. As a general rule, the streets aligned northwest-south east are named after male members of the [[House of Hanover]], while the northeast-south west aligned streets are named after female members.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} [[Queen Street, Brisbane|Queen Street]] was the central roadway, that was turned into a [[pedestrian mall]]. It forms the pivotal axis for the grid of roads within the district.

The Brisbane central business district was built on a spur of the [[Taylor Range (Queensland)|Taylor Range]] with the highest spot in the suburb being [[Wickham Terrace]].&lt;ref name="thenandnow"&gt;{{cite book |title=Brisbane Then and Now |last=Gregory |first=Helen  |year=2007 |publisher=Salamander Books |location=Wingfield, South Australia |isbn=978-1-74173-011-1 |page=60 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[North Quay, Brisbane|North Quay]] is an area in the CBD that was a landing point during the first European exploration of the [[Brisbane River]].

=== Petrie Bight ===
{{Main|Petrie Bight}}
Petrie Bight is a reach of the [[Brisbane River]] ({{coord|-27.4636|153.0351|type:river_region:AU-QLD|name=Petrie Bight}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite QPN|26538|Petrie Bight|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gives its name to the small pocket of land centred on the area under the [[Story Bridge]]'s northern point, around the Brisbane River to [[Admiralty Towers II]]. The location was originally known as Petrie Gardens and was an early settlement farm, one of two that provided food for the colony.&lt;ref name="btn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/queensland/federation/stories/s281845.htm |title=Brisbane – Then and Now – The Centenary of Federation |accessdate=21 August 2009 |date=24 April 2001 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110010052/http://www.abc.net.au/queensland/federation/stories/s281845.htm |archivedate=10 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was named after Andrew Petrie and has been the base for water police and in earlier times wharves.&lt;ref name="thenandnow2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Brisbane Then and Now |last=Gregory |first=Helen |year=2007 |publisher=Salamander Books |location=Wingfield, South Australia |isbn=978-1-74173-011-1 |page=20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The location of [[Customs House, Brisbane|Customs House]] and the preference for wharves was due to site being directly downstream from the central business district.&lt;ref name="thenandnow2" /&gt;

In the last few decades the number of [[apartment building]]s that have been constructed has increased substantially.
Brisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Brisbane|Australia's tallest buildings]]. Brisbane's tallest buildings are Skytower at 270 metres, One William Street at 260 metres, [[Soleil (Brisbane)|Soleil]] at 243&amp;nbsp;metres, [[Aurora Tower]] at 207&amp;nbsp;metres, [[Riparian Plaza]] at 200&amp;nbsp;metres, [[One One One Eagle Street]] at 195 metres, and [[Infinity Tower (Brisbane)|Infinity]] at 249&amp;nbsp;metres, which was completed in 2014.

The Brisbane CBD is one of the major business hubs in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etravelblackboard.com/index.asp?id=73027&amp;nav=13|title=Brisbane business visitor numbers skyrocket|date=3 January 2008|work=Brisbane Marketing Convention Bureau|publisher=e-Travel Blackboard|accessdate=13 January 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120134851/http://www.etravelblackboard.com/index.asp?id=73027&amp;nav=13|archivedate=20 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City contains many tall office buildings occupied by organisations, businesses and all three levels of government that have emerged into a number of precincts. The areas around the [[Queen Street Mall, Brisbane|Queen Street Mall]] and Adelaide Street is primarily a retail precinct. A legal precinct exists around the various court buildings located around the intersections of [[George Street, Brisbane|George Street]] and [[Adelaide Street, Brisbane|Adelaide]] and [[Ann Street, Brisbane|Ann]] Streets.

The government precinct is an area centred on the [[Lands Administration Building|Executive Building]] that includes many [[Government of Queensland|Queensland Government]] offices. [[111 George Street]], [[Mineral House]], and [[Education House]] are also located here.

The Brisbane CBD has only one third the number of premium hotel rooms that either Sydney or Melbourne's central business districts have.&lt;ref name="n32"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/business/property/new-32storey-hotel-planned-for-cbd-20101129-18e1i.html |title=New 32-storey hotel planned for CBD |author=Tony Moore |accessdate=30 November 2010 |date=30 November 2010 |work=[[Brisbane Times]] |publisher=Fairfax Media |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201103352/http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/business/property/new-32storey-hotel-planned-for-cbd-20101129-18e1i.html |archivedate=1 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rental prices ===
Like most other Australian capital cities, Brisbane has [[Australian property bubble|experienced dramatic rises in rental prices]] for residential and office space before the [[global financial crisis]]. At the beginning of 2008, the Brisbane central business district contained 1.7 million square metres of office space.&lt;ref name=news1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23170498-421,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070728091913/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23170498-421,00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 July 2007 |title=Business boom leaves Brisbane without office space |accessdate=25 November 2008 |date= |work=[[news.com.au]] |publisher=[[News Limited]] }} &lt;/ref&gt;
High demand in the office market had pushed vacancy rates in the Brisbane CBD to 0.7% by January 2008, the lowest in Australia.&lt;ref name=news1 /&gt; Premium grade office space was even less vacant with an occupancy rate of 99.9%. By the end of 2009 the situation had reversed.  In mid 2013 the market for office space had declined to its worst position in two decades with a vacancy rate of just under 13%.&lt;ref name="boso"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/brisbane-office-space-overload-20130814-2rwif.html |title=Brisbane office space overload |author=Marissa Calligeros |accessdate=15 August 2013 |date=15 August 2013 |work=Brisbane Times |publisher=Fairfax Media |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816014457/http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/brisbane-office-space-overload-20130814-2rwif.html |archivedate=16 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Schein''' (September 25, 1928 &amp;ndash; May 1, 2003) was a [[polymer chemistry|polymer chemist]]. A political refugee and (Jewish) survivor of the Holocaust from [[Romania]], he arrived in Paris in 1946 and enrolled at the [[University of Paris]]. After receiving his degree, Schein joined the adhesives-formulating group at the French branch of [[Honeywell]]. There he developed the modern form of [[polyvinylchloride]] (PVC)-based [[seam sealant]] used in the manufacturing of [[automobile]]s. In the late 1950s, with Honeywell's consent, he founded [[Caourep]]. In the 1960s and 70s the Caourep Group followed French and other European [[OEM]] automotive producers as they expanded in the first postwar recovery wave of [[globalization]]. Caourep established its own plants or licensees in every country in which [[Renault]], [[Peugeot]], [[Fiat]], [[VW]], and [[Daimler-Benz]] operated directly or by licensing. By the late 1970s, Caourep had become a supplier to the overseas operations of [[Ford]], [[General Motors|GM]], and [[Chrysler]]. By 1977, Caourep was the largest producer of OEM automotive [[adhesive]]s and [[sealant]]s in the world.

In the [[Middle Ages]] or 16th and 17th centuries, a '''cloth merchant''' was one who owned or ran a cloth (often [[wool]]) manufacturing or wholesale import or export business. A cloth merchant might additionally have owned a number of draper's shops. Cloth was extremely expensive and cloth merchants were often very wealthy. A number of Europe's leading banking dynasties such as [[House of Medici|Medici]] and [[Berenberg family|Berenberg]] built their original fortunes as cloth merchants.

In England, cloth merchants might be members of one of the important [[guild|trade guilds]], such as the [[Worshipful Company of Drapers]].

Alternative names are '''clothier''', which tended to refer more to someone engaged in [[cloth production|production]] and the sale of cloth, whereas a cloth merchant would be more concerned with distribution, including overseas trade, or '''haberdasher''', who were merchants in sewn and fine fabrics (e.g. silk) and in London, members of the [[Haberdashers' Company]].

The largely obsolete term '''merchant taylor''' also describes a business person who trades in textiles, and initially a tailor who keeps and sells materials for the garments which he makes. In England, the term is best known in the context of the [[Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors]], one of the [[livery company|livery companies]] of the [[City of London]], nowadays a charitable institution best known for the Merchant Taylors' schools - the Company preserves the ancient spelling "taylor" in its name.

'''Common Ordinary Equity''' (CEQ) represents the common [[shareholder]]s' interest in the company. CEQ is a component of Shareholders' Equity Total (SEQ).

CEQ is the sum of:
* [[Common stock|Common/Ordinary Stock]] (Capital) (CSTK)
* [[Capital surplus|Capital Surplus]]/Share Premium Reserve (CAPS)
* [[Retained earnings|Retained Earnings]] (RE)

less:
* [[Treasury stock|Treasury Stock Total]] (All Capital) (TSTK)

CEQ includes:
* Common stock outstanding, including treasury stock adjustments
* Capital surplus
* Retained earnings
* Treasury stock adjustments for both common and nonredeemable [[preferred stock]]

{{more citations needed|date=September 2012}}'''Complexity theory and organizations''', also called '''complexity strategy''' or '''complex adaptive organizations''', is the use of the study of [[Complex systems|complexity systems]] in the field of [[strategic management]] and [[organizational studies]].

Complexity theory is an interdisciplinary theory that grew out of [[systems theory]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Grobman, Gary M 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Grobman, Gary M.|title=Complexity Theory: a new way to look at organizational change|journal=Public Administration Quarterly|year=2005|url=http://www.complexityforum.com/members/Grobman%202005%20Complexity%20theory.pdf|volume=29|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|350}} It draws from research in the natural sciences that examines uncertainty and non-linearity.&lt;ref name="Grobman, Gary M 2005"/&gt; Complexity theory emphasizes interactions and the accompanying [[feedback]] loops that constantly change systems. While it proposes that systems are unpredictable, they are also constrained by order-generating rules.&lt;ref name="Burnes, Bernard 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Burnes, Bernard|title=Complexity theories and organizational change|journal=International Journal of Management Reviews|volume=7|issue=2|year=2005|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2370.2005.00107.x|pages=73–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|74}}

Complexity theory has been used in the fields of [[strategic management]] and [[organizational studies]].  Application areas include understanding how [[organizations]] or firms [[:wikt:adapt|adapt]] to their environments and how they cope with conditions of uncertainty.  Organisations have complex structures in that they are [[dynamic network analysis|dynamic network]]s of interactions, and their relationships are not aggregations of the individual static entities. They are adaptive; in that the individual and [[collective behavior]] mutate and [[self-organizing|self-organize]] corresponding to a change-initiating micro-event or collection of events.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-T-02" /&gt;

== Key concepts ==

=== Complex adaptive systems ===
Organizations can be treated as [[complex adaptive systems]] (CAS) as they exhibit fundamental CAS principles like self-organization, [[complexity]], [[emergence]],&lt;ref name="CAS-T-13" /&gt; interdependence, space of possibilities, co-evolution, [[Chaos theory|chaos]], and [[self-similarity]].&lt;ref name="CAS-T-01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-T-03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="terra"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Terra|first1=Leonardo Augusto Amaral|last2=Passador|first2=João Luiz|title=Symbiotic Dynamic: The Strategic Problem from the Perspective of Complexity|journal=Systems Research and Behavioral Science|date=2016|volume=33|issue=2|page=235|doi=10.1002/sres.2379|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sres.2379/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAS are contrasted with ordered and [[chaotic systems]] by the relationship that exists between the system and the agents which act within it.  In an ordered system the level of constraint means that all agent behaviour is limited to the rules of the system. In a chaotic system the agents are unconstrained and susceptible to statistical and other analysis.  In a CAS, the system and the agents co-evolve; the system lightly constrains agent behaviour, but the agents modify the system by their interaction with it. This [[self-organizing]] nature is an important characteristic of CAS; and its ability to learn to adapt, differentiate it from other self organizing systems.&lt;ref name=CAS-T-01/&gt;

== Implications for organizational management ==
CAS approaches to strategy seek to understand the nature of system constraints and agent interaction and generally takes an evolutionary or naturalistic approach to strategy.  Some research integrates [[computer simulation and organizational studies]].

===Complexity theory and knowledge management===
Complexity theory also relates to [[knowledge management]] (KM) and [[organizational learning]] (OL). "Complex systems are, by any other definition, learning organizations."&lt;ref name="CAS-T-28" /&gt; Complexity Theory, KM, and OL are all complimentary and co-dependent.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-28" /&gt; “KM and OL each lack a theory of how cognition happens in human social systems – complexity theory offers this missing piece”.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-28" /&gt;

=== Complexity theory and project management ===
Complexity theory is also being used to better understand new ways of doing [[project management]], as traditional models have been found lacking to current challenges.&lt;ref name="Saynisch 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Saynisch, Manfred|title=Beyond frontiers of traditional project management: An approach to evolutionary, self-organizational principles and the complexity theory—results of the research program|journal=Project Management Journal|volume=41|issue=2|year=2010|pages=21–37|doi=10.1002/pmj.20159}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}} This approaches advocates forming a "culture of trust" that "welcomes outsiders, embraces new ideas, and promotes cooperation."&lt;ref name="Saynisch 2010"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

=== Recommendations for managers ===
Complexity Theory implies approaches that focus on flatter, more flexible organizations, rather than top-down, command-and-control styles of management.&lt;ref name="Burnes, Bernard 2005"/&gt;{{rp|84}}

==Additional examples ==
A typical example for an organization behaving as CAS, is Wikipedia&lt;ref name="CAS-T-11" /&gt; – collaborated and managed by a loosely organized management structure,&lt;ref name="CAS-T-11" /&gt; composed of a complex mix of [[human–computer interaction]]s.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-T-17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-T-18" /&gt; By managing behavior, and not only mere content, Wikipedia uses simple rules to produce a complex, evolving knowledge base which has largely replaced older sources in popular use.

Other examples include the complex [[Macroeconomics|global macroeconomic network]] within a country or group of countries&lt;!--much more complex than mere macroeconomic, any help in redirecting to a better page would be welcomed---&gt;; [[stock market]] and complex web of [[Cross-border_cooperation|cross-border]] [[holding companies]]; [[manufacturing|manufacturing business]]es&lt;!--much more complex than mere manufacturing, any help in rewording would be welcomed---&gt;; and any human social group-based endeavour in a particular [[ideology]] and [[social system]] such as [[political party|political parties]], [[community|communities]], [[geopolitical]] [[organisations]], and [[terrorist network analysis|terrorist networks]] of both hierarchical and [[leaderless resistance|leaderless]] nature.&lt;ref name="GT-33" /&gt;  This new macro level state may create difficulty for an observer in explaining and describing the collective behaviour in terms of its constituent parts; as a result of the complex dynamic networks of interactions, outlined earlier.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-01" /&gt;

'''Design manufacture service''' (DMS) is a [[business model]] that combines contract product design with [[Contract manufacturer|contract manufacturing]] as a service to other companies that have insufficient or do not possess the required resources.  Often the customer is focused on other aspects of their business or their existing resources may simply be overloaded. DMS providers may also provide other services such as order fulfillment, [[logistics]] and [[Aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]] service.

Because of the high skill-levels required in each field, DMS firms specialize in different product categories.  These might include medical devices, medical instruments, automotive, communications, etc.  Typically, these are areas that require a relatively higher level of internal infrastructure or regulatory controls than the customer possesses. Certain industries including aviation and medical devices&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm070642.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; require special development and manufacturing practices required by international, Federal and local regulations.

One of the key differences between the DMS model and other contract manufacturing such as [[original design manufacturer]] (ODM), is the way [[intellectual property]] (IP) is treated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/sme/en/documents/pdf/ip_innovation_development.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In the DMS model, IP comes from three basic sources.  These include (a) IP previously owned and contributed by the customer, (b) IP previously owned and contributed to the product by the DMS and (c) new or original IP created at the request of and paid by the customer.  The latter (c) is commonly referred to as "[[work for hire]]". With DMS, the customer ultimately has rights to all of the IP embodied in the product.  This is especially important in industries like medical devices where customer owned IP is critical.&lt;ref&gt;http://knobbe.com/pdf/2012-August-MEDS-What-Medical-Device-Companies-Need-To-Know-Intellectual-Property.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Some contract product development models, including [[Original design manufacturer|Original Design Manufacturing]] (ODM),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/original-design-manufacturer&lt;/ref&gt; allow the developer, instead of the customer, to retain IP rights.

'''José Eduardo Cavalcanti de Mendonça''', known as '''Duda Mendonça''', ([[Salvador, Brazil]], August 10, 1944) is one of the principal advertising and political strategist specialists in [[Brazil]]. Owner of the agency [https://web.archive.org/web/20090202145828/http://dudapropaganda.com.br/ Duda Propaganda], he became famous for his effective political campaigns, managing more than 55 significant national campaigns, including mayoral, senatorial, gubernatorial and presidential races in more than 20 years of experience.

His work in the 2002 presidential campaign for [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] was widely praised by professionals for its effectiveness. Duda is known as "the man who elected Lula", as it was the fourth time in a row that Lula was seeking to be elected to the highest office position in the country.

In October 2004, he was arrested at an illegal [[cock fighting]] arena in the [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|State of Rio de Janeiro]].[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u100960.shtml]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4396">The '''Export Yellow Pages''' (EYP), was a multi-media trade and promotion resource for exporters that provides U.S. companies, exporters and export related service providers across all industries a convenient way to engage in [[export|export promotion]] and establish contacts and conduct business and trade around the globe with international buyers. Through the EYP, the Department of Commerce offers all U.S. companies and service providers a free online and print business directory listing and access to the directory and multi-media export. The Export Yellow Pages is located at http://www.exportyellowpages.com.

The Export Yellow Pages is no longer published.

==History==

The Export Yellow Pages was created in 1993 under the Bush Administration as a Public Private Partnership in partnership with Delphos International. Under its leadership of Bill Delphos and Donald Burley the publication was distributed worldwide to 210 countries with the US Department of Commerce and other government agencies distributing the directory to foreign buyers looking to purchase American made goods and services. 

The Export Yellow Pages print and online directory detailed products and services of over 27,000 U.S. companies representing over 65,000 business categories, as well as offers access to U.S. company executives, product catalogs, news and other export related information and resources. The website is no longer fully functional.

Connections and links to the Department of Commerce and other U.S. government international trade offices and agencies and resources are also presented at the Export Yellow Pages [http://www.exportyellowpages.com] to further assist U.S. companies and foreign buyers in navigating international trade opportunities and processes.  This website and searches on it may not reliably work anymore.

==Export Related Agencies==

* [[Department of Commerce]] (USDOC)

The mission of the USDOC is to "promote job creation and improved living standards for all Americans by creating an infrastructure that promotes economic growth, technological competitiveness, and sustainable development." Among its tasks are gathering economic and demographic data for business and government decision-making, issuing patents and trademarks, and helping to set industrial standards.

*[[International Trade Administration]] (ITA)

The International Trade Administration is an agency in the United States Department of Commerce that promotes United States exports of nonagricultural U.S. services and goods.

*[[Foreign Agricultural Service]] (FAS)

The Foreign Agricultural Service has primary responsibility for the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) overseas programs—market development, international trade agreements and negotiations, and the collection of statistics and market information. The FAS assists U.S. exporters of agricultural products. It also administers USDA's export credit guarantee and food aid programs and helps increase income and food availability in developing nations by mobilizing expertise for agriculturally led economic growth. 

*[[Export-Import Bank of the United States]] (Ex-Im Bank)

Ex-Im Bank is the official export credit agency of the United States federal government. It is an independent agency in the Executive branch established by Congress in 1934 for the purposes of financing and insuring foreign purchases of United States goods for customers unable or unwilling to accept credit risk. ''The mission of the Bank is to create and sustain U.S. jobs by financing sales of U.S. exports to international buyers.'' Ex-Im Bank does not compete with private sector lenders, but rather provides financing for transactions that would otherwise not take place because commercial lenders are either unable or unwilling to accept the political or commercial risks inherent in the deal.

==Early life, background and education==
Mandl was born in [[Wien]] as the fourth child of a wealthy [[Jew]]ish family.&lt;ref name=jl&gt;{{cite news|author1=S. Ciboci|author2=I. Rimac|coauthors=|title=Židov koji je svima bio neprijatelj|trans-title=Jew who was an enemy to everyone|pages=|publisher=[[Jutarnji list]]|date=2008-01-15|url=https://www.jutarnji.hr/arhiva/zidov-koji-je-svima-bio-neprijatelj/3286382/|accessdate=2018-01-22|quote= Felix Mandl, imućni Židov i vlasnik cementare u Podsusedu.("Felix Mandl, wealthy Jew and owner of the cement plant in Podsused.")|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied agriculture and philosophy in [[Göttingen]] at the [[University of Göttingen]].

==Career==
Mandl's grandfather founded a cement plant in 1867, which had a branch plant in [[Podsused – Vrapče|Podsused]], district of [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]. Later that plant was turned from craft into a corporation with headquarters in [[Zurich]]. Mandl was supposed to move to Zurich, but with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s rise to power, he changed his mind.&lt;ref name=jl/&gt; Plant in Podsused was named ''"Croatia"''.&lt;ref name=jl/&gt;

During the [[World War II]] he moved to Zagreb from where he guided the plant in Podsused. Soon he became a victim of political regimes. When the [[Ustaše|Ustashe]] came to power in Croatia, they began to threaten him with murder because he was a Jew. His plant was taken away from him by [[Independent State of Croatia|NDH]] regime. Mandl ended up in jail due to listening the [[BBC radio]] program, which was banned at the time.&lt;ref name=jl/&gt; He was also arrested by the [[Gestapo]], but was released after five days due to "economic reasons", while other prisoners that were with Mandl in detention were sent to [[Nazi concentration camps]].&lt;ref name=jl/&gt; After the war Mandl was tried by the communist regime of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] for alleged collaboration with the fascist government, which was never proven. He was sentenced to ten years of forced labor. Mandl was taken to [[Lepoglava prison]], from which he was released after two years when it was discovered that during the war he helped a [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] fighters.&lt;ref name=jl/&gt;

In the [[nationalization]] by the communist regime, Mandl was left without any factory, except the one in Podsused, which was later renamed to ''"Sloboda"'', but was soon afterwards destroyed.&lt;ref name=jl/&gt;

In Kenya in 1951 Mandl founded [[Bamburi Cement]], one of largest cement companies in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kendir.com/bamburi-cement.html|title=Kenya Business Directory|publisher=|work=www.kendir.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107051355/http://www.kendir.com/bamburi-cement.html|archivedate=2010-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Mandl was married to Ana Bing from 1931. During World War II he had sent his wife to [[Budapest]], out of a fear that Zagreb was no longer safe for her. Mandl's wife returned to Zagreb after a month, although the threat still existed. While in prison in Lepoglava, Mandl had regularly visits from his wife. On December 5, 1950 Mandl and his wife emigrated to [[Kenya]].&lt;ref name=jl/&gt;

Mandl wrote the book ''"Usprkos svemu ostaju sjećanja (In spite of all the memories remain)"'', in which he described his life.

He is currently a member of the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]].

==Business life==
De Narváez arrived in Argentina at the age of three. His father was a Colombian coffee merchant. His mother's family owned the [[Almacenes Tía]] chain of supermarkets, started by his grandfather, Karel Steuer, in [[Eastern Europe]] as 'Te-Ta'. Upon relocating to South America, it became a major chain. De Narváez began work there at the age of 17 years and was appointed Chief Executive in 1989, a position which he held for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.franciscodenarvaez.com/conozcame_biografia.htm |title=Bio |accessdate=November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Narváez eventually sold the Argentinean division of the company in 2002&lt;ref name=derf&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.derf.com.ar/despachos.asp?cod_des=50439 |date=November 27, 2005 |accessdate=November 14, 2012 |title=Francisco de Narváez: "Macri no cree en los partidos políticos tradicionales y yo sí" |publisher=Grupo Derf |author=Daniel Leñini}}&lt;/ref&gt; for $638 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2007/05/13/noticia_0018.html |title=Francisco De Narváez: "No voy a votar a Kirchner" |date=May 13, 2007 |accessdate=November 14, 2012 |publisher=''[[Perfil]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francisco de Narváez was elected as a National Deputy for Buenos Aires Province in 2005, the first foreigner to be elected to the Chamber. In 2006 de Narváez took the side of agriculture workers against the Argentinian government over efforts to either ban certain meat exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.agencianova.com/nota.asp?n=2006_12_8&amp;id=36099&amp;id_tiponota=4 |title=Francisco De Narváez: "El Gobierno recibió en Misiones un tsunami de votos" |date=December 8, 2006 |accessdate=November 14, 2012 |publisher=''Nova''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also spoken out about the nationalization of private industry in many other areas of governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.diaadia.com.ar/content/francisco-de-narvaez-amanece-repartiendo-boletas |title=Francisco De Narváez amanece repartiendo boletas |date=June 26, 2009 |accessdate=November 14, 2012 |publisher=''Día a Día''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:De Narvaez at Gran Cuñado.jpg|thumb|left|Francisco de Narvaez appearance at [[Gran Cuñado]].]]
As a centre-right pro business politician, he supported the senatorial bid of [[Hilda de Duhalde]] and sits with dissident [[Peronist]]s in Congress, opposed to the government of the [[Kirchnerism|Kirchners]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noticias.uol.com.ar/edicion_1502/nota_00.htm Peronismo Ca$h] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stood to be governor of the province in 2007, gaining over a million votes. Jorge Macri, cousin of [[Mauricio Macri]], was his running mate and their campaign was supported by Macri's party [[Commitment to Change]] and the [[Republican Proposal|PRO]] coalition. De Narváez mentioned to the press in November 2012 that he would be interested in forming a similar coalition in the upcoming 2013 election season as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1524285-de-narvaez-apoyara-una-eventual-candidatura-de-macri-en-la-provincia |title=De Narváez apoyará una eventual candidatura de Macri en la provincia |date=November 7, 2012 |accessdate=November 14, 2012 |publisher=''[[La Nación]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his campaigns, de Narváez is known for self-financing his campaigns, using his own money to pursue his political interests.&lt;ref name=MFiore&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2009/7/12/politica-434801.asp |title=Los negocios políticos y económicos de De Narváez en Mendoza |date=July 12, 2009 |accessdate=November 14, 2012 |author=Mario Fiore |publisher=''[[Los Andes (newspaper)|Los Andes]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 2009, de Narváez defeated former president Nestór Kirchner in the legislative midterm elections in the province of Buenos Aires. During the electoral campaign he took part of the humoristic TV show [[Gran Cuñado]], which included parodies of the most important politicians of Argentina (including De Narváez himself), and engaged with his parody in stage jokes. This act generated controversy in the media about the effects on his actual electoral performance: columnists like Joaquín Morales Solá claim he was benefited from it,&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1141009 La sátira que desnuda un vacío de ideas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706081607/http://m.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1141009 |date=2011-07-06 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other think that such influence was relative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elargentino.com/nota-46584-Gran-Cunado-y-la-intencion-de-voto.html El efecto de Gran Cuñado sobre la intención de voto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627112321/http://www.elargentino.com/nota-46584-Gran-Cunado-y-la-intencion-de-voto.html |date=2009-06-27 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francisco de Narváez says that Gran Cuñado helped him,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lu22radiotandil.com.ar/2009/07/25/de-narvaez-tengo-mas-plata-que-los-kirchner/ De Narváez: “Tengo más plata que los Kirchner”] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it helped to humanize the image of politicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1135996 La visita de De Narváez a "Gran Cuñado", al ritmo del reggaeton] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also ran the campaign in Buenos Aires as part of a political alliance between himself, [[Chief of Government of the City of Buenos Aires]] [[Mauricio Macri]] and former [[Governor of Buenos Aires]] [[Felipe Solá]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1098775-acuerdo-entre-sola-macri-y-narvaez-de-cara-a-octubre |title=Acuerdo entre Solá, Macri y Narváez de cara a octubre |date=February 11, 2009 |accessdate=November 14, 2012 |publisher=''[[La Nación]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 de Narváez introduced a bill to the Argentinian legislature to increase the universal child allowance from 180 pesos to 250. The bill was targeted at alleviating child poverty, and to correlate the allowance with wage inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lanueva.com/hoy/nota/edebb64bcc/1/68323.html |date=July 8, 2010 |accessdate=November 14, 2012 |title=Francisco De Narváez impulsa un proyecto para que la Asignación por Hijo pase a 250 pesos |publisher=Diario La Nueva Provincia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 de Narváez ran for office with the UDESO as a gubernatorial candidate in the Buenoes Aires province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lanoticia1.com/noticia/elecciones-2011-de-narvaez-apunta-a-aglutinar-a-la-oposicion-20997.html |title=Elecciones 2011: De Narváez apunta a aglutinar a la oposición |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=April 25, 2013 |publisher=''La Noticia 1''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012 de Narváez began national calls for the formation of a new coalition to remove the majority coalition from power in Argentina, naming Peronist dissidents, the PRO, and others as potential members of a new ruling coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lacapital.com.ar/ed_impresa/2012/10/edicion_1452/contenidos/noticia_5451.html |title=De Narváez pide un frente de unidad nacional |date=October 27, 2012 |accessdate=November 14, 2012 |publisher=''Diario La Capital''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been particularly critical of the national government in its handling of civil security and the country's problem with crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=La inseguridad es una realidad y un problema nacional |date=November 12, 2012 |accessdate=November 14, 2012 |url=http://www.minutouno.com/notas/267966-la-inseguridad-es-una-realidad-y-un-problema-nacional |publisher=''Minutouno''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1666">'''Functional management''' is the most common type of organizational [[management]].  The organization is grouped by areas of speciality within different functional areas (e.g., finance, marketing, and engineering).  Some refer to a functional area as a "silo". Besides the heads of a firm's product and/or geographic units the company's top management team typically consists of several functional heads such as the chief financial officer, the chief operating officer, and the [[chief strategy officer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jom.sagepub.com/content/38/1/45.abstract Menz, M. 2012. Functional Top Management Team Members: A Review, Synthesis, and Research Agenda. Journal of Management, 38(1): 45-80.]&lt;/ref&gt; Communication generally occurs within a single department.  If information or project work is needed from another department, a request is transmitted up to the department head, who communicates the request to the other department head.  Otherwise, communication stays within the department.  Team members complete project work in addition to normal department work.

The main advantage of this type of organization is that each employee has only one manager, thus simplifying the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmhut.com/organization-structures-in-project-management Organization Structures in Project Management]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gruppi di Acquisto Solidale''''' ('''G.A.S.''', Italian for '''ethical purchasing groups''') are an [[Italy|Italian]]-based system of purchasing goods collectively. These groups are usually set up by a number of consumers who cooperate in order to buy food and other commonly used goods directly from producers or from big retailers at a price that is fair to both parties.

==The meaning of the word ''Solidale'' (Solidal)==
When a buying group does not search for the ultimate discounted rate, but instead puts people and environment before profit the group becomes a Solidal buyers group. As a consequence, in a Solidal buying group the guidelines in the choice of the products and the producers are respect for the environment and the solidarity between the members of the group, the traders and the producers.

These guidelines lead to the choice of local products (in order to minimize the environmental impact of the transport), fair-trade goods (in order to respect disadvantaged producers by promoting their human rights, in particular those of women, children and indigenous people) and reusable or eco-compatible goods (to promote a sustainable lifestyle).

==Motivation==
Each individual group has its own specific motivations, but most groups are rooted in a critical approach to the [[global economy|global economic model]] and consumer lifestyle; individuals that feel the unfairness in this model and are searching for a practical alternative can find reciprocal aid and advice by joining solidal buying groups.

Often, when a group of friends develop a tendency toward a less [[consumerism|consumerist]] way of life, the idea of undertaking shared purchasing initiatives comes naturally. When the idea begins to develop into something more tangible, a fair amount of effort is needed in order to find local producers that meet the solidarity criteria; the final step is to establish an internal structure in the group in order to collect orders and redistribute the products.

'''Heat setting''' is a term used in the [[textile industry]] to describe a thermal process taking place mostly in either a steam atmosphere or a [[dry heat]] environment.  The effect of the process gives [[fiber]]s, [[yarn]]s or fabric dimensional stability and, very often, other desirable attributes like higher volume, wrinkle resistance or temperature resistance. Very often, heat setting is also used to improve attributes for subsequent processes. Yarns tend to have increased torquing just after spinning, cabling or twisting. Heat setting can influence or even eliminate this tendency to undesirable torquing. At the winding, twisting, weaving, [[tufting]] and knitting processes, an increased tendency to torquing can cause difficulties in processing the yarn. When using heat setting for carpet [[yarn]]s, desirable results include not only the diminishing of torquing but also the stabilization or fixing of the fiber thread.  Both twist stabilization and stabilization of frieze effect are results of the heat setting process.  Heat setting benefits staple yarns as well as bulked continuous filament (BCF) yarns. Heat setting often causes synthetic fibers to gain volume as well.  This volume growth is commonly described as "bulk development".  All processes using temperature and/or moisture to give textiles one of the above-mentioned attributes are known as heat setting. The term "thermal fixation" is used less frequently. In the carpet industry, the process is exclusively called "heat setting".

== Crinkling tendency ==

The crinkle tendency is due to the technological conditions of the spun [[yarn]] production
and the physical [[fiber]] properties. Above all, the "technological conditions of the
spun yarn production" means the turning moment of the thread. A twisted thread will always
try to twist when it hangs freely between two fixed points in the form of a loop. In doing this, it gives up a part of its original twist which becomes spirals whose twisting direction is opposite to the original twist direction. This development of twist in the opposite direction occurs as the twisted yarn attempts to reach equilibrium.
[[File:Power-Heat-Set-2Fadenspannun-e.jpg|thumb|diagram by Müller]]

Twisting in the opposite direction is due to the tensions resulting from the yarn twisting that Mueller indicated in the diagram of tension and pressure. The total tension acting against the twisting is increased in relation to increased
twisting due to the increasing tension and pressure of the bundle of fibres in the yarn. It may become so strong that the thread core buckles when it can no longer withstand the compressive strains. The yarn curls, meaning that the yarn tries to reach a state of equilibrium in which twists in the opposite direction from the original twist direction balance the yarn's torque.These twists are also called negative twists. In this state of equilibrium, the inner torsional tensions cancel each other out. The thread always buckles at a spot where the cross section is small due to the unevenness of the thread. During the spinning process this spot took up more twists and is therefore subjected to higher inner tensions, which ultimately break the thread core. Although thicker yarns are less twisted than fine ones, the inner tension rises opposite to the yarn size. Smaller yarn is more weakened by steaming. Further positive aspects of steaming are the reduction of curling and, at the same time, the setting of the physical properties of closeness and extension imparted to the yarn by twisting.

== The chemical process ==

There are completely different behaviors depending on the kind of yarn material. Much is known about the steaming of woolen yarns but more research is needed on the steaming behaviour of artificial fibers and cotton.

=== Wool ===

As soon as steam enters, the [[yarns]] quantity of moisture rises at once, caused by the heating of the yarn and by steam condensation. According to Speakmann the following phenomena can be seen in the stretched woolen fiber: The cystine side chains are subjected to a hydrolysis at the sulphur bridge, where cystine is dissolved into cysteine and a not yet isolated sulphonic acid.
[[Image:Heatsetting wool.svg|left|thumb|500px|Physical and chemical forces between two polypeptide chains&lt;br/&gt;
1. Hydrogen bridges between peptide groups (polar bond)&lt;br/&gt;
2. Cystine bridge (covalent bond)&lt;br/&gt;
3. Salt bridge between two amino acids (ionic bond)&lt;br/&gt;
4. Hydrophobic bond between a valine and an isolyeine rest (non-polar bond)&lt;br/&gt;
The broken ellipse shows the part where water is displaced.]]
An ionization can be seen at the bridges that were produced from salt liberation. Due to the increase of temperature in the fibers during steaming an oscillation of the molecules is produced which leads to the bursting of the hydrogen bridges; now residual valencies are set free which are able to saturate with the dipole water. The water then acts like a lubrication between the individual molecules. Thus the bonds of the main chains between each other are dissolved by the side chains, the individual polypeptide chains can shift against each other and the tensions find their equilibrium (see illustration 4). When the steaming of the yarn is continued, new side chains are formed between the individual components of the main chains. When finally the yarn is dried, i.e. the moisture balance occurring within the yarn, salt is liberated again and hydrogen bridges are formed. Now the individual polypeptide chains can no longer be shifted against each other and the fibers regained their former closeness, however without having remarkable tensions inside.

The yarn or doubled yarn twist is set. Of course, the morphological structure of the fibers must be considered when equalizing the tensions by steaming. Since the woolen fiber very quickly gets the temperature for breaking up the hydrogen bridges and the steam for hydrolysing the cystine bridges, a relatively quick twist modification is possible which roughly corresponds to the values of an autoclave moderated yarn; however, the steaming quality of the Steamatic steaming process is much better with reference to the evenness of moisture absorption.

=== Synthetic fiber ===

[[File:Power-Heat-SettingFestigkei.svg|thumb|Fiber strength and elongation&lt;br/&gt;1. amorphous fiber domains&lt;br/&gt;2. crystalline fiber domains&lt;br/&gt;3. bonding force]]Synthetic fibers can be divided up into two fiber domains, the crystalline (organized) domain and the amorphous (unorganized) domain. In crystalline domains physical forces of attraction are acting between the closely parallel lines of [[polymer]]s. These forces acting transversely to the fiber axis make up the closeness of a fiber. If tension is applied to the fiber, these forces hinder the fiber from breaking.

In contrast, the amorphous fiber domains act like links of the fibers. They are responsible for the flexional strength of the fibers. Additionally, the amorphous fiber domains make it possible for water or dye to enter.
[[File:Power-Heat-Set-Amorphe-Fase-e.jpg|left|Properties of amorphous and crystalline fiber domains]]
During steaming, the heating of the fiber causes  its molecules to start oscillating. The increase of oscillation that can be influenced by the degree and the period of heating dissolves the electric bond forces in the fiber; at first in the amorphous domains, later in the crystalline ones and at last in the polymers. As with wool, the tensions brought in by [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] are set free. During drying or cooling of the [[fiber]], the binding forces are rebuilt without having tensions in the inner part.

The problem of [[synthetic fiber]]s is that the reduction of the binding forces only takes place between the so-called deformation point (start of changing the firm  solidified – amorphous fiber domains into a visco-elastic – easily deformable state) and the distortion point (the crystalline fiber domains change into a visco-elastic state, too) which is in a relatively high temperature range.

This is also an explanation for the fact that wool mixed with synthetic fibers is more difficult to set than pure wool. Setting synthetic fibers is only possible beyond a temperature range of 85 to 95 °C. In contrast, pure wool can set very well at these temperatures.

=== Cotton ===

In in-line steaming, cotton plays a more or less subordinate role. The exact physical or chemical process in the fiber are not well known.

== Applications in the carpet industry ==

The quality of cut pile carpets is improved significantly by a reduction of inner tensions in the yarn.  This essential benefit results from the effects of steaming and heatsetting.

=== Carpet classification ===

Carpet styles are divided into two basic types. These types are loop pile carpets and cut pile carpets. Especially for cut-pile and its variations (Saxony, shag, frieze) the heat setting process is of highest importance.

=== Tip definition (pinpoint tip definition) ===

[[File:Power-Heat-Set Tip Definition2.jpg|thumb|"Pinpoint tip definition" after Heatsetting]]
Usually, when yarn is cut, the ends fray similar to the way the ends of a braid or rope would fray when they are cut and a kind of a brush forms. This fraying must be avoided in cut-pile carpets by all means. A cut pile carpet with frayed yarn ends would have a poor appearance, a shorter life cycle and ergonomic disadvantages for the "walker" as scientific research has proven. The carpet is less elastic and doesn't absorb the steps of the user as well as a heat set carpet would. A carpet manufactured from heat set yarn is more attractive, durable and comfortable for the user.  The added value of heatset carpet is significant. Normally a heat set carpet can be identified by its grainy structure, which is called "pinpoint tip definition" in the industry. The appearance of the cut pile ends is similar to pin points.

== Current heat setting processes ==

Several different heat setting processes are known in the textile industry. The most important are presented here.

=== Autoclave heat setting ===
[[File:Autoclav 2.jpg|thumb|right|Autoclave Heatsetting]]
The oldest heat setting process is autoclave heat setting. Mostly, it is a discontinuous process.Autoclave installations use vacuum and/or pressure. Textile material is brought into the autoclave either on bobbins, in skeins or loose in a container. As nearly all autoclaves are exposed to certain pressures they are usually built in cylindrical shape and mounted horizontally. Most commonly, autoclaves are loaded and unloaded from the end of the cylinder but some may be loaded from one end and unloaded from the other end. Autoclaves mounted vertically exist but are less common.
They are mostly used for the synthetic yarns like polyester, polyethylene, poly propylene and nylons.

=== Steamatic process ===
For automation in link spinning/winding there is the so-called "in-line steamer". The first known process of this type is the Steamatic process by Resch. In this case the heat setting process happens in between the ring spinning and the winding machines. As soon as the ring spinning frame has finished spinning, the loaded bobbins are transported into the in-line steamer. Those bobbins are steamed there with a vacuum method and dried again within seconds. After steaming and drying, the bobbins are transported on to the winding machine where they are re-wound onto a cross-wound package.

The carpet industry currently utilizes two continuous processes, the Power-Heat-Set process and the TVP process which was derived from the autoclave technology.

=== Power-Heat-Set technology ===
The Power-Heat-Set process, formerly known as Suessen process, was developed in the beginning of the 1970s and was the first continuous heat setting system worldwide. The process itself was revolutionary in that it was the first system not operated with saturated steam and pressure, but with a superheated steam/airmix at atmospheric pressure. Using this innovative technology, completely new carpet collections were created. In the Power-Heat-Set process, the yarns and filaments oxidize slightly on the surface due to the existing oxygen in the surrounding atmosphere and the higher temperatures. This capillary oxide film causes the complete carpet later to be more stain resistant. Dirt particles adhere less to the fibers.

=== SUPERBA TVP process ===

In addition to the Power-Heat-Set technology there is the SUPERBA TVP3 process which is also a continuous process. In the TVP3 process yarn is placed on a conveyor belt and inserted through a lock into a pressure tunnel that could be up to 15 m long.  Inside the tunnel, it undergoes a heat setting process with saturated steam. At the end of the tunnel the yarn is taken out through a second lock. The yarn which is still hot and moist is dried and cooled after heat setting and fed to the winding process. Up to 72 yarn ends can be processed at the same time.

== Process description (exemplary with the Power-Heat-Set process) ==

[[File:Power-Heat-Set-GVA-Auslauf.jpg|thumb|Frieze and straight Yarn after Power-Heat-Setting]]
In the Power-Heat-Set process yarn is heat set with superheated steam in an open system at atmospheric pressure. All the materials normally used in the carpet industry such as polyamide 6, polyamide 6.6, polypropylene, Acrylic, PET, polyester and wool can be processed.

The unprocessed yarn is provided on packages in a creel (up to 72 packages). At a speed of up to 700 m/min, the yarn is pulled off the packages and entered into the heat setting process. There are two basic ways of transportation of the yarn through the process. One way is to place the yarn in coils or a "figure 8 pattern on a belt or to wrap it onto ropes arranged as a polygon in order to convey it through the process. With Frieze yarns only belt conveying is utilized. Frieze is produced by a special stuffer box, the so-called Twinroll-Box (TRB).
The heat setting process takes place at temperatures between 110 °C and 200 °C in a steam-air-mix. After heat setting, the yarn is cooled and wound onto packages again at the winder. In general a heat setting machine consists of six lines at eight ends (fibers) each. A daily production of up to 10.5 tons is possible.

'''Investor-state dispute settlement''' ('''ISDS''') or '''investment court system''' ('''ICS''') is a system through which investors can sue countries for alleged discriminatory practices. ISDS is an instrument of [[public international law]] and provisions are contained in a number of [[Bilateral Investment Treaty|bilateral investment treaties]], in certain international [[trade treaty|trade treaties]], such as [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] (chapter 11), and the proposed [[Trans-Pacific Partnership|TPP]] (chapter 9) and [[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement|CETA]] (sections 3 and 4) agreements. ISDS is also found in [[international investment agreement]]s, such as the [[Energy Charter Treaty]]. If an investor from one country (the "home state") invests in another country (the "host state"), both of which have agreed to ISDS, and the host state violates the rights granted to the investor under the treaty, then that investor may bring the matter before an [[arbitral tribunal]].

While ISDS is often associated with [[international arbitration]] under the rules of ICSID (the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] of the [[World Bank]]), it often takes place under the auspices of international arbitral tribunals governed by different rules or institutions, such as the [[London Court of International Arbitration]], the [[International Chamber of Commerce]], the [[Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre]] or the [[UNCITRAL]] Arbitration Rules.

== Foreign investment protection ==
=== Historical development ===
Under [[customary international law]] a state can vindicate injury caused to its nation by the host state by exercising [[diplomatic protection]], which may include [[retorsion]] and/or [[reprisals]]. In addition to diplomatic protection and to avoid having to resort to coercive means, states can and do establish ad hoc commissions and [[arbitral tribunal]]s to adjudicate claims involving treatment of foreign nationals and their property by the Host State ("state-state-dispute-settlement", SSDS). Notable examples of this practice are the [[Jay Treaty]] commissions, the [[Iran–United States Claims Tribunal]] and the [[American-Mexican Claims Commission]].&lt;ref name="NewcombeParadell" /&gt; However, these treaties were limited to the treatment of foreign investors during a past period of time, whereas modern ISDS allows investors to make claims against states in general and on a prospective basis.

=== Modern practice ===
Currently, the legal protection of [[Foreign Direct Investment]] under [[public international law]] is guaranteed by a network of more than 2750 [[Bilateral Investment Treaty|bilateral investment treaties]] (BITs), Multilateral Investment Treaties, most notably the [[Energy Charter Treaty]] and number of Free Trade Agreements such as [[NAFTA]] containing a chapter on investment protection. Most of these treaties were signed by states in the late 1980s and early 1990s, before the current explosion of investor claims under the treaties began in the late 1990s.

The majority of these legal instruments provides foreign investors with a substantive legal protection (including the right to "fair and equitable treatment", "full protection and security", "free transfer of means" and the right not to be directly or indirectly expropriated without full compensation) and access to ISDS for redress against Host States for breaches of such protection. Some of these standards are framed in vague terms, given extensive discretion to arbitrators in their interpretation and application. The overall number of known cases reached over 500 in 2012. Of these, 244 were concluded, of which approximately 42% were decided in favour of the Host State and approximately 31% in favour of the investor. Approximately 27% of the cases were settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/webdiaepcb2013d3_en.pdf|format=PDF|title=Recent Developments in Investor-State Disputes|publisher=Unctad.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:NAFTA logo.png|right|150px|thumb|Chapter 11 of [[NAFTA]] includes an Investor-State provision.]]

Notably, only foreign investors can sue states under investment treaties, because states are the parties to the treaty, and only states can be held liable to pay damages for breach of the treaty. States have no corresponding right to bring an original claim against a foreign investor under such treaties, again because investors are not parties to the treaty and therefore cannot be in breach of it. Thus, a decision in favour of the State means that the state has not been ordered to pay compensation, not that it has received any compensation from the investor, although costs can be awarded against the investor. A state cannot "win" in ISDS in the manner of a foreign investor - a state which wishes to sue a foreign investor does so through its own domestic courts, without the need for a treaty.

ISDS cannot overturn local laws (unlike the [[World Trade Organization]]) which violate trade agreements,&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://piie.com/publications/piie-briefings/assessing-trans-pacific-partnership-volume-1-market-access-and-sectoral|title=Assessing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Volume 1: Market Access and Sectoral Issues {{!}} PIIE|website=piie.com|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibanet.org/Document/Default.aspx?DocumentUid=f30e1893-08fb-4c8e-93bd-eac8442faf5e|title=Investor-state dispute settlement: the importance of an informed, fact-based debate|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=International Bar Association|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but can grant monetary damages to investors adversely affected by such laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/10/obscure-legal-system-lets-corportations-sue-states-ttip-icsid|title=The obscure legal system that lets corporations sue countries|date=10 June 2015|publisher=The Guardian|author=Claire Provost and Matt Kennard|accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]], ISDS requires specific treaty violations, and does not allow corporations to sue solely over "lost profits".&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/blog/2015/march/isds-important-questions-and-answers|title=ISDS: Important Questions and Answers {{!}} United States Trade Representative|website=ustr.gov|access-date=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such violations may be difficult to foresee, and the threat of exorbitant fines may cause a [[chilling effect]] which halts regulation or legislation in the public interest (e.g. human health and environmental protection).&lt;ref name="SCint"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/933590566|title=Shadow courts : the tribunals that rule global trade|last=Sweetland,|first=Edwards, Haley|publisher=Colombia Global Reports|year=2016|isbn=9780997126402|location=|pages=Chapter: Introduction|oclc=933590566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also state that treaties are written so that any legislation causing lost profits is per definition a treaty violation, rendering the argument null that only treaty violations are subject to ISDS.&lt;ref name="SCint"/&gt;

==== NAFTA Chapter 11 ====
{{main|North American Free Trade Agreement}}
A notable example of ISDS, which has been in existence for two decades now, is Chapter 11 of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). NAFTA Chapter 11 allows investors of one NAFTA party (Canada, United States or Mexico) to bring claims directly against the government of another NAFTA party before an international [[arbitral tribunal]]. Because NAFTA Article 1121 waives the local remedies rule, investors are not required to exhaust local remedies before filing Chapter 11 claims. While this fact has been amply criticized in public, proponents of ISDS tend to point out that speedy dispute resolution through ISDS is critical in modern economic environments and would be defeated by adding several instances of local remedies. On the other hand, there is no other situation in international law where a private party can sue a state without showing that the state's domestic courts are not independent or reliable. The removal of the customary duty to exhaust local remedies, where they are reasonably available, is claimed to be a factor in the explosion of investment treaty claims since the late 1990s, although a more obvious explanation is the explosion in the number of bilateral free trade agreements since the breakdown of the multilateral WTO Doha round in the mid 2000s.

Investors may initiate an arbitration against the NAFTA Party under the Arbitration Rules of the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law]] ("UNCITRAL Rules") or under the Rules of the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] ("ICSID Rules"). NAFTA Chapter 11 was the first instance of an ISDS provision receiving widespread public attention, especially in the United States in the wake of the [[Methanex]] case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/s/l/c5818.htm|title=Methanex Corp. v. United States of America|publisher=State.gov|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TTIP ===
Resistance from the EU side to the US proposal to include an ISDS clause in the draft [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership]] treaty was such as to cause this element to be abandoned in September 2015. In its place, the [[European Commission]] proposed an investment court system (ICS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/economic/130297|title=EU proposes new trade court with US|last=Nielsen|first=Nikolaj|date=16 September 2015|website=EUobserver|access-date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/eu-unit/Global/eu-unit/reports-briefings/2016/2016_02_11_Greenpeace%20Position%20Paper%20ICS_Final.pdf|title=From ISDS to ICS: A Leopard Can't Change Its Spots|date=11 February 2016|publisher=Greenpeace Position Paper|page=1|access-date=23 February 2016|author=Greenpeace}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5651_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Not long afterwards, ICS was declared illegal by the German Association of Magistrates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/economic/132142|title=TTIP investor court illegal, say German judges|last=Nielsen|first=Nikolaj|date=4 February 2016|website=EUobserver|access-date=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the Commission dismissed the magistrates' judgement as based on a misunderstanding.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/economic/132295|title=EU defends TTIP investor court after German backlash|last=Nielsen|first=Nikolaj|date=17 February 2016|website=EUobserver|access-date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For its part, the United States wants ISDS reinstated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Opponents argue that investor state claims (or the threat of them) inhibit the capacity of domestic governments to pass legislation addressing perfectly legitimate public concerns, such as health and environmental protection, labour rights or human rights.&lt;ref name="StiglitzOct5"&gt;{{Citation|last=Stiglitz|first=Joseph|title=Opinion: The Trans-Pacific Partnership charade: TPP isn't about 'free' trade at all|date=5 October 2015|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-trans-pacific-partnership-charade-tpp-isnt-about-free-trade-at-all-2015-10-05|last2=Hersh|first2=Adam S.|author-link=Joseph Stiglitz|publisher=MarketWatch|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StiglitzOct27"&gt;{{Citation|last=Goodman|first=Amy|title=Joseph Stiglitz: Under TPP, Polluters Could Sue U.S. for Setting Carbon Emissions Limits|date=27 October 2015|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2015/10/27/joseph_stiglitz_under_tpp_polluters_could|last2=Stiglitz|first2=Joseph|author-link=Amy Goodman|accessdate=27 October 2015|author-link2=Joseph Stiglitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THP11Nov2015JSOTPP"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-sachs/tpp-flawed-vote-congress_b_8534286.html Why the TPP Is Too Flawed for a 'Yes' Vote in Congress] J.

Proponents of ISDS argue that governments retain their regulatory ability, if the agreements in question specify that regulations protecting health, the environment, labour rights and human rights are allowed. The [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]] challenges the notion that ISDS challenges "the sovereign ability of governments impose any measure they wish to protect labor rights, the environment, or other issues of public welfare".&lt;ref name=":152"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/blog/2015/march/isds-important-questions-and-answers|title=ISDS: Important Questions and Answers {{!}} United States Trade Representative|website=ustr.gov|access-date=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Bar Association|International Bar Association (IBA)]] mirrors these sentiments, noting that "while investment treaties limit states’ ability to inflict arbitrary or discriminatory treatment, they do not limit (and, in fact, expressly safeguard) a state’s sovereign right to regulate in the public interest in a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory manner."&lt;ref name=":272"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibanet.org/Document/Default.aspx?DocumentUid=f30e1893-08fb-4c8e-93bd-eac8442faf5e|title=Investor-state dispute settlement: the importance of an informed, fact-based debate|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=International Bar Association|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[White House Office|White House]] notes that investment protections are a component of more than 3,000 trade agreements, the vast majority of which have some form of neutral arbitration.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/02/26/investor-state-dispute-settlement-isds-questions-and-answers|title=Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) Questions and Answers|date=26 February 2015|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States is party to at least 50 such agreements, has only faced 13 ISDS cases and never lost an ISDS case.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

The [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] claims that ISDS provisions are necessary, as they boost investment: "empirical evidence has shown that treaties including these provisions have a positive effect on foreign direct investment (FDI) flows between signatory countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://piie.com/blogs/trade-investment-policy-watch/what-do-data-say-about-relationship-between-investor-state|title=What Do the Data Say about the Relationship between Investor-State Dispute Settlement Provisions and FDI? {{!}} PIIE|website=piie.com|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; PIIE challenges the claim that ISDS "arbitrators lack integrity", noting that arbitrators take an oath of impartiality and both sides of a case choose arbitrators.&lt;ref name=":232"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://piie.com/publications/piie-briefings/assessing-trans-pacific-partnership-volume-1-market-access-and-sectoral|title=Assessing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Volume 1: Market Access and Sectoral Issues {{!}} PIIE|website=piie.com|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a February 2016 op-ed against the TPP, Senator [[Elizabeth Warren]] used the example of a French company suing Egypt because Egypt raised its minimum wage as an argument against the ISDS provisions of the TPP.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Washington Post editorial board has however challenged this characterization of the case, noting that "[[Veolia]] of France, a waste management company, invoked ISDS to enforce a contract with the government of [[Alexandria|Alexandria, Egypt]], that it says required compensation if costs increased; the company maintains that the wage increases triggered this provision. Incidentally, Veolia was working with Alexandria on a [[World Bank]]-supported project to reduce greenhouse gases, not some corporate plot to exploit the people. The case — which would result, at most, in a monetary award to Veolia, not the overthrow of the minimum wage — remains in litigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dont-buy-the-trade-deal-alarmism/2015/03/11/41575fee-c1d5-11e4-9271-610273846239_story.html|title=Don’t buy the trade deal alarmism|last=Board|first=Editorial|date=11 March 2015|access-date=1 August 2016|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[International Bar Association|International Bar Association (IBA)]], states have won a higher percentage of ISDS cases than investors, and that around one-third of all cases end in settlement.&lt;ref name=":273"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibanet.org/Document/Default.aspx?DocumentUid=f30e1893-08fb-4c8e-93bd-eac8442faf5e|title=Investor-state dispute settlement: the importance of an informed, fact-based debate|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=International Bar Association|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claimant investors, when successful, recover on average less than half of what the amounts claimed.&lt;ref name=":273" /&gt; IBA notes that "only 8 per cent of ISDS proceedings are commenced by very large multinational corporations."&lt;ref name=":273" /&gt; IBA challenges the notion that ISDS is biased against developing countries, noting that there is "no correlation between the success rates of claims against states and their income levels or development status."&lt;ref name=":273" /&gt; IBA notes that ISDS is necessary even in countries with sophisticated domestic legal systems because those domestic courts rule according to domestic laws, not international law.&lt;ref name=":273" /&gt; IBA notes that "increasingly, awards require the losing party to pay arbitration costs and legal fees to the winning party", which deters investors from initiating unmeritorious cases.&lt;ref name=":273" /&gt;

A 2017 study found that the success rates of investors in investor-state disputes has sharply fallen over time because most legal challenges today seek compensation for regulation implemented by democracies, not expropriation by non-democracies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pelc|first=Krzysztof J.|date=31 May 2017|title=What Explains the Low Success Rate of Investor-State Disputes?|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/what-explains-the-low-success-rate-of-investorstate-disputes/7AE6CEA67B5A0FADAE3B11703C4A1442|journal=International Organization|pages=1–25|doi=10.1017/S0020818317000212|issn=0020-8183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the study argues that the likely goal of investors is not to obtain compensation through ISDS, but to impose costs on governments contemplating regulations and therefore deter the regulatory ambitions of governments.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Transparency ===
Opponents of ISDS argue that arbitrations are sometimes carried out in secret by trade lawyers who do not enjoy the typical safeguards of judicial independence and procedural fairness, who earn income only if a case is brought and proceeds, and who are not accountable to the public or required to take into account broader constitutional and international law human rights norms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://justinvestment.org/2011/05/oecd-document-discusses-investor-state-dispute-settlement/ Van Harten, Gus. "OECD Document Discusses Investor State Dispute Settlement".] Accessed: 7 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] agrees "that secrecy has gone too far" in many ISDS cases, but notes that agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership did ensure greater transparency in ISDS.&lt;ref name=":232" /&gt; Proponents of ISDS point out that confidentiality is a standard feature of all [[arbitration]] and one that enables a constructive, de-politicized and fact-oriented atmosphere of dispute resolution. On the other hand, such traditional confidentiality is limited to disputes that affect the parties in question and not the broader public. Also, most ICSID awards, although confidential, are de facto published by consent of the parties. However, many awards under other arbitration rules are not public and, in the case of investor-arbitration at the International Chamber of Commerce, there is a requirement for blanket confidentiality for all aspects of a case.

It is further pointed out that judges are not elected in most countries outside the US, so that "public accountability of judges" may not be considered a standard of [[public international law]]. In any event, they say, the qualification of ISDS arbitrators matches or exceeds the qualification of most court judges.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In response, critics make the point that any judge, whether domestic or international, who is part of a legal system not shown to be systematically biased or unreliable, has a greater claim to independence than an arbitrator because they are insulated from conflicts of interest that arise when arbitrators work on the side as lawyers, and is assigned cases in an objective manner rather than by the discretion of a disputing party or an executive official. Arbitrators are appointed by both parties at dispute, so such conflicts of interest may arise on both sides.

While ISDS has traditionally been confidential as any other [[arbitration]], the general trend in the last decade has been to allow for more openness and transparency. On the other hand, there is still widespread confidentiality in the system.

Under Art. 29 of the U.S. Model-BIT of 2004, all documents pertaining to ISDS have to be made public and [[amicus curiae]] briefs are allowed. However, no investment treaty allows other parties who have an interest in the dispute, other than the claimant investor and respondent government, to obtain [[standing (law)|standing]] in the adjudicative process.

Under the [[Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership]], the tribunals shall, subject to the consent of the disputing parties, conduct hearings open to the public. The tribunal will make available to the public documents relating to the dispute such as the notice of intent, the notice of arbitration, pleadings, memorials, minutes or transcripts of the hearings of the tribunal, where available; orders, awards and decisions of the tribunal. In addition, third parties can and increasingly do participate in investor-state arbitration by submitting ''[[amicus curiae]]'' petitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/StaticFiles/basicdoc/partF-chap04.htm#r37 |title=ICSID, Arbitration Rules |publisher=Icsid.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]]'s [[International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID) is required by ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 22 to make public, information on the registration of all requests for arbitration and to indicate in due course the date and method of the termination of each proceeding. It also publishes the vast majority of awards with the consent of the parties. If the parties do not consent, ICSID publishes excerpts showing the tribunal's reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&amp;actionVal=ShowHome&amp;pageName=Cases_Home |title=International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, ICSID Cases |publisher=Icsid.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICSID website has published awards for most completed arbitrations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&amp;reqFrom=Main&amp;actionVal=OnlineAward |title=International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, View Decisions and Awards |publisher=Icsid.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and decisions in investor-state arbitrations outside of ICSID are also publicly available online.

On 1 April 2014, the [[UNCITRAL]] Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration entered into force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/arbitration/rules-on-transparency/Rules-on-Transparency-E.pdf|format=PDF|title=UNCITRAL : Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration|publisher=Uncitral.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 3 foresees a general duty to publish all documents pertaining to an ISDS-procedure under UNCITRAL Rules, where the treaty establishing the ISDS-mechanism has been concluded after 1 April 2014 or where the parties so consent, subject to certain overwhelming confidentiality interests listed in Article 7. Original proposals to make all UNCITRAL arbitration under investment treaties public were not adopted after opposition by some states and by representatives of the arbitration industry who participated in the UNCITRAL working group negotiations as state representatives.

On 17 March 2015, the United Nations Convention on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration ('Mauritius Convention') was opened for signatures in Port Louis, Mauritius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/2014Transparency_Convention.html|title=2014 - UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration|work=uncitral.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mauritius Convention will render the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor State Arbitration also applicable to disputes arising out of investment treaties that were concluded prior to 1 April 2014 if both parties to the investment treaty are also party to the Mauritius Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Article 3, Mauritius Convention http://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/arbitration/transparency-convention/Transparency-Convention-e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention has not yet entered into force since the three required ratifications have not yet been submitted.&lt;ref name="uncitral.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/2014Transparency_Convention_status.html|title=Status|work=uncitral.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 10 States have signed the Mauritius Convention so far.&lt;ref name="uncitral.org"/&gt;

== Tribunals ==
Investment disputes can be initiated by corporations and natural persons and in almost all cases, investment tribunals are composed of three arbitrators (unless otherwise agreed by the parties). As in most [[arbitration]]s, one is appointed by the investor, one by the state, and the third is usually chosen by agreement between the parties or their appointed arbitrators or selected by the appointing authority, depending on the procedural rules applicable to the dispute. If the parties do not agree who to appoint, this power is assigned to executive officials usually at the World Bank, the International Bureau of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, or a private chamber of commerce.

Other individuals cannot initiate a claim against a state under an investment treaty. Also, no individual or state can initiate a claim against a foreign investor under an investment treaty. This has led to criticisms that investor-state arbitration is not balanced and that it favours the "haves" over the "have nots" by giving foreign investors, especially major companies, access to a special tribunal outside any court. While the arbitration process itself does not provide explicitly privileged access for larger investors over individuals or SMEs, the costs of ISDS, as in any court or arbitration system, tend to be off-putting for smaller claimants.

== Examples ==
According to a May 2011 working paper, "In terms of wins and losses, [the] U.S. has never lost a case as the respondent country. U.S. investors have won 15 cases, lost 22 cases and settled 14 cases. In terms of performance with respect to developing countries, U.S. investors have won 14 cases and lost 17."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/179093/2/11-01TreatyArbitrationReappraisal.pdf|title=Working Paper No. 11-01: Investment Treaty Arbitration and Developing Countries: A Re-Appraisal|authors=Kevin P.

=== Cases won by government ===

; ''Apotex v. the United States''

: Under Chapter 11 of NAFTA, [[Apotex Inc.]], a Canadian pharmaceuticals corporation, has alleged that U.S. courts committed errors in interpreting federal law, and that such errors were in violation of NAFTA Article 1102 (national treatment) and Article 1105 (minimum standard of treatment under international law). [[Apotex]] also alleged that the challenged U.S. court decision in favor of the [[Pfizer]] drug company expropriated Apotex’s investments in generic versions of the antidepressant [[Zoloft]] under NAFTA Article 1110 as was manifestly unjust.&lt;ref name=apotex&gt;[https://www.state.gov/s/l/c27648.htm "Apotex Inc v USA", US Department of State.] Accessed: 12 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

: Apotex relied on the doctrine that a manifestly unjust domestic legal decision breaches international law and can be viewed as a substantive denial of justice.&lt;ref&gt;McFadden, M. 1995. "Provincialism in US Courts", ''[[Cornell Law Review]]'' 81:31 at 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Apotex has also brought a similar claim involving U.S. regulatory provisions concerning an abbreviated new drug development application for [[Pravastatin]] and patents allegedly held by [[Bristol Myers Squibb]].&lt;ref name=apotex /&gt; Apotex has two claims involving different generic products.

; ''Chemtura Corporation v. Canada''

: [[Chemtura Corporation]], a United States agricultural [[pesticide]] products manufacturer, alleged that the Canadian government's [[Pest Management Regulatory Agency]] (PMRA) wrongfully terminated its pesticide business in [[lindane]]-based products, which are used on [[canola]], [[rapeseed]], [[mustard seed]] and cole crops to control [[flea beetle]] infestations, and on cereal crops to control [[wireworm]]. Chemtura alleged NAFTA violations of Article 1105 (on minimum standards of treatment) and Article 1110 (on expropriation). All claims were dismissed by the Tribunal, given that the measure did not amount to a substantial deprivation of the Claimant's investment and was taken legitimately and without bad faith.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/s/l/c29737.htm "Chemtura Corp. v. Government of Canada", US Department of State.] Accessed: 12 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

; ''Philip Morris v. Uruguay''

: The [[Philip Morris v. Uruguay]] case (Spanish: [[:es:Caso Philip Morris contra Uruguay]]) started on 19 February 2010, when the multinational tobacco company Philip Morris International filed a complaint against Uruguay seeking $25 million in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Alfred-Maurice de Zayas]]|title=How can Philip Morris sue Uruguay over its tobacco laws?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/16/philip-morris-uruguay-tobacco-isds-human-rights|website=The Guardian|accessdate=22 October 2016|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company complained that Uruguay's anti-smoking legislation devalued its cigarette trademarks and investments in the country and based its lawsuit on the bilateral investment treaty between Switzerland and Uruguay.

=== Dismissed cases ===

; ''KT Asia Investment Group v. Kazakhstan''

: The claimant (company incorporated in Holland) was a shell company owned by Kazakh national (Mr. Ablyazov). It owned shares in BTA Bank, which the claimant alleged were nationalized by the respondent (Kazakhstan). The state position was that as owned by a Kazakh national the claimant was not eligible for investment protection under the Dutch-Kazakh BIT. This argument was dismissed by the Arbitrage. The Kazakh state than alleged that it didn’t nationalize the bank, but it bailed it out (wiping out the shares’ value in the process). The latter was due to the embezzlement of depositors’ trust (and funds) by Mr. Ablyazov. Investigating the matter the Arbitrage reached the conclusion that the investment doesn’t meet the Salini test, thus it is not protected under the BIT. As a result the Arbitrage decided it has no jurisdiction to decide the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;ICSID Case No. ARB/09/8 http://icsidfiles.worldbank.org/icsid/ICSIDBLOBS/OnlineAwards/C620/DC3912_En.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prospects for ISDS ==
After ISDS claims by investors sharply increased starting in the late 1990s, ISDS came under greater public attention and criticism. This was true for the NAFTA claims against the United States in the late 1990s, for Germany in the wake of the [[Vattenfall]] claims in the late 2000s and also for Australia in 2011, when confronted with the Philip Morris claim.&lt;ref name=economist-20141011&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21623756-governments-are-souring-treaties-protect-foreign-investors-arbitration |title=Investor-state dispute settlement - The arbitration game |newspaper=The Economist |date=11 October 2014 |accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Australian government announced that it would discontinue the practice of seeking inclusion of investor state dispute settlement provisions in trade agreements with developing countries. It stated that it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...supports the principle of national treatment — that foreign and domestic businesses are treated equally under the law. However, the Government does not support provisions that would confer greater legal rights on foreign businesses than those available to domestic businesses. Nor will the Government support provisions that would constrain the ability of Australian governments to make laws on social, environmental and economic matters in circumstances where those laws do not discriminate between domestic and foreign businesses. The Government has not and will not accept provisions that limit its capacity to put health warnings or plain packaging requirements on tobacco products or its ability to continue the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme... In the past, Australian Governments have sought the inclusion of investor-state dispute resolution procedures in trade agreements with developing countries at the behest of Australian businesses. The Gillard Government will discontinue this practice. If Australian businesses are concerned about sovereign risk in Australian trading partner countries, they will need to make their own assessments about whether they want to commit to investing in those countries... Foreign businesses investing in Australia will be entitled to the same legal protections as domestic businesses but the Gillard Government will not confer greater rights on foreign businesses through investor-state dispute resolution provisions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acci.asn.au/getattachment/b9d3cfae-fc0c-4c2a-a3df-3f58228daf6d/Gillard-Government-Trade-Policy-Statement.aspx "Trade Policy Statement", Australian Government.] Accessed: 5 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This statement is a reaction to Philip Morris' ISDS claim under [[UNCITRAL]] rules to challenge Australian tobacco Advertising Restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ag.gov.au/internationalrelations/internationallaw/pages/tobaccoplainpackaging.aspx|title=Tobacco plain packaging—investor-state arbitration|publisher=Ag.gov.au|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013,{{Update inline|date=April 2017}} Australia had not terminated any bilateral investment treaties allowing for ISDS. Even if it were to do so, most such treaties foresee post-termination-protection for many years after the termination has become effective. In any event, since the election of the conservative Coalition Government in 2013, the Government has entered into free trade agreements (such as the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, Ch 9 section B) that include ISDS.&lt;ref&gt;http://dfat.gov.au/trade/agreements/chafta/Pages/australia-china-fta.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative way ahead may be the preservation of investor protection under [[public international law]], including ISDS, but with more concern for transparency and the balancing of economic and non-economic interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2014/130710/LDM_BRI(2014)130710_REV2_EN.pdf|format=PDF|title=Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) : State of play and prospects for reform|publisher=Europarl.europa.eu|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted [[#Debates|above]], the [[European Commission]] proposed September 2015) an 'Investment Court System' to replace ISDS clauses (notably in the draft TTIP), with the scope for investor challenge much reduced and with 'highly skilled judges' rather than arbitrators used to determine cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Commission proposes new Investment Court System for TTIP and other EU trade and investment negotiations | url = http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5651_en.htm | work = The European Commission| date = 16 September 2015 | accessdate = 25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this vein, [[Karel De Gucht]], the [[European Commissioner for Trade|EU commissioner]] in charge of negotiating [[International Investment Agreement]]s declared on 18 December 2014 that future agreements shall become more transparent, shall "fully enshrine democratic prerogatives" and "explicitly state that legitimate government public policy decisions – on issues such as the balance between public and private provision of healthcare or "the European ban on chicken carcasses washed with chlorine" – cannot be over-ridden".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/18/wrong-george-monbiot-nothing-secret-eu-trade-deal|title=You're wrong, George Monbiot – there is nothing secret about this EU trade deal|author=Karel De Gucht|work=the Guardian|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced to "crack down on companies using legal technicalities to build frivolous cases against governments", to "open up investment tribunals to public scrutiny – documents will be public and interested parties, including NGOs, will be able to make submissions". Also, he said, the EU "will eliminate any conflicts of interest – the arbitrators who decide on EU cases must be above suspicion". However, insisting equally on the advantages of such investment protection agreements, he states along that [they] "protect job-creating investment from discrimination and unfair treatment" and that "the task here is to find the right balance between preventing abuse and protecting investments".

Current controversies over ISDS appear driven by attempts to expand its scope to new countries and, especially, to relations between developed countries with mature court systems and democratic governments.

In 2014, several members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] expressed opposition to inclusion of ISDS in the proposed [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership]] (TTIP) between the United States and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Drake | first = Celeste | title = Powerful Members of Congress Oppose Special 'Corporate Court' Rights for European Firms | publisher = [[AFL–CIO]] | date = 18 December 2014 | url = http://www.aflcio.org/Blog/Political-Action-Legislation/Powerful-Members-of-Congress-Oppose-Special-Corporate-Court-Rights-for-European-Firms | accessdate = 2014-12-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20141221072048/http://www.aflcio.org/Blog/Political-Action-Legislation/Powerful-Members-of-Congress-Oppose-Special-Corporate-Court-Rights-for-European-Firms | archivedate = 21 December 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, faced with opposition to ISDS in several European countries, the European Parliament adopted a resolution requiring any new dispute settlement scheme included in TTIP "must be replaced by a new public and transparent system of investment protection, in which private interests cannot undermine public policy and which is subject to public law".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Euractiv: European Parliament backs TTIP, rejects ISDS|url = http://www.euractiv.com/sections/global-europe/european-parliament-backs-ttip-rejects-isds-316142|accessdate = 2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The Commission's 2015 proposal in response is noted [[#Debates|above]]).

South Africa has stated it will withdraw from treaties with ISDS clauses, and India is also considering such a position. Indonesia plans to let treaties with ISDS clauses lapse when they need renewal. Brazil has refused any treaty with ISDS clauses.&lt;ref name="economist-20141011" /&gt;

In 2018, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that "The arbitration clause in the Agreement between the Netherlands and Slovakia on the protection of investments is not compatible with EU law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2018-03/cp180026en.pdf|title=Judgment in Case C-284/16 - Slowakische Republik v Achmea BV|author=Court of Justice of the European Union|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling could imply that any similar arbitration tribunal considering corporate sovereignty cases would also be illegal under EU law.

'''Josue Carrion''' (born {{circa|1978}}) is a Puerto Rican businessman. He was also the show host of the television show, ''[[El Tiempo Es Oro (television show)|El Tiempo Es Oro]]''. On December 19, 2014, that show was cancelled by Puerto Rican television channel, [[WAPA America]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.primerahora.com/entretenimiento/tv/nota/mrcashyeltiempoesorosedespidendewapacontremendafiesta-1054542/&lt;/ref&gt;On [[November 16]], 2015, Carrion returned to television in the United States and Puerto Rico, as host of [[Mega-TV]]'s show, "[[Sales de Oro]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elnuevodia.com/entretenimiento/tv/nota/salesdeoroconjosuecarrioncumplesucometido-2127559/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Manny Mashouf''' (born 6 July 1938) is an [[Iranian-American]] businessman and philanthropist known for founding [[Bebe Stores]].

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Iran]] in 1938, he came to the [[United States]] in his teens and settled first in [[Washington D.C.]], then in [[San Francisco]]. There, he went to [[San Francisco State University]] and graduated with a [[political science]] degree. He first managed a steakhouse, before founding his own fashion line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manny Mashouf |url=http://iranians.kodoom.com/en/manny-mashouf/ |publisher=iranians.kodoom.com/en |accessdate=22 November 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123054943/http://iranians.kodoom.com/en/manny-mashouf/ |archivedate=23 November 2016 |df= }}{{dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He was the manager and chairman of [[Bebe stores]]. In 1998, he took the company public.&lt;ref name=former-richest&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |year=2006 |title=#242 Manny Mashouf &amp; family |publisher=''[[Forbes]]'' |publication-place= |page= |url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/54/biz_06rich400_Manny-Mashouf-family_CFHU.html |accessdate=April 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Mashouf was worth US$1.5 billion - resulting in Forbes listing him as the 242nd richest American.&lt;ref name=former-richest/&gt; By 2007 that has dropped to  $1.3 Billion.&lt;ref name="networth"&gt;{{cite web| title = The World's Billionaires #754 Manny Mashouf &amp; family| publisher = [[Forbes]]| date = 2007-08-03| url = https://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/10/07billionaires_Manny-Mashouf-family_CFHU.html| accessdate = 2007-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partnered with Giovanni Agnelli and Manny Mashouf, [[Scott Bloom]] founded the production company [[Argonaut Pictures]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117991716.html?categoryid%3D3235%26cs%3D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915070423/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117991716.html?categoryid=3235&amp;cs=1 |archivedate=2008-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced in 2015 that he was to sell his 59% stake in Bebe.&lt;ref name=sell-stake&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |year=2015 |title=Bebe Founder Manny Mashouf Sells 59 Percent Stake |publisher=ubmfashion.com |publication-place= |page= |url=http://www.ubmfashion.com/blogs/bebe-founder-manny-mashouf-sell-59-stake |accessdate= }}{{dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of Bebe's stores are scheduled to close and liquidate inventory by the end of May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-21/bebe-said-to-plan-to-shut-its-stores-in-brick-and-mortar-retreat |title=Bebe Plans to Shut Its Stores and Focus on Web Sales |date=21 March 2017 |website=bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
In 2005 Mashouf pledged $10 million to his [[alma mater]], San Francisco State for a performing arts center.&lt;ref name=philantrhopy-nedia/&gt; The donation was later redirected to the construction of the Mashouf Wellness Center.&lt;ref name=sf-examiner&gt;{{cite news |last=Barba |first=Michael  |date= April 22, 2017 |title=Founder of Closing Bebe Stores had Philanthropic Ties to State |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/founder-closing-bebe-stores-philanthropic-ties-sf-state/  | work=[[San Francisco Examiner]] |location= |access-date=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''master contract''' or '''master agreement''' is a [[collective bargaining]] agreement which covers all [[trade union|unionized]] worksites in an industry, market or company, and which establishes the terms and conditions of employment common to all workers in the industry, market or company.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;Najita, Joyce, and Roberts, Harold S.

New York Shipping Association-International Longshoremen's Association Pension Trust Fund,'' [[case citation|880 F.2d 1531]] (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

==About master contracts==
A master contract may be geographically limited and occur at the local, regional or national level. It may also be limited to a specific market, whether local, regional or national.&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, Patrick; Higgins, Jr, John E.; Hexter, Christopher T.; and Neighbours, John T. ''The Developing Labor Law: The Board, the Courts, and the National Labor Relations Act.'' 4th ed. Washington, D.C.: BNA Books, 2002. {{ISBN|1-57018-151-9}}; Williams, Steve and Adam-Smith, Derek. ''Contemporary Employment Relations: A Critical Introduction.'' Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-19-927243-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a master contract governs the general terms of employment that apply uniformly across the company or industry, master contracts often provide for local terms to be negotiated.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Some master contracts may also permit local or regional variations in order to meet special economic, competitive, or other circumstances for a union or company.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; For example, in the early 1980s the [[United Auto Workers]] exempted [[Chrysler]] from the master contract governing the U.S. auto industry because the company was in deep financial trouble.&lt;ref name="Levin"&gt;Levin, Doron P. "Chrysler Makes Plea To U.A.W." ''New York Times.'' July 21, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Master contracts are common in the automobile manufacturing, shipping, package express, mining (especially coal mining), and general manufacturing industries. For example, the UAW and the [[Big Three automobile manufacturers|"Big Three" American automakers]] tend to operate in this pattern: the union selects one manufacturer with which it does most of its negotiation; when an agreement is reached, the union attempts to apply the same contract to the others.&lt;ref name="LaborEducation" /&gt; Other areas where master agreements can be found include tire manufacturing,&lt;ref&gt;Brus, Brian. "Bridgestone/Firestone, Union Negotiators Reach Master Contract." ''Oklahoma City Journal Record.'' June 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; public education,&lt;ref&gt;Todd, Kris.

In some cases, the goal of a master agreement is to standardize pay and benefit conditions in a market or industry so that employers compete on the grounds of quality services, quality products, or improved [[Occupational safety and health|workplace safety]].&lt;ref&gt;Brisbin Jr., Richard A. ''A Strike Like No Other Strike: Law and Resistance During the Pittston Coal Strike of 1989-1990.'' Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-8018-6901-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Royle"&gt;Royle, Tony and Towers, Brian. ''Labour Relations in the Global Fast-food Industry.'' New York: Routledge, 2002. {{ISBN|0-415-22167-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Master contracts also make it easier for newly organized workers, who get rolled into existing contract rather than having to negotiate their own first contract (with the risk that negotiations may drag on or collapse, causing the new union to eventually collapse).&lt;ref name="Royle" /&gt;

[[Closed shop|Traditionally]], such contracts have been struck as exclusive class actions between the whole class of workers and the whole class of (or a single) employer(s), excluding the employment of any workers outside of it. In the [[Right to work state|United States]] in particular there has been pressure from the employing class generally on this.

==Strategy==
When negotiating a master contract, the union often selects the financially strongest employer or worksite to negotiate with it. This agreement becomes the master contract, and [[pattern bargaining|sets the pattern]] for bargaining with the other employers or worksites.&lt;ref name="Levin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"USWA Names Goodyear Target for Master Contract Talks." ''Rubber &amp; Plastics News.'' April 14, 2003; Freeman, Sholnn. "Union Picks GM to Lead Contract Talks." ''Washington Post.'' September 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Master contracts can also be used strategically for other ends such as organizing and to break down employer resistance to collective bargaining. In Canada, unions have used master contracts to organize thousands of new workers. A master agreement has tended to weaken an employer's resistance to the spread of the union to unorganized worksites or divisions, and some industries and markets welcome the standardization of pay and fringe benefits that unionization brings.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, Charlotte. "Expanding Labour's Horizons: Union Organizing and Strategic Change in Canada." ''Just Labour.'' 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, some unions have sought to create master agreements which provide for a neutrality agreement, code of conduct for the organizing election, or neutral third-party oversight of an election in order to make union organizing easier.&lt;ref name="Kutalik"&gt;[http://www.labornotes.org/node/1054 Kutalik, Chris. "Two Unions Enter Recognition Pact with Health Care Company." ''Labor Notes. July 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some master agreements even state that new workers will automatically come under the master agreement.&lt;ref name="Kutalik" /&gt; Master bargaining also reduces the likelihood that employers will refuse to bargain or seek to whittle away at unionization workplace by workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbrother, Peter and Yates, Charlotte. ''Trade Unions in Renewal: A Comparative Study.'' New York: Routledge, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8264-5437-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Some union members criticize master contracts for submerging local differences, and for being undemocratic.&lt;ref&gt;The claim is that by permitting thousands or even tens of thousands of members to vote on a contract, the master contract makes it impossible for the contract's opponents to muster enough votes across all workplaces to defeat the contract.  For an example, see: [http://www.uniondemocracy.com/UDR/66-ILA%20dockers%20against%20contract.htm Biers, Carl and Niemeijer, Marsha. "Dockworkers Campaign Against ILA Master Agreement." ''Union Democracy Review.'' June–July 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics point to master contracts which impose certain fundamental terms and conditions of employment (such as wages, fringe benefits, pensions and certain working conditions) as being nothing more than [[company union]]ism.&lt;ref name="Kutalik" /&gt; In the United States, unions have engaged in bitter battles over such master agreements in California and Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://labornotes.org/taxonomy/term/55?from=15 Gaus, Mischa. "Quiet Deal Leads to Bitter Fight in Ohio Hospitals." ''Labor Notes.'' April 2008]; [http://labornotes.org/node/1556 Brenner, Mark. "Health Care Local Charges SEIU Is Shutting Members Out of Bargaining &amp; Organizing." ''Labor Notes.'' March 2008]; White, Ronald D. "Unions Battle for Nurses." ''Los Angeles Times.'' August 3, 2003; Lando, Tamar. "Union Triage." ''L.A. Weekly.'' September 25, 2003; Kaplan, Esther. "Labor's Growing Pains." ''The Nation.'' June 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], master contracts proved so contentious that they were essentially outlawed under the 1996 [[WorkChoices]] legislation and its 2005 amendments.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Jill. "Work Choices and the Radical Revision of the Public Realm of Australian Statutory Labour Law." ''Industrial Law Journal.'' December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Newport Center''' is a business, shopping, and entertainment district located on a high bluff overlooking Newport Harbor in [[Newport Beach, California]]. Newport Center is also famously dubbed "[[Fashion Island]]" amongst locals. It was created in the early 1960s as part of [[William Pereira]]'s master plan for the [[Irvine Ranch]]. Newport Center was created as the unofficial "downtown" of the Irvine Ranch, which at the time extended all the way down to [[Pacific Coast Highway (US)|Pacific Coast Highway]].

==History==
[[Image:NewportCenter-satellite.jpg|left|thumb|Satellite view of Newport Center, taken in 2005]]
It was the site used for the [[1953 National Scout Jamboree]] of the [[Boy Scouts of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcninteractive.com/nb100/story_boyscouts.htm Newport Beach 100 – Landmarks and Legends] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928121306/http://www.tcninteractive.com/nb100/story_boyscouts.htm |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was held where Newport Center and [[Fashion Island]] now sit. It was the third international jamboree; the first jamboree held west of the Mississippi River and had with 50,000 scouts from all 48 states, Alaska, Hawaii, and 16 foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocalmanac.com/History/hi01h.htm Orange County – 1946 to 1962]&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the first sites considered for [[Disneyland]]. During excavation of the site for the first buildings, a considerable amount of [[petrified wood]] was discovered, indicating that a small forest once existed in the area.

The center was designed as part of a joint venture between Pereira and [[Welton Becket]], with an emphasis on [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] architecture. The first building, at 400 Newport Center Drive, went up in 1967, with the majority of the center's buildings following in the 1970s. Although Newport Center's International Style design was mostly seen through to completion, Pereira broke his own rule by adding the [[Futurist architecture|futurist]] Pacific Mutual building in 1972, which became one of Newport Beach's most well-known architectural landmarks. Newport Center and Fashion Island were named by Orange County advertising pioneer Leland Oliver Co., Inc. which also created the advertising and public relations for many years.

The strip of land between Avocado and MacArthur roads was originally slated to be an exit spur of the Pacific Coast Freeway, which was never built. It sat largely empty until the late 2000s when a library and park were constructed on the site.

==Economy==
The center occupies a large city block between Jamboree, MacArthur and San Joaquin Hills roads, and [[Pacific Coast Highway (US)|Pacific Coast Highway]]. In the center of this block is a circular road, called Newport Center Drive, with high-rise buildings encircling the outside edge of the road.  Numerous businesses are located along Newport Center Drive, including insurer [[Pacific Life]], [[PIMCO]], [[Janus Capital Group]], [[Acacia Research|Acacia Research Corporation]], [[Irvine Company]], Blackwood, and law firm [[Stradling Yocca Carlson &amp; Rauth]].

==Fashion Island==
[[Image:Fashionislandnewportcenterentrance.jpg|thumb|right|Main entrance to Newport Center and Fashion Island at intersection of Newport Center Drive and Highway 1]]
The center of the circle is occupied by [[Fashion Island]]. Adjacent to the complex is the very upscale [[Big Canyon Country Club]] community.

==Transportation==
Newport Center Drive is accessed from the outside by five roads, which are named after the [[Channel Islands of California]]. These roads split the center into "superblocks", each of which were built and leased as separate properties.

'''One Block Off the Grid''', or '''1BOG''', is a US [[solar energy|solar]] company that works with the largest solar providers in the nation to create a single online destination for solar energy options. Originally, it was formed as an example of a [[social entrepreneurship]] model that promotes [[community development]], [[social activism]] and personal responsibility. 1BOG currently operates in approximately fifteen US cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/company/1bog|title=One Block off the Grid|publisher=Crunchbase}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One Block Off the Grid's name is a metaphor for freeing the world from its dependency on non-renewable power sources, one block at a time.

==Business model==
1BOG has a solution for the pain point the solar industry has experienced up to now in the residential market—large upfront costs make many homeowners reluctant or unable to manage the purchase. One executive told Venturebeat that outside of a few very tiny neighborhoods in San Francisco, the company finds that about 80% of its customers need financing: “It’s that difference between paying about $10,000 and just a thousand up front,” he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/03/31/sunrun-teams-with-virgance-to-finance-solar-for-consumers/#LDjodItG0siv8Gig.99 |title=SunRun teams with Virgance to finance solar for consumers |date=March 31, 2009 |publisher=VentureBeat |author=Chris Morrison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, 1BOG used [[community organizing]] techniques such as house parties, [[canvassing]], and [[Volunteering|volunteer]] recruitment in addition to [[social networking]] and traditional marketing techniques to obtain a critical mass of consumers in a given city who are interested in learning more about solar technology.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/05/magazine/05wwln-consumed-t.html?ref=earth Rob Walker, “Panel Discussion,” The New York Times Magazine, April 3, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

When a homeowner first expressed an interest in solar, 1BOG would evaluate the roof to determine whether the option made sense for the homeowner. If solar was a good option for the particular house and the homeowner's electric bill was more than a certain amount, 1BOG would identified similar solar prospects in the area and group them together, leveraging that bargaining power with solar installers to establish a lower cost. As one customer said:

:We wouldn't have done it otherwise...just that much additional money that I didn't quite have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketplace.org/topics/sustainability/community-solar-power-within-reach |title=Community solar power is within reach |author=Marketplace |publisher=American Public Media |date=June 23, 2009 |accessdate=2012-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently 1BOG has been a leading force in the move to solar leasing, a newer model which applies to solar technology a financing structure similar to an automobile lease. As many as 40% of solar customers now lease rather than purchase their solar equipment outright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mnn.com/money/green-workplace/stories/how-does-solar-leasing-work |title=How does solar leasing work? |author=Amy Feinstein |publisher=Mother Nature Network |date=March 1, 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns==
1BOG’s [[Bay Area]] pilot campaign in 2008 organized 42 [[solar power|solar]] customers. [[Real Goods]] Solar won the bid for that project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sfbay.1bog.org/san-francisco-solar-sep-08/ 1BOG Cities: Past Campaigns]&lt;/ref&gt; The second Bay Area campaign signed up over 1200 members. This time the chosen installer was [[SolarCity]]. "What really sealed it for us was their offer of free demand-side energy monitoring and a free home-energy audit to 1BOG
participants," according to 1BOG general manager Dave Llorens. "The audit shows
people where to find the best bang-for-the-buck on green home improvements,
while the new monitoring technology empowers people to make continued and
measurable improvements to their energy efficiency." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS165284+06-Jan-2009+BW20090106|title=1BOG and SolarCity Announce Bay Area-Wide Residential Solar Program |publisher=Reuters |date=January 6, 2009 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the [[Bay Area]], 1BOG currently has campaigns at various stages in [[Los Angeles]], [[San Diego]], [[New Orleans]], [[Denver]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Sacramento]], [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], [[Aspen]], [[Austin]], [[Bergen County]] ([[New Jersey]]), [[Boston]], [[Brooklyn]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Miami]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and [[Seattle]]. 1BOG is currently working with a variety of solar providers, and plans to branch out into [[solar thermal]] installations and home [[energy conservation]].

==1BOG Logo – a.k.a. "Plugfoot"==
The 1BOG logo, often referred to as “the Bogman”, is the result of a crowdsourcing branding effort led by Sylvia Ventura in April 2008. The logo challenge resulted in over 150 submissions. The Bogman was the finalist.

==Key people==
1BOG was founded in 2008 by [[Dave Llorens]] (CEO), Sylvia Ventura, and Dan Barahona. In 2012, 1BOG was acquired by Pure Energies Group.

==History==
In early 2007, Ventura and Barahona spent three months researching solar power for their San Francisco home. They became expert in solar technologies, electric utility rates and metering, and local and federal tax incentives and rebates and found that many people were interested in residential solar technology, but few knew anything about it, nor where it was feasible. So Ventura and Barahona created advocacy and outreach website Solar4SF.org&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Solar4SF.org - Solar Energy Advocacy for San Francisco and the Bay Area |accessdate=2013-10-17 |date=2007-10-09 |url=http://www.solar4sf.org/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009083659/http://www.solar4sf.org/ |archivedate=October 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to share their research and promote solar with for easy-to-understand information and evaluation criteria for [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] residents.

In March 2008 Barahona and Ventura imagined an entire city block in which every residence would go solar. The collective buying power of this relatively larger group of solar consumers would allow them to negotiate better pricing from installers. The goal of taking one city block off the grid led to their new venture’s name, One Block Off the Grid, soon shortened to the acronym '''1BOG'''.

The difficulty of convincing every single homeowner in a city block to commit to a major purchase however made Ventura and Barahona focus on aggregates of a ‘virtual city block’ representing about 200 [[Kilowatt#Kilowatt|kilowatts]]. They met Llorens, a solar consultant and the co-founder of SolarPowerRocks.com,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.SolarPowerRocks.com Here's how you get the most from solarpowerrocks.com: | Solar Power Rocks&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; a site that provides solar information for all fifty states. The three agreed to build 1BOG together.

1BOG officially launched on June 5, 2008, the day after San Francisco enacted the largest solar incentive in the city’s history. It was followed by numerous grassroot and social media efforts to educate and recruit San Francisco residents. Within one month 200 people had signed up on 1BOG’s website to receive an evaluation. The San Francisco pilot helped convert 42 homes to solar energy by negotiating a 48% reduction from list price, and generated over $800,000 in local solar installation sales.

The San Francisco Chronicle&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/10/10/HOMS12TISR.DTL "Shining a light on S.F. solar options," San Francisco Chronicle, October 11, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; documented the success of the campaign in an in-depth article on October 11, 2008. The press coverage drove another 400 new 1BOG members within two days and helped propel 1BOG forward on future campaigns. Over the following months 1BOG was featured prominently in [[Huffington Post]], [[CNET]], [[New York Times]], [[TIME]], [[Wall Street Journal]], [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]], [[TreeHugger]], and others.

By the end of October 1BOG had seeded campaigns in seven additional cities including New York, Seattle, Portland, Colorado, and San Jose and Oakland in the Bay Area. The company was acquired in November 2008 by [[San Francisco]]-based [[Virgance]], a company that promotes large-scale [[social activism]] through [[market-based]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= "Change We Can Profit From," The Economist, January 29, 2009|url=http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13031214|work=|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gp2hfTcZ|archivedate=2009-05-16|deadurl=no|accessdate=2009-05-13|date=January 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 1BOG formed an alliance with [[SunRun]] to offer [[financing]] options aimed at lowering the upfront costs traditionally associated with [[solar power|solar]] installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Chris Morrison, "SunRun teams with Virgance to finance solar for consumers," VentureBeat, March 31, 2009.|url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/03/31/sunrun-teams-with-virgance-to-finance-solar-for-consumers/|deadurl=no|accessdate=2012-12-26|date=2009-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was acquired in 2010 by [[Virgance]], a for-profit Web 2.0 company with plans to use social media to make activism interesting and fun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/company/virgance|title=Virgance|publisher=Crunchbase}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remained however more active and widely known than its parent company.

It was bought in 2012 by Pure Energies Group, a closely held [[Toronto]]-based [[solar panel]] manufacturer that credited its ability to make the purchase to [[Ontario]]'s 2009 [[Green Energy Act 2009|Green Energy Act]]. Pure Energies vice president Chris Stern would not give a price for the acquisition but said he expected the new enterprise to be making $50 million by the end of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/article/1244070--green-energy-act-powers-ontario-firm |title=Green Energy Act powers Ontario firm |publisher=thestar.com |date=August 20, 2012 |author=John Spears |accessdate=2012-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Personal Property Securities Register''' ('''PPSR''') is an electronic register that allows security interests in personal property to be registered and searched in accordance with the New Zealand Personal Property Securities Act 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1999/0126/latest/DLM45900.html?search=ts_act_personal+property_resel&amp;p=1&amp;sr=1|title=Personal Property Securities Act 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the Act) and the Australian Personal Property Securities Act 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/ActCompilation1.nsf/0/05083AE887C340DACA257761007AD73B?OpenDocument|title=Personal Property Securities Act 2009|publisher=comlaw.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The New Zealand PPSR is maintained by the [[New Zealand Companies Office]], an agency of the [[Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment]].
The [[Australian Financial Security Authority]] (AFSA) is the Australian Government agency responsible for administering the Australian PPS Register.

==Electronic register==
The New Zealand PPSR is a wholly electronic register available to the public 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  It provides online searching, registration and maintenance of [[financing statement]]s. The Australian PPS Register commenced operation on 30 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://transact.ppsr.gov.au/ppsr/Home|title=Access the Australian PPS Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Act reformed the law relating to security interests in personal property and established the PPSR.  The PPSR became operational on 1 May 2002.  It replaced a number of existing registers including the Chattels Register, Motor Vehicle Securities Register and the Register of Company Charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppsr.govt.nz/cms/about-us|title=About the New Zealand PPSR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, the Australian Personal Property Securities Act 2009 ("the PPS Act") was passed.  The Australian PPS Act establishes the Personal Property Securities Register ("the PPS Register").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppsr.gov.au/ABOUTTHEREGISTER|title=About the Australian PPSR}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Australian PPSR became operational on the 30th of January, 2012.  It replaced a number of existing registers including the Australian Shipping Register, New South Wales Register of Encumbered Vehicles, Queensland Register of Encumbered Vehicles, South Australian Vehicle Securities Register, Tasmanian Motor Vehicle Securities Register, Vic Roads Vehicle Securities Register, and Western Australian Register of Encumbered Vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ppsr.gov.au/previous-securities-registers-and-migrated-data|title=Previous securities registers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The PPSR is used by both secured parties (creditors) and consumers.

=== Registration ===
Registering a security interest on the PPSR may give creditors a better chance of recovering a debt if a debtor defaults.

The Act contains rules for determining priority between security interests in the same collateral (see section 66 of the Act). If a creditor does not register a security interest and a debtor is adjudicated bankrupt or is placed into liquidation, secured creditors will be prioritised when payments are made or assets distributed.

=== Searching ===
The PPSR can be used to assess the level of risk that a debtor may represent to a creditor. Before entering into a contractual relationship with a debtor, a creditor may search the PPSR to check whether they may pose a risk.

It possible for potential creditors to:

* Search a debtor to determine whether there are any existing security interests over their collateral, this may mean they have a number of existing debts.
* Search a debtor to identify if the piece of collateral they are offering you as security has been used as security for another party and if so, someone else will have priority over this collateral.
* Search collateral on the PPSR before buying an item. Check to see if the item is encumbered with an existing registered security. If you are purchasing a car, you may search on the registration number or VIN. Alternatively, conduct a debtor search (against the seller of the goods).

Consumers may also search the PPSR before buying an item of personal property to check that there is no money owing. This is particularly important if purchasing a second hand car privately – it is possible to search the PPSR using the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) to check whether there may be money owed (registered security interests) on the vehicle. The PPSR also correlates information from the [[NEVDIS]] (National Exchange of Vehicle and Driver Information System) database&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austroads.com.au/drivers-vehicles/nevdis National Exchange of Vehicle and Driver Information System (NEVDIS)], [[Austroads]]&lt;/ref&gt; to provide write-off history and stolen vehicle data in the form of a PPSR certificate, which can be issued upon successful completion of a serial number (VIN) search.

==The New Zealand Companies Office==
As well as the PPSR, the [[New Zealand Companies Office]] is also responsible for the administration of the following registers:
* The New Zealand companies register and the Overseas companies register.  These are electronic registers that provide the online searching, incorporation and maintenance services for New Zealand registered companies and overseas companies registered to carry on business in New Zealand.
*The Incorporated Societies Register (including charitable trusts).
*The Motor Vehicle Traders Register (MVTR) – an electronic register that contains information on all registered motor vehicle traders, and information about the trader's business, including its physical address.

=== International activities and involvement ===
The New Zealand Companies Office is a founding member of the [[Corporate Registers Forum]] (an international association of corporate registries) and is an International member of the [[International Association of Commercial Administrators]] (IACA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3865">'''Process architecture''' is the structural design of general process systems. It applies to fields such as computers (software, hardware, networks, etc.), business processes ([[enterprise architecture]], policy and procedures, logistics, project management, etc.), and any other process system of varying degrees of [[complexity]].&lt;ref name=parch&gt;Dawis, E. P., J. F. Dawis, Wei-Pin Koo (2001).  Architecture of Computer-based Systems using Dualistic Petri Nets.  Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, 2001 IEEE International Conference on Volume 3, 2001 Page(s):1554 - 1558 vol.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Processes are defined as having inputs, outputs and the energy required to transform inputs to outputs.  Use of energy during transformation also implies a passage of time: a process takes [[Real-time computing|real time]] to perform its associated action.  A process also requires space for input/output objects and transforming objects to exist: a process uses real space.

A process system is a specialized [[system]] of processes.  Processes are composed of processes.  Complex processes are made up of several processes that are in turn made up of several processes.  This results in an overall structural [[hierarchy]] of [[abstraction]].  If the process system is studied hierarchically, it is easier to understand and manage; therefore, process architecture requires the ability to consider process systems hierarchically. Graphical modeling of process architectures is considered by [[dualistic Petri nets]]. Mathematical consideration of process architectures may be found in [[Calculus of communicating systems|CCS]] and the [[π-calculus]].

The structure of a process system, or its architecture, can be viewed as a dualistic relationship of its [[infrastructure]] and suprastructure.&lt;ref name=parch/&gt;&lt;ref name=ss7arch&gt;Dawis, E. P. (2001).  Architecture of an SS7 Protocol Stack on a Broadband Switch Platform using Dualistic Petri Nets.  Communications, Computers and signal Processing, 2001. PACRIM. 2001 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Volume 1, 2001 Page(s):323 - 326 vol.1&lt;/ref&gt;  The infrastructure describes a process system's component parts and their interactions.  The suprastructure considers the super system of which the process system is a part.  (Suprastructure should not be confused with [[superstructure]], which is actually part of the infrastructure built for (external) support.)  As one traverses the process architecture from one level of abstraction to the next, infrastructure becomes the basis for suprastructure and vice versa as one looks within a system or without.  

Requirements for a process system are derived at every hierarchical level.&lt;ref name=ss7arch/&gt;  Black-box requirements for a system come from its suprastructure.  Customer requirements are black-box requirements near, if not at, the top of a process architecture's hierarchy.  White-box requirements, such as engineering rules, programming [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]], etc., come from the process system's infrastructure.

Process systems are a dualistic phenomenon of change/no-change or form/transform and as such, are 
well-suited to being modeled by the bipartite [[Petri nets]] modeling system and in particular, process-class [[dualistic Petri nets]] where processes can be simulated in real time and space and studied hierarchically.

'''Robert J. Cox''' [[FRSE]] (6 May 1845 – 2 June 1899) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[gelatine]] and [[glue]] manufacturer and [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]] politician.

==Family and education==

Cox was the son of George Cox of [[Gorgie]], a district of [[Edinburgh]] and his wife Isabella (née Craig), the daughter of Robert Craig, a surgeon from [[Peebles]].&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 19 July 1895 p15&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Loretto School]], the [[University of St Andrews]] and the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;''Who was Who''; OUP, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 1875, he married Harriet Sophia Bennett (1850-1905), the daughter of the eminent physician and [[physiologist]] [[John Hughes Bennett|Professor John Hughes Bennett]] of the Institute of Medicine at the University of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onc.ed.ac.uk/jhbl/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204091037/http://www.onc.ed.ac.uk/jhbl/history.htm |archivedate=4 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may have had a son, also Robert Cox, who died in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;http://thepeerage.com/p12534.htm#i125337&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
From 1874, Cox was the sole partner of J &amp; G Cox, Ltd gelatine and glue manufacturers of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;The Times,  19 July 1895 p15&lt;/ref&gt; He was later Chairman of the [[Madelvic Motor Carriage Company]] Ltd of [[Granton, Edinburgh|Granton]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Motor Car Journal, Volume 1'', Cordingley &amp; Co, 1899 p217&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885 he was living at 34 Drumsheugh Gardens in Edinburgh's West End.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1885-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Cox took an interest in local politics. At one time or another he sat as a member of the Mid Lothian County Council, Edinburgh Parish Council (of which he was Chairman of the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1894|Landward Committee]]), Edinburgh Town Council and the [[History of education in Scotland|School Board]].&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 19 July 1895 p15&lt;/ref&gt;

Cox first stood for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] at a by-election in the [[Kirkcaldy Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Kirkcaldy Burghs constituency]] on 11 March 1892.&lt;ref&gt;F W S Craig, ''British Parliamentary Election Results 1885–1918'';Macmillan, 1974 p514&lt;/ref&gt; Cox was selected as the Unionist candidate for the seat, which had become vacant on the death of the sitting [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]], [[George Campbell (1824–1892)|Sir George Campbell]].&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 27 February 1892 p12&lt;/ref&gt; However Cox was unsuccessful, the seat being held for the Liberals by a majority of 1,036 votes,&lt;ref&gt;F W S Craig, ''British Parliamentary Election Results 1885–1918'';Macmillan, 1974 p514&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Henry Dalziel, 1st Baron Dalziel of Kirkcaldy|J H Dalziel]], a journalist and later newspaper proprietor.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 27 February 1892 p12&lt;/ref&gt;

Cox did not contest the [[United Kingdom general election, 1892|1892 general election]] but in June 1895 the Unionist Association of the [[Edinburgh East (UK Parliament constituency)|East Edinburgh division]] approached him as a possible candidate.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 26 June 1895 p10&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberal MP for the seat, [[Robert Wallace (Edinburgh MP)|Robert Wallace]] was reported to have fallen foul of his local Liberal Association on the issue of [[Irish Home Rule]] and they had selected a [[Martin White (politician)|Mr J Martin White]] to fight the seat instead. It was thought possible that Wallace would stand as an independent and create a three-cornered contest.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 26 June 1895 p10&lt;/ref&gt; In the end Wallace and the East Edinburgh Liberals must have mended their fences as Wallace stood again as a Liberal at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1895|1895 general election]]&lt;ref&gt;F W S Craig, ''British Parliamentary Election Results 1885–1918'';Macmillan, 1974 p498&lt;/ref&gt; and White successfully contested [[Forfar (UK Parliament constituency)|Fofarshire]] in the Liberal interest.&lt;ref&gt;F W S Craig, ''British Parliamentary Election Results 1885–1918'';Macmillan, 1974 p541&lt;/ref&gt;

Cox declined the offer to stand in Edinburgh East (or it was withdrawn) and instead was adopted as Liberal Unionist candidate for the [[Edinburgh South (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh South division]]. He narrowly defeated the sitting Liberal MP, [[Herbert Paul]], turning a Liberal majority of 431 into a Unionist one of just 97.&lt;ref&gt;F W S Craig, ''British Parliamentary Election Results 1885–1918'';Macmillan, 1974 p499&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other appointments and interests==
Cox served as a [[Justice of the Peace]] for [[Midlothian|Mid Lothian]] and was sometime [[Deputy Lieutenant]] for the [[County of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;''Who was Who''; OUP, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as President of the [[Rights of way in Scotland|Scottish Rights of Way Association]].&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 13 December 1898 p7&lt;/ref&gt; Cox had a wide range of intellectual interests. He was particularly concerned with philosophy and [[astronomy]]. He was a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], a Fellow of the [[Royal Scottish Society of Arts]] and Vice-President of the Edinburgh Philosophical Institution.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 19 July 1895 p15&lt;/ref&gt; He employed [[William Peck (astronomer)|William Peck]] to run a private [[observatory]] at [[Murrayfield]] and later donated his telescopes to the [[City Observatory]] on [[Calton Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astronomyedinburgh.org/publications/booklet/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, Cox was elected a Fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_034/34_001_003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Cox was also a member of the [[Royal Company of Archers]], the ceremonial unit that served as the [[Sovereign's Bodyguard]] in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 19 July 1895 p15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Cox was in poor health towards the end of his life. He died at [[Aix-les-Bains]] on 2 June 1899, aged 54.&lt;ref&gt;''Annual register'';J Dodsley, 1900 p154&lt;/ref&gt;

He is buried in [[Dean Cemetery]] in Edinburgh, in its north-east section not far from the entrance. He is also memorialised on his parent's grave in St Cuthbert's churchyard in the city centre.

[[Image:Schurmann name.jpg|framed|right|&lt;small&gt;''Schürmann Family''&lt;/small&gt;]]
'''The Schürmann Family''' is the first [[Brazil]]ian family to circumnavigate the world on a [[sailboat]] and the only Brazilian family to have done it three times. The family has been active around the world through their online school program, as well as their films and TV programs such as [[Rede Globo]], [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]] among others.

In 1984 [[Vilfredo schurmann|Vilfredo]], Heloisa and their children left their home, work and school and set off from [[Florianópolis]], the capital city of the State of Santa Catarina, in southern Brazil, to pursue their dream: circumnavigate the world on a sailboat. Their children, Pierre, David and Wilhelm, were 15, 10 and 7 years old, respectively. On this first adventure, the Schürmann Family spent 10 years at sea.

In 1997 the Schürmann Family began their second great adventure [[Magellan Global Adventure]]. The goal was to retrace the route sailed by [[Ferdinand Magellan]]’s fleet, the first complete circumnavigation of the planet's history. For this adventure, apart from the Vilfredo and Heloisa only their son [[David Schurmann|David Schürmann]] and Kat, their 5-year-old daughter went along. Magellan Global Adventure was followed by more than 1,5 million people, from 44 countries. Every month the adventure’s filmed reports, were broadcast internationally, with an average of 40 million television viewers in Brazil and many more around the world. After 30 months, the Schürmanns' yacht returned to Brazil.

In 2011, the Schürmanns led the expedition that for the first time in Brazilian history a [[World War II]] German [[U-boat]] was located in its waters. After 9 years research and 2 years of seagoing searches the U-513 was located 85km east of their hometown of [[Florianópolis]]. The find was announced worldwide on June 17th 2011, when the Schürmanns produced images of a Side-scanning sonar. 

In Vilfredo’s words, “the bond that keeps our family so united is that we were, are and will be dreamers. Forever.”

On September 21, 2014, the Schurmann Family set off on their new sustainable sailboat to sail around the world for the third circumnavigation: The Orient Expedition followed the routes of the Chinese that, according to controversial theories, were the first sailors to travel around the globe, before Ferdinand Magellan. The new project brought aboard innovation, technology and sustainability. The children Pierre and David (land crew leader) participated in some sections of the adventure whereas Wilhelm (Skipper) was onboard throughout the expedition. The youngest, Kat will be symbolically present by inspiring the name of the new sailboat. And, for the first time, the crew gets a representative of the third generation: Emmanuel, he will accompany his grandparents throughout the voyage.

The Orient Expedition also involves important actions, such as an educational project in partnership with Estácio and the production of National Geographic and a feature documentary. Based on samples collected during the trip, the Biological Oceanography Department of a renowned university (USP) have conducted a study with quality analyses of waters and planktons where the boat sailed

In the context of [[Production (economics)|production]], a '''split-off point''' is the point at which joint products appear in the production process.&lt;ref&gt;Wouters, Mark; Selto, Frank H.; Hilton, Ronald W.; Maher, Michael W. (2012): ''Cost Management: Strategies for Business Decisions'', International Edition, Berkshire (UK), p. 532.&lt;/ref&gt;

Example:

When the Entity is carrying on the business with two subsidiaries,one subsidiary is making huge profits and another subsidiary making huge losses.....while preparing the financial statements of the company, the company showing no profit and no loss,and these will not attract the investors.The company got the idea to form independent companies so that it can be easily measurable and it can decide the future of the companies and where developments required for the companies.

'''''Stratton's Independence, Ltd. v. Howbert''''', 231 U.S. 399 (1913),&lt;ref name=supreme&gt;{{ussc|name=Stratton's Independence, Ltd. v. Howbert|link=|volume=231|page=399|pin=|year=1913}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, was a case before the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] that addressed the question of [[Corporate tax|corporate taxation]].

==Case==
The case was argued on October 21, 1913, and decided on December 1, 1913.

Stratton's Independence, Limited, a British corporation that owned and operated mines in [[Colorado]], sued in a district court to recover taxes it had paid under protest in accordance with the provisions of the [[Corporation Tax Act of 1909]]. During the year 1909, the firm had had gross sales of $284,682.85 and costs of $190,939.42, resulting in a profit of $93,743.43. In 1910, the figures had been similar. &lt;ref name=supreme/&gt;

===Plaintiff's argument===
Stratton's contended that the mining and sale of [[ore]] was an essentially different sort of activity than manufacturing, because it involved the depletion and sale of capital, and should therefore not be taxed in the same way, because taxing the sale of ore amounted to taxing capital.&lt;ref name=supreme/&gt;

===Majority opinion===
[[Justice Pitney]], in the majority opinion, stated that the case raised three questions. The first was whether or not the Corporate Tax Act applied to mining corporations. The second question raised was whether or not proceeds from mining activities constituted "income" by the definition of the act. The final question related to whether or not ore sales were considered income and therefore if the mining corporation could deduct the value of the ore in place before it was mined as depreciation. The court answered the first two questions in the affirmative, but not the third. Mining, Justice Pitney argued, is generally comparable to manufacturing, and is certainly a business; hence, the gains from this activity should be considered income for the purposes of taxation.&lt;ref name=supreme/&gt;

[[Chief Justice White]], [[Justice McKenna]], and [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.|Justice Holmes]] dissented on the third question.&lt;ref name=supreme/&gt;

==Significance==
The case represented one of the Supreme Court's early attempts to define the term “income.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Rosenberg| first =Joshua; Daher, Dominic| title =The Law of Federal Income Taxation| work =Hornbook Series| url =https://books.google.no/books?id=iFvaCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT104&amp;lpg=PT104&amp;dq=Stratton%27s+Independence,+Ltd.+v.+Howbert&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=plswoeGCL9&amp;sig=ZAwMU6xERSdHJPTaaU4T2fMgCoc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYsZDwrOHNAhVC1ywKHU6kAC0Q6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Stratton's%20Independence%2C%20Ltd.%20v.%20Howbert&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Pitney's description of income as “the gain derived from capital, from labor, or from both combined” has been widely quoted, as has his comment that “the corporation tax act of 1909 was not intended to be and is not, in any proper sense, an [[income tax]] law.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tax-freedom.com/WhatIsIncome.htm | title=What Is Constitutional Taxable Income ? | work=Tax Freedom | accessdate=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tax-freedom.com/WhereDoesIncomeComeFrom.htm | title=WHERE DOES INCOME COME FROM ? | work=Tax Freedom | accessdate=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case has been cited (unsuccessfully) in such cases as ''[[Hill v. United States]]'' and ''[[Cameron v. Internal Revenue Service]], in support of the argument that a tax on an individual's income is unconstitutional, even though the decision in Stratton did not rule either corporate or individual income tax unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iFvaCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT104&amp;lpg=PT104&amp;dq=Stratton%27s+Independence,+Ltd.+v.+Howbert+income&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=plsyn9KEQ9&amp;sig=Xc6B-rGgUe9JopYQ6RQYMC9crVU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtmKW_qJfOAhUB04MKHV-eBFQQ6AEIPDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Stratton's%20Independence%2C%20Ltd.%20v.%20Howbert%20income&amp;f=false | title=The Law of Federal Income Taxation | publisher=Hornbook | author=Rosenberg, Joshua; Daher, Dominic | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLxBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA159&amp;lpg=PA159&amp;dq=Stratton%27s+Independence,+Ltd.+v.+Howbert+income&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TU41Zz_VYP&amp;sig=0NR2DknaS7l8GzYgUvYk94mcemQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtmKW_qJfOAhUB04MKHV-eBFQQ6AEIRjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Stratton's%20Independence%2C%20Ltd.%20v.%20Howbert%20income&amp;f=false | title=Federal Income Tax Laws Correlated and Annotated | publisher=John Byrne &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Great Game: The Emergence of Wall Street as a World Power: 1653–2000''''' is a non-fiction book on business history by [[John Steele Gordon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Great-Game-Emergence-1653-2000/dp/0684832879|publisher=[[amazon.com]]|title =The Great Game: The Emergence of Wall Street as a World Power: 1653–2000|accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/939352.The_Great_Game?from_search=true&amp;search_version=service|publisher=[[goodreads.com]]|title=The Great Game: The Emergence of Wall Street as a World Power: 1653–2000|accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was initially published on November 16, 1999 by [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]].

==Overview==
In this book, Gordon focuses on the history of American finance industry and Wall Street, telling many interesting stories along the way such as how [[Chase (bank)|Chase Manhattan]] started off as a water company and why [[Merrill Lynch]] was named after two brokers, and not one. The book explains many concepts about how the stock market has shaped itself into one we know it today, including stories about the first corner in the Wall Street history to the most recent, the Hunt's brothers attempt to corner the silver market in 1980. Gordon also explains that every time a player misuses the market to his advantage, the invisible hand of Adam Smith pushes the system to correct itself. The books tells about prominent finance personalities, such as [[Jacob Little]], the first great Wall Street plunger; [[Commodore Vanderbilt]], the Street's greatest tactician; [[Hetty Green]], the "richest woman in the world", who was terrified of being poor; [[J. P. Morgan]], the country's most important banker, who twice saved it from economic disaster when the government could not; [[Richard Whitney (financier)|Richard Whitney]], the president of the New York Stock Exchange, who was a thief; and [[Charles E. Merrill]], who brought Wall Street to Main Street and transformed both in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-great-game-john-steele-gordon/1111101963?ean=9780684832876|publisher=[[barnesandnoble.com]]|title=The Great Game: The Emergence of Wall Street as a World Power: 1653–2000|accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{quote|This sparkling account (the basis for a forthcoming CNBC TV special) finds in Wall Street a remarkable microcosm for American invention, eccentricity, and double-dealing. Compressing centuries of economic arcana and dozens of complicated characters into a concise history is no easy task. But Gordon (Hamilton’s Blessing, 1997, not reviewed), an American Heritage business-history columnist and a commentator for PRI’s Marketplace, manages to make it all go down smoothly. He shows how from the time of its original Dutch builders, Wall Street assumed a cosmopolitan, commercial character. Opposing this tendency was the Jeffersonian suspicion of any central banking system, leading America’s financial markets to rely for their smooth functioning not on the government but on the sense and good will of individual companies. Although this lack of interference permitted the rise of such financial geniuses as [[Commodore Vanderbilt]], [[J.P. Morgan]], and [[Charles E. Merrill|Charles Merrill]], it also gave free rein to Wall Street’s classic rogues, including [[Ivan Boesky]], [[Richard Whitney (financier)|Richard Whitney]], [[Jay Gould]], and [[James Fisk (financier)|Jim Fisk]]. ... Gordon discloses how Wall Street was responsible for many major institutions taken for granted in American life, including modern accounting, fast food, and zoning laws.|''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/john-steele-gordon/the-great-game/|publisher=[[kirkusreviews.com]]|title=THE GREAT GAME The Emergence of Wall Street as a World Power, 1653–2000 by John Steele Gordon|accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Personal life==

Dyer was born in London in 1830, but moved to [[Sydney]] in 1839.&lt;ref name="dyer" /&gt; In Sydney, he had two sons, including Frederick James Dyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cyclopedia of New Zealand : Otago &amp; Southland Provincial Districts |year=1905 |url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz//tm/scholarly/tei-Cyc04Cycl-t1-body1-d7-d78-d5.html |publisher=[[The Cyclopedia of New Zealand]] |author=Cyclopedia Company Limited |accessdate= 30 January 2017 |location=Christchurch |chapter=Dyer, Frederick James}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to New Zealand in 1857.
