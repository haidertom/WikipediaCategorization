'''Agricultural geography''' is a subdiscipline of [[human geography]] concerned with the spatial relationships found between agriculture and humans. 

== Focus ==
It is traditionally considered the branch of [[economic geography]] that investigates those parts of the [[Earth's surface]] that are transformed by humans through [[primary sector]] activities for consumption. It thus focuses on the different types of structures of agricultural landscapes and asks for the cultural, political, and environmental processes that lead to these spatial patterns. While most research in this area concentrates rather on production than on consumption,&lt;ref&gt;Laingen, C. &amp; L. Butler Harrington (2013): Agricultural Geography. ''Oxford Bibliographies''. [[Oxford University Press]]. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/OBO/9780199874002-006 DOI 10.1093/OBO/9780199874002-006]&lt;/ref&gt; a distinction can be made between [[nomothetic]] (e.g. distribution of spatial agricultural patterns and processes) and [[idiographic]] research (e.g. human-environment interaction and the shaping of agricultural landscapes). The latter approach of agricultural geography is often applied within [[regional geography]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4819">The '''American Association of Public Health Dentistry''' (AAPHD), founded in 1937, focuses upon addressing the public health challenges to oral health at the population level. Its open membership for everyone who seeks improvement in oral health of the general public. supports developing and supporting effective programs of oral health promotion and disease prevention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaphd.org/ Home page for the American Association of Public Health Dentistry (AAPHD)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaphd.org/abdph American Board of Dental Public Health]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is headquartered in [[Springfield, Illinois]].

== Mission ==
[[Public health]] dentistry is defined as by [[TheFreeDictionary.com]] as "that specialty of dentistry concerned with the prevention and control of dental diseases and promotion of oral health through organized community efforts."

== Organization ==

The American Association of Public Health Dentistry was founded in 1937.  AAPHD publishes a newsletter for AAPHD members and a journal, the Journal of Public Health Dentistry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1752-7325 Journal of Public Health Dentistry. Wiley Online Library]&lt;/ref&gt;  It offers online continuing education courses for public health dentists in oral health literacy, dental public health policy and advocacy, and professional dental ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaphd.org/online-dental-public-health-courses Dental Public Health online courses]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since October 2014, Julie Frantsve-Hawley, PhD,&lt;ref&gt;Genetics, Biological and Biomedical Sciences program, Harvard University, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; has been the Executive Director of AAPHD.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.linkedin.com/in/julie-frantsve-hawley-b376b631/ LinkedIn article for Julie Frantsve-Hawley, PhD]&lt;/ref&gt;  She had been with [[American Dental Association]] before and had edited journals in [[evidence-based dentistry]].

Each year it plans a National Oral Health Conference® (NOHC) in the United States, which next will be held from April 16–18, 2018 in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.NationalOralHealthConference.com AAPHD's NOHC Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

AAPHD student chapters are found in major US dental schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/academics/sdm/programs/pediatric-dentistry/cags-combined/ Combined CAGS in Pediatric Dentistry: Combined Pediatric Dentistry and Dental Public Health, Goldman School of Dental Medicine’s Department of Pediatric Dentistry website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bu.edu/dental/students/organizations/aaphd/ Home page of the Student Chapter of the American Association of Public Health Dentistry (AAPHD)] of the [[Boston University]] [[Henry M.

'''{{lang|la|Anno Mundi}}''' ([[Latin]] for "in the year of the world"; [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]:&amp;nbsp;{{hebrew|לבריאת העולם}}, "to the creation of the world"), abbreviated as '''AM''', or '''Year After Creation''',&lt;ref name=YearAfterCreationChronology /&gt; is a [[calendar era]] based on the [[Bible|biblical]] accounts of the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] of the world and subsequent history. Two such calendar eras have seen notable use historically:
*The [[Byzantine calendar]] was used  in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and many Christian Orthodox countries and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es and was based on the [[Septuagint]] text of the Bible. That calendar is similar to the [[Julian calendar]] except that its [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] is equivalent to 1 September 5509 BC on the [[Julian proleptic calendar]].
*Since the Middle Ages, the [[Hebrew calendar]] has been based on rabbinic calculations of the year of creation from the Hebrew [[Masoretic text]] of the bible. This calendar is used within Jewish communities for religious and other purposes. On the Hebrew calendar, the day begins at sunset. The calendar's epoch, corresponding to the calculated date of the world's creation, is equivalent to sunset on the Julian proleptic calendar date 6 October 3761 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Dershowitz |first1=Nachum |author1-link=Nachum Dershowitz|last2=Reingold |first2=Edward M. |author2-link=Edward M. Reingold|title=Calendrical Calculations |edition=1st |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |ISBN=0-521-56474-3 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new year begins at [[Rosh Hashanah]], roughly in September. Year ''anno mundi'' {{#time:xjY}}, or AM {{#time:xjY}}, began at sunset on {{#time:j F Y|@{{Hebrew year/rhdatum}}-1 day}} on the [[Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hebcal.com/converter/?gd=13&amp;gm=9&amp;gy=2015&amp;gs=on&amp;g2h=1&lt;/ref&gt;

While differences in biblical interpretation or in calculation methodology can produce some differences in the creation date, most results fall relatively close to one of these two dominant models. The primary reason for the disparity seems to lie in which underlying Biblical text is chosen (roughly 5500 BC based on the Greek Septuagint text, about 3750 BC based on the Hebrew Masoretic text). Most of the 1,732-year difference resides in numerical discrepancies in the genealogies of the two versions of the [[Book of Genesis]]. Patriarchs from Adam to [[Terah]], the father of [[Abraham]], are said to be older by as much as 100 years or more when they begat their named son in the Greek Septuagint&lt;ref name=LXX5&gt;{{cite web|title=Septuagint GENESIS – 5|url=http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/physis/septuagint-genesis/5.asp|work=The Greek Old Testament (Septuagint)|publisher=Elpenor|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LXX11&gt;{{cite web|title=Septuagint GENESIS – 11|url=http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/physis/septuagint-genesis/11.asp|work=The Greek Old Testament (Septuagint)|publisher=Elpenor|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; than they were in the Latin [[Vulgate]] ({{bibleref|Genesis|5|4}}; {{bibleref|Genesis|11|4}}) or the Hebrew [[Tanakh]] ({{bibleref|Gen|5|JPR}}; {{bibleref|Gen|11|JPR}}). The net difference between the two major [[genealogies of Genesis]] is 1466 years (ignoring the "second year after the flood" ambiguity), 85% of the total difference. (See [[Dating creation]].)

==Jewish tradition==
{{see| Hebrew calendar}}
During the Talmudic era, from the 1st to the 10th centuries AD, the center of the Jewish world was in the Middle East, primarily in the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia|Talmudic Academies of Babylonia]] and [[Talmudic Academies in the Land of Israel|Israel]]. Jews in these regions used [[Seleucid Era]] dating (also known as the "Anno Graecorum (AG)" or the "Era of Contracts") as the primary method for calculating the calendar year.&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AvVPlyYjX7YC&amp;pg=PA295 Chronology of the Old Testament, Dr. Floyd Nolen Jones] "When the center of Jewish life moved from Babylonia to Europe during the 8th and 9th centuries AD, calculations from the Seleucid era became meaningless. Over those centuries, it was replaced by that of the ''anno mundi'' era of the ''Seder Olam''. From the 11th century, ''anno mundi'' dating became dominant throughout most of the world's Jewish communities."&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the writings of [[Josephus]] and the [[Books of the Maccabees]] used Seleucid Era dating exclusively, and the [[Talmud]] tractate [[Avodah Zarah]] states:
{{quote|[[Rav]] [[Aha b. Jacob]] then put this question: How do we know that our Era [of Documents] is connected with the Kingdom of Greece at all? Why not say that it is reckoned from the Exodus from Egypt, omitting the first thousand years and giving the years of the next thousand? In that case, the document is really post-dated!

Said [[Rav Nachman|Rav Nahman]]: In the Diaspora the Greek Era alone is used. He [the questioner] thought that Rav Nahman wanted to dispose of him anyhow, but when he went and studied it thoroughly he found that it is indeed taught [in a [[Baraita]]]: In the Diaspora the Greek Era alone is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Atenebris Adsole |url=http://www.halakhah.com/zarah/zarah_10.html |title=Avodah Zarah, tractate 10 |publisher=Halakhah.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Occasionally in Talmudic writings, reference was made to other starting points for eras, such as Destruction Era dating,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halakhah.com/zarah/zarah_9.html Avodah Zarah, tractate 9] Footnote: "The Eras in use among Jews in Talmudic Times are: (a) ERA OF CONTRACTS [H] dating from the year 380 before the Destruction of the Second Temple (312–1 BC) when, at the Battle of Gaza, Seleucus Nicator, one of the followers of Alexander the Great, gained dominion over Palestine. It is also termed Seleucid or Greek Era [H]. Its designation as Alexandrian Era connecting it with Alexander the Great (Maim. Yad, Gerushin 1, 27) is an anachronism, since Alexander died in 323 BC — eleven years before this Era began (v. E. Mahler, Handbuch der judischen Chronologie, p. 145). This Era, which is first mentioned in Mac. I, 10, and was used by notaries or scribes for dating all civil contracts, was generally in vogue in eastern countries till the 16th cent, and was employed even in the 19th cent, among the Jews of Yemen, in South Arabia (Eben Saphir, Lyck, 1866, p. 62b). (b) THE ERA OF THE DESTRUCTION (of the Second Temple) [H] the year 1 of which corresponds to 381 of the Seleucid Era, and 69–70 of the Christian Era. This Era was mainly employed by the Rabbis and was in use in Palestine for several centuries, and even in the later Middle Ages documents were dated by it. One of the recently discovered Genizah documents bears the date 13 Tammuz 987 after the Destruction of the Temple — i.e. 917 C.E. — (Op. cit. p. 152, also Marmorstein ZDMG, Vol. VI, p. 640). The difference between the two Eras as far as the tens and units are concerned is thus 20. If therefore a Tanna, say in the year 156 Era of Dest. (225 C.E.), while remembering, naturally, the century, is uncertain about the tens and units, he should ask the notary what year it is according to his — Seleucid — era. He will get the answer 536 (156 + 380), on adding 20 to which he would get 556, the last two figures giving him the year [1] 56 of the Era of Destruction."&lt;/ref&gt; being the number of years since the AD 70 [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of the Second Temple]], and the number of years since the [[dating Creation|Creation year]] based on the calculation in the [[Seder Olam Rabbah]] of Rabbi [[Jose ben Halafta]] in about AD 160.&lt;ref&gt;p. 107, Kantor&lt;/ref&gt; By his calculation, based on the [[Masoretic Text]], [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] were created on 1st of Tishrei ([[Rosh Hashanah]] Day 1) in 3760 BC,&lt;ref name=BirthdayAdamEve&gt;{{cite web|title=Birthday of Adam &amp; Eve (3760 BC)|url=http://www.chabad.org/calendar/view/day_cdo/aid/150485/jewish/Adam-Eve.htm|work=Jewish History|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Creation&gt;{{cite web|title=Creation (3761 BC)|url=http://www.chabad.org/calendar/view/day_cdo/aid/156820/jewish/Creation.htm|work=Jewish History|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JewishYear&gt;"To find the corresponding Jewish year for any year on the Gregorian calendar, add 3760 to the Gregorian number, if it is before Rosh Hashanah. After Rosh Hashanah, add 3761. " {{cite web|title=The Jewish year|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/526875/jewish/The-Jewish-Year.htm|work=About the Jewish Calendar|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; later confirmed by the Muslim chronologist [[al-Biruni]] as 3448 years before the [[Seleucid era]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the c. 8th-century AD [[Baraita of Samuel]].

In the 8th and 9th centuries AD, the center of Jewish life moved from Babylonia to Europe, so calculations from the Seleucid era "became meaningless".&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt; From the 11th century, ''anno mundi'' dating became dominant throughout most of the world's Jewish communities, replacing the Seleucid dating system.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0umDqPOf2L8C&amp;pg=PA87 |title=The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era, Alden A. Mosshammer |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new system reached its definitive form in AD 1178 when [[Maimonides]] completed the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]''. In the section ''Sanctification of the Moon'' (11.16), he wrote of his choice of Epoch, from which calculations of all dates should be made, as "the third day of Nisan in this present year ... which is the year 4938 of the creation of the world" (March 22, AD 1178).&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Gandz, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3622160 Date of Composition of Maimonides Code], ''Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research'', 17 (1947–1948), pp. 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; He included all the rules for the calculated calendar epoch and their scriptural basis, including the modern epochal year in his work, and establishing the final formal usage of the ''anno mundi'' era.

The first year of the Jewish calendar, Anno Mundi 1 (AM 1), began about one year before Creation, so that year is also called the Year of emptiness. The first five days of Jewish Creation week occupy the last five days of AM 1, Elul 25–29. The sixth day of Creation, when [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] were created, is the first day of AM 2, [[Rosh Hashanah]] (1 Tishrei). Its associated [[molad]] Adam (molad VaYaD) occurred on Day 5 (yom Vav) at 14 (Yud Daled) hours (and 0 parts). A year earlier, the first day of AM 1, Rosh Hashanah (1 Tishrei), is associated with [[molad tohu#Anno Mundi|molad tohu]] (new moon of chaos), so named because it occurred before Creation when everything was still chaotic — it is also translated as the new moon of nothing. This is also called molad BaHaRaD, because it occurred on Day 2 (yom Beis), 5 (Hei) hours, 204 (RaD) parts (11:11:20 pm). Because this is just before midnight when the Western day begins, but after 6 pm when the Jewish calendrical day begins (equivalent to the next tabular day with the same daylight period), its Julian calendar date is 6/7 October 3761 BC (Gregorian: 6/7 September 3761 BC or −3760).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://strangeside.com/calendar-when-does-it-start/ | title=Calendar — when does it start | website=strangeside.com | access-date=October 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tondering.dk/claus/cal/hebrew.php | title=The Hebrew Calendar | last=Tøndering | first=Claus | date=2014 | website=www.tondering.dk | access-date=October 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hebrewcalendar.tripod.com/luachmail.html#029 | title=Is Creation at AM 1 or AM 2? | last=Landau | first=Remy | date=February 16, 2005 | website=hebrewcalendar.tripod.com | access-date=October 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek tradition==

The [[Septuagint]] was the most scholarly non-Hebrew version of the [[Old Testament]] available to [[early Christian]]s. Many converts already spoke Greek, and it was readily adopted as the preferred vernacular-language rendering for the eastern Roman Empire. The later Latin translation called the [[Vulgate]], an [[Christology|interpretative]] translation from the later [[Masoretic Text]] (a Jewish revision and consolidation of earlier Hebrew texts), replaced it in the west after its completion by [[Jerome|St. Jerome]] c. 405, Latin being the most common vernacular language in those regions.

===Earliest Christian chronology===
The earliest extant Christian writings on the age of the world according to the biblical chronology were therefore based on the Septuagint, due to its early availability.

Theophilus presents a detailed chronology "from the foundation of the world" to emperor Marcus Aurelius.&lt;ref name="theophilus"/&gt; His chronology begins with the biblical first man [[Adam]] through to emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]], in whose reign Theophilus lived. The chronology puts the creation of the world at about 5529 BC: "All the years from the creation of the world amount to a total of 5,698 years."&lt;ref name="theophilus"/&gt; No mention of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] is made in his chronology. [[Seraphim Rose]] corrected the date to about 5530 BC, to recognise that there is no year 0 in [[Christian era]] dating.&lt;ref name="GENESIS 2000. p. 236"&gt;Fr. [[Seraphim Rose]].

Dr. Ben Zion Wacholder points out that the writings of the [[Church Fathers]] on this subject are of vital significance (''even though he disagrees with their chronological system based on the authenticity of the [[Septuagint]], as compared to that of the [[Masoretic Text|Hebrew text]]''), in that through the Christian chronographers a window to the earlier Hellenistic biblical chronographers{{refn|1=[[Eratosthenes|Eratosthenes of Cyrene ]] (275–194 BC) represented contemporary Alexandrian scholarship; [[Eupolemus]], a Palestinian Jew and a friend of [[Judas Maccabeus|Judah Maccabee]], writing in 158 BC, is said to have been the first historian who synchronized Greek history in accordance with the theory of the Mosaic origin of culture. By the time of the 1st century BC, a world chronicle had synchronized Jewish and Greek history and had gained international circulation: [[Alexander Polyhistor]] (flourishing in 85–35 BC); [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] (116–27 BC); Ptolemy priest of Mendes (50 BC), who is cited by [[Tatian]] (''Oratio ad Graecos'', 38); [[Apion]] (1st century AD); [[Thrasyllus of Mendes|Thrasyllus]] (before AD 36); and [[Thallus (historian)|Thallus]] (1st century AD) – all cited chronicles which had incorporated the dates of the [[Noachite]] flood and the exodus.

===Alexandrian era===
The [[Byzantine calendar#Alexandrian Era|Alexandrian era]], arising in AD 412, was the precursor to the [[Byzantine era]]. After the initial attempts by [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]], [[Clement of Alexandria]] and others, the Alexandrian computation of the date of creation was worked out to be 25 March 5493 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elias J Bickerman|title=Chronology of the Ancient World (Aspects of Greek &amp; Roman Life) |year=1980|publisher=Cornell Univ. Press|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=0-8014-1282-X|edition=2nd sub|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alexandrian monk [[Panodorus of Alexandria|Panodoros]] reckoned 5904 years from Adam to the year AD 412. His years began with 29 August, corresponding to the [[Thout|First of Thoth]], or the [[Egyptian calendar|Egyptian]] new year.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. Philip Schaff (1819–1893), Ed. "Era." ''[[Schaff–Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge]]''. New Edition, 13 Vols., 1908–14. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc04/Page_163.html Vol. 4, pp. 163].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Annianus of Alexandria]] however, preferred the Annunciation style as New Year's Day, 25 March, and shifted the Panodoros era by about six months, to begin on 25 March. This created the ''Alexandrian era'', whose first day was the first day of the proleptic{{refn|1=A calendar obtained by extension earlier in time than its invention or implementation is called the proleptic version of the calendar.|group=note}} Alexandrian civil year in progress, 29 August 5493 BC, with the ecclesiastical year beginning on 25 March 5493 BC.

:This system presents in a masterly sort of way the mystical coincidence of the three main dates of the world's history: the beginning of Creation, the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]], and the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]. All these events happened, according to the Alexandrian chronology, on the 25th of March; furthermore, the first two events were separated by the period of exactly 5500 years; the first and the third one occurred on Sunday — the sacred day of the beginning of the Creation and its renovation through Christ.&lt;ref name="KUZENKOV-2"&gt;Pavel Kuzenkov (Moscow). "[http://www.wra1th.plus.com/byzcong/comms/Kuzenkov_paper.pdf How old is the World? The Byzantine era κατα Ρωμαίους and its rivals"] ({{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715093926/http://www.wra1th.plus.com/byzcong/comms/Kuzenkov_paper.pdf |date=July 15, 2011 }}) ''21st International Congress of Byzantine Studies'', London 2006. pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Dionysius of Alexandria|Dionysius of Alexandria]] had earlier emphatically quoted mystical justifications for the choice of 25 March as the start of the year:
:March 25 was considered to be the anniversary of Creation itself. It was the first day of the year in the medieval [[Julian calendar]] and the nominal vernal equinox (it had been the actual equinox at the time when the Julian calendar was originally designed). Considering that Christ was conceived at that date turned March 25 into the Feast of the [[Annunciation]] which had to be followed, nine months later, by the celebration of the [[Nativity of Christ|birth of Christ]], Christmas, on December 25.

The ''Alexandrian Era'' of 25 March 5493 BC was adopted by church fathers such as [[Maximus the Confessor]] and [[Theophanes the Confessor]], as well as chroniclers such as [[George Syncellus]]. Its striking mysticism made it popular in Byzantium especially in monastic circles. However this masterpiece of Christian symbolism had two serious weak points: historical inaccuracy surrounding the date of [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] as determined by its [[Easter]] [[w:Computus|computus]],{{refn|1=In the commonly used 19‐year [[Easter]] moon cycle, there was no year when the Passover (the first spring full moon, Nisan 14) would coincide with Friday and the traditional date of the Passion, 25 March; according to Alexandrian system the date would have to have been Anno Mundi 5533 = 42(!)AD.|group=note}} and its contradiction to the chronology of the [[Gospel]] of [[John the Apostle|St John]] regarding the date of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] on Friday after the Passover.&lt;ref name="KUZENKOV-2"/&gt;

===Chronicon Paschale===
A new variant of the ''World Era'' was suggested in the ''[[Chronicon Paschale]]'', a valuable Byzantine universal chronicle of the world, composed about the year AD 630 by some representative of the Antiochian scholarly tradition.&lt;ref name="KUZENKOV-2"/&gt; It dates the creation of [[Adam]] to 21 March 5507 BC.

For its influence on Greek Christian chronology, and also because of its wide scope, the ''"Chronicon Paschale"'' takes its place beside [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], and the chronicle of the monk [[George Syncellus|Georgius Syncellus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[George Syncellus|George Synkellos]]. ''The Chronography of George Synkellos: a Byzantine Chronicle of Universal History from the Creation''. Transl. Prof. Dr. William Adler &amp; Paul Tuffin. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; which was so important in the Middle Ages; but in respect of form it is inferior to these works.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Essen, L. "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03730b.htm Chronicon Paschale]". In ''The Catholic Encyclopedia (New Advent)''. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption of Byzantine era===
The Byzantine Anno Mundi era was the official calendar of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] from c. AD 691 to 1728 in the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarchate]]. By the late 10th century the [[Byzantine era]], which had become fixed at 1 September 5509 BC since at least the mid-7th century (differing by 16 years from the Alexandrian date, and 2 years from the ''[[Chronicon Paschale]]''), had become the widely accepted calendar by [[Chalcedonian Christianity]]. The Byzantine era was used as the civil calendar by the [[Byzantine Empire]] from AD 988 to 1453, and by [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]] from c. AD 988 to 1700.

The computation was derived from the [[Septuagint]] version of the [[Bible]], and placed the date of creation at 5509 years before the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]], which was later taken to mean 5509 BC when conversions to the Christian era were desired. With a new year date of September 1, which coincides with the beginning of the Orthodox liturgical year, its epoch became 1 September 5509 BC (Julian), and year AM 1 thus lasted until 31 August 5508 BC. The "year of creation" was generally expressed in Greek in the Byzantine calendar as "Etos Kosmou", literally "year of the universe".

===Western church===
Western Christianity never fully adopted an Anno Mundi epoch system, and did not at first produce chronologies based on the Vulgate that were in contrast to the eastern calculations from the Septuagint. Since the Vulgate was not completed until only a few years before the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire#408–410; the end of an effective regular field army, starvation in Italia, sack of Rome|sack of Rome]] by the Goths, there was little time for such developments before the political upheavals that followed in the west. Whatever the reasons, the west eventually came to rely instead on the independently developed [[Anno Domini]] (AD) epoch system. AM dating did continue to be of interest for liturgical reasons, however, since it was of direct relevance to the calculation of the [[Nativity of Jesus]] (AM 5197–5199) and the [[Passion of Christ]] (AM 5228–5231). For example, [[Bede]] in his World-Chronicle (Chapter 66 of his ''[[De Temporum Ratione]]'', On the Reckoning of Time), dated all events using an epoch he derived from the Vulgate which set the birth of Christ as AM 3952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:65Cyb-LB3-apmag.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Asteroid [[65 Cybele]] and two stars, with their magnitudes labeled]]

The '''apparent magnitude''' ('''{{mvar|m}}''') of an [[astronomical object]] is a number that is a measure of its [[brightness]] as seen by an observer on Earth. The magnitude scale is [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]]. A difference of 1 in magnitude corresponds to a change in brightness by a factor of {{radic|100|5}}, or about 2.512. The brighter an object appears, the lower its [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] value (i.e. inverse relation), with the brightest astronomical objects having negative apparent magnitudes: for example [[Sirius]] at −1.46.

The measurement of apparent magnitudes or brightnesses of celestial objects is known as [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. Apparent magnitudes are used to quantify the brightness of sources at [[ultraviolet]], [[Visible spectrum|visible]], and [[infrared]] wavelengths. An apparent magnitude is usually measured in a specific [[passband]] corresponding to some [[photometric system]] such as the [[UBV photometric system|UBV system]]. In standard astronomical notation, an apparent magnitude in the V ("visual") filter band would be denoted either as ''m''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; or often simply as ''V'', as in "''m''&lt;sub&gt;''V''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;15" or "''V''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;15" to describe a 15th-magnitude object.

The scale used to indicate magnitude originates in the [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] practice of dividing stars visible to the naked eye into six ''magnitudes''. The [[List of brightest stars|brightest stars]] in the night sky were said to be of [[first magnitude star|first magnitude]] ({{mvar|m}} = 1), whereas the faintest were of sixth magnitude ({{mvar|m}} = 6), which is the limit of [[human]] [[visual perception]] (without the aid of a [[telescope]]). Each grade of magnitude was considered twice the brightness of the following grade (a [[logarithmic scale]]), although that ratio was subjective as no [[photodetector]]s existed. This rather crude scale for the brightness of stars was popularized by [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'' and is generally believed to have originated with [[Hipparchus]].

In 1856, [[Norman Robert Pogson]] formalized the system by defining a first magnitude star as a star that is 100 times as bright as a sixth-magnitude star, thereby establishing the logarithmic scale still in use today. This implies that a star of magnitude {{mvar|m}} is about 2.512 times as bright as a star of magnitude {{math|''m'' + 1}}. This figure, the [[Generalized continued fraction#Example 2|fifth root of 100]], became known as Pogson's Ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/MNRAS/0017//0000012.000.html |title=Magnitudes of Thirty-six of the Minor Planets for the first day of each month of the year 1857 |authorlink=Norman Robert Pogson |first=N. |last=Pogson |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|MNRAS]] |volume=17 |page=12 |date=1856|bibcode=1856MNRAS..17...12P |doi=10.1093/mnras/17.1.12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The zero point of Pogson's scale was originally defined by assigning [[Polaris]] a magnitude of exactly 2. Astronomers later discovered that Polaris is slightly variable, so they switched to [[Vega]] as the standard reference star, assigning the brightness of Vega as the definition of zero magnitude at any specified wavelength.

Apart from small corrections, the brightness of Vega still serves as the definition of zero magnitude for visible and [[Infrared#ISO 20473 scheme|near infrared]] wavelengths, where its [[spectral energy distribution]] (SED) closely approximates that of a [[black body]] for a temperature of {{val|11000|u=K}}. However, with the advent of [[infrared astronomy]] it was revealed that Vega's radiation includes an [[Infrared excess]] presumably due to a [[circumstellar disk]] consisting of [[Cosmic dust|dust]] at warm temperatures (but much cooler than the star's surface). At shorter (e.g. visible) wavelengths, there is negligible emission from dust at these temperatures. However, in order to properly extend the magnitude scale further into the infrared, this peculiarity of Vega should not affect the definition of the magnitude scale. Therefore, the magnitude scale was extrapolated to ''all'' wavelengths on the basis of the [[Planck's law|black body radiation curve]] for an ideal stellar surface at {{val|11000|u=K}} uncontaminated by circumstellar radiation. On this basis the [[spectral irradiance]] (usually expressed in [[jansky]]s) for the zero magnitude point, as a function of wavelength, can be computed.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://archive.is/20121204144725/http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~patton/astro/mags.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Small deviations are specified between systems using measurement apparatuses developed independently so that data obtained by different astronomers can be properly compared, but of greater practical importance is the definition of magnitude not at a single wavelength but applying to the response of standard spectral filters used in [[Photometry (astronomy)#methods|photometry]] over various wavelength bands.

With the modern magnitude systems, brightness over a very wide range is specified according to the logarithmic definition detailed below, using this zero reference. In practice such apparent magnitudes do not exceed 30 (for detectable measurements). The brightness of Vega is exceeded by four stars in the night sky at visible wavelengths (and more at infrared wavelengths) as well as the bright planets Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, and these must be described by ''negative'' magnitudes. For example, [[Sirius]], the brightest star of the [[celestial sphere]], has an apparent magnitude of −1.4 in the visible. Negative magnitudes for other very bright astronomical objects can be found in the [[#Table of notable celestial objects|table]] below.

Astronomers have developed other photometric zeropoint systems as alternatives to the Vega system. The most widely used is the [[AB magnitude]] system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oke|first1=J. B.|last2=Gunn|first2=J. E.|title=Secondary standard stars for absolute spectrophotometry|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=March 15, 1983|volume=266|pages=713–717|doi=10.1086/160817|bibcode=1983ApJ...266..713O}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which photometric zeropoints are based on a hypothetical reference spectrum having constant [[Spectral flux density|flux per unit frequency interval]], rather than using a stellar spectrum or blackbody curve as the reference. The AB magnitude zeropoint is defined such that an object's AB and Vega-based magnitudes will be approximately equal in the V filter band.

== Calculations ==

[[File:Apparent magnitude.svg|thumb|A graph of apparent magnitude against brightness]]

As the amount of light actually received by a telescope is reduced by transmission through the [[Earth's atmosphere]], any measurement of apparent magnitude is [[Photometry (astronomy)#Calibrations|corrected]] for what it would have been as seen from above the atmosphere. The dimmer an object appears, the higher the numerical value given to its apparent magnitude, with a difference of 5 magnitudes corresponding to a brightness factor of exactly 100. Therefore, the apparent magnitude {{mvar|m}}, in the [[Photometric system|spectral band]] {{mvar|x}}, would be given by

:&lt;math&gt;m_{x}= -5 \log_{100} \left(\frac {F_x}{F_{x,0}}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

which is more commonly expressed in terms of [[Common logarithm|common (base-10) logarithms]] as

:&lt;math&gt;m_{x} = -2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac {F_x}{F_{x,0}}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|F&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the observed [[flux density]] using spectral filter {{mvar|x}}, and {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;''x'',0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the reference flux (zero-point) for that [[Photometric system#Filters used|photometric filter]]. Since an increase of 5 magnitudes corresponds to a decrease in brightness by a factor of exactly 100, each magnitude increase implies a decrease in brightness by the factor {{radic|100|5}} ≈&amp;nbsp;2.512 (Pogson's ratio). Inverting the above formula, a magnitude difference {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} Δ''m''}} implies a brightness factor of

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{F_2}{F_1} = 100^\frac{\Delta m}{5} = 10^{0.4 \Delta m} \approx 2.512^{\Delta m}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example: Sun and Moon ===
''What is the ratio in brightness between the [[Sun]] and the full [[Moon]]?''

The apparent magnitude of the Sun is −26.74 (brighter), and the mean apparent magnitude of the [[full moon]] is −12.74 (dimmer).

Difference in magnitude: 
:&lt;math&gt; x = m_1 - m_2 = (-12.74) - (-26.74) = 14.00. &lt;/math&gt;

Brightness factor: 
:&lt;math&gt; v_b = 10^{0.4 x} = 10^{0.4 \times 14.00} \approx 398\,107.17. &lt;/math&gt;

The Sun appears about {{val|400000}} times brighter than the full moon.

===Magnitude addition===
Sometimes one might wish to add brightnesses. For example, [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] on closely separated [[double star]]s may only be able to produce a measurement of their combined light output. How would we reckon the combined magnitude of that double star knowing only the magnitudes of the individual components? This can be done by adding the brightnesses (in linear units) corresponding to each magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magnitude Arithmetic|url=http://www.caglow.com/info/wtopic/mag-arith|work=Weekly Topic|publisher=Caglow|accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; 10^{-m_f \times 0.4} = 10^{-m_1 \times 0.4} + 10^{-m_2 \times 0.4}. &lt;/math&gt;

Solving for &lt;math&gt;m_f&lt;/math&gt; yields
:&lt;math&gt; m_f = -2.5\log_{10} \left(10^{-m_1 \times 0.4} + 10^{-m_2 \times 0.4} \right), &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|m&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the resulting magnitude after adding the brightnesses referred to by {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

===Absolute magnitude===
{{main|Absolute magnitude}}
Since flux decreases with distance according to the [[inverse-square law]], a particular apparent magnitude could equally well refer to a star at one distance, or a star four times brighter at twice that distance, and so on. When one is not interested in the brightness as viewed from Earth, but the ''intrinsic'' brightness of an astronomical object, then one refers not to the apparent magnitude but the absolute magnitude. The absolute magnitude {{mvar|M}}, of a star or astronomical object is defined as the apparent magnitude it would have as seen from a distance of 10 [[parsec]]s (about 32.6 [[light-year]]s). The absolute magnitude of the Sun is 4.83 in the V band (yellow) and 5.48 in the B band (blue).&lt;ref name="Bband"&gt;{{cite web

It is important to note that the scale is [[logarithm]]ic: the relative brightness of two objects is determined by the difference of their magnitudes. For example, a difference of 3.2 means that one object is about 19 times as bright as the other, because [[Apparent magnitude#History|Pogson's Ratio]] raised to the power 3.2 is approximately 19.05.

A common misconception is that the logarithmic nature of the scale is because the [[human eye]] itself has a logarithmic response. In Pogson's time this was thought to be true (see [[Weber–Fechner law]]), but it is now believed that the response is a [[power law]] (see [[Stevens' power law]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Misconceptions About Astronomical Magnitudes|authorlink=Eric Schulman|first1=E.|last1=Schulman|first2=C. V.|last2=Cox|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=65|issue=10|page=1003|date=1997|bibcode = 1997AmJPh..65.1003S |doi = 10.1119/1.18714 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnitude is complicated by the fact that light is not [[monochromatic]]. The sensitivity of a light detector varies according to the wavelength of the light, and the way it varies depends on the type of light detector. For this reason, it is necessary to specify how the magnitude is measured for the value to be meaningful. For this purpose the [[UBV system]] is widely used, in which the magnitude is measured in three different wavelength bands: U (centred at about 350&amp;nbsp;nm, in the near [[ultraviolet]]), B (about 435&amp;nbsp;nm, in the blue region) and V (about 555&amp;nbsp;nm, in the middle of the human visual range in daylight). The V band was chosen for spectral purposes and gives magnitudes closely corresponding to those seen by the light-adapted human eye, and when an apparent magnitude is given without any further qualification, it is usually the V magnitude that is meant, more or less the same as visual magnitude.

Because cooler stars, such as [[red giant]]s and [[red dwarf]]s, emit little energy in the blue and UV regions of the spectrum their power is often under-represented by the UBV scale. Indeed, some [[stellar classification|L and T class]] stars have an estimated magnitude of well over 100, because they emit extremely little visible light, but are strongest in [[infrared]].

Measures of magnitude need cautious treatment and it is extremely important to measure like with like. On early 20th century and older orthochromatic (blue-sensitive) [[photographic film]], the relative brightnesses of the blue [[supergiant]] [[Rigel]] and the red supergiant [[Betelgeuse]] irregular variable star (at maximum) are reversed compared to what human eyes perceive, because this archaic film is more sensitive to blue light than it is to red light. Magnitudes obtained from this method are known as [[photographic magnitude]]s, and are now considered obsolete.

For objects within the [[Milky Way]] with a given absolute magnitude, 5 is added to the apparent magnitude for every tenfold increase in the distance to the object. For objects at very great distances (far beyond the Milky Way), this relationship must be [[K correction|adjusted for redshifts]] and for [[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]] distance measures due to [[general relativity]].&lt;ref name=umeh&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2014CQGra..31t5001U|arxiv=1402.1933|title=Nonlinear relativistic corrections to cosmological distances, redshift and gravitational lensing magnification: II.

For planets and other Solar System bodies the apparent magnitude is derived from its [[Phase curve (astronomy)|phase curve]] and the distances to the Sun and observer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4001">The '''Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences''' — known as '''AFRIMS''' — is a [[United States Army]] project that started as a collaboration with the [[government of Thailand]] to fight a [[cholera]] outbreak in [[Bangkok]] in 1958 and '59. It subsequently expanded to cover [[Military medicine|military medical]] research projects (primarily involving [[infectious diseases]]) across much of Southeast Asia and the Indian Subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AFRIMS: History of AFRIMS|url = http://www.afrims.org/afrims-history.html|website = www.afrims.org|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and history==
The mission of the [[US Army]] Medical Component of the Armed Forces Research Institute of the Medical Sciences (USAMC-AFRIMS) is to conduct basic and applied research for development of diagnostic tests, drugs and vaccines for [[infectious diseases]] of military importance. First formed as the SEATO Lab following the 1956-8 [[Cholera]] pandemic, USAMC-AFRIMS is an agency of the US Embassy Thailand residing at the [[Royal Thai Army Medical Center]] in Bangkok. AFRIMS is a special foreign activity of the [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]] (WRAIR) and part of the [[United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command]] (MRMC). AFRIMS is part of a global network of Department of Defense overseas medical research laboratories located in [[Jakarta]], Indonesia; [[Lima]], Peru; [[Nairobi]], Kenya; and Cairo, Egypt. USAMC-AFRIMS has nearly 300 staff members (Thai and USA) and a research budget of approximately $5–7 million annually.&lt;ref name="United States Foreign Service"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangkok.usembassy.gov/embassy/usamc.html |title=US Army Medical Component of the Armed Forces Research Institute of the Medical Sciences (USAMC-AFRIMS) |work=[[United States Foreign Service]] |accessdate=January 23, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127222904/http://bangkok.usembassy.gov/embassy/usamc.html |archivedate=January 27, 2016 }} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The major infectious disease threats to soldiers in South East Asia include [[drug resistant]] malaria, diarrhea and dysentery, [[dengue fever]], HIV, hepatitis, and [[scrub typhus]]. These agents pose health risks to soldiers as well as to the civilian population, and thus form the major areas of research at AFRIMS. Research is predominantly applied research aimed towards finding, developing and testing new drugs and vaccines. New medications currently under development are for the treatment and prevention of multiple drug resistant malaria. Vaccines for dysentery, dengue fever, hepatitis E and HIV are also under development at AFRIMS. Products originally field tested or developed at AFRIMS include Hepatitis A Vaccine, Japanese B Encephalitis Vaccine, doxycycline prophylaxis for malaria, mefloquine antimalarial drug prevention, and [[halofantrine]] antimalarial drug treatment.&lt;ref name="United States Foreign Service"/&gt;

AFRIMS also conducts surveillance of emerging diseases such as drug resistant P falciparum malaria, Diarrhea agents: Campylobacter, Cholera O139, Cyclospora, E coli, Hepatitis E, HIV 1 E clade, drug resistant scrub typhus, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and influenza. The laboratory has over 30 field sites in Thailand, Nepal, Cambodia, [[Vietnam]] and [[Bangladesh]]. AFRIMS also has the largest medical library in Southeast Asia and a modern research animal facility, which is accredited by the [[Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International]] (AAALAC).&lt;ref name="United States Foreign Service"/&gt;

'''Brewer–Dobson circulation''' is a [[Model (abstract)|model]] of atmospheric circulation, proposed by [[Alan West Brewer|Alan Brewer]] in 1949 and [[Gordon Dobson]] in 1956, which attempts to explain why tropical air has less [[ozone]] than polar air, even though the tropical [[stratosphere]] is where most atmospheric ozone is produced. It is a simple circulation model that posits the existence of a slow [[Air current|current]] in the winter [[Sphere|hemisphere]] which redistributes air from the tropics to the extratropics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2237">A '''canonical unit''' is a [[unit of measurement]] agreed upon as default in a certain context.

== In astrodynamics ==

In [[astrodynamics]], canonical units are defined in terms of an object's reference [[orbit]]. In this system, a reference mass, for example the sun, is assumed to be 1 "mass unit" and the mean distance from the orbiting object to the reference object is considered the "distance unit".

Canonical units are useful when the precise distances and masses of objects in space are not available. However, by setting the mass of a given  object to be 1 mass unit and the mean distance of the reference object to another object in question, many calculations can be simplified.

=== Overview ===

The ''Distance Unit'' &lt;math&gt;DU \ &lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the mean radius of the reference orbit.

The ''Time Unit'' &lt;math&gt;TU \ &lt;/math&gt; is defined by the [[gravitational parameter]] &lt;math&gt; \mu\ &lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\mu = G*M\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;G \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]]
* &lt;math&gt;M \ &lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the central reference body

For canonical units, the gravitational parameter is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;\mu = 1 * \frac{DU^3}{TU^2}&lt;/math&gt;

----

The quantity of the time unit (TU) can be solved in another unit system (e.g. the metric system) if the mass and radius of the central body has been determined. Using the above equation and applying [[dimensional analysis]], set the two equations expressing &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; equal to each other:

&lt;math&gt;\mu = G*M = 1 * \frac{DU^3}{TU^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The time unit (TU) can be converted to another unit system for a more useful qualitative solution using the following equation:

&lt;math&gt; TU = \sqrt{\frac{DU^3}{G*M}}&lt;/math&gt;

For Earth satellites, approximate unit conversions are as follows:
* 1 DU = 6378.1&amp;nbsp;km = 20,925,524.97&amp;nbsp;ft
* 1 DU/TU = 7.90538&amp;nbsp;km/s = 25,936.29&amp;nbsp;ft/sec
* 1 TU = 806.80415&amp;nbsp;s

=== Astronomical Unit ===

The [[astronomical unit]] is a canonical unit based on the orbit of the Earth around the Sun

'''Conditional access''' (abbreviated '''CA''') or '''conditional access system''' (abbreviated '''CAS''') is the protection of content by requiring certain criteria to be met before granting access to the content. The term is commonly used in relation to [[digital television]] systems.

==In Digital Video Broadcasting==
Under the [[Digital Video Broadcasting]] (DVB) standard, conditional access system (CAS) standards are defined in the specification documents for DVB-CA (conditional access), [[Common Scrambling Algorithm|DVB-CSA]] (the common [[Scrambler|scrambling]] algorithm) and [[DVB-CI]] (the [[Common Interface]]). These standards define a method by which one can obfuscate a digital-television stream, with access provided only to those with valid decryption [[smart cards|smart-cards]]. The DVB specifications for conditional access are available from the [http://www.dvb.org/technology/standards/index.xml#conditional standards page on the DVB website].

This is achieved by a combination of [[scrambler|scrambling]] and [[encryption]]. The data stream is scrambled with a 48-bit secret key, called the ''control word''. Knowing the value of the control word at a given moment is of relatively little value, as under normal conditions, content providers will change the control word several times per minute. The control word is generated automatically in such a way that successive values are not usually predictable; the DVB specification recommends using a physical process for that.

In order for the receiver to unscramble the data stream, it must be permanently informed about the current value of the control word. In practice, it must be informed slightly in advance, so that no viewing interruption occurs. [[Encryption]] is used to protect the control word during transmission to the receiver: the control word is encrypted as an ''entitlement control message'' (ECM). The CA subsystem in the receiver will decrypt the control word only when authorised to do so; that authority is sent to the receiver in the form of an ''entitlement management message'' (EMM). The EMMs are specific to each [[subscriber]], as identified by the smart card in his receiver, or to groups of subscribers, and are issued much less frequently than ECMs, usually at monthly intervals. This being apparently not sufficient to prevent unauthorized viewing, [[Télévision Par Satellite|TPS]] has lowered this interval down to about 12 minutes. This can be different for every provider, [[British Sky Broadcasting|BSkyB]] uses a term of 6 weeks. When [[Nagravision|Nagravision 2]] was hacked, [[Digital+]] started sending a new EMM every three days to make unauthorized viewing more cumbersome.

The contents of ECMs and EMMs are not standardized and as such they depend on the conditional access system being used.

The control word can be transmitted through different ECMs at once. This allows the use of several conditional access systems at the same time, a DVB feature called ''simulcrypt'', which saves bandwidth and encourages multiplex operators to cooperate. [http://www.dvb.org/technology/standards/index.xml#conditional DVB Simulcrypt] is widespread in Europe; some channels, like the [[CNN International]] Europe from the [[Hot Bird]] satellites, can use 7 different CA systems in parallel.
 
The decryption cards are read, and sometimes updated with specific access rights, either through a [[conditional-access module]] (CAM), a [[PC card]]-format card reader meeting DVB-CI standards, or through a built-in [[ISO/IEC 7816]] card reader, such as that in the [[Digibox (Sky Digital)|Sky Digibox]].

Several companies provide competing CA systems; ABV, [[VideoGuard]], Irdeto, [[Nagravision]], [[Conax]], [[Viaccess]], [[Cisco]], [[Mediaguard]] (a.k.a. [[Nagra France|SECA]]) are among the most commonly used CA systems.

Due to the common usage of CA in DVB systems, many tools to aid in or even [[Pirate decryption|directly circumvent]] encryption exist. CAM emulators and multiple-format CAMs exist which can either read several card formats or even directly decrypt a compromised encryption scheme. Most multiple format CAMs and all CAMs that directly decrypt a signal are based on [[reverse engineering]] of the CA systems. A large proportion of the systems currently in use for DVB encryption have been opened to full decryption at some point, including Nagravision, Conax, Viaccess, Mediaguard (v1) as well as the first version of VideoGuard.

==Conditional access in North America==
In Canadian and United States [[Cable television in the United States|cable systems]], the standard for conditional access is provided with [[CableCARD]]s whose specification was developed by the cable company consortium [[CableLabs]].

Cable companies in the US are required by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] to support CableCARDs; standards now exist for two way communication (M-card) but satellite television has its own standards. Next generation approaches in the United States eschew such physical cards and employ schemes using downloadable software for conditional access such as [[Downloadable Conditional Access System|DCAS]].

The main appeal of such approaches is that the [[access control]] may be upgraded dynamically in response to security breaches without requiring expensive exchanges of physical [[conditional-access module]]s. Another appeal is that it may be inexpensively incorporated into non-traditional media display devices such as [[Portable media player|portable media players]].

'''''De duodecim abusivis saeculi''''' ("On the Twelve Abuses of the World") is a treatise on social and political morality written by an anonymous [[Ireland|Irish]] author between 630 and 700. During the Middle Ages the work was very popular throughout Europe.

==Background==
The work was first propagated throughout Europe by Irish missionaries in the 8th century. Its authorship was attributed at different times to [[Saint Patrick]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], but mainly [[Cyprian of Carthage|Saint Cyprian of Carthage]] – men of such authority that it explains its acceptance and popularity. It was not until 1909 that [[Siegmund Hellmann]] revealed its Pseudo-Cyprian origins to an anonymous Irish author of the 7th century.

==Duodecim abusivis saeculi==
''De duodecim'' condemns the following twelve abuses:
{| class="wikitable"
!''Abusivis''

|-
|''sapiens sine operibus''
|the wise man without works
|-
|''senex sine religione''
|the old man without religion

|-
|''populus sine lege''
|the people without a law
|}

==Influence==
{{Expand section|date=November 2008}}
Hellmann points out the extensive influence of the work upon Carolingian writings, such as the [[mirrors for princes]], and later political literature.

There is some direct evidence for the text's popularity in tenth-century England. Bishop [[Æthelwold of Winchester]] is known to have donated a copy to the [[Peterborough]] house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&amp;query=S+1448 Sawyer no. 1448]. See Michael Lapidge, "Surviving booklists in Anglo-Saxon England." ''Anglo-Saxon Manuscripts. Basic Readings'', ed. Mary P. Richards. London, 1994. 87–167: 117–9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ælfric of Eynsham]] drew on a version included in [[Abbo of Fleury]]'s ''Collectio canonum'' for his Old English treatise ''De octo vitiis et de duodecim abusivis gradus'', in which the section on the ''rex iniquus'' was translated whole.

The '''''Energiewende''''' ([[German language|German]] for '''[[energy transition]]''') is the planned transition by [[Germany]] to a [[Low-carbon economy|low carbon]], environmentally sound, reliable, and affordable energy supply.&lt;ref name="bmwi-and-bmu-2010"&gt;{{cite book |author1 = Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) |author2 = Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) |title = Energy concept for an environmentally sound, reliable and affordable energy supply |date = 28 September 2010 |publisher = Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) |place = Berlin, Germany |url = http://www.bmwi.de/English/Redaktion/Pdf/energy-concept,property=pdf,bereich=bmwi,sprache=en,rwb=true.pdf |access-date = 2016-05-01 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161006040920/http://www.bmwi.de/English/Redaktion/Pdf/energy-concept%2Cproperty%3Dpdf%2Cbereich%3Dbmwi%2Csprache%3Den%2Crwb%3Dtrue.pdf |archivedate = 6 October 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The term ''Energiewende'' is regularly used in [[English language]] publications without being translated (a [[loanword]]).&lt;ref name="jungjohann-and-morris-2014"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Jungjohann | first1 = Arne | last2 = Morris | first2 = Craig | title = The German coal conundrum | date = June 2014 | publisher = Heinrich Böll Stiftung | location = Washington, DC, USA | url = http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/files/file/German_Coal_Conundrum.pdf | access-date = 2016-10-07 | quote = The term ''Energiewende'' – the country's transition away from nuclear power to renewables with lower energy consumption – is now commonly used in English.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}}
The new system will rely heavily on [[renewable energy]] (particularly [[Wind power|wind]], [[photovoltaics]], and [[hydroelectricity]]), [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], and [[energy demand management]]. 
Most if not all existing [[Fossil-fuel power station#Coal|coal-fired generation]] will need to be retired.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016-a"&gt;{{cite book | editor1 = acatech | editor2 = Lepoldina | editor3 = Akademienunion | year = 2016 | title = Flexibility concepts for the German power supply in 2050: ensuring stability in the age of renewable energies | publisher = acatech — National Academy of Science and Engineering | place = Berlin, Germany | url = http://www.acatech.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Baumstruktur_nach_Website/Acatech/root/de/Publikationen/Kooperationspublikationen/Stellungnahme_Flexibility_concepts.pdf | access-date = 2016-04-28 | isbn = 978-3-8047-3549-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Nuclear power phase-out#Germany|phase-out]] of Germany's fleet of [[nuclear reactor]]s, to be complete by 2022, is a key part of the program.&lt;ref name="bruninx-etal-2013"&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Kenneth | last1 = Bruninx | first2 = Darin | last2 = Madzharov | first3 = Erik | last3 = Delarue | first4 = William | last4 = D'haeseleer | title = Impact of the German nuclear phase-out on Europe's electricity generation — a comprehensive study | journal = Energy Policy | volume = 60 | pages = 251–261 | year = 2013 | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2013.05.026 | url = https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/tme/research/energy_environment/Pdf/wpen2012-15 | access-date = 2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislative support for the ''Energiewende'' was passed in late 2010 and includes [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) reductions of 80–95% by 2050 (relative to 1990) and a [[renewable energy]] target of 60% by 2050.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015-b"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Energy of the Future: Fourth "Energy Transition" Monitoring Report — Summary | date = November 2015 | publisher = Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) | place = Berlin, Germany

The Berlin-based [[Think tank|policy institute]] [[Agora Energiewende]] noted that "while the German approach is not unique worldwide, the speed and scope of the ''Energiewende'' are exceptional".&lt;ref name="agora-2015-a"&gt;{{cite book | author = Agora Energiewende | title = Understanding the Energiewende: FAQ on the ongoing transition of the German power system | year = 2015 | publisher = [[Agora Energiewende]] | place = Berlin, Germany | url = http://www.agora-energiewende.de/fileadmin/Projekte/2015/Understanding_the_EW/Agora_Understanding_the_Energiewende.pdf | access-date = 2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Energiewende'' also seeks a greater transparency in relation to national [[energy policy]] formation.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016-b"&gt;

Germany has made significant progress on its GHG [[emissions reduction]] target, achieving a 27% decrease between 1990 and 2014. 
However the country will need to maintain an average GHG emissions abatement rate of 3.5% per year to reach its ''Energiewende'' goal, equal to the maximum historical value thus far.&lt;ref name="hillebrandt-etal-2015"&gt;

As of 2013, Germany spends €1.5{{nbsp}}billion per year on energy research in an effort to solve the technical and social issues raised by the transition.&lt;ref name="schiermeier-2013"&gt;{{cite news | first = Quirin | last = Schiermeier | title = Renewable power: Germany's energy gamble: an ambitious plan to slash greenhouse-gas emissions must clear some high technical and economic hurdles | date = 10 April 2013 | work = Nature

[[File:Biogas Photovoltaik Wind.jpg|thumb|The main renewable energy sources in Germany: [[biomass]], [[wind energy]], and [[photovoltaics]]]]

The term ''Energiewende'' was first contained in the title of a 1980 publication by the German [[Öko-Institut]], calling for the complete abandonment of nuclear and petroleum energy.&lt;ref name="krause-etal-1980"&gt;

}} In support of the claim that Krause et al (1980) was the first use of the term ''Energiewende''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|223}}
The most groundbreaking claim was that economic growth was possible without increased energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;https://book.energytransition.org/origin-term-energiewende&lt;/ref&gt;  On 16{{nbsp}}February 1980, the German Federal Ministry of the Environment also hosted a symposium in Berlin, called ''Energiewende – Atomausstieg und Klimaschutz'' (Energy Transition: Nuclear Phase-Out and Climate Protection).  The Institute for Applied Ecology was funded by both environmental and religious organizations, and the importance of religious and conservative figures like Wolf von Fabeck and Peter Ahmels was crucial.  In the following decades, the term ''Energiewende'' expanded in scope – in its present form it dates back to at least 2002.

''Energiewende'' designates a significant change in [[energy policy]].  The term encompasses a reorientation of policy from demand to supply and a shift from centralized to distributed generation (for example, producing heat and power in small cogeneration units), which should replace overproduction and avoidable energy consumption with energy-saving measures and increased efficiency.

In a broader sense, this transition also entails a [[democratization]] of energy.&lt;ref name="paulitz"&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the traditional energy industry, a few large companies with large centralized power stations dominate the market as an oligopoly and consequently amass a worrisome level of both economic and political power. Renewable energies, in contrast, can, as a rule, be established in a decentralized manner.  Public wind farms and solar parks can involve many citizens directly in energy production.&lt;ref name="dnr-2011"&gt;
{{cite web
 | title = Mit Bürgerengagement zur Energiewende
 | trans-title = With citizen involvement for the Energiewende

 | access-date = 2016-06-14
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Photovoltaic systems can even be set up by individuals.  Municipal utilities can also benefit citizens financially, while the conventional energy industry profits a relatively small number of shareholders.  Also significant, the decentralized structure of renewable energies enables creation of value locally and minimizes capital outflows from a region.  Renewable energy sources therefore play an increasingly important role in municipal energy policy, and local governments often promote them.

== Status ==

The key policy document outlining the ''Energiewende'' was published by the German government in September 2010, some six months before the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima nuclear accident]].&lt;ref name="bmwi-and-bmu-2010"/&gt;  Legislative support was passed in September 2010.  On 6 June 2011, following Fukushima, the government removed the use of nuclear power as a bridging technology as part of their policy.&lt;ref name="bmu-2011"&gt;

After the 2013 federal elections, the new [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] coalition government continued the ''Energiewende'', with only minor modification of its goals in the coalition agreement.  An intermediate target was introduced of a 55–60% share of renewable energy in gross electricity consumption in 2035.&lt;ref name="german-energy-blog-2013"&gt;

In addition, there will be an associated [[research and development]] drive.  A chart showing German energy [[legislation]] in 2016 is available.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2016a"&gt;{{cite book

These targets go well beyond [[European Union]] legislation and the national policies of other European states.  The policy objectives have been embraced by the German federal government and has resulted in a huge expansion of renewables, particularly wind power. Germany's share of renewables has increased from around 5% in 1999 to 22.9% in 2012, surpassing the OECD average of 18% usage of renewables.&lt;ref name="economist-2012"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Producers have been guaranteed a fixed [[feed-in tariff]] for 20 years, guaranteeing a fixed income. Energy co-operatives have been created, and efforts were made to decentralize control and profits.  The large energy companies have a disproportionately small share of the renewables market.  However, in some cases poor investment designs have caused bankruptcies and low [[Return on investment|returns]], and unrealistic promises have been shown to be far from reality.&lt;ref name="latsch-etal-2014"&gt;

Nuclear power plants were closed, and the existing nine plants will close earlier than planned, in 2022.

One factor that has inhibited efficient employment of new renewable energy has been the lack of an accompanying investment in power infrastructure to bring the power to market. It is believed 8,300&amp;nbsp;km of power lines must be built or upgraded.&lt;ref name="economist-2012"/&gt;  The different [[States of Germany|German States]] have varying attitudes to the construction of new power lines. Industry has had their rates frozen and so the increased costs of the ''Energiewende'' have been passed on to consumers, who have had rising electricity bills. Germans in 2013 had some of the highest electricity [[price]]s (including taxes) in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;

According to a 2014 survey conducted by TNS Emnid for the German Renewable Energies Agency among 1015 respondents, 94 per cent of the Germans support the enforced expansion of Renewable Energies.

On 1 August 2014, a revised [[German Renewable Energy Sources Act|Renewable Energy Sources Act]] entered into force.  Specific deployment corridors now stipulate the extent to which renewable energy is to be expanded in the future and the funding rates ([[feed-in tariff]]s) will no longer be fixed by the government, but will be determined by auction.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015-a"/&gt;

Among other things, wind and PV cannot be principally refinanced under the current [[marginal cost]] based market.  Carbon pricing is also central to the ''Energiewende'' and the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS) needs to be reformed to create a genuine [[scarcity]] of certificates.&lt;ref name="agora-2015-b"&gt;

Most of the computer scenarios used to analyse the ''Energiewende'' rely on a substantial carbon price to drive the transition to low-carbon technologies.

Coal-fired generation needs to be retired as part of the ''Energiewende''.  Some argue for an explicit negotiated phase-out of coal plants, along the lines of the well-publicized nuclear phase-out.&lt;ref name="agora-2016a"&gt;

Coal comprised 42% of electricity generation in 2015.  If Germany is to limit its contribution to a [[Global Warming|global temperature increase]] to 1.5{{nbsp}}°C above pre-industrial levels, as declared in the 2015 [[Paris Agreement]], a complete phase-out of fossil fuels together with a shift to [[100% renewable energy]] is required by about 2040.&lt;ref name="quaschning-2016"&gt;

The areas covered are the energy efficiency of buildings, energy conservation for companies, consumer energy efficiency, and transport energy efficiency.  German industry is expected to make a sizeable contribution.

An official federal government report on progress under the ''Energiewende'', updated for 2014, notes that:&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015-b"/&gt;

* energy consumption fell by 4.7% in 2014 (from 2013) and at {{val|13132}}{{nbsp}}petajoules reached it lowest level since 1990
* renewable generation is the number-one source of electricity
* energy efficiency increased by an average annual 1.6% between 2008 and 2014
* final energy consumption in the transport sector was 1.7% higher in 2014 than in 2005

Analysis by Agora Energiewende in late-2016 suggests that Germany will probably miss several of its key ''Energiewende'' targets, despite recent reforms to the [[German Renewable Energy Sources Act|Renewable Energy Sources Act]] and the wholesale electricity market.  The goal to cut emissions by 40% by 2020 "will most likely be missed{{nbsp}}... if no further measures are taken" and the 55–60% share of renewable energy in gross electricity consumption by 2035 is "unachievable" with the current plans for renewables expansion.&lt;ref name="clew-2016a"&gt;

The plan states that the energy supply must be "almost completely decarbonised" by 2050, with renewables as its main source.  For the electricity sector, "in the long-term, electricity generation must be based almost entirely on renewable energies" and "the share of wind and solar power in total electricity production will rise significantly".

The fifth monitoring report on the ''Energiewende'' for 2015 was published in December 2016.  The expert commission which wrote the report warns that Germany will probably miss its 2020 climate targets and believes that this could threaten the credibility of the entire endeavor.  The commission puts forward a number of measures to address the slowdown, including a flat national {{CO2}} price imposed across all sectors, a greater focus on transport, and full market exposure for renewable generation.  Regarding the carbon price, the commission thinks that a reformed [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|EU{{nbsp}}ETS]] would be better, but that achieving agreement across Europe is unlikely.&lt;ref name="egenter-and-wehrmann-2016"&gt;

== Citizen support and participation ==

{{as of|2016}}, citizen support for the ''Energiewende'' remains high, with recent surveys indicating that about 80–90% of the public are in favor.&lt;ref name="amelang-and-wettengel-2016"&gt;{{cite news | first1 = Sören | last1 = Amelang | first2 = Julian | last2 = Wettengel	 | title = Polls reveal citizens' support for Energiewende | date = 4 May 2016 | website = Clean Energy Wire (CLEW) | location = Berlin, Germany | url = https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/polls-reveal-citizens-support-energiewende | access-date = 2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
One reason for the high acceptance is the substantial participation of German citizens in the ''Energiewende'', as private households, land owners, or members of energy cooperatives (''Genossenschaft'').&lt;ref name="borchert-2015"&gt;{{cite news | first = Lars | last = Borchert	 | title = Germany between citizens' energy and Nimbyism | date = 10 March 2015 | website = Clean Energy Wire (CLEW) | location = Berlin, Germany | url = https://www.cleanenergywire.org/dossiers/peoples-energiewende | access-date = 2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer studies ==

Much of the policy development for the ''Energiewende'' is underpinned by [[computer simulation|computer models]], run mostly by universities and research institutes.  The models are usually based on [[scenario analysis]] and are used to investigate different assumptions regarding the stability, sustainability, cost, efficiency, and public acceptability of various sets of technologies.  Some models cover the entire [[energy sector]], while others are confined to [[electricity generation]] and consumption.  A 2016 book investigates the usefulness and limitations of energy scenarios and energy models within the context of the ''Energiewende''.&lt;ref name="dieckhoff-and-leuschner-2016"&gt;&lt;!-- publishers url: www.transcript-verlag.de/978-3-8376-3171-5 --&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of computer studies confirm the feasibility of the German electricity system being 100% renewable in 2050.  Some investigate the prospect of the entire energy system (all energy carriers) being fully renewable too.

=== 2009 WWF study ===

In 2009 [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] Germany published a quantitative study prepared by the [[Öko-Institut]], Prognos, and Hans-Joachim Ziesing.&lt;ref name="wwf-germany-2009"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The study presumes a 95% reduction in [[greenhouse gas]]es by the year 2050 and covers all sectors.  The study shows that the transformation from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy is possible and  affordable.  It notes that by committing to this transformation  path, Germany could become a model for other countries.

=== 2011 German Advisory Council on the Environment study ===

A 2011 report from the [[:de:Sachverständigenrat für Umweltfragen|German Advisory Council on the Environment]] (SRU) concludes that Germany can attain 100% renewable electricity generation by 2050.&lt;ref name="sru-2010"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR) REMix high-resolution energy model was used for the analysis.  A range of scenarios were investigated and a cost-competitive transition with good security of supply is possible.

The authors presume that the transmission network will continue to be reinforced and that cooperation with Norway and Sweden would allow their hydro generation to be utilized for storage.  The transition does not require Germany's [[Nuclear power phase-out#Germany|nuclear phase-out]] (''{{lang|de|Atomausstieg}}'') to be extended nor the construction of coal-fired plants with [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS).  Conventional generation assets need not be stranded and an orderly transition should prevail.  Stringent energy efficiency and energy saving programs can bring down the future costs of electricity.

=== 2015 Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project study ===

The [[Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project]] (DDPP) aims to demonstrate how countries can transform their energy systems by 2050 in order to achieve a [[low-carbon economy]].
The 2015 German country report, produced in association with the [[Wuppertal Institute]], examines the official target of reducing domestic GHG emissions by 80% to 95% by 2050 (compared with 1990).&lt;ref name="hillebrandt-2015"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Decarbonization  pathways  for  Germany  are  illustrated  by  means  of  three  ambitious scenarios with energy-related emission reductions between 1990 and 2050 varying between 80%  and  more  than  90%.  Three strategies strongly contribute to GHG emission reduction: 
* energy efficiency improvements (in all sectors but especially in buildings)
* increased use of domestic renewables (with a focus on electricity generation)
* electrification  and  (in  two  of  the  scenarios  also)  use  of  renewable  electricity-based synthetic fuels (especially in the transport and industry sector)
In addition, some scenarios use controversially:
* final energy demand reductions through behavioral changes ([[mode of transport|modal shift]] in transport, changes in eating and heating habits)
* net imports of electricity from renewable sources or of [[bioenergy]]
* use of [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS) technology to reduce industry sector GHG emissions (including cement production)
Potential co-benefits for Germany include increased energy security, higher competitiveness of and global business opportunities for companies, job creation, stronger GDP growth, smaller energy bills for households, and less air pollution.

&lt;/ref&gt;  The guiding question of the study is: how can a cost-optimised transformation of the German energy system — with consideration of all [[energy carrier]]s and consumer sectors — be achieved while meeting the declared [[climate protection]] targets and ensuring a secure energy supply at all times.  [[Carbon capture and storage]] (CCS) is explicitly excluded from the scenarios.  A future energy scenario emitting 85% less CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions than 1990 levels is compared with a reference scenario, which assumes that the German energy system operates in 2050 the same way as it does today.  Under this comparison, primary energy supply drops 42%.  The total cumulative costs depend on the future prices for carbon and oil.  If the penalty for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions increases to €100/tonne by 2030 and thereafter remains constant and fossil fuel prices increase annually by 2%, then the total cumulative costs of today's energy system are 8% higher than the costs required for the minus 85% scenario up to 2050.  The report also notes:

{{quote|From the macroeconomic perspective, the transformation of Germany's energy system demands a significant shift in cash flow, moving the cash spent on energy imports today to spend it instead on new investments in systems, their operation and maintenance.  In this respect a transformed energy system requires a large expenditure for local added value, a factor which also does not appear in the shown cost analysis.&lt;ref name="henning-and-palzer-2015"/&gt;{{rp|8}}}}

=== 2015 DIW study ===

A 2015 study uses DIETER or Dispatch and Investment Evaluation Tool with Endogenous Renewables, developed by the [[German Institute for Economic Research]] (DIW), Berlin, Germany.  The study examines the power storage requirements for renewables uptake ranging from 60% to 100%.  Under the baseline scenario of 80% (the German government target for 2050), [[Grid energy storage|grid storage]] requirements remain moderate and other options on both the supply side and demand side offer flexibility at low cost.  Nonetheless storage plays an important role in the provision of reserves.  Storage becomes more pronounced under higher shares of renewables, but strongly depends on the costs and availability of other flexibility options, particularly on biomass availability.  The model is fully described in the study report.&lt;ref name="zerrahn-and-schill-2015"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Set in 2050, several scenarios use [[gas turbine#industrial gas turbines for power generation|gas power plants]] to stabilise the backbone of energy system, ensuring supply security during several weeks of low wind and solar radiation.  Other scenarios investigate a 100% renewable system and show these to be possible but more costly.  Flexible consumption and storage control ([[energy demand management|demand-side management]]) in households and the industrial sector is the most cost-efficient means of balancing short-term power fluctuations.  Long-term storage systems, based on [[power-to-X]], are only viable if carbon emissions are to be reduced by more than 80%.  On the question of costs, the study notes:

{{quote|Assuming that the price of emissions allowances in 2050 will significantly surpass its current level, a power generation system boasting a high percentage of wind and photovoltaics will, as a rule, come  cheaper  than  a  system  dominated by fossil fuel power plants.&lt;ref name="acatech-2016"/&gt;{{rp|7}}}}

Using biomass as a fuel produces [[air pollution]] in the form of [[carbon monoxide]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[NOx]] (nitrogen oxides), VOCs ([[volatile organic compound]]s), particulates and other pollutants. However, since the beginning of the Energiewende the balance of biomass vs other forms of renewable energy has shifted; biomass made up 7.0% of Germany's power generation mix in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://energytransition.org/2018/01/german-energy-consumption-2017/|title=Germany’s energy consumption in 2017|date=2018-01-11|work=Energy Transition|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Biomass has the potential to be a [[carbon-neutral]] fuel because growing biomass absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and a portion of the carbon absorbed remains in the ground after harvest.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41603.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Biomass contains less sulfur than coal and so produces much less sulfur dioxide than coal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pfpi.net/air-pollution-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://michiganmessenger.com/33868/proposed-biomass-plant-better-than-coal|title=Proposed biomass plant: Better than coal?|author=Eartha Jane Melzer|date=January 26, 2010|work=The Michigan Messenger|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205080916/http://michiganmessenger.com/33868/proposed-biomass-plant-better-than-coal|archivedate=2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21449">'''Engineering management''' is the application of the practice of [[management]] to the practice of [[engineering]].

Engineering management is a career that brings together the technological problem-solving ability of [[engineering]] and the organizational, administrative, and planning abilities of [[management]] in order to oversee the operational performance of complex engineering driven enterprises. A [[Master of Engineering Management]] (MEM) is sometimes compared to a [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) for professionals seeking a graduate degree as a qualifying credential for a career in engineering management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gordon.tufts.edu/programs/m-s-in-engineering-management/msem-vs-mba|title=MSEM vs. MBA - Gordon Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Stevens Institute of Technology]] is believed to have the oldest engineering management department, established as the School of Business Engineering in 1908. This was later called the Bachelor of Engineering in Engineering Management (BEEM) program and moved into the School of Systems and Enterprises. Drexel University established the first graduate engineering management degree in the U.S., which was first offered in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drexel.edu/egmt/about/history/|title=History - Engineering Management|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 the first university department explicitly titled "Engineering Management" was founded at the [[Missouri University of Science and Technology]] (Missouri S&amp;T, formerly the University of Missouri-Rolla, formerly Missouri School of Mines). In 1959, [[Western Michigan University]] began offering the predecessor to the modern engineering management bachelor's degree (titled "Industrial Supervision") and in 1977, WMU started its MS degree in Manufacturing Administration, later renamed as Engineering Management. 

Outside the USA, in Germany the first department concentrating on Engineering Management was established 1927 in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vwi.org/hauptmenue/beruf-studium/wirtschaftsingenieurwesen/geschichte-und-bedeutung.html|title=Geschichte und Bedeutung - vwi.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Turkey the [[Istanbul Technical University]] has a Management Engineering Department established in 1982, offering a number of graduate and undergraduate programs in Management Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.end.itu.edu.tr/tarihce.html&lt;/ref&gt; In UK the [[University of Warwick]] has a specialised department [[Warwick Manufacturing Group|WMG]] (previously known as [[Warwick Manufacturing Group]]) established in 1980, which offers a graduate programme in MSc Engineering Business Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/education/wmgmasters/courses/masters_engineering_business_management|title=MSc Engineering Business Management - University of Warwick|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michigan Technological University]] began an Engineering Management program in the School of Business &amp; Economics in the Fall of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtu.edu/registrar/students/major-degree/audit/business/|title=School of Business Audit Forms - The Registrar's Office|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] has started a complete master's degree Program in Engineering Management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engr.mun.ca/graduate/course/mem.php Master of Engineering Management]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Denmark, the [[Technical University of Denmark]] offers a MSc program in Engineering Management (in English).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtu.dk/english/Education/msc/Programmes/engineering_management MSc in Engineering Management].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Pakistan, [[University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila]], [[University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore]] and [[National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan|National University of Science and Technology]] (NUST) offer admission both at Master and Doctorate level in Engineering Management while [[Capital University of Science &amp; Technology]] (CUST), NED University of Engineering &amp; Technology, Karachi and Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology have been running a Master of Engineering/MS in Engineering Management program. A variant of this program is within Quality Management. COMSATS (CIIT) offers a MSc Project Management program to Local and Overseas Pakistanis as an on-campus/off-campus student.

In Italy, [[Politecnico di Milano]] offers degrees in Management Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dig.polimi.it/index.php?id=37&amp;L=2|title=Studies in Management, Economics and Industrial Engineering|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia, since 2014 the Faculty of Engineering Management of The [[Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration]] (RANEPA) offers bachelor and master degrees in Engineering Management.

In France, the  [http://www.epf.fr/en EPF] will offer, from January 2018, a 2 year Engineering &amp; Management major in English for the 4th and 5th years of its 5 year Engineering Master’s degree.  The final 2 years are open to students who have completed an undergraduate engineering degree elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epf.fr/en/studies/majors/engineering-management-major-paris-campus EPF:Engineering Management Paris Campus]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas==

=== Operations management, operations research, and supply chain management ===
[[Operations management]] is concerned with designing and controlling the process of production and redesigning business operations in the production of goods or services. [[Operations research]] deals with quantitative models of complex operations and uses these models to support [[decision-making]] in any sector of industry or public services. [[Supply chain management]] is the process of planning, implementing and managing the flow of goods, services and related information from the point of origin to the point of consumption.&lt;ref name="UWMGTE"&gt;[http://www.mansci.uwaterloo.ca/mgte/index.php University of Waterloo], Management Engineering.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Management of technology ===
The [[Technology management|Management of Technology]] (MOT) theme builds on the foundation of management topics in [[accounting]], [[finance]], [[economics]], [[organizational behavior]] and organizational design. Courses in this theme deal with operational and organizational issues related to managing [[innovation]] and technological change.&lt;ref name="UWMGTE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gordon.tufts.edu/programs/m-s-in-engineering-management/program-structure|title=Program Structure - Gordon Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New product development and product engineering ===
[[New product development]] (NPD) is the complete process of bringing a new product to market. [[Product engineering]] refers to the process of designing and developing a device, assembly, or system such that it be produced as an item for sale through some production manufacturing process. Product engineering usually entails activity dealing with issues of cost, producibility, quality, performance, reliability, serviceability, intended lifespan and user features. [[Project Management]] techniques are used to manage the design and development progress using the [[phase-gate model]] in the product development process. [[Design for manufacturability]] (also sometimes known as design for manufacturing or DFM) is the general engineering art of designing products in such a way that they are easy to manufacture.

=== Systems engineering ===
[[Systems engineering]] is an interdisciplinary field of engineering and engineering management that focuses on how to design and manage complex systems over their life cycles.

=== Industrial engineering ===
[[Industrial engineering]] is a branch of engineering which deals with the optimization of complex processes, systems or organizations. Industrial engineers work to eliminate waste of time, money, materials, man-hours, machine time, energy and other resources that do not generate value.

=== Management science ===
[[Management science]] uses various scientific research-based principles, strategies, and analytical methods including [[mathematical modeling]], statistics and numerical algorithms to improve an organization's ability to enact rational and meaningful management decisions by arriving at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision problems

==Education==
Engineering management programs typically include instruction in [[accounting]], [[economics]], [[finance]], [[project management]], [[systems engineering]], [[industrial engineering]], [[mathematical model]]ing and optimization, [[management information systems]], [[quality control]] &amp; [[six sigma]], [[operations management]], [[operations research]], [[human resources management]], industrial [[psychology]], [[safety]] and [[health]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/cip2000/occupationallookup6d.ASP?CIP=15.1501 U.S. Department of Education Institute of Education Sciences: Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP)] - Retrieved on October 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://atmae.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=227&amp;Itemid=48 ATMAE Membership Venn Diagram] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113190247/http://atmae.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=227&amp;Itemid=48 |date=2013-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many options for entering into engineering management, albeit that the foundation requirement is an [[engineering degree]] (or other [[computer science]], [[mathematics]] or [[science]] degree) and a [[business degree]].

'''Undergraduate degrees'''

Although most engineering management programs are geared for graduate studies, there are a few elite institutions that teach EM at the undergraduate level.  Some of the ones that are accredited and/or recognized by ASEM include: West Point ([[United States Military Academy]]), [[Norwich University]], [[Western Michigan University]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wmich.edu/edmms/academics/undergraduate/engmanagementtech&lt;/ref&gt; (ABET-accredited by ETAC of ABET), [[New York Institute of Technology]], [[Stevens Institute of Technology]], [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], [[George Washington University]], [[Arizona State University]], [[Missouri University of Science and Technology]]. Graduates of these programs regularly command nearly $65,000 their first year out of school.&lt;ref name="Stevens Institue of Technology"&gt;{{cite web|title=Accepted Salary Offers |url=http://www.stevens.edu/sit/admissions/careers/2010-Career-Outcomes.cfm |work=Class of 2010 Career Outcomes |accessdate=18 May 2011 |author=Stevens Institute of Technology |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409114519/http://www.stevens.edu/sit/admissions/careers/2010-Career-Outcomes.cfm |archivedate=9 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the USA, [[Istanbul Technical University]] Management Engineering Department offers an undergraduate degree in Management Engineering,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isl.itu.edu.tr/isletmeLisansProgramlarEN.htm&lt;/ref&gt; attracting top students. The [[University of Waterloo]] offers a 4-year undergraduate degree (5 years including co-op education) in the field of Management Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mansci.uwaterloo.ca/mgte/index.php Management Engineering]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first program of its kind in Canada. In Peru, Pacifico University offers a five-year undergraduate degree in this field, the first program in this country. In Germany, [[ESB Business School]]&lt;ref&gt;[[ESB Business School]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}} offers a 4-year undergraduate program which consists of five semesters at [[ESB Business School]], two mandatory internships, one is mandatory to be in another country than Germany, and also one mandatory semester abroad. In the annual applied university ranking of the magazine [[Wirtschaftswoche]], the [[Engineering Management]] course of [[ESB Business School]] is ranked on place five of all applied universities in Germany&lt;ref&gt;https://www.esb-business-school.de/fakultaet/aktuelles/detail/artikel/bwl-absolventen-der-esb-auf-platz-eins/&lt;/ref&gt;. The magazine surveyed more than 500 recruiters in the German industry from which university they are most likely to recruit students and which universities satisfy their needs regarding experience in working with projects, multilingual education, and ability to communicate most.

'''Graduate degrees'''
{{main|Master of Engineering Management}}
Many universities offer Master of Engineering Management degrees. Missouri S&amp;T is credited with awarding the first Ph.D. in Engineering Management in 1984. The [[National Institute of Industrial Engineering]] based in [[Mumbai]] has been awarding degrees in the field of Post Graduate Diploma in Industrial Engineering since 1973 and the Fellowship (Doctoral) degrees have been awarded since 2008. 

[[Western Michigan University]] began offering the MS in Manufacturing Administration degree in 1977 and later renamed the degree as Master of Science in Engineering Management&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wmich.edu/ieeem/academics/masters&lt;/ref&gt;. WMU's MSEM alumni work in the automotive, medical, manufacturing, and service sectors, often in roles of project manager, engineering manager, and senior leadership in engineering and technical organizations.

Cornell University started one of the first Engineering Management Masters programs in 1988 with the launch of their Master of Engineering (M.Eng.) in Engineering Management. The program allows students access to courses and programs in the College of Engineering, Johnson School of Management, and across Cornell University more broadly. 

Netaji Subhas Institute of technology (NSIT, website as http://www.nsit.ac.in/ under University of Delhi)New Delhi also provides M.tech degree in Engineering management.Admission to this program happens through GATE(Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering)examination.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology offers a Master in System Design and Management, which is a member of the Consortium of Engineering Management.

Students in the University of Kansas' Engineering Management Program are practicing professionals employed by over 100 businesses, manufacturing, government or consulting firms. There are over 200 actively enrolled students in the program and approximately 500 alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emgt.ku.edu/key-aspects|title=Key Aspects - Engineering Management|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Istanbul Technical University]] Management Engineering Department offers a graduate degree,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isl.itu.edu.tr/isletmeYuksekLisansProgramlarEN.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and a Ph.D. in Management Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isl.itu.edu.tr/isletmeDoktoraProgramlarEN.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[American Society for Engineering Education]] (ASEE) PRISM Magazine (March 2008) the largest Master's of Engineering Management (MEM) programs (in terms of degrees awarded for 2005–2006) are shown in the following chart.

==Management engineering consulting==
Large and small engineering driven firms often require the expertise of external [[management consultant]]s that specialize in companies where engineering practice and product development are key drivers of value.  Most engineering management consultants will have as a minimum a [[professional engineering]] qualification.  But usually they will also have graduate degrees in engineering and or business or a [[management consulting]] designation.  It involves providing [[management consulting]] service that is specific to professional [[engineering]] practice or to the engineering industry sector.  Engineering management consultancies, are typically boutique firms and have a more specialized focus than the traditional mainstream consulting firms, [[A T Kearney]], [[Boston Consulting Group]], [[KPMG]], [[PWC]], and [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]]. [[Applied science]] and [[engineering]] practice requires a holistic approach involving a combination of management art, science, and engineering practice. There are many professional service companies delivering services in a consultancy type relationship to the engineering industry, including [[law]], [[accounting]], [[human resources]], [[marketing]], [[politics]], [[economics]], [[finance]], [[Public administration|public affairs]], and [[communication]].  Commonly, engineering management consultants are used when firms require a combination of special [[Technology|technical]] knowledge, and [[management]] know how, to enhance [[knowledge]] or transform organizational performance and also keep any [[intellectual property]] developed confidential.

Engineering management consulting is concerned with the development, improvement, implementation and evaluation of integrated systems of organizations, people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy, materials and/or processes.  Management Engineering Consultants strive to improve upon existing organizations, processes, products or systems. Engineering management consulting draws upon the principles and methods of engineering analysis and synthesis, as well as the mathematical, physical and [[social sciences]] together with the principles and methods of engineering design to specify, predict, and evaluate the results to be obtained from such systems or processes. Engineering management consulting can focus on the social impact of the product, process or system that is being analyzed.  There is also an overlap between engineering management consulting and [[management science]] in services that require the adoption of more analytical approaches to problem solving.

Examples of where engineering management consulting might be used include developing and leading a company wide [[business transformation]] initiative, or designing and implementing a [[new product development]] process, designing and implementing a [[manufacturing engineering]] process, including an automated assembly workstation.  Management engineers may specialize in the acquisition and implementation of [[Computer aided design]] (CAD), [[Computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) and [[Computer-aided engineering]] (CAE) applications.  Services may include strategizing for various operational logistics, new product introductions, or consulting as an efficiency expert.  It may include using [[management science]] techniques to develop a new financial algorithm or loan system for a bank, streamlining operation and emergency room location or usage in a hospital, planning complex distribution schemes for materials or products (referred to as [[Supply Chain Management]]), and shortening lines (or [[queueing theory|queues]]) at a bank, hospital, or a theme park.  Management engineering consultants typically use [[computer simulation]] (especially [[discrete event simulation]]), along with extensive mathematical tools and modeling and computational methods for system analysis, evaluation, and optimization.

==Professional organizations==
There are a number of societies and organizations dedicated to the field of engineering management. One of the largest societies is a division of IEEE, the Engineering Management Society, which regularly publishes a trade magazine. Another prominent professional organization in the field is the American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM), which was founded in 1979 by a group of 20 engineering managers from industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asem.org|title=American Society for Engineering Management - Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ASEM currently certifies engineering managers (two levels) via the Associate Engineering Manager (AEM) or Professional Engineering Manager (PEM) certification exam. The Master of Engineering Management Programs Consortium is a newly formed consortium of prominent universities intended to raise the value and visibility of the MEM degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mempc.org Master of Engineering Management Programs Consortium ]&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, engineering management university programs have the possibility of being accredited by [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology|ABET]], [[Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering|ATMAE]], or ASEM. In Canada, the Canadian Society for Engineering Management (CSEM) is a constituent society of the Engineering Institute of Canada (EIC), Canada's oldest learned engineering society.

The '''''Etymologicum Genuinum''''' (standard abbreviation '''''E Gen''''') is the conventional modern title given to a [[Lexicography|lexical]] [[encyclopedia]] compiled at [[Constantinople]] in the mid ninth century. The anonymous compiler drew on the works of numerous earlier lexicographers and [[scholiasts]], both ancient and recent, including [[Aelius Herodianus]], [[Georgius Choeroboscus]], [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Methodius]], [[Orion of Thebes]], [[Oros of Alexandria]] and  [[Theognostus the Grammarian]].&lt;ref&gt;Reitzenstein (1897) 1-69; Alpers (1969) 3-24; Alpers (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Etymologicum Genuinum'' was possibly a product of the intellectual circle around [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]]. It was an important source for the subsequent Byzantine lexicographical tradition, including the ''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]'', ''[[Etymologicum Gudianum]]'' and ''[[Etymologicum Symeonis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Berger (1972); Rance (2007) 201-206&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholarship discovered the ''Etymologicum Genuinum'' only in the nineteenth century. It is preserved in two tenth-century [[manuscripts]], ''Codex Vaticanus Graecus'' 1818 (= A) and ''Codex Laurentianus Sancti Marci'' 304 (= B; AD 994). Neither contains the earliest [[recension]] nor the complete text, but rather two different abridgements. The manuscript evidence and citations in later works suggest that the original title was simply τὸ Ἐτυμολογικόν and later τὸ μέγα Ἐτυμολογικόν. Its modern name was coined in 1897 by [[Richard Reitzenstein]], who was the first to edit a sample section.&lt;ref&gt;Reitzenstein (1897) 11-44&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Etymologicum Genuinum'' remains for the most part unpublished except for specimen glosses.&lt;ref&gt;Colonna (1967); Alpers (1969); Berger (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; Two editions are in long-term preparation, one begun by [[Ada Adler]] and continued by [[Klaus Alpers]],&lt;ref&gt;Alpers (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; the other by [[François Lasserre]] and [[Nikolaos Livadaras]].&lt;ref&gt;Lasserre and Livadaras (1976- )&lt;/ref&gt; The latter edition is published under the title ''Etymologicum Magnum Genuinum'', but this designation is not widely used and is a potential source of confusion with the twelfth-century lexical compendium conventionally titled the ''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;E.

}}'''Five Themes of Geography''' is an educational tool for teaching [[geography]]. Adopted in 1984 by the [[Association of American Geographers]], those five themes were published in the NCGE/AAG publication ''Guidelines for Geographic Education, Elementary, and Secondary Schools''. Most American geography and [[social studies]] [[classroom]]s have adopted the five themes in teaching practices.&lt;ref name="LessonPlanet"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lessonplanet.com/article/elementary-math/geography-lesson-plans-using-google-earth |title=Geography Lesson Plans Using Google Earth |first=Karen |last=Ganzel |accessdate=April 28, 2010 |publisher=Lesson Planet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==

The five-theme organizational approach was superseded by the Geography for Life standards published by the National Geographic Society United States Of America, a set of eighteen standards promulgated in 1994. However, the five themes continue to be used as an educational approach in many educational outlets.&lt;ref name="LessonPlanet"/&gt;

'''Five Themes''':&lt;ref name="5Themes"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://geography.about.com/od/teachgeography/a/5themes.htm |title=The Five Themes of Geography |first=Matt |last=Rosenberg |accessdate=November 16, 2013 |publisher=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Location (geography)|Location]]
* [[Place (geography)|Place]]
* [[Human-Environment Interaction]]
* [[Movement (geography)|Movement]] 
* [[Region]]

===Location=== 
Every point on Earth has a location. Location can be described in two different ways:
* ''Absolute location'', a location as described by its latitude and longitude on the [[Earth]]. For example, the coordinates of [[Albany, New York]] are 42.6525° N, 73.7572° W.
* ''Relative location'', a location as described by where it is compared to something else. For example, [[Albany, New York]] is roughly 140 miles north of New York City.

===Place===
A place is an area that is defined by everything in it. All places have features that give them personality and distinguish them from other places

* Toponym: a place name, especially one derived from a topographical feature.
* Site: an area of ground on which a town, building, or monument is constructed.
* Situation: the location and surroundings of a place.
* Population: the number of people that live in the area.

=== Human-environment interaction ===
{{see|human-environment interaction}}
This theme describes how people interact with the environment, and how the environment responds, with three key concepts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.csustan.edu/sites/default/files/TeacherEd/FacultyStaff/betts/Handouts/PDFs/Five%20Themes%20of%20Geography.pdf | title=The Five Themes of Geography | accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Dependency: Humans depend on the environment.
*[[Adaptation]]: Humans adapt to the environment.
*Modification: Humans modify the environment.

=== Movement ===
Movement is the [[travel]] of [[people]], [[Good (economics and accounting)|good]]s, and [[idea]]s from one location to another, or political events. Examples of movement include the [[United States]]' [[westward expansion]], the [[Information Revolution]], and [[immigration]]. New devices such as the [[airplane]] and the [[Internet]] allow physical and ideological goods to be transferred long distances in short time intervals. A person's travel from place to place, and the actions they perform there are also considered movement.


Example: Buses, Airplanes, Cars, and Boats.

=== Region ===
Regions are areas with distinctive characteristics: human characteristics, such as demographics or politics, and physical characteristics, such as climate and vegetation. For example, the US is a political region because it shares one governmental system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8479">'''Green tree reservoirs''' ('''GTR'''s) consist of [[bottomland hardwood forest]] land which is shallowly flooded in the fall and winter.

Prior to modern industrialization and commercial farming, the Southeastern United States was home to more than 10 million hectares of bottomland hardwood forest. Today, there is only about 2.8 million hectares remaining (King et al. 2008).&lt;ref&gt;King, S. L., D. J. Twedt, and R. R. Wilson. 2006. The role of the wetland reserve program in conservation efforts in the Mississippi river alluvial valley. Wildlife Society Bulletin. 34: 914-920.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only are southeastern hardwood forests disappearing, but there has been a huge effort to control water flow so that natural forest flooding is less frequent. 
Bottomland hardwood forest is an important wetland habitat for many species of waterfowl, as well as other animals. In order to support migrating waterfowl, both private land managers and public agencies implement green tree reservoirs. In a GTR, a forest stand is flooded to create a seasonal wetland.  These seasonal wetlands provide habitat and food for [[waterfowl]], [[amphibians]], and many other species.

== Management ==
The water level on green tree reservoirs are manipulated by flooding and “draw down,” a process in which water is drained off of the reservoir. There are many methods for flooding a forest stand (Fredrickson and Batema 1992),&lt;ref&gt;Fredrickson. L. H. and D. L. Batema. 1992. Greentree reservoir management handbook. Gaylord Memorial Laboratory, University of Missouri.&lt;/ref&gt; many of which use levees or dykes. Water is either diverted from a natural source or pumped onto the landscape. This usually occurs in early winter, when trees are dormant and less likely to be damaged by standing water. The water should be drawn down before the tree dormancy stage has ended. This dormant season coincides with waterfowl migration, providing habitat for migrating birds.

In most cases, GTRs are flooded to a depth of 2-10 inches. Waterfowl in the order [[Anatinae]] are dabbling ducks that require only a shallow water depth. Diving ducks are less common on the [[Mississippi Flyway]], but they also can utilize a water depth of only 10 inches.
The water depth in a GTR will likely not be uniform. Various water depths allow for different types of food to be available at one time (Fredrickson and Reid 1988).&lt;ref&gt;Fredrickson, L. H. and F. A. Reid. 1988. Waterfowl management handbook. USFWS Fish and Wildlife Leaflet 13.2.1. Washington D. C.&lt;/ref&gt; Every species of animal that uses a GTR has slightly different food and habitat needs. Knowing the life history of the target species is critical to proper manipulation of a GTR.

There are plant and tree species specifically beneficial to waterfowl (discussed below), and the abundance of these species and forest composition can be managed by adjusting flood and draw down on the reservoir (Young et al. 1995).&lt;ref&gt;Young, G. L., B. L. Karr, B. D. Leopold, J. D. Hodges. Effects of greentree reservoir management on Mississippi bottomland hardwoods. Wildlife Society Bulletin. 23: 525-531.&lt;/ref&gt; Bottomland hardwood forests can also be effectively manipulated by removing timber; in some cases it is required to maintain viable forest stands (Kellison and Young 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Kellison, R. C. and M. J. Young. 1997. The bottomland hardwood forest of the southern United States. Forest Ecology and Management. 90: 101-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Older research reflects the view that standing water in GTRs permanently damages trees and acorn production. (Young et al. 1995, Wigley and Filer 1989). However, more current research (King et al. 2006)&lt;ref&gt;King, S. L., D. J. Twedt, and R. R. Wilson. 2006. The role of the wetland reserve program in conservation efforts in the Mississippi river alluvial valley. Wildlife Society Bulletin. 34: 914-920.&lt;/ref&gt; shows that when managed properly, green tree reservoirs can be very productive. Many researchers have found that production in GTRs is highest when managers try to emulate natural hardwood wetlands (Fredrickson and Reid 1988,&lt;ref&gt;Fredrickson, L. H. and F. A. Reid. 1988. Waterfowl management handbook. USFWS Fish and Wildlife Leaflet 13.2.1. Washington D. C.&lt;/ref&gt; King and Allen 1996).&lt;ref&gt;King, S. L. and J. A. Allen. 1996. Plant succession and greentree reservoir management and restoration of bottomland hardwood wetlands. Wetlands. 16:503-511.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, 95% of GTRs were flooded annually and for longer than the dormancy season of the forest (Wigley and Filer 1989).&lt;ref&gt;Wigley, T. B. and T. H. Filer. 1989. Characteristics of greentree reservoirs: a survey of managers. Wildlife Society Bulletin. 17:136-142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many plant species are adapted to a higher water tolerance; working with those plants rather than trying to force a dry-adapted plant to function in a wetland has increased GTR success. For example, [[pin oak]]s are a wetland oak and have small acorns suitable for waterfowl. In one study, researchers found that pin oak acorns even suffered less insect infestation (and therefore produced more usable food items for waterfowl) in flooded areas than in non-flooded forests (McQuilkin and Musbach 1977).&lt;ref&gt;McQuilkin, R. A. and R. A. Musbach. 1977. [[Pin oak]] acorn production on green tree reservoirs in southeastern Missouri. 41: 218-225.&lt;/ref&gt; Encouraging wetland plants suited for seasonally flooded areas supports the natural wetland model and results in better food sources.
In another example, it was found that fall flooding decreases grain availability for spring-migrating waterfowl (Greer et al. 2007).
Now that more research has emerged detailing the natural life history of wetland plants and trees, GTR managers are better prepared to manipulate the resource.

== Waterfowl production ==
The main use of GTRs is to increase production of waterfowl. This is especially true in the southeastern United States, where the Mississippi Flyway encourages duck hunting. Waterfowl that use the [[Mississippi Flyway]] include [[American black duck]] (''Anas rupribes''), [[blue-winged teal]] (''Anas discors''), [[green-winged teal]] (''Anas crecca''), [[gadwall]] (''Anas strepera''), [[northern shoveler]] (''Anas clypeata''), [[northern pintail]] (''Anas acuta''), [[mallard]] (''Anas platyrhynchos''), [[wood duck]] (''Aix sponsa''), and many others.  Migrating waterfowl have high energy needs and require stopover points on their migration route (Martin and Finch 1995).&lt;ref&gt;Martin, T. E. and D. M. Finch. 1995. Ecology and Management of Neotropical Migratory Birds. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; With much of the bottomland hardwood forest in the southeast US destroyed, GTRs provide food and habitat for waterfowl during migration.

During a migration stopover, studies have shown that a duck’s diet may consist of 60% acorns or mast (Allen 1980).&lt;ref&gt;Allen, C. E. 1980. Feeding habits of ducks in a green-tree reservoir in eastern Texas. Journal of Wildlife Management. 44:232-236.&lt;/ref&gt; Migrating waterfowl require good sources of carbohydrates and protein.

Acorns are an important food source for waterfowl, but not every acorn is an acceptable food. Acorns must be small enough for a duck to swallow comfortably. Oak species that produce small acorns includes willow oak(''[[Quercus phellos]]''), water oak (''[[Quercus nigra]]''), pin oak (''[[Quercus palustris]]''), Nutall’s oak (''[[Quercus texana]]''), among several others. When a GTR is flooded, these acorns float to the surface; herbaceous vegetation is also available. Invertebrates common in the leaf litter “bloom” and provide protein for breeding waterfowl.

According to the Waterfowl Management Handbook (Fredrickson and Reid 1988), there are three criteria for foods to be available to waterfowl. 
:
:	“Foods are accessible if: 
:1.	Appropriate water depths are maintained during critical time periods.
:2.	Habitats are protected from disturbance
:3.	Habitats that provide protein and energy are close to one another”&lt;ref&gt;Fredrickson, L. H. and F. A. Reid. 1988. Waterfowl management handbook. USFWS Fish and Wildlife Leaflet 13.2.1. Washington D. C.&lt;/ref&gt;
:
According to Fredrickson and Reid (1988), disturbance from any source is detrimental to waterfowl during their stopover. Proper water depths and the juxtaposition of protein and energy contribute to waterfowl success.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5386">'''IEC 61162''' is a collection of [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standards for "Digital interfaces for navigational equipment within a ship".

The 61162 standards are developed in Working Group 6 (WG6) of Technical Committee 80 (TC80) of the IEC.

==Sections of IEC 61162==
Standard ''IEC 61162'' is divided into four parts:
* Part 1: Single talker and multiple listeners (Also known as [[NMEA 0183]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Design challenges and decisions for a new ship data network|url=http://www.mits-forum.org/resources/lwe-paper-isis-v9.pdf|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Part 2: Single talker and multiple listeners, high-speed transmission
* Part 3: Serial data instrument network (Also known as [[NMEA 2000]])
* Part 450:  Multiple talkers and multiple listeners–Ethernet interconnection (Also known as Lightweight Ethernet)
* Part 460:  Multiple talkers and multiple listeners - Ethernet interconnection - Safety and security
 
The 61162 standards are all concerning the transport of [[National Marine Electronics Association|NMEA]] sentences, but the IEC
does not define any of these. This is left to the [http://www.nmea.org/ NMEA Organization].

==IEC 61162-1==
Single talker and multiple listeners
is an international standard

==IEC 61162-2==
Single talker and multiple listeners, high-speed transmission

==IEC 61162-3==
Serial data instrument network

==IEC 61162-450==
Multiple talkers Multiple listeners

This subgroup of TC80/WG6 has specified the use of Ethernet for shipboard navigational networks. The
specification describes the transport of NMEA sentences as defined in 61162-1 over IPv4. Due to
the low amount of protocol complexity it has been nicknamed Lightweight Ethernet or LWE in short.

The historical background and justification for LWE was presented at the ISIS2011 symposium.&lt;ref&gt;Ø.J. Rødseth, et al. "Overview of the IEC 61162-450 “Light Weight Ethernet” Ship Bridge Data Network", ISIS2011&lt;/ref&gt; An overview article of LWE was
given in the December issue of "Digital Ship"&lt;ref&gt;M.J. Christensen, et al. ''Lightweight Ethernet - a new standard for shipbord networks" [http://issuu.com/mortenjc/docs/digital_ship_december_2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard was published in the first edition 06/2011 . The second edition is in progress(state 05/2016). 

==IEC 61162-460==
IEC 61162-460:2015(E) is an add-on to the IEC 61162-450 standard where higher safety and security standards are needed, e.g. due to higher exposure to external threats or to improve network integrity. This standard provides requirements and test methods for equipment to be used in an IEC 61162-460 compliant network as well as requirements for the network itself and requirements for interconnection from the network to other networks. This standard also contains requirements for a redundant IEC 61162-460 compliant network. This standard extends the informative guidance given in Annex D of IEC 61162-450:2011. It does not introduce new application level protocol requirements to those that are defined in IEC 61162-450. 

The first edition was published in 08/2015.

'''Instantaneous phase''' and '''instantaneous frequency''' are important concepts in [[signal processing]] that occur in the context of the representation and analysis of time-varying functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sejdic|first=E.|last2=Djurovic|first2=I.|last3=Stankovic|first3=L.|date=August 2008|title=Quantitative Performance Analysis of Scalogram as Instantaneous Frequency Estimator|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4511413/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing|volume=56|issue=8|pages=3837–3845|doi=10.1109/TSP.2008.924856|issn=1053-587X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instantaneous phase (or "local phase" or simply "phase") of a ''complex-valued'' function ''s''(''t''), is the real-valued function:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(t) = \arg\{s(t)\},&lt;/math&gt;
where '''arg''' is the [[Argument (complex analysis)|complex argument function]].

And for a ''real-valued'' function ''s''(''t''), it is determined from the function's [[analytic signal|analytic representation]], ''s''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackledge|first=Jonathan M.|title=Digital Signal Processing: Mathematical and Computational Methods, Software Development and Applications|year=2006|publisher=Woodhead Publishing|isbn=1904275265|page=134|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\phi(t) &amp;= \arg\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\} \\
        &amp;= \arg\{s(t) + j \hat{s}(t)\}. \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

When ''φ''(''t'') is constrained to its [[principal value]], either the interval (-π, π] or [0, 2π), it is called ''wrapped phase''. Otherwise it is called ''unwrapped phase'', which is a continuous function of argument ''t'', assuming ''s''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') is a continuous function of ''t''. Unless otherwise indicated, the continuous form should be inferred.

[[File:Phase vs Time, wrapped and unwrapped.jpg|thumb|400px|Instantaneous phase vs time.]]

==Examples==
===Example 1===
:&lt;math&gt;s(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \theta),&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ω'' &gt; 0.
:&lt;math&gt;s_\mathrm{a}(t) = A e^{j(\omega t + \theta)},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(t) = \omega t + \theta.&lt;/math&gt;
In this simple sinusoidal example, the constant ''θ'' is also commonly referred to as ''phase'' or ''phase offset''. ''φ''(''t'') is a function of time; ''θ'' is not. In the next example, we also see that the phase offset of a real-valued sinusoid is ambiguous unless a reference (sin or cos) is specified. ''φ''(''t'') is unambiguously defined.

===Example 2===
:&lt;math&gt;s(t) = A \sin(\omega t) = A \cos(\omega t - \pi/2),&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ω'' &gt; 0.
:&lt;math&gt;s_\mathrm{a}(t) = A e^{j (\omega t - \pi/2)},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(t) = \omega t - \pi/2.&lt;/math&gt;
In both examples the local maxima of ''s''(''t'') correspond to ''φ''(''t'') = 2π''N'' for integer values of ''N''. This has applications in the field of computer vision.

==Instantaneous frequency==
'''Instantaneous angular frequency''' is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\omega(t) = \frac{d\phi(t)}{dt},&lt;/math&gt;
and '''instantaneous (ordinary) frequency''' is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f(t) &amp; =  \tfrac{1}{2\pi} \omega(t) \\
     &amp; = \tfrac{1}{2\pi} \frac{d\phi(t)}{dt} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''φ''(''t'') '''must''' be the ''unwrapped'' instantaneous phase angle. If ''φ''(''t'') is wrapped, discontinuities in ''φ''(''t'') will result in [[dirac delta]] impulses in ''f''(''t'').

The inverse operation, which always unwraps phase, is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\phi(t) &amp;= \int_{-\infty}^t \omega(\tau)\, d\tau = 2 \pi \int_{-\infty}^t f(\tau)\, d\tau\\
        &amp;= \int_{-\infty}^0 \omega(\tau)\, d\tau + \int_{0}^{t} \omega(\tau)\, d\tau\\
        &amp;= \phi(0) + \int_0^t \omega(\tau)\, d\tau.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This instantaneous frequency, ''ω''(t), can be derived directly from the [[Complex number|real and imaginary parts]] of ''s''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), instead of the [[Argument (complex analysis)|complex arg]] without concern of phase unwrapping.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\phi(t) &amp;= \arg\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\} \\
        &amp;= \operatorname{atan2}(\Im\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\},\Re\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}) + 2 m_1 \pi \\
        &amp;= \arctan\left( \frac{\Im\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}}{\Re\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}} \right) + m_2 \pi \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

2''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;π and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;π are the integer multiples of π necessary to add to unwrap the phase. At values of time, ''t'', where there is no change to integer ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the derivative of ''φ''(''t'') is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\omega(t) &amp;= \frac{d\phi(t)}{dt} \\
        &amp;= \frac{d}{dt} \arctan\left( \frac{\Im\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}}{\Re\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}} \right) \\
\\
        &amp;= \frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{\Im\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}}{\Re\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}} \right)^2} \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\Im\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}}{\Re\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}} \right) \\
\\
        &amp;= \frac{\Re\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\} \frac{d\Im\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}}{dt} - \Im\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\} \frac{d\Re\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}}{dt} }{(\Re\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\})^2 + (\Im\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\})^2 } \\
\\
        &amp;= \frac{1}{|s_\mathrm{a}(t)|^2 } \left(\Re\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\} \frac{d\Im\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}}{dt} - \Im\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\} \frac{d\Re\{s_\mathrm{a}(t)\}}{dt} \right) \\
        &amp;= \frac{1}{(s(t))^2 + ((\hat{s}(t))^2} \left(s(t) \frac{d\hat{s}(t)}{dt} - \hat{s}(t) \frac{ds(t)}{dt} \right) \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For discrete-time functions, this can be written as a recursion:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi[n] = \phi[n-1] + \omega[n] = \phi[n-1] + \underbrace{\arg\{s_\mathrm{a}[n]\} - \arg\{s_\mathrm{a}[n-1]\}}_{\Delta \phi[n]}.&lt;/math&gt;

Discontinuities can then be removed by adding 2π whenever Δ''φ''[''n''] ≤ −π, and subtracting 2π whenever Δ''φ''[''n''] &gt; π. That allows ''φ''[''n''] to accumulate without limit and produces an unwrapped instantaneous phase. An equivalent formulation that replaces the modulo 2π operation with a complex multiplication is:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi[n] = \phi[n-1] + \arg\{s_\mathrm{a}[n] \, s_\mathrm{a}^*[n-1]\},&lt;/math&gt;
where the asterisk denotes complex conjugate. The discrete-time instantaneous frequency (in units of radians per sample) is simply the advancement of phase for that sample
:&lt;math&gt;\omega[n] = \arg\{s_\mathrm{a}[n] \, s_\mathrm{a}^*[n-1]\}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Complex representation==
In some applications, such as averaging the values of phase at several moments of time, it may be useful to convert each value to a complex number, or vector representation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=S.|title=An Improved Quality Guided Phase Unwrapping Method and Its Applications to MRI|journal=Progress in Electromagnetics Research-PIER|date=2014|volume=145|pages=273–286|url=http://www.jpier.org/PIER/pier.php?paper=14021005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
e^{i\phi(t)}
&amp;= \frac{s_\mathrm{a}(t)}{|s_\mathrm{a}(t)|}\\
&amp;= \cos(\phi(t)) + i \sin(\phi(t)).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This representation is similar to the wrapped phase representation in that it does not distinguish between multiples of 2π in the phase, but similar to the unwrapped phase representation since it is continuous. A vector-average phase can be obtained as the [[Argument (complex analysis)|arg]] of the sum of the complex numbers without concern about wrap-around.

'''Josephine Louise Miles''' (June 11, 1911 – May 12, 1985) was an [[United States|American]] poet and literary critic; the first woman [[tenure]]d in the [[English studies|English Department]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="CaliSphere" /&gt; She wrote over a dozen books of poetry and several works of criticism.

Miles was born in Chicago, in 1911. When she was young, her family moved to Southern California.&lt;ref name="CaliSphere" /&gt; Due to disabling arthritis, she was educated at home by tutors, but was able to graduate from Los Angeles High School in a class that included the composer [[John Cage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www26.us.archive.org/stream/poetryjosephine00milerich/poetryjosephine00milerich_djvu.txt | title=Interview conducted at the Josephine Miles house 1977-1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miles attended the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], where she earned a bachelor's degree in English literature before moving to the [[University of California, Berkeley]] to pursue a doctorate. She received a Fellowship from the [[American Association of University Women]] in 1939. Her dissertation work on Wordsworth led to ''Wordsworth and the Vocabulary of Emotion'', published in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wordsworth and the vocabulary of emotion|last=Miles|first=Josephine|date=1976|publisher=Octagon Books|isbn=978-0-374-95681-3|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In her early career, Miles became a foundational scholar of quantitative and computational methods in the humanities.&lt;ref name=SearchReplace&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 3| issue = 1| title = Search and Replace: Josephine Miles and the Origins of Distant Reading| journal = Modernism / Modernity Print+| accessdate = 2018-08-17| date = 2018-04-11| url = https://modernismmodernity.org/forums/posts/search-and-replace}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s and 1940s, she conducted [[distant reading]] research projects, first on "the adjectives favored by Romantic poets" and second on "the phrasal forms of the poetry of the 1640s, 1740s, and 1840s."&lt;ref name=SearchReplace /&gt; In the 1950s, she became director of project creating a Concordance to the Poetical Works of John Dryden. The project had previously been based in index cards, but Miles worked with the Electrical Engineering department at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]] to complete the concordance used punched cards and card-reading computers. After six years of work by a team including Miles, female graduate students, and female punch card operators, the concordance with published.&lt;ref name=SearchReplace /&gt; Rachel Sagner Buurma and Laura Heffernan describe this as "possibly the first literary concordance to use machine methods"; it was published seventeen years before the first volume of [[Roberto Busa]]'s ''[[Index Thomisticus]]'', a work widely credited with this first.&lt;ref name=SearchReplace /&gt;

In 1964, she was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter M|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterM.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She remained in Berkeley for the rest of her life, receiving many highly coveted fellowships and awards until her death in May 1985. She was the first woman to receive tenure in the English Department at Berkeley and, at the time of her death, held the position of University Professor—one of the rarest and most prestigious honors in academic life.&lt;ref name="CaliSphere" /&gt;

She was fascinated with [[Beat generation|Beat]] poetry, and was both a host and critic to many Beat poets from her chair at Berkeley. Most notably, she helped [[Allen Ginsberg]] publish ''Howl'' by recommending it to [[Richard Eberhart]], who published an article in the ''New York Times'' praising the poem. In 1974, she founded the internationally distributed ''[[Berkeley Poetry Review]]'' on the U.C. Berkeley campus.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite news | author=Knight, Brenda, ed. | title=Josephine Miles - Women of the Beat Generation | work=Biography | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vnjTmEsXJwcC&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;ots=aDIqJ666Q6&amp;dq=Josephine%20miles%20women%20of%20the%20beat&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q=Josephine%20miles%20women%20of%20the%20beat&amp;f=false |  accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miles mentored many young poets, including [[Jack Spicer]], [[Robin Blaser]], [[Diane Wakoski]], [[Diana O'Hehir]],  [[William Stafford (poet)|William Stafford]], and [[A. R. Ammons]].&lt;ref name="CaliSphere"&gt;{{cite news | publisher=Calisphere, University of California | title=Josephine Miles, English: Berkeley | url=http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb4d5nb20m&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00112&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id= | accessdate=October 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reference to her lifelong disability, [[Thom Gunn]] recollected that “The unavoidable first fact about Josephine Miles was physical. As a young child she contracted a form of degenerative arthritis so severe that it left her limbs deformed and crippled. As a result, she could not be left alone in a house, she could not handle a mug...she could not use a typewriter; and she could neither walk nor operate a wheelchair.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Thom | last=Gunn | title=In Memoriam: Josephine Miles | publisher=''California Monthly'' 95:6:29 | date=June–July 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Miles bequeathed her Berkeley home to the University of California, which offers the house for use by the visiting Roberta C. Holloway Lecturer in the Practice of Poetry.

The [[PEN Oakland/Josephine Miles Literary Award]] was established in her honor to recognize achievement in multicultural literature.

The '''Molteno Institute for Research in Parasitology''' was a biological research institute in the [[University of Cambridge]], UK, situated on the Downing Site and founded in response to an appeal by the [[Quick Professor]] by a $150 000 gift from Mr &amp; Mrs [[Percy Molteno|Percy Alport Molteno]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0031182000010040| title = The Molteno Institute for Research in Parasitology, University of Cambridge, with an Account of how it came to be founded| journal = Parasitology| volume = 14| issue = 2| pages = 97| year = 1922| last1 = Nuttall | first1 = G H F}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When it opened in 1921&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZLo8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA118#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Cambridge Medical School|last1=Rolleston|first1=Sir Humphry Davy|year=1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was the first parasite biology institute to be established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Notes|journal=The Journal of Parasitology|date=December 1919|volume=6|issue=2|page=104|publisher=Allen Press|jstor=3270903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1947 and 1964 the MRC ([[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]]) Chemotherapy Research Unit was based in 'the Molteno', but research into parasitology continued alongside.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2160">A '''musical argument''' is a means of creating [[tension (music)|tension]] through the relation of [[emotional expression|expressive content]] and [[musical form]]:
{{quote|Traditional [[dialectic|dialectal]]{{efn|The purpose of the dialectic method of reasoning is resolution of disagreement through rational discussion between opposing viewpoints.}}
 music is [[representation (arts)|representational]]: the musical form relates to an expressive content and is a means of creating a growing tension; this is what is usually called the musical argument.|[[Wim Mertens]] (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Mertens, Wim (1999). ''American Minimal Music: La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, Philip Glass'', reprinted edition (London: Kahn &amp; Averill), p.88. {{ISBN|1871082005}}. Quoted in LaBelle, Brandon (2006). ''Background Noise'' (London and New York: Continuum), p.7. {{ISBN|9780826418449}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Experimental musics may use [[process music|process]] or [[indeterminacy (music)|indeterminacy]] rather than argument.&lt;ref&gt;LaBelle (2006), p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical argument may be characterized as the primary flow and current idea being presented in a piece:
{{quote|The very definition of musical argument is something that keeps going, and you uncover new details and new combinations. A musical argument is not the same as a [[disagreement|verbal argument]]. A [[debate|verbal argument]] implies that there's {{sic}} two sides; a musical argument makes the two sides one thing, like [[counterpoint]]. A [[fugue]] is like that; a [[Fugue#Double (triple, quadruple) fugue|double fugue]], at least, takes two different [[theme (music)|ideas]] and shows you how they relate, and it shows you how they're the same thing.|[[Phil Lesh]] (1982)&lt;ref&gt;Gans, David (2002). ''Conversations With The Dead'', p.166. {{ISBN|9780306810992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Thus one may hear of a musical argument being interrupted, extended, or [[repetition (music)|repeated]].{{or-inline|date=February 2017}}

[[Image:NAEA logo sq.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Logo]] of the National Art Education Association.]]
The '''National Art Education Association''' (NAEA) is a [[professional association]] founded in 1947 in the United States. It is the world's largest professional [[art education]] association.

The NAEA's annual convention attracts thousands of art educators and offers art educators a chance to network, establish mentor relationships, and attend professional development events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/index.asp?layout=talkbackCommentsFull&amp;talk_back_header_id=6649576&amp;articleid=CA6726768 Melissa Techman, "Art Teachers Bring 21st-Century Vision to 2010 Conference", ''School Library Journal'', Apr. 20, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;  The NAEA also gives awards for Art Educator of the Year at this convention.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/life/stories/2010/04/19/1a-showtell19-art-gj686cra-1.html?sid=101 "OSU educator honored", ''The Columbus Dispatch'', Apr. 19, 2010], [http://kohd.com/page/170770 "Oregon's Best Art Teacher Selected from Bend", KOHD.com, Apr. 20, 2010], [http://www.dentonrc.com/sharedcontent/dws/drc/entertainment/stories/DRC_artbriefs_0418.25ac6816d.html "UNT art professor wins national award", ''Denton Record-Chronicle'', Apr. 18, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the [[Art &amp; Creative Materials Institute]], in 1969, the NAEA began sponsoring March as [[Youth Art Month]].  Since 1984, Youth Art Month has been run by the [[Council for Art Education, Inc.]], which consists of representatives of the NAEA and other art associations.

As an advocacy organization, the NAEA speaks out in favor of increased funding for art education, and opposing cuts to art funding.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://peoplesworld.org/emergency-funding-urged-to-prevent-worst-school-cuts-in-50-years/ Susan Webb, "Emergency funding urged to prevent worst school cuts in 50 years", ''People's World'', Apr. 21, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The NAEA publishes two journals, ''Art Education'' and ''Studies in Art Education''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/publisher/naea Publisher Information from Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Graphene Institute''' is a [[research institute]] and building at the [[University of Manchester]] that is focused on the research of [[graphene]]. Construction of the building to house the institute started in 2013&lt;ref name="UoMJan13" /&gt; and finished in 2015.

== Institute ==
[[File:National Graphene Institute 2016.jpg|thumb|left|The building in 2016]]
The creation of the institute, including the construction of the building, cost £61&amp;nbsp;million. Funded by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]] (£38m) and the [[European Union]]'s [[European Regional Development Fund]] (£23m), the building is the national centre for graphene research in the UK. It provides facilities for industry and university academics to collaborate on [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-32100071 graphene applications] and the commercialisation of graphene. The building was opened on 20 March 2015 by [[George Osborne]].&lt;ref name="UoM20Mar15" /&gt;

== Building ==
[[File:National Graphene Institute.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The National Graphene Institute under construction in August 2014]]
The five-story glass-fronted building provides {{convert|7,600|sqm|sqft}} of research space. This includes 1,500 square metres (16,000 sq ft) of class [[Cleanroom|100 and class 1000 clean rooms]], one of which occupies the entire lower ground floor (in order to minimise vibrations&lt;ref name="jesticopdf" /&gt;)&lt;ref name="UoMJan13" /&gt; plus laser, optical, metrology and chemical laboratories, along with offices, a seminar room and accommodation.&lt;ref name="jestico" /&gt; The top floor also includes a roof terrace, which has 21 different grasses and wildflowers designed to attract urban bees and other species of pollinators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = National Graphene Institute (NGI) {{!}} The University of Manchester|url = http://www.graphene.manchester.ac.uk/collaborate/national-graphene-institute/|website = www.graphene.manchester.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outside of the building consists of a composite cladding, with an external stainless steel 'veil'.&lt;ref name="jesticopdf" /&gt; The building faces on to [[Booth Street East]]. Construction started in March 2013, with the building being completed in 2015.&lt;ref name="UoMJan13" /&gt;

The building was designed by [[Jestico + Whiles]]. It cost around £30m, and was constructed by [[Bam Construct]]. The structural design was produced by [[Ramboll]]. Other shortlisted organisations are: [[Lend Lease Group|Lend Lease]], [[Laing O’Rourke]], [[Morgan Sindall]], [[Vinci (construction)|Vinci]], and [[M&amp;W Group]]).&lt;ref name="BuildingMay13" /&gt; The design work was led by [[EC Harris]], along with [[CH2M Hill]] who provided specialist technical architecture design services for the cleanrooms and laboratories, together with Mechanical, Electrical and Process (MEP) consultant services.&lt;ref name="jesticopdf" /&gt;

=== History of the location ===
[[File:Excavations at the site of the National Graphene Institute 19.jpg|thumb|right|Excavations at the site of the Institute.]]
The Institute was constructed on the former site of the Albert Club, which was a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] club that was located between Lawson Street and Clifford Street.&lt;ref name="manchester2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="men2013" /&gt; The club was established for the middle class [[Germans|German]] community that were involved in Manchester's [[cotton trade]], and [[Friedrich Engels]] frequented it during his time in the city, becoming a member in 1842.&lt;ref name="manchester2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="men2013" /&gt; The club was located on Clifford Street from 1842 prior to its relocation in 1859.&lt;ref name="engelsbook" /&gt; The building was constructed by the architect [[Jeptha Pacey]] as his personal house, and it was fronted by formal gardens. It was later converted into a private social club, which was named after [[Albert, Prince Consort]]. More recently it had been re-purposed as [[Turkish bath|Turkish]] [[Public bathing|public baths]],&lt;ref name="manchester2013" /&gt; and was later used as a hospital for women and children.&lt;ref name="museummeets" /&gt; The building was demolished in the 1960s,{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} and the site was used for the construction of the Lamb Building.&lt;ref name="planning" /&gt;

The excavations that took place in February 2013 by [[Oxford Archaeology North]], prior to the construction of the Institute, uncovered the remnants of the club building along with a row of five cellars belonging to 1830s [[terraced housing]]. A sink removed from the site has been incorporated into the institute's new building.&lt;ref name="manchester2013" /&gt; As the main clean room of the new building will be located 3 metres below ground level,&lt;ref name="planning" /&gt; the remains of the Albert Club were not conserved.

The '''National Research Council of Canada Nanotechnology Research Centre''' (formerly National Institute for Nanotechnology){{cn|date=July 2018}} is a [[research institution]] located on the [[University of Alberta]] main campus, in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]].  Its primary purpose is nanoscience research.

The institute was established in 2001 as a partnership between the [[National Research Council of Canada]], the [[University of Alberta]], and the Government of Alberta.  It is administered as an institute of the National Research Council of Canada (NRC), and governed by a Board of Trustees nominated by the partners. Its core funding comes from the Government of Canada and additional funding and research support comes from the university, [[Government of Alberta]], and various federal and provincial funding agencies.

In June 2006, the institute moved into its present 200,000 square metre facility, designed to be one of the world's largest buildings for nanotechnological research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/newsroom/news/2006/nint06-nr_e.html Flagship Nanotechnology Institute's New Home Features Canada's Quietest Space]&lt;/ref&gt; There are at most two or three other facilities worldwide matching the new building in scale and capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineering.ualberta.ca/nav02.cfm?nav02=30429&amp;nav01=18430 U of A Receives $15 Million Grant for Nanosystems Research Facility], Faculty of Engineering, University of Alberta. Accessed on 3 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the institute became the Nanotechnology Research Centre, following a recognition of the institute as its own research centre. Although on the premises of the University of Alberta, the research centre is a branch of the National Research Council of Canada.

'''Optimot, linguistic inquiries''', is a service provided by the Directorate - General of Linguistic Policy of the Catalan Government in collaboration with the [[Institut d'Estudis Catalans|Institute for Catalan Studies]] and the Terminology Center TERMCAT. It consists of a search engine for linguistic information that helps to clarify doubts about the Catalan language. With Optimot different sources can be checked at the same time in an integrated way. When the search options provided by Optimot do not manage to answer the linguistic question, a personalized inquiry service can be accessed.

== History ==
Up to 2007, the Consortium for Linguistic Normalization, the TERMCAT Terminology Centre, the Institute of Catalan Studies, and the directorate-general of Linguistics Politics dealt with linguistic inqueries that came from general population, companies, organizations, and language professionals. In order to avoid decentralization of the linguistic enquiries and to offer a unified service, Optimot was implemented. The search engine started working in October 2007 and the personalized service began in February 2008. Mainly, Optimot was to improve quality in linguistic-inquiry service by unifying criteria, and to promote linguistic autonomy.

== Search sources ==
The sources used in the searches performed by Optimot are the following:&lt;ref&gt;«[http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/Llengcat/menuitem.91021952ed2301e7a129d410b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=ee8e44ce74aa3110VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD Optimot, consultes lingüístiques]».&amp;#x20;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oyster reef restoration''' refers to the process of rebuilding or restoring of [[oyster reef]]s all over the globe. Over time, [[oyster]]s have been negatively affected by environmental change, such as harmful fishing techniques,&lt;ref name="Restoration Suitability"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollack|first1=Jennifer Beseres|last2=Cleveland|first2=Andrew|last3=Palmer|first3=Terence A.|title=A Restoration Suitability Index Model for the Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) in the Mission-Aransas Estuary, TX, USA.|journal=PLoS ONE|date=July 2012|volume=7|issue=7|pages=1–11|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0040839|pmid=22792410|pmc=3394728}}&lt;/ref&gt; over harvesting,&lt;ref name="Oyster Restoration Nekton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Laura A.|last2=Furlong|first2=Jessica N.|last3=Brown|first3=Kenneth M.|title=Oyster Reef Restoration in the Northern Gulf of Mexico: Effect of Artificial Substrate and Age on Nekton and Benthic Macroinvertebrate Assemblage Use|journal=Restoration Ecology|date=March 2014|volume=22|issue=2|pages=214–222|doi=10.1111/rec.12071}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[water pollution]], and other factors. The results of these factors have been disease and ultimately, a large decline in the global population of oysters and the prevalence and sustainability of oyster reefs. Apart from the ecological importance of oyster reefs, [[oyster farming]] is an important industry, particularly in coastal areas. Both artificial materials and natural components have been used to rebuild the reefs in an attempt to regenerate the oyster population thus fostering the reformation of reefs.&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration alternative substrates"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=George|first1=Lindsey|last2=De Santiago|first2=Kevin|last3=Palmer|first3=Terence|title=Oyster reef restoration: effect of alternative substrates on oyster recruitment and nekton habitat use.|journal=Journal of Coastal Conservation |date=February 2015|volume=19|issue=1|pages=13–22|doi=10.1007/s11852-014-0351-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecosystem and history ==
The first stage in an oyster’s life cycle is the free-swimming larval stage. After about three weeks, the larva attaches to a hard [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]]—surface area to attach to—such as prop roots, dock pilings, natural rock, and other oysters becoming an oyster spat—oysters that have just settled to the bottom.&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oysterrestoration.com/faq.html |title=Oyster Reef Restoration Project |publisher=Oysterrestoration.com |date=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of oysters often join together, thus forming an oyster reef (also referred to as oyster bed, oyster mat).&lt;ref name="state1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/huntwild/wild/species/easternoyster/ |title=Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) |publisher=Tpwd.state.tx.us |date=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once attached to a surface, oysters will stay there for the remainder of their lives.

Oyster beds provide a number of ecological, economical and recreational benefits to the environment. On the Atlantic coast of the United States, the Eastern Oyster acts as a [[keystone species]] by filtering [[estuaries]] and maintaining healthy coastal ecosystems. In addition to being a keystone species, oysters also serve as an [[indicator species]]—they are used to gather information on the overall health of the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project" /&gt;

Since the early Americas, oyster beds have been beneficial for the North American Indians, who harvested oysters for subsistence purposes, and for the European colonists in the region.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Since the 19th century oyster beds have been vital for commercial harvests and have generated substantial income.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sms.si.edu/IRLSpec/Oyster_reef.htm |title=Oyster_reef |publisher=Sms.si.edu |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of oyster populations have greatly declined within the last century due to over-harvesting, dredging, increased sedimentation, invasive species, pollution and disease.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.habitat.noaa.gov/restoration/techniques/oysterrestoration.html |title=NOAA Habitat Conservation &amp;#124; Restoration Center &amp;#124; Restoration Techniques and Monitoring &amp;#124; Oyster Restoration |publisher=Habitat.noaa.gov |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that more than 85% of oyster reefs are gone, making it the most threatened marine habitat in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aibs.org/bioscience-press-releases/resources/Beck.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927012527/http://www.aibs.org/bioscience-press-releases/resources/Beck.pdf |date=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, this has spawned a need for oyster restoration projects in order to revitalize the depleted natural resource of the oyster population.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; In response to this decline, many oyster restoration projects have been put into place throughout the southeastern United States. The projects develop a long-term strategy of sustained productivity for oyster reefs and restore the ecological role they provide to nearby reef habitats.&lt;ref name="carteret1"&gt;http://main2.carteret.edu/~kemps/files/Oyster%20Gardening%20Manual%20print.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="southalabama1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.southalabama.edu/marinesciences/oysterproposal.doc | title=Marine Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
The first step in oyster restoration is to determine the locations for potential reefs. This is often done by comprehensive surveys that measure salinity levels, water quality, previous existence of oyster reefs, substrate conditions, prevalence of diseases, tidal range, oxygen concentration, algae concentration, prevalence of predators, accessibility and security.&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project"/&gt;&lt;ref name="carteret1"/&gt;

Once the location is determined, cultch—fossilized shell, coral or other similar materials produced by living organisms designed to provide points of attachment for oysters&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project"/&gt;—is often obtained from sustainable recycling programs. Used oyster and clam shells from farmers and restaurants are collected and disinfected by volunteers to be used in oyster restoration.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fgcu.edu/CAS/OysterResearch/2768.asp |title=Oyster Restoration (OYR) |publisher=Fgcu.edu |date=November 23, 2009 |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once returned to the water, these recycled shells provide substrate for oyster larval eggs to begin populating oyster beds laid out by volunteers programs such as those implemented in Southwest Florida,&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; North Carolina,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncfisheries.net/shellfish/recycle1.htm |title=NCDMF Oyster Sanctuaries |publisher=Ncfisheries.net |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aquanic.org/species/shellfish/documents/oysterrestoration.pdf |accessdate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026092221/http://aquanic.org/species/shellfish/documents/oysterrestoration.pdf |archivedate=October 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; South Carolina,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saltwaterfishing.sc.gov/oyster.html |title=Saltwater Recreational Fishing License Program |publisher=Saltwaterfishing.sc.gov |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shellfish.uga.edu/pdf/brochures/ga_program_07_proof2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Southern California, and Alabama.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;[http://www.marsci.uga.edu/gaseagrant/pdf/MAREX%20BULLETIN%20VOL.%208%20Intertidal%20Growth.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720025307/http://www.marsci.uga.edu/gaseagrant/pdf/MAREX%20BULLETIN%20VOL.%208%20Intertidal%20Growth.pdf |date=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common species of oysters used in oyster restoration is the Eastern American oyster ([[Crassostrea virginica]]),&lt;ref name="state1" /&gt; which is also called the American Oyster, Atlantic Oyster, Common Oyster, and Virginia Oyster.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

According to the Southern Regional Aquaculture Center (SRAC), oysters in the southern part of the United States spawn when water temperatures are above 68 degrees.&lt;ref name="carteret1" /&gt; But they are affected more by the specific site where oyster restoration projects occur, the species of oysters used in a project, and if they are native to the surrounding area and disease free.&lt;ref name="nature1"&gt;[http://www.nature.org/files/lease_sub_lands.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516200458/http://www.nature.org/files/lease_sub_lands.pdf |date=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly in the southeastern U.S., mangroves and other shoreline vegetation are often planted in conjunction with oyster restoration efforts to provide substrate – surface area to attach to – and reduce shoreline erosion resulting in less sediment deposits within estuaries.&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project"/&gt;

Oyster restoration in public waters often requires permits and licenses from various agencies with requirements varying from state to state. Most often permits typically involve the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], state natural resource agencies and state public health departments.&lt;ref name="carteret1"/&gt;

== Goals ==
The typical desired outcomes of these restoration projects are the restoration of oyster reefs to produce a fully functioning, three-dimensional bed system that provides associated ecosystem services and biological functions, such as marine biodiversity, shoreline protection, sediment trapping, water quality improvement, and recreational fishing opportunities.

NOAA provides some of the major goals of an oyster restoration project:
* Augment commercial harvest
* Serve as habitat
* Improve water quality
* Increase or improve spat set in an area by creating oyster sanctuaries
* Maintain or increase biodiversity
* Restore ecological function
* Provide a barrier to prevent beach or shoreline erosion
* Protect and enhance sea grass restoration projects&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Intertidal oysters act as a keystone species by maintaining a healthy coastal ecosystem.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marex.uga.edu/shellfish/oysterrest.html |title=G.E.O.R.G.I.A |publisher=Marex.uga.edu |date=September 15, 2011 |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They filter the water and increase water clarity by extracting organic and inorganic particles.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The filtration capacity of an average adult oyster is estimated to be 50 gallons per day.&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oysterrecovery.org/Content/ContentDisplay.aspx?ContentID=88 |title=Oyster Recovery Partnership: Shell Recycling Alliance |publisher=Oysterrecovery.org |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oysters not only clean the water, but also act as effective shoreline buffers&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project"/&gt; by dissipating the energy caused by boat wakes and waves.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt; Oyster reefs also support critical fisheries by providing habitat for numerous species of fish, crustaceans and shellfish.&lt;ref name="southalabama1"/&gt;

The ecological value of reusing oyster shells for oyster restoration projects is vital not only for producing zero waste, but also for diversifying and increasing the number of oyster beds in a given area.&lt;ref name="nature2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/florida/misc/art26796.html#partners |title=Florida Nature Conservation, Environment Issues &amp;#124; The Nature Conservancy |publisher=Nature.org |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to environmental benefits, oyster restoration is also economically beneficial since coastal communities rely heavily on oysters for profit and subsistence.&lt;ref name="nature2"/&gt;

=== Environmental preventative issues ===
Some ancient reefs are used to make restorative oyster reefs in nearby sites. However, to reduce the risk of environmental damage when dredging, many projects tend to stay away from this method of transplanting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncseagrant.org/home/coastwatch/coastwatch-articles?task=showArticle&amp;id=519 |title=North Carolina Sea Grant – Coastwatch Articles |publisher=Ncseagrant.org |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue of environmental harm is placing invasive or newly introduced oyster species in an unknown habitat that can cause more harm than good.&lt;ref name="nature1"/&gt; Therefore, it is important to correctly place oyster species in their respective habitats to prevent environmental harm to nearby oyster reefs.&lt;ref name="nature1"/&gt; More information is available in local extension agencies within the state you live in.&lt;ref name="carteret1"/&gt;

== Economic value ==
Oyster reefs provide essential habitats for many ecological and economically important fish as well as invertebrate species.&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project"/&gt; Healthy oyster populations improve the quality of water, which in turn improves commercial and recreational fishing, recreational boating, and [[ecotourism]].&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project"/&gt; Not only does oyster restoration create additional jobs through the duration of projects, but it also safeguards many other jobs ranging from marine construction to scientific research jobs.&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project"/&gt; Dr. Paul Zimba, Director of the Center for Coastal Studies at [[Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi]] said, "Oysters are an important ecological and economic resource. They create habitats for fish and shellfish, filter and clean bay waters, protect shorelines from erosion, and are a valued commercial fishery element."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Markham|first=Derek|title=Reefs could be replenished with electric oysters|url=http://www.treehugger.com/clean-technology/reefs-could-be-replenished-electric-oysters.html|publisher=Tree Hugger|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aquaculture'''

The research in [[aquaculture]] has been a major contributor to the development of viable oyster strains to assist the commercial aquaculture industry and local ecosystems.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; The industry of aquaculture is booming with global profits exceeding $3,000,000,000 annually.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; Oyster restoration projects assist in the production of aquaculture harvests and have different procedural measures for different areas of the United States.

Aquaculture techniques vary geographically and represent regional differences.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; Some areas of the U.S. have enacted policies to lease out areas for aquaculture businesses to utilize the oyster-restored beds. These leasing policies will prove beneficial to job creation in coastal areas, improve the surrounding economy, and restore habitats where oyster restoration projects and commercial businesses occur.&lt;ref name="maryland1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governor.maryland.gov/pressreleases/091203.asp |title=Governor O'Malley Proposes Oyster Restoration and Aquaculture Development Plan |publisher=Governor.maryland.gov |date=December 3, 2009 |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All in all, aquaculture has and will continue to gain recognition for providing sustainable harvesting methods.&lt;ref name="maryland1"/&gt;

== Social value ==
Oyster restoration has many recreational benefits. Improved water clarity and overall cleaner water greatly increases recreational fishing, boating and swimming. This allows locals and tourists to appreciate the environment around them.&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project"/&gt;

In many parts of the southeastern United States volunteer efforts are responsible for oyster restoration. Community-based oyster restoration programs allow people to become knowledgeable on the important benefits oysters provide to an ecosystem. This volunteerism connects individuals with their environment as well as ensures the existence of oyster populations for future generations to appreciate.&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nature2"/&gt; Areas of the southeastern United States, such as the coastal areas in the Gulf of Mexico, have a rich tradition related to oysters and other marine food that coastal areas provide. Oysters are part of the social culture in these areas and oyster restoration is a step towards preserving their traditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://el.erdc.usace.army.mil/elpubs/pdf/er01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to volunteering with oyster restoration projects, individuals with shoreline property—or those who have access to it—have the option of backyard shellfish gardening. This sustainable form of oyster harvesting allows for personal consumption or environmental enhancement and usually does not require special licenses or permits.&lt;ref name="carteret1"/&gt;

== Specific examples in the southeastern United States ==

=== Florida ===
The Oyster Reef Restoration began in June 2009 and is expected to be completed by the fall of 2010. The project is funded by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) as part of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]. The goal of the project is to restore the important oyster habitat in the St. Lucie and Loxahatchee Estuaries, two of the largest brackish water systems on the east coast of Florida, where over the last 50 years oyster populations have declined by as much as 75%.&lt;ref name="Oyster Reef Restoration Project"/&gt;

=== South Carolina ===
South Carolina Oyster Restoration and Enhancement (SCORE) is another volunteer oyster restoration movement. SCORE operates under the direction of the [[South Carolina Department of Natural Resources]] (SCDNR) and began in May 2001. The sites span approximately {{convert|200|mi|km}} of the South Carolina coastline and have constructed 188 oyster reefs at 35 sites since the program began.&lt;ref name="Restoration Sites"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://score.dnr.sc.gov/deep.php?subject=24 |title=Restoration Sites |publisher=Score.dnr.sc.gov |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North Carolina ===
The Eastern Oyster populations of the Tar-Pamlico and Neuse River basins have plunged 97% to 3% of historic numbers throughout the last century.&lt;ref name="carteret1"/&gt; In response to this drastic change, the Citizens’ Oyster Gardening Project (COGP) began. COGP is an environmental demonstration project that encourages oyster gardening aimed to reestablish populations of native Eastern Oysters in North Carolina through education and aquaculture methods. Educational workshops teach volunteers how to measure water quality and give information on oyster gardening techniques as well as necessary tools and materials. Advocacy through networking by volunteers is key to COGP’s success.&lt;ref name="Aqu Cogp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carteret.edu/aqu/cogp/ |title=Aqu Cogp |publisher=Carteret.edu |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specific examples in Eastern United States ==

=== New York ===
As of September 2016, the Environmental Protection Department of New York City has added nearly 50,000 adult oysters to Jamaica Bay.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/05/nyregion/oyster-project-new-york-harbor.html|title=Oysters Are Nearly Extinct in New York Waters.

Pete Malinowski is a founder and director of the [[Billion Oyster Project]] who hopes to rejuvenate 1 billion oysters into the New York City waters and says, “It used to be known for its oysters. At one time, half of the world’s oysters were harvested in the New York Harbor.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The goal seems ambitious but pales to the number of oysters that populated the waters in colonial times: 3 trillion oysters, and 300,000,000,000,000,000,000 annual spawn of oyster larvae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Catch The Fight For Our Local Seafood|last=Greenberg|first=Paul|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2015|isbn=978-1-59420-448-7|location=USA|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, 85 cages with five gallons of oysters each were tied to a 400 pound anchor and pulled into the harbor to be dropped. For 2 years the department will assess the surrounding water quality and monitor oyster beds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="52576">&lt;!-- The majority of paragraphs begin with "Intelligent urbanism..."  This extensive redundancy definitely needs to be addressed. --&gt;
'''Principles of intelligent urbanism''' ('''PIU''') is a theory of [[urban planning]] composed of a set of ten axioms intended to guide the formulation of city plans and urban designs. They are intended to reconcile and integrate diverse urban planning and management concerns. These axioms include [[Environmentalism|environmental]] [[sustainability]], [[heritage conservation]], [[appropriate technology]], infrastructure-efficiency, [[placemaking]], [[social access]], [[transit-oriented development]],  [[regional integration]], [[human scale]], and institutional integrity. The term was coined by Prof. [[Christopher Charles Benninger]].

The '''PIU''' evolved from the city planning guidelines formulated by the [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne|''International Congress of Modern Architecture'' (CIAM)]], the urban design approaches developed at Harvard's pioneering Urban Design Department under the leadership of [[Josep Lluis Sert]], and the concerns enunciated by [[Team Ten]].  It is most prominently seen in plans prepared by [[Christopher Charles Benninger]] and his numerous colleagues in the Asian context (Benninger 2001). They form the elements of the planning curriculum at the School of Planning, [[Ahmedabad]], which Benninger founded in 1971.  They were the basis for the new capital plan for [[Thimphu]], [[Bhutan]].&lt;ref name=Thimphu&gt;[http://www.dudh.gov.bt/Thimphustructural/Index.html Thimphu Structural Plan 2002-2027] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623013525/http://www.dudh.gov.bt/Thimphustructural/Index.html |date=2010-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Axioms==
===Principle one: a balance with nature===
According to proponents of intelligent urbanism, balance with nature emphasizes the distinction between utilizing resources and exploiting them.  It focuses on the thresholds beyond which [[deforestation]], [[soil erosion]], [[aquifer]] depletion, [[silting|siltation]] and flooding reinforce one another in urban development, saving or destroying life support systems.  The principle promotes environmental assessments to identify fragile zones, threatened [[ecosystems]] and habitats that can be enhanced through conservation, density control, [[land use planning]] and [[Urban open space|open space]] design (McCarg: 1975). This principle promotes life cycle building energy consumption and pollutant emission analysis.&lt;ref&gt;McHarg I. (1975): Design with Nature, Wiley, John and Sons, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle states there is a level of human habitation intensity wherein the resources that are consumed will be replaced through the replenishing natural cycles of the seasons, creating environmental equilibrium.  Embedded in the principle is  contention that so long as nature can resurge each year; so long as the biomass can survive within its own [[eco-system]]; so long as the breeding grounds of fauna and avifauna are safe; so long as there is no erosion and the biomass is maintained, nature is only being utilized.

Underlying this principle is the supposition that there is a fragile line that is crossed when the [[fauna]], which cross-fertilizes the [[flora]], which sustains the soil, which supports the hillsides, is no longer there. Erosion, siltation of drainage networks and flooding result. After a point of no return, utilization of [[natural resources]] will outpace the natural ability of the [[Ecosystem|eco-system]] to replenish itself.  From there on degradation accelerates and amplifies.  [[Deforestation]], [[desertification]], [[erosion]], floods, fires and landslides all increase.

The principle states that blatant "acts against nature" include cutting of hillside trees, [[quarry]]ing on slopes, dumping [[sewage]] and [[industrial waste]] into the natural [[drainage basin|drainage system]], paving and plinthing excessively, and construction on steep slopes.   This [[urban theory]] proposes that the urban ecological balance can be maintained when fragile areas are reserved, conservation of eco-systems is pursued, and low intensity habitation precincts are thoughtfully identified.  Thus, the principles operate within the balance of nature, with a goal of protecting and conserving those elements of the ecology that nurture the environment.  Therefore, the first principle of intelligent urbanism is that urbanization be in balance with nature.

===Principle two: a balance with tradition===
Balance with tradition is intended to integrate plan interventions with existing cultural assets, respecting traditional practices and precedents of style (Spreiregen: 1965). This urban planning principle demands respect for the [[cultural heritage]] of a place.  It seeks out traditional wisdom in the layout of human settlements, in the order of building plans, in the precedents of style, in the symbols and signs that transfer meanings through decoration and motifs.  This principle respects the order engendered into building systems through years of adaptation to climate, to social circumstances, to available materials and to technology.  It promotes [[architectural styles]] and motifs designed to communicate cultural values.

This principle calls for orienting attention toward historic monuments and heritage structures, leaving space at the ends of visual axis to “frame" existing views and vistas. Natural views and vistas demand respect, assuring that buildings do not block major sight lines toward visual assets.

Embedded in the principle is the concern for unique cultural and societal iconography of regions, their signs and symbols. Their incorporation into the spatial order of urban settings is promoted.  Adherents promote the orientation and structuring of urban plans using local knowledge and meaning systems, expressed through art, urban space and architecture.

Planning decisions must operate within the balance of tradition, aggressively protecting, promoting and conserving generic components and elements of the urban pattern.

===Principle three: appropriate technology===
[[Appropriate technology]] emphasizes the employment of [[building materials]], construction techniques, infrastructural systems and [[project management]] which are consistent with local contexts (situation, setting or circumstances)[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/contexts]. People's capacities, geo-climatic conditions, locally available resources, and suitable [[investment|capital investments]] all temper technology. Where there are abundant craftspeople, labour-intensive methods are appropriate. Where there is surplus savings, capital intensive methods are appropriate. For every problem there is a range of potential technologies, which can be applied, and an appropriate fit between technology and other resources must be established. Proponents argue that accountability and transparency are enhanced by overlaying the physical spread of urban utilities and services upon electoral constituencies, such that people’s representatives are interlinked with the urban technical systems needed for a [[civil society]]. This principle is in sync with "small is beautiful" concepts and with the use of local resources.

===Principle four: conviviality===
The fourth principle  sponsors [[social interaction]] through public domains, in a hierarchy of places, devised for personal solace, companionship, romance, domesticity, "neighborliness," community and civic life (Jacobs:1993). According to proponents of intelligent urbanism, vibrant societies are interactive, socially engaging and offer their members numerous opportunities for gathering and meeting one another.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs Jane (1993): [[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]], [[Random House]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  The PIU maintain that this can be achieved through design and that society operates within hierarchies of [[social relation]]s which are space specific.  The hierarchies can be conceptualized as a system of social tiers, with each tier having a corresponding physical place in the settlement structure.

====A place for the individual====
A goal of intelligent urbanism is to create places of solitude. These may be in urban forests, along urban hills, beside quiet streams, in public gardens and in parks where one can escape to meditate and contemplate.  According to proponents, these are the quiet places wherein the individual consciousness dialogues with the rational mind.  Idle and random thought sorts out complexities of modern life and allows the obvious to emerge.  It is in these natural settings that the wandering mind finds its measure and its balance. Using ceremonial gates, directional walls and other “silent devices" these spaces are denoted and divined.  Places of the individual cultivate introspection.  These spaces may also be the forecourts and interior courtyards of public buildings, or even the thoughtful reading rooms of libraries. Meditation focuses one's thought.  Intelligent urbanism creates a domain for the individual to mature through self-analysis and [[self-realization]].

====A place for friendship====
The axiom insists that in city plans there must be spaces for “beautiful, intimate [[friendship]]" where unfettered dialogue can happen.  This principle insists that such places will not exist naturally in a modern urban fabric.  They must be a part of the conscientious design of the urban core, of the urban hubs, of urban villages and of neighborhoods, where people can meet with friends and talk out life’s issues, sorrows, joys and dilemmas.  This second tier is important for the emotional life of the populace.  It sponsors strong [[mental health]] within the people, creating places where friendship can unfold and grow.

====A place for householders====
There must be spaces for householders, which may be in the form of dwellings for families, or homes for intimate companions, and where young workmates can form a common kitchen.  Whatever their compositions, there must be a unique domain for [[Group (sociology)|social groups]], familiar or biological, which have organized themselves into households.  These domestic precincts are where families live and carry out their day-to-day functions of life.  This third tier of conviviality is where the individual socializes into a personality.

Housing clusters planned according to this axiom create a variety of household possibilities, which respond to a range of household structures and situations.  It recognizes that households transform through the years, requiring a variety of dwellings types that respond to a complex matrix of needs and abilities, which are provided for in city plans.

====A place for the neighborhood====
Smaller household domains must cluster into a higher social domain, the neighborhood social group.
Good city planning practice sponsors, through design, such units of social space.  It is in this fourth tier of social life that public conduct takes on new dimensions and groups learn to live peacefully among one another.  It is through neighborhoods that the “social contract" amongst diverse households and individuals is sponsored.  This [[social contract]] is the rational basis for social relations and negotiations within larger social groups. Within neighborhoods basic amenities like creches, early learning centers, preventive health care and rudimentary infrastructure are maintained by the community.

====A place for communities====
The next social tier, or hierarchy, is the community.  Historically, communities were tribes who shared [[Mores|social mores]] and cultural behavioral patterns.  In contemporary urban settings communities are formed of diverse people.  But these are people who share the common need to negotiate and manage their spatial settings. In plans created through the principles of intelligent urbanism these are called urban villages.  Like a rural village, social bonds are found in the [[community management]] of security, common resources and social space. Urban villages will have defined social spaces, services and amenities that need to be managed by the community.  According to proponents of intelligent urbanism these urban villages optimally become the administrative wards, and therefore the constituencies, of the elected members of municipal bodies.  Though there are no physical barriers to these communities, they have their unique spatial social domain.  Intelligent urbanism calls for the creation of dense, walkable zones in which the inhabitants recognize each other’s faces, share common facilities and resources, and often see each other at the village centre. This fifth tier of social space is where one needs initiative to join into various activities.  It is intended to promote initiative and constructive community participation.  There are opportunities for one to be involved in the management of services, and amenities and to meet new people. They accommodate primary education and recreation areas. Good planning practice promotes the creation of community places, where community-based organizations can manage common resources and resolve common problems.

====A place for the city domain====
The principles of intelligent urbanism call for city level domains.  These can be plazas, parks, stadia, transport hubs, promenades, "passages" or gallerias.  These are social spaces where everyone can go.  In many cities one has to pay an entrance fee to access “public spaces" like malls and museums.  Unlike the lower tiers of the [[social hierarchy]], this tier is not defined by any biological, familiar, [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] or exclusive characteristic.  One may find people from all continents, from nearby districts and provinces and from all parts of the city in such places. By nature these are accessible and open spaces, with no physical, social or economic barriers. According to this principle it is the rules of human conduct that order this domain’s behavior.  It is civility, or civilization, which protects and energizes such spaces.  At the lower tiers, one meets people through introductions, through family ties, and through neighborhood circumstances.

These domains would include all freely accessible large spaces. These are places where outdoor exhibits are held, sports matches take place, vegetables are sold and goods are on display. These are places where visitors to the city meander amongst the locals. Such places may stay the same, but the people are always changing.  Most significant, these city scale public domains foster public interaction; they sponsor unspoken ground rules for unknown people to meet and to interact.  They nurture civic understanding of the strength of diversity, variety, a range of cultural groups and ethnic mixes. It is this higher tier of social space which defines truly urbane environments.

Every [[Social structure|social system]] has its own hierarchy of social relations and interactions. Intelligent urbanism sees cyberspace as a macro tier of conviviality, but does not discount physical places in forging relationships due to the Internet. These are reflected through a system of ‘places’ that respond to them.  Good urban planning practice promotes the planning and design of such ‘places’ as elemental components of the [[urban structure]].

===Principle five: efficiency===
The principle of efficiency promotes a balance between the consumption of resources such as energy, time and fiscal resources, with planned achievements in comfort, safety, security, access, tenure, productivity and hygiene.  It encourages optimum sharing of public land, roads, facilities, services and infrastructural networks, reducing per household costs, while increasing affordability, productivity, access and civic viability.

Intelligent urbanism promotes a balance between performance and consumption.  Intelligent urbanism promotes efficiency in carrying out functions in a [[Cost-effectiveness|cost effective]] manner. It assesses the performance of various systems required by the public and the consumption of energy, funds, administrative time and the maintenance efforts required to perform these functions.

A major concern of this principle is transport.  While recognizing the convenience of personal vehicles, it attempts to place costs (such as [[Fuel efficiency in transportation|energy consumption]], large paved areas, parking, accidents, negative [[balance of trade]], pollution and related morbidity) on the users of private vehicles.

Good city planning practice promotes alternative modes of transport, as opposed to a dependence on personal vehicles.  It promotes affordable [[public transport]].  It promotes medium to high-density [[residential development]] along with complementary social amenities, convenience shopping, recreation and [[public services]] in compact, walkable mixed-use settlements.  These compact communities have shorter pipe lengths, wire lengths, cable lengths and road lengths per capita.  More people share gardens, shops and transit stops.&lt;ref&gt;Urban Land Institute (1998): Smart Growth, [[Urban Land Institute]], Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

These compact urban nodes are spaced along regional urban transport corridors that integrate the region’s urban nodes, through public transport, into a rational system of growth.  Good planning practice promotes clean, comfortable, safe and speedy, public transport, which operates at dependable intervals along major origin and destination paths.  Such a system is cheaper, safer, less polluting and consumes less energy.

The same principle applies to [[public infrastructure]], social facilities and public services.  Compact, high-density communities result in more efficient urban systems, delivering services at less cost per unit to each citizen.

There is an appropriate balance to be found somewhere on the line between wasteful low-density individual systems and over-capitalized mega systems.  Individual [[septic tank]]s and water bores servicing individual households in low-density fragmented layouts, allow the use of filtered [[greywater]] for free [[irrigation]] of gardens, but, if not maintained, can cause a local pollution of subterranean [[aquifer]] systems. The bores can dramatically lower [[Groundwater|ground water]] levels especially during droughts. The vantage of septic tanks an bores is to be managed by the very users, at no cost for the community.
Alternatively, large-scale, citywide sewerage systems and regional [[water supply]] systems are capital intensive and prone to management and maintenance dysfunction, if not corruption or extortion by private companies.  Operating costs, [[user fees]] and cost recovery expenses are high.   There is a balance wherein medium-scale systems, covering compact communities, utilize modern technology, without the pitfalls of large-scale infrastructure systems.  This principle of urbanism promotes the middle path with regard to public infrastructure, facilities, services and amenities.

When these appropriate facilities and service systems overlap electoral constituencies, the “imagery" between user performance in the form of payments for services, systems dependability through managed delivery, and official response through effective representation, should all become obvious and transparent.

Good city planning practices promote compact settlements along dense urban corridors, and within populated networks, such that the numbers of users who share costs are adequate to support effective and efficient infrastructure systems. Intelligent urbanism is intended to foster movement on foot, linking pedestrian movement with public transport systems at strategic nodes and hubs.  Medium-scale infrastructural systems, whose catchment areas overlap political constituencies and administrative jurisdictions, result in transparent governance and accountable urban management.

===Principle six: human scale===
Intelligent urbanism encourages ground level, pedestrian oriented urban patterns, based on anthropometric dimensions.  Walkable, mixed use urban villages are encouraged over single-function blocks, linked by motor ways, and surrounded by [[parking lot]]s.

An abiding axiom of urban planning, [[urban design]] and city planning has been the promotion of people friendly places, pedestrian walkways and public domains where people can meet freely.  These can be parks, gardens, glass-covered gallerias, arcades, courtyards, street side cafes, river- and hill-side stroll ways, and a variety of semi-covered spaces.

Intelligent urbanism promotes the scale of the pedestrian moving on the pathway, as opposed to the scale of the automobile on the expressway.  Intelligent urbanism promotes the ground plan of imaginable precincts, as opposed to the imagery of façades and the monumentality of the section.  It promotes the personal visibility of places moving on foot at eye level.

Intelligent urbanism advocates removing artificial barrier and promotes face-to-face contact.  Proponents argue that the automobile, [[Single-use zoning|single use zoning]] and the construction of public structures in isolated compounds, all deteriorate [[Human condition|the human condition]] and the human scale of the city.

According to PIU proponents, the trend towards [[urban sprawl]] can be overcome by developing pedestrian circulation networks along streets and open spaces that link local destinations.  Shops, amenities, [[day care]], vegetable markets and basic social services should be clustered around public transport stops, and at a walkable distance from work places, public institutions, high and medium density residential areas.  Public spaces should be integrated into residential, work, entertainment and commercial areas.  Social activities and public buildings should orient onto public open spaces.  These should be the interchange sites for people on the move, where they can also revert into the realm of “slowness," of community life and of human interaction.

Human scale can be achieved through building masses that “step down" to human scale open spaces; by using arcades and pavilions as buffers to large masses; by intermixing open spaces and built masses sensitively; by using [[anthropometric]] proportions and [[natural material]]s.  Traditional building precedents often carry within them a human scale language, from which a contemporary fabric of build may evolve.

The focus of intelligent urbanism is the ground plane, pedestrian movement and interaction along movement channels, stems, at crossing nodes, at interactive hubs and within vibrant urban cores.  The PIU holds many values in common with [[Transit-oriented development|Transit Oriented Development]], but the PIU goal is not merely to replace the automobile, nor to balance it.  These are mundane requirements of planning, which the PIU assumes are found in every design and urban configuration. The PIU goal is to enrich the human condition and to enhance the realm of human possibilities.

Intelligent urbanism conceives of urbanity as a process of facilitating [[human behavior]] toward more tolerant, more peaceful, more accommodating and more sensitive modalities of interaction and [[conflict resolution]].  Intelligent urbanism recognizes that ‘urbanity’ emerges where people mix and interact on a face-to-face basis, on the ground, at high densities and amongst diverse social and economic groups. Intelligent urbanism nurtures ‘urbanity’ through designs and plans that foster human scale interaction.

===Principle seven: opportunity matrix===
The PIU envisions the city as a vehicle for personal, social, and [economic development], through access to a range of organizations, services, facilities and information providing a variety of opportunities for enhanced employment, economic engagement, education, and recreation. This principle aims to increase access to shelter, health care and human resources development. It aims to increase safety and hygienic conditions. The city is a place of economic opportunity. This is generally said with regard to urban annual net product, enriched urban economic base, sustained employment generation and urban balance of trade.  More significantly this is true for the individuals who settle in cities.  Moreover, cities are places where individuals can increase their knowledge, skills and sensitivities.  Cities provide access to [[health care]] and [[preventive medicine]].  They provide a great umbrella of services under which the individual can leave aside the struggle for survival, and get on with the finer things of life.&lt;ref&gt;Sen A. (2000): Development as Freedom: Knopf, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The PIU sees cities as catalysts for personal definition and self-discovery. In cities people get inspired, build a drive to achieve, discover aspects of their personalities, skills and intellectual curiosity which they use to craft their identity.

The city provides a range of services and facilities, whose realization in villages are the all-consuming struggle of rural inhabitants.  Potable water; sewerage management; energy for cooking, heat and lighting are all piped and wired in; [[Waste management|solid waste disposal]] and [[Stormwater|storm water]] drainage are taken for granted.  The city offers access through roads, public transit, telephones and the Internet.  The peace and security provided by effective policing systems, and the courts of law, are just assumed to be there in the city.  Then there are the schools, the recreation facilities, the health services and a myriad of professional services offered in the city market place.

Intelligent urbanism views the city as an opportunity system.  Yet these opportunities are not equally distributed.  Security, health care, education, shelter, hygiene, and most of all employment, are not equally accessible.  Proponents of intelligent urbanism see the city as playing an equalizing role allowing citizens to grow according to their own essential capabilities and efforts.  If the city is an institution, which generates opportunities, intelligent urbanism promotes the concept of equal access to opportunities within the urban system.

Intelligent urbanism promotes a guaranteed access to education, health care, police protection, and justice before the law, potable water, and a range of basic services.  Perhaps this principle, more than any other, distinguishes intelligent urbanism from other elitist, efficiency oriented urban charters and regimes.

Intelligent urbanism does not say every household will stay in an equivalent house, or travel in the same vehicle, or consume the same amount of electricity.

Intelligent urbanism recognizes the existence of poverty, of ignorance, of ill health, of malnutrition, of low skills, of gender bias and ignorance of the urban system itself.  Intelligent urbanism is courageous in confronting these forms of inequality, and backlogs in social and economic development.  Intelligent urbanism sees an urban plan, not only as a physical plan, but also as a social plan and as an economic plan.

The ramifications of this understanding are that the people living in [[smart city|intelligent cities]] should not experience urban development in “standard doses".   In short, people may be born equal or unequal, but they grow inequitably.  An important role of the city is to provide a variety of paths and channels for each individual to set right their own future, against the inequity of their past, or the special challenges they face.  According to proponents of this principle this is the most salient aspect of a [[free society]]; than even [[Suffrage|voting rights]] access to opportunity is the essence of self-liberation and human development (Sen:2000).

According to proponents of intelligent urbanism, there will be a variety of problems faced by urbanites and they need a variety of opportunity channels for resolution.  If there are ten problem areas where people are facing stresses, like economic engagement, health, shelter, food, education, recreation, transport, etc., there must be a variety of opportunities through which individuals and households can resolve each of these stresses.  There must be ten channels to resolve each of ten stresses! If this opportunity matrix is understood and responded to, the city is truly functioning as an opportunity matrix. For example, opportunities for shelter could be through the channels of lodges, rented rooms, studio apartments, bedroom apartments and houses.  It could be through the channels of ownership, through a variety of tendencies.  It could be through opportunities for [[self-help]], or incremental housing.  It could be through the up-gradation of slums.  Intelligent urbanism promotes a wide range of solutions, where any stress is felt.  It therefore promotes a range of problem statements, options, and variable solutions to urban stresses.

Intelligent urbanism sees cities as processes.  Proponents argue that good urban plans facilitate those processes and do not place barriers before them.  For example, it does not judge a “slum" as a blight on society; it sees the possibility that such a settlement may be an opportunity channel for entry into the city.  Such a settlement may be the only affordable shelter, within easy access to employment and education, for a new immigrant household in the city.  According to intelligent urbanism, if the plan ignores, or destroys such settlements, it is creating a city of barriers and despair wherein a poor family, offering a good service to the city, is denied a modicum of basic needs for survival.  Alternatively, if the urban plan recognizes that the “slum" is a mechanism for [[Personal development|self development]], a spring-board from which children have access to education, a place which can be up-graded with potable water, basic sanitary facilities, [[street light]]s and paving…then it is a plan for opportunity.  Intelligent urbanism believes that there are slums of hope and slums of despair.  It promotes slums of hope, which contribute, not only to individual opportunities, but also to [[Nation-building|nation building]].

The opportunity matrix must also respond to young professionals, to skilled, well-paid [[day labor]]ers, to the [[upper middle class]] and to affluent entrepreneurs.   If a range of needs, of abilities to pay, of locational requirements, and of levels of development of shelter, is addressed, then opportunities are being created.

Intelligent urbanism believes that [[Capitalism|private enterprise]] is the logical provider of opportunities, but that alone it will not be just or effective.  The regime of land, left to [[Market Forces|market forces]] alone, will create an exclusive, dysfunctional society.  Intelligent urbanism believes that there is an essential role for the [[civil society]] to intervene in the opportunity matrix of the city.

Intelligent urbanism promotes opportunities through access to:

* Basic and primary education, skill development and knowledge about the  urban world;
* Basic health care, potable water, solid waste disposal and hygiene;
* Urban facilities like storm drainage, street lights, roads and footpaths;
* Recreation and entertainment;
* Transport, energy, communications;
* [[Public participation]] and debate;
* Finance and investment mechanisms;
* Land and/or built-up space where [[goods and services]] can be produced;
* Rudimentary economic infrastructure;
* Intelligent urbanism provides a wide range of zones, districts and precincts where activities and functions can occur without detracting from one another.

Intelligent urbanism proposes that enterprise can only flourish where a public framework provides opportunities for enterprise.  This system of opportunities operates through public investments in economic and social infrastructure; through incentives in the form of appropriate finance, tax inducements, subsidized skill development for workers, and: regulations which protect the environment, safety, hygiene and health. To ensure a stable playing field where one can make an investment with predictable returns, a modicum of regulation is necessary. Proponents argue that it is through government regulations that private investment can be protected from fraud. It is through government regulation that the under-pinning conditions for [[free enterprise]] can be protected.

===Principle eight: regional integration===
Intelligent urbanism envisions the city as an organic part of a larger environmental, [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] and cultural-geographic system, essential for its sustainability. This zone of influence is the region.  Likewise, it sees the region as integrally connected to the city.  Intelligent urbanism sees the planning of the city and its hinterland as a single holistic process.  Proponents argue if one does not recognize growth as a regional phenomenon, then development will play a [[hopscotch]] game of moving just a bit further along an arterial roads, further up valleys above the municipal jurisdiction,  staying beyond the path of the city boundary, development regulations and of the urban tax regime.

The region may be defined as the [[drainage basin|catchment area]] from which employees and students commute into the city on a daily basis. It is the catchment area from which people choose to visit one city, as opposed to another, for retail shopping and entertainment. Economically the city region may include the hinterland that depends on its wholesale markets, banking facilities, transport hubs and information exchanges. The region needing integration may be seen as the zone from which perishable foods, firewood and building materials supply the city.  The economic region can also be defined as the area managed by exchanges in the city.  Telephone calls to the region go through the city's telecom exchange; post goes through the city's general [[post office]]; money transfers go through the city’s [[financial institution]]s and internet data passes electronically through the city’s servers.  The area over which “city exchanges" disperse matter can well be called the city’s economic hinterland or region.  Usually the region includes dormitory communities, airports, water reservoirs, perishable food farms, hydro facilities, out-of-doors recreation and other infrastructure that serves the city.   Intelligent urbanism sees the integrated planning of these services and facilities as part of the city planning process.

Intelligent urbanism understands that the social and economic region linked to a city also has a physical form, or a geographic character.   A hierarchy of watersheds, creating valleys and defining edges of neighborhoods, may define the geographic character.  Forest ranges, fauna and avifauna habitats are set within such regions and are connected by natural corridors for movement and cross-fertilization.  Within this larger, environmental scenario, one must conceptualize urbanism in terms of watersheds, subterranean aquifer systems, and other natural systems that operate across the entire region.  Economic infrastructure, such as roads, hydro basins, irrigation channels, water reservoirs and related distribution networks usually follow the terrain of the [[regional geography]].  The region’s geographic portals, and lines of control, may also define defense and security systems deployment.

Intelligent urbanism recognizes that there is always a spillover of population from the city into the region, and that population in the region moves into the city for work, shopping, entertainment, health care and education.  With thoughtful planning the region can take pressure off of the city.  Traditional and new settlements within the urban region can be enhanced and densified to accommodate additional urban households.  There are many activities within the city, which are growing and are incompatible with urban habitat.  Large, noisy and polluting workshops and manufacturing units are amongst these.  Large wholesale markets, storage sheds, vehicular maintenance garages, and waste management facilities need to be housed outside of the city’s limits in their own satellite enclaves. In larger urban agglomerations a number of towns and cities are clustered around a major  urban center forming a metropolitan region.

Intelligent urbanism is not just planning for the present; it is also planning for the distant future.  Intelligent urbanism is not Utopian, but futuristic in its need to forecast the scenarios to come, within its own boundaries, and within the boundaries of the distant future.

===Principle nine: balanced movement===
Intelligent urbanism advocates integrated transport systems comprising walkways, cycle paths, bus lanes, light rail corridors, under-ground metros and automobile channels. A balance between appropriate modes of movement  is proposed. More capital intensive transport systems should move between high density nodes and hubs, which interchange with lower technology movement options. These modal split nodes become the public domains around which cluster high density, pedestrian, mixed-use urban villages (Taniguchi:2001).

The PIU accepts that the automobile is  here to stay, but that it should not be made essential by design. A well planned metropolis would densify along mass transit corridors and around major urban hubs. Smaller, yet dense, urban nodes are seen as micro-zones of medium level density, public amenities and pedestrian access. At these points lower level nodal split will occur, such as between bus loops and cycle tracts. The PIU views nodal split points as places of urban conviviality and access to services and facilities. Modal split can be between walking, cycling, driving, and mass transit. Bus loops may feed larger rail-based rapid-movement corridors. Social and economic infrastructure becomes more intensive as movement corridors become more intense.

===Principle ten: institutional integrity===
Intelligent urbanism holds that good practices inherent in considered principles can only be realized through accountable, transparent, competent and participatory local governance, founded on appropriate data bases, due entitlements, civic responsibilities and duties. The PIU promotes a range of facilitative and promotive urban development management tools to achieve appropriate urban practices, systems and forms(Islam:2000). None of the principles or practices the PIU promotes can be implemented unless there is a strong and rational institutional framework to define, channel and legalize urban development, in all of its aspects. Intelligent urbanism envisions the institutional framework as being very clear about the rules and regulations it sponsors and that those using discretion in implementing these measures must do so in a totally open, recorded and transparent manner.

Intelligent urbanism facilitates the public in carrying out their honest objectives.  It does not regulate and control the public.  It attempts to reduce the requirements, steps and documentation required for citizens to process their proposals.

Intelligent urbanism is also promotive in furthering the interests of the public in their genuine utilization of opportunities.  It promotes site and services schemes for households who can construct their own houses.  It promotes up-gradation of settlements with inadequate basic services.  It promotes innovative financing to a range of actors who can contribute to the city’s development.  Intelligent urbanism promotes a limited role for government, for example in “packaging" large-scale urban development schemes, so that the private sector is promoted to actually build and market urban projects, which were previously built by the government.

Intelligent urbanism does not consider itself naïve.  It recognizes that there are developers and promoters who have no long term commitment to their own constructions, and their only concern is to hand over a dwelling, gain their profit and move on.  For these players it is essential to have [[Development Control]] Regulations, which assure the public that the products they invest in are safe, hygienic, orderly, durable and efficient.  For the discerning citizen, such rules also lay out the civil understanding by which a [[complex society]] agrees to live together.

The PIU contends that there must be a cadastral System wherein all of the land in the jurisdiction of cities is demarcated, surveyed, characterized and archived, registering its legal owner, its legal uses, and the tax defaults against it.

The institutional framework can only operate where there is a Structure Plan, or other document that defines how the land will be used, serviced, and accessed.  The Structure Plan tells landowners and promoters what the parameters of development are, which assures that their immediate investments are secure, and that the returns and use of such efforts are predictable.   A Structure Plan is intended to provide owners and investors with predictable future scenarios.  Cities require efficient patterns for their main infrastructure systems and utilities.  According to PIU proponents, land needs to be used in a judicious manner, organizing complementary functions and activities into compact, mixed use precincts and separating out non-compatible uses into their own precincts.   In a similar manner, proponents argue it is only through a plan that heritage sites and the environment can be legally protected.  Public assets in the form of nature, religious places, heritage sites and open space systems must be designated in a legal plan.

Intelligent urbanism proposes that the city and its surrounding region be regulated by a Structure Plan, or equivalent mechanism, which acts as a [[legal instrument]] to guide the growth, development and enhancement of the city.

According to proponents, there must be a system of participation by the “Stake Holders" in the preparation of plans.  Public meetings, hearings of objections and transparent processes of addressing objections, must be institutionalized.  Intelligent urbanism promotes Public Participation.  Local Area Plans must be prepared which address local issues and take into account local views and sentiments regarding plan objectives, configurations, standards and patterns.  Such plans lay out the sites of plots showing the roads, public open spaces, amenities areas and conservation sites.  Land Pooling assures the beneficiaries from provision of public infrastructure and amenities proportionally contribute and that a few individuals do not suffer from reservations in the plan.

According to proponents, there must be a system of Floor Area Ratios to assure that the land and the services are not over pressured.  No single plot owner should have more than the determined "fair share" of utilization of the access roads, amenities and utilities that service all of the sites.  Floor Area Ratios temper this relationship as regulated the manner in which public services are consumed.  According to PIU proponents, [[Air rights|Transfer of Development Rights]] benefits land owners whose properties have been reserved under the plan.  It also benefits the local authorities that lack the financial resources to purchase lands to implement the [[Structure Plans]].  It benefits concentrated, [[Central business district|city center]] project promoters who have to amortize expensive land purchases, by allowing them to purchase the development rights from the owners of reserved lands and to hand over those properties to the plan implementing authority.  This allows the local authority to widen roads and to implement the Structure Plan.  The local authority then transfers the needed development right to city center promoters.

Intelligent urbanism supports the use of Architectural Guidelines where there is a tradition to preserve and where precedents can be used to specify architectural elements, motifs and language in a manner, which intended to reinforce a cultural tradition.  Building designs must respect traditional elements, even though the components may vary greatly to integrate contemporary functions. Even in a greenfield setting Architectural Guidelines are required to assure harmony and continuity of building proportions, scale, color, patterns, motifs, materials and facades.

Intelligent urbanism insists on safety, hygiene, durability and utility in the design and construction of buildings.  Where large numbers of people gather in schools, hospitals, and other  public facilities that may become [[emergency shelter]]s in disasters, special care must be exercised.  A suitable [[Building code|Building Code]] is the proposed instrument to achieve these aims.

PIU proponents state that those who design buildings must be professionally qualified architects; those who design the structures (especially of more than ground plus two levels) must be professionally qualified structural engineers; those who build buildings must be qualified civil engineers; and, those who supervise and control construction must be qualified construction managers.  Intelligent urbanism promotes the professionalisation of the city making process.  While promoting professionalism, intelligent urbanism proposes that this not become a barrier in the development process.  Small structures, low-rise structures, and humble structures that do not house many people can be self designed and constructed by the inhabitants themselves.  Proponents maintain that there must be recognized Professional Accrediting Boards, or Professional Bodies, to see that urban development employs adequate technical competence.

Finally, there must be legislation creating statutory [[Local government|local authorities]], and empowering them to act, manage, invest, service, protect, promote and facilitate urban development and all of the opportunities that a modern city must sponsor.

Intelligent urbanism insists that cities, local authorities, regional development commissions and planning agencies be professionally managed.  City Managers can be hired to manage the delivery of services, the planning and management of planned development, the maintenance of utilities and the creation of amenities.

Intelligent urbanism views plans and urban designs and housing configurations as expressions of the people for whom they are planned.  The processes of planning must therefore be a participatory involving a range of stakeholders.  The process must be a transparent one, which makes those privileged to act as guardians of the people’s will accountable for their decisions and choices.  Intelligent urbanism sees urban planning and city governance as the most salient expressions of civility.  Intelligent urbanism fosters the evolution of institutional systems that enhance transparency, accountability and rational public decision making.

==Movements implementing the ten principles==
Though not necessarily related to the principles of intelligent urbanism, there are examples representing all or some of them in urban design theory and practice.
Concurrently, the recent movements of [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical Architecture]] promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.org/charter Charter of the New Urbanism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|globally uniform]] architecture, as well as leaning against solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities]. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Both trends started in the 1980s. The [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] is an award that recognizes efforts in New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture, and is endowed with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref name="Driehaus Prize"&gt;{{cite web|title=Driehaus Prize|url=http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/|work=''Together, the $200,000 Driehaus Prize and the $50,000 Reed Award represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment.''|publisher=Notre Dame School of Architecture|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proto-Cubism''' (also referred to as '''Protocubism''', '''Pre-Cubism''' or '''Early Cubism''') is an intermediary transition phase in the [[history of art]] chronologically extending from 1906 to 1910. Evidence suggests that the production of proto-Cubist paintings resulted from a wide-ranging series of experiments, circumstances, influences and conditions, rather than from one isolated static event, trajectory, artist or discourse. With its roots stemming from at least the late 19th century this period can be characterized by a move towards the radical geometrization of form and a reduction or limitation of the color palette (in comparison with [[Fauvism]]). It is essentially the first experimental and exploratory phase of an [[art movement]] that would become altogether more extreme, known from the spring of 1911 as [[Cubism]].

Proto-Cubist artworks typically depict objects in geometric schemas of cubic or conic shapes. The illusion of classical [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] is progressively stripped away from objective representation to reveal the constructive essence of the physical world (not just as seen). The term is applied not only to works of this period by [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]], but to a range of art produced in France during the early 1900s, by such artists as [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Fernand Léger]], and to variants developed elsewhere in Europe. Proto-Cubist works embrace many disparate styles, and would affect diverse individuals, groups and movements, ultimately forming a fundamental stage in the history of [[modern art]] of the [[20th-century art|20th-century]].&lt;ref name="Christopher Green"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and influences==
The building blocks that lead to the construction of proto-Cubist works are diverse in nature. Neither homogeneous nor isotropic, the progression of each individual artist was unique. The influences that characterize this transition period range from [[Post-Impressionism]], to [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Les Nabis]] and [[Neo-Impressionism]], the works of [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Georges Seurat]], [[Paul Gauguin]] to [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]], [[Egypt]]ian, [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Micronesia]]n, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], [[Iberian sculpture]], and [[Iberian schematic art]].

In anticipation of Proto-Cubism the idea of form inherent in art since the [[Renaissance]] had been questioned. The [[Romanticism|romanticist]] [[Eugène Delacroix]], the [[Realism (arts)|realist]] [[Gustave Courbet]], and practically all the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] had abandoned a significant portion of [[Classicism]] in favor of ''immediate sensation''. The ''dynamic'' expression favored by these artists presented a challenge in contrast to the ''static'' means of expression promoted by the Academia. The representation of fixed objects occupying a space, was replaced by dynamic colors and form in constant evolution. Yet other means would be necessary to jettison completely the long-standing foundation that surrounded them. While the freedom of Impressionism had certainly jeopardized its integrity, it would take another generation of artists, not just to bring the edifice down piece by piece, but to rebuild an entirely new configuration, ''cube by cube''.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann"&gt;[http://cubism-coldcreation.blogspot.com/ Alex Mittelmann, ''State of the Modern Art World, The Essence of Cubism and its Evolution in Time'', 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cézanne===
[[File:Paul Cézanne, 1888, Mardi gras (Pierrot et Arlequin), oil on canvas, 102 x 81 cm, Pushkin Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Cézanne]], 1888, ''Mardi gras (Pierot and Harlequin)'', oil on canvas, {{convert|102|x|81|cm|in|abbr=on}}, [[Pushkin Museum]], Moscow]]
Several predominant factors mobilized the shift from a more representational art form to one that would become increasingly abstract; one of the most important would be found directly within the works of [[Paul Cézanne]] and exemplified in a widely discussed letter addressed to [[Émile Bernard]] dated 15 April 1904. Cézanne ambiguously writes: "Interpret nature in terms of the cylinder, the sphere, the cone; put everything in perspective, so that each side of an object, of a plane, recedes toward a central point."&lt;ref name="Erle Lora"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vpbEHESVx9cC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Cézanne,+le+cylindres,+sphères,+et+le+cônes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VWN2A52aTk&amp;sig=kFqKvxXeu6Q_DgjHn2GAb6TDbFE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VpsqUenwBom3hAfVvIGADg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=cylinder%2C%20sphere%2C%20cone&amp;f=false Erle Lora, ''Cézannes Composition: Analysis of His Form with Diagrams and Photographs of His Motifs''], Forward by Richard Shiff, University of California Press, April 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his preoccupation for the simplification of geometric structure, Cézanne was concerned with the means of rendering the effect of volume and space. His rather classical color-modulating system consisted of changing colors from warm to cool as the object turns away from the source of light. Cézanne's departure from classicism, however, would be best summarized in the treatment and of application of the paint itself; a process in which his brushstrokes played an important role. The complexity of surface variations (or modulations) with overlapped shifting planes, seemingly arbitrary contours, contrasts and values combined to produce a strong patchwork effect. Increasingly in his later works, as Cézanne achieves a greater freedom, the patchwork becomes larger, bolder, more arbitrary, more dynamic and increasingly abstract. As the color planes acquire greater formal independence, defined objects and structures begin to lose their identity.&lt;ref name="Erle Lora" /&gt;

The art critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] acknowledged the importance of Cézanne to the Cubists in his article titled ''From Cézanne to Cubism'' (published in ''Eclair'', 1920). For Vauxcelles the influence had a two-fold character, both 'architectural' and 'intellectual'. He stressed the statement made by [[Émile Bernard]] that Cézanne's optics were "not in the eye, but in his brain".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Green, ''Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916-28'', Yale University Press, New Have and London, 1987, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paul Cézanne 112.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Paul Cézanne]], ca.1897, ''Mont Sainte-Victoire seen from the Bibémus Quarry'', oil on canvas, 65 x 81 cm, [[Baltimore Museum of Art]]. In order to express the mountain’s grandeur, Cézanne manipulated the scene by painting the mountain twice as large as it would have appeared, and tipped forward so that it would rise up rather than slope backwards&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artbma.org/learning%2Dfrom%2Dcezanne/downloads/cezanne%2Dmt%5Fsaint%5Fvictoire.pdf Baltimore Museum of Art, Mont Sainte-Victoire Seen from the Bibémus Quarry, c. 1897, by Paul Cézanne]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
With both his courage and experience to draw from, Cézanne created a hybrid art-form. He combined on the one hand the imitative and the ''immobile'', a system left over from the Renaissance, and the ''mobile'' on the other; together to forming a hybrid. His own generation would see in his contradictory codes nothing more than impotence, unaware of his intentions. However, the next generation would see in Cézanne greatness, precisely because of this duality. Cézanne was seen simultaneously as a classicist by those who chose to see in his work the imitation of nature and perspective, and as a revolutionary by those who saw in him a revolt against imitation and classical perspective. Timid, yet clearly manifest, was the will to deconstruct. Artists at the forefront of the Parisian art scene at the outset of the 20th century would not fail to notice these tendencies inherent in the work of Cézanne, and decided to venture still further.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert"&gt;Robert L. Herbert, 1968, ''Neo-Impressionism'', The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

Avant-garde artists in Paris (including [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[André Lhote]], [[Othon Friesz]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Alexander Archipenko]] and [[Joseph Csaky]]) had begun reevaluating their own work in relation to that of Cézanne. A retrospective of Cézanne's paintings had been held at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1904. Current works were exhibited at the Salon d'Automne of 1905 and 1906, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907. The influence generated by the work of Cézanne suggests a means by which some of these artist made the transition from [[Post-Impressionism]], [[Neo-Impressionism]], [[Divisionism]] and [[Fauvism]] to [[Cubism]].&lt;ref name="Moser"&gt;Joann Moser, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, ''Pre-Cubist Works, 1904-1909'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 34, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Cézanne syntax didn't just ripple outwards over the sphere, touching those that would become [[Cubism|Cubists]] in France, [[Futurism|Futurists]] in Italy and [[Die Brücke]], [[Der Blaue Reiter]], [[Expressionism|Expressionists]] in Germany, it also created currents that flowed throughout Parisian art world threatening to destabilize (if not topple) at least three of the core foundations of the academia: the geometrical method of perspective used to create the illusion of form, space and depth since the Renaissance; [[Figurative art|Figuratism]], derived from real object sources (and therefore [[Representation (arts)|representational]]), and [[aesthetics]]. At the time, it was assumed that all art aims at beauty, and anything that wasn't beautiful couldn't be counted as art. The proto-Cubists revolted against the concept that objective beauty was central to the definition of art.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Coleman Danto, ''The Abuse of Beauty: Aesthetics and the Concept of Art'', Open Court Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8126-9540-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8126-9540-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, ''Deleuze, [[Guattari]] and the Philosophy of Expression'', CRCL, 24:3, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism===
In his ''Sources of Cubism and Futurism'', art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]] reviews the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] roots of modern art, exploring the literary source of both [[Cubism|Cubist]] painting in France and [[Futurism]] in Italy.&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1981"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/776441?uid=3737952&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101725009653 Daniel Robbins, ''Sources of Cubism and Futurism'', Art Journal, Vol. 41, No. 4, (Winter 1981): pp. 324-27], Published by College Art Association&lt;/ref&gt; The revolution of ''free verse'' with which [[Gustave Kahn]] was associated, was a principle example of the correspondence between progress in art and politics; a growing conviction among young artists. [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] acknowledged his indebtedness to it, as a source of modern artistic liberty. "[[Paul Fort]]'s Parisian review ''Vers et Prose''", writes Robbins, "as well as the [[Abbaye de Créteil]], cradle of both [[Jules Romain (author)|Jules Romain]]'s [[Unanimism]] and [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Henri-Martin Barzun]]'s ''Dramatisme'', had emphasized the importance of this new formal device".&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1981" /&gt; Kahn's free verse was revolutionary because, in his own words, "free verse is mobile, like mobile perspective". In classical French poetry, writes Robbins, "meaning and rhythm were united, and sense and rhythm stopped simultaneously. The unity consisted in the number and rhythm of vowels and consonants together forming an organic and independent cell". The system began to break down, according to Kahn, with the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poets when they permitted a stop for the ear, with ''no'' stop in meaning. This is akin to [[Jacques Villon]]'s drawings and prints of 1908 and 1909, notes Robbins, "where the hatching lines that create a shape do not stop at the contour, but continue beyond, taking on an independent life".&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1981" /&gt;

The next step, wrote Kahn, was to impart unity and cohesion by means of a union of related consonants, or the repetition of similar vowel sounds (assonance). Poets were thus free to create novel and complex rhythms, with, if so desired, inversions that destroyed the beat of the [[strophe]]. As Kahn noted, this was shocking because traditionally it was the regularity of the strophe that gave the reader meaning. Symbolist concepts vacated the [[metronome]]-like symmetry and introduced ''liberty'', ''flexibility'' and ''elasticity''. Each was to find her own rhythmic force. The classicists feared that the dismantling of meter by the decadent Symbolist 'barbarians' would undermine the French language, and thus attack the very foundations of social order.&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1981" /&gt;

''Elasticity'', one of Kahn's favorite words used to describe free verse, would become the title of well known Futurist works by [[Umberto Boccioni]], as well as two paintings by [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], a proto-Cubist work and later a cubist work entitled ''Marie Ressort'' (''ressort'' meaning elasticity or spring). These paintings, writes Robbins, are an homage to the prose of [[Jules Laforgue]], whose poems concerned the life of his sister Marie.&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1981" /&gt;

====Pablo Picasso====
{{double image|right|El Greco, c.1609-14, The Vision of Saint John, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|190|Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|210|[[El Greco]], ''[[The Opening of the Fifth Seal]]'' (c.1609–14, oil, 224.8 × 199.4&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]) has been suggested to be the prime source of inspiration for Picasso's {{lang|fr|Les Demoiselles d'Avignon}}.|Picasso's ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907, oil on canvas, 243.9&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;233.7&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Museum of Modern Art]]) appears to have certain morphological and stylistic similarities with ''The Opening of the Fifth Seal''.||}}
In 1899 Picasso rejected academic study and joined a circle of avant-garde artists and writers known as ''[[Modernisme|modernistes]]'' or ''decadentes''. Meeting at [[Els Quatre Gats]] in [[Barcelona]], they assimilated trends such as symbolism and [[Art nouveau]], characterized by contour lines, simplified form and unnatural colors. Yet, in addition to the influence of [[Théophile Steinlen]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], that of [[Francisco Goya]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.uol.com.br/bienal/23bienal/especial/iego.htm Goya and Modernism, Bienal Internacional de São Paulo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117072537/http://www1.uol.com.br/bienal/23bienal/especial/iego.htm |date=2008-01-17 }} Retrieved 27 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[El Greco]] can be seen in Picasso's work of the period. A significant innovation of El Greco's later works is the interweaving of form and space; a reciprocal relationship is developed between the two that unifies the painted surface. This interweaving would re-emerge three centuries later in the works of [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]] and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]].&lt;ref name="Lambraki57-59"&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco'', 57–59&lt;/ref&gt; Adapting these style, the artist produced numerous portraits of friends such as [[Carlos Casagemas]] and [[Jaime Sabartes|Jaime Sabartès]] (Sabartès Seated). The modernists also devoted themselves to political anarchy and other social causes, including sympathy for the poor, denizens and the underclass; subjects that would soon emerge in the paintings of [[Picasso's Blue Period]] (a color associated with despair and melancholy, blue was commonly used in Symbolist painting).&lt;ref name="NGA, Picasso"&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/picasso.pdf ''Picasso: The Early Years, 1892-1906'', National Gallery of Art (NGA), Washington DC, Exhibition catalogue, March 30 - July 27, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;

This work has a striking resemblance to 20th-century [[Expressionism]]. Historically however it is an example of [[Mannerism]].]]
The first artist who seems to have noticed the structural code built into the morphology of late El Greco was [[Paul Cézanne]], one of the forerunners of [[Cubism]].&lt;ref name="Plaka49"&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco—The Greek'', 49&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative morphological analyses of the two painters works reveal common elements: the distortion of the human body, the reddish and unworked backgrounds, and the similarities in the rendering of space.&lt;ref name="Foundoulaki105-106"&gt;E. Foundoulaki, ''From El Greco to Cézanne'', 105–106&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brown, "Cézanne and El Greco are spiritual brothers despite the centuries which separate them".&lt;ref name="Brown28"&gt;J. Brown, ''El Greco of Toledo'', 28&lt;/ref&gt; Fry observed that Cézanne drew from "his great discovery of the permeation of every part of the design with a uniform and continuous plastic theme".&lt;ref name="Lambraki15"&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''From El Greco to Cézanne'', 15&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 Picasso moved to Paris, where the work of post-impressionist painters Van Gogh, Cézanne, Seurat, Gauguin were exhibited at galleries and Salons. Rapidly assimilating these influences, he adapted to new styles and techniques, as the use of bright unmixed colors.&lt;ref name="NGA, Picasso" /&gt;

The [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]], and [[Pablo Picasso]] during his [[Blue Period]], drew on the cool tonality of El Greco and the anatomy of his ascetic figures. While Picasso was working on {{lang|fr|[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]}}, he visited his friend [[Ignacio Zuloaga]] in his Parisian atelier and studied El Greco's ''[[Opening of the Fifth Seal]]'' (owned by Zuloaga since 1897).&lt;ref&gt;Carter .B. Horsley, [http://www.thecityreview.com/elgreco.html ''The Shock of the Old''], El Greco at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Gallery of Art. Accessed 25 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The relation between {{lang|fr|Les Demoiselles d'Avignon}} and the ''Opening of the Fifth Seal'' was pinpointed in the early 1980s, when the stylistic similarities and the relationship between the motifs of both works were analysed. Art historian Ron Johnson was the first to focus on the relationship between the two paintings. According to [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]], ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' "turns out to have a few more answers to give once we realize that the painting owes at least as much to El Greco as [[Cézanne]]".&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;J. Richardson, ''Picasso's Apocalyptic Whorehouse'', 40-47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;R. Johnson, ''Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon'', 102–113&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Picasso's Rose Period]] turns toward the theme of the fairground and circus performers; subjects often depicted in [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]], [[Romanticism|romantic]] and symbolist art and verse (from Baudelaire and Rimbaud to Daumier and Seurat), where melancholy and social alienation pervade the saltimbanque. Corresponding to the tone of Picasso, acrobats represent both mystery and enchantment in the poems of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] written in the same period.&lt;ref name="NGA, Picasso" /&gt;

In 1906, working at the Bateau Lavoir, Picasso continued to explore new directions; portraying monumental female figures standing in abstract interior spaces. Now, in addition to the bathers of Cézanne, Spanish romanesque art and Iberian sculpture provide a prominent influences for Picasso. Around this time he also created a self-portrait depicting himself as something of a latter-day Cézanne.&lt;ref name="NGA, Picasso" /&gt;

====Albert Gleizes====
[[File:L'Abbaye de Créteil.jpg|thumb|upright=1.40|[[Abbaye de Créteil]], ca.1908. First row: Charles Vildrac, René Arcos, Albert Gleizes, Barzun, Alexandre Mercereau. Second row: Georges Duhamel, Berthold Mahn, d'Otémar]]
The proto-Cubism of [[Albert Gleizes]] too bares its roots in Symbolism. In his father's Montmartre workshop (around 1899), Gleizes joins a childhood friend, the poet [[:fr:René Arcos|René Arcos]].&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/chronology Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt; In Amiens (1904) he meets the painters [[:fr:Berthold Mahn|Berthold Mahn]], Jacques d'Otémar and Josué Gaboriaud, as well as the printer, Lucien Linard, who will soon run the printshop at the [[Abbaye de Créteil]]. At the same time, through Jean Valmy Baysse, an art critic (and soon historian of the [[Comédie-Française]]) who was a friend of the Gleizes family, René Arcos is invited to participate on a new journal, ''La Vie'', in collaboration with [[Alexandre Mercereau]], [[Charles Vildrac]] and [[Georges Duhamel]].&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

In 1905 the group of writers and painters is joined by the Symbolist poet and writer [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Henri-Martin Barzun]]. Gleizes is instrumental in forming the Association [[Ernest Renan]], launched in December at the [[Théâtre Pigalle]], with the aim of countering the influence of militarist propaganda while providing the elements of a popular and secular culture. Gleizes is responsible for the ''Literary'' and ''Artistic'' section which organises street theatre and poetry readings.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

Throughout 1906, Gleizes and his associates pursue an idea proposed by Charles Vildrac of establishing of a self-supporting artists community which would enable them to develop their art free of commercial considerations. A suitable house and grounds is found in Créteil, then a small village outside Paris. The rent for the first six months is provided by Barzun through a small inheritance. In December, Gleizes and Vildrac move in.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt; At the outset of 1907 the [[Abbaye de Créteil]] consists of Gleizes, Arcos and Vildrac with his wife Rose, sister of Duhamel. Duhamel himself, like Barzun, appears intermittently. The group is joined by the musician [[:fr:Albert Doyen|Albert Doyen]], later to become known as founder of the ''Fêtes du Peuple''. [[Alexandre Mercereau]] arrives in the Spring of 1907 with a Russian wife who speaks no French. The group supports itself through the fine quality printing run by Linard and Gleizes. Occasional visitors include the painters Berthold Mahn, Jacques d'Otémar and Henri Doucet.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1909, Bords de la Marne, oil on canvas, 54 x 65 cm, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Lyon..jpg|thumb|250px|[[Albert Gleizes]], 1909, ''[[Bords de la Marne (Gleizes)|Les Bords de la Marne (The Banks of the Marne)]]'', oil on canvas, 54 x 65 cm, [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]]]]
The poets of the Abbaye, Arcos, Duhamel and Barzun, develop a distinctive style dealing in ''free verse'', with epic subjects influenced by [[Walt Whitman]], [[Emil Verhaeren]] and, especially, the French epic Symbolist poet [[:fr:René Ghil|René Ghil]]. Ghil developed his ideas on language, at first, in close relation with Symbolist poet [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]. Ghil held open evenings every Friday, attended by the members of the Abbaye.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt; The Abbaye published books by a wide variety of authors including [[:fr:Robert de Montesqiou|Robert de Montesqiou]], model for the Duc de Charlus in [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''A la recherche de temps perdu'', the Polish anarchist and art theorist [[:fr:Mecislas Goldberg|Mecislas Goldberg]], and the well-known collection of poems ''La Vie Unanime'', by [[Jules Romains]].&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt; ''La Vie Unanime'' was the result of a vision Romains had in 1903, writes Peter Brooke, "in which he had seen all the phenomena of daily life as intimately related like the different parts of a single huge beast". On the strength of its association with Romains the Abbaye de Créteil is often described as 'Unanimist'.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;
 
During the Summer of 1908 Gleizes and Mercereau organise a great ''Journée portes ouvertes'' at the Abbaye, with poetry readings, music and exhibitions. Participants included the Italian Symbolist poet, soon to be the theorist of [[Futurism]], [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], and the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. Gleizes' own painting in this period shifts from Post-Impressionism towards a fluid, linear style, with close relations to Symbolism and [[Les Nabis]].&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

When the Abbaye closed in January 1908, Gleizes moved into a studio situated in [[9th arrondissement of Paris]], rue du Delta, with his friend the painter and poet [[:fr:Henri Doucet|Henri Doucet]]. Though his subject matter is always taken from an unsentimental observation of the world, writes Brooke, 'Gleizes has a marked preference for urban and semi-urban scenes with an emphasis on human labour'. Though he often uses bright colors there is little or no interest in either Fauvism or Divisionism, the two schools that now dominate the Parisian [[Avant-garde]].&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

In 1909 Gleizes' evolution towards a more linear proto-Cubist style continues with greater emphasis on clear, simplified, construction; ''[[Bords de la Marne (Gleizes)|Les Bords de la Marne (The Banks of the Marne)]]''. At the [[Salon d'Automne]] Gleizes is impressed by the work of [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], especially his portrait of the poet [[:fr:Pierre Jean Jouve|Pierre Jean Jouve]]. Le Fauconnier's portraits and his landscapes painted in Brittany (''[[:fr:Ploumanac'h|Ploumanac'h]]'') show the intention of simplifying form similar to that of Gleizes. The two painters meet through the intermediary of Alexandre Mercereau.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

Gleizes exhibits his proto-Cubist works ''Portrait de René Arcos'' and ''[[L'Arbre, The Tree (Gleizes)|L'Arbre]]'' at the 1910 [[Salon des Indépendants]], two paintings in which the emphasis on simplified form clearly overwhelms the representational aspect of the works. The same tendency is evident in [[Jean Metzinger]]'s ''Portrait of Apollinaire'' (1909) exhibited at the same Salon. In his ''Anecdotiques'', 16 October 1911, Apollinaire writes: "I am honoured to be the first model of a Cubist painter, Jean Metzinger, for a portrait exhibited in 1910 at the Salon des Indépendants."&lt;ref name="Anecdotiques"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1132933/f46.image Guillaume Apollinaire, ''Anecdotiques'', Jean Metzinger, ''Portrait of Apollinaire'', 16 October, 1911, p. 44], Gallica, Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt; It was not only the first Cubist portrait, according to Apollinaire, but it was also the first great portrait of the poet exhibited in public, prior to others by [[Louis Marcoussis]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Mikhail Larionov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/jean-metzinger-portrait-de-guillaume-apollin-4911615-details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=4911615&amp;sid=bf281115-cf70-463b-ad5c-c027467afb4c Jean Metzinger, 1910, ''Portrait of Guillaume Apollinaire'', Christie's Paris, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Gleizes and Metzinger become seriously interested in each other's work.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

[[Jean Metzinger]]'s 1905-1906 [[Fauvism|Fauvist]]-[[Divisionism|divisionist]] technique, too, had its parallel in literature. For him, there was an emblematic alliance between the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] writers and [[Neo-Impressionism]]. Each brushstroke of color was equivalent to a word or 'syllable'. Together the cubes of pigments formed sentences or 'phrases', translating various emotions. This is an important aspect of Metzinger's early work, proto-Cubist work, and an important aspect of Metzinger's entire artistic output (as a painter, writer, poet, and theorist). Prior to the advent of Cubism Metzinger coupled Symbolist/Neo-Impressionist color theory with [[Paul Cézanne|Cézannian]] perspective, beyond not just the preoccupations of [[Paul Signac]] and [[Henri-Edmond Cross]], but beyond too the preoccupations of his avant-garde entourage.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I ask of divided brushwork not the objective rendering of light, but iridescence and certain aspects of color still foreign to painting. I make a kind of chromatic versification and for syllables I use strokes which, variable in quantity, cannot differ in dimension without modifying the rhythm of a pictorial phraseology destined to translate the diverse emotions aroused by nature." (Metzinger, 1907)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Gino Severini, 1911, La Danseuse Obsedante (The Haunting Dancer, Ruhelose Tanzerin), oil on canvas, 73.5 x 54 cm, private collection.jpg|thumb|[[Gino Severini]], 1911, ''La danseuse obsedante (The Haunting Dancer, Ruhelose Tanzerin)'', oil on canvas, 73.5 x 54 cm, private collection]]
An interpretation of this statement was made by Robert L. Herbert: "What Metzinger meant is that each little tile of pigment has two lives: it exists as a plane where mere size and direction are fundamental to the rhythm of the painting and, secondly, it also has color which can vary independently of size and placement." (Herbert, 1968)&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jean Metzinger"&gt;Jean Metzinger, ca. 1907, quoted in Georges Desvallières, ''La Grande Revue'', vol. 124, 1907, as cited in Robert L. Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

During Metzinger's [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] period (see ''[[Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape]]'', 1905–06), each individual square of pigment associated with another of similar shape and color to form a group; each grouping of color juxtaposed with an adjacent collection of differing colors; just as syllables combine to form sentences, and sentences combine to form paragraphs, and so on. Now, the same concept formerly related to color has been adapted to form. Each individual facet associated with another adjacent shape form a group; each grouping juxtaposed with an adjacent collection of facets connect or become associated with a larger organization—just as the association of syllables combine to form sentences, and sentences combine to form paragraphs, and so on—forming what Metzinger described as the 'total image'.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985"&gt;Daniel Robbins, 1985, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', University of Iowa Museum of Art, Iowa City, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 9-23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Impressionism===
[[File:Robert Delaunay, c.1906, Paysage au disque solaire, oil on canvas, 54 x 46 cm, Musée National d'Art Moderne.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Delaunay]], 1906-07, ''Paysage au disque'', oil on canvas, 55 x 46 cm, Musée national d'art moderne (MNAM), [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris]]
"Artists of the years 1910-1914, including Mondrian and Kandinsky as well as the Cubists", writes Robert Herbert, "took support from one of its central principles: that line and color have the ability to communicate certain emotions to the observer, independently of natural form." He continues, "Neo-Impressionist color theory had an important heir in the person of Robert Delaunay. He had been a Neo-Impressionist in the Fauve period, and knew intimately the writings of Signac and Henry. His famous solar discs of 1912 and 1913 are descended from the Neo-Impressionists' concentration upon the decomposition of spectral light."&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

The height of Metzinger's Neo-Impressionist work was in 1906 and 1907, when he and Delaunay painted portraits of one another in prominent rectangles of pigment. In the sky of Metzinger's ''[[Coucher de soleil no. 1]]'', 1906–1907 (Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller), is the solar disk which Delaunay was later (during his Cubist and Orphist phases) to make into a personal emblem.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

The vibrating image of the sun in Metzinger's painting, and so too of Delaunay's ''Paysage au disque'', "is an homage to the decomposition of spectral light that lay at the heart of Neo-Impressionist color theory..." (Herbert, 1968) (See, Jean Metzinger, Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo).&lt;ref&gt;[http://kmm.nl/object/KM%20103.080%20RECTO/Landschap Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo, Jean Metzinger, ''Coucher de soleil No. 1''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524204851/http://kmm.nl/object/KM%20103.080%20RECTO/Landschap |date=2013-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metzinger, followed closely by Delaunay—the two often painting together in 1906 and 1907—would develop a new style of Neo-Impressionism incorporating large cubic brushstrokes within highly geometrized compositions that had great significance shortly thereafter within the context of their Cubist works. Both [[Gino Severini]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] developed a similar mosaic-like Cubo-Divisionist technique between 1909 and 1911. The [[Futurists]] later (1911–1916) would incorporate the style, under the influence of [[Gino Severini]]'s Parisian works, into their 'dynamic' paintings and sculpture.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;
 
"The Neo-Impressionists" according to Maurice Denis, "inaugurated a vision, a technique, and esthetic based on the recent discoveries of physics, on a scientific conception of the world and of life."&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

Robert Herbert writes, of the changes occurring in the early 20th century: "By about 1904, the resolution of the dilemma was made in favor of the abstract side of the equation. "Harmony means sacrifice", Cross said, and much of early Neo-Impressionism was jettisoned. Although they paid lip service to their established theory, Signac and Cross now painted in enormous strokes which could never pretend to mix in the eye, and which did not even retain nuance of tone. Raw, bold yellows, magentas, reds, blues, and greens sprang forth from their canvases, making them as free of the trammels of nature as any painting then being done in Europe."&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

Where the dialectic nature of Cézanne's work had been greatly influential during the highly expressionistic phase of proto-Cubism, between 1908 and 1910, the work of Seurat, with its flatter, more linear structures, would capture the attention of the Cubists from 1911.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

[[File:Georges Seurat, 1889-90, Le Chahut, Kröller-Müller Museum.jpg|thumb|left|[[Georges Seurat]], 1889-90, ''[[Le Chahut]]'', oil on canvas, 171.5 x 140.5 cm (66 7/8 x 54 3/4 in), [[Kröller-Müller Museum]], [[Otterlo]], [[Netherlands]]]]
"With the advent of monochromatic Cubism in 1910-1911," Herbert continues, "questions of form displaced color in the artists' attention, and for these Seurat was more relevant. Thanks to several exhibitions, his paintings and drawings were easily seen in Paris, and reproductions of his major compositions circulated widely among the Cubists. The Chahut [Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo] was called by André Salmon "one of the great icons of the new devotion", and both it and the ''[[The Circus (Seurat painting)|Cirque (Circus)]]'', Musée d'Orsay, Paris, according to [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], "almost belong to Synthetic Cubism".&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

The concept was well established among the French artists that painting could be expressed mathematically, in terms of both color and form; and this mathematical expression resulted in an independent and compelling 'objective truth,' perhaps more so than the objective truth of the object represented.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

Indeed, the Neo-Impressionists had succeeded in establishing an objective scientific basis in the domain of color (Seurat addresses both problems in ''Circus'' and ''Dancers''). Soon, the Cubists were to do so in both the domain of form and dynamics ([[Orphism (art)|Orphism]]) would do so with color too.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

With the exception of Picasso (his Blue and Pink periods being entirely different intellectually), all the leading Cubists and Futurists came from Neo-Impressionism, believing its objective validity to be a scientific discovery. It was in part this scientific basis that left the avant-garde artists vulnerable to the critique of scientific objectivity, of the type developed first by [[Immanuel Kant]], then [[Ernst Mach]], [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Hermann Minkowski]] and of course [[Albert Einstein]]; in relation to, for example, the treatment of time as the fourth dimension.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/othertxts/miller Peter Brooke, ''Letter to Arthur Miller'', A commentary on Arthur Miller's ''Einstein - Picasso: Space, Time and the beauty that causes havoc'', Basic Books, New York, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

===African, Egyptian, Greek, Iberian &amp; Oceanic art===

Another factor in the shift towards abstraction could be found burgeoning in art circles during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Europeans were discovering [[Prehistoric art]], along with art produced by a variety of cultures: [[African art]], [[Cycladic art]], [[Oceanic art]], [[Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas|Art of the Americas]], the [[Art of ancient Egypt]], [[Iberian sculpture]], and [[Iberian schematic art]]. Artists such as [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[André Derain]], [[Henri Rousseau]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] were intrigued and inspired by the stark power and stylistic simplicity of those cultures.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;Douglas Cooper, [https://archive.org/stream/cubistepoch00coop#page/n0/mode/2up ''The Cubist Epoch''], London: Phaidon in association with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art &amp; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1970. {{ISBN|0-87587-041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1906, Picasso met Matisse through [[Gertrude Stein]], at a time when both artists had recently acquired an interest in [[Tribal art]], [[Iberian sculpture]] and [[African tribal masks]]. They became friendly rivals and competed with each other throughout their careers, perhaps leading to Picasso entering a new period in his work by 1907, marked by the influence of ethnographic art. Picasso's paintings of 1907 have been characterized as proto-Cubism, as ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', the [[Antecedent (genealogy)|antecedent]] of Cubism.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

The African influence, which introduced anatomical simplifications and expressive features, is another generally assumed starting point for the Proto-Cubism of Picasso. He began working on studies for [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]] after a visit to the ethnographic museum at Palais du Trocadero. [[Pierre Daix]], explored Picasso’s Cubism from a formal position in relation to the ideas and works of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] on the subject of myth. Without doubt, writes Podoksik, Picasso’s proto-Cubism—coming as it did not from the external appearance of events and things, but from great emotional and instinctive feelings, from the most profound layers of the psyche—clairvoyantly (as Rimbaud would have said) arrived at the suprapersonal and thereby borders on the archaic mythological consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W09TW-75Be0C&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=%22proto-cubism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0lE4CdAuFA&amp;sig=BS3eQQafhGRg3p46AVQc3YjAMfs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r48qUevONcLRhAfZyYH4Dw&amp;ved=0CHUQ6AEwHQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22proto-cubism%22&amp;f=false Victoria Charles, ''Pablo Picasso'', Parkstone International, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zsHayTqUCTsC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=Pierre+Daix,+rimbaud,+picasso,+conscience+mythologie+archaïques&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2gmkbih4Ru&amp;sig=MgG93AripQUGLBdWvvcYc69dIiI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ldAsUbGDFIeS0QWHq4HYBQ&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pierre%20Daix%2C%20rimbaud%2C%20picasso%2C%20conscience%20mythologie%20archaïques&amp;f=false Anatoli Podoksik, Victoria Charles, ''Pablo Picasso'', Parkstone International, 2011], {{ISBN|978-1-78042-285-5}} (French)&lt;/ref&gt;

European artists (and art collectors) prized these objects for their stylistic traits defined as attributes of primitive expression: absence of classical perspective, simple outlines and shapes, presence of symbolic signs including the [[hieroglyph]], emotive figural distortions, and the dynamic rhythms generated by repetitive ornamental patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon-Godeau, Abigail, ''Going Native: Paul Gauguin and the Invention of Primitivist Modernism'', in ''The Expanded Discourse: Feminism and Art History'', N. Broude and M. Garrard (Eds.). New York: Harper Collins, 1986, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; These were the profound energizing stylistic attributes, present in the visual arts of Africa, Oceana, the Americas, that attracted the Parisian avant-garde.

[[File:Paul Gauguin, 1894, Oviri (Sauvage), partially glazed stoneware, 75 x 19 x 27 cm, Musée d'Orsay, Paris.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Gauguin]], 1894, ''[[Oviri (Gauguin)|Oviri (Sauvage)]]'', partially glazed stoneware, 75 x 19 x 27 cm, Musée d'Orsay, Paris]]
The works of [[Paul Gauguin]] had achieved center stage in the avant-garde circles of Paris following the powerful posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the [[Salon d'Automne]] in 1903 and 1906. Picasso's paintings of monumental figures from 1906 were directly influenced by the paintings, sculptures and writings of Gauguin. The savage power evoked by Gauguin's work lead directly to ''Les Demoiselles'' in 1907. According to Gauguin biographer David Sweetman, Picasso became an aficionado of Gauguin's work in 1902 when he befriended the expatriate Spanish sculptor and ceramist Paco Durrio in Paris. Durrio, both a friend of Gauguin's and an unpaid agent of his work, had several of Gauguin's works on hand, in an attempt to help his poverty-stricken friend in Tahiti by promoting his [[Work of art|oeuvre]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Sweetman"&gt;David Sweetman, ''Paul Gauguin, A life'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995. {{ISBN|0-684-80941-9}}, 562-563&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning Gauguin's impact on Picasso, art historian [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] wrote,
:"The 1906 exhibition of Gauguin's work left Picasso more than ever in this artist's thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art—not to speak of elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, classical myths, and much else besides—could be combined into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound conventional notions of beauty, he demonstrated, by harnessing his demons to the dark gods (not necessarily Tahitian ones) and tapping a new source of divine energy. If in later years Picasso played down his debt to Gauguin, there is no doubt that between 1905 and 1907 he felt a very close kinship with this other Paul, who prided himself on Spanish genes inherited from his Peruvian grandmother. Had not Picasso signed himself 'Paul' in Gauguin's honor."&lt;ref&gt;John A. Richardson, ''A Life Of Picasso, The Cubist Rebel 1907–1916'', New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-307-26665-1}}, 1991, 461&lt;/ref&gt;

Both David Sweetman and John Richardson point to the Gauguin's ''[[Oviri (Gauguin)|Oviri]]'' (literally meaning 'savage'), a gruesome phallic representation of the Tahitian goddess of life and death intended for Gauguin's grave. First exhibited in the 1906 Salon d'Automne retrospective, it was likely a direct influence on ''Les Demoiselles.'' Sweetman writes, "Gauguin's statue ''Oviri,'' which was prominently displayed in 1906, was to stimulate Picasso's interest in both sculpture and ceramics, while the woodcuts would reinforce his interest in print-making, though it was the element of the primitive in all of them which most conditioned the direction that Picasso's art would take. This interest would culminate in the seminal ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon''."&lt;ref name="Sweetman" /&gt;

Many artists associated with [[Post-Impressionism]], [[Divisionism]] and [[Fauvism]] transited through a proto-Cubist period, while some delved deeper into the problems of geometric abstraction, becoming known as Cubists, others chose different paths. And not all underwent the transformation by passing through the [[Primitivism|Primitivist]] phase.

Grasset stresses the principle that various simple geometric shapes (e.g., the circle, triangle, the square, along with their respective volumes, spheres, cones and cubes) are the basis of all compositional arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/mthodedecomposit01gras |title=Eugène Grasset, '&amp;#39;Méthode de composition ornementale'&amp;#39;, 1905, Full Text (in French) |publisher=Archive.org |date=2001-03-10 |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chronophotography====
[[File:Kiss, animated from Animal locomotion, Vol. IV, Plate 444 by Eadweard Muybridge.gif|thumb|left|[[Eadweard Muybridge]], 1887, ''Kiss'', animated from Animal locomotion, Vol. IV, Plate 444]]
The [[Chronophotography]] of [[Eadweard Muybridge]] and [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] had a profound influence on the beginnings of Cubism and Futurism. These photographic motion studies particularly interested artists that would later form a groups known as the [[Société Normande de Peinture Moderne]] and [[Section d'Or]], including Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes and Marcel Duchamp. A predecessor to cinematography and moving film, chronophotography involved a series or succession of different images, originally created and used for the scientific study of movement. These studies would directly influence [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2|Nu descendant un escalier n° 2]]''&lt;ref&gt;Tomkins, Calvin (1996). Duchamp: A Biography. U.S.: Henry Holt and Company, Inc. {{ISBN|0-8050-5789-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and could also be read into Metzinger's work of 1910-12, though rather than simultaneously superimposing successive images to depict the motion, Metzinger represents the subject at rest viewed from multiple angles; the dynamic role is played by the artist rather than the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/marey/?do=fic&amp;idn=P345 Étienne-Jules Marey, ''La Science du mouvement et l'image du temps''], (The Science of mouvement and the image of time)&lt;/ref&gt;

Eadweard Muybridge's sequential photography of movements broken down frame by frame produced in the late 19th century depicting a wide variety of subjects in motion, were known in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. Muybridge often traveled to Europe to promote his work and he met Étienne-Jules Marey in 1881. His freeze-framed images evoked time and motion. Displayed in a grid, the subject is captured in split-second intervals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Helios.html?id=bwBMAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Philip Brookman, ''Helios: Eadweard Muybridge in a Time of Change'', Corcoran Gallery of Art] in Washington, DC, 2010 {{ISBN|978-3-86521-926-8}} (Steidl).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2010/04/13/125899013/muybridge-the-man-who-made-pictures-move [[Neda Ulaby]], ''Muybridge: The Man Who Made Pictures Move'', 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Eadweard_Muybridge.html?id=VIUaQwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Philip Brookman, with contributions by Marta Braun, Andy Grundberg, Corey Keller and Rebecca Solnit, ''Eadweard Muybridge'', San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Tate Pub., 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Katherine Kuh, Marcel Duchamp spoke about his work and its relation to the photographic motion studies of Muybridge and Marey:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The idea of describing the movement of a nude coming downstairs while still retaining static visual means to do this, particularly interested me. The fact that I had seen chronophotographs of fencers in action and horse galloping (what we today call stroboscopic photography) gave me the idea for the ''Nude''. It doesn't mean that I copied these photographs. The Futurists were also interested in somewhat the same idea, though I was never a Futurist. And of course the motion picture with its cinematic techniques was developing then too. The whole idea of movement, of speed, was in the air."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warholstars.org/abstractexpressionism/artists/duchamp/marcelduchamp.html Katherine Kuh, ''Marcel Duchamp'', interview broadcast on the BBC program 'Monitor', 29 March 1961, published in Katherine Kuh (ed.), ''The Artist's Voice.

[[File:Thomas Eakins Man Pole-Vaulting.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Eakins]], ca.1885, ''Man Pole-vaulting'', Study in human motion. Eakins invented a camera that could record several sequential exposures of a moving person in a single photograph]]
Between 1883 and 1886, Muybridge made more than 100,000 images, capturing the interest of artists at home and abroad. In 1884, the painter [[Thomas Eakins]] briefly worked alongside him, learning about the application of photography to the study of human and animal motion. Eakins later favoured the use of [[multiple exposure]]s superimposed on a single photographic negative, while Muybridge used multiple cameras to produce separate images that could be projected by his zoopraxiscope.&lt;ref name=Brookman&gt;{{cite book|last=Brookman|first=Philip|title=Helios : Eadweard Muybridge in a time of change|year=2010|publisher=Steidl|location=[Göttingen, Germany]|isbn=9783865219268|page=93|author2=Marta Braun |author3=Andy Grundberg |author4=Corey Keller |author5=Rebecca Solnit }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887, Muybridge's photos were published as a massive portfolio comprising 781 plates and 20,000 photographs in a groundbreaking collection titled ''Animal Locomotion: an Electro-Photographic Investigation of Connective Phases of Animal Movements''.&lt;ref name=UPennArchive&gt;[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html Selected Items from the Eadweard Muybridge Collection (University of Pennsylvania Archives and Records Center)] "The Eadweard Muybridge Collection at the University of Pennsylvania Archives contains 702 of the 784 plates in his Animal Locomotion study"&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later work, Muybridge was influenced by, and in turn influenced the French photographer [[Étienne-Jules Marey]]. In 1881, Muybridge first visited Marey's studio in France and viewed stop-motion studies before returning to the US to further his own work in the same area.&lt;ref name=Brookman91&gt;{{cite book|last=Brookman|first=Philip|title=Helios : Eadweard Muybridge in a time of change|year=2010|publisher=Steidl|location=[Göttingen, Germany]|isbn=9783865219268|page=91|author2=Marta Braun |author3=Andy Grundberg |author4=Corey Keller |author5=Rebecca Solnit }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marey was a pioneer in producing multiple exposure sequential images using a rotary shutter in his so-called "Marey wheel" camera.

[[File:Marey- Man walking, 1890–91.jpg|thumb|left|[[Étienne-Jules Marey]], 1890–91, ''Homme qui marche (Man Walking)'', [[Chronophotography]]]]
While Marey's scientific achievements in [[photography]] and [[chronophotography]] are indisputable, Muybridge's efforts were to some degree more artistic than scientific.&lt;ref name=Adam14&gt;{{cite book|last=Adam, (ed.)|first=Hans Christian|title=Eadweard Muybridge, the human and animal locomotion photographs|year=2010|publisher=Taschen|location=Köln|isbn=9783836509411|page=14|edition=1. Aufl.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his work at the University of Pennsylvania, Muybridge travelled extensively, giving numerous lectures and demonstrations of his still photography and primitive motion picture sequences. At the Chicago [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893, Muybridge presented a series of lectures on the "Science of Animal Locomotion" in the Zoopraxographical Hall, built specially for that purpose. He used his zoopraxiscope to show his [[film|moving pictures]] to a paying public, making the Hall the first commercial [[movie theater]].&lt;ref name="BC"&gt;{{cite book| last = Clegg| first = Brian| title = The Man Who Stopped Time| publisher = [[Joseph Henry Press]]| year = 2007| isbn = 0-309-10112-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marey also made movies. His chronophotographic gun (1882) was capable of taking 12 consecutive frames a second, and the most interesting fact is that all the frames were recorded on the same picture. Using these pictures he studied a great variety of animals. Some call it Marey’s "animated zoo". Marey also studied human [[animal locomotion|locomotion]]. He published several books including ''Le Mouvement'' in 1894.

His movies were at a high speed of 60 images per second and of excellent image quality: coming close to perfection in slow-motion cinematography. His research on how to capture and display moving images helped the emerging field of [[cinematography]].

Towards the turn of the century he returned to studying the movement of quite abstract forms, like a falling ball. His last great work, executed just before the outbreak of Fauvism in Paris, was the observation and photography of smoke trails. This research was partially funded by [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]] under the auspices of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], after the two met in [[Paris]] at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)]].

====Philosophical, scientific and social motivations====
To justify such a radical move towards the depiction of the world in unrecognizable terms, Antliff and Leighten argue that the emergence of Cubism transpired during an era of dissatisfaction with [[positivism]], [[materialism]] and [[determinism]].&lt;ref name=" Antliff, Leighten"&gt;[http://eres.lndproxy.org/edoc/AH317Antliff-09.pdf Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, ''Cubism and Culture'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th century theories upon which such philosophies were based, came under attack by intellectuals such as the philosophers [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[William James]] and the mathematician [[Henri Poincaré]]. New philosophical and scientific ideas emerged based on [[non-Euclidean geometry]], [[Riemannian geometry]] and the [[Relativism|relativity of knowledge]], contradicting notions of [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute truth]]. These ideas were disseminated and debated in widely available popularized publications, and read by writers and artists associated with the advent of Cubism. Popularized too were new scientific discoveries such as [[Wilhelm Röntgen|Röntgen]]'s [[X-ray]]s, [[Heinrich Hertz|Hertzian]] [[electromagnetic radiation]] and [[radio waves]] propagating through space, revealing realities not only hidden from human observation, but beyond the sphere of [[sensory perception]]. Perception was no longer associated solely with the static, passive receipt of visible signals, but became dynamically shaped by [[Perceptual learning|learning]], [[memory]] and [[expectation (epistemic)|expectation]].&lt;ref name=" Antliff, Leighten" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gregory, "Perception" in Gregory, Zangwill (1987) pp. 598–601&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Henderson"&gt;Linda D. Henderson, ''The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean geometry in Modern Art'', Princeton University Press, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1881 and 1882 Poincaré wrote a series of works titled ''On curves defined by differential equations'' within which he built a new branch of mathematics called "qualitative theory of differential equations". Poincaré showed that even if the differential equation can not be solved in terms of known functions, a wealth of information about the properties and behavior of the solutions can be found (from the very form of the equation). He investigated the nature of trajectories of integral curves in a plane; classifying singular points (saddle, focus, center, node), introducing the concept of a limit cycle and the loop index. For the finite-difference equations, he created a new direction – the asymptotic analysis of the solutions. He applied all these achievements to study practical problems of [[mathematical physics]] and [[celestial mechanics]], and the methods used were the basis of its topological works.&lt;ref&gt;Kolmogorov, AP Yushkevich, Mathematics of the 19th century Vol = 3. page = 283 {{ISBN|978-3764358457}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kolmogorov, AP Yushkevich, Mathematics of the 19th century. pages = 162–174&lt;/ref&gt;

Poincaré, following [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], [[Nikolai Lobachevsky|Lobachevsky]], [[Bernhard Riemann]] and others, viewed geometric models as mere conventions rather than as absolute. [[Euclidean geometry]], upon which traditional [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] had been founded, was but one geometric configuration among others. [[Non-Euclidean geometry]], with its hyperbolic or spherically curved space, was thus, at the very least, an equally valid alternative. This discovery in the world of mathematics overthrew 2000 years of seeming absolutes in Euclidean geometry, and threw into question conventional Renaissance perspective by suggesting the possible existence of multi-dimensional worlds and perspectives in which things might look very different.&lt;ref name="Henderson" /&gt;

Pictorial space could now be transformed in response to the artists own subjectivity (expressing primal impulses, irrespective of classical perspective and Beaux Arts artistic expectations). "Adherence to subjectivity in turn" write Antliff and Leighten, "signalled a radical break from past pictorial conventions in favour of a Nietzschean expression of individual will".&lt;ref name=" Antliff, Leighten" /&gt;

Poincaré postulated that the laws believed to govern matter were created solely by the minds that 'understood' them and that no theory could be considered 'true'. "The things themselves are not what science can reach..., but only the relations between things. Outside of these relations there is no knowable reality", Poincaré wrote in his 1902 ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]''.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

[[File:Jouffret.gif|right|thumb|An illustration from Jouffret's ''Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions''. The book, which influenced Picasso, was given to him by Princet.]]
Princet is credited with introducing the work of [[Henri Poincaré]] and the concept of the "[[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]]" to artists at the [[Le Bateau-Lavoir|Bateau-Lavoir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |title=Einstein, Picasso |pages=101 |isbn=0-465-01859-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Princet brought to the attention of Picasso, Metzinger and others, a book by [[Esprit Jouffret]], ''Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions'' (''Elementary Treatise on the Geometry of Four Dimensions'', 1903),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jouffret |first=Esprit |title=Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions et introduction à la géométrie à n dimensions |url=http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.math/docviewer?did=04810001 |accessdate=2008-02-06 |year=1903 |publisher=Gauthier-Villars |location=Paris |language=French |oclc=1445172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/traitlmentaired00joufgoog/page/n9 Jouffret, Esprit, ''Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions et introduction à la géométrie à n dimensions''], 1903, (in French) archive.org&lt;/ref&gt; a popularization of Poincaré's ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]'' in which Jouffret described [[hypercube]]s and other complex [[Polyhedron|polyhedra]] in four [[dimension]]s and projected them onto the two-dimensional surface.

In 1907, Princet's wife left him for [[André Derain]], and he drifted away from the circle of artists at the Bateau-Lavoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robbin |first=Tony |authorlink=Tony Robbin |title=Shadows of Reality, The Fourth Dimension in Relativity, Cubism, and Modern Thought |year=2006 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-11039-1 |pages=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But Princet remained close to Metzinger and would soon participate in meetings of the [[Section d'Or]] in [[Puteaux]]. He gave informal lectures to the group, many of whom were passionate about mathematical order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Everdell |first=William R. |authorlink=William Everdell |title=The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought |year=1997 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-22480-5 |pages=312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princet's influence on the Cubists was attested to by [[Maurice de Vlaminck]]: "I witnessed the birth of cubism, its growth, its decline. Picasso was the obstetrician, Guillaume Apollinaire the midwife, Princet the godfather."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vlaminck |first=Maurice |authorlink=Maurice de Vlaminck |date=June 6, 1942 |title=Opinions libres... sur la peinture |journal=Comédia |pages=1, 6 |quote=J'ai assisté à la naissance du cubisme, à sa croissance, à son déclin.

[[Louis Vauxcelles]] along similar lines dubbed Princet, sarcastically, the 'father of Cubism': "M. Princet has studied at length non-Euclidean geometry and the theorems of Riemann, of which Gleizes and Metzinger speak rather carelessly. Now then, M. Princet one day met M. Max Jacob and confided him one or two of his discoveries relating to the fourth dimension. M. Jacob informed the ingenious M. Picasso of it, and M. Picasso saw there a possibility of new ornamental schemes. M. Picasso explained his intentions to M. Apollinaire, who hastened to write them up in formularies and codify them. The thing spread and propagated. Cubism, the child of M. Princet, was born".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vauxcelles |first=Louis |authorlink=Louis Vauxcelles |date=December 29, 1918 |title=Le Carnet des ateliers: La Père du cubisme |journal=Le Carnet de la semaine |pages=11 }} in {{cite book |last=Henderson |first=Linda Dalrymple |title=The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art |year=1983 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=0-691-10142-6 |page=72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metzinger, in 1910, wrote of Princet: "[Picasso] lays out a free, mobile perspective, from which that ingenious mathematician Maurice Princet has deduced a whole geometry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |date=October–November 1910 |title=Note sur la peinture |journal=Pan |pages=60 }} in {{cite book |last=Miller |title=Einstein, Picasso |pages=167 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Metzinger wrote in his memoirs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Maurice Princet joined us often. Although quite young, thanks to his knowledge of mathematics he had an important job in an insurance company. But, beyond his profession, it was as an artist that he conceptualized mathematics, as an aesthetician that he invoked ''n''-dimensional continuums. He loved to get the artists interested in the new views on space that had been opened up by Schlegel and some others. He succeeded at that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |title=Le cubisme était né |year=1972 |publisher=Éditions Présence |location=Paris |isbn= |pages=43–44 }} in {{cite book |last=Ferry |first=Luc |authorlink=Luc Ferry |others=Robert De Loaiza, trans. |title=Homo Aestheticus: The Invention of Taste in the Democratic Age |year=1993 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-24459-8 |pages=215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Bergson, James, Stein====
The nineteenth-century positivists concept of measurable deterministic time became untenable as [[Henri Bergson]] exposed his radical idea that the human experience of time was a creative process associated with biological evolution. He rejected the division of space into separate measurable units. Both Bergson and [[William James]] described the intellect as an instrumental tool, a by-product of evolution. The intellect was no longer considered a cognitive faculty able to grasp reality in an impartial manner. Instead, argued Bergson, we should rely on intuition to inspired creative insights in both the sciences and the arts. His third major work, ''Creative Evolution'', the most widely known and most discussed of his books, appeared in 1907, constituting one of the most profound and original contributions to the philosophical consideration of evolution. The proto-Cubists would have known of his work through, amongst others, [[Gertrude Stein]] a student of William James. Stein had recently purchased, following the 1905 [[Salon d'Automne]], Matisse's ''[[Woman with a Hat]] (La femme au chapeau)''&lt;ref&gt;Matisse's ''Woman with a Hat'' is now at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art&lt;/ref&gt; and Picasso's ''Young Girl with Basket of Flowers''.&lt;ref&gt;Color plates of ''Young Girl with Basket of Flowers'', or ''Jeune fille aux fleurs'', appear in Hobhouse, 1975, at 68 and Burns, 1970, at 8. The painting now in a private collection was displayed in a 2003 Matisse/Picasso exhibit.&lt;/ref&gt; With James's supervision, Stein and fellow student, Leon Mendez Solomons, performed experiments on ''normal motor automatism'', a phenomenon hypothesized to occur in people when their attention is divided between two simultaneous intelligent activities such as writing and speaking, yielding examples of writing that appeared to represent "[[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Has Gertrude Stein a Secret?"

Disposed to accept the unorthodox in life and art, and naturally tolerant of eccentricity, Gertrude Stein had accommodated the tendency of her Parisian contemporaries of spend their time and talent looking for ways to [[Épater la bourgeoisie]]. According to the American poet and literary critic [[John Malcolm Brinnin]], this was "a society committed to the systematic outraging of every rule".&lt;ref name="Brinnin"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/thirdrose030726mbp John Malcolm Brinnin, ''The Third Rose, Gertrude Stein and Her World'', An Atlantic Monthly Press Book, Little, Brown and Company, Boston, Toronto, 1959]&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso's famous dinner party for [[Henri Rousseau|Le Douanier Rousseau]] was an eye-opening event in the proto-Cubist period. ''Le Banquet Rousseau'', "one of the most notable social events of the twentieth century", writes Brinnin, "was neither an orgiastic occasion nor even an opulent one. Its subsequent fame grew from the fact that it was a colorful happening within a revolutionary art movement at a point of that movement's earliest success, and from the fact that it was attended by individuals whose separate influences radiated like spokes of creative light across the art world for generations."&lt;ref name="Brinnin" /&gt;

[[:fr:Maurice Raynal|Maurice Raynal]], in ''Les Soires de Paris'', 15 January 1914, p.&amp;nbsp;69, wrote about "Le Banquet Rousseau".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LQUeVH8Sh4oC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=André+Salmon,+%22banquet+Rousseau%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ievCA-jlLA&amp;sig=WaLalYMO1ksgzL1xbpL6yvyTghw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W6wvUc6VFMjV0QXysICwDA&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=banquet%20Rousseau&amp;f=false Ann Temkin, ''Rousseau: The Dream'', The Museum of Modern Art, July 31, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Years later the French writer [[André Salmon]] recalled the setting of the illustrious banquet; Picasso's studio at [[Le Bateau-Lavoir]]:

:"Here the nights of the Blue Period passed... here the days of the Rose Period flowered... here the Demoiselles d'Avignon halted in their dance to re-group themselves in accordance with the golden number and the secret of the fourth dimension... here fraternized the poets elevated by serious criticism into the School of the Rue Ravignan... here in these shadowy corridors lived the true worshippers of fire ... here one evening in the year 1908 unrolled the pageantry of the first and last banquet offered by his admirers to the painter Henri Rousseau called the Douanier."&lt;ref name="Monet to Moore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brinnin" /&gt;

Guests at the ''banquet Rousseau'' of 1908, in addition to Picasso and the guest of honor, included [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Marie Laurencin]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[André Salmon]], [[:fr:Maurice Raynal|Maurice Raynal]], [[Daniel-Henri Kahnweiler]], [[Leo Stein]] and [[Gertrude Stein]].&lt;ref name="Monet to Moore" /&gt;

No observer, either academic or independent, could have mistaken the direction of change taken by the avant-garde between 1906 and 1910. The fundamental shift away from nature within artistic circles had advanced to the status of ''revolt'', in far-reaching ways, diverging significantly from the developments of Cézanne or Seurat. The symptoms of that shift during the first decade of the 20th century are countless and redoubtable, bursting practically overnight, and were soon to be perceived by the reactionary adversaries as no more than grotesque, incomprehensible, to be considered with haughty amusement.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

==The Wild Men of Paris==
Leading up to 1910, one year before the scandalous group exhibiting that brought "Cubism" to the attention of the general public for the first time, the draftsman, illustrator and poet, [[Gelett Burgess]], interviewed and wrote about artists and artworks in and around Paris. After his visit to the 1910 [[Salon des Indépendants]], the well-established anti-establishment art exhibition at this time peppered with proto-Cubist works, he wrote in humorist fashion:

&lt;Blockquote&gt;There were no limits to the audacity and the ugliness of the canvasses. Still-life sketches of round, round apples and yellow, yellow oranges, on square, square tables, seen in impossible perspective; landscapes of squirming trees, with blobs of virgin color gone wrong, fierce greens and coruscating yellows, violent purples, sickening reds and shuddering blues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

But the nudes! They looked like flayed Martians, like pathological charts—hideous old women, patched with gruesome hues, lopsided, with arms like the arms of a Swastika, sprawling on vivid backgrounds, or frozen stiffly upright, glaring through misshapen eyes, with noses or fingers missing. They defied anatomy, physiology, almost geometry itself!&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess"&gt;[http://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/11445-the-wild-men-of-paris Gelett Burgess, Wild Men of Paris, The Architectural Record, May 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Matisse's ''[[Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)]]'' appeared at the 1907 Indépendants, entitled ''Tableau no. III''. Vauxcelles writes on the topic of ''Nu bleu'':

In addition to the works of Matisse, Derain and Braque, the Indépendants of 1907 included six works (each) by Vlaminck, Dufy, Metzinger, Delaunay, Camoin, Herbin, Puy, Valtat, and three by Marquet.

Vaucelles described this group of 'Fauves':

&lt;blockquote&gt;A movement I consider dangerous (despite the great sympathy I have for its perpetrators) is taking shape among a small clan of youngsters. A chapel has been established, two haughty priests officiating. MM Derain and Matisse; a few dozen innocent catechumens have received their baptism. Their dogma amounts to a wavering schematicism that proscribes modeling and volumes in the name of I-don't-know-what pictorial abstraction. This new religion hardly appeals to me. I don't believe in this Renaissance... M. Matisse, fauve-in-chief; M. Derain, fauve deputy; MM. Othon Friesz and Dufy, fauves in attendance... and M. Delaunay (a fourteen-year-old-pupil of M. Metzinger...), infantile fauvelet.

The dance theme passed through several stages in Matisse's work prior to this canvas. Only here, however, did it acquire its famous passion and expressive resonance. The frenzy of the pagan bacchanalia is embodied in the powerful, stunning accord of red, blue and green, uniting Man, Heaven and Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/fcgi-bin/db2www/descrPage.mac/descrPage?selLang=English&amp;indexClass=PICTURE_EN&amp;Query_Exp=%28WOA_TYPE+%3D%3D+%22Painting%22%29+AND+%28WOA_AUTHOR+%3D%3D+%22Matisse%2C+Henri%22%29&amp;PID=GJ-9673&amp;numView=1&amp;ID_NUM=8&amp;thumbFile=%2Ftmplobs%2FD2IQ47M%24BWXA34AL6.jpg&amp;embViewVer=noEmb&amp;comeFrom=browse&amp;check=false&amp;sorting=WOA_AUTHOR%5EWOA_NAME&amp;thumbId=6&amp;numResults=38&amp;author=Matisse%2C%26%2332%3BHenri Henri Matisse, 1909-10, ''The Dance'', Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Fauvism of Matisse and Derain was virtually over by the spring of the 1907 Indépendants. And by the Salon d'Automne of 1907 it had ended for many others as well. The shift from bright pure colors loosely applied to the canvas gave way to a more calculated geometric approach. The priority of simplified form began to overtake the representational aspect of the works. The simplification of representational form gave way to a new complexity; the subject matter of the paintings progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited.

Many of Cézanne's paintings had been exhibited at the Salon d'Automne of 1904, 1905 and 1906. After Cézanne died in 1906, his paintings were exhibited in Paris in the form of a retrospective at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1907, greatly attracting interest and affecting the direction taken by the avant-garde artists in Paris prior to the advent of [[Cubism]]. Cézanne's explorations of geometric simplification and optical phenomena inspired not just Matisse, Derain, Braque and Metzinger, but the other artists who exhibited earlier with the Fauves. Those who had not transited through a Fauve stage, such as Picasso, experimented, too, with the complex fracturing of form. Cézanne had thus sparked a wholesale transformation in the area of artistic investigation that would profoundly affect the development [[modern art]] of the 20th century.

Gelett Burgess writes in ''The Wild Men of Paris'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Though the school was new to me, it was already an old story in Paris. It had been a nine-days’ wonder. Violent discussions had raged over it; it had taken its place as a revolt and held it, despite the fulmination of critics and the contempt of academicians. The school was increasing in numbers, in importance. By many it was taken seriously. At first, the beginners had been called "The Invertebrates." In the Salon of 1905 they were named "The Incoherents." But by 1906, when they grew more perfervid, more audacious, more crazed with theories, they received their present appellation of "Les Fauves"—the Wild Beasts. And so, and so, a-hunting I would go!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"It was Matisse who took the first step into the undiscovered land of the ugly. Matisse himself, serious, plaintive, a conscientious experimenter, whose works are but studies in expression, who is concerned at present with but the working out of the theory of simplicity, denies all responsibility for the excesses of his unwelcome disciples."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"Picasso, keen as a whip, spirited as a devil, mad as a hatter, runs to his studio and contrives a huge nude woman composed entirely of triangles, and presents it in triumph. What wonder Matisse shakes his head and does not smile! He chats thoughtfully of the "Harmony and volume" and "architectural values," and wild Braque climbs to his attic and builds an architectural monster which he names Woman, with balanced masses and parts, with openings and columnar legs and cornices. Matisse praises the direct appeal to instinct of the African wood images, and even a sober Dérain, a co-experimenter, loses his head, moulds a neolithic man into a solid cube, creates a woman of spheres, stretches a cat out into a cylinder, and paints it red and yellow!"&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burgess, turning his attention to Metzinger, writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Metzinger once did gorgeous mosaics of pure pigment, each little square of color not quite touching the next, so that an effect of vibrant light should result. He painted exquisite compositions of cloud and cliff and sea; he painted women and made them fair, even as the women upon the boulevards fair. But now, translated into the idiom of subjective beauty, into this strange Neo-Classic language, those same women, redrawn, appear in stiff, crude, nervous lines in patches of fierce color."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archrecord.construction.com/inthecause/0702MenOfParis/MenOfParis3.asp Gelett Burgess, ''The Wild Men of Paris'', The Architectural Record, May 1910, documents p. 3, Interview with Jean Metzinger, circa 1908-09]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Metzinger, in his ''Cubism was Born'', published years later, Cubism had been born out of the "need not for an intellectual art but for an art that would be something other than a systematic absurdity"; the idiocies of reproducing or copying nature in [[trompe l'oeil]] on a surface that is rigorously flat. With this type of illusion other artist of his generation such as Gleizes and Picasso wanted nothing to do. "Quite clearly" Metzinger notes, "nature and the painting make up two different worlds which have nothing in common..." Already, in 1906, "it could be said that a good portrait led one to think about the painter not the model".&lt;ref name="Metzinger"&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Le Cubisme était Né: Souvenirs par Jean Metzinger'' (Cubism was Born), Présence, Chambéry, 1972.

&lt;blockquote&gt;As for Picasso... the tradition he came from had prepared him better than ours for a problem to do with structure. And Berthe Weil was right when she treated those who compared him/confused him with, a Steinlen or a Lautrec as idiots. He had already rejected them in their own century, a century we had no intention of prolonging. Whether or not the Universe was endowed with another dimension, art was going to move into a different field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The illusion had been maintained up to 1906 or 1907 through the negligence of those whose job it was to clear away the rubbish, but the break was achieved in 1908. No-one would again dare to look at a Puvis de Chavannes or read Balzac. No-one, I mean, among those who walked above the Moulin Rouge, which they would never even have thought of entering.&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Metzinger, the "entirely intuitive dissociation" between color of the Fauves and form of classical painting, exemplified in the works of [[Raoul Dufy]] (who paints first, then draws), "foreshadowed, more perhaps than Cézanne or black African art, not just Cubism but all the painting that followed afterward".&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I had measured the difference that separated art prior to 1900 from the art which I felt was being born. I knew that all instruction was at an end. The age of personal expression had finally begun. The value of an artist was no longer to be judged by the finish of his execution, or by the analogies his work suggested with such-and-such an archetype. It would be judged – exclusively – by what distinguished this artist from all the others. The age of the master and pupil was finally over; I could see about me only a handful of creators and whole colonies of monkeys. (Jean Metzinger, Cubism was Born)&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From his [[Montmartre]] studio on the rue Lamarck to Picasso's Bateau Lavoir studio on the rue Ravignan, writes Metzinger, "the attempt [''prétention''] to imitate an orb on a vertical plane, or to indicate by a horizontal straight line the circular hole of a vase placed at the height of the eyes was considered as the artifice of an illusionistic trickery that belonged to another age."&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I wanted an art that was faithful to itself and would have nothing to do with the business of creating illusions. I dreamed of painting glasses from which no-one would ever think of drinking, beaches that would be quite unsuitable for bathing, nudes who would be definitively chaste. I wanted an art which in the first place would appear as a representation of the impossible. (Jean Metzinger)&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Jean Metzinger]] between 1905 and 1907 painted in a Divisionist style with large squares or rectangular planes of color (see Metzinger's ''[[Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape]]'' and ''[[La danse, Bacchante]]''). The size and direction of each plane are fundamental to the rhythm of the painting, yet color can vary independently of size and placement. This form of Divisionism was a significant step beyond the preoccupations of [[Paul Signac]] and [[Henri-Edmond Cross]]. Writing in 1906, the art critic Louis Chassevent recognized the difference and, as [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]] pointed out in his Gleizes Guggenheim catalogue, used the word "cube" which would later be taken up by [[Louis Vauxcelles]] to baptize Cubism. Chassevent writes: 
:"M. Metzinger is a mosaicist like M. Signac but he brings more precision to the cutting of his cubes of color which appear to have been made mechanically [...]".&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis Chassevent: ''Les Artistes indépendantes'', 1906&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis Chassevent, ''22e Salon des Indépendants'', 1906, ''Quelques petits salons'', Paris, 1908, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 – 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R.

The history of the word "cube" goes back at least to May 1901 when Jean Béral, reviewing Cross's Neo-Impressionist work at the Indépendants in ''Art et Littérature'' commented that he "uses a large and square pointillism, giving the impression of mosaic. One even wonders why the artist has not used cubes of solid matter diversely colored: they would make pretty revetments."&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

During the month of March, 1905, Louis Vauxcelles, in his review of the Salon des Indépendants, published on the front page of Gil Blas, writes: "M. Metzinger, still very young, mimics his elders with the candor of a child throwing handfuls of multicolored confetti; his « point », very big, gives his paintings the appearance of a mosaic".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7528616k/f1.image Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon des Indépendants'' (front page article), Gil Blas, No. 9295, A27, 23 March 1905], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906 Metzinger formed a close friendship with Robert Delaunay, with whom he would share an exhibition at [[Berthe Weill]]'s gallery early in 1907. The two of them were singled out by Louis Vauxcelles in 1907 as Divisionists who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.all-art.org/art_20th_century/metzinger1.html Art of the 20th Century]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an anonymous review of the 1908 Salon des Indépendants published in Le Matin, Metzinger is accused of making "a salad of Maurice Denis and Egyptian bas-reliefs".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5686418/f2.image Salon des Indépendants, Le Matin, Numéro 8788, 20 March 1908], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, Vauxcelles again, in his review of [[Georges Braque]]'s exhibition at Kanhweiler's gallery called Braque a daring man who despises form, "reducing everything, places and a figures and houses, to geometric schemas, to cubes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7521008s/f2.item Louis Vauxcelles, Exposition Braques, Gil Blas, 14 November 1908], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Danchev"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iTzniDD6EwAC&amp;pg=PR123&amp;lpg=PR123&amp;dq=preface,+Exposition+Georges+Braque,+November+1908,+Galerie+Kahnweiler&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DZ4-_FKVK0&amp;sig=RjxOvhE7jDIbKCa4h8QkIRsoKnQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sCcxUfLbKa6A0AXIhoGADA&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=little%20cubes&amp;f=false Alex Danchev, ''Georges Braques: A Life'', Arcade Publishing, 15 November 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vauxcelles recounts how Matisse told him at the time, "Braque has just sent in [to the 1908 Salon d'Automne] a painting made of little cubes".&lt;ref name="Danchev" /&gt; The critic Charles Morice relayed Matisse's words and spoke of Braque's little cubes. The motif of the viaduct at l'Estaque had inspired Braque to produce three paintings marked by the simplification of form and deconstruction of perspective.&lt;ref&gt;''Futurism in Paris - The Avant-garde Explosion'', Pompidou Center, Paris 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 March 1909, Vauxcelles qualifies the works of Braque exhibited at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] as "bizarreries cubiques" (cubic oddities).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7536065n Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon des Indépendants'', Gil Blas, 25 March 1909], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Vauxcelles, this time in his review of the 26th Salon des Indépendants (1910), made a passing and imprecise reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger and Le Fauconnier, as "ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes."&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7527626n/f1.item Louis Vauxcelles, ''A travers les salons: promenades aux « Indépendants »'', Gil Blas, 18 March 1910], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review of the 26th Salon des Indépendants, published 19 March 1910 in Le Petit Parisien, art critic Jean Claude pejoratively combined the terms "Metzinger-le-cubique".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k563551x/f2.image Jean Claude, La Vie Artistique, ''Au Salon des Indépendants'', Le Petit Parisien, Numéro 12194, 19 March 1910], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;

Picasso's works are exhibited at a small gallery run by the German collector-dealer [[Wilhelm Uhde]] in May 1910 (cited in Fry 58 and Robbins 1985, pp.&amp;nbsp;12, 22). The exhibition is reviewed by Léon Werth, who used the adjective 'cubic' to describe Picasso's treatment of roofs and chimneys.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

In a review of the 1910 Salon d'Automne published in L'Ouest-Éclair, a journalist (J.B.) employs the term 'Cubism' demeaningly (several months prior to the popularization of the term):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now a note on the grotesque: Among all these "fauves"—the name given to the Impressionists in conventional workshops—the most "fauve" of all is certainly Jean Metzinger, the defender of ''Cubism''. Cubism is a style of painting inspired by puzzles or these popular guessing-game designs for children found in certain newspapers, which consist of finding, for example, a hare pursued by a hunter in the landscape accessories. That's how "Cubism" proceeds. Under the title of ''Nu'' [''Nude''], Jean Metzinger shows us "cubes" of various tones, but of the same color. The trick is to find the head, the arms at different points on the canvas. It's a distraction like any other, but it is not art. This is the latest cry of pictorial craziness [''loufoquerie picturale''].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6426734/f2.image ''Le Salon d'Automne, La Bretagne et les Peinture Bretonnes'', L'Ouest-Éclair (Rennes), 5 October 1910], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another review of the 1910 Salon d'Automne, published in ''La Presse'', art critique Edmond Epardaud writes of the 'geometric follies' of Metzinger, and describes both Gleizes and Le Fauconnier as 'specious architects' (''architectes fallacieux'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k596525z/f2.image Edmond Epardaud, ''On Inaugure demain le Salon d'Automne'', La Presse, 30 September 1910, Numéro 6675, pp. 1, 2], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;

The critic Jean Claude writes in his review of the same salon, with reference to Metzinger's ''[[Nu à la cheminée]]'', published in ''Le Petit Parisien'', "Metzinger painted a puzzle, cubic and triangular, which after verification, is a naked woman. I managed to discover the head, torso and legs. I had to give up finding arms. This is beyond comprehension".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k563747g/f5.image Jean Claude, ''Grand Palais, Le Salon d'Automne'', Le Petit Parisien, 2 October 1910, Numéro 12391, p. 5], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Cézanne was "the point of departure for these mad explorers," [[Gelett Burgess]] writes, "It was Matisse who took the first step into the undiscovered land of the ugly." Picasso, at the time, painted a nude woman "composed entirely of triangles". Braque "builds an architectural monster which he names woman". Braque was, according to Burgess, "the originator of architectural nudes with square feet, as square as boxes, with right-angled shoulders". Derain, "a co-experimenter," writes Burgess, "moulds a neolithic man into a solid cube, creates a woman of spheres, stretches a cat out into a cylinder, and paints it red and yellow!"&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess" /&gt;

In his 1912 ''Anecdotal History of Cubism'' [[André Salmon]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jean Metzinger and Robert Delaunay painted landscapes planted with cottages reduced to the severe appearance of [[parallelepiped]]s. Living less of an interior life than Picasso, remaining to all outward appearances more like painters than their precursor, these young artists were in a much greater hurry for results, though they be less complete. [...]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exhibited, their works passed almost unobserved by the public and by art critics, who...recognized only the Fauves, whether it be to praise or to curse to them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, the king of the Fauves... Henri Matisse... with one word cast out Jean Metzinger and Robert Delaunay from the family. With that feminine sense of the appropriate, the basis of his taste, he baptized the cottages of the two painters, "Cubist." An ingenuous or ingenious art critic was with him. He ran to his newspaper and with style wrote the gospel article; the next day the public learned of the birth of Cubism.

The word "cube" for Chassevent in 1906, with regard to the large, thickly painted, and highly geometrized paintings of Metzinger and Delaunay, did not imply a movement. Nor did the word "cube" for Vauxcelles hold any special meaning two and a half years later when he wrote (in November 1908) a brief passage about Braque's landscapes exhibited at the Kahnweiler gallery: "He scorns forms, reduces all sites and figures and houses, to geometric schemas, to cubes":&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985" /&gt;

:"In neither case" notes Daniel Robbins, "did the use of the word "cube" lead to the immediate identification of the artists with a new pictorial attitude, with a movement. The word was no more than an isolated descriptive epithet that, in both cases, was prompted by a visible passion for structure so assertive that the critics were wrenched, momentarily, from their habitual concentration on motifs and subjects, in which context their comments on drawing, color, tonality, and, only occasionally, conception, resided." (Robbins, 1985)&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985" /&gt;

In light of the headway made by Cézanne, the multiple use of the word "cube" with reference to diverse works by diverse artists, and the other factors involved (political, social, cultural), it has been suggested that Cubism, with its proto-phase, would have emerged regardless of Picasso's intervention. The art historian and collector Douglas Cooper viewed Cubist painting to have been the beginning of a stylistic revolution which was inevitable. The American art scholar and MoMA curator [[William Rubin]] argued that Braque, with his commitment to a Cézannist syntax, would have created early Cubism had Picasso never existed.&lt;ref name="Cottington"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFGgxn7lfq0C&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=Cubism,+mobile+perspective&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rm_znb7YtG&amp;sig=8jHfIJBskeVW31AU_0hqno0HLBY&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=revolution%20that%20was%20inevitable&amp;f=false David Cottington, ''Cubism and its Histories'', Manchester University Press, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three dimensions on a flat surface==
[[File:Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1907, ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', oil on canvas, {{convert|243.9|x|233.7|cm|ft|abbr=on}} 8"), [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York. Picasso later called this his "first exorcism painting." A specific danger he had in mind was life-threatening sexual disease, a source of considerable anxiety in Paris at the time; earlier studies more closely link sexual pleasure to mortality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=79766 Pablo Picasso, ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'', MoMA, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' has often been considered a proto-Cubist work. Georges Braque's 1908 ''[[Houses at L’Estaque]]'' (and related works) prompted the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] to refer to ''bizarreries cubiques'' (cubic oddities). Gertrude Stein referred to landscapes made by Picasso in 1909, such as ''Reservoir at Horta de Ebro'' or ''Brick factory at Tortosa'', as the first Cubist paintings.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

According to the personal predilections of Kahnweiler, Picasso's [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]] was the beginning of Cubism, and yet he writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Early in 1907 Picasso began a strange large painting depicting women, fruit and drapery, which he left unfinished. It cannot be called other than unfinished, even though it represents a long period of work. Begun in the spirit of the works of 1906, it contains in one section the endeavors of 1907 and thus never constitutes a unified whole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The nudes, with large, quiet eyes, stand rigid, like mannequins. Their stiff, round bodies are flesh-colored, black and white. That is the style of 1906.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In the foreground, however, alien to the style of the rest of the painting, appear a crouching figure and a bowl of fruit. These forms are drawn angularly, not roundly modeled in chiaroscuro. The colors are luscious blue, strident yellow, next to pure black and white. This is the beginning of Cubism, the first upsurge, a desperate titanic clash with all of the problems at once. (Kahnweiler, 1920)&lt;ref name="Kahnweiler"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/riseofcubism00kahn Daniel Henry Kahnweiler, The rise of cubism (Der Weg zum Kubismus)'', New York, Wittenborn, Schultz. This is the first translation of the original German text entitled "Der Weg zum Kubismus", Munich, Delphin-Verlag, 1920]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
And Cottington following through notes that "the problems were quite unrelated, however, to the picture's subject of an encounter with five naked staring whores (even though Kahnweiler's choice of adjectives seems to have registered its affect)".&lt;ref name="Cottington" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;These problems were the basic tasks of painting: to represent three dimensions and color on a flat surface, and to comprehend them in the unity of that surface... Not the simulation of form by chiaroscuro, but the depiction of the three dimensional through drawing on a flat surface...(Kahnweiler, 1920)&lt;ref name="Kahnweiler" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kahnweiler's conclusion, similar to those leveled against Cézanne, was that Picasso's painting 'never constitutes a unified whole' and was thus unsuccessful. "After months of the most laborious searching, notes Kahnweiler, "Picasso realized that the complete solution of the problem did not lie in this direction".&lt;ref name="Cottington" /&gt; In July 1916, ''Les Demoiselles'' was exhibited to the public for the first time, and not in the gallery of Kahnweiler. It was included in the [[Salon d'Antin]], an exhibition organized by [[André Salmon]].&lt;ref&gt;Billy Klüver, ''A Day with Picasso'', The MIT Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-262-61147-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bypassing the problem of color, simply by eliminating color from his paintings, Picasso in 1908 concentrated on form. Kahnweiler notes:

:"Thus Picasso painted figures resembling Congo sculptures, and still lifes of the simplest form. His perspective in these works is similar to that of Cézanne. Light is never more than a means to create form — through chiaroscuro, since he did not at this time repeat the unsuccessful attempt of 1907 to create form through drawing."&lt;ref name="Kahnweiler" /&gt;

[[File:Landscape in Provence (Paysage de Provence) - André Derain.jpg|thumb|220px|[[André Derain]], ca.1908, ''Landscape in Provence (Paysage de Provence)'', oil on canvas, 32.2 x 40.6&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Brooklyn Museum]], New York]]
"Derain, too, had abandoned decorative light painting in 1907", Kahnweiler writes, "preceding Braque by a few months. But from the outset, their roads were diverse. Derain's endeavor to retain fidelity to nature in his painting separates him forever from Cubism, no matter how closely his ideas may otherwise parallel those of Braque."&lt;ref name="Kahnweiler" /&gt;

[[File:Othon Friesz, 1907-08, Le Travail à l'Automne, oil on canvas, 200.5 x 250 cm, National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design, Oslo.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Othon Friesz]], 1907-08, ''Le Travail à l'Automne'', oil on canvas, 200.5 x 250 cm, [[National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design]], Oslo]]
And Derain was not the only one to venture along the path of Cézanne, only to turn away from it in the coming years. Chagall, Friesz, Matisse, Dufy, Redon, Vlaminck and Modigliani are prime examples.

But too, just as Picasso and Braque, other artists independently and simultaneously explored the Cézannian approach, and did continue on to become Cubists, each with his or her own particular style.

==The sequence of events==
The Fauvism of Matisse and Derain was practically over by the spring of the 1907 [[Salon des Indépendants]]. And by the [[Salon d'Automne]] in the fall of 1907 it had ended for many others as well. The shift from expressing bright pure colors loosely applied to the canvas gave way to a more calculated geometric approach. Simplified form began to overtake the representational aspect of the works. For Metzinger and Delaunay, too, representational form gave way to a new complexity; the subject matter of the paintings progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited. And Picasso had almost completed [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]].

===1907===
* The 1907 Salon d'Automne impels Apollinaire to refer to Matisse as the "fauve of fauves". Works by both Derain and Matisse are criticized for the ugliness of their models. Braque and Le Fauconnier are considered as Fauves by the critic Michel Puy (brother of [[Jean Puy]]).&lt;ref name="Russell T. Clement" /&gt; Robert Delaunay showed one work, [[André Lhote]] showed three, [[Patrick Henry Bruce]] three, [[Jean Crotti]] one, [[Fernand Léger]] five, [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] two, [[Raoul Dufy]] three, [[André Derain]] exhibited three paintings and [[Henri Matisse]] seven works.&lt;ref name="Salon 1907"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cataloguedesouvr00salo Salon d'automne; Société du Salon d'automne], Catalogue des ouvrages de peinture, sculpture, dessin, gravure, architecture et art décoratif.

* Metzinger and Delaunay are singled out by [[Louis Vauxcelles]] as Divisionists who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985" /&gt;

===1908===

* At the Indépendants of 1908, a painting by Braque strikes Apollinaire by its originality. Though not listed in the catalog, it was described in ''L'Intransigeant''.&lt;ref name="Kubisme"&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt323.html Kubisme.info, Salon des Indépendants]&lt;/ref&gt; In his review published in ''La Revue des lettres et des arts'' (1 May 1908), Apollinaire claims that Braque's work is the most original presented at the salon. Even in the absence of Matisse and Picasso, Vauxcelles, in Gil Blas (20 March 1908) refers to the most innovative artists of the exposition as 'barbarous schematizers'...&amp;nbsp;who want to create an 'abstract art'.&lt;ref name="Russell T. Clement" /&gt;
* An exhibition at Galerie Notre-Dame-des-Champs (Paris) includes [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Auguste Herbin]], [[Jules Pascin]] and [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;MAM, Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, Paris 1937, L'Art Indépendant, ex. cat. {{ISBN|2-85346-044-4}}, Paris-Musées, 1987, P. 188&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1908 continues with the ''Salon de la Toison d'Or'', Moscow: Braque, Derain, Metzinger, van Dongen, Friesz, Manguin, Marquet, Matisse, Puy, Valtat and others exhibit. At the 1909 Salon d’Automne, [[Constantin Brâncuși]] exhibits with [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Fernand Léger]] and Jean Metzinger.&lt;ref name="Russell T. Clement" /&gt;

This exhibition was reviewed in the ''New York Herald'' 20 March 1908; by Vauxcelles in ''Gil Blas'' 20 March 1908; by C. Le Senne in ''Le Courrier du Soir'', 22 March 1908; and by [[Maurice Denis]], in ''La Grande revue'', 10 April 1908.&lt;ref name="Russell T. Clement" /&gt;

* Six landscapes painted at L'Estaque signed Georges Braque were presented to the Jury of the [[Salon d'Automne]]: Guérin, Marquet, Rouault and Matisse rejected Braque's entire submission. Guérin and Marquet elected to keep two in play. Braque withdrew the two in protest, placing the blame on Matisse. [[Louis Vauxcelles]] recounts how Matisse told him at the time, "Braque has just sent in a painting made of little cubes".&lt;ref name="Danchev" /&gt;

[[File:Robert Delaunay, 1909, Autoportrait, Self-portrait, oil on canvas, 73 x 59.4 cm, 28 3-4 x 23.3-8, MNAM, Pompidou Paris.png|thumb|[[Robert Delaunay]], 1909, ''Autoportrait (Self portrait)'', oil on canvas, 73 × 59.4 cm (28 3/4 × 23 3/8 in), MNAM, [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris]]
It is not known to which painting Matisse had referred, but it has been speculated to be ''[[Houses at l'Estaque]]'' (1908),&lt;ref name="Danchev" /&gt; a prototypical proto-Cubist period painting consisting both of Cézannian trees and houses depicted in the absence of any unifying perspective. Houses in the background do, however, appear smaller than those of the foreground, consistent with classical perspective.

* Following the rejection of Braque's paintings, Kahnweiler offers the artist a [[one-person show]] at his claustrophobic gallery on a small street situated behind [[La Madeleine, Paris]]. Apollinaire writes of the paintings exhibited nothing about cubes, but mentions "the synthetic motifs he paints" and that he "no longer owes anything to his surroundings". It was Vauxcelles who called Braque a daring man who despises form, "reducing everything, places and a figures and houses, to geometric schemas, to cubes.&lt;ref name="Danchev" /&gt;

===1909===
According to John Golding's influential history of Cubism published in 1959, it was at the Salon des Indépendants of 1909, held 25 March through 2 May, that the first Cubist painting was exhibited to the public: ''Little Harbor in Normandy (Petit port en Normandie)'', no. 215, entitled ''Paysage'', by Georges Braque ([[Art Institute of Chicago]]). In Room 16 hung works by Derain, Dufy, Friesz, Laprade, Matisse, Jean Puy, Rouault and Vlaminck.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

* At the 1909 Automne, [[Henri Le Fauconnier]] exhibited a proto-[[Cubism|Cubist]] portrait of the French writer, novelist and poet [[:fr:Pierre Jean Jouve|Pierre Jean Jouve]], drawing the attention of [[Albert Gleizes]] who had been working in a similar geometric style.&lt;ref name="Kubisme Automne"&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt324.html Salon d'Automne, Kubisme.info]&lt;/ref&gt; Constantin Brâncuși exhibited alongside Metzinger, Le Fauconnier and [[Fernand Léger]].&lt;ref name="Russell T. Clement" /&gt;
* The evolution towards a more rectilinear style with simplified forms continues with greater emphasis on clear geometric principles (derived from the works of Cézanne) not solely visible in the works of Braque, but too in the works of Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier and Delaunay (Picasso being absent from the salons).&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

===1910===

This painting from the collection of [[Wilhelm Uhde]] was confiscated by the French state and sold at the [[Hôtel Drouot]] in 1921]]
* At the 1910 Salon des Indépendants [[Albert Gleizes]] exhibits ''Portrait de René Arcos'' and ''[[L'Arbre, The Tree (Gleizes)|L'Arbre]]'', two paintings in which the emphasis on simplified geometric form overwhelms to a large extent the representational interest of the painting.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt; The same tendency is evident in Metzinger's ''Portrait of Apollinaire'' (1909) exhibited in the same salon. According to Apollinaire this was the "first Cubist portrait (a portrait of myself)".&lt;ref name="Anecdotiques" /&gt; Apollinaire himself has pointed out in his book ''The Cubist Painters'' (1913), Metzinger, following Picasso and Braque, was chronologically the third Cubist artist.&lt;ref name="S.

Read, University of California Press, 1 October 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Metzinger, the same year, managed to convince the jury of the Salon d'Automne to admit some highly geometric paintings into the exhibition.&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt;

According to Robert Delaunay himself, the ''Salle II'' of the 1910 Salon des Indépendants was "the first collective manifestation of a new art [un art naissant]".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Green, ''Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916-28'', Yale University Press, New Have and London, 1987 p. 314, note 51&lt;/ref&gt;

* At the Salon d'Automne of 1910, held from 1 October to 8 November, Jean Metzinger introduced an extreme form of what would soon be labeled Cubism, not just to the general public for the first time, but to other artists that had no contact with Picasso or Braque. Though others were already working in a proto-cubist vein with complex Cézannian geometries and unconventional perspectives, Metzinger's ''Nude'' represented a radical departure further still.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have in front of me a small cutting from an evening newspaper, ''The Press'', on the subject of the 1910 Salon d'Automne. It gives a good idea of the situation in which the new pictorial tendency, still barely perceptible, found itself: ''The geometrical fallacies of Messrs. Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, and Gleizes''. No sign of any compromise there. Braque and Picasso only showed in Kahnweiler's gallery and we were unaware of them. Robert Delaunay, Metzinger and Le Fauconnier had been noticed at the Salon des Indépendants of that same year, 1910, without a label being fixed on them. Consequently, although much effort has been put into proving the opposite, the word ''Cubism'' was not at that time current. (Albert Gleizes, 1925)&lt;ref name="Gleizes"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/gltexts/epic Albert Gleizes, ''The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form'', translation by Peter Brooke. Originally written by Gleizes in 1925 and published in a German version in 1928, under the title ''Kubismus'', in a series called ''Bauhausbücher'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a review of the Salon, the poet [[:fr:Roger Allard|Roger Allard]] (1885-1961) announces the appearance of a new school of French painters concentrating their attention on form rather than on color. A group forms that includes Gleizes, Metzinger, Delaunay (a friend and associate of Metzinger), and Fernand Léger. They meet regularly at Henri Le Fauconnier's studio near the Bld de Montparnasse, where he is working on his ambitious allegorical painting entitled ''L'Abondance''. "In this painting" writes Brooke, "the simplification of the representational form gives way to a new complexity in which foreground and background are united and the subject of the painting obscured by a network of interlocking geometrical elements".&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

This exhibition preceded the 1911 Salon des Indépendants which officially introduced "Cubism" to the public as an organized group movement. Metzinger had been close to Picasso and Braque, working at this time along similar lines.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

Metzinger, Henri Le Fauconnier and [[Fernand Léger]] exhibited coincidentally in Room VIII. This was the moment in which the Montparnasse group quickly grew to include [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[Alexander Archipenko]] and [[Joseph Csaky]]. The three Duchamp brothers, [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Jacques Villon]] and [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]], and another artist known as [[Francis Picabia|Picabia]] took part in the exhibition.

* Following this salon Metzinger writes the article ''Note sur la peinture'',&lt;ref name="Metzinger, 1910"&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Note sur la peinture (Note on painting)'', Pan, Paris, October–November 1910, 649-51, reprinted in Edward Fry ''Cubism'', London, 1966. Quotation of the original French have been translated by Daniel Robbins&lt;/ref&gt; in which he compares the similarities in the works Picasso, Braque, Delaunay, Gleizes and Le Fauconnier. In doing so he enunciated for the first time, not the term "Cubism", but what would become known as the characteristics of [[Cubism]]: notably the notions of [[simultaneity]] and mobile perspective. In this seminal text Metzinger stressed the distance between their works and traditional perspective. These artists, he wrote, granted themselves 'the liberty of moving around objects', and combining many different views in one image, each recording varying experiences over the course of time.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, Cubism and Culture, Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Once launched at the 1910 Salon d'Automne, the burgeoning movement would rapidly spread throughout Paris.

* After the 1910 Salon d'Automne, the writer [[Gelett Burgess]] begins a series of interviews with the avant-garde working currently in Paris and surrounding [[banlieue]]s. These interviews and Burgess' impressions of the works produced are published in ''Architectural Record, May 1910.&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess" /&gt;
* According to Gleizes' memoirs, Mercereau introduces him to Metzinger but only after the Salon d'Automne do they become seriously interested in each other's work.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;
* Louis Vauxcelles, in his review of the 26th Salon des Indépendants (1910), made a passing and imprecise reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger and Le Fauconnier, as "ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes."&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

The work of Metzinger, Le Fauconnier and Robert Delaunay were exhibited together. Le Fauconnier showed the geometrically simplified ''Ploumanac'h'' landscapes: ''Le Ravin'' and ''Village dans les Montagne'', along with ''Femme à l'éventail'' and ''Portrait of Maroussia''. In the same hall hung the works of Matisse, Vlaminck, Dufy, Laurencin, van Dongen and [[Henri Rousseau]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

==Cubism==
{{Main article|Cubism}}
"The question of when Cubism began and who led the way in its development", writes art historian Christopher Green, "is inextricably tied up with the question of what distinguishes Cubist art, how it can be defined and who can be called Cubist".&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt; Picasso's landscapes painted at ''Horta de Hebro'' in 1909 (executed two years after ''Les Demoiselles'' and one year after the "cubes" of Braque's L'Estaque paintings) were considered the first Cubist painting by Gertrude Stein. It is generally recognized, however, that the first Cubist exhibition transpired in 1911. Jean Metzinger, judging from the Burgess interview, appears to have abandoned his [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] style in favor of the ''faceting of form'' associated with analytic Cubism around 1908 or early 1909.&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt; Metzinger frequented the [[Bateau Lavoir]] at this time and exhibited with Braque at the [[Berthe Weill]] gallery. By 1910, the robust form of early analytic Cubism of Picasso (''Girl with a Mandolin, Fanny Tellier'', 1910), Braque (''Violin and Candlestick'', 1910) and Metzinger (''[[Nu à la cheminée|Nu à la cheminée (Nude)]]'', 1910) had become practically indistinguishable.&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985" /&gt;

In his article entitled ''Note sur la peinture'',&lt;ref name="Metzinger, 1910" /&gt; published the same year, Metzinger acknowledges the birth of a new kind of painting; one that employed a mobile perspective. In that seminal text, Metzinger identifies similarities in the works of [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], on the one hand, [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]] on the other. Of this group of five, only Metzinger and Braque were familiar with the works of Picasso, and Metzinger alone, familiar with the works of everyone in the group. It is now universally believed that Metzinger was the first to recognize explicitly and implicitly the significance of the use of "a free, mobile perspective", and the "mixing... of the successive and the simultaneous".&lt;ref name="Metzinger, 1910" /&gt; He was the first to write of the fact that artists had abandoned traditional perspective and were now free to move around their subjects to paint them from various points in space, and at various moments in time.&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Metzinger, 1910" /&gt; Metzinger's role at center of Cubism both as a painter and theorist prompted Guillaume Apollinaire to write of Picasso, Braque and Metzinger as the first three Cubist painters.&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt;

Now well beyond the teachings of Cézanne, the newly formed Montparnasse group (who held meetings not just at Le Fauconnier's studio, but at the cafés ''[[Le Dôme Café|Le Dôme]], [[:fr:La Coupole (brasserie)|La Coupole]], [[:fr:La Closerie des Lilas|La Closerie des Lilas]], Le Select'', and ''[[Café de la Rotonde]]'') together with other young painters who also want to emphasize a research into form (as opposed to color) take over the hanging committee of the [[Salon des Indépendants]] ensuring that the works of a small group of artists would be shown together: Gleizes, Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay, Léger and [[Marie Laurencin]] (at the request of Apollinaire) are shown in Room 41.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt;

===1911 Salon des Indépendants===
{{main article|Salon des Indépendants}}
The first group exhibition of Cubism transpired at the 1911 Indépendants.&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt; The result of the group show is a major scandal. Both the public and the press are outraged by the obscurity of the subject matter, represented as cones, cubes and spheres. The predominance of sharp geometrical faceting and the fact that a group of artists are all working in similar directions, gives rise to the term 'Cubism'. Although similar terms (i.e., "cubes") have been used before in relation to the works of Cross (1901), Metzinger and Delaunay (1906, 1907) and Braque (1908), the term "Cubism" emerges for the first time at the inauguration of the 1911 Salon des Indépendants; imposed by 'scandal-mongering journalists who wished to create sensational news' (to use the words of Gleizes). The term was used derogatorily to describe the diverse geometric concerns reflected in the paintings of five artists in continual communication with one another: Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Léger (but not Picasso or Braque, both absent from this massive exhibition).&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes ''Souvenirs, le cubisme 1908-14'', Cahiers Albert Gleizes 1 (Lyon, 1957), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guillaume Apollinaire]], deeming it necessary to deflect the endless attacks throughout the press, accepts the term ''"Cubism"'' (the "ism" signifying a tendency of behavior, action or opinion belonging to a class or group of persons (an [[art movement]]); the result of an [[ideology]] or [[principle]]).&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt;

The term "Cubisme" is employed for the first time outside France in June 1911 by Apollinaire, speaking in the context of an exhibition in Brussels which includes works by Archipenko, Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger, Segonzac, Le Fauconnier and Jean Marchand. But Jean Metzinger, who had been termed "the Emperor of Cubism" during the spring in Paris, was not among the artist exhibiting works in Brussels.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; Apollinaire’s impulse was to define ''L'Esprit nouveau'' observed in a range of paintings, from proto-Cubist quasi-Fauve landscapes to the semi-abstract geometric compositions of artists such as Metzinger, Delaunay, Gleizes and a growing group of followers. In his chapter on Picasso, however, there is no mention of the term Cubism.&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt;

Before the Indépendance, the Cubists infiltrated the placement committee to make sure they would all be shown as a group. Le Fauconnier, the secretary of the salon, facilitated the goal of hanging their works together. Until then, works had been placed according to alphabetical order of the artists names. In Room 41 hung works by Gleizes, Metzinger, Léger, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Archipenko. In room 43 hung works by [[André Lhote]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[André Dunoyer de Segonzac]], Luc-Albert Moreau and [[André Mare]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

In room 42 was a retrospective exhibition of [[Henri Rousseau|Henri (Le Douanier) Rousseau]], who died 2 September 1910. Articles and reviews were numerous and extensive in sheer words employed; including in ''Gil Blas, Comoedia, Excelsior, Action, L'Oeuvre'', and ''Cri de Paris''. Apollinaire wrote a long review in the 20 April 1911 issue of ''L'Intransigeant''.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

Henri Le Fauconnier's ''Abundance'', 1910-11 (Haags Gemeentemuseum, Den Haag), partly due to its large size and partly to the treatment of its subject matter, was an eye-catcher, causing a sensation. This painting was soon bought by the Dutchman art critic and painter Conrad Kickert (1882-1965), who was secretary of the Contemporary Art Society ([[:es:Moderne Kunstkring|Moderne Kunstkring]]). In 1934 he donated the painting to the Gemeentemuseum, Den Haag.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

===1911 Salon d'Automne===
{{main article|Salon d'Automne}}
Another Cubist scandal is produced at the Salon d'Automne of 1911. The Indépendants exhibitors develop relations with the Duchamp brothers, [[Jacques Villon]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]]. The studios of Jacques Villon and Raymond Duchamp-Villon at 7, rue Lemaître, become, together with Gleizes' studio at Courbevoie, regular meeting places for the newly formed ''Groupe de Puteaux'' (soon to exhibit under the name [[Section d'Or]]). [[František Kupka]], the Czech painter interested in [[Abstract art|non-representational]] painting based on analogies with music and the progressive abstraction of a subject in motion, joins the discussions.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

This painting was reproduced in ''Fantasio'': published 15 October 1911, for the occasion of the ''Salon d'Automne'' where it was exhibited the same year.]]

In Room 7 and 8 of the 1911 Salon d'Automne, held at the Grand Palais in Paris, hung works by Metzinger (''[[Le goûter (Tea Time)]]''), [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[André Lhote]], [[Jacques Villon]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[František Kupka]], [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Joseph Csaky]] and [[Francis Picabia]]. The result was a public scandal which brought Cubism to the attention of the general public for the second time. The first was the organized group showing by Cubists in ''Salle 41'' of the 1911 [[Salon des Indépendants]]. In room 41 hung the work of Gleizes, Metzinger, Léger, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Archipenko. Articles in the press could be found in [[Gil Blas]], Comoedia, Excelsior, Action, L'Oeuvre, Cri de Paris. Apollinaire wrote a long review in the April 20, 1911 issue of L'Intransigeant.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt; Thus Cubism spread into the literary world of writers, poets, critics, and art historians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=v2r0HrOZmCMC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=%22the+press%22+1910,+salon+d'automne&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AP0FMfXgwJ&amp;sig=nLRXYZg3us2vxH7LXlnxJvI_QuY&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20press%22%201910%2C%20salon%20d'automne&amp;f=false Douglas Cooper, ''The Cubist Epoch'', Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, N.Y., Phaidon Press, 1971]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollinaire took Picasso to the opening of the Salon d'Automne in 1911 to see the cubist works in Room 7 and 8.&lt;ref name="Kubisme Automne" /&gt;

Albert Gleizes writes of the Salon d'Automne of 1911: "With the Salon d'Automne of that same year, 1911, the fury broke out again, just as violent as it had been at the Indépendants." He writes: "The painters were the first to be surprised by the storms they had let loose without intending to, merely because they had hung on the wooden bars that run along the walls of the Cours-la-Reine, certain paintings that had been made with great care, with passionate conviction, but also in a state of great anxiety."&lt;ref name="Gleizes" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was from that moment on that the word ''Cubism'' began to be widely used. [...]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Never had the critics been so violent as they were at that time. From which it became clear that these paintings - and I specify the names of the painters who were, alone, the reluctant causes of all this frenzy: Jean Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay and myself - appeared as a threat to an order that everyone thought had been established forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In nearly all the papers, all composure was lost. The critics would begin by saying: ''there is no need to devote much space to the Cubists, who are utterly without importance'' and then they furiously gave them seven columns out of the ten that were taken up, at that time, by the Salon. (Gleizes, 1925)&lt;ref name="Gleizes" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reviewing the Salon d'Automne of 1911, Huntly Carter in ''The New Age'' writes that "art is not an accessory to life; it is life itself carried to the greatest heights of personal expression." Carter continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was at the Salon d'Automne, amid the Rhythmists [Cubists], I found the desired sensation. The exuberant eagerness and vitality of their region, consisting of two room remotely situated, was a complete contrast to the morgue I was compelled to pass through in order to reach it. Though marked by extremes, it was clearly the starting point of a new movement in painting, perhaps the most remarkable in modern times, It revealed not only that artists are beginning to recognise the unity of art and life, but that some of them have discovered life is based on rhythmic vitality, and underlying all things is the perfect rhythm that continues and unites them. Consciously, or unconsciously, many are seeking for the perfect rhyth, and in so doing are attaining a liberty or wideness of expression unattained through several centuries of painting.

Gleizes and Metzinger render homage to Cézanne in their 1912 Cubist manifesto ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'':

:"To understand Cézanne is to foresee Cubism. Henceforth we are justified in saying that between this school and previous manifestations there is only a difference of intensity, and that in order to assure ourselves of this we have only to study the methods of this realism, which, departing from the superficial reality of Courbet, plunges with Cézanne into profound reality, growing luminous as it forces the unknowable to retreat.

RaptorX is among the most popular methods for protein structure prediction. Like other remote homology recognition/protein threading techniques, RaptorX is able to regularly generate reliable protein models when the widely used [[BLAST|PSI-BLAST]] cannot. However, RaptorX is also significantly different from those profile-based methods (e.g., [[HHpred / HHsearch]] and [[Phyre / Phyre2]]) in that RaptorX excels at modeling of protein sequences without a large number of sequence homologs by exploiting structure information. RaptorX Server has been designed to ensure a user-friendly interface for users inexpert in protein structure prediction methods.

== Description ==

The RaptorX project was started in 2008 and RaptorX Server&lt;ref name=RaptorXServer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Källberg|first=Morten |author2=Haipeng Wang |author3=Sheng Wang |author4=Jian Peng |author5=Zhiyong Wang |author6=Hui Lu |author7=Jinbo Xu|title=Template-based protein structure modeling using the RaptorX web server|journal=Nature Protocols|date=July 2012|volume=7|pages=1511–1522|doi=10.1038/nprot.2012.085|pmid=22814390|url=http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v7/n8/full/nprot.2012.085.html|issue=8 |pmc=4730388}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was released to the public in 2011.

== Standard usage ==

After pasting a protein sequence into the RaptorX submission form, a user will typically wait a couple of hours (depending on sequence length) for a prediction to complete. An email is sent to the user together with a link to a web page of results. RaptorX Server currently generates the following results: 3-state and 8-state secondary structure prediction, sequence-template alignment, 3D structure prediction, solvent accessibility prediction, disorder prediction and binding site prediction. The predicted results are displayed to support visual examination. The result files are also available for download.

RaptorX Server also produces some confidence scores indicating the quality of the predicted 3D models (in the absence of their corresponding native structures). For example, it produces P-value for relative global quality of a 3D model, [[Global distance test|GDT (Global Distance Test)]] and uGDT (unnormalized-GDT) for absolute global quality of a 3D model and per-position [[RMSD]] for absolute local quality at each residue of a 3D model.

Below are some screenshots of RaptorX Server.

== Applications and performance ==
Applications of RaptorX include protein structure prediction, function prediction, protein sequence-structure alignment, evolutionary classification of proteins, guiding [[site-directed mutagenesis]] and solving protein crystal structures by [[molecular replacement]]. In the [[CASP]]9 blind protein structure prediction experiment, RaptorX was ranked 2nd out of about 80 automatic structure prediction servers. RaptorX also generated the best alignments for the 50 hardest [[CASP]]9 TBM(template-based modeling) targets. in [[CASP]]10, RaptorX is the only server group among the top 10 human/server groups for the 15 most difficult [[CASP]]10 TBM targets.

== History ==
RaptorX is the successor to the [[RAPTOR]] protein structure prediction system. RAPTOR was designed and developed by Dr. Jinbo Xu and Dr. Ming Li at the University of Waterloo. RaptorX was designed and developed by a research group led by Prof. Jinbo Xu at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago.

[[Image:Cologne Cathedral-imp01.jpg|thumb|The high choir of [[Cologne Cathedral]] (1248&amp;ndash;1322) is considered one of the finest Rayonnant structures of the Middle Ages.]]
In French Gothic architecture, '''Rayonnant''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁɛjɔnɑ̃}}) was the period between c. 1240 and 1350, characterized by a shift in focus away from the [[High Gothic]] mode of utilizing great scale and spatial rationalism (such as with buildings like [[Chartres Cathedral]] or the nave of [[Amiens Cathedral]]) towards a greater concern for two dimensional surfaces and the repetition of decorative motifs at different scales. After the mid-14th century, Rayonnant gradually evolved into the [[International Gothic|Late Gothic]] [[Flamboyant]] style, although the point of transition is not clearly defined.

==Terminology==
The name ''Rayonnant'' derives from the attempts of 19th-century French art historians (notably [[Henri Focillon]] and Ferdinand de Lasteyrie) to classify Gothic styles on the basis of window tracery. Although such efforts are now regarded as mistaken, the resulting terms have to some extent survived (Rayonnant and [[Flamboyant Gothic|Flamboyant]] are still widely used by art historians, though the misleading old term ''Lancet Gothic'' has generally given way to ''High Gothic''). On this basis, Focillon and his colleagues adopted the term ''Rayonnant'' (from the French word meaning "radiating") specifically to describe the radiating spokes of the [[rose windows]] which flourished during this period. (Some sources incorrectly derive the term from the radiating chapels spreading from the [[apse]], but these were not specifically associated with this period and had been a standard feature of Continental architecture since the 11th century on Romanesque buildings like [[Cluny Abbey]] and the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]])

==Origins and development==
[[Image:Porche.eglise.Saint.Nicaise.Reims.2.png|thumb|left|Reconstructed view of the portal of St Nicaise, Reims]]
Although elements of the new style can be found at the Cistercian abbey church of [[Royaumont]] (begun 1228, now mostly destroyed), perhaps the most important step in the development of the Rayonnant style was the building of the Abbey Church of [[Nicasius of Rheims|St Nicaise]], in [[Reims]] (begun 1231). Although this church was entirely destroyed during the French Revolution, its facade is well known from 18th-century engravings. The architect ([[Hugues Libergier]]) took various existing elements of the Gothic decorative vocabulary and used them to create a very new visual aesthetic. Perhaps the most influential feature of the Church of St Nicaise was its west facade, constructed as a series of pointed gables decorated with [[crockets]] and a mixture of blind and open [[tracery]], interspersed with narrow pinnacles. Unlike earlier Gothic west facades, with their clear three-part horizontal and vertical divisions, Libergier's design was more screen-like (indeed it may have been inspired by earlier [[choir screens]]) and on a far more human scale than the cavernous doorways of [[Reims Cathedral]]. Several key elements of the St Nicaise facade were soon taken up by other architects and can be recognised, for example, in the treatment of the North [[transept]] portal of [[Notre Dame de Paris]] and around the roof line of the [[Sainte Chapelle]].

==General characteristics==
Whilst all phases of [[Gothic architecture]] were concerned to some degree with levels of illumination and the appearance of structural lightness, Rayonnant takes this to the extreme. More of the wall surface than ever before was pierced by windows (see for example the [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in [[Paris]]) and buildings were often given lace-like tracery screens on the exterior to hide the bulk of load bearing wall elements and buttresses (such as at [[Strasbourg Cathedral]] or the [[Church of St Urbain, Troyes]]).

[[Image:Basilique Saint-Urbain Troyes Façade 110208.jpg|thumb|left|Façade of the [[Basilique Saint-Urbain de Troyes|Church of St Urbain, Troyes]], showing the use of gables, pinnacles and open tracery]]
As well as increasing the size of window openings, the Rayonnant period coincided with the development of the band window, in which a central strip of richly coloured stained glass is positioned between upper and lower bands of clear or [[grisaille]] glass, which allowed even more light to flood in.

Although changes in window design are the most oft-cited feature of the Rayonnant style, they were actually just one part of a more fundamental aesthetic shift. The key precursor was a change in the construction of window [[tracery]]; the replacement of old-fashioned ''plate-tracery'' (in which the window openings look as if they have been punched out of a flat stone plate) with the more delicate ''bar-tracery'' (in which the stone elements separating the glazing panels within a window are constructed out of narrow carved mouldings, with rounded inner and outer profiles). Bar-tracery probably made its first appearance in the clerestory windows at [[Reims Cathedral]] and quickly spread across Europe. As well as being a more effective and flexible way of constructing windows, bar tracery also paved the way for the development of blind tracery (decorating an otherwise blank wall) and of open tracery, typically all using the same decorative motifs as the adjoining windows. 
[[Image:Basilica di saint Denis vetrata 06.JPG|thumb|right|Bar tracery and glazed triforium in the nave of St Denis (the windows themselves are 19th-century replacements)]]
The final architectural innovation that emerged as part of the Rayonnant style in France was the use of glazed triforia. Traditionally, the [[triforium]] of an Early or High Gothic cathedral was a dark horizontal band, usually housing a narrow passageway, that separated the top of the arcade from the clerestory. Although it made the interior darker, it was a necessary feature to accommodate the sloping lean-to roofs over the side aisles and chapels. The Rayonnant solution to this, as employed to brilliant effect in the 1230s nave of the [[Abbey Church of St Denis]], was to use double-pitched roofs over the aisles, with hidden gutters to drain off the rain-water. This meant the outer wall of the triforioum passage could now be glazed, and the inner wall reduced to slender bar tracery. Architects also began to emphasise the linkage between triforium and clerestory by extending the central mullions from the windows of the latter in a  continuous moulding running from the top of the windows down through the blind tracery of the triforium to the string course at the top of the arcading.

==Influences==
[[File:Doorscath.jpg|thumb|[[Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque|Saint Nicholas's Cathedral]], [[Famagusta]]]]
Key elements of the Rayonnant style were incorporated into English architecture with the rebuilding of [[Westminster Abbey]] by [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]], who had been present at the consecration of Louis IX's Ste Chapelle. The resulting mixture of styles at Westminster (a crucial step in the development of English Decorated Gothic) has been characterised by some art historians as "French architecture with an English accent". Rayonnant was also very influential in the Holy Roman Empire, as evidenced by the cathedrals at Strasbourg, Cologne and Prague. In Spain we find the best examples in the [[León Cathedral]] and the [[Burgos cathedral]], this last one quite modified in the time of [[Flamboyant]] Gothic. The style even reached as far as [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]] (a French cultural outpost during the Middle Ages) with the most prominent example being [[Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque|Saint Nicholas's Cathedral]] in [[Famagusta]].

The various decorative elements employed in the Rayonnant style (bar tracery, blind and open tracery, gables and pinnacles) could also be applied on a much smaller scale, both for the micro-architectural fixtures and fittings within a church (tombs, shrines, pulpits, sacrament houses, etc.) and also for small portable objects like reliquaries, liturgical equipment, ivory diptychs, etc. This combination of flexibility and portability may have been a key factor in the dissemination of Rayonnant and its various offshoots across Europe in the late 13th and early 14th centuries.
[[Image:Ivory adoration crucifixion MRR424.jpg|thumb|left|Typically Rayonnant pierced gables and open tracery employed as a micro-architectural framing device in an ivory diptych]]

The transition (in France) from Rayonnant to Flamboyant Gothic was gradual and evolutionary in form, marked primarily by a shift towards new tracery patterns based on S-shaped curves (these curves resemble flickering flames, from which the new style got its name). However, amidst the chaos of the [[Hundred Years War]] and the various other misfortunes experienced by Europe during the 14th century, relatively little large scale construction occurred and certain elements of the Rayonnant style remained in vogue well into the next century.

{{refimprove|date=June 2008}}
A '''reaction engine''' is an [[engine|engine or motor]] that produces [[thrust]] by expelling [[reaction mass]], in accordance with [[Newton's third law of motion]]. This law of motion is most commonly paraphrased as: "For every action force there is an equal, but opposite, reaction force."

Examples include [[jet engine]]s, [[rocket engine]]s, and more uncommon variations such as [[Hall effect thruster]]s, [[ion drive]]s, [[mass drivers]], and [[nuclear pulse propulsion]].

==Energy use==

===Propulsive efficiency===
{{main|propulsive efficiency}}
For all reaction engines that carry on-board propellant (such as [[rocket engine]]s and [[electric propulsion]] drives) some energy must go into accelerating the reaction mass. Every engine wastes some energy, but even assuming 100% efficiency, the engine needs energy amounting to

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} MV_e^2&lt;/math&gt;

(where M is the mass of propellent expended and &lt;math&gt;V_e&lt;/math&gt; is the exhaust velocity), which is simply the energy to accelerate the exhaust.

[[Image:Propulsive efficiency.png|thumb|right|Due to energy carried away in the exhaust the energy efficiency of a reaction engine varies with the speed of the exhaust relative to the speed of the vehicle, this is called [[propulsive efficiency]], blue is the curve for rocket-like reaction engines, red is for air-breathing (duct) reaction engines]]
Comparing the rocket equation (which shows how much energy ends up in the final vehicle) and the above equation (which shows the total energy required) shows that even with 100% engine efficiency, certainly not all energy supplied ends up in the vehicle - some of it, indeed usually most of it, ends up as kinetic energy of the exhaust.

If the [[specific impulse]] (&lt;math&gt;I_{sp}&lt;/math&gt;) is fixed, for a mission delta-v, there is a particular &lt;math&gt;I_{sp}&lt;/math&gt; that minimises the overall energy used by the rocket. This comes to an exhaust velocity of about ⅔ of the mission delta-v (see [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation#Energy|the energy computed from the rocket equation]]). Drives with a specific impulse that is both high and fixed such as Ion thrusters have exhaust velocities that can be enormously higher than this ideal, and thus end up powersource limited and give very low thrust. Where the vehicle performance is power limited, e.g. if [[solar energy|solar power]] or nuclear power is used, then in the case of a large &lt;math&gt;v_{e}&lt;/math&gt; the maximum acceleration is inversely proportional to it. Hence the time to reach a required delta-v is proportional to &lt;math&gt;v_{e}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the latter should not be too large.

On the other hand, if the exhaust velocity can be made to vary so that at each instant it is equal and opposite to the vehicle velocity then the absolute minimum energy usage is achieved. When this is achieved, the exhaust stops in space {{note|frames||}} and has no kinetic energy; and the propulsive efficiency is 100% all the energy ends up in the vehicle (in principle such a drive would be 100% efficient, in practice there would be thermal losses from within the drive system and residual heat in the exhaust). However, in most cases this uses an impractical quantity of propellant, but is a useful theoretical consideration.

Some drives (such as [[Variable specific impulse magnetoplasma rocket|VASIMR]] or [[electrodeless plasma thruster]]) actually can significantly vary their exhaust velocity. This can help reduce propellant usage and improve acceleration at different stages of the flight. However the best energetic performance and acceleration is still obtained when the exhaust velocity is close to the vehicle speed. Proposed ion and plasma drives usually have exhaust velocities enormously higher than that ideal (in the case of VASIMR the lowest quoted speed is around 15&amp;nbsp;km/s compared to a mission delta-v from high Earth orbit to Mars of about [[Delta-v#Delta-vs around the Solar System|4&amp;nbsp;km/s]]).

For a mission, for example, when launching from or landing on a planet, the effects of gravitational attraction and any atmospheric drag must be overcome by using fuel. It is typical to combine the effects of these and other effects into an effective mission [[delta-v]]. For example, a launch mission to low Earth orbit requires about 9.3–10&amp;nbsp;km/s delta-v. These mission delta-vs are typically numerically integrated on a computer.

===Cycle efficiency===
All reaction engines lose some energy, mostly as heat.

Different reaction engines have different efficiencies and losses. For example, rocket engines can be up to 60-70% energy efficient in terms of accelerating the propellant. The rest is lost as heat and thermal radiation, primarily in the exhaust.

===Oberth effect===
{{main|Oberth effect}}
Reaction engines are more energy efficient when they emit their reaction mass when the vehicle is travelling at high speed.

This is because the useful mechanical energy generated is simply force times distance, and when a thrust force is generated while the vehicle moves, then:

:&lt;math&gt;E = F \times d \;&lt;/math&gt;

where F is the force and d is the distance moved.

Dividing by length of time of motion we get:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac E t = P =  \frac {F \times d} t = F \times v&lt;/math&gt;

Hence:

:&lt;math&gt; P = F \times v \;&lt;/math&gt;

where P is the useful power and v is the speed.

Hence, v should be as high as possible, and a stationary engine does no useful work.&lt;ref group=NB&gt;Note, that might seem to suggest that a stationary engine would not start to move. However, at low speeds the amount of energy needed to start to move tends to zero faster than the power does. So in practice it does move, as you would expect.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''register file''' is an array of [[processor register]]s in a [[central processing unit]] (CPU). Modern [[integrated circuit]]-based register files are usually implemented by way of fast [[static RAM]]s with multiple ports.  Such RAMs are distinguished by having dedicated read and write ports, whereas ordinary multiported SRAMs will usually read and write through the same ports.

The [[instruction set architecture]] of a CPU will almost always define a set of registers which are used to stage data between memory and the functional units on the chip.  In simpler CPUs, these ''architectural registers'' correspond one-for-one to the entries in a physical register file (PRF) within the CPU.  More complicated CPUs use [[register renaming]], so that the mapping of which physical entry stores a particular architectural register changes dynamically during execution.&lt;ref name="cpurfreference"&gt;"[https://www.academia.edu/25858039/A_Survey_of_Techniques_for_Designing_and_Managing_CPU_Register_File A Survey of Techniques for Designing and Managing CPU Register File]", Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  The register file is part of the [[instruction set architecture|architecture]] and visible to the programmer, as opposed to the concept of transparent [[CPU cache|caches]].

== Register bank switching ==
Register files may be clubbed together as register banks.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wikibooks: Microprocessor Design/Register File#Register Bank]].
&lt;/ref&gt; Some processors have several register banks.

ARM processors use [[ARM architecture#Registers|ARM register banks]] for [[fast interrupt request]]. [[x86]] processors use context switching and fast interrupt for switching between instruction, decoder, GPRs and register files, if there is more than one, before the instruction is issued, but this is only existing on processors that support superscalar. However, context switching is a totally different mechanism to ARM's register bank within the registers.

The [[MODCOMP]] and the later [[Intel MCS-51#Registers|8051-compatible processors]] use bits in the program status word to select the currently active register bank.

== Implementation ==
[[Image:regfile array.png|right]]
The usual layout convention is that a simple array is read out vertically.  That is, a single word line, which runs horizontally, causes a row of [[bit cell]]s to put their data on bit lines, which run vertically.  [[Sense amplifier|Sense amps]], which convert low-swing read bitlines into full-swing logic levels, are usually at the bottom (by convention).  Larger register files are then sometimes constructed by tiling mirrored and rotated simple arrays.

Register files have one word line per entry per port, one bit line per bit of width per read port, and two bit lines per bit of width per write port.  Each bit cell also has a Vdd and Vss.  Therefore, the wire pitch area increases as the square of the number of ports, and the transistor area increases linearly.&lt;ref name="janssen" &gt;

p. 171-173.
&lt;/ref&gt;
At some point, it may be smaller and/or faster to have multiple redundant register files, with smaller numbers of read ports, rather than a single register file with all the read ports. The [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] [[R8000]]'s [[integer (computer science)|integer]] unit, for example, had a 9 read 4 write port 32 entry 64-bit register file implemented in a 0.7&amp;nbsp;µm process, which could be seen when looking at the chip from arm's length.

Two popular approaches to dividing registers into multiple register files are the distributed register file configuration and the partitioned register file configuration.&lt;ref name="janssen" /&gt;

In principle, any operation that could be done with a 64-bit-wide register file with many read and write ports could be done with a single 8-bit-wide register file with a single read port and a single write port. However, the [[bit-level parallelism]] of wide register files with many ports allows them to run much faster and thus, they can do operations in a single cycle that would take many cycles with fewer ports or a narrower bit width or both.&lt;ref name="cpurfreference"/&gt;

The width in bits of the register file is usually the number of bits in the [[Word (data type)|processor word size]].
Occasionally it is slightly wider in order to attach "extra" bits to each register, such as the poison bit.
If the width of the data word is different than the width of an address—or in some cases, such as the [[68000]], even when they are the same width—the address registers are in a separate register file than the data registers.

===Decoder===
* The decoder is often broken into pre-decoder and decoder proper.
* The decoder is a series of AND gates that drive word lines.
* There is one decoder per read or write port. If the array has four read and two write ports, for example, it has 6 word lines per bit cell in the array, and six AND gates per row in the decoder. Note that the decoder has to be pitch matched to the array, which forces those AND gates to be wide and short

===Array===
[[Image:regfile cell.png|right|frame| A typical register file -- "triple-ported", able to read from 2 registers and write to 1 register simultaneously -- is made of bit cells like this one.]]
The basic scheme for a bit cell:
* State is stored in pair of inverters. 
* Data is read out by nmos transistor to a bit line.
* Data is written by shorting one side or the other to ground through a two-nmos stack.
* So: read ports take one transistor per bit cell, write ports take four.
Many optimizations are possible:
* Sharing lines between cells, for example, Vdd and Vss.
* Read bit lines are often precharged to something between Vdd and Vss.
* Read bit lines often swing only a fraction of the way to Vdd or Vss.  A sense amplifier converts this small-swing signal into a full logic level.  Small swing signals are faster because the bit line has little drive but a great deal of parasitic capacitance.
* Write bit lines may be braided, so that they couple equally to the nearby read bitlines.  Because write bitlines are full swing, they can cause significant disturbances on read bitlines.
* If Vdd is a horizontal line, it can be switched off, by yet another decoder, if any of the write ports are writing that line during that cycle.  This optimization increases the speed of the write.
* Techniques that reduce the energy used by register files are useful in [[low-power electronics]]&lt;ref&gt;

==Microarchitecture==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}{{Cleanup|section|reason=poor English|date=June 2016}}Most register files make no special provision to prevent multiple write ports from writing the same entry simultaneously.  Instead, the instruction scheduling hardware ensures that only one instruction in any particular cycle writes a particular entry. If multiple instructions targeting the same register are issued, all but one have their write enables turned off.

The crossed inverters take some finite time to settle after a write operation, during which a read operation will either take longer or return garbage.  It is common to have bypass multiplexers that bypass written data to the read ports when a simultaneous read and write to the same entry is commanded.  These bypass multiplexers are often part of a larger bypass network that forwards results which have not yet been committed between functional units.

The register file is usually pitch-matched to the [[datapath]] that it serves.  Pitch matching avoids having many busses passing over the datapath turn corners, which would use a lot of area.  But since every unit must have the same bit pitch, every unit in the datapath ends up with the bit pitch forced by the widest unit, which can waste area in the other units.  Register files, because they have two wires per bit per write port, and because all the bit lines must contact the silicon at every bit cell, can often set the pitch of a datapath.

Area can sometimes be saved, on machines with multiple units in a datapath, by having two datapaths side-by-side, each of which has smaller bit pitch than a single datapath would have.  This case usually forces multiple copies of a register file, one for each datapath.

The [[Alpha 21264]] (EV6), for instance,  was the first large micro-architecture to implement "Shadow Register File Architecture". It had two copies of the integer register file and two copies of floating point register that locate in its front end (future and scaled file, each contain 2 read and 2 write port), and took an extra cycle to propagate data between the two during context switch.  The issue logic attempted to reduce the number of operations forwarding data between the two and greatly improved its integer performance and help reduce the impact of limited number of GPR in superscalar and speculative execution. The design was later adapted by [[SPARC]], [[MIPS Technologies|MIPS]] and some later x86 implementation.

The [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] uses multiple register file as well,  R8000 floating-point unit had two copies of the floating-point register file, each with four write and four read ports, and wrote both copies at the same time with context switch. However it does not support integer operation and integer register file still remain one. Later shadow register file was abandoned in newer design in favor of embedded market.

The [[SPARC]] uses "Shadow Register File Architecture" as well for its high end line, It had up to 4 copies of  integer register files (future, retired, scaled, scratched, each contain 7 read 4 write port) and 2 copies of floating point register file. but unlike Alpha and x86, they are locate in back end as retire unit right after its Out of Order Unit and renaming register files and do not load instruction during instruction fetch and decoding stage and context switch is needless in this design.

IBM uses the same mechanism as many major microprocessors, deeply merging the register file with the decoder but its register file are work independently by the decoder side and do not involve context switch, which is different from Alpha and x86. most of its register file not just serve for its dedicate decoder only but up to the thread level.  For example, [[POWER8]] has up to 8 instruction decoders, but up to 32 register files of 32 general purpose registers each (4 read and 4 write port), to facilitate [[simultaneous multithreading]], which its instruction cannot be used cross any other register file (lack of context switch.).

In the [[x86]] processor line, a typical pre-486 CPU did not have an individual register file, as all general purpose register were directly work with its decoder, and the x87 push stack was located within the floating-point unit itself. Starting with [[Pentium]], a typical Pentium-compatible x86 processor is integrated with one copy of the single-port architectural register file containing 8 architectural registers, 8 control registers, 8 debug registers, 8 condition code registers, 8 unnamed based register,{{clarify|date=September 2015}} one instruction pointer, one flag register and 6 segment registers in one file.

One copy of 8 x87 FP push down stack by default, [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]] register were virtually simulated from x87 stack and require x86 register to supplying MMX instruction and aliases to exist stack. On P6, the instruction independently can be stored and executed in parallel in early pipeline stages before decoding into [[micro-operations]] and renaming in out-of-order execution. Beginning with [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6]], all register files do not require additional cycle to propagate the data, register files like architectural and floating point are located between code buffer and decoders, called "retire buffer", Reorder buffer and OoOE and connected within the ring bus (16&amp;nbsp;bytes). The register file itself still remains one x86 register file and one x87 stack and both serve as retirement storing. Its x86 register file increased to dual ported to increase bandwidth for result storage. Registers like debug/condition code/control/unnamed/flag were stripped from the main register file and placed into individual files between the micro-op ROM and instruction sequencer. Only inaccessible registers like the segment register are now separated from the general-purpose register file (except the instruction pointer); they are now located between the scheduler and instruction allocator, in order to facilitate register renaming and out-of-order execution. The x87 stack was later merged with the floating-point register file after a 128-bit XMM register debuted in Pentium III, but the XMM register file is still located separately from x86 integer register files.

Later P6 implementations (Pentium M, Yonah) introduced "Shadow Register File Architecture" that expanded to 2 copies of dual ported integer architectural register file and consist with context switch (between future&amp;retirered file and scaled file using the same trick that used between integer and floating point). It was in order to solve the register bottleneck that exist in x86 architecture after micro op fusion is introduced, but it is still have 8 entries 32&amp;nbsp;bit architectural registers for total 32 bytes in capacity per file (segment register and instruction pointer remain within the file, though they are inaccessible by program) as speculative file. The second file is served as a scaled shadow register file, which without context switch the scaled file cannot store some instruction independently. Some instruction from SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3 require this feature for integer operation, for example instruction like PSHUFB, PMADDUBSW, PHSUBW, PHSUBD, PHSUBSW, PHADDW, PHADDD, PHADDSW would require loading EAX/EBX/ECX/EDX from both of register file, though it was uncommon for x86 processor to take use of another register file with same instruction; most of time the second file is served as a scale retirered file. The Pentium M architecture still remains one dual-ported FP register file (8 entries MM/XMM) shared with three decoder and FP register does not have shadow register file with it as its Shadow Register File Architecture did not including floating point function. Processor after P6, the architectural register file are external and locate in processor's backend after retired, opposite to internal register file that are locate in inner core for register renaming/reorder buffer. However, in Core 2 it is now within a unit called "register alias table" RAT, located with instruction allocator but have same size of register size as retirement. [[Core (microarchitecture)|Core 2]] increased the inner ring bus to 24&amp;nbsp;bytes (allow more than 3 instructions to be decoded) and extended its register file from dual ported (one read/one write) to quad ported (two read/two write), register still remain 8 entries in 32&amp;nbsp;bit and 32&amp;nbsp;bytes (not including 6 segment register and one instruction pointer as they are unable to be access in the file by any code/instruction) in total file size and expanded to 16 entries in x64 for total 128&amp;nbsp;bytes size per file. From Pentium M as its pipeline port and decoder increased, but they're located with allocator table instead of code buffer. Its FP XMM register file are also increase to quad ported (2 read/2 write), register still remain 8 entries in 32&amp;nbsp;bit and extended to 16 entries in x64 mode and number still remain 1 as its shadow register file architecture is not including floating point/SSE functions.

In later x86 implementations, like [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem]] and later processors, both integer and floating point registers are now incorporated into a unified octa-ported (six read and two write) general-purpose register file (8 + 8 in 32-bit and 16 + 16 in x64 per file), while the register file extended to 2 with enhanced "Shadow Register File Architecture" in favorite of executing [[hyper threading]] and each thread uses independent register files for its decoder. Later [[Sandy bridge]] and onward replaced shadow register table and architectural registers with much large and yet more advance physical register file before decoding to the reorder buffer. Randered that Sandy Bridge and onward no longer carry an architectural register.

On the [[Bonnell (microarchitecture)|Atom]] line was the modern simplified revision of P5. It includes single copies of register file share with thread and decoder. The register file is a dual-port design, 8/16 entries GPRS, 8/16 entries debug register and 8/16 entries condition code are integrated in the same file. However it has an eight-entries 64&amp;nbsp;bit shadow based register and an eight-entries 64&amp;nbsp;bit unnamed register that are now separated from main GPRs unlike the original P5 design and located after the execution unit, and the file of these registers is single-ported and not expose to instruction like scaled shadow register file found on Core/Core2 (shadow register file are made of architectural registers and Bonnell did not due to not have "Shadow Register File Architecture"), however the file can be use for renaming purpose due to lack of out of order execution found on Bonnell architecture. It also had one copy of XMM floating point register file per thread. The difference from [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem]] is Bonnell do not have a unified register file and has no dedicated register file for its hyper threading. Instead, Bonnell uses a separate rename register for its thread despite it is not out of order. Similar to Bonnell, [[Larrabee (microarchitecture)|Larrabee]] and [[Xeon Phi]] also each have only one general-purpose integer register file, but the Larrabee has up to 16 XMM register files (8 entries per file), and the Xeon Phi has up to 128 AVX-512 register files, each containing 32 512-bit ZMM registers for vector instruction storage, which can be as big as L2 cache.

There are some other of Intel's x86 lines that don't have a register file in their internal design, [[MediaGX|Geode GX]] and [[Vortex86]] and many embedded processors that aren't [[Pentium]]-compatible or reverse-engineered early 80x86 processors. Therefore, most of them don't have a register file for their decoders, but their GPRs are used individually. [[NetBurst (microarchitecture)|Pentium 4]], on the other hand, does not have a register file for its decoder, as its x86 GPRs didn't exist within its structure, due to the introduction of a physical unified renaming register file (similar to Sandy Bridge, but slightly different due to the inability of Pentium 4 to use the register before naming) for attempting to replace the architectural register file and skip the x86 decoding scheme. Instead it uses SSE for integer execution and storage before the ALU and after result, SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3 use the same mechanism as well for its integer operation.

[[AMD]]'s early design like K6 do not have a register file like Intel and do not support "Shadow Register File Architecture" as its lack of context switch and bypass inverter that are necessary require for a register file to function appropriately. Instead they use a separate GPRs that directly link to a rename register table for its OoOE CPU with a dedicated integer decoder and floating decoder. The mechanism is similar to Intel's pre-Pentium processor line. For example, the [[AMD K6|K6]] processor has four int (one eight-entries temporary scratched register file + one eight-entries future register file + one eight-entries fetched register file + an eight-entries unnamed register file) and two FP rename register files (two eight-entries x87 ST file one goes fadd and one goes fmov) that directly link with its x86 EAX for integer renaming and XMM0 register for floating point renaming, but later [[AMD K7|Athlon]] included "shadow register" in its front end, it's scaled up to 40 entries unified register file for in order integer operation before decoded, the register file contain 8 entries scratch register + 16 future GPRs register file + 16 unnamed GPRs register file. In later AMD designs it abandons the shadow register design and favored to K6 architecture with individual GPRs direct link design. Like [[AMD Phenom|Phenom]], it has three int register files and two SSE register files that are located in the physical register file directly linked with GPRs. However, it scales down to one integer + one floating-point on [[Bulldozer (microarchitecture)|Bulldozer]]. Like early AMD designs, most of the x86 manufacturers like Cyrix, VIA, DM&amp;P, and SIS used the same mechanism as well, resulting in a lack of integer performance without register renaming for their in-order CPU. Companies like Cyrix and AMD had to increase cache size in hope to reduce the bottleneck. AMD's SSE integer operation work in a different way than Core 2 and Pentium 4; it uses its separate renaming integer register to load the value directly before the decode stage. Though theoretically it will only need a shorter pipeline than Intel's SSE implementation, but generally the cost of branch prediction are much greater and higher missing rate than Intel, and it would have to take at least two cycles for its SSE instruction to be executed regardless of instruction wide, as early AMDs implementations could not execute both FP and Int in an SSE instruction set like Intel's implementation did.

Unlike [[Alpha 21264|Alpha]], [[Sparc]], and [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] that only allows one register file to load/fetch one operand at the time; it would require multiple register files to achieve superscale. The [[ARM architecture|ARM]] processor on the other hand does not integrate multiple register files to load/fetch instructions. ARM GPRs have no special purpose to the instruction set (the ARM ISA does not require accumulator, index, and stack/base points. Registers do not have an accumulator and base/stack point can only be used in thumb mode). Any GPRs can propagate and store multiple instructions independently in smaller code size that is small enough to be able to fit in one register and its architectural register act as a table and shared with all decoder/instructions with simple bank switching between decoders. The major difference between ARM and other designs is that ARM allows to run on the same general-purpose register with quick bank switching without requiring additional register file in superscalar. Despite x86 sharing the same mechanism with ARM that its GPRs can store any data individually, x86 will confront data dependency if more than three non-related instructions are stored, as its GPRs per file are too small (eight in 32&amp;nbsp;bit mode and 16 in 64&amp;nbsp;bit, compared to ARM's 13 in 32&amp;nbsp;bit and 31 in 64&amp;nbsp;bit) for data, and it is impossible to have superscalar without multiple register files to feed to its decoder (x86 code is big and complex compared to ARM). Because most x86's front-ends have become much larger and much more power hungry than the ARM processor in order to be competitive (example: Pentium M &amp; Core 2 Duo, Bay Trail). Some third-party x86 equivalent processors even became noncompetitive with ARM due to having no dedicated register file architecture. Particularly for AMD, Cyrix and VIA that cannot bring any reasonable performance without register renaming and out of order execution, which leave only Intel Atom to be the only in-order x86 processor core in the mobile competition. This was until the x86 Nehalem processor merged both of its integer and floating point register into one single file, and the introduction of a large physical register table and enhanced allocator table in its front-end before renaming in its out-of-order internal core.

== Register renaming ==
Processors that perform [[register renaming]] can arrange for each functional unit to write to a subset of the physical register file.  This arrangement can eliminate the need for multiple write ports per bit cell, for large savings in area.  The resulting register file, effectively a stack of register files with single write ports, then benefits from replication and subsetting the read ports.  At the limit, this technique would place a stack of 1-write, 2-read regfiles at the inputs to each functional unit.  Since regfiles with a small number of ports are often dominated by transistor area, it is best not to push this technique to this limit, but it is useful all the same.

== Register windows ==
The [[SPARC]] ISA defines [[register window]]s, in which the 5-bit architectural names of the registers actually point into a window on a much larger register file, with hundreds of entries.  Implementing multiported register files with hundreds of entries requires a large area.  The register window slides by 16 registers when moved, so that each architectural register name can refer to only a small number of registers in the larger array, e.g. architectural register r20 can only refer to physical registers #20, #36, #52, #68, #84, #100, #116, if there are just seven windows in the physical file.

To save area, some SPARC implementations implement a 32-entry register file, in which each cell has seven "bits".  Only one is read and writeable through the external ports, but the contents of the bits can be rotated.  A rotation accomplishes in a single cycle a movement of the register window.  Because most of the wires accomplishing the state movement are local, tremendous bandwidth is possible with little power.

This same technique is used in the [[R10000]] register renaming mapping file, which stores a 6-bit virtual register number for each of the physical registers.  In the renaming file, the renaming state is checkpointed whenever a branch is taken, so that when a branch is detected to be mispredicted, the old renaming state can be recovered in a single cycle.  (See [[Register renaming]].)
&lt;!-- To do: R10K map file had lots of ports and few bits of width, and so it used a different layout, with bit lines running parallel to word lines, and state bits being global wires running perpendicularly. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14724">'''Sexual capital''' or '''erotic capital''' is the social value an [[individual capital|individual]] or [[social group|group]] accrues, as a result of their [[sexual attractiveness]]. As with other forms of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], sexual capital is convertible, and may be useful in acquiring other forms of capital, including [[social capital]] and [[economic capital]].

== Origins ==
The term erotic capital was first used by British [[sociologist]] [[Catherine Hakim]] in the early 2000s. Hakim defined it as separate from and building upon French sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s concepts of economic, cultural and social capital. She says erotic capital is independent of class origin and therefore enables social mobility, and argues that this makes erotic capital socially subversive, which results in the prevailing power structures devaluing and trying to suppress it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Erotic Capital: The Power of Attraction in the Boardroom and the Bedroom|last = Hakim|first = Catherine|publisher = Basic Books|year = 2011|isbn = 0465027474|location = |pages = 16–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the manosphere, the parallel term ''sexual market value'' or its abbreviation ''SMV'' is often used.&lt;ref&gt;Boysen, Benjamin.

Canadian Review of Comparative Literature/Revue Canadienne de Littérature Comparée 43.3 (2016): 477-497.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

===Economic===
One economic-related definition is based on the human truth capital theory of [[Gary Becker]], and predicts that people invest rationally in exhibiting their sex appeal when they can expect a return on their investments. This he defines as a form of health capital which is itself a form of [[individual capital]].&lt;ref name="Sexual Capital"&gt;{{cite journal

Some of these attributes may be immutable, such as an individual's race or [[height]], while others may be acquired through fitness training, or artificially, through [[plastic surgery]] or a [[makeover]], etc.&lt;ref name="Green Sexual Fields Approach" /&gt; There is no single [[hegemonic]] form of erotic (sexual) capital. On the contrary, currencies of capital are quite variable, acquiring a hegemonic status in relation to the erotic preferences of highly specialized social groups that distinguish one [[sexual field]] from another. Importantly, this means that erotic capital is best conceived as a property of the field, and not an individual form of capital.&lt;ref name="Green Sexual Fields Approach" /&gt;

A second definition is developed by Hakim, treating erotic capital as the fourth personal asset. This definition is a multifaceted combination of physical and social attractiveness that goes well beyond sexual attractiveness that is the focus of the 'fields' perspective. Unlike Green's conception of sexual capital, Hakim's erotic capital is an individual capital with no necessary referent to a field.&lt;ref name="Hakim Erotic Capital" /&gt;

Extensive supporting evidence for the concept of sexual capital, defined as beauty, physical attractiveness, and good looks, is provided in [[Daniel Hamermesh]]'s latest book, ''Beauty Pays'', where he reviews the research evidence on the economic benefits of being attractive in all contexts, including higher education teaching, politics, sales and marketing, and everyday social interaction. Hamermesh assumes these economic benefits must be due to unfair discrimination, a position he takes from [[Deborah Rhode]]'s new book, ''Beauty Bias'', a feminist lawyer's critique of the social benefits that accrue to attractive people, and the disadvantages experienced by unattractive people, most particularly the [[obese]].

==Importance==
Catherine Hakim argues that erotic capital matters beyond the sexual field, and beyond private relationships. Her research suggests that erotic capital is important in the fields of [[Mass media|media]], [[politics]], [[advertising]], [[sport]]s, [[the arts]], and in everyday [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]], and consists of six elements:&lt;ref name="Hakim Erotic Capital" /&gt;

# [[Physical attractiveness|Beauty]]
# [[Sexual attraction|Sexual attractiveness]]
# Social attractiveness
# Vivaciousness and energy
# Presentation
# [[Human sexuality|Sexuality]]

Catherine Hakim's theory of erotic capital argues that erotic capital is an important fourth personal asset, alongside economic capital, cultural/human capital and social capital; that erotic capital is increasingly important in affluent modern societies; that women generally have more erotic capital than men, and that erotic capital has social benefits and privileges that benefit the female gender.&lt;ref name="Hakim Erotic Capital"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Catherine |last=Hakim |title=Erotic capital |journal=[[European Sociological Review]] |volume=26 |issue=5 |year=2010 |pages=499–518 |doi=10.1093/esr/jcq014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   This definition of erotic capital has been contested by some sociologists who reject the idea that erotic capital / sexual capital is something individuals possess, like a portable portfolio of resources, with no implicit link to the particular [[sexual field]] in which such characteristics are deemed desirable (For more, see Green, Adam Isaiah. 2013. "Erotic Capital and the Power of Desirability: Why 'Honey Money' is a Bad Collective Strategy for Remedying Gender Inequality". Sexualities 16:137-158).

Sexual capital may be related to both sexual and mental health, as when individuals with low sexual capital show diminished ability to talk about or negotiate condom use with a partner possessing greater erotic capital, and develop negative emotional states as a consequence of feeling unattractive.&lt;ref name = "Green"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi= 10.1177/002214650804900405 | last= Green | first= Adam Isaiah | title= Health and Sexual Status in an Urban Gay Enclave: An Application of the Stress Process Model | journal= Journal of Health and Social Behavior| publisher= American Sociological Association | volume= 49 | year= 2008 | pages=436–451 | postscript= &lt;!--none--&gt; | issue= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In broader theoretical terms, sexual capital is important for social theory insofar as it is one among other types of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], including [[social capital]], [[symbolic capital]], and [[cultural capital]] which influence the status accorded individual members of the larger society. Sexual capital is convertible to other forms of capital, as when actors parlay sexual capital into financial capital or social capital (e.g. [[Marilyn Monroe]]),&lt;ref name="Green Sexual Fields Approach" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hakim Erotic Capital" /&gt; or when attractive employees get raises and social connections from bringing in more customers by virtue of their looks.&lt;ref name="Prospect"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Race==
Several studies suggest that sexual capital is closely associated with [[Race (human classification)|race]] or racial stereotypes of sexual attractiveness.&lt;ref name="SocialOppression"&gt;{{cite journal

|volume=35|pages=715–729
|publisher=
|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some studies show a more complex relationship between erotic capital and race. For example, some black men are afforded high sexual status because they appeal to the fantasies of some white gay men.&lt;ref name="Green Sexual Fields Approach" /&gt;
Susan Koshy argues that Asian women have gained sexual capital in the West through glamorous accounts of western male – Asian female sexual relationships in the media and arts.&lt;ref name="Sexual Naturalization" /&gt; James Farrer argues that white men living in China have enhanced sexual capital arising out of associations of [[Whiteness studies|whiteness]] with modernity, sexual openness and mobility.&lt;ref name="Alien Sexual Capital"&gt;{{cite journal

==Class and gender==
Scholars suggest that sexual capital is closely tied to [[social class]]. Groes-Green argues that sexual capital and other forms of bodily power become important resources among disenfranchised young men in Southern Africa when their access to [[economic capital]] and jobs is diminished. Groes-Green further argues that the emergence of sexual capital is linked to [[gender]] relations, e.g. when poor young men build sexual capital by grooming their looks and improving sexual performance in order to satisfy female partners and in competition with [[middle class]] peers and older so-called '[[sugar daddy (slang term)|sugar-daddies]]'. Thus sexual capital reinforces [[masculinity]] in the face of male disempowerment, and it often develops as a response to conflict between [[hegemonic]] and subordinated masculinities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Groes-Green | first1 = Christian | year = 2009 | title = Hegemonic and subordinated masculinities: Class, violence and sexual performance among young Mozambican men | url = http://www.njas.helsinki.fi/pdf-files/vol18num4/groes-green.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nordic Journal of African Studies | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 286–304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capital portfolios==
Because desirability in a sexual field may depend on more than merely sexual attractiveness, Green (2014) develops the concept, capital portfolio, to capture the particular combination of capitals that make an individual or group more desirable than others.  Capital portfolios typically involve a combination of sexual capital with economic, cultural and social capitals. As an example, to the extent that women, on average, value financial resources (i.e., economic capital) in their male partners more than sexual capital, and men value sexual capital more than economic capital in their female partners, so one may conclude that heterosexual women and men seek out distinctive capital portfolios that include a different, gendered balance of capitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Adam Isaiah|title=Sexual Fields: Toward a Sociology of Collective Sexual Life|date=2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10571">In [[behavioral psychology]], '''stimulus control''' is a phenomenon that occurs when an organism behaves in one way in the presence of a given [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] and another way in its absence. Any stimulus that modifies behavior in this manner is referred to as a ''[[wikt:discriminative stimulus|discriminative stimulus]]''.  ''Stimulus control of behavior'' occurs when the performance of a particular behavior is controlled by the presence or absence of a discriminative stimulus. For example, the presence of a [[stop sign]] (a discriminative stimulus) at a traffic  intersection increases the probability that "braking" behavior will occur.

Some theorists believe that all behavior is under some form of stimulus control.&lt;ref name = Baum&gt;{{cite book|last=Baum|first=William M.|title=Understanding behaviorism : Behavior, culture, and evolution.|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Pub.|location=Malden, MA|isbn=140511262X|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the analysis of [[B. F. Skinner]],&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, Burrhus Frederick (1957). Verbal Behavior. Acton, MA: Copley Publishing Group. {{ISBN|1-58390-021-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Verbal Behavior|verbal behavior]] is a complicated assortment of behaviors with a variety of controlling stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skinner|first=B.F.|title=Verbal behavior|year=1992|publisher=Copley|location=Acton, Mass.|isbn=1583900217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The controlling effects of stimuli are seen in quite diverse situations and in many aspects of behavior.  For example, a stimulus presented at one time may control responses emitted immediately or at a later time; two stimuli may control the same behavior; a single stimulus may trigger behavior A at one time and behavior B at another; a stimulus may control behavior only in the presence of another stimulus, and so on. These sorts of control are brought about by a variety of methods and they play a large role in systematic accounts of behavioral processes.&lt;ref&gt;Catania, A. C. "Learning" 3rd ed, 1992, Prentice Hall, Englewoood Cliffs, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

In simple, practical situations, for example if one were training a dog using operant conditioning, optimal stimulus control might be described as follows: 
* The behavior occurs immediately when the discriminative stimulus is given.
* The behavior never occurs in the absence of the stimulus.
* The behavior never occurs in response to some other stimulus.
* No other behavior occurs in response to this stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pryor | first = Karen | title = Don't Shoot the Dog! | publisher = Ringpress Books Ltd | location = City | year = 2002 | isbn = 1-86054-238-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishing stimulus control through operant conditioning==
{{main|Operant conditioning}}

===Discrimination training===
Operant stimulus control is typically established by discrimination training.  For example, to make a light control a pigeon's pecks on a button, reinforcement only occurs following a peck to the button.  Over a series of trials the pecking response becomes more probable in the presence of the light and less probable in its absence, and the light is said to become a discriminative stimulus or S&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watanabe|first=S|author2=Sakamoto, K. |author3=Wakita, M. |title=Pigeons’ discrimination of paintings by Monet and Picasso|journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior|year=1994|volume=63|issue=2|pages=165–174|doi=10.1901/jeab.1995.63-165|pmid=16812755|pmc=1334394}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually any stimulus that the animal can perceive may become a discriminative stimulus, and many different schedules of reinforcement may be used to establish stimulus control. For example, a green light might be associated with a VR 10 schedule and a red light associated with a FI 20-sec schedule, in which case the green light will control a higher rate of response than the red light.

===Generalization===
After a discriminative stimulus is established, similar stimuli are found to evoke the controlled response. This is called ''stimulus generalization''. As the stimulus becomes less and less similar to the original discriminative stimulus, response strength declines; measurements of the response thus describe a ''generalization gradient''.

An experiment by Hanson (1959)&lt;ref name = Hanson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanson|first=H. M.|title=Effects of discrimination training on stimulus generalization|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=1959|volume=58|pages=321–334|doi=10.1037/h0042606}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an early, influential example of the many experiments that have explored the generalization phenomenon. First a group of pigeons was reinforced for pecking a disc illuminated by a light of 550&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength, and never reinforced otherwise. Reinforcement was then stopped, and a series of different wavelength lights was presented one at a time. The data were displayed as a generalization gradient: the more the wavelength differed from the trained stimulus, the fewer responses were produced.&lt;ref name="Hanson"/&gt;

Many factors modulate the generalization process. One is illustrated by the remainder of Hanson's study, which examined the effects of discrimination training on the shape of the generalization gradient. Birds were reinforced for pecking at a 550&amp;nbsp;nm light, which looks yellowish-green to human observers. The birds were not reinforced when they saw a wavelength more toward the red end of the spectrum. Each of four groups saw a single unreinforced wavelength, either 555 , 560, 570, or 590&amp;nbsp;nm, in addition to the reinforced 550 wavelength. The birds were then tested as before, with a range of unreinforced wavelengths. This procedure yielded sharper generalization gradients than did the simple generalization procedure used in the first procedure. In addition, however, Hansen's experiment showed a new phenomenon, called the "peak shift".  That is, the peak of the test gradients shifted away from the S&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;, such that the birds responded more often to a wavelength they had never seen before than to the reinforced S&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;. An earlier theory involving inhibitory and excitatory gradients partially explained the results,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spence|first=K. W.|title=The differential response in animals to stimuli varying in a single dimension|journal=Psychological Review|year=1937|volume=44|pages=430–444|doi=10.1037/h0062885}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A more detailed quantitative model of the effect was proposed by Blough (1975).&lt;ref&gt;Blough, D. S. "Steady state data and a quantitative model of operant generalization and discrimination" Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Process, 1975, 104, 3-21.)&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories have been proposed, including the idea that the peak shift is an example of relational control; that is, the discrimination was perceived as a choice between the "greener" of two stimuli, and when a still greener stimulus was offered the pigeons responded even more rapidly to that than to the originally reinforced stimulus.&lt;ref name = Rachlin&gt;{{cite book|last=Rachlin|first=Howard|title=Introduction to modern behaviorism|year=1991|publisher=W.H. Freeman|location=New York|isbn=0716721767|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Matching to sample ==

In a typical matching-to-sample task, a stimulus is presented in one location (the "sample"), and the subject chooses a stimulus in another location that matches the sample in some way (e.g., shape or color).&lt;ref&gt;Blough, D. S. "Delayed matching in the pigeon" Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, 1959, 2, 151-160&lt;/ref&gt; In the related "oddity" matching procedure,  the subject responds to a comparison stimulus that does not match the sample. These are called "conditional" discrimination tasks because which stimulus is responded to depends or is "conditional" on the sample stimulus.

The matching-to-sample procedure has been used to study a very wide range of problems.  Of particular note is the "delayed matching to sample" variation, which has often been used to study [[short-term memory]] in animals.  In this variation, the subject is exposed to the sample stimulus, and then the sample is removed and a time interval, the "delay", elapses before the choice stimuli appear.  To make a correct choice the subject has to retain information about the sample across the delay.  The length of the delay, the nature of the stimuli, events during the delay, and many other factors have been found to influence performance on this task.&lt;ref&gt;Bouton, M. E.  "Learning and Behavior: A Contemporary Synthesis" (second edition) Sunderland MA: Sinauer&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cannabinoids ==

'''Systems art''' is [[art]] influenced by [[cybernetics]], and [[systems theory]], that reflects on natural systems, social systems and social signs of the [[art world]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aat-ned.nl/wwwopac.exe?database=aat&amp;language=1&amp;TAB=&amp;%250=2583 Systems art], Dutch Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus, retrieved March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems art emerged as part of the first wave of the [[conceptual art]] movement extended in the 1960s and 1970s. Closely related and overlapping terms are ''[[Anti-form movement]]'', ''[[Cybernetic art]]'', ''Generative Systems'', ''[[Process art]]'', ''Systems aesthetic'', ''Systemic art'', ''Systemic painting'' and ''Systems sculptures''.

==Related fields of systems art==

=== Anti-form movement ===
By the early 1960s Minimalism had emerged as an abstract movement in art (with roots in [[geometric abstraction]] via [[Malevich]], [[the Bauhaus]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]) which rejected the idea of relational, and subjective painting, the complexity of [[Abstract expressionist]] surfaces, and the emotional [[zeitgeist]] and polemics present in the arena of [[Action painting]]. Minimalism argued that extreme simplicity could capture all of the sublime representation needed in art. The term '''Systematic art''' was coined by [[Lawrence Alloway]] in 1966 as a description of the method artists, such as [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Al Held]] and [[Frank Stella]],  were using for composing [[abstract painting]]s.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Chilvers, Ian and Glaves-Smith, John, ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art'', second edition (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 694. {{ISBN|0199239665}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Associated with painters such as [[Frank Stella]], minimalism in painting, as opposed to other areas, is a modernist movement. Depending on the context, minimalism might be construed as a precursor to the postmodern movement. Seen from the perspective of writers who sometimes classify it as a postmodern movement, early minimalism began and succeeded as a modernist movement to yield advanced works, but which partially abandoned this project when a few artists changed direction in favor of the anti-form movement.

In the late 1960s the term [[Postminimalism]] was coined by [[Robert Pincus-Witten]]&lt;ref&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, [[Art &amp; Auction|Art+Auction]], March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe minimalist derived art which had content and contextual overtones which minimalism rejected, and was applied to the work of [[Eva Hesse]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]] and new work by former minimalists [[Robert Smithson]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Sol LeWitt]], and Barry Le Va, and others. Minimalists like [[Donald Judd]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]] and others continued to produce their [[Late modernism|late modernist]] paintings and sculpture for the remainder of their careers.

=== Cybernetic art ===
[[File:Tsai opticalpainting.jpg|thumb|right|''Optical Painting'' by [[Wen-Ying Tsai]] (1964)]] 
Audio feedback and the use of tape loops, sound synthesis and computer generated compositions reflected a cybernetic awareness of information, systems and cycles. Such techniques became widespread in the 1960s in the music industry. The visual effects of electronic feedback became a focus of artistic research in the late 1960s, when video equipment first reached the consumer market. [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], for example, used "all manner and combination of audio and video signals to generate electronic feedback in their respective of corresponding media."&lt;ref name="RA 07"&gt;[[Edward A. Shanken]], "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott," in Roy Ascott (2003, 2007), ''Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness'', University of California, {{ISBN|0-520-22294-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With related work by Edward Ihnatowicz, [[Wen-Ying Tsai]] and cybernetician [[Gordon Pask]] and the animist kinetics of Robert Breer and [[Jean Tinguely]], the 1960s produced a strain of cybernetic art that was very much concerned with the shared circuits within and between the living and the technological. A line of cybernetic art theory also emerged during the late 1960s. Writers like Jonathan Benthall and [[Gene Youngblood]] drew on cybernetics and cybernetic. The most substantial contributors here were the British artist and theorist [[Roy Ascott]] with his essay "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision" in the journal Cybernetica (1966–67), and  the American critic and theorist [[Jack Burnham]]. In ''Beyond Modern Sculpture'' from 1968 Burnham builds cybernetic art into an extensive theory that centers on art's drive to imitate and ultimately reproduce life.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell Whitelaw (2004), ''Metacreation: Art and Artificial Life'', MIT Press, {{ISBN|0-262-23234-0}} p.17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 1968, curator Jasia Reichardt organized the landmark exhibition, Cybernetic Serendipity, at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London.

=== Generative systems ===
{{main|Generative art}}
[[File:Dombis 1687.jpg|thumb|Installation view of ''Irrational Geometrics'' 2008 by [[Pascal Dombis]]]]
Generative art is [[art]] that has been generated, composed, or constructed in an [[algorithmic art|algorithmic]] manner through the use of systems defined by [[computer]] [[software]] [[algorithms]], or similar [[mathematical]] or mechanical or [[random]]ised autonomous processes. [[Sonia Landy Sheridan]] established Generative Systems as a program at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1970 in response to social change brought about in part by the computer-robot communications revolution.&lt;ref name = "SLS 83"&gt;Sonia Landy Sheridan, "Generative Systems versus Copy Art: A Clarification of Terms and Ideas", in: ''[[Leonardo Journal|Leonardo]]'', Vol. 16, No. 2 (Spring, 1983), pp. 103-108. {{doi|10.2307/1574794}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program, which brought artists and scientists together, was an effort at turning the artist's passive role into an active one by promoting the investigation of contemporary scientific—technological systems and their relationship to art and life. Unlike copier art, which was a simple commercial spin-off, Generative Systems was actually involved in the development of elegant yet simple systems intended for creative use by the general population. Generative Systems artists attempted to bridge the gap between elite and novice by directing the line of communication between the two, thus bringing first generation information to greater numbers of people and bypassing the entrepreneur.&lt;ref name = "SLS 83"/&gt;

=== Process art ===
{{main|Process art}}
[[File:Bolognini-CIMs.JPG|thumb|right|[[Maurizio Bolognini]], ''Collective Intelligence Machines'' series (CIMs, from 2000). These are generative and interactive installations using the mobile phone network and participation technologies taken from e-democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurizio Bolognini]], "De l'interaction à la démocratie. Vers un art génératif post-digital" / [http://www.bolognini.org/lectures/amx.htm "From interactivity to democracy. Towards a post-digital generative art"], in ''Ethique, esthétique, communication technologique'', Edition L'Harmattan. Paris, 2011, pp. 229-239.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Process art is an [[artistic movement]] as well as a creative sentiment and world view where the end product of ''art'' and ''craft'', the ''[[:wikt:objet d’art|objet d’art]]'', is not the principal focus. The 'process' in process art refers to the process of the formation of art: the gathering, sorting, collating, associating, and patterning.  Process art is concerned with the actual ''doing''; art as a [[rite]], [[ritual]], and [[performance]]. Process art often entails an inherent motivation, rationale, and [[intentionality]]. Therefore, art is viewed as a creative journey or process, rather than as a deliverable or end product.
In the artistic discourse the work of [[Jackson Pollock]] is hailed as an antecedent. Process art in its employment of [[serendipity]] has a marked correspondence with [[Dada]]. Change and transience are marked themes in the process art movement. The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] states that Robert Morris in 1968 had a groundbreaking exhibition and essay defining the movement and the Museum Website states as "Process artists were involved in issues attendant to the body, random occurrences, improvisation, and the liberating qualities of nontraditional materials such as wax, felt, and latex. Using these, they created eccentric forms in erratic or irregular arrangements produced by actions such as cutting, hanging, and dropping, or organic processes such as growth, condensation, freezing, or decomposition".&lt;ref&gt;Source:  {{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200906/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} (accessed: Thursday, March 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Systemic art ===
According to Chilvers (2004) "earlier in 1966 the British art critic [[Lawrence Alloway]] had coined the term "Systemic art", to describe a type of abstract art characterized by the use of very simple standardized forms, usually geometric in character, either in a single concentrated image or repeated in a system arranged according to a clearly visible principle of organization. He considered the chevron paintings of [[Kenneth Noland]] as examples of Systemic art, and considered this as a branch of [[Minimal art]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Systemic art." The Oxford Dictionary of Art. Ed. Ian Chilvers. Oxford University Press, 2004. eNotes.com. 2006. 19 Mar, 2008 [http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/ systemic-art]&lt;/ref&gt;

John G. Harries considered a common ground in the ideas that underlie developments in 20th-century art such as [[Serial art]], Systems Art, [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and [[Kinetic art]]. These kind of arts often do not stem directly from observations of things visible in the external natural environment, but from the observation of depicted shapes and of the relationship between them.&lt;ref name = "JGH 81"&gt;John G. Harries, "Personal Computers and Notated Visual Art", in: ''[[Leonardo Journal|Leonardo]]'', Vol. 14, No. 4 (Autumn, 1981), pp. 299-301.&lt;/ref&gt; Systems art, according to Harries, represents a deliberate attempt by artists to develop a more flexible frame of reference. A style in which its frame of reference is taken as a model to be emulated rather than as a cognitive systems, that only leads to the institutionalization of the imposed model. But to transfer the meaning of a picture to its location within a systemic structure does not remove the need to define the constitutive elements of the system: if they are not defined, one will not know how to build the system.&lt;ref name = "JGH 81"/&gt;
[[Image:Roy-csnewskool.png|right|thumb|Newskool [[ASCII art]] Screenshot]]

=== Systemic painting ===
Systemic Painting, according to Auping (1989) "was the title of an highly influential exhibition at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in 1966 assembled and introduction written by [[Lawrence Alloway]] as curator. The show contained numerous works that many critics today would consider part of the [[Minimal art]]".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Auping (1989), ''Abstraction, Geometry, Painting: Selected Geometric Abstract Painting'', Albright-Knox Art Gallery, page 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In the catalogue Alloway noted, that ... "paintings, such as those in this exhibition are not, as has been often claimed, impersonal. The personal is not expunged by using a neat technique: anonymity is not a consequence of highly finishing a painting".&lt;ref name = "LA 66"&gt;Lawrence Alloway, "Systemic Painting", in: ''Minimal Art: A Critical Anthology'', by Gregory Battcock (1995). p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "systemic painting" later on has become the name for artists who employ systems make a number of aesthetic decisions before commencing 
to paint.&lt;ref&gt;John Albert Walker (1973), ''Glossary of Art, Architecture, and Design Since 1945: Terms and Labels'', p.197.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Systems sculpture ===
According to Feldman (1987) "[[serial art]], serial painting, systems sculpture and [[ABC art]], were art styles of the 1960s and 1970s in which simple geometric configurations are repeated with little or no variation. Sequences becomes important as in mathematics and linguistic context. These works rely on simple arrangements of basic volumes and voids, mechanically produced surfaces, and algebraic permutations of form. The impact on the viewer, however, is anything but simple".&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Burke Feldman (1987), ''Composition (Art)'', H.N. Abrams, {{ISBN|0-13-940602-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anthomyiidae sp. 1 (aka).jpg|thumb|Arthropods (such as flies) are the most abundant terrestrial animals by species count.]]
''' Terrestrial animals''' are [[animal]]s that live predominantly or entirely on land (e.g., [[cat]]s, [[ant]]s, [[spider]]s), as compared with [[aquatic animal]]s, which live predominantly or entirely in the water (e.g., [[fish]], [[lobster]]s, [[octopus]]es), or [[amphibian]]s, which rely on a combination of aquatic and terrestrial [[habitat]]s (e.g., [[frog]]s, or  [[newt]]s). Terrestrial invertebrates include [[ants]], [[Fly|flies]], crickets, grasshoppers and spiders.

==Terrestrial Classes==

The term terrestrial is typically applied for species that live primarily on the ground, in contrast to [[arboreal]] species, which live primarily in trees.

There are other less common terms that apply to specific groups of terrestrial animals:
*'''[[wiktionary:saxicolous|Saxicolous]]''' creatures are rock dwelling. Saxicolous is derived from the Latin word "saxum," meaning a rock. 
*'''[[wiktionary:arenicolous|Arenicolous]]''' creatures live in the sand.
*'''[[Troglofauna]]''' predominantly live in caves.

==Taxonomy==
Terrestrial invasion is one of the most important events in the [[history of life]].&lt;ref&gt;Shear WA: The early development of terrestrial ecosystems.

Biol J Linn Soc, 2000, 70:541-554.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garwood"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garwood |first1=Russell J. |last2=Edgecombe |first2=Gregory D. |date=September 2011 |title=Early Terrestrial Animals, Evolution, and Uncertainty |journal=Evolution: Education and Outreach |location=New York |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=489–501 |doi=10.1007/s12052-011-0357-y |url=https://www.academia.edu/891357/ |issn=1936-6426 |accessdate=2015-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrestrial lineages evolved in several&lt;!--refers to "seven" phyla, but see below--&gt; animal phyla, among which vertebrates, arthropods, and mollusks are representatives of more successful groups of terrestrial animals.

Terrestrial animals do not form a unified [[clade]]; rather, they share only the fact that they live on land. The transition from an aquatic to terrestrial life has evolved independently and successfully many times by various groups of animals.&lt;ref name="Garwood" /&gt; Most terrestrial lineages originated under a mild or [[tropical climate]] during the [[Paleozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]], whereas few animals became fully terrestrial during the [[Cenozoic]].

When excluding internal [[parasite]]s, free living species in terrestrial environments are represented by the following ten phyla:  [[flatworm]]s ([[planarian]]s), [[Nemertea|nemerteans]] (ribbon worms), [[Nematoda|nematodes]] (roundworms), [[rotifer]]s, [[tardigrade]]s (water bears), [[Onychophora]] (velvet worms), [[arthropod]]s, [[mollusks]] ([[gastropods]]: [[land snail]]s and [[slug]]s), [[annelid]]s and [[chordate]]s ([[tetrapods]]). Roundworms, tardigrades, and rotifers are microscopic animals that require a film of water to live in, and are not considered truly terrestrial. Flatworms, ribbon worms, velvet worms and annelids all depend on more or less moist habitats, as do the arthropods [[centipede]]s and [[millipede]]s. The three remaining phyla, arthropods, mollusks, and chordates, all contain species that have adapted totally to dry terrestrial environments, and contain species that have no aquatic phase in their life cycles.

===Difficulties===
[[File:Pygoscelis papua -Nagasaki Penguin Aquarium -swimming underwater-8a.jpg|thumb| Animals do not fall neatly into terrestrial or aquatic classification but lie along a continuum: e.g., penguins spend much of their time under water.]]
Labeling an animal species "terrestrial" or "aquatic" is often obscure and becomes a matter of judgment. Many animals considered terrestrial have a life-cycle that is partly dependent on being in water. [[Penguins]], [[Pinniped|seals]], and [[walruses]] sleep on land and feed in the ocean, yet they are all considered terrestrial. Many insects, e.g. [[mosquito]]s, and all [[terrestrial crab]]s, as well as other clades, have an aquatic life cycle stage: their eggs need to be laid in and to hatch in water; after hatching, there is an early aquatic form, either a [[nymph]] or [[larva]].

There are crab species that are completely aquatic, crab species that are amphibious, and crab species that are terrestrial. [[Fiddler crabs]] are called "semi-terrestrial" since they make burrows in the muddy substrate, to which they retreat during high tides. When the tide is out, fiddler crabs search the beach for food. The same is true in the [[mollusca]]. Many hundreds of [[gastropod]] genera and species live in intermediate situations, such as for example, [[Truncatella (gastropod)|''Truncatella'']]. Some gastropods with gills live on land, and others with a lung live in the water.

As well as the purely terrestrial and the purely aquatic animals, there are many borderline species. There are no universally accepted criteria for deciding how to label these species, thus some assignments are disputed.

==Terrestrialization==
{{main|Vertebrate land invasion}}
Fossil evidence has shown that sea creatures, likely related to arthropods, first began to make forays on to land around 530 million years ago. There is little reason to believe, however, that animals first began living reliably on land around this same time period. A more likely hypothesis is that these early arthropods' motivation for venturing on to dry land was to mate (as modern horseshoe crabs do) or lay eggs out of the reach of predators.&lt;ref&gt;MacNaughton, R. B et al. First steps on land: Arthropod trackways in Cambrian-Ordovician eolian sandstone, southeastern Ontario, Canada. Geology, 30, 391 - 394, (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; As time went on, evidence suggests that by approximately 375 million years ago&lt;ref name="Garwood" /&gt; the bony fish best adapted to life in shallow coastal/swampy waters (such as ''Tiktaalik roseae''), were much more viable as amphibians than were their arthropod predecessors. Thanks to relatively strong, muscular limbs (which were likely weight-bearing, thus making them a preferable alternative to traditional fins in extremely shallow water),&lt;ref&gt;Hohn-Schulte, Bianca, Holger Preuschoft, Ulrich Witzel, and Claudia Distler-Hoffman. "Biomechanics and Functional Preconditions for Terrestrial Lifestyle in Basal Tetrapods, with Special Consideration of ''Tiktaalik Roseae''." Historical Biology 25.2 (2013): 167-81. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; and lungs which existed in conjunction with gills, ''Tiktaalik'' and animals like it were able to establish a strong foothold on land by the end of the Devonian period. As such, they are likely the most recent common ancestor of all modern tetrapods.

== Terrestrial gastropods ==
{{main|land snail|semi-slug|slug}}
[[Gastropod]] mollusks are one of the most successful animals that have diversified in the fully terrestrial habitat.&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; They have evolved terrestrial taxa in more than nine lineages.&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; They are commonly referred to as [[land snail]]s and [[slug]]s.

Terrestrial invasion of gastropod mollusks has occurred in [[Neritopsina]], [[Cyclophoroidea]], [[Littorinoidea]], [[Rissooidea]], [[Ellobioidea]], [[Onchidioidea]], [[Veronicelloidea]]&lt;!--listed as Rathouisioidea that consist of the same two families--&gt;, [[Succineoidea]], and [[Stylommatophora]], and in particular, each of Neritopsina, Rissooidea and Ellobioidea has likely achieved land invasion more than once.&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt;

Most terrestrialization events have occurred during the [[Paleozoic]] or [[Mesozoic]].&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; Gastropods are especially unique due to several fully terrestrial and epifaunal lineages that evolved during the [[Cenozoic]].&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; Some members of rissooidean families [[Truncatellidae]], [[Assimineidae]], and [[Pomatiopsidae]] are considered to have colonized to land during the Cenozoic.&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; Most truncatellid and assimineid snails amphibiously live in [[intertidal]] and [[supratidal]] zones from [[brackish water]] to pelagic areas.&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; Terrestrial lineages likely evolved from such ancestors.&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; The [[rissooidea]]n gastropod family [[Pomatiopsidae]] is one of the few groups that have evolved fully terrestrial taxa during the late Cenozoic in the [[Japanese Archipelago]] only.&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; Shifts from aquatic to terrestrial life occurred at least twice within two Japanese endemic lineages in Japanese Pomatiopsidae and it started in the [[Late Miocene]].&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt;

About one-third of gastropod species is terrestrial.&lt;ref name="Raz 2012"/&gt; In terrestrial habitats they are subjected to daily and seasonal variation in temperature and water availability.&lt;ref name="Raz 2012"/&gt; Their success in colonizing different habitats is due to physiological, behavioral, and morphological adaptations to water availability, as well as ionic and thermal balance.&lt;ref name="Raz 2012"/&gt; They are adapted to most of the habitats on Earth.&lt;ref name="Raz 2012"/&gt; The shell of a snail is constructed of [[calcium carbonate]], but even in acidic soils one can find various species of shell-less slugs.&lt;ref name="Raz 2012"/&gt; Land-snails also live in deserts, where they must contend with heat and aridity.&lt;ref name="Raz 2012"/&gt; Terrestrial gastropods are primarily herbivores and only a few groups are carnivorous.&lt;ref name="Siriboon 2013"/&gt; Carnivorous gastropods usually feed on other gastropod species or on weak individuals of the same species; some feed on insect larvae or earthworms.&lt;ref name="Siriboon 2013"/&gt;

The TWIM consists of vertically fitted α-Chapman-type layers, with distinct F2, F1, E, and D layers, for which the layer parameters such as peak density, peak density height, and scale height are represented by surface spherical harmonics. These results are useful for providing reliable radio propagation predictions and in investigation of near-Earth space and large-scale ''Ne'' distribution with diurnal and seasonal variations, along with geographic features such as the equatorial anomaly. This way the continuity of ''Ne'' and its derivatives is also maintained for practical schemes for providing reliable radio propagation predictions.

'''Thomistic sacramental theology''' is [[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]]'s theology of the [[sacraments of the Catholic Church]]. It can be found through his writings in the ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'' and in the ''[[Summa Theologiæ]]''.  As can be seen, Aquinas relied heavily on Scriptural passages, as well as the writings of various Church Fathers.  [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] says (De Civ. Dei x): "The visible sacrifice is the sacrament.  This is the sacred sign of the invisible sacrifice.  A thing is called a sacrament, either by having a certain hidden sanctity, and in this sense a sacrament is a sacred secret;  or from having some relationship to this sanctity.  A sacrament is a sign.  Moreover, it is a sacred sign.  Divine Wisdom provides for each thing according to its mode.  [[Wisdom]] 7,1 :  "she... ordered all things sweetly";  and from [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 25,15:  "[she] gave to everyone according to his proper ability."  It is a part of human nature to acquire knowledge of the intelligible from the sensible.  A sign is the way one obtains knowledge of something else.  The sacraments are the signs by which humans gain knowledge of spiritual and intelligible goods.  [[Ephesians]] 5, 25-26:  "Christ loved the Church, and delivered Himself up for it;  that He might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life."  [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] says (Tract. xxx in John): "The word is added to the element, and this becomes the sacrament."  Augustine (Contra Faust xix):  "It is impossible to keep men together in one religious denomination, whether true or false, except they be united by means of visible signs or sacraments."  It is necessary for salvation that humans united together in the name of true religion.  Therefore, sacraments are necessary for man's salvation.  There are three reasons sacraments are necessary to the salvation of humans:  First, it is in the nature of humans to be led by things corporal and sensible to things that are spiritual and intelligible.  Second, by sinning, humans have subjected themselves to corporeal things.  Therefore, it is proper that the remedy have a corporeal side, leading to the spiritual.  Third, humans are prone to direct their activity towards material things (things that can be seen and felt).  Sacraments are made necessary because humans have sinned.  The main effect of the sacraments is grace, in particular those involving Virtues and Gifts.  Grace perfects the soul and allow participation in the Divine Nature.  Furthermore, the effects of the sacraments is justification.  This is an interior effect.  [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 8,33:  "God justifies."  Therefore, the effects of the sacraments is justification.  This is an interior effect.  The power of the sacraments is from God, alone.  It does not matter that the minister of the sacraments may be a sinner, or evil.  Augustine (commenting on [[Gospel of John|John]] 1,33):  "He upon Whom you shall see the Spirit, ...that John did not know that our Lord, having the authority of baptizing, would keep it to Himself, but that the ministry would certainly pass to both good and evil men...What is a bad minister to you, wherever the Lord is good?"

==Sacraments==
{{see also|Sacraments (Catholic Church)}}
There are seven sacraments:  [[Baptism]], [[Confirmation]], [[Holy Eucharist]], [[Penance]], [[Extreme Unction]] (Anointing of the Sick), [[Holy Orders]], [[Matrimony]].  From [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Dionysius]] (Eccl. Hier. iii): "No one receives hierarchical perfection save by the most God-like Eucharist."   Therefore, the Holy Eucharist is the greatest of the sacraments.  This is because it is the real presence of the Body and Blood of Christ.  It perfects the other sacraments.  From [[Summa Contra Gentiles]] Book 4, Chapter 58:  The spiritual remedies of salvation have been given to men under sensible signs.  In bodily life we find a twofold order:  1.)  For some propagate and order the bodily life in others. 2.)  Some are propagated and ordered in the bodily life.  In a  bodily life three things are necessary of themselves, and a fourth is incidental.  1.) Generation by birth.  2.)  Growth to arrive at due size and strength.  3.)  Nourishment is necessary.  These three are assigned to the vegetative soul.  4.)  Healing of the sick living thing.  These are mirrored in the spiritual life of the sacraments.  1.) Baptism:  spiritual generation.  2.)  Confirmation:  spiritual growth.  3.)  Eucharist:  spiritual nourishment.  4.)  Penance and Extreme Unction (Anointing of the Sick):  spiritual healing.

==Baptism==
{{see also|Baptism}}
The sacrament of [[Baptism]] has the outward sign of a washing.  "He that washes himself (baptuzatur) after touching the dead, if he touched them again, what does his washing avail?"  ([[Sirach]] 34,30).  The sacrament does not come from the water, but from the act of pouring the water, in the form of a washing.  ([[St. Hugh of Victor]] held that the water was the sacrament, but this is in error.)  The outward reality is in the washing with water, while the sacramental sign is the inward justification: this is the reality, or inward reality of the sacrament.  The inward reality is a seal and a safeguarding.  [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Dionysius]] defined Baptism by its relation to the other sacraments (Eccl. Hier.ii) that it is the principle that forms the habits of the soul for the reception of those most holy words and sacraments;  by its relation to heavenly glory, which is the universal end of all sacraments, preparing the way for us, whereby we mount to the repose of the heavenly kingdom, conferring on us our most sacred and Godlike regeneration.  The power of Baptism was initiated when Christ was Baptized, and not during the passion.  The proper way to Baptize is "I Baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit."  This comes from Matthew 28,19: "Going .... teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."  [[Ephesians]] 5,26: "Cleansing the world by the cleaning laver of the water."  [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] says (De Unico Baptismo iv) that Baptism is consecrated by the words of the Gospel.  Full immersion in water is not necessary.  It is symbolic of the inward cleansing of the sin.  [[Hebrews]] 10.22:  "Let us draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with clean water."  [[Ezekiel]]  36:25:  "25Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you."  Baptism cannot be reiterated.  [[Ephesians]] 4, 5:  "One Faith, one Baptism."  Baptism is a spiritual rebirth.  [[Gospel of John|John]] 3,5: "Unless a man is born again of water and the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven."  [[Gospel of John|John]]  3,4:  "A man cannot re-enter the womb."  Therefore, he cannot be re-Baptized.  (cf. [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 4, 3-4)  Because we are baptized in Christ's death, by which we die to sin and rise again into a newness of life.  Now, Christ died once.  Baptism imprints a character which is indelible.  Baptism is the principle remedy against [[original sin]].  Romans 5,18:  "...as by the offense of one, unto all men to condemnation, so also by the justice of one, all men are justified of life."  There are three kinds of Baptism: Baptism of water, of Blood (Martyrdom) and of the Spirit (Baptism of Desire).  Hebrews 4,2: "[Of baptism) He uses the plural, because there is Baptism of Water, of Repentance and of Blood."  [[Isaiah]] 4, 4:  "The Lord shall wash away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall wash away the blood of Jerusalem, out of the midst thereof, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning."  [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (De Unico Baptismo Parvulrum, iv): "The Blessed Cyprian argues with considerable reason from the thief to whom, though not baptized, it was said, 'Today you shall be with Me in Paradise', that suffering can take the place of Baptism.  Having weighed this again and again, I perceive that not only can suffering for the name of Christ supply what is lacking in Baptism, but even faith and conversion of heart, if perchance on account of stress of the times the celebration of the mystery of Baptism is not practicable."  Priests are the proper ministers to perform Baptism.  [[Isidore of Seville|Isidore]] (of Spain) says priests are the only ministers who can perform Baptism.  However,  even Isidore and [[Pope Gelasius I]] say that it is often permissible for Christian laymen to baptize in cases of urgency.  Women can baptize.  This was approved by [[Pope Urban II]] and from [[Colossians]] 3: "In Christ there is neither male nor female.:  Isidore indicates that even a person who is not baptized may baptize, since it is the Holy Spirit Who performs the mystery of the Baptism.  Augustine never answered this question.  But the Church has long since determined that Jews and non-baptized heretics can baptize.  It is possible to be saved even without Baptism of Water, if the person has the proper desire, and has no contempt for the Sacrament.  Baptism should not be delayed.  [[Sirach]] 5, 8: "Delay not to be converted to the Lord and defer it not from day to day."  Children of heretics and Jews should not be baptized against the will of their parents. (See [[Thought of Thomas Aquinas]] for a detailed discussion.)  It is beneficial to baptize imbeciles and madmen.  Baptism opens the gates of heaven to sinners.  [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 3,21: "Heaven was opened."  The gloss of [[Bede]] "We see here the power of Baptism;  from which when a man comes forth, the gates of the heavenly kingdom are opened to him."  Baptism has an equal effect on all.  Ephesians 4, 5:  "One Faith, One Baptism."  After one has reached the age of reason, it is necessary to receive the Baptism with sincerity.  If the Sacrament is received in bad faith, then one has a change of heart, the effects of Baptism are salutory (Augustine).  From Summa Contra Gentiles, Book 4, Chapter 59:  Bede: "Baptism opens the gates of heaven." A spiritual generation is needed only once, hence baptism is given only once.  The sin of Adam makes a man guilty only once.  Baptism is chiefly directed at this infection.  This excludes the errors of the [[Donatists]] or the [[Rebaptizers]] (Augustine).

==Confirmation==
{{see also|Confirmation (Catholic Church)}}
===''Summa Contra Gentiles''===
The following is condensed from [[Summa Contra Gentiles]], Book 4, Chapter 60:  

The perfection of spiritual strength consists in a man's daring to confess the faith of Christ in the presence of everyone.  This is done without error or confusion.  Spiritual strength drives out inordinate terror.  This is the sacrament of Confirmation.   One becomes a front line fighter for the faith of Christ.  Warriors carry the insignia of their master.  So it is with the confirmed: they carry the sign of Christ.  The signing takes place with a mixture of oil and balm which is called chrism, and not without reason.    This designated the power of the Holy Spirit.  They are called anointed ([[Psalm]] 44,8; [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 4,18).  They are called Christians [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 9,26).  This is because they are warriors under Christ.  The balm gives a pleasing fragrance, which indicates one of good public repute.  These are called forth from the recesses of the Church to the field of battle.  This sacrament is conferred only by bishops.  These are enrolled in the spiritual military forces.  Manliness is derived from Christ.

(Comment:  This is a particularly militant statement by Aquinas, something that is not uncommon in Summa Contra Gentiles.  The statement in [[Summa Theologica]] is more refined.  See infra. AEF)

===''Summa Theologiæ''===
Condensed from [[Summa Theologiæ]]: 

Concerning the institution of this sacrament there are three opinions.  [[Alexander of Hales]] (Summa Theol. PIV, Q  IX) and [[St. Bonaventure]] (IV, Sent. vii) have maintained that this sacrament was instituted neither by Christ, nor by the apostles;  but later in the course of time by one of the councils.  [[Pierre de Tarantaise]] (IV Sent. vii) held that it was instituted by the apostles.  But this cannot be admitted.  A Sacrament belongs to the power of excellence, which belongs to Christ alone.  Therefore, we must say that Christ instituted this sacrament not by bestowing, but by promising it according to [[Gospel of John|John]] 16, 7:  "If I don't leave, the Paraclete will not come to you, but if I go, I will send Him to you."  Confirmation is the sacrament of the fullness of grace.  [[Gospel of John|John]] 7,39:  "As yet the Spirit was not given, because Jesus was not yet glorified."  Chrism is a fitting natter for the Sacrament.  [[Sirach]] 24, 21:  "My odor is as the purest balm."  The proper form of the Sacrament is:  "I sign you with the sign of the cross, etc."  This is within the authority of the Church to prescribe.  It is proper to call the chrism either the oil of salvation or the oil of sanctification.  Confirmation confirms a character.  It is in the form of a consecration and cannot be repeated, once it is administered.  The character of Confirmation is the gift of the Paraclete, as promised by scripture.  It is given to the baptized to publish the faith, as strengthened by the Holy Spirit.  This is similar to what occurred with the Apostles on Pentecost, and reiterates the sanctifying grace with the Apostles received from the Paraclete.  Those who say the Sacrament should not be given are in error, because the "works of God are perfect" ([[Deuteronomy]] 32, 4).  The sanctifying grace of Confirmation tends to make strong and perfect the faith of the person.  [[Hugh of St. Victor]] (De Sacram. ii) "It would be altogether hazardous, if anyone happened to go forth from this life without being Confirmed."

==The Holy Eucharist==
{{see also|Eucharist (Catholic Church)}}

===''Summa Contra Gentiles''===
Condensed from [[Summa Contra Gentiles]], Book 4, Chapters 61 to 69: 

Life needs material nourishment to increase in quantity and to maintain the body. Spiritual effects are given under the likeness of things that are visible, hence are given the appearance of things men commonly use for bodily nourishment.  These are bread and wine.  He who begets is joined to the begotten in a way.  The nourished and the nourishment are joined.  It is the spiritual mystery that unites the Eucharist to us.  [[Gospel of John|John]] 6, 56: "My flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed."  John 6, 61:  "This saying is hard, and who can bear it?"  So it is with the heretics who put themselves at odds with the teaching of the Church.  [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 26, 26 "This is my body."  It should be noted that He did not say, "This is a sign or representation of my body."  Yet some heretics disclaim the truth of the presence of Christ in the Eucharist.  To some, it appears scandalous to eat the flesh and drink the blood of Christ.  [[Gospel of John|John]] 6, 64:  "The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life."  A thing begins to be where it was not before in two ways:  1.) by local motion; 2.) Conversion of something into itself.  Manifestly, the body of Christ ascended into  heaven, hence cannot be always on the altar.  It does not seem possible to some there is a new conversion of another into itself on the altar.  In a similar manner, a thing cannot be moved from one place to another without ceasing to be in the original place.  Therefore, it seems to some that Christ must cease to be in heaven when He is on the altar.  It seems impossible to some that the large body of a man could be contained in the host used in the Eucharist.  It is also hard to understand how the body of Christ can be present simultaneously, on many altars at once.  Another stumbling block is the appearance of the bread and wine.  The accidents of color, taste, figure, etc. remain.  [[Aristotle]] "The being of an accident is by inheritance."  Another problem occurs from the fact that the action and passion of the bread and wine are unchanged after the consecration.  Another problem occurs in the breaking of the bread, for it seems to some that the fragment of the bread cannot contain the whole body.  This would be as if a man lost an arm or leg, his whole being would be contained in the portion.  It is true that the teachings of the Church about the Eucharist are difficult.  Divine power operates in this sacrament with great secrecy and sublimity. It is beyond the ability of man to search it out.  The conversion occurs by a divine mode, and is not natural (in the way we understand it) in any way.  Air can be converted to fire.  This is called a formal conversion. But in the conversion of the Eucharist, a subject passes over into a subject without a change in the accidents.  This is called "substantial".  It was wise of Christ to assume the form of bread and wine, since it would be horrible for the believers to consume a real human body and blood.  Furthermore, it would be an abomination for those watching to observe such a thing.  There is a real conversion which takes place: "This is My Body...This is My Blood."  His body is contained in the bread by the force of conversion, while the blood is a natural accompaniment.  Under the appearance of wine, the converse is true.  The body of Christ is not related to place, with its own dimensions as a medium.  In the body of Christ, His own dimensions exist in one place only, but through the mediation of the dimensions of the bread passing into its places are as many as there are places in which this sort of conversion is celebrated.  It is not divided into parts, but is entire in every single one.  Every consecrated bread is converted into the entire Body of Christ.  The Body and Blood of Christ is not affected by the accidents of the bread and wine.  It is not impossible that divine power can affect the subject without changing the nature of the accidents.  In this sacrament He conserves the accident while changing the substance.  According to [[Aristotle]], the [[Platonists]] held that this was not possible.  But it is clear that God can do more in operation that the intellect of man can comprehend.  The Body and Blood are contained under the appearance.  [[Aristotle]]:  "Position is the order of parts of the whole... quantity is that which has position... with the quantity gone, all substance is indivisible."  Since we hold that in this sacrament the measurements subsist of themselves and that the other accidents are founded on these as on a subject, we need not say that accidents of this kind are not individuated;  for there persists in the measurements themselves the root of individuation.  In this sacrament, the accidents of the bread and wine persists.  Concerning passions (such as those which take place in the alterations of accidents of this kind), the difficulty is not hard to understand if the premises are granted.  The difficulty occurs regarding the generation and corruption which seems to take place in this sacrament.  If enough quantity of this sacrament were to be consumed, one could be nourished, and even made drunk.  [[I Corinthians]] 11, 21:  "One indeed is hungry and another is drunk."  It is amazing that some would claim that the bread and wine could not be converted into the body and blood of Christ, when we know that by putrefaction and combustion, this same bread is converted to dust and ashes.  However, the substance of a thing should not be confused with the accidents.  Combustion and putrefaction are not miracles, but the normal order of nature.  The conversion of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ is miraculous. The final difficulty is that whereby every portion of the bread contains the whole Christ. We should not seek the solutions in terms of mediating dimensions.  For every drop of water contains the nature and species of water.  The whole soul is in every part of the body.  Therefore, the breaking of the bread does not affect the dimensions of the whole body of Christ.  Ultimately, the Eucharist should be viewed from this standpoint:  nothing is impossible for God Who can do all things.  [[Gospel of John|John]] 6, 64:  "The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life."  We are to take this that there are certain spiritual foods given to us that are quite apart from earthly carnal foods.  One properly calls wine the liquid expressed from grapes.  We call bread that which is made from grain wheat.  If an admixture is introduced, the nature of the bread or wine can be lost.  It is not essential whether the bread be leavened or unleavened. [[St. Gregory]] "the Roman Church offers unleavened bread because our Lord took on flesh without any admixture.  But the rest of the Churches offer leavened bread, since the Word of God  was clothed with flesh, and is true God and true man, just as the leavened bread is mixed with paste."  Still, it is in greater harmony with the truth to use unleavened bread.  [[I Corinthians]] 5, 7-8:  "Christ our pasch is sacrificed.  Therefore, let us feast... with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."  There are certain Greek heretics who say that the sacrament cannot be offered with unleavened bread.  However, in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 26,17;  [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 14,12;  [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22,7, it is indicated that Christ performed the first Eucharist with unleavened bread.   Furthermore, it is clear that the use of unleavened bread is required by the Old Law ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 12,15).  The Greek arguments against the Latin Church for using unleavened bread are not based on scriptural interpretation.  Some use [[I Corinthians]] 11,23 and John 18,28 to indicate that leavened bread was used in the first pasch.  However, the Old Law was observed, and it is clear that unleavened bread would have been used at the Last Supper.  All the [[Gospels]]  ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]) indicate that the pasch was celebrated in accordance with the Old law.  It is clear that the Latin Church is reasonable in the use of unleavened bread.

===''Summa Theologiæ''===
The following is condensed from ''[[Summa Theologiæ]]'':

The Church's sacraments are ordained for helping man in the spiritual life.  But the spiritual life is analogous to the corporeal, since corporeal things bear a resemblance to spiritual.  There is only one sacrament in the Eucharist.  [[I Corinthians]] 10,17 "For we, being many, are one bread one body, all that partake of one bread."  It is clear that the Eucharist is the sacrament of the Church's unity.  This is to say that, just as Baptism is necessary for salvation, and can be obtained by desire, so can the Eucharist be obtained by desire.  Baptism is the beginning of spiritual life.  Baptism ordains a man for the reception of the Eucharist, which nourishes the spiritual life. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] explaining [[Gospel of John|John]] 6, 54:  "This food and this drink, namely, of His flesh and blood:  He would have us understand the fellowship of His body and members, which is the Church in His predestinated, and called, and justified, and glorified, His body and believing ones.  No one should entertain the slightest doubt, that then every one of this faithful becomes a partaker of the body and blood of Christ, when in Baptism he is made a member of Christ's body, nor is he deprived of his share in that body and chalice even though he depart from this world in the unity of Christ's body before he eats that bread and drinks that chalice."  [[John of Damascus|Damascene]] says that it is called [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|Communion]] because we communicate with Christ through it, both because we partake of His flesh and Godhead, and because we communicate with and are united to one another through it.  It is called the [[Eucharist]] because it is the "good grace" because it leads to the grace of God everlasting ([[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 4,23);  or because it really contains Christ, Who is full of grace.  The sacrament was instituted by Christ, of Whom it is said ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 7,37) that He did all things well.  [[Eusebius]] says "Since He was going to withdraw His assumed body from their eyes, and bear it away to the stars, it was needful that on the day of the supper He should consecrate the sacrament of His body and blood for our sakes, in order that what was once offered up for our ransom should be fittingly worshiped in a mystery."  Without faith in the Passion there could never be any salvation.  [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 3, 25:  "Whom God has proposed to be propitiation, through faith in His blood."  The chief sacrament of the Old Law was the Paschal Lamb.   [[I Corinthians]] 5, 7: "Christ our Pasch is sacrificed."  [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] ({{Not a typo|Respons}}. ad januar, i) "In order to commend more earnestly the depth of this mystery, our Savior willed this last act to be fixed in the hearts and memories of the disciples whom He was about to quit for the Passion."  And [[I Corinthians]] 5, 7-8:  "Christ our Pasch is sacrificed;  therefore let us feast.. with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."  Wheat is the appropriate matter for the bread of the host. [[Gospel of John|John]] 12,24:  "Unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it remains alone."  Therefore, Christ has compared Himself to the grain of wheat.  The presence of Christ's true body and blood in this sacrament cannot be detected by sense, nor understanding, but by faith alone, which rests upon the Divine authority.  [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22,19:  "This is My Body, which shall be delivered up for you."  [[Cyril]] says "Doubt not whether this is true;  but take rather the Savior's words with faith;  for since He is the Truth and He does not lie."

The consecration occurs when the priest states the words, "This is My Body;  this is My Blood."  But when the priest says this, it is Jesus Christ Who is saying it.  [[Ambrose]] (De Sacram. iv) "The consecration is accomplished by the words and expressions of the Lord Jesus.  Because, by all the other words spoken, praise is rendered to God, prayer is put up for the people, for kings and others;  but when the tome comes for perfecting the sacrament, the priest no longer uses his own words, but the words of Christ.  Therefore, it is Christ's words that perfect this sacrament."  Furthermore, for those who doubt the validity of these words, and who doubt that God could or would do this, [[Ambrose]] adds:  "If there be such might in the word of the Lord Jesus that things non-existent came into being, how much more efficacious is it to make things existing to continue, and to be changed into something new?  And so, what was the bread before the consecration is now the body of Christ after consecration, because Christ's word changes a creature into something different."  This is because Jesus Christ is the Word of God, which caused all creation to come into being.

==Penance, Confession (Reconciliation)==
{{see also|Confession (Catholic Church)}}
The following is condensed from [[Summa Contra Gentiles]], Book 4, Chapters 70-72:  

Although grace is bestowed upon men by the sacraments, they are not rendered incapable of sin.  He who receives the gratuitous gifts of grace, can still sin by acting against grace.  [[Aristotle]] "every evil man is ignorant."  [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 14,22: "They err that work evil."  [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 12,15:  "Looking diligently, lest any man be wanting to the grace of God;  lest any root of bitterness springing up to hinder."  [[Ephesians]] 4, 30:  "Grieve not the Holy  Spirit of God whereby you are sealed."   [[I Corinthians]] 9.27:  "I chastise my body and bring into subjection, lest perhaps when I preached to others, I myself should become a castaway."  This does away with the belief of some heretics that say that after a man has received the grace of the Spirit, is unable to sin, and that if he sins, he never had the grace of the Holy Spirit.  In this, they used to following to support their position: [[I Corinthians]] 13, *:  "Charity never falls away."  [[Gospel of John|John]]  3, 6-9: "Whoever abides in Him sins not, and whosoever sins has not seen Him nor known Him."  This is rebutted by the following:  [[Apocalypse]] 2, 4: "I have somewhat against you because you have your first charity."  [[I Corinthians]] 1, 8-10: "Shall be made void... when that which is perfect is come."  It is then that a perfect state of charity shall abide.  As long as a man lives with grace granted him, he will not sin.  If he turns from that grace, he will sin.  (Note:  This is an interesting doctrine of some fundamentalist churches that was taught in Aquinas' time, and it is taught today: "he that has been baptized in the Spirit cannot sin, and he who sins never had the Spirit."  Of course, the doctrine is considered false by the Catholic Church.  It completely ignores both our concupiscent nature (which is not abrogated with baptism) and free will, which is not necessarily changed, at least immediately, by the action of the sacrament.  AEF)   As long as we are alive, the will is mutable toward good or evil.  Good is more powerful than evil.  [[I Corinthians]] 6,9-11: "Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, shall possess the Kingdom of God.  And such of you were;  but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you were justified in the name of Jesus Christ and the Spirit of our God."  Grace and the sacrament increases nature's good.  If sin takes place after grace is received, we can still be led back to a state of justice.  Despair is an invitation to sinfulness.  [[Ephesians]] 4,19:  "Despairing have given themselves up to lasciviousness, unto the working of all uncleanness, unto covetousness."  Despair is a dangerous cesspool leading men to vices.  [[I John]] 2, 1-2:  "My little children, these things I write to you, that you may not sin.  But if any man sins, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the just.  And He is the propitiation for our sins."  [[II Corinthians]] 2, 6-7, 7-9: "[To the Corinthian fornicator] To him who is such a one, this rebuke is sufficient which is given by many: so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him... I am glad:  not because you were made sorrowful, but because you were made sorrowful unto penance."  [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 3,1: "You have prostituted yourself to many lovers;  nevertheless, return to Me, says the Lord."  [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 5, 21: "Convert us, O Lord, and we shall be converted;  renew our days, as from the beginning."  In this way one excludes the error of the [[Novatianism|Novatians]] who were wont to deny forgiveness to those who had sinned after Baptism.  They used the following to justify their error:  [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 6, 4-5: "It is impossible for those who were once illuminated, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit, have moreover tasted the good of God, and the powers of the world to come, and are fallen away: to be renewed again to penance."  However, these overlooked the passage which followed:  "Crucify again themselves the Son of God and of Him a mockery."  Therefore, to be renewed, one must be again crucified with the penance of Christ.  [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 6, 3:  "All we who were baptized in Christ Jesus are baptized in His death."  [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]] 3, 5: "According to His mercy, He has saved us, by the laver of regeneration and renovation of the Holy Spirit."  If a man sins after baptism, he cannot have baptism as a remedy.  Baptism, which is a spiritual regeneration cannot be given a second time.  When a person is healed by something given to him by a doctor, it is the healing power within him that heals him.  The spiritual health in the sacrament of penance is both internal and external.  Sins come from  disordering of the mind.  This is the first damage.  The second is that there is the guilt of punishment.  The third damage is the weakening of the general good, whereby a person is rendered more likely to sin again.  The first thing required is a proper ordering of the mind.  This cannot be achieved without the physician of the soul, Jesus Christ. [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 1, 21:  "[Jesus Christ] Who shall save his people from their sins."  [[I Peter]] 1, 3: "[Christ] regenerated us unto a lively hope."  It is turning the mind to God with a complete hatred of the sin that there is a remission of the sin and a wiping out of the fault.  However, there sometimes remains a fault.  The second part of the remission of sin in confession, is the actual confession itself.  This is the verbal communication of the sin to the minister of Christ.  [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 16, 19: "I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven."  Confession, like baptism, may be excluded by necessity, but no contempt in exigent circumstances [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].  [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 4, 10-12: "There is no other name given to men whereby we must be saved except by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ."  It is in this way that one avoids the error of [[Peter Lombard]] who said that confession was not necessary.  Satisfaction is the third part of penance.  It is evident that not every priest can absolve every man from every sin.  He can only do this when he has received the power to do so.  (Note: Peter Lombard was a prominent Scholastic in the Parisian scene in the late 12th century. AEF)

==Extreme Unction (Blessing of the Sick)==
{{main|Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)}}
The following is condensed from [[Summa Contra Gentiles]], Book 4, Chapter 73:  

The body is the instrument of the soul, and the instrument is for the use of the principal agent.  Hence, the body is disposed to be in harmony with the soul.  therefore, infirmity of the soul sometimes flows from the body, causing infirmity as well.  Also, bodily infirmity can sometimes hinder spiritual health.  Therefore, it was proper to employ a spiritual medicine against sin. [[Epistle of James|James]] 5, 14-15: "Is any man sick among you?  Let him bring in the priests of the Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.  And the prayer of the faith shall heal the sick man."  There is no guarantee that even is a man healed from his bodily infirmity, that he will necessarily be forgiven the infirmity of the soul.  Also, some who do not recover, physically, may enjoy great spiritual restoration from the sacrament. James adds: "And the Lord shall raise him up... if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven."  Now it frequently occurs that a man in a state of illness has no recollection of the sins he has committed, and never confessed, nor performed penance for remission.  It is impossible for one to lead a daily life without committing some form of sin.  This sacrament should serve to cleanse these sins.  This sacrament does not confer a consecration as occurs in Baptism or Confirmation.  Still, the sacrament should not be administered to one who is healthy, but rather reserved for the sick, since it has the external appearance of a medicine, or a medicinal rite.  The oils should be applied to the sources of the sins, namely the organs of the senses and the hands and the feet, by which the works of sin are carried out.  Some engage in anointing the loins, since these are a source of sin.  There is nothing incorrect in this practice.  Since no sin is forgiven, except by grace, it is clear that grace is conferred in this sacrament.  [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Dionysius]]: "It is proper for priests to confer this sacrament."  This is because the sacrament confers enlightening grace, and the order of priests tends to enlightenment. However, the sacrament does not require a bishop.  The effect of the sacrament can be blocked by a pretense in the receiver.  In this way, it is no different from any other sacrament.

==Holy Orders==
{{main|Holy orders (Catholic Church)}}
The following is condensed from [[Summa Contra Gentiles]], Book 4, Chapters 74-77.  According to [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Dionysius]], all the sacraments confer a spiritual grace.  This is a correct assessment.  The sacraments are conferred by visible men, who employ visual methods, to dispense invisible grace.  [[Hebrews]] 5, 1: "Every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in the things that appertain to God."  [[Ephesians]] 5, 25-26: "Christ loved the Church and delivered Himself up for it: that He might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life." [[I Corinthians]] 4, 1: "Let no man so account of us as ministers of Christ and  dispensers of the mysteries of God."  [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22, 19: "Do this in commemoration of Me."  [[Gospel of John|John]] 20, 23: "Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them."  The same instructions are given concerning teaching and baptizing.  [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 28, 19: "Going, therefore, teach all nations, baptizing them."  [[II Corinthians]] 13, 10: "The power which the Lord has given me unto edification and not into destruction."  [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] says this power is "for building up the Church."  [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 13, 27: "What I say to you, I say to all." [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 28, 20: "Behold, I am with you all days even to the consummation of the world."  The conferring of spiritual power is the province of the divine liberality.  This is the sacrament of Holy Orders.  The power of orders as a sacrament is established for the dispensation of the sacraments.  [[Aristotle]]:  "Everything is denominated from its end."  The power of orders must extend itself to the remission of sins by the dispensation of the sacraments which are ordered to the remission of sins:  baptism and penance (confession, reconciliation).  The powers of orders is also toward the Eucharist.  This is the meaning of the "keys to the Kingdom."  [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 15, 19: "I will give to you the keys to the Kingdom."  The lowest orders serves the priestly order.  These are doorkeepers who let the faithful in, and keep the unfaithful out.  Acolytes help prepare the sacred vessels.  Others prepare the people in the consummation of the sacrament. The three orders - the priesthood, the diaconate, and the subdiaconate are called sacred orders because they receive a ministry in something sacred.  There is a superior power within the Church which has a ministry of dispensing the sacrament of orders.  Church unity requires that all the faithful agree as to the faith.  In matters of faith, questions are bound to arise.  The unity of the Church demands that there is a single head of the Church.  This single head of the Church provides one voice to answer these questions.  [[Isaiah]] 5, 4: "What is there that I ought to do more to My vineyard that I have not done to it?"  It is a mistake to doubt that there is a single head of the Church.  [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 8, 15:  "Kings reign, and lawmakers decree just things." the best government is one ruled by one.  The Church is a militant Church.  [[Apocalypse]] 21, 2: "Jerusalem is coming down from heaven."  [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 25, 10; 26, 30:  "[Moses was told to make everything] according to the pattern I have shown you on the mountain." [[Apocalypse]] 21, 3: "They shall be His people and God Himself with them shall be their God."  In the militant Church, there must be one who presides over the things universally.  [[Book of Hosea|Osee]] 1, 11: "The children of [[Kingdom of Judah|Juda]] and the children of [[Israel]] shall be gathered together; and they shall appoint themselves a head."  [[Gospel of John|John]] 10, 16: "There shall be one fold and one shepherd." [[Gospel of John|John]] 21, 17:"Feed My sheep."  [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22, 32: "You being once converted confirm your brethren."  [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 16, 19: "I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven."  [[Isaiah]] 9, 7: "He shall sit upon the throne of [[David]] and upon His kingdom to establish and strengthen it with judgment and with justice from henceforth and forever."  [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 28, 20: "Behold I am with all days even to the consummation of the world."  By this is excluded all those who partake of the presumptuous error of saying that the [[Roman Pontiff]] is not the true successor of the rule of [[Saint Peter|Peter]].  It is in the nature of a consecration that it is persistent and lasts forever.  Nothing consecrated can be consecrated a second time.  A man is called good or bad in accord with the vice or virtue.  In this way, there is a habit of a sort.  Habit differs from power.  By power, we are able to do something.  By a habit we are not rendered able or unable to make something, but ready or unready in doing well or badly what we are able to do.  Habit neither gives ability nor removes it.  [[Gospel of John|John]] 1, 33: "He it is that baptizes."  The minister is an animate tool.  [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 7, 5: "Cursed be the man that trusts in man."   [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 23, 2-3: "The [[Scribes]] and [[Pharisees]] have sat on the chair of [[Moses]].  All things, therefore, whatsoever they do you, observe and do.  But according to their works, do you not."  This dispenses of the error of those who say that only good men can dispense sacraments, while evil ones cannot.

==Holy Matrimony==
{{see also|Marriage (Catholic Church)}}
The following is condensed from [[Summa Contra Gentiles]], Book 4, Chapter 78. So far as generation is ordered to a political good, it is subject to the ordering of [[law|civil law]]. Insofar as it is ordered to the good of the Church, it must be subject to the government of the Church. Matrimony consists of the union of a man and a woman purposing to generate and educate offspring for the worship of God.  It is a sacrament of the Church. 

Hence there is a certain blessing on those marrying that is given by the ministers of the Church. [[Ephesians]] 5, 32: "This is a great sacrament; but I speak in Christ and the Church." The union of a man and a woman mirrors the union of Christ and the Church. [[Canticles]] 6, 8: "one is My dove, My perfect one." [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 28, 20: "Behold I am with you all days even to the consummation of the world." [[I Thessalonians]] 4, 16: "We shall always be with the Lord." There are three goods [ends or aims] of matrimony as a sacrament of the Church:
#Offspring accepted and educated for the worship of God
#Fidelity by which one man is bound to one woman
#The sacrament by which there is an indivisibility of the union insofar as the sacrament is the union of Christ and the Church.

== History ==
===Origins===
The University of Agriculture, Faisalabad ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|جامعہ زرعيه فيصل آباد}}}}), (formally: ''Punjab Agricultural College and Research Institute''), is a [[university]] in the city of [[Faisalabad]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]]. It was established in 1906&lt;ref name=uaf&gt;http://uaf.edu.pk/faculties/agri/agri_history.html, History and Faculties of the University of Agriculture, [[Faisalabad]], Retrieved 15 Aug 2016&lt;/ref&gt; as the first major institution of higher agricultural education in the [[Punjab (British India)|undivided Punjab]].

At independence in 1947, Pakistan was a predominantly agricultural country. In spite of subsequent [[industrialization]] and development, [[agriculture]] remains central to its [[economy]]. After independence, the [[Government of Pakistan]] appointed the National Commissions on Food and Education to reform the existing [[agrarian system]] and to formulate measures for developing better agricultural potential. The commissions made a plea for the establishment of an agricultural university for research and education. It was established by upgrading the former Punjab Agricultural College and Research Institute in 1961. It was the first university built by the British Empire in 1906 with the foundation stone laying ceremony by Sir Louis Dane, the then Lieutenant and Governor of the Punjab.

The 1,950-acre campus represents both history and the present era. The new campus is lush green with a conglomeration of monolithic blocks built in modern style. The old campus is reminiscent of traditional Muslim architecture. The main campus is situated in the centre of the city (12&amp;nbsp;km northeast of the [[Faisalabad International Airport]]), about 2&amp;nbsp;km away from city centre/ clock tower.

UAF owns and operates major cultural assets such as the [[Zoology Museum]], [[UAF Art Gallery]], [[University Library]] 

The university's [[Faculty (division)|faculty]] employs more than 800 teachers.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The university has boys and girls hostels. It accommodates over 5,000 students and approximately 3,000 day scholars. Premier hostels are Jinnah Hostel (named after the founder of Pakistan [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]), [[Muhammad Iqbal|Iqbal]] Hall, [[Fatima Jinnah]] Hostel and [[Haley Hall]].

==Organisation and administration==
===Faculties and departments===
UAF is organised into faculties of Agriculture, Agricultural Engineering and Technology, Food Nutrition and Home Economics, Social sciences, Animal Husbandry, Food Sciences, Biotechnology, Biochemistry, Plant and Animal Breeding, Veterinary Science, Doctor of Pharmacy, Mathematics, Statistics and Sciences. A community college is on the main [[campus]] in [[Faisalabad]]. The College of Veterinary Sciences at [[Lahore]] was affiliated and is now a distinct entity known as the [[University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences|University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore]] (UVAS).

These units offer programmes leading to bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees in agriculture and allied fields. [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan|HEC]] ranks the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad as the best in the agriculture/veterinary field in Pakistan. The University of Agriculture [[Faisalabad]] ranked number 4 among the top 10 universities in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hec.gov.pk/english/universities/Documents/Ranking_Doc%20(2015).pdf, Ranking 2015- Overall Top 10 Higher Education Institutions, ranking table listings by the [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan]] (HEC), a [[Government of Pakistan]] governing body, Retrieved 15 Aug 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Faculty of Social Sciences====

The Faculty of Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology, established in 1963, with its constituent departments of Agricultural Economics, Farm Management, Agricultural Marketing, Cooperation and Credit and Rural Sociology, has now been functioning for over 51 years in the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad. It has endeavored to keep abreast with requirements in terms of academic programmes/activities over these years. However, looking at the likely shape of agricultural development, the direction and quality of research and the make-up of trained manpower output in the discipline of agricultural social sciences, the future trends need to be looked into seriously so as to be able to meet the challenges of the 21st century.

A perusal of the functioning of the constituent departments of the faculty showed that over the years the programmes of some of the departments had become less demanding in academic and research output in line with the present day requirements. Especially under WTO set up, where there has been a shift from subsistence agriculture to commercial agriculture putting further pressure to shift the emphasis to resource management strategy. Therefore, there was a strong need for a meaningful restructuring and fine tuning of the faculty to meet the challenges of the emerging requirements of the economy in the coming years.

Keeping in view this need of time, the Faculty was restructured in 2012. The name of faculty was changed to Faculty of Social Sciences. The departments of Agricultural Economics, Development Economics, and Environmental &amp; Resource Economics were merged into a new institute, Institute of Agricultural &amp; Resource Economics (IARE). Professor Dr. Muhammad Ashfaq is the first director of IARE, having served from June 2012.

Institute of Agricultural and Resource Economics now offers degree programs serving the needs of society:
* BSc (Hons) Agricultural &amp; Resource Economics (4 years)
* MSc (Hons) Agricultural Economics (2 years)
* MSc (Hons) Development Economics (2 years)
* MSc (Hons) Environmental &amp; Resource Economics (2 years)
* MSc Economics (Distance Learning Program) (2 years)
* M.Phil Economics (2 years)
* PhD Agricultural Economics
* PhD Environmental &amp; Resource Economics
* PhD Economics

The Faculty of Social Sciences is divided in following institutes:

* Institute of Agricultural and Resource Economics
* Institute of Business Management Sciences (offers programs at undergraduate and postgraduate level)
* Institute of Agricultural Extension and Rural Development (offers programs at undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral level)
* Department of Rural Sociology (offers programs at postgraduate level as well as PhD program)

Professor Dr Muhammad Iqbal Zafar is dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences.&lt;ref name=uaf/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12088">'''Wastewater quality indicators''' are [[laboratory]] test [[methodology|methodologies]] to assess suitability of [[wastewater]] for disposal or re-use.  Tests selected and desired test results vary with the intended use or discharge location.  Tests measure physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the waste water.
[[File:EMPLOYEE OF THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES APPROACHING TO TAKE WATER SAMPLES FROM THE... - NARA - 557241.jpg|thumb|right|Tests will determine the quality of this wastewater.]]

==Physical characteristics==

===Temperature===
Aquatic organisms cannot survive outside of specific temperature ranges.  [[Irrigation]] runoff and [[water cooling]] of [[power station]]s may elevate temperatures above the acceptable range for some species. Elevated temperature can also cause an [[algae bloom]] which reduces oxygen levels. (''See'' [[thermal pollution]].) '''[[Temperature]]''' may be measured with a calibrated [[thermometer]].&lt;ref name="Franson"&gt;Franson, Mary Ann ''Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater'' 14th edition (1975) APHA, AWWA &amp; WPCF {{ISBN|0-87553-078-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|125-126}}

===Solids===
Solid material in wastewater may be dissolved, suspended, or settled.  '''[[Total dissolved solids]]''' or TDS (sometimes called filterable residue) is measured as the mass of residue remaining when a measured volume of [[filter (chemistry)|filtered]] water is [[evaporate]]d.  The mass of dried solids remaining on the filter is called '''[[total suspended solids]]''' (TSS) or nonfiltrable residue.  '''[[Settling#Settleable solids analysis|Settleable solids]]''' are measured as the visible volume accumulated at the bottom of an Imhoff cone after water has settled for one hour.&lt;ref name="Franson"/&gt;{{rp|89-98}} '''[[Turbidity]]''' is a measure of the light scattering ability of suspended matter in the water.&lt;ref name="Franson"/&gt;{{rp|131-137}} '''[[Salinity]]''' measures water [[density]] or [[conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]] changes caused by dissolved materials.&lt;ref name="Franson"/&gt;{{rp|99-100}}

==Chemical characteristics==
Virtually any chemical may be found in water, but routine testing is commonly limited to a few [[chemical element]]s of unique significance.

===Hydrogen===
Water ionizes into [[hydronium]] (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O) [[cation]]s and [[hydroxyl]] (OH) [[anion]]s.  The concentration of ionized [[hydrogen]] (as protonated water) is expressed as '''[[pH]]'''.&lt;ref name="Franson"/&gt;{{rp|406-407}}

===Oxygen===
Most aquatic habitats are occupied by [[fish]] or other animals requiring certain minimum dissolved [[oxygen]] concentrations to survive.  '''[[Dissolved oxygen]]''' concentrations may be measured directly in wastewater, but the amount of oxygen potentially required by other chemicals in the wastewater is termed as oxygen demand.  Dissolved or suspended [[Redox|oxidizable]] organic material in wastewater will be used as a food source.  Finely divided material is readily available to microorganisms whose populations will increase to digest the amount of food available.  Digestion of this food requires oxygen, so the oxygen content of the water will ultimately be decreased by the amount required to digest the dissolved or suspended food.  Oxygen concentrations may fall below the minimum required by aquatic animals if the rate of oxygen utilization exceeds replacement by atmospheric oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Charles R. &amp; Horne, Alexander J. ''Limnology'' (1983) McGraw-Hill {{ISBN|0-07-023651-8}} p.111&lt;/ref&gt;

Basically, the reaction for biochemical oxidation may be written as:

:Oxidizable material + bacteria + nutrient + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + oxidized [[Inorganic chemistry|inorganics]] such as NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; or SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;

Oxygen consumption by reducing chemicals such as sulfides and nitrites is typified as follows:

:S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;

:NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + ½ O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

Since all natural waterways contain bacteria and nutrient, almost any waste compounds introduced into such waterways will initiate biochemical reactions (such as shown above).  Those biochemical reactions create what is measured in the laboratory as the '''[[biochemical oxygen demand]]''' (BOD).

Oxidizable chemicals (such as reducing chemicals) introduced into a natural water will similarly initiate chemical reactions (such as shown above).  Those chemical reactions create what is measured in the laboratory as the '''[[chemical oxygen demand]]''' (COD).

Both the BOD and COD tests are a measure of the relative oxygen-depletion effect of a waste contaminant.  Both have been widely adopted as a measure of pollution effect. The BOD test measures the oxygen demand of [[biodegradation|biodegradable]] pollutants whereas the COD test measures the oxygen demand of biodegradable pollutants plus the oxygen demand of non-biodegradable oxidizable pollutants.

The so-called 5-day BOD measures the amount of oxygen consumed by biochemical oxidation of waste contaminants in a 5-day period. The total amount of oxygen consumed when the biochemical reaction is allowed to proceed to completion is called the Ultimate BOD. Because the Ultimate BOD is so time consuming, the 5-day BOD has been almost universally adopted as a measure of relative pollution effect.

There are also many different COD tests of which the 4-hour COD is probably the most common.

There is no generalized correlation between the 5-day BOD and the ultimate BOD. Similarly there is no generalized correlation between BOD and COD. It is possible to develop such correlations for specific waste contaminants in a specific wastewater stream but such correlations cannot be generalized for use with any other waste contaminants or wastewater streams. This is because the composition of any wastewater stream is different. As an example an effluent consisting of a solution of simple [[sugar]]s that might discharge from a [[confectionery]] factory is likely to have organic components that degrade very quickly. In such a case, the 5 day BOD and the ultimate BOD would be very similar since there would be very little organic material left after 5 days. However a final effluent of a sewage treatment works serving a large industrialised area might have a discharge where the ultimate BOD was much greater than the 5 day BOD because much of the easily degraded material would have been removed in the sewage treatment process and many industrial processes discharge difficult to degrade organic molecules.

The laboratory test procedures for the determining the above oxygen demands are detailed in many standard texts. American versions include the "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater."&lt;ref&gt;Clescerl, Leonore S.(Editor), Greenberg, Arnold E.(Editor), Eaton, Andrew D. (Editor). ''Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater'' (20th ed.) American Public Health Association, Washington, DC. {{ISBN|0-87553-235-7}}. This publication is also available on CD-ROM and [http://www.standardmethods.org/ online] by subscription.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nitrogen===
[[Nitrogen]] is an important nutrient for plant and animal growth.  Atmospheric nitrogen is less biologically available than dissolved nitrogen in the form of [[ammonia]] and [[nitrate]]s.  Availability of dissolved nitrogen may contribute to [[algal bloom]]s.  Ammonia and organic forms of nitrogen are often measured as '''[[Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen]]''', and analysis for inorganic forms of nitrogen may be performed for more accurate estimates of total nitrogen content.&lt;ref name="Franson"/&gt;{{rp|406-407}}

===Phosphates===
;Total Phosphorus and Phosphate, PO{{su|b=4|p=−3}}
Phosphates enter the water ways through both non-point sources and point sources. Non-point source (NPS) pollution refers to water pollution from diffuse sources. Nonpoint source pollution can be contrasted with point source pollution, where discharges occur to a body of water at a single location. The non-point sources of phosphates include: natural decomposition of rocks and minerals, storm water runoff, agricultural runoff, erosion and sedimentation, atmospheric deposition, and direct input by animals/wildlife; whereas: point sources may include: waste water treatment plants and permitted industrial discharges. In general, the non-point source pollution typically is significantly higher than the point sources of pollution. Therefore, the key to sound management is to limit the input from both point and non-point sources of phosphate. High concentration of phosphate in water bodies is an indication of pollution and largely responsible for [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref&gt;MacCutheon et al., 1983{{Full citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phosphates are not toxic to people or animals unless they are present in very high levels. Digestive problems could occur from extremely high levels of phosphate.

The following criteria for total phosphorus were recommended by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]].
# No more than 0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/L for streams which do not empty into reservoirs,
# No more than 0.05&amp;nbsp;mg/L for streams discharging into reservoirs, and
# No more than 0.025&amp;nbsp;mg/L for reservoirs.&lt;ref&gt;US EPA (1984){{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phosphorus''' is normally low (&lt; 1&amp;nbsp;mg/l) in clean potable water sources and usually not regulated;&lt;ref&gt;Nduka et al., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (1984){{Full citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chlorine===
[[Chlorine]] has been widely used for [[bleach]]ing, as a [[disinfectant]], and for [[biofouling]] prevention in [[water cooling]] systems.  Remaining concentrations of oxidizing [[hypochlorous acid]] and [[hypochlorite]] ions may be measured as '''chlorine residual''' to estimate effectiveness of disinfection or to demonstrate safety for discharge to aquatic ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Franson"/&gt;{{rp|309-315}}

==Biological characteristics==
Water may be tested by a '''[[bioassay]]''' comparing survival of an aquatic test species in the wastewater in comparison to water from some other source.&lt;ref name="Franson"/&gt;{{rp|685-689}} Water may also be evaluated to determine the approximate biological population of the wastewater.  [[Pathogen]]ic micro-organisms using water as a means of moving from one host to another may be present in [[sewage]].  '''[[Coliform index]]''' measures the population of an organism commonly found in the intestines of warm-blooded animals as an indicator of the possible presence of other intestinal pathogens.&lt;ref name="Franson"/&gt;{{rp|875-877}}
