'''Arlene Blum''' (born March 1, 1945&lt;ref name="birth"&gt;Breaking Trail: A Climbing Life, page 344 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ra3565NlWLsC&amp;pg=PA344 Chapter 24 ]&lt;/ref&gt;) is an American [[mountaineering|mountaineer]], writer, and [[environmental health|environmental health scientist]]. She is best known for leading an all-woman ascent of [[Annapurna]] (I), a climb that was also the first successful American ascent. She was also a deputy leader of the first all-woman ascent of [[Mount Denali]] and the first American woman to attempt to ascend [[Mount Everest]]&lt;ref name="BA1"&gt;Blum, Arlene. Personal Interview. December 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and Executive Director of the [http://greensciencepolicy.org/ Green Science Policy Institute].

==Start in mountaineering==
Blum was born in [[Davenport, Iowa]], and raised from the age of five on in Chicago by her [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] mother and grandparents.&lt;ref name="birth" /&gt; In the early 1960s, she attended [[Reed College]] in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Her first climb was in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], where she failed to reach the summit of [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]]. However, she persevered, climbing throughout her college days. She was rejected from an Afghanistan expedition in 1969, with its leader writing to her, "One woman and nine men would seem to me to be unpleasant high on the open ice, not only in excretory situations but in the easy masculine companionship which is so vital a part of the joy of an expedition."&lt;ref name="jwa.org"/&gt; In 1970, she requested to join a high altitude expedition, but was told that she was welcome to come as far as the base camp to "help with the cooking."&lt;ref name="jwa.org"&gt;http://jwa.org/blog/climb-every-mountain&lt;/ref&gt; However, she was able to go climbing as part of her research for her senior thesis, which was on the topic of volcanic gases on [[Oregon]]'s [[Mount Hood]]. Blum graduated from Reed and attended [[MIT]] and [[UC Berkeley]], where she earned a PhD in [[Biophysics|biophysical chemistry]] in 1971. After graduate school, Blum embarked on what she called the "endless winter" – spending more than a year climbing peaks all over the world.

==Major climbs==
As deputy leader, Blum was part of the first all-woman team to ascend [[Alaska]]'s [[Mount Denali]] in 1970. She participated in a 1976 expedition up [[Mount Everest]] as part of the [[American Bicentennial]] Everest Expedition, but did not reach the summit. In 1978, she organized a team of eleven women to climb [[Annapurna]] (I) in [[Nepal]] which, until then, had been climbed by only eight people (all men). It was called American Women's Himalayan Expeditions – Annapurna. They raised money for the trip in part by selling T-shirts with the slogan "A woman's place is on top". The first summit team, comprising [[Vera Komarkova]] and [[Irene Miller]] and [[Sherpas]] [[Mingma Tsering]] and [[Chewang Ringjing]], reached the top at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on October 15, 1978. The second summit team, [[Alison Chadwick-Onyszkiewicz]] and [[Vera Watson]], died during this climb. After the event, Blum wrote a book about her experience on Annapurna, called ''Annapurna: A Woman's Place''.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Arlene, ''Annapurna: A Woman's Place'' (Sierra Club Books, San Francisco, 1980) {{ISBN|0-87156-236-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She led the first expedition to climb [[Bhrigupanth]] in the Indian [[Himalayas]], leading a team of Indian and American women. She then attempted what she called the "Great Himalayan Traverse", a two-thousand-mile journey across the treacherous but beautiful peaks of the Himalayas from [[Bhutan]] to India. She crossed the [[Alps]] from [[Yugoslavia]] to France, bearing her baby Annalise on her back in a backpack.

==Current science policy work==
As a researcher at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in the late 1970s, Blum's research contributed to the regulation of two cancer-causing chemicals used as flame retardants on children's sleepwear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml77/77030.html CPSC Bans TRIS-Treated Children's Garments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320211451/http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml77/77030.html |date=March 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blum taught at [[Stanford University]], [[Wellesley College]], and the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

After a long hiatus, Blum returned to science and policy work in 2006—when her daughter started college—and her memoir ''Breaking Trail: A Climbing Life'' ({{ISBN|0156031167}}) was published. She discovered that the same [[Tris(2,3-dibromopropyl) phosphate|Tris]] her research had helped remove from children's pajamas was back in California couches and baby products.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/18/business/18chemical.html?pagewanted=all Chemical Suspected in Cancer Is in Baby Products]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Blum co-founded the Green Science Policy Institute (GSP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://greensciencepolicy.org/ Green Science Policy Institute (GSP)]&lt;/ref&gt; with the goal of bringing scientific research results into policy decisions to protect human health and the environment from toxic chemicals. As executive director of the Green Science Policy Institute, Blum and her team have led several successful national and international campaigns against the use of toxic chemicals, particularly halogenated [[flame retardants]].

Blum has published articles about science policy in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', and ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'' magazine.

===Current GSP projects===
* Helping create safer standards for consumer products, including bedding materials, furniture, and baby products.
* Reducing the use of toxic chemicals in buildings by informing architects and builders of alternative materials, building codes, and the adverse health effects associated with exposure to [[flame retardants]].
* Working with Chinese scientists, industry leaders, academics, and government to create greater awareness of the growing chemical-flame-retardant industry in China.
* Conducting research on exposure to toxic chemicals and health of fire fighters, flight attendants, and U.S. and Chinese workers.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Arlene. [http://greensciencepolicy.org/our-mission-and-goals "Our Mission and Goals."] Green Science Policy Institute. December 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing and awards==
Her first book, ''[[Special: BookSources/1578050227|Annapurna: A Woman's Place]]'' was included in [[Fortune Magazine]]'s 2005 list of "The 75 Smartest Business Books We Know" and chosen by ''[[National Geographic Adventure Magazine]]'' as one of the 100 top adventure books of all time. Her award-winning memoir, ''[[Special: BookSources/0156031167|Breaking Trail: A Climbing Life]]'' tells the story of how Blum realized improbable dreams among the world's highest mountains, in the chemistry laboratory, and in public policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blum|first1=Arlene; foreword by Maurice Herzog|title=Annapurna, a woman's place|date=1998|publisher=Sierra Club Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=1-57805-022-7|edition=20th anniversary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blum's books can also be viewed as works that contribute to showing the hardships faced by women geographers in a male dominated field (at that time).

Blum's awards include a Purpose Prize&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.purposeprize.org/video/yt_video.cfm?candidateID=3527 Purpose Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; to those over 60 who are solving society's greatest problems, National Women's History Project selection as one of "100 Women Taking the Lead to Save Our Planet"&lt;ref name="WHM"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2010 | title=Honorees: 2010 National Women's History Month | work=Women's History Month | publisher=[[National Women's History Project]] | url=http://nwhp.org/whm/honorees.php | accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Gold Medal from the Society of Women Geographers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iswg.org/ Society of Women Geographers]&lt;/ref&gt; an honor previously given to only eight other women including Amelia Earhart, Margaret Mead, and Mary Leakey. ''Breaking Trail'' received an Honorable Mention from the [[National Outdoor Book Award]] in 2005.

Arlene Blum is the founder of the annual Berkeley Himalayan Fair and the Burma Village Assistance Project. She serves on the boards of the Society for the Preservation of Afghan Archeology; ISET, an organization dedicated to solving climate, water and disaster problems in South Asia; and the advisory boards for Project REED
which builds libraries in Asia, Environmental Building News, and the [[Plastic Pollution Coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Arlene. [http://www.arleneblum.com/about.html "About Arlene Blum."] Arlene Blum. December 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Blum was the winner of the Sierra Club's [[Francis P. Farquhar Mountaineering Award]] for 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sierraclub.org/awards/downloads/award_sr.pdf Sierra Club Awards] – List by Award&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 7, 2012, the [[American Alpine Club]] inducted Blum into its Hall of Mountaineering Excellence at an award ceremony in [[Golden, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

*"The health and environmental problem from such chemicals could be as threatening as climate change, but I believe it is a problem that can be solved relatively easily. It's a matter of informing the public – and political will."&lt;br&gt;—Purpose Prize profile&lt;ref name="WF1"/&gt;
*"My new adventure in science and policy work is the most challenging and important of my life and I feel lucky to look out at the horizon and see endless rows of mountains to climb."&lt;br&gt;—Reed 100th Anniversary Festschrift Volume&lt;ref name="BA1"/&gt;
*"In America, foods, drugs and pesticides are regulated, you may say they are not well enough regulated, but you really have to provide information because those are the things that go into our mouths. Other chemicals like flame retardants are not regulated, there are not really health requirements but they go into our bodies the same way." -Arlene Blum, as interviewed in [[Stink!]] Movie

==Personal life==

Blum lives and works in [[Berkeley, California]]. She has a daughter, Annalise Blum, a 2010 graduate of [[Stanford University]] in environmental engineering.

A '''beam spoiler''' is a piece of material, placed into the path of the [[photon]] beam in [[radiotherapy]]. The purpose of the spoiler is to reduce the depth of the maximum radiation dosage.&lt;ref name=bentel&gt;Bentel, G.C. (1996) ''Radiation therapy planning'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=bk0go_-FO5QC&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=beam%20spoiler&amp;pg=PA103#v=onepage&amp;q=beam%20spoiler&amp;f=false p.103.] McGraw-Hill Professional {{ISBN|0-07-005115-1}} Retrieved September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
The beam spoiler is composed of a sheet of material which has a low [[atomic number]],&lt;ref&gt;Specht, L., Yahalom, J. (2010) ''Radiotherapy for Hodgkin Lymphoma'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=NJqVQVVd7dQC&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=beam%20spoiler&amp;pg=PA125#v=onepage&amp;q=beam%20spoiler&amp;f=false p.125.] Springer. {{ISBN|3-540-78455-1}} Retrieved September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; typically [[lucite]], the thickness of which is varied according to the beam energy and the distance by which the radiation dose must be shifted.&lt;ref name=bentel/&gt;

==Action==
As the primary photon beam passes through the plate, secondary [[electron]]s are generated. The beam exiting the spoiler is a combination of the spoiler-attenuated photons and the spoiler-generated electrons. The electron component alters the depth dose in the buildup region in a way that depends on the photon beam energy, the field size, and the distance of the spoiler from the treatment surface.

The '''Bezalel school''' was an [[art movement]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the late Ottoman and [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] periods.  Named for the Bezalel Art School, predecessor of the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]], it has been described as "a fusion of [[Asian art|oriental art]] and [[Jugendstil]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artatthecenter.com/HTML/Artists.cfm?ID=35 AATC Artists - Ze'ev Raban]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bezalel school artists blended varied strands of surroundings, tradition and innovationin paintings and craft objects that  invoked biblical themes, Islamic design and European traditions in their effort to carve out a distinctive style of Jewish art for the new nation planned in the ancient Jewish homeland.&lt;ref&gt;MUSEUM REVIEW | DERFNER JUDAICA MUSEUM, Jewish Art, the Hudson and Bingo in the Bronx, [[Edward Rothstein]], ''The New York Times'', June 10, 2009, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/11/arts/design/11muse.html?_r=1&amp;ref=arts]&lt;/ref&gt;
The works of art created by the group contributed significantly to the creation of a distinctive [[Culture of Israel|Israeli national culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Nationalism, Zionism and ethnic mobilization of the Jews in 1900 and beyond, Michael Berkowitz, BRILL, 2004  p.93ff&lt;/ref&gt;

The founder of the school was [[Boris Schatz]], who left his position as  head of the Royal Academy of Arts in Sofia, Bulgaria, to make aliyah 1906 and established an academy for Jewish arts in [[Jerusalem]].  The artists were Zionist immigrants from Europe and the Middle East, with all the psychological and social upheaval that this implies.&lt;ref&gt;Bezalel School turns 100 years old, by Shulamit Reinharz, Jewish Advocate, Tuesday March 4, 2008, {{cite web |url=http://www.thejewishadvocate.com/this_weeks_issue/columnists/reinharz/?content_id%3D2076 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207235245/http://www.thejewishadvocate.com/this_weeks_issue/columnists/reinharz/?content_id=2076 |archivedate=2007-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement developed a distinctive style combining Biblical and Zionist subjects with [[art nouveau]], [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]]  and traditional Persian and Syrian artistry.&lt;ref&gt;SOTHEBY'S BEZALEL AND ISRAELIANA CATALOG, TEL-AVIV, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bezalel School produced decorative art objects in a wide range of materials: silver, leather, wood, brass and fabric. While the artists and designers were European-trained, the craftsmen who executed the works were often members of the [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite Jewish community]], which had a long tradition of craftsmanship in precious metals, and began to make aliyah about 1880. In Yemen, filigree jewelry making was a respected profession among the Jews, with cultural as well as religious applications. [[Yemenite Jewish silversmiths]] worked primarily with silver, creating pieces by hand using traditional methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyndiesstudiodesigns.com/filigreehistory.html A History of Filigree]&lt;/ref&gt; Yemenite immigrants wearing colorful traditional costumes were also frequent subjects of Bezalel School artists.

Leading members of the school were Boris Schatz, [[Ephraim Moses Lilien|E. M. Lilien]], [[Ya'akov Stark]], [[Meir Gur-Aryeh]], [[Ze'ev Raban]], [[Jacob Eisenberg]], [[Jacob Steinhardt]], [[Shmuel Ben David]], and [[Hermann Struck]].

The artists produced not only paintings and etchings, but objects sold as Judaica and souvenirs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.absolutearts.com/artsnews/2000/08/25/27362.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, ''[[The New York Times]]''  praised the “Exquisite examples of filigree work, copper inlay, carving in ivory and in wood,” in a touring exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;REVIVE JEWISH ARTISTRY.; Bezalel School of Jerusalem Shows Distinctive Works of Art, ''The New York Times'', Nov. 14, 1915  query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30D15FF3A5812738DDDAD0994D9415B858DF1D3&lt;/ref&gt;

In the metalwork Moorish patterns predominated, and the damascene work, in particular, showed both artistic feeling and skill in execution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F04E3DF1E39E633A2575AC0A9679C946596D6CF, Work of Bezalel School of Handicrafts, ''The New York Times'', Jan. 9, 1914]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16948">'''Business education''' involves teaching students the fundamentals, theories, and processes of [[business]]. Education in this field occurs at several levels, including [[secondary education]] and [[higher education]] or [[university]] education.  Approximately 38% of students enroll in one or more business courses during their high school tenure.

==Secondary education==
{{Main|Business studies}}

Business is taught as an academic subject at [[secondary education|secondary]] level in many countries, including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], [[Ireland]], [[Lesotho]], [[Nepal]], [[New Zealand]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nigeria]], [[South Africa]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Argentina]], [[Sweden]], [[Tanzania]], [[Malaysia]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. At pre-tertiary level, it is often called '''Business Studies''', and usually combines elements of [[accountancy]], [[finance]], [[marketing]], [[organizational studies]], [[human resource management]] and [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sh.se/p3/ext/content.nsf/aget?openagent&amp;key=about_the_subject_1298025420871|title=Business studies|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Undergraduate education==
At the [[university]] level, students have the opportunity to take [[undergraduate degree]]s, usually a [[bachelor's degree]], in business and management. Specific curricula and degree-granting procedures differ by program and by region.  In general though, the program will comprise either preparation for management and general business, or a detailed - more academic - focus on a specific area. Regardless, all will typically include basic selections such as Accounting, Marketing, Finance, and [[Operations Management]].

Management-directed programs&lt;ref&gt;See for example BBA program outlines at: [https://www.uregina.ca/admin/academic/business_school/majors.htm uregina.ca]; [http://iitrade.ac.in/courses.asp?detail=bba Institute of International Trade]&lt;/ref&gt; are designed to give a broad knowledge of the functional areas of a company, and their interconnection, and also to develop the student's practical managerial skills, communication skills and business decision-making capability. These programs thus incorporate [[training]] and practical experience, in the form of [[case study|case projects]], presentations, [[internship]]s, industrial visits, and interaction with experts from the industry.

Subject specific programs, on the other hand, focus on a particular area, and are often more weighted towards theory. Even in these cases, however, additional to their [[academic major|major]], students are exposed to general business principles, taking initial courses in accounting/finance, human resources, statistics, marketing, economics, and information systems.

Degrees offered here include:
* The [[Bachelor of Business Administration]] (BBA) degree is awarded to students who complete three to four years of full-time study in [[business administration]]. The degree often, though not always, requires a major in a specific field such as [[accountancy|accounting]], finance, [[human resource management|HRM/personnel]], marketing, [[management]], [[management information systems]], [[real estate]], [[strategic management]], or others. Similar programs include the [[Bachelor of Science in Business Administration]] (BSBA), a quantitative variant on the BBA, [[Bachelor of Science in Business]] and [[Bachelor of Administrative Studies]] degrees. The [[Bachelor of Public Administration]] (BPA) is an [[undergraduate degree]] in [[public administration]]. The [[Bachelor of Business Management]]/[[Bachelor of Management Studies]] are similar to the BBA, but with a stronger emphasis on leadership and management skills.
* The Bachelor of International Business economics (BIBE) degree is awarded to students who complete four years of full-time study in business administration. In the last 2 years students must choose a specific field (such as the ones mentioned in the BBA). This degree is taught only in English and its aim is to enable students to work abroad and be prepared to manage large, multinational firms. It is compulsory to study abroad for at least 6 months. This degree appeared with the Bologna Process in Europe and is taught in universities like the [[Pompeu Fabra University]].
* The [[Bachelor of Commerce]] (B.Com, or B.Comm; [[Bachelor of Commerce and Administration]] (BCA) is an alternate title) is, likewise, an undergraduate degree in general [[business management]], although it is more theory-based and usually incorporates an [[Bachelor of Commerce#Areas of study|academic major]]. The distinction between the B.Comm and the BBA, then, is often that the latter specifically applies theories to real-life business situations, while the former concentrates more broadly on a wide range of ideas and concepts in [[commerce]] and related subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBA and BCom: What's the difference? |url=http://www.news.utoronto.ca/bba-amd-bcom-whats-difference |publisher=University of Toronto – News@UofT |website=News.utoronto.ca |date=10 June 2008 |accessdate=8 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628141733/http://www.news.utoronto.ca/social-sciences-business-law/bba-amd-bcom-whats-the-difference.html |archivedate=28 June 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Bachelor of Business]] (B.Bus or B.Bus (Major)) degree is an undergraduate degree in general business management offered by universities in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand. Similar in nature to the Bachelor of Commerce degree, Bachelor of Business degrees are often awarded at technology-focused universities in accordance with the Dawkins review (1986) of the Australian higher education sector. At many Australian universities, a Bachelor of Business degree enables graduates to undertake greater specialty in their chosen academic major as compared to a general BBA degree.
* The [[Bachelor of Management and Organizational Studies]] degree (BMOS in Canada) is a four-year undergraduate degree in business management. However, this degree teaches knowledge-based business and is as much theoretical as it is case-based. The BMOS degree especially emphasizes social sciences such as psychology, sociology, economics, etc.
* The [[Bachelor of Business Science]] (B.Bus.Sc) degree is similar to the BCom. However, it is a four-year honors-level course with an increased focus on the major and covers [[list of management topics|management theory]] in further depth. Also, students taking this approach are able to major in various quantitative disciplines not (typically) available in the B.Comm or BBA; related to this—and similarly in distinction—''all'' B.Bus.Sc students require a full first-year [[mathematics]] course, and in addition to this, courses in statistics.
* The [[Bachelor of Accountancy]] (B.Acy or B.Acc or B. Accty) degree is a specialized degree in accountancy; it is often the principal (or only) undergraduate degree [[First professional degree#Professional degrees|recognized for later professional practice]]. It is distinct from a BBA or B.Comm with a major in accountancy in that the entire program is focused on accountancy, while other topics are supplementary. It is also known as Bachelor of Accounting, Bachelor of Accounting Science, or Bachelor of Comptrolling (B.Acc.Sci or B.Compt).
* The [[Bachelor of Economics]] (B.Ec, B.Econ.Sc; sometimes BA (Econ), B.Sc (Econ), B.S.Sc (Econ) or BBA (Econ)) degree is similarly a specialized degree in the field of economics. Courses may last anywhere from three years to six years and are typically more [[theoretical]] and [[mathematical]] than the BBA or B.Comm with a major in economics (often substantially so). Economics is not a business discipline ''per se'' but a social science, and economics degrees are therefore often offered through liberal arts colleges.
* There are various other specialized business degrees such as the [[Bachelor of Finance and Banking]]. A further example is the [[Bachelor of Arts in Organizational Management]] (BAOM) degree, which is awarded to students who complete a four-year course of study in the field. The core functions of this program are the teaching of organizational functions, communication, group behavior, decision-making, human resources management, ethics, and to develop and deploy in the students effective skills in management and leadership. Also offered are the [[Bachelor of Science in Business Education]] (BSBE), an undergraduate degree in [[the teaching of business]] and the [[Bachelor of Business Teacher Education]] (BBTE), a variant on the BSBE.

==Postgraduate education==
At the [[graduate school]] level, students seek a variety of [[master's degrees]], either in [[general management]]–very commonly the [[MBA]]–or in a specific area, such as marketing or finance.  A further distinction is that students pursuing postgraduate degrees often have some business experience, although this is not always a program requirement. 

Corresponding to both of these, graduate degrees in business and management are generally of two sorts. 
* On the one hand, programs such as the Master of Science (M.Sc) or Arts (MA) or Commerce (M.Com) in General Management (sometimes also called Master in Management, or MIM) usually do not require professional experience. (Often the M.Sc in Management is for graduates with a first academic degree in a social science, while the MA in Management is for other backgrounds. The Master of Engineering Management, MEM, is aimed at graduates with an engineering background.) 
* On the other hand, the [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) requires a minimum of two to three years of professional experience and is open for graduates from any field. 

A related distinction: the M.Sc in Management is more specialized than an MBA, and is more suited for academic research, while the MBA is more industry- and management-focused. 

As regards degree structure, postgraduate business programs are, in general, designed such that students gain exposure to theory and practice alike;&lt;ref&gt;See for example: [http://www.hbs.edu/mba/academic-experience/Pages/the-hbs-case-method.aspx "The HBS case-method", hbs.edu]; [http://www.chicagobooth.edu/about/chicago-approach "The Chicago Approach", chicagobooth.edu]; [http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/programmes/mba/learning/practical-learning/ "Practical Learning", jbs.cam.ac.uk]; [http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/mba/academic-experience "Academic Experience", gsb.stanford.edu].&lt;/ref&gt; the mix, though, will differ by degree and by school,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronaldyeaple/2012/07/09/is-the-mba-case-method-passe/ Is the MBA Case Method Passé?] [[forbes.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; as discussed. Learning is then through lectures, case studies, and often team projects (“syndicate” work). The theory is covered in the classroom setting by [[Professor|academic faculty]]. Particularly in the MBA, the theory is then reinforced, and revisited, also in the classroom setting, through the [[case method]], placing the student in the role of the decision maker, "complete with the constraints and incomplete information found in real business issues." Practical learning often comprises [[Management consulting|consulting project]]s with real clients, or at least addressing an actual case, and is often undertaken in teams. The practical elements (as well as the case studies) may involve [[Professor#Non-tenure-track positions 2|external practitioners]], and sometimes executives, supporting the teaching from academic faculty.  (See [[Business school #Use of case studies]] and [[Business_school#Other_approaches|#Other approaches]].) One of the challenges for business academics is demonstrating that their curriculum is relevant to those who want to become managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacIntosh|first=Robert|last2=Beech|first2=Nic|last3=Bartunek|first3=Jean|last4=Mason|first4=Katy|last5=Cooke|first5=Bill|last6=Denyer|first6=David|date=2017-01-01|title=Impact and Management Research: Exploring Relationships between Temporality, Dialogue, Reflexivity and Praxis|journal=British Journal of Management|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=3–13|doi=10.1111/1467-8551.12207|issn=1467-8551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctoral==
At the [[doctoral]] level, all degrees offered are research focused, although they do differ as regards their relative weightings of theory versus practice. Typically, the DBA, DPA, DHA and D.Mgt emphasize [[Management#Levels of management|managerial practice]] alongside research; relatedly, the theses for these degrees will often focus on [[applied research]]. The other doctorates here are (exclusively) theory and research based. Entrance is usually on the basis of a relevant master's degree, and for practice-weighted degrees, relevant managerial experience. For the topic areas applicable to the [[thesis]] component see: [[List of fields of doctoral studies in the United States#Business Management.2FAdministrative Services|List of fields of doctoral studies in the United States

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9577">''For the legal system of  ecclesiastical canons, see [[Canon law]] and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)]].''
{{canon law}}
In [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]], a '''canon''' is a certain rule or norm of conduct or belief prescribed by the [[Catholic Church]]. The word "canon" comes from the Greek ''kanon'', which in its original usage denoted a straight rod that was later the instrument used by architects and artificers as a measuring stick for making straight lines.&lt;ref name=Berman199&gt;Berman, ''Law and Revolution'', pg. 199&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kanon'' eventually came to mean a rule or norm, so that when the first ecumenical council—[[Nicaea I]]—was held in 325, ''kanon'' started to obtain the restricted juridical denotation of a law [[promulgation (canon law)|promulgated]] by a [[synod]] or [[ecumenical council]], as well as that of an individual bishop.&lt;ref name=Berman199/&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Wiktionary|canon law}}
[[Greek language|Greek]] ''kanon'' / {{lang-grc|κανών}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Canon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arabic language|Arabic]] Qanun / قانون, [[Hebrew]] kaneh / קנה, "straight"; a rule, code, standard, or measure; the root meaning in all these languages is "reed" (''cf.'' the Romance-language ancestors of the English word "cane"). A ''kanon'' was the instrument used by architects and artificers for making straight lines.

==Pre-Nicene usage==
{{main article|Legal history of the Catholic Church}}
Some writers think that the Church preferred the word ''canon'' to ''[[law]]'', as the latter had a harsh meaning for the faithful in the times of persecution.

The early Fathers use canon as equivalent to the rule of faith, or for some formula expressing a binding obligation on Christians.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Irenæus, Adv. Hær., I, ix; Tertullian, De Præscr., 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bickell declares that for the first three hundred years, canon is scarcely ever found for a separate and special decree of the Church; rather does it designate the rule of faith in general. He appeals to the fact that the plural form of the word is seldom used in the earliest Christian writers.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Bickell, Geschichte des Kirchenrechts, I, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nicene and Medieval usage==
With the fourth century began the use of canon for a disciplinary decree, owing to its employment in this sense by the [[First Council of Nicea]] (325 A.D.).

The Cassinese editors of Ferraris (s. v. Canones) say that in the first ages of the Church many disciplinary regulations were not required, and hence it was scarcely necessary to discriminate decrees into dogmatic and disciplinary, as the faithful classed both under the obligation to observe the general rule of faith.

===''Canon'' vs. ''decretum''===
{{see also|Decree (canon law)|Decretal|Decretum Gratiani}}
From the fourth century onward, ''canon'' signified almost universally a disciplinary decree of a council or of the [[Roman Pontiff]]s.

The word ''decretum'' during the same period, though signifying in general an authoritative statute or decision, began to be limited more and more to dogmatic matters, while canon when used in opposition to it was restricted to laws of discipline. That this usage, however, was not invariable is evident from [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]]'s use of "[[Decretum Gratiani|Decretum]]" to signify his collection of canons and decrees.&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]] himself entitled his work ''Concordantia discordantium canonum'' or "Concordance of Discordant Canons". Early [[Decretists]] gave to Gratian's [[codification (law)|codification]] the title of ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tridentine usage==
From the [[First Council of Nicea]] up to the beginning of the [[Council of Trent]], the regulations concerning discipline issued by assemblies of bishops received the name of canons.

With the [[Council of Trent]] in the sixteenth century began the departure from this ancient usage. This council used the word ''canon'' for short, dogmatic definitions with an anathema attached to them. On the other hand, it gave the name of ''decrees'' to its disciplinary regulations. The example set by Trent was followed by the [[First Council of the Vatican]].

The usage of Trent seems to bring ''canon'' nearer to the signification it bore before the [[First Council of Nicea]], when it referred rather to faith than to discipline. The general idea of a decision by Church authority seems to be also the root-meaning of the expressions "[[Canon of Scripture]]", "[[Canon of the Mass]]", "[[Canonization#Catholic Church|Canon of Saints]]", although for the last term Ducange (s. v. Canonizare) suggests a somewhat different origin.

==Codifications==
As ecclesiastical regulations began to multiply, it became necessary to gather them into codices, which generally received the title of "[[Collections of ancient canons|Collection of Canons]]". In these, civil laws are often added to the Church regulations. For such collections the Greeks used the term ''[[Nomocanon]]es''. The Latins have no special name for them, though Capitularies (q. v.), e. g. of Charlemagne, is sometimes referred to as a somewhat parallel usage in the West.

==Authority==
As to the authority of ecclesiastical canons, it is evident a distinction must be made when speaking of canons of faith and canons of discipline, for the former are irreversible, the latter are not. Similarly, it is plain that canons containing a precept already binding by reason of [[Divine law|Divine]] or [[natural law]], cannot be on the same footing as those that are of mere ecclesiastical origin.

In general, the ''[[Corpus Juris Canonici]]'' declares&lt;ref group=note&gt;Cf. cap. 1. de Const.&lt;/ref&gt; that canonical statutes are binding on all; likewise&lt;ref group=note&gt;''Corpus Juris Canonici'', cap. Quum scimus&lt;/ref&gt; that bishops are the guardians of the canons and must see to their observance. When there is question of canons in the ordinary ecclesiastical sense (namely, that which obtained before the [[Council of Trent]]), as they refer principally to matters of discipline, it must be borne in mind that they are neither immutable nor irreformable.

The subject-matter of such canons depends not only on circumstances of persons, places, and times, but also on considerations of expediency or temporary necessity. A change in any of the causes which brought about the framing of the canons, will make a change in their binding-force, for disciplinary regulations are almost necessarily mutable.

In like manner when there is question of the binding force of a canon, it is important to determine whether it was issued by a [[ecumenical council|general council]] or by the decree of a [[pope]], as imposing an obligation on all the faithful, or whether it was framed solely for restricted regions or persons. In the latter case its binding-force is as restricted as its scope.

==Abrogation, Obrogation, and Custom==

It must be borne in mind that the object which the Church has always had in view in [[promulgation (canon law)|promulgating]] her canons has been the guidance and preservation of the clergy and laity in the duties of a Christian life and in the best methods of ecclesiastical administration.

Although, therefore, such canons contain elements of positive human law, yet ultimately they are founded on the [[divine law|Divine]] or [[natural law]]. As such, they cannot be entirely abrogated by contrary custom (Ferraris, loc. cit.), though their rigour may be mitigated by certain circumstances, on the ceasing of which, the pristine rigour of the canon would be again binding.

When they are entirely of human law, they may, of course, be completely abrogated, not only by legislation on the part of the proper authorities, but also by legitimate custom.

William H. W. Fanning, in his 1913 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' article on ''Ecclesiastical canons'', suggests that
{{quote|The neglect of the prescriptions of the sacred canons has always been the source of corruption in morals, and perhaps the chief reason for the loss of faith by nations as well as by individuals.&lt;ref&gt;WikiSource, "Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)", [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Ecclesiastical_Canons ''Ecclesiastical Canons''], accessed 30 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
According to Fanning, the study of the sacred canons is especially enjoined on the clergy. Fanning speculates that perhaps most of the regulations refer directly to ecclesiastics, and suggests that clergy will find in them the surest guidance for their own conduct and for the fruitful exercise of their ministry in directing the faithful.

[[File:Vincenzo Camuccini - La morte di Cesare.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Death of Caesar, the well-known climax of [[Shakespeare]]'s play, ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'']]

The '''climax''' (from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word ''κλῖμαξ'', meaning "staircase" and "ladder") or '''turning point''' of a [[narrative|narrative work]] is its point of highest tension and drama, or it is the time when the action starts during which the solution is given.&lt;ref Name="Herrick"&gt;{{cite book  |author1=Robert Herrick |author2=Lindsay Todd Damon  | title = Composition and Rhetoric for Schools  | publisher = Scott, Foresman and Co.  | year=  1902  | location = Original from Harvard University  | pages = 382  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XwABAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA382&amp;dq=Climax+(narrative)+-wikipedia&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1   | doi =    }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite book  |author1=Jefferson Butler Fletcher |author2=George Rice Carpenter  | title = Introduction to Theme-writing  | publisher = Allyn &amp; Bacon  | year=  1893  | location = Original from Harvard University  | pages = 84  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dP0AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Climax+(narrative)+-wikipedia&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1  | doi =    }}&lt;/ref&gt; The climax of a story is a [[literary element]].

== Examples ==
The [[punch line]] of a [[joke]] is an analogy for the climax of a fictional narrative, though the absence of any [[falling action]] is an essential difference, which may reflect the nature of [[humor]] as opposed to the nature of [[drama]].

In non-fictional narrative [[genre]]s, even though the author does not have the same freedom to control the action and "plot" as in works of fiction, the selection of subject matter, degree of detail, and emphasis permit an author to create similar structures, i.e., to construct a dramatization.

In the play ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'', by the famous Greek playwright, [[Euripides]], the climax arrives when Phaedra hears Hippolytus react badly because of her love for him. That is the moment that [[Aphrodite]]'s curse is finally fulfilled, and it is the turning point of the play.

== {{anchor|Anti-climax}} Anticlimax ==
An anticlimax is a situation in a plot in which something which would appear to be difficult to solve is solved through something trivial. For example, destroying a heavily guarded facility would require advanced technology, teamwork, and weaponry for a climax, but for an anticlimax, it may just require pushing a red button which reads, "Emergency Self-Destruct", or simply filling out an eviction notice and destroying the building. A famous example is the ending of ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', where amidst the chaos of the extraterrestrial takeover of planet [[Earth]], the aliens are defeated by the most unexpected organism: the common cold virus. Another example could involve the protagonist faced with insurmountable odds and ultimately being killed without accomplishing his goal, despite what appears to be a turning point for the character.

'''Codevelopment''' is a trend of thought and a development strategy in [[development studies]]
which considers [[Human migration|migrants]] to be a developing factor for their countries of origin.

Although it is widely accepted that it was [[France|French]] scholar [[Sami Naïr]] who first coined the word codevelopment, it is believed this phenomenon has existed alongside migrations since they exist. Traditionally, immigrants (especially those who migrate for economic reasons) have, collectively or individually, supported their communities of origin.

In 1997 Sami Naïr, while directing the Interministerial Mission on Migration/Codevelopment, defined this last concept as ''a proposal for integrating immigration and development in a way that migration fluxes will benefit both the country of origin and the country of destination. This is, a consensual relationship between two countries that will allow migration to the country of destiny not to imply an equivalent loss in the country of origin''.

Adherents to this model believe that it fosters mutual collaboration among countries in a way that traditional and hierarchical north-south development focus did not.
In this context, immigrant initiatives enrich the countries of origin both from a cultural and a [[human resources]] perspective. Their condition as transnational citizens would allow them a better understanding of the needs of both the communities of origin and destination.
For this reason, their participation in projects involving members of their communities, in both “their” countries would be more effective, as priorities and needs would be correctly identified.
On the other hand, this participation would also work as an integrating force in the destination countries, as they would be perceived as an enriching factor by the public opinion and institutions.

== Codevelopment and migration control ==

In countries receiving immigration, codevelopment has been implemented by the institutions in a different way. Since they were first implemented in France, codevelopment initiatives in Europe have been frequently linked to control of the migration fluxes, often promoting the return of immigrants.

At a European level, codevelopment was first mentioned during the [[Tampere Summit]] held in October 1999, when the [[European Council]] defined 5 guidelines for the new European migration policy aimed at a common space of ''"Liberty, Security and Justice".''
Anyhow, critics consider that Tampere quickly shifted towards a [[Fortress Europe]] mentality, limiting [[development aid]] to those countries willing to implement migration control measures and accepting repatriations.

An example of this tendency may be found in the imbalance between de 23 million euro budget that the [[European Union|EU]] plans on investing in the [[Schengen Information System]] and the [[Visa Information System]] (aimed at a further immigrant identification and control) with the 3 million euro budget (4 million in its second year) granted to codevelopment projects.

== Codevelopment in Spain ==

Since the late nineties, codevelopment has been the subject of postgraduate studies, specialist courses, discussions and forums among multiple stakeholders, as well as calls for project grants by some local and regional administrations, beginning with the Municipality of Madrid.  These authorities quickly became aware of the local impact of the presence of new immigrant communities, the importance of the links that bind them with their communities of origin, and the desirability of relating them in any future action to support the policies of cooperation. Codevelopment policies had a much stronger presence and development in the regional and local levels.

At the state level, in accordance with Tampere Summit on Migration, the GRECO Plan on migration management (Programa Global de Regulación y Coordinación de la Extranjería y la Inmigración 2000-2004), was launched by the Interior Ministry in 2001. This Plan devoted an important space for “joint development”, in line with the policies of Tampere and the French government. GRECO insisted on technical and educational cooperation, the voluntary return of migrants, the channelling of migrants’ remittances to development projects, and finally, on the cooperation with those governments that were ready to accept the returned illegal migrants, as well as to control the exit of their citizens with destination Spain. However, codevelopment was not even mentioned as a policy line in the Immigration law passed in 2000, and did not receive proper funding within the GRECO’s framework.

Since ending 2004, codevelopment policies have been open to discussion, including the contents, limits, and plans. Two state agencies claimed their space in codevelopment actions: the State Secretary for International Cooperation, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the brand new General Directorate of Immigrants’ Integration, at the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.

===Codevelopment policy ===

During 2005 there has been progress in the search for a consensus on competences and actors. A codevelopment line was mainstreamed in the Master Plans on Development Cooperation, and two years later, also in the new Integration Plan, called Strategic Plan on Citizenship and Integration 2007-2010, which was finally implemented in 2007, by the Ministry of Labour and Migration.

Regional and local authorities soon adopted this win/win approach and consequently launched several codevelopment guidelines within their Integration Plans and Development Cooperation Strategies. Ending 2009, most of the Spanish Regions (Comunidades Autónomas) had considered codevelopment and had set up budget lines both for migrants' associations and Development NGOs. Graciela Malgesini argues that codevelopment and migrants' remittances partly redirect the decentralized cooperation funds to their countries of origin.

===Current definitions of codevelopment ===

In the last ten years, academic research on codevelopment increased, as a result of the strong immigration process experienced by the Spanish society from 2000 onwards (which represented nearly 80% of Spain’s demographic growth). Many universities decided to open up new learning courses on the matter, following the steps of the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. Several doctoral thesis are currently being carried out, focusing diverse aspects of codevelopment, including the impact of migration and remittances in the sending countries, mainly Ecuador, Colombia and Morocco. Migrants living in Spain remitted nearly EURO 10 thousands millions, in 2007 (while the overall Spanish OAD summed only half of this amount).

According to Graciela Malgesini, spontaneous codevelopment could be defined as the win/win effect, the linkage between migration and development, which generates mostly positive impacts on both the society of origin of immigrants, and the host society. This definition presumes the role of immigrants as actors and vectors of development, in "both sides", and the understanding of the relations between host countries (North) and sending countries (South) in a horizontal way. Codevelopment is directly related to Transnationalism.

Carlos Gimenez pinpointed other two characteristics of codevelopment: (1) The multiplicity of stakeholders (a network of participants that surpasses both quantitatively and qualitatively the traditional agents in the traditional development cooperation projects, as it includes authorities, social organizations, trade unions, universities, training institutes, businesses and immigrant associations). (2) Transnational citizenship (immigrants acting in codevelopment activities, embedded in a transnational dynamic, are also transnational citizens, to the extent that they have a dual presence. This dual space of belonging, in turn, encourages decision making, influences on the economic, political and social development, and allows the formation of a separate identity, based on two geographical areas, the country of origin and the country of destination).

===Codevelopment in practice ===

Transnationalism and codevelopment are spreading.In Latin America, covedelopment is a relatively new idea, but it has been embraced by grassroots organizations. For example, on November 25, 2010, FAMIGRANTES—the Federation of associations gathering migrants' family members in South America—gathered in their 4th Meeting on Migration and Codevelopment, in Rosario, Argentina. They stated that the codevelopment approach was the best way of understanding the contribution that their relatives were making both in the reception countries and in their homelands (www.famigrantes.org and www.famisur.org). At the same time, more than 100 migrants' associations launched FEDACOD (Federation of Associations for Codevelopment) in Valencia, Spain, on September 24, 2010 (www.fedacod.com).

'''[[Custom (law)|Custom]] in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]]''' is the repeated and constant performance of certain acts for a defined period of time, which, with the approval of the competent legislator, thereby acquire the force of law.&lt;ref name=Metz39&gt;Metz, ''What is Canon Law?'', pg. 39&lt;/ref&gt; A custom is an unwritten law introduced by the continuous acts of the faithful with the consent of the legitimate legislator.

Custom may be considered as a fact and as a law. As a fact, it is simply the frequent and free repetition of acts concerning the same thing; as a law, it is the result and consequence of that fact. Hence its name, which is derived from ''consuesco'' or ''consuefacio'' and denotes the frequency of the action. (Cap. Consuetudo v, Dist. I.)

In order for custom to become a source of law, it must be approved by the competent legislator.&lt;ref name=Metz39/&gt; Custom in canon law is not simply created by the people through their constant performance of a certain act,&lt;ref name=Metz39/&gt; but it is the constant performance of a certain act, with the intention of making a custom, which is approved by the competent legislator, thereby acquiring the force of law. This is because of the Catholic ecclesiological teaching on the constitution of the Catholic Church,&lt;ref name=Metz39/&gt; which states that Christ constituted the Church by divine delegation of power to the hierarchical authorities; the Church was not created by the [[consent of the governed]], but by the direct will of Christ.

==Divisions of custom==

* (a) Considered according to extent, a custom is universal, if received by the whole Church; or general (though under another aspect, particular), if observed in an entire country or province; or special, if it obtains among smaller but perfect societies; or most special (''specialissima'') if among private individuals and imperfect societies. The last-named cannot elevate a custom into a legitimate law.
* (b) Considered according to duration, custom is prescriptive or non-prescriptive. The former is subdivided, according to the amount of time requisite for a custom of fact to become a custom of law, into ordinary (i. e. ten or forty years) and immemorial.
* (c) Considered according to method of introduction, a custom is judicial or extrajudicial. The first is that derived from forensic usage or precedent. This is of great importance in ecclesiastical circles, as the same prelates are generally both legislators and judges, i. e. the pope and bishops. Extrajudicial custom is introduced by the people, but its sanction becomes the more easy the larger the number of learned or prominent men who embrace it.
* (d) Considered in its relation to law, a custom is according to law (''juxta legem'') when it interprets or confirms an existing statute; or beside the law (''prœter legem'') when no written legislation on the subject exists; or contrary to law (''contra legem'') when it derogates from or abrogates a statute already in force.

==Legal conditions for custom==

The true efficient cause of an ecclesiastical custom, in as far as it constitutes law, is solely the consent of the competent legislating authority. All church laws imply spiritual jurisdiction, which resides in the hierarchy alone, and, consequently, the faithful have no legislative power, either by Divine right or canonical statute. Therefore, the express or tacit consent of the church authority is necessary to give a custom the force of an ecclesiastical law. This consent is denominated legal when, by general statute and antecedently, reasonable customs receive approbation. Ecclesiastical custom differs, therefore, radically from civil custom. For, though both arise from a certain conspiration and accord between the people and the lawgivers, yet in the Church the entire juridical force of the custom is to be obtained from the consent of the hierarchy while in the civil state, the people themselves are one of the real sources of the legal force of custom. Custom, as a fact, must proceed from the community, or at least from the action of the greater number constituting the community. These actions must be free, uniform, frequent, and public, and performed with the intention of imposing an obligation. The usage, of which there is question. must also be of a reasonable nature. Custom either introduces a new law or abrogates an old one. But a law, by its very concept, is an ordination of reason, and so no law can be constituted by an unreasonable custom. Moreover, as an existing statute cannot be revoked except for just cause, it follows that the custom which is to abrogate the old law must be reasonable, for otherwise the requisite justice would be wanting. A custom, considered as a fact, is unreasonable when it is contrary to Divine law, positive or natural; or when it is prohibited by proper ecclesiastical authority; or when it is the occasion of sin and opposed to the common good.

A custom must also have a legitimate prescription. Such prescription is obtained by a continuance of the act in question during a certain length of time. No canonical statute has positively defined what this length of time is, and so its determination is left to the wisdom of canonists. Authors generally hold that for the legalizing of a custom in accordance with or beside the law (''juxta'' or ''prœter legem'') a space of ten years is sufficient; while for a custom contrary (''contra'') to law many demand a lapse of forty years. The reason given for the necessity of so long a space as forty years is that the community will only slowly persuade itself of the opportuneness of abrogating the old and embracing the new law. The opinion, however, which holds that ten years suffices to establish a custom even contrary to the law may be safely followed. It is to be noted, however, that in practice the Roman Congregations scarcely tolerate or permit any custom, even an immemorial one, contrary to the sacred canons. (Cf. Gasparri, De Sacr. Ordin., n. 53, 69 sq.) In the introduction of a law by prescription, it is assumed that the custom was introduced in good faith, or at least through ignorance of the opposite law. If, however, a custom be introduced through connivance (''viâ conniventiœ''), good faith is not required, for, as a matter of fact, bad faith must, at least in the beginning, be presupposed. As, however, when there is question of connivance, the proper legislator must know of the formation of the custom and yet does not oppose it when he could easily do so, the contrary law is then supposed to be abrogated directly by the tacit revocation of the legislator. A custom which is contrary to good morals or to the natural or Divine positive law is always to be rejected as an abuse, and it can never be legalized.

==Force of custom==

The effects of a custom vary with the nature of the act which has caused its introduction, i. e. according as the act is in accord with (''juxta''), or beside (''prœter''), or contrary (''contra'') to, the written law.

* (a) The first (''juxta legem'') does not constitute a new law in the strict sense of the word; its effect is rather to confirm and strengthen an already existing statute or to interpret it. Hence the axiom of jurists: Custom is the best interpreter of laws. Custom, indeed, considered as a fact, is a witness to the true sense of a law and to the intention of the legislator. If, then, it bring about that a determinate sense be obligatorily attached to an indeterminate legal phrase, it takes rank as an authentic interpretation of the law and as such acquires true binding-force. Wernz (Jus Decretalium, n. 191) refers to this same principle as explaining why the oft-recurring phrase in ecclesiastical documents, "the existing discipline of the Church, approved by the Holy See", indicates a true norm and an obligatory law.
* (b) The second species of custom (''prœter legem'') has the force of a new law, binding upon the entire community both in the internal and external forum. Unless a special exception can be proved, the force of such a custom extends to the introduction of prohibitive, permissive, and preceptive statutes, as well as to penal and nullifying enactments.
* (c) Thirdly, a custom contrary (''contra'') to law has the effect of abrogating, entirely or in part, an already existing ordinance, for it has the force of a new and later law. As regards penal ecclesiastical legislation, such a custom may directly remove an obligation in conscience, while the duty of submission to the punishment for transgressing the old precept may remain, provided the punishment in question be not a censure nor so severe a chastisement as necessarily presupposes a grave fault. On the other hand, this species of custom may also remove the punishment attached to a particular law, while the law itself remains obligatory as to its observance.

Immemorial custom, provided it be shown that circumstances have so changed as to make the custom reasonable, has power to abrogate or change any human law, even though a clause had been originally added to it forbidding any custom to the contrary. To immemorial custom is also attached the unusual force of inducing a presumption of the existence of an Apostolic privilege, provided the said privilege be not reckoned among abuses, and the holder of the presumed privilege be a person legally capable of acquiring the thing in question without first obtaining a special and express Apostolic permission for it (cf. Wernz, op. cit., who has been followed particularly in this paragraph). Ferraris notes that no immemorial custom, if it be not confirmed by Apostolic privilege, express or presumptive, can have any force for the abrogation of ecclesiastical liberties or immunities, inasmuch as both canon and civil law declare such custom to be unreasonable by its very nature. In general, it may be said that a valid custom, in both the constitution and the abrogation of laws, produces the same effects as a legislative act.

==Concerning Tridentine decrees==

A special question has been raised by some canonists as to whether the laws of the Council of Trent may be changed or abrogated by custom, even if immemorial, or whether all such contrary customs should not be rejected as abuses. Some of these writers restrict their denial of the value of contrary customs to ordinary, some also to immemorial ones (cf. Lucidi, De Vis. Sac. Lim., I, ch. iii, n. 111). It is unquestionably a general principle in canon law, that custom can change the disciplinary statutes even of œcumenical councils. The main reason for rejecting this principle in favour of the Tridentine enactments in particular is that any contrary custom would certainly be unreasonable and therefore unjustifiable. It is by no means evident, however, that all such contrary customs must necessarily be unreasonable, as is plain from the fact that some authors allow and others deny the value of immemorial customs in the premises, even when they agree in reprobating the force of ordinary customs. As a matter of fact, there is no decree of the Sacred Congregation of the Council which declares, absolutely and generally, that all customs contrary to the laws of the Council of Trent are invalid. Moreover, the Tribunal of the Rota has allowed the force of immemorial customs contrary to the disciplinary decrees of Trent, and the Sacred Congregation of the Council has at least tolerated them in secondary matters. A salient instance of the Roman official view is the statement of the Holy Office (11 March 1868) that the Tridentine decree on clandestine marriages, even after promulgation, was abrogated in some regions by contrary custom (Collect. S. C. de Prop. Fid., n. 1408). The confirmation of the Council of Trent by Pope Pius IV (26 Jan., 1564; 17 Feb., 1565) abolishes, it is true, all contrary existing customs, but the papal letters contain nothing to invalidate future customs. Owing to the comparatively recent date of the Council of Trent and the urgency of the Holy See that its decrees be observed, it is not easy for a contrary custom to arise, but whenever the conditions of a legitimate custom are fulfilled, there is no reason why the Tridentine decrees should be more immune than those of any other œcumenical council (cfr. Laurentius, op. cit., below, n. 307).

==Cessation of custom==

Any custom is to be rejected whose existence as such cannot be proved legally. A custom is a matter of fact, and therefore its existence must be tested in the same way as the existence of other alleged facts is tested. In this particular, the decrees of synods, the testimony of the diocesan ordinary and of other persons worthy of credence are of great value. Proofs are considered the stronger the more closely they approximate public and official monuments. If there be a question of proving an immemorial custom, the witnesses must be able to affirm that they themselves have been cognizant of the matter at issue for a space of at least forty years, that they have heard it referred to by their progenitors as something always observed, and that neither they nor their fathers have ever been aware of any fact to the contrary. If the fact of the existence of an alleged custom is not sufficiently proved, it is to be rejected as constituting a source of law. Customs may be revoked by a competent ecclesiastical legislator, in the same way and for the same reasons as other ordinances are abrogated. A later general law contrary to a general custom will nullify the latter, but a particular custom will not be abrogated by a general law, unless a clause to that effect be inserted. Even such a nullifying clause will not be sufficient for the abrogation of immemorial customs. The latter must be mentioned explicitly, for they are held not to be included in any general legal phrase, however sweeping its terms may be. Customs may likewise be abrogated by contrary customs, or they may lose their legal force by the mere fact that they fall into desuetude. Finally, an authentic declaration that a custom is absolutely contrary to good morals (''rumpens nervum disciplinœ'') and detrimental to the interests of the hierarchy or of the faithful deprives it of its supposed legal value.

'''Dermatoglyphics''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] ''derma'', "skin", and ''[[glyph]]'', "carving") is the scientific study of [[fingerprint]]s, lines, mounts and shapes of hands. Dermatoglyphics refers to the making of naturally occurring ridges on certain body parts, namely palms, fingers, soles, and toes. These are areas where hair usually does not grow, and these ridges allow for increased leverage when picking up objects or walking barefoot. The fingerprints of both hands are not the same. They do not change size or shape throughout a person's life, except in cases of serious injuries that scar the [[dermis]].

As a term, dermatoglyphics is used to distinguish it from the superficially similar [[pseudoscience]] of [[palmistry]]. Recently, the scientific basis underlying dermatoglyphics was questioned by the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in a 2009 report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sciences|first1=National Academy of|title=Strengthening Forensic Science: A Path Forward|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/12589/strengthening-forensic-science-in-the-united-states-a-path-forward|publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]]|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for relying on subjective comparisons instead of conclusions drawn from the [[scientific method]].

==Dermatoglyphics and genetic aberrations==
Dermatoglyphics, when correlated with [[Genetic disorder|genetic abnormalities]], is useful in the diagnosis of these disorders at birth or soon after. They aid in the diagnosis of [[Birth defect|congenital malformations]].

==History==
The scientific study of [[Dermis#Dermal papillae|papillary ridges]] of the hands and feet is credited as the beginning with the work of [[Jan Evangelista Purkyně]] in 1823.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grzybowski |first1=Andrzej |last2=Pietrzak |first2=Krzysztof |title=Jan Evangelista Purkynje (1787-1869): first to describe fingerprints |journal=[[Clinics in Dermatology]] |date=2015 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=117–121 |doi=10.1016/j.clindermatol.2014.07.011 |pmid=25530005 |issn=1879-1131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir William Herschel, 2nd Baronet]] (1858) was the first to experiment with fingerprints in India.

Sir [[Francis Galton]] (1892) conducted extensive research on the importance of skin ridge patterns to demonstrate their permanence, but also their use for identification. In 1892, Galton published the book ''Fingerprints'' and in doing so advanced the science of fingerprint identification.

Sir [[Edward Henry]] (1893) published the book ''The classification and uses of fingerprints'' which established the modern era of fingerprint identification, which is now the basis for other classification systems.

[[Harold Cummins]] and Charles Midlo M D (1929) together with others published a widely referred book ''Fingerprints, Palms and soles'', a bible in the field of Dermatoglyphics.

[[Lionel Penrose]] (1945), inspired by the works of Cummins and Midlo, conducted his own dermatoglyphic investigations as a further aspect of his research into Down's syndrome and other congenital medical disorders.

Schaumann and Alter (1976) published a book ''Dermatoglyphics in Medical disorders'' which summarizes the findings of dermatoglyphic patterns in disease conditions.

Seltzer, et al. (1982) conducted a study on patients with breast cancer, and concluded that the presence of six or more whorls on the fingertips of a person provided a high risk for breast cancer.

The current state of medical dermatoglyphics is that the diagnosis of illnesses can now be done with dermatoglyphic analysis alone. Currently, dermatoglyphic researchers claim a high degree of accuracy in their prognostic ability from the hand features.

'''Di-deuterated ethyl linoleate''' (also known as RT001; Di-deuterated linoleic acid ethyl ester, 11,11-D2-Ethyl Linoleate, Ethyl 11,11-D2-Linoleate)&lt;ref&gt;https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/124037379&lt;/ref&gt; is an experimental, orally-bioavailable synthetic deuterated [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]] (PUFA), an isotopologue of an essential [[omega-6]] PUFA, [[linoleic acid]]. The [[deuterated drug|deuterated]] compound, while identical to natural linoleic acid, is resistant to [[lipid peroxidation]] which makes studies of its [[Lipid_peroxidation#Inhibiting_lipid_peroxidation|cell-protective]] properties worthwhile. 

==Clinical development==
Investigations of 11,11-D2-Ethyl linoleate (RT001) are being conducted in several neurological indications, including [[Friedreich’s ataxia]] and [[Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy]]. A double-blind [[Clinical_trial#Active_control_studies|comparator-controlled]] Phase I/II clinical trial sponsored by [[Retrotope]] and [[Friedreich’s Ataxia Research Alliance]] was conducted to determine the safety profile and appropriate dosing for consequent trials.&lt;ref&gt; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02445794&lt;/ref&gt; RT001 was promptly absorbed and was found to be safe and tolerable over 28 days at the maximal dose of 9 g/day. It improved [[peak workload]] and [[VO2 max|peak oxygen consumption]] in the test group compared to the control group who received the equal doses of normal, non-deuterated ethyl linoleate.&lt;ref&gt;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mds.27353&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2018 RT001 was given to a patient with [[ALS]] under a "compassionate use scheme".&lt;ref&gt;https://alsnewstoday.com/2018/09/18/experimental-rt001-available-for-als-under-expanded-access-program/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
Di-deuterated linoleic acid is recognized by cells as identical to the natural linoleic acid. But when taken up, it is converted into 13,13-D2-arachidonic acid, a heavy isotope version of [[arachidonic_acid]], that gets incorporated into lipid membranes. The deuterated compound resists the non-enzymatic [[lipid peroxidation]] (LPO) through a non-antioxidant based mechanism that protects mitochondrial, neuronal and other lipid membranes, thereby greatly reducing the levels of numerous LPO-derived toxic products such as [[4-Hydroxynonenal|reactive carbonyls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{PMID|22705367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fair trade''' is a foundation whose stated goal is to help producers in [[developing country|developing countries]] achieve better trading conditions. Members of the movement advocate the payment of higher prices to exporters, as well as improved social and [[environmental law|environmental standards]]. The movement focuses in particular on commodities, or products which are typically exported from developing countries to [[developed country|developed countries]], but also consumed in domestic markets (e.g. Brazil, India and Bangladesh) most notably [[handicrafts]], [[Economics of coffee|coffee]], [[Cocoa bean#Production|cocoa]], wine, sugar, fresh fruit, [[chocolate]], flowers and gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Brough | first = David | url = http://ca.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idCAL213911220080110 | title = Briton finds ethical jewellery good as gold | newspaper = Reuters | place = [[North America|NA]] | date = January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Moseley | first = WG | year = 2008 | title = Fair Trade Wine: North Africa's Post Apartheid Vineyards and the YouTube Global Economy| journal = Globalizations | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 291–304 | doi=10.1080/14747730802057753}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement seeks to promote greater equity in international trading partnerships through dialogue, [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]], and respect. It promotes [[sustainable development]] by offering better trading conditions to, and securing the rights of, marginalized producers and workers in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title =WFTO | url = http://www.wfto.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1082&amp;Itemid=334&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fair trade is grounded in three core beliefs; first, producers have the power to express unity with consumers. Secondly, the world trade practices that currently exist promote the unequal [[distribution of wealth]] between nations. Lastly, buying products from producers in developing countries at a fair price is a more efficient way of promoting sustainable development than traditional charity and aid.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Fair Trade from the Ground Up|last = Linton|first = April|publisher = University of Washington Press|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0-295-99172-6|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fair trade labelling organizations commonly use a definition of ''fair trade'' developed by [[FINE]], an informal association of four international fair trade networks: [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]], [[World Fair Trade Organization]] (WFTO), [[Network of European Worldshops]] and [[European Fair Trade Association]] (EFTA). Specifically, fair trade is a trading partnership, based on dialogue, [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]], and respect, that seeks greater equity in international trade. Fair trade organizations, backed by consumers, are engaged actively in supporting producers, [[raising awareness|awareness raising]], and in campaigning for changes in the rules and practice of conventional international trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = What | publisher = European fair trade association | url = http://www.european-fair-trade-association.org/efta/Doc/What.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several recognized fair trade certifiers, including [[FLO International|Fairtrade International]] (formerly called FLO, Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International), IMO, [[Make Trade Fair]] and Eco-Social. Additionally, [[Fair Trade USA]], formerly a licensing agency for the Fairtrade International label, broke from the system and is implementing its own fair trade labelling scheme, which has resulted in controversy due to its inclusion of independent smallholders and estates for all crops. In 2008, Fairtrade International certified approximately (€3.4B) of products.&lt;ref name="FLO2008"&gt;{{Citation | title = Facts &amp; figures | publisher = Fair trade | url = http://www.fairtrade.net/facts_and_figures.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = WTO | url = http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/statis_e/its2006_e/its06_general_overview_e.pdf |format=PDF |title= General overview | year = 2006 | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Trade Organization]] publishes annual figures on the world trade of goods and services.

The fair trade movement is popular in the UK, where there are 500 Fairtrade towns, 118 universities, over 6,000 churches, and over 4,000 UK schools registered in the Fairtrade Schools Scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Paull | first = J | year = 2011 | contribution-url = http://orgprints.org/19527/1/Paull2011FairtradeISOFAR.pdf | contribution = The Fairtrade movement: Six lessons for the organics sector | title = Proceedings of the Third Scientific Conference of the International Society of Organic Agriculture Research | place = Namyangju, Korea | pages = 317–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, over 1.2 million farmers and workers in more than 60 countries participated in Fairtrade International's fair trade system, which included €65 million in fairtrade premium paid to producers for use developing their communities.&lt;ref name="fairtrade2009"&gt;{{Citation | title = Annual report | publisher = Fair trade | format = PDF | year = 2009 | url = http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/resources/2011-12_AnnualReport_web_version_small_FairtradeInternational.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fairtrade International, nearly six out of ten consumers have seen the Fairtrade mark and almost nine in ten of them trust it.&lt;ref name="fairtrade2009"/&gt;

Some criticisms have been raised about fair trade systems. One 2015 study in a journal published by the [[MIT Press]] concluded that producer benefits were close to zero because there was an oversupply of certification, and only a fraction of produce classified as fair trade was actually sold on fair trade markets, just enough to recoup the costs of certification.&lt;ref name="mitpressjournals.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Janvry|first1=Alain|last2=McIntosh|first2=Craig|last3=Sadoulet|first3=Elisabeth|title=Fair Trade and Free Entry: Can a Disequilibrium Market Serve as a Development Tool?|journal=The Review of Economics and Statistics|date=July 2015|volume=97|issue=3|pages=567–73|doi=10.1162/REST_a_00512}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research indicates that the implementation of certain fair trade standards can cause greater inequalities in some markets where these rigid rules are inappropriate for the specific market.&lt;ref name="Booth, P 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Booth | first1 = P. | last2 = Whetstone | first2 = L. | year = 2007 | title = Half a Cheer for Fair Trade | url = | journal = Economic Affairs | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 29–36 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0270.2007.00727.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perso2010"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carimentrand|first1= A.|last2= Ballet|first2= J. |year=2010|title= When Fair Trade increases unfairness: The case of quinoa from Bolivia|url= http://ethique.perso.sfr.fr/Working%20paper%20FREE-Cahier%20FREE%20n%B05-2010.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doppler, F. 2006"&gt;Working paper FREE-Cahier FREE n°5-2010; Doppler, F., &amp; Cabañas, A.A.

Positive and normative analysis from a value chain perspective', Journal of Business Ethics, 86, 3–26. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; One proposed alternative to fair trade is [[direct trade]], which eliminates the overhead of the fair trade certification, and allows suppliers to receive higher prices much closer to the retail value of the end product.  Some suppliers use relationships started in a fair trade system to autonomously springboard into direct sales relationships they negotiate themselves, whereas other direct trade systems are supplier-initiated for social responsibility reasons similar to a fair trade system.

== System ==
There are a large number of fair trade and ethical marketing organizations employing different [[marketing strategies]].{{Sfn | Ballet | Carimentrand | 2010}} Most fair trade marketers believe it is necessary to sell the products through supermarkets to get a sufficient [[volume of trade]] to affect the developing world.{{Sfn | Ballet | Carimentrand | 2010}} The Fairtrade brand is by far the biggest of the fair trade [[coffee]] brands.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Packers in developed countries pay a fee to The Fairtrade Foundation for the right to use the brand and logo, and nearly all the fee goes to marketing. Packers and retailers can charge as much as they want for the coffee. The coffee has to come from a certified fair trade cooperative, and there is a minimum price when the world market is oversupplied. Additionally, the cooperatives are paid an additional 10c per lb premium by buyers for [[community development]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Bowes | first = John | year = 2010 | title = The Fair Trade Revolution | place = London | publisher = Pluto Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Pages needed |date=December 2014}} The cooperatives can, on average, sell only a third of their output as fair trade, because of lack of demand, and sell the rest at world prices.{{Sfn | Mohan | 2010}}{{Pages needed | date = December 2014}}{{Sfn | Kilian | Jones | Pratt | Villalobos | 2006}}{{Sfn | Berndt | 2007}}{{Sfn | Kohler | 2006}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Renard | first1 = MC | first2 = VP | last2 = Grovas | year = 2007 | chapter = 9.

Some go to meeting the costs of conformity and certification: as they have to meet fair trade standards on all their produce, they have to recover the costs from a small part of their turnover,{{Sfn | Berndt | 2007}} sometimes as little as 8%,{{Sfn | Riedel | Lopez | Widdows | Manji | 2005}} and may not make any profit. Some meet other costs. Some is spent on social projects such as building schools, health clinics and baseball pitches. Sometimes there is money left over for the farmers. The cooperatives sometimes pay farmers a higher price than farmers do, sometimes less, but there is no evidence on which is more common.&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections"&gt;{{Citation | last = Speaker | first = Griffiths | title = Why Fair trade isn't | url = http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm}}{{Self-published source|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The marketing system for fair trade and non-fair trade coffee is identical in the consuming countries, using mostly the same importing, packing, distributing and retailing firms. Some independent brands operate a "virtual company", paying importers, packers and distributors and advertising agencies to handle their brand, for cost reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, IA and A Crane, "Ethical Decision Making in Fair Trade Companies". ''Journal of Business Ethics'' 45: 79–92, 2003. p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; In the producing country, fair trade is marketed only by fair trade cooperatives, while other coffee is marketed by fair trade cooperatives (as uncertified coffee), by other cooperatives and by ordinary traders.{{Sfn | Mohan | 2010}}{{Sfn | Kilian | Jones | Pratt | &amp; Villalobos | 2006}}{{Sfn | Berndt | 2007}}{{Sfn | Riedel | Lopez | Widdows | Manji | 2005}}{{Sfn | Kohler | 2006}}

To become certified fair trade producers, the primary cooperative and its member farmers must operate to certain political standards, imposed from Europe. FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;ref name="FLOCERT"&gt;{{Citation | title = FLO-Cert | url = http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090918131636/http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en | archivedate = 2009-09-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[fair trade debate]] there are many complaints of failure to enforce these standards, with producers, cooperatives, importers and packers profiting by evading them.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, LT 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Utting, K 2009, p 139"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = J | last1 = Valkila| last2 = Haaparanta | first2 = P | last3 = Niemi | first3 = N | year = 2010 | title = Empowering Coffee Traders?

== Effect on growers ==
Fair trade is benefiting farmers in developing countries, whether that be considerably or just a little. The nature of fair trade makes it a global phenomenon, therefore, there are diverse motives for understanding group formation related to fair trade. The social transformation caused by the fair trade movement also varies around the world.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

[[File:Young women soil testing.jpg|thumb|Three young Nicaraguan women demonstrate to visiting US buyers and consumers the use of organic soil testing methods.|alt=Teaching organic soil testing in Nicaragua.]]

A study of coffee growers in [Guatemala illustrates the effect of fair trade practices on growers. In this study, thirty-four farmers were interviewed. Of those thirty-four growers, twenty-two had an understanding of fair trade based on internationally recognized definitions, for example, describing fair trade in market and economical terms or knowing what the social premium is and how their cooperative has used it. Three growers explained a deep understanding of fair trade, showing a knowledge of both fair market principles and how fair trade affects them socially. Nine growers had erroneous or no knowledge of Fair Trade.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The three growers who had a deeper knowledge of the social implications of fair trade all have responsibilities within their cooperatives. One is a manager, one is in charge of the wet mill, and one is his group's treasurer. These farmers did not have a pattern in terms of years of education, age, or years of membership in the cooperative; their answers to the questions, "Why did you join?" differentiate them from other members and explain why they have such an extensive knowledge of fair trade. These farmers cited switching to organic farming, wanting to raise money for social projects, and more training offered as reasons for joining the cooperative, other than receiving a better price for their coffee.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Many farmers around the world are unaware of fair trade practices that they could be implementing to earn a higher wage. Coffee is one of the most highly traded commodities in the world, yet the farmers who grow it typically earn less than $2 a day.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Fair Trade Awareness and Engagement: A Coffee Farmer's Perspective|last = Fergus|first = Andrew|date = 2014|journal = Journal of the Center of Business Ethics, Bentley University|doi = 10.1111/basr.12037|pmid = |last2 = Gray |volume=119 |issue = 3|pages=359–384}}&lt;/ref&gt; When surveyed, farmers from Cooperativa Agraria Cafetalera Pangoa (CAC Pangoa) in San Martín de Pangoa, Peru, could answer positively that they have heard about fair trade, but were not able to give a detailed description about what fair trade is. They could, however, identify fair trade based on some of its possible benefits to their community. When asked, overall, farmers cited that fair trade has had a positive effect on their lives and communities. They also wanted consumers to know that fair trade is important for supporting their families and their [[cooperatives]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some producers also profit from the indirect benefits of fair trade practices. Fair trade cooperatives create a space of solidarity and promote an entrepreneurial spirit among growers. When growers feel like they have control over their own lives within the network of their cooperative, it can be very empowering. Operating a profitable business allows growers to think about their future, rather than worrying about how they are going to survive in poverty.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As far as farmers' satisfaction with the fair trade system, the growers want consumers to know that fair trade has provided important support to their families and their cooperative. Overall, farmers are satisfied with the current fair trade system, but some farmers, such as the Mazaronquiari group from CAC Pangoa, desire yet a higher price for their products in order to live a higher quality of life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Social premium ===
A component of trade is the social premium that buyers of fair trade goods pay to the producers or producer-groups of such goods. An important factor of the fair trade social premium is that the producers or producer-groups decide where and how it is spent. These premiums usually go towards socioeconomic development, wherever the producers or producer-groups see fit. Within producer-groups, the decisions about how the social premium will be spent is handled democratically, with transparency and participation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Producers and producer-groups spend this social premium to support socioeconomic development in a variety of ways. One common way to spend the social premium of fair trade is to privately invest in public goods that infrastructure and the government are lacking in. These public goods include environment initiatives, public schools, and water projects. At some point, all producer-groups re-invest their social premium back into their farms and businesses. They buy capital, like trucks and machinery, and education for their members, like organic farming education. Thirty-eight percent of producer-groups spend the social premium in its entirety on themselves, but the rest invest in public goods, like paying for teachers' salaries, providing a community health care clinic, and improving infrastructure, such as bringing in electricity and bettering roads.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Farmers' organisations that use their social premium for public goods often finance educational scholarships. For example, Costa Rican coffee co-operative, Coocafé, has supported hundreds of children and youth at school and university through the financing of scholarships from funding from their fair trade social premium. In terms of education, the social premium can be used to build and furnish schools too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 50 Reasons to Buy Fair Trade|last = Litvinoff|first = Miles|publisher = Pluto Press|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-7453-2584-2|location = |pages = |last2 = Madeley|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations promoting fair trade ==
Most of the fair trade import organizations are members of, or certified by one of several national or international federations. These federations coordinate, promote, and facilitate the work of fair trade organizations. The following are some of the largest:
* The [[FLO International]] (Fairtrade International), created in 1997, is an association of three producer networks and twenty national labeling initiatives that develop Fairtrade standards, license buyers, label usage and market the [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark|Fair trade Certification Mark]] in consuming countries. The Fairtrade International labeling system is the largest and most widely recognized standard setting and certification body for [[Fairtrade labeling|labeled Fair trade]]. Formerly named Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International, it changed its name to Fairtrade International in 2009, when its producer certification and standard setting activities were separated into two separate, but connected entities. FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;ref name="FLOCERT" /&gt; Fairtrade International, the non-profit arm, oversees standards development and licensing organization activity. Only products from certain developing countries are eligible for certification, and for some products such as coffee and cocoa, certification is restricted to cooperatives. Cooperatives and large estates with hired labor may be certified for bananas, tea and other crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Fair trade | contribution = Generic standards | contribution-url = http://www.fairtrade.net/generic_standards.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fair Trade USA&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Fair trade | url = http://fairtradeusa.org/ | place = US}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an independent, nonprofit organization that sets standards, certifies, and labels products that promote sustainable livelihoods for farmers and workers and protect the environment. Founded in 1998, Fair Trade USA currently partners with around 800 brands, as well as 1.3 million farmers and workers across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | year = 2014 | title = General media kit | publisher = Fair trade | place = US | format = PDF | url = http://fairtradeusa.org/sites/default/files/General%20Media%20Kit%202014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Global Goods Partners]] (GGP), a fair-trade nonprofit organization, founded in 2005, which provides support and U.S. market access to women-led cooperatives in the developing world. 
* [[World Fair Trade Organization]] (formerly the International Fair Trade Association) is a global association created in 1989 of fair trade producer cooperatives and associations, export marketing companies, importers, retailers, national, and regional fair trade networks and fair trade support organizations. In 2004 WFTO launched the FTO Mark which identifies registered fair trade organizations (as opposed to the FLO system, which labels products).
* The [[Network of European Worldshops]] (NEWS!), created in 1994, is the umbrella network of 15 national [[worldshop]] associations in 13 different countries all over Europe.
* The [[European Fair Trade Association]] (EFTA), created in 1990, is a network of European [[alternative trading organization]]s which import products from some 400 economically disadvantaged producer groups in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. EFTA's goal is to promote fair trade and to make fair trade importing more efficient and effective. The organization also publishes yearly various publications on the evolution of the fair trade market. EFTA currently has eleven members in nine different countries.

In 1998, the first four federations listed above joined together as [[FINE]], an informal association whose goal is to harmonize fair trade standards and guidelines, increase the quality and efficiency of fair trade monitoring systems, and advocate fair trade politically.
* Additional certifiers include IMO (Fair for Life, Social and Fair Trade labels), Eco-Social and Fair Trade USA.
* The [[Fair Trade Federation]] (FTF), created in 1994, is an association of Canadian and American fair trade wholesalers, importers, and retailers. The organization links its members to fair trade producer groups while acting as a clearinghouse for information on fair trade and providing resources and networking opportunities to its members. Members self-certify adherence to defined fair trade principles for 100% of their purchasing/business. Those who sell products certifiable by Fairtrade International must be 100% certified by FI to join FTF.

Student groups have also been increasingly active in the past years promoting fair trade products.&lt;ref name="fairtradecampaigns.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairtradecampaigns.org/campaign-type/universities/ |title=Universities &amp;#124; Campaign Types |publisher=Fair Trade Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although hundreds of independent student organizations are active worldwide, most groups in North America are either affiliated with United Students for Fair Trade (USA, the Canadian Student Fair Trade Network (Canada), or Fair Trade Campaigns&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairtradecampaigns.org/|title=Fair Trade Campaigns|website=fairtradecampaigns.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (USA), which also houses Fair Trade Universities&lt;ref name="fairtradecampaigns.org" /&gt; and Fair Trade Schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairtradecampaigns.org/campaign-type/schools/ |title=Schools &amp;#124; Campaign Types |publisher=Fair Trade Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The involvement of church organizations has been and continues to be an integral part of the Fair Trade movement:

== History ==
{{Main article|History of fair trade}}
The first attempts to commercialize fair trade goods in Northern markets were initiated in the 1940s and 1950s by religious groups and various politically oriented [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs). Ten Thousand Villages, an NGO within the [[Mennonite Central Committee]] (MCC) and [[SERRV International]] were the first, in 1946 and 1949 respectively, to develop fair trade [[supply chain]]s in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = History | url = http://www.ifat.org/fthistory/history3.shtml | publisher = IFAT | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061215142239/http://www.ifat.org/fthistory/history3.shtml | archivedate = 2006-12-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The products, almost exclusively handicrafts ranging from [[jute]] goods to [[cross-stitch]] work, were mostly sold in churches or fairs. The goods themselves had often no other function than to indicate that a donation had been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Unisg | title = Oikos foundation | url = http://www.oikos-foundation.unisg.ch/homepage/fairtrade.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060823071706/http://www.oikos-foundation.unisg.ch/homepage/fairtrade.pdf | archivedate = 2006-08-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solidarity trade ===
[[File:Fair Trade Products.jpg|thumb|Fair trade goods sold in worldshops]]
The current fair trade movement was shaped in Europe in the 1960s. Fair trade during that period was often seen as a political gesture against neo-imperialism: radical student movements began targeting multinational corporations and concerns that traditional business models were fundamentally flawed started to emerge. The slogan at the time, "Trade not Aid", gained international recognition in 1968 when it was adopted by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) to put the emphasis on the establishment of fair trade relations with the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | archivedate = October 22, 2014 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141022065406/http://www.wfto.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=17&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=1 | url = http://www.wfto.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=17&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=1 |title= Where did it all begin?| accessdate = 24 June 2009 | date = 7 June 2009|publisher= WFTO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 1965 saw the creation of the first [[Alternative Trading Organization]] (ATO): that year, British NGO [[Oxfam]] launched "Helping-by-Selling", a program which sold imported handicrafts in Oxfam stores in the UK and from mail-order catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = One Village | place = Charlbury, UK |url= http://onevillage.org/fairtrade-history.htm |title = Fair trade history | last = Scott | first = Roy | date=2003-03-07 |accessdate= 2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1968, the oversized newsprint publication, the [[Whole Earth Catalog]], was connecting thousands of specialized merchants, artisans, and scientists directly with consumers who were interested in supporting independent producers, with the goal of bypassing corporate retail and department stores. The Whole Earth Catalog sought to balance the international free market by allowing direct purchasing of goods produced primarily in US and Canada, but also in Central and South America.

In 1969, the first [[worldshop]] opened its doors in the Netherlands. The initiative aimed at bringing the principles of fair trade to the retail sector by selling almost exclusively goods produced under fair trade terms in "underdeveloped regions". The first shop was run by volunteers and was so successful that dozens of similar shops soon went into business in the [[Benelux]] countries, Germany, and other Western European countries.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, important segments of the fair trade movement worked to find markets for products from countries that were excluded from the mainstream trading channels for political reasons. Thousands of volunteers sold coffee from Angola and Nicaragua in worldshops, in the back of churches, from their homes, and from stands in public places, using the products as a vehicle to deliver their message: give disadvantaged producers in developing countries a fair chance on the world's market.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}}

=== Handicrafts vs. agricultural goods ===
In the early 1980s, [[Alternative Trading Organizations]] faced major challenges: the novelty of some fair trade products began to wear off, demand reached a plateau, and some handicrafts began to look "tired and old fashioned" in the marketplace. The decline of segments of the handicrafts market forced fair trade supporters to rethink their business model and their goals. Moreover, several fair trade supporters during this period were worried by the contemporary effect on small farmers of structural reforms in the agricultural sector as well as the fall in [[commodity]] prices. Many of them came to believe it was the movement's responsibility to address the issue and remedies usable in the ongoing crisis in the industry.

In the subsequent years, fair trade agricultural commodities played an important role in the growth of many ATOs: successful on the market, they offered a much-needed, renewable source of income for producers and provided Alternative Trading Organizations a complement to the handicrafts market. The first fair trade agricultural products were tea and coffee, quickly followed by: dried fruits, cocoa, sugar, fruit juices, rice, spices and nuts. While in 1992, a sales value ratio of 80% handcrafts to 20% agricultural goods was the norm, in 2002 handcrafts amounted to 25% of fair trade sales while commodity food lines were up at 69%.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, A. &amp; Opal, C. (2004). Fair Trade: Market-Driven Ethical Consumption. London: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rise of labeling initiatives ===
[[File:Oldftlogos2.jpg|thumb|Early Fairtrade Certifications Marks]]&lt;!-- FAIR USE of Oldftlogos2.jpg: see image description page at [[:File:Oldftlogos2.jpg]] for rationale --&gt;Sales of fair trade products only really took off with the arrival of the first [[Fairtrade certification]] initiatives. Although buoyed by ever growing sales, fair trade had been generally contained to relatively small worldshops scattered across Europe and to a lesser extent, North America. Some felt that these shops were too disconnected from the rhythm and the lifestyle of contemporary developed societies. The inconvenience of going to them to buy only a product or two was too high even for the most dedicated customers. The only way to increase sale opportunities was to start offering fair trade products where consumers normally shop, in large distribution channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0743-0167(02)00051-7 | last = Renard | first = M-C | year= 2003| title = Fair Trade: quality, market and conventions | url = |journal=Journal of Rural Studies|volume=19 | pages =87–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was to find a way to expand distribution without compromising consumer trust in fair trade products and in their origins.

A solution was found in 1988, when the first Fairtrade certification initiative, [[Stichting Max Havelaar|Max Havelaar]], was created in the Netherlands under the initiative of [[Nico Roozen]], [[Frans Van Der Hoff]], and Dutch development NGO [[Solidaridad]]. The independent certification allowed the goods to be sold outside the worldshops and into the mainstream, reaching a larger consumer segment and boosting fair trade sales significantly. The [[Fairtrade labelling|labeling initiative]] also allowed customers and distributors alike to track the origin of the goods to confirm that the products were really benefiting the producers at the end of the supply chain.

The concept caught on: in the ensuing years, similar non-profit Fairtrade labelling organizations were set up in other European countries and North America. In 1997, a process of convergence among labelling organizations – or "LIs" (for "Labeling Initiatives") – led to the creation of Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (FLO). FLO is an umbrella organization whose mission is to set the Fairtrade standards, support, inspect and certify disadvantaged producers, and harmonize the Fairtrade message across the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/tasks.html | title = Main Tasks | work = Fair trade | accessdate = 27 January 2009 | year=2006 | publisher = FLO International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, FLO launched for the first time an International Fairtrade Certification Mark. The goals of the launch were to improve the visibility of the Mark on supermarket shelves, facilitate cross border trade, and simplify procedures for both producers and importers. At present, the certification mark is used in over 50 countries and on dozens of different products, based on FLO's certification for coffee, tea, rice, bananas, mangoes, cocoa, cotton, sugar, honey, fruit juices, nuts, fresh fruit, quinoa, herbs and spices, wine, [[Football (ball)|footballs]], etc.

With the rise of ethical labeling, consumers are able to take moral responsibility for their economic decisions and actions. This supports the notion of fair trade practices as "moral economies."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The presence of labeling give consumers the feeling of "doing the right thing" with a simple purchase.

These labeling practices place the burden of getting certification on the producers in the Global South, furthering inequality between the Global North and the Global South. The process of securing certification is excessively burdensome and expensive. Northern consumers are able to just make a simple choice without these burdens and expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Alternative production and consumption relations?: fair trade, the state, and cooperatives in the global South|journal = Journal of Contemporary African Studies|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 0258-9001|pages = 1–17|volume = 31|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/02589001.2012.752958|first = Michelle|last = Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychology ==
Consumers of fair trade products usually make the intentional choice to purchase fair trade goods based on attitude, moral norms, perceived behavioral control, and social norms. It is useful to include of measure of moral norms to improve the predictive power of intentions to buy fair trade over the basic predictors, like attitude and perceived behavioral control.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

University students have significantly increased their consumption of fair trade products over the last several decades. Women college students have a more favorable attitude than men toward buying fair trade products and they feel more morally obligated to do so. Women are also reported to have stronger intentions to buy fair trade products.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Gender Differences in Psychosocial Determinants of University Students' Intentions to Buy Fair Trade Products|last = Valois|first = Pierre|date = 16 May 2014|journal = Journal of Consumer Policy|doi = 10.1007/s10603-014-9262-4|pmid = |last2 = de Leeuw|last3 = Morin|last4 = Schmidt |volume=37 |issue = 4|pages=485–505}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to the intentions to buy fair trade products, gender had no direct effect.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Producers organize and strive for fair trade certification for several reasons, either through religious ties, wants for social justice, wants for autonomy, political liberalization, or simply because they want to be paid more for their labor efforts and products. Farmers are more likely to identify with [[organic farming]] than fair trade farming practices because organic farming is a very visible way that these farmers are different than their neighbors and it actually influences the way they farm. They place a significant importance on natural growing methods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fair trade farmers are also more likely to attribute their higher paid prices to the quality of their products rather than fair market prices.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Product certification ==
{{Main article|Fair trade certification}}
''Note: Customary spelling of Fairtrade is one word when referring to the FLO product labeling system, see [[Fairtrade certification]]''
[[File:Fairtrade Certification Mark.svg|thumb|200px|International Fairtrade Certification Mark]]
Fairtrade labelling (usually simply Fairtrade or Fair Trade Certified in the United States) is a certification system designed to allow consumers to identify goods which meet agreed standards. Overseen by a standard-setting body ([[FLO International]]) and a certification body ([[FLO-CERT]]), the system involves independent auditing of producers and traders to ensure the agreed standards are met. For a product to carry either the International Fairtrade Certification Mark or the [[Fair Trade Certified Mark]], it must come from FLO-CERT inspected and certified producer organizations. The crops must be grown and harvested in accordance with the international Fair trade standards set by FLO International. The supply chain must also have been monitored by FLO-CERT, to ensure the integrity of the labelled product.

Fairtrade certification purports to guarantee not only fair prices, but also the principles of [[ethical purchasing]]. These principles include adherence to ILO agreements such as those banning child and [[slave labour]], guaranteeing a safe workplace and the right to unionise, adherence to the [[United Nations]] charter of [[human rights]], a fair price that covers the cost of production and facilitates social development, and protection and conservation of the environment. The Fairtrade certification system also attempts to promote long-term business relationships between buyers and sellers, crop prefinancing, and greater transparency throughout the supply chain and more.

The Fairtrade certification system covers a growing range of products, including bananas, honey, coffee, oranges, Cocoa bean, cocoa, cotton, dried and fresh fruits and vegetables, juices, nuts and oil seeds, quinoa, rice, spices, sugar, tea, and wine. Companies offering products that meet the Fairtrade standards may apply for licences to use one of the Fairtrade Certification Marks for those products. The International Fairtrade Certification Mark was launched in 2002 by FLO, and replaced twelve Marks used by various Fairtrade labelling initiatives. The new Certification Mark is currently used worldwide (with the exception of the United States). The Fair Trade Certified Mark is still used to identify Fairtrade goods in the United States.

There is widespread confusion because the fair trade industry standards provided by Fairtrade International (The Fairtrade Labelling Organization) use the word "producer" in many different senses, often in the same specification document. Sometimes it refers to farmers, sometimes to the primary cooperatives they belong to, to the secondary cooperatives that the primary cooperatives belong to, or to the tertiary cooperatives that the secondary cooperatives may belong to&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-07-11_SPO_EN.pdf Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.

== WFTO Fair Trade Organization membership ==
In an effort to complement the Fairtrade product certification system and allow most notably handcraft producers to also sell their products outside worldshops, the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO) launched in 2004 a new Mark to identify fair trade organizations (as opposed to products in the case of FLO International and Fairtrade). Called the FTO Mark,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/the-fairtrade-marks.html |title=Fairtrade International (FLO): The Fairtrade Marks |publisher=Fairtrade.net |date=2017-09-17 |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; it allows consumers to recognize registered Fair Trade Organizations worldwide and seeks to guarantee that standards are being implemented regarding working conditions, wages, child labour, and the environment. The FTO Mark offers Fair Trade Organizations (including [[handcrafts]] producers) definable standards which inform consumers, business partners, governments, and donors of the applicable trading standard. in 2014 the Fairtrade Program Mark was introduced to create new sales opportunities, initially for cocoa, sugar and cotton producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fairtrade-sourcing-programs.html |title=Fairtrade International (FLO): Fairtrade International |publisher=Fairtrade.net |date=2017-09-17 |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the same round logo alongside the word '''FAIRTRADE''' in black and underneath the program title in '''&lt;span style="color:turquoise"&gt;turquoise&lt;/span&gt;'''.

== Alternative trading organizations ==
{{Main article|Alternative trading organization}}
[[File:Cafedirectcoffeeshop.JPG|thumb|right|[[Cafedirect]] coffee shop on [[Regent Street]] in central London.]]

An alternative trading organization (ATO) is usually a non-governmental organization (NGO) or mission-driven business aligned with the Fair Trade movement, aiming "to contribute to the alleviation of poverty in developing regions of the world by establishing a system of trade that allows marginalized producers in developing regions to gain access to developed markets".&lt;ref name="European Fair 1998 p.23 &amp; 25"&gt;European Fair Trade Association (1998). Fair Trade Yearbook: Towards 2000. p.23 &amp; 25&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative trading organizations have Fair Trade at the core of their mission and activities, using it as a development tool to support disadvantaged producers and to [[poverty reduction|reduce poverty]], and combine their marketing with awareness-raising and campaigning.

Alternative trading organizations are often, but not always, based in political and religious groups, though their secular purpose precludes sectarian identification and evangelical activity. Philosophically, the grassroots political-action agenda of these organizations associates them with progressive political causes active since the 1960s: foremost, a belief in [[collective action]] and commitment to moral principles based on social, economic and [[trade justice]].

According to EFTA, the defining characteristic of alternative trading organizations is that of equal partnership and respect – partnership between the developing region producers and importers, shops, labelling organizations, and consumers. Alternative trade "humanizes" the trade process – making the producer-consumer chain as short as possible so that consumers become aware of the culture, identity, and conditions in which producers live. All actors are committed to the principle of alternative trade, the need for advocacy in their working relations and the importance of awareness-raising and advocacy work.&lt;ref name="European Fair 1998 p.23 &amp; 25" /&gt; Examples of such organisations are Ten Thousand Villages, Greenheart Shop, [[Equal Exchange]] and SERRV International in the US and [[Equal Exchange Trading]], [[Traidcraft]], Oxfam Trading, [[Twin Trading]] and Alter Eco in Europe as well as Siem Fair Trade Fashion in Australia.

== Universities ==
The concept of a Fair Trade school or Fair Trade university emerged from the [[United Kingdom]], where the Fairtrade Foundation now maintains a list of colleges and schools that comply with the needed requirements to be labeled such a university. In order to be considered a Fair Trade University, a school or university must have established a Fairtrade School Steering Group. They must have a written and implemented a school-wide Fair Trade Policy. The school or university must be dedicated to selling and using Fair Trade products. They have to learn and educate about Fair Trade issues. Finally, the Fairtrade Foundation requires that schools promote Fair Trade not only within the school, but throughout the wider community.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A Fair Trade University is one that develops all aspects of Fair Trade practices in their coursework. In 2007, the Director of the Environmental Studies program at the [[University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh]], David Barnhill, started a push to become the first Fair Trade University. This push received positive reactions from faculty and students. To begin the process, the University as a whole agreed that it would need support from four institutional groups—faculty, staff, support staff, and students—to maximize support and educational efforts. The University officially endorsed the Earth Charter and created a Campus Sustainability Plan to align with the efforts of becoming a Fair Trade University.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The University of Wisconsin- Oshkosh also offers many courses in many different disciplines that implement fair trade learning. They offer a business course with a trip to [[Peru]] to visit coffee farmers, an environmental science class that discusses fair trade as a way for cleaner food systems, an English course that focuses on the [[Earth Charter]] and the application of fair trade principles, and several upper-level anthropology courses make fair trade the center of the class.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sustainability in Higher Education|last = Feldman|first = James|publisher = The MIT Press|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0-262-01949-1|location = |pages = 241–248|last2 = Barnhill|jstor = j.ctt9qf6bw.26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 2010, the [[University of California, San Diego]] became the second Fair Trade University in the United States. The University of California at San Diego understood the efforts of the Fairtrade Foundation in the UK, but they recognized they wanted to be more detailed about how their declaration as a Fair Trade University would make an actual change in the way on-campus franchises do business with the university. They also required constant assessment and improvement. The main premise of being a Fair Trade University for the University of California at San Diego is the promise between the university and the students about the continual effort by the university to increase the accessibility of Fair Trade Certified food and drinks and to encourage sustainability in other ways, such as buying from local, organic farmers and decreasing waste.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Fair Trade Universities have been successful because they are a "feel good" movement. The movement also has an established history, making it a true movement rather just a fad. Thirdly, Fair Trade Universities are effective because they raise awareness about an issue and offer a solution. The solution is an easy one for college students to handle, just paying about five cents more for a cup of coffee or tea can make a real difference.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Worldshops ==
{{Main article|Worldshop}}
[[File:Oxfam shop on Drury Lane.jpg|thumb|[[Oxfam#Shops|Oxfam shop]] on [[Drury Lane]] in [[Covent Garden]], [[London]]]]
Worldshops or fair trade shops are specialized retail outlets offering and promoting fair trade products. Worldshops also typically organize various educational fair trade activities and play an active role in trade justice and other North-South political campaigns. Worldshops are often [[not-for-profit]] organizations and run by locally based volunteer networks. Although the movement emerged in Europe and a vast majority of worldshops are still based on the continent, worldshops can also be found today in North America, Australia and New Zealand.

Worldshops' aim is to make trade as direct and fair with the trading partners as possible. Usually, this means a producer in a [[developing country]] and consumers in [[industrialisation|industrialized]] countries. The worldshops' target is to pay the producers a fair price that guarantees substinence and guarantees positive social development. They often cut out any intermediaries in the import chain. A web movement has begun in the 2000s to provide fair trade items at fair prices to the consumers. One popular one is Fair Trade a Day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairtradeaday.com/|title=fairtradeday.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a different fair trade item is featured each day.

Every year the sales of Fair Trade products grow close to 30% and in 2004 were worth over $500 million USD. In the case of coffee, sales grow nearly 50% per year in certain countries.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2004"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Raynolds | first1 = Laura T | first2 = Douglas | last2 = Murray | first3 = Peter Leigh | last3 = Taylor | title = Fair Trade Coffee: Building Producers Capacity Via Global Networks | journal = Journal of International Development | year = 2004 | pages = 1109–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, 16,000 tons of Fairtrade coffee was purchased by consumers in 17 countries.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2004" /&gt; "Fair trade coffee is currently produced in 24 countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia".&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2004" /&gt; The 165 FLO associations in Latin America and Caribbean are located in 14 countries and together export over 85% of the world's Fair Trade coffee.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2004" /&gt; There is a North/South divide of fair trade products with producers in the South and consumers in the North.

=== Africa ===
Africa's exports come from the places such as South Africa, Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya. These exports are valued at $24 million USD.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2009"&gt;Raynolds, Laura T., and Siphelo Unathi Ngcwangu. "Fair Trade Rooibos Tea: Connecting South African Producers and American Consumer Markets." Geoforum (2009): 74-83. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Between the years of 2004 and 2006 Africa quickly expanded their number of FLO certified producer groups, rising from 78 to 171; nearly half of which reside in Kenya, following closely behind are Tanzania and South Africa.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2009" /&gt; The FLO products Africa is known for are tea, cocoa, flowers and wine.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2009" /&gt; In Africa there are smallholder cooperatives and plantations which produce Fair Trade certified tea.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura T. 2009" /&gt; Cocoa-producing countries in West Africa often form cooperatives that produce [[fair trade cocoa]] such as [[Kuapa Kokoo]] in [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; West African countries without strong fair trade industries are subject to deterioration in cocoa quality as they compete with other countries for a profit. These countries include [[Cameroon]], [[Nigeria]], and the [[Ivory Coast]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

=== Latin America ===
Studies in the early 2000s show that the income, education and health of coffee producers involved with Fair Trade in Latin America were improved, versus producers who were not participating.&lt;ref name="Geiger-Onteo, Stephanie 2011"&gt;Geiger-Onteo, Stephanie, and Eric J. Arnould. "Alternative Trade Organization and Subjective Quality of Life: The Case of Latin American Coffee Producers." Journal of Macromarketing (2011): 276-290. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil, Nicaragua, Peru and Guatemala, having the biggest population of coffee producers, make use of some of the most substantial land for coffee production in Latin America and do so by taking part in Fair Trade.&lt;ref name="Geiger-Onteo, Stephanie 2011" /&gt; Countries in Latin America are also large exporters of [[fair trade bananas]]. The [[Dominican Republic]] is the largest producer of fair trade bananas, followed by [[Mexico]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Costa Rica]]. Producers in the Dominican Republic have set up associations rather than cooperatives so that individual farmers can each own their own land but meet regularly.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Fundación Solidaridad was created in [[Chile]] to increase the earnings and social participation of handicraft producers. These goods are marketed locally in Chile and internationally.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; Fair trade handicraft and jewellery production has also shown a significant uplift over recent years, aided by North American and European online retailers developing direct relationships to import and sell the products online. The sale of fair trade handicrafts online has been of particular importance in aiding the development of female artisans in Latin America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mixyfandino.com/empowering-the-female-artisan/|title=mixyfandino.com/empowering-the-female-artisan/|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===
The Asia Fair Trade Forum aims to increase the competency of fair trade organizations in Asia so they can be more competitive in the global market. Garment factories in Asian countries including [[China]], [[Burma]], and [[Bangladesh]] consistently receive charges of human rights violations, including the use of child labour.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; These violations conflict with the principles outlined by fair trade certifiers. In [[India]], Trade Alternative Reform Action (Tara) Projects formed in the 1970s have worked to increase production capacity, quality standards, and entrance into markets for home-based craftsmen that were previously unattainable due to their lower caste identity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

=== Australia ===
The Fair Trade Association of Australia and New Zealand (FTAANZ) is a member-based organization that supports two systems of fair trade. The first is the Australia and New Zealand member of FLO International, which unites Fairtrade producer and labelling initiatives across Europe, Asia, Latin America, North America, Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The second, is the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO), of over 450 worldwide members, to which FTAANZ is one. Fairtrade (one word) refers to FLO certified commodity and associated products. Fair trade (two words) encompasses the wider Fair Trade movement, including the Fairtrade commodities and other artisan craft products.

==Commodities ==
Fair trade commodities are goods that have been exchanged from where they were grown or made to where they are purchased, and have been certified by a fair trade certification organization, such as [[Fair Trade USA]] or [[World Fair Trade Organization]]. Such organizations are typically overseen by Fairtrade International. Fairtrade International sets international fair trade standards and supports fair trade producers and cooperatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/about_us.html |title=Fairtrade International (FLO): Fairtrade International |publisher=Fairtrade.net |date=2017-09-17 |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty percent of the fair trade market revolves around food products such as coffee, tea, cocoa, honey, and bananas.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura 2000"&gt;Raynolds, Laura. "Re-embedding Global Agriculture: The International Organic and Fair Trade Movements." Agriculture and Human Values 17.3 (2000): 297-309. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-food commodities include crafts, textiles, and flowers. It has been suggested by Shima Baradaran of Brigham Young University that fair trade techniques could be productively applied to products which might involve [[child labor]].&lt;ref name="Fair Trade and Child Labor"&gt;{{cite journal|first2=Stephanie H. |last2=Barclay|title=Fair Trade and Child Labor|journal=Columbia Human Rights Law Review, Forthcoming|date=April 26, 2011|ssrn=1823546|accessdate=|author=Shima Baradaran|quote=fair trade should be considered as a proven alternative to current strategies to eliminate child labor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although fair trade represents only .01% of the food and beverage industry in the United States, it is growing rapidly and may become a significant portion of the national food and beverage industry.&lt;ref&gt;Raynolds, Laura T., Douglas L. Murray, and John Wilkinson. Fair Trade: The Challenges of Transforming Globalization. London: Routledge, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coffee ===
{{Main article|Fair trade coffee}}
[[File:Coffee beans being sorted and pulped.jpg|thumb|Fair trade [[coffee bean]]s being sorted]]
Coffee is the most well-established fair trade commodity. Most Fair Trade coffee is ''[[Coffea arabica]],'' a type of coffee known to be grown at high altitudes. A lot of emphasis is put on the quality of the coffee when dealing in Fair Trade markets because Fair Trade markets are usually specialized markets that appeal to customers who are motivated by taste rather than price. The Fair Trade movement fixated on coffee first because it is a highly traded commodity for most producing countries and almost half the world's coffee is produced by smallholder farmers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While initially sold at small scale, currently multinationals like Starbucks and Nestlé use fair trade coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Weak Coffee: Certification and Co-Optation in the Fair Trade Movement|url = http://socpro.oxfordjournals.org/content/59/1/94|journal = Social Problems|date = 2012-02-01|issn = 0037-7791|pages = 94–116|volume = 59|issue = 1|doi = 10.1525/sp.2012.59.1.94|first = Daniel|last = Jaffee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally recognized Fair Trade coffee standards have been outlined by FLO and are as follows: small producers are grouped in democratic cooperatives or groups, buyers and sellers establish long-term, stable relationships, buyers must pay the producers at least the minimum Fair Trade price or when the market price is higher, they must pay the market price, and finally, buyers must also pay a social premium of 20 cents per pound of coffee to the producers. The current minimum Fair Trade price for high-grade, washed Arabica coffee $1.40 per pound; the price increases to $1.70 per pound if the coffee is also organic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Locations ====
The largest sources of fair trade coffee are Uganda and Tanzania, followed by Latin American countries such as Guatemala and Costa Rica.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura 2000" /&gt; As of 1999, major importers of fair trade coffee included Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. There is a North/South divide between fair trade consumers and producers. North American countries are not yet among the top importers of fair trade coffee.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura 2000" /&gt;

==== Labour ====
Starbucks began to purchase more fair trade coffee in 2001 because of charges of labor rights violations in Central American plantations. Several competitors, including Nestlé, followed suit.&lt;ref name="Jaffee, Daniel 2012 pp. 94-116"&gt;Jaffee, Daniel: "Weak Coffee: Certification and Co-Optation in the Fair Trade Movement." Social Problems, Vol. 59, No. 1 (February 2012), pp. 94-116&lt;/ref&gt; Large corporations that sell non-fair trade coffee take 55% of what consumers pay for coffee while only 10% goes to the producers. Small growers dominate the production of coffee, especially in Latin American countries such as Peru. Coffee is the fastest expanding fairly traded commodity, and an increasing number of producers are small farmers that own their own land and work in cooperatives. Even the incomes of growers of fair trade coffee beans depend on the market value of coffee where it is consumed, so farmers of fair trade coffee do not necessarily live above the poverty line or get completely fair prices for their commodity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ransom, David. The No-nonsense Guide to Fair Trade. Oxford: New Internationalist Publications, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Unsustainable farming practices can harm plantation owners and laborers. Unsustainable practices such as using chemicals and unshaded growing are risky. Small growers who put themselves at economic risk by not having diverse farming practices could lose money and resources due to fluctuating coffee prices, pest problems, or policy shifts.&lt;ref name="Rice, Robert A 1999"&gt;Rice, Robert A (1999). "A Place Unbecoming: The Coffee Farm of Northern Latin America." Geographical Review: 89(4): 554-579.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of Fairtrade is questionable; workers on Fairtrade farms have a lower standard of living than on similar farms outside the Fairtrade system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2014/05/agriculture-ethiopia-and-uganda?fsrc=scn/fb/wl/bl/notsofairtrade|accessdate=3 July 2014|title=Agriculture in Ethiopia and Uganda: Not so fair trade|work=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sustainability ====
As coffee becomes one of the most important export crops in certain regions such as northern Latin America, nature and agriculture are transformed. Increased productivity requires technological innovations, and the coffee agroecosystem has been changing rapidly. In the nineteenth century in Latin America, coffee plantations slowly began replacing sugarcane and subsistence crops. Coffee crops became more managed; they were put into rows and unshaded, meaning diversity of the forest was decreased and [[Coffea]] trees were shorter. As plant and tree diversity decreased, so did animal diversity. Unshaded plantations allow for a higher density of Coffea trees, but negative effects include less protection from wind and more easily eroded soil. Technified coffee plantations also use chemicals such as fertilizers, insecticides, and fungicides.&lt;ref name="Rice, Robert A 1999" /&gt;

Fair trade certified commodities must adhere to sustainable agro-ecological practices, including reduction of chemical fertilizer use, prevention of erosion, and protection of forests. Coffee plantations are more likely to be fair trade certified if they use traditional farming practices with shading and without chemicals. This protects the biodiversity of the ecosystem and ensures that the land will be usable for farming in the future and not just for short-term planting.&lt;ref name="Raynolds, Laura 2000" /&gt; In the United States, 85% of fair trade certified coffee is also organic.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;DeCarlo, Jacqueline. Fair Trade: A Beginner's Guide. Oxford, England: Oneworld, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Consumer attitudes ====
Consumers typically have positive attitudes for products that are ethically made. These products may include promises of fair labor conditions, protection of the environment, and protection of human rights. All fair trade products must meet standards such as these. Despite positive attitudes toward ethical products including fair trade commodities, consumers often are not willing to pay the higher price associated with fair trade coffee. The attitude-behavior gap can help explain why ethical and fair trade products take up less than 1% of the market. Coffee consumers can say they would be willing to pay a higher premium for fair trade coffee, but most consumers are actually more concerned with the brand, label, and flavor of the coffee. However, socially conscious consumers with a commitment to buying fair trade products are more likely to pay the premium associated with fair trade coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pelsmacker | first1 = De | last2 = Patrick | first2 = | last3 = Driesen | first3 = Liesbeth | last4 = Rayp | first4 = Glenn | year = 2005| title = Do Consumers Care about Ethics?

[[Safeway Inc.]] began carrying fair trade coffee after individual consumers dropped off postcards asking for it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Jaffee, Daniel.

=== Cocoa ===
Many countries that export [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] rely on cocoa as their single export crop. In Africa in particular, governments tax cocoa as their main source of revenue. Cocoa is a permanent crop, which means that it occupies land for long periods of time and does not need to be replanted after each harvest.&lt;ref name="Willer and Yussefi 2008"&gt;Willer, Helga; Yussefi-Menzler, Minou und Sorensen, Neil, (Hrsg.) (2008) "The World of Organic Agriculture – Statistics and Emerging Trends 2008." IFOAM, Bonn and FiBL, Frick&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Locations ====
Cocoa is farmed in the tropical regions of West Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. In Latin America, cocoa is produced in Costa Rica, Panama, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil. Much of the cocoa produced in Latin America is an organic and regulated by an [[Internal control]] system. Bolivia has fair trade cooperatives that permit a fair share of money for cocoa producers. African cocoa-producing countries include Cameroon, Madagascar, São Tomé and Príncipe, Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, and Côte d'Ivoire.&lt;ref name="Willer and Yussefi 2008" /&gt; Côte d'Ivoire exports over a third of the world's cocoa beans.&lt;ref name="Brown, Michael Barratt 2007"&gt;Brown, Michael Barratt. "'Fair Trade' with Africa." Review of African Political Economy 34.112 (2007): 267-77&lt;/ref&gt; Southeast Asia accounts for about 14% of the world's cocoa production. Major cocoa-producing countries are Indonesia, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldcocoafoundation.org/our-work/where-we-work/ |title=Where We Work |publisher=World Cocoa Foundation |date= |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Labour ====
One suggestion for the reason that laborers in Africa are marginalized in world trade is because the colonial division of labor kept Africa from developing its own industries. Africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa, which caused poverty to abound. Fair trade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system.&lt;ref name="Brown, Michael Barratt 2007" /&gt; Most cocoa comes from small family-run farms in West Africa. These farms have little market access and thus rely on middlemen to bring their products to market. Sometimes middlemen are unfair to farmers. Farmers do not get a fair price for their product despite relying on cocoa sales for the majority of their income.&lt;ref name="Houston, Holly 2012"&gt;Houston, Holly, and Terry Wyer. "Why Sustainable Cocoa Farming Matters for Rural Development." Center for Strategic and International Studies, 6 Sept. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; One solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an [[Agricultural cooperative]]. Cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food, clothes, and school fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goodman | first1 = Michael K | year = 2004 | title = Reading fairtrade: political ecological imaginary and the moral economy of fairtrade foods | url = | journal = Political Geography | volume = 23 | issue = 7| pages = 891–915 | doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2004.05.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price, but this does not mean that the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers. In reality, much of this money goes to community projects such as water wells rather than to individual farmers. Nevertheless, cooperatives such as fair trade-endorsed [[Kuapa Kokoo]] in Ghana are often the only Licensed Buying Companies that will give farmers a fair price and not cheat them or rig sales.&lt;ref name="Berlan, Amanda 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berlan | first1 = Amanda | year = 2008 | title = Making or Marketing a Difference? An Anthropological Examination of the Marketing of Fair Trade Cocoa from Ghana | url = | journal = Research in Economic Anthropology | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 171–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers in cooperatives are frequently their own bosses and get bonuses per bag of cocoa beans. These arrangements are not always assured and fair trade organizations can't always buy all of the cocoa available to them from cooperatives.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==== Marketing ====
The marketing of fair trade cocoa to European consumers often portrays the cocoa farmers as dependent on western purchases for their livelihood and well-being. Showing African cocoa producers in this way is problematic because it is reminiscent of the imperialistic view that Africans cannot live happily without the help of westerners. It puts the balance of power in favor of the consumers rather than the producers.&lt;ref name="Berlan, Amanda 2008" /&gt;

Consumers often aren't willing to pay the extra price for fair trade cocoa because they do not know what fair trade is. Activist groups are vital in educating consumers about the unethical aspects of unfair trade and promoting demand for fairly traded commodities. Activism and ethical consumption not only promote fair trade but also act against powerful corporations such as [[Mars, Incorporated]] that refuse to acknowledge the use of forced child labor in the harvesting of their cocoa.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

==== Sustainability ====
Smallholding farmers not only frequently lack access to markets, they lack access to resources that lead to sustainable cocoa farming practices. Lack of sustainability can be due to pests, diseases that attack cocoa trees, lack of farming supplies, and lack of knowledge about modern farming techniques.&lt;ref name="Houston, Holly 2012" /&gt; One issue pertaining to cocoa plantation sustainability is the amount of time it takes for a cocoa tree to produce pods. A solution to this is to change the type of cocoa tree being farmed. In Ghana, a hybrid cocoa tree yields two crops after three years rather than the typical one crop after five years.

==== Harkin-Engel Protocol ====
The [[Harkin-Engel Protocol]], also commonly known as the Cocoa Protocol, is an international agreement that was created to end some of the world's worst forms of child labor, as well as forced labor in the cocoa industry. It was first negotiated by Senator Tom Harkin and Representative Eliot Engel after watching a documentary that showed the cocoa industry's widespread issue of child slavery and trafficking. The parties involved agreed to a six-article plan:

# Public statement of the need for and terms of an action plan—The cocoa industry acknowledged the problem of forced child labor and will commit "significant resources" to address the problem.
# Formation of multi-sectoral advisory groups—By 1 October 2001, an advisory group will be formed to research labor practices. By 1 December 2001, industry will form an advisory group and formulate appropriate remedies to address the worst forms of child labor.
# Signed joint statement on child labor to be witnessed at the ILO—By 1 December 2001, a statement must be made recognizing the need to end the worst forms of child labor and identify developmental alternatives for the children removed from labor.

=== Textiles ===
Fair trade [[textile]]s are primarily made from fair trade cotton. By 2015, almost 75,000 cotton farmers in developing countries have obtained Fairtrade certification. The minimum price that Fair trade pays allows cotton farmers to sustain and improve their livelihoods.&lt;ref name="Farmers' self-determination"&gt;Singh Anup Kumar. in E+Z / D+C [http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/fairtrade-improving-cotton-farmers-lot-africa-and-india] February, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Fair trade textiles are frequently grouped with fair trade crafts and goods made by artisans in contrast to cocoa, coffee, sugar, tea, and honey, which are agricultural commodities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==== Locations ====
India, Pakistan and West Africa are the primary exporters of fair trade cotton, although many countries grow fair trade cotton.&lt;ref name="Bassett, Thomas J 2010"&gt;Bassett, Thomas J. "Slim pickings: Fairtrade cotton in West Africa." Geoforum, 2010. 41(1): 44-55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Littrell, M. A. 1998"&gt;Littrell, M. A., and M. A. Dickson. "Fair Trade Performance in a Competitive Market." Clothing and Textiles Research Journal 16.4 (1998): 176-89&lt;/ref&gt; Textiles and clothing are exported from Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==== Labour ====
Labour is different for textile production than for agricultural commodities because textile production takes place in a factory, not on a farm. Children provide a source of cheap labor, and [[child labor]] is prevalent in Pakistan, India, and Nepal. Fair trade cooperatives ensure fair and safe labor practices, including disallowing child labor.&lt;ref name="Grimes, Kimberly M. 2000"&gt;Grimes, Kimberly M., and B. Lynne Milgram. Artisans and Cooperatives: Developing Alternative Trade for the Global Economy. Tucson: University of Arizona, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Fair trade textile producers are most often women in developing countries. They struggle with meeting the consumer tastes in North America and Europe. In Nepal, textiles were originally made for household and local use. In the 1990s, women began joining cooperatives and exporting their crafts for profit. Now handicrafts are Nepal's largest export. It is often difficult for women to balance textile production, domestic responsibilities, and agricultural work. Cooperatives foster the growth of democratic communities in which women have a voice despite being historically in underprivileged positions.&lt;ref name="Grimes, Kimberly M. 2000" /&gt; For fair trade textiles and other crafts to be successful in western markets, [[World Fair Trade Organization]]s require a flexible workforce of artisans in need of stable income, links from consumers to artisans, and a market for quality ethnic products.&lt;ref name="Littrell, M. A. 1998" /&gt;

However, making cotton and textiles fair trade does not always benefit laborers. Burkina Faso and Mali export the largest amount of cotton in Africa. Although many cotton plantations in these countries attained fair trade certification in the 1990s, participation in fair trade further ingrains existing power relations and inequalities that cause poverty in Africa rather than challenging them. Fair trade does not do much for farmers when it does not challenge the system that marginalizes producers. Despite not empowering farmers, the change to fair trade cotton has positive effects including female participation in cultivation.&lt;ref name="Bassett, Thomas J 2010" /&gt;

Textiles and garments are intricate and require one individual operator, in contrast to the collective farming of coffee and cocoa beans. Textiles are not a straightforward commodity because to be fairly traded, there must be regulation in cotton cultivation, dyeing, stitching, and every other step in the process of textile production.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Fair trade textiles must not be confused with the sweat-free movement although the two movements intersect at the worker level.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

Forced or unfair labor in textile production is not limited to developing countries. Charges of use of [[sweatshop]] labor are endemic in the United States. Immigrant women work long hours and receive less than minimum wage. In the United States, there is more of a stigma against child labor than forced labor in general. Consumers in the United States are willing to suspend the importation of textiles made with child labor in other countries but do not expect their exports to be suspended by other countries, even when produced using [[forced labor]].&lt;ref&gt;Bhagwati, Jagdish.

=== Seafood ===
With increasing media scrutiny of the conditions of fishermen, particularly Southeast Asia, the lack of transparency and traceability in the [[seafood]] industry prompted new efforts. In 2014, [[Fair Trade USA]] created its Capture Fisheries Program that led to the first instance of Fair Trade fish being sold globally in 2015. The program "requires fishermen to source and trade according to standards that protect fundamental human rights, prevent forced and child labor, establish safe working conditions, regulate work hours and benefits, and enable responsible resource management." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Responsibility in the Global Seafood Industry|url=https://www.fishwise.org/images/white_papers/Social_Responsibility_in_the_Global_Seafood_Industry.pdf|website=FishWise|publisher=FishWise|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Large companies and commodities ===
Large transnational companies have begun to use fair trade commodities in their products. In April 2000, [[Starbucks]] began offering fair trade coffee in all of their stores. In 2005, the company promised to purchase ten million pounds of fair trade coffee over the next 18 months. This would account for a quarter of the fair trade coffee purchases in the United States and 3% of Starbucks' total coffee purchases.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; The company maintains that increasing its fair trade purchases would require an unprofitable reconstruction of the supply chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Macdonald | first1 = Kate | year = 2007 | title = Globalising Justice within Coffee Supply Chains? Fair Trade, Starbucks and the Transformation of Supply Chain Governance | url = | journal = Third World Quarterly | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 793–812 | doi=10.1080/01436590701336663}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fair trade activists have made gains with other companies: [[Sara Lee Corporation]] in 2002 and [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] (the maker of [[Folgers]]) in 2003 agreed to begin selling a small amount of fair trade coffee. [[Nestlé]], the world's biggest coffee trader, began selling a blend of fair trade coffee in 2005.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; In 2006, [[The Hershey Company]] acquired [[Dagoba Chocolate|Dagoba]], an organic and fair trade chocolate brand.

Much contention surrounds the issue of fair trade products becoming a part of large companies. Starbucks is still only 3% fair trade – enough to appease consumers, but not enough to make a real difference to small farmers, according to some activists. The ethics of buying fair trade from a company that is not committed to the cause are questionable; these products are only making a small dent in a big company even though these companies' products account for a significant portion of global fair trade.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

=== Luxury commodities ===

There have been efforts to introduce fair trade practices to the [[luxury goods]] industry, particularly for gold and diamonds.

==== Diamonds and sourcing ====

In parallel to efforts to commoditize diamonds, some industry players have launched campaigns to introduce benefits to mining centers in the developing world. Rapaport Fair Trade was established with the goal "to provide ethical education for jewelry suppliers, buyers, first time or seasoned diamond buyers, social activists, students, and anyone interested in jewelry, trends, and ethical luxury."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rapaportfairtrade.com/What-is-RapFT/About.aspx |title=About Us |publisher=Rapaport Fair Trade |accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's founder, [[Martin Rapaport]], as well as [[Kimberley Process]] initiators Ian Smillie and [[Global Witness]], are among several industry insiders and observers who have called for greater checks and certification programs among many other programs that would ensure protection for miners and producers in developing countries. Smillie and Global Witness have since withdrawn support for the Kimberley Process. Other concerns in the diamond industry include working conditions in diamond cutting centers as well as the use of child labor. Both of these concerns come up when considering issues in Surat, India.&lt;ref&gt;[https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/01/02/rough_cut Rough Cut] Foreign Policy, 2 Jan 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gold ====
Brilliant Earth has committed itself to using fair-trade-certified gold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/style/article/Couple-s-ringing-endorsement-of-ethical-jewelry-3217614.php Couple's ringing endorsement of ethical jewelry] SFGate&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, the United Kingdom's Fairtrade Foundation became the first NGO to begin certifying gold under the fair trade rubric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shapingsustainablemarkets.iied.org/fairtrade-gold |title=Fairtrade Gold &amp;#124; Shaping Sustainable Markets |publisher=Shapingsustainablemarkets.iied.org |date= |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pornography or Sex industry ===
The concept of fair trade also influence the [[porn]] industry. Feminist columnists in several publication have written articles toward a pornography industry with mutual consent and no exploiting labor condition to actors and actresses. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/life/ethical-porn-474913&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dailydot.com/irl/ethical-porn/&lt;/ref&gt; There are also academic discourse about these facets. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1080/23268743.2014.888251|title = Fair-trade porn + niche markets + feminist audience|journal = Porn Studies|volume = 1|pages = 189–192|year = 2014|last1 = Mondin|first1 = Alessandra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1177/0966735010384332|title = Fair Trade Sex: Reflections on God, Sex, and Economics|journal = Feminist Theology|volume = 19|issue = 2|pages = 194–207|year = 2010|last1 = Cooper|first1 = Thia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union ===
[[File:Faitrade display.jpg|thumb|Display of Fairtrade products at the [[Derbyshire County Council]] head office]]
In 1994, the [[European Commission]] prepared the "Memo on alternative trade" in which it declared its support for strengthening Fair Trade in the South and North and its intention to establish an EC Working Group on Fair Trade. Furthermore, the same year, the [[European Parliament]] adopted the "Resolution on promoting fairness and solidarity in North South trade" (OJ C 44, 14 February 1994), a resolution voicing its support for fair trade. In 1996, the [[Economic and Social Committee]] adopted an "Opinion on the European 'Fair Trade' marking movement". A year later, in 1997, the document was followed by a resolution adopted by the European Parliament, calling on the [[European Commission]] to support Fair Trade banana operators. The same year, the European Commission published a survey on "Attitudes of EU consumers to Fair Trade bananas", concluding that Fair Trade bananas would be commercially viable in several EU Member States.&lt;ref name="FINE2006"&gt;FINE (2006). Business Unusual. Brussels: Fair Trade Advocacy Office&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the European Parliament adopted the "Resolution on Fair Trade" (OJ C 226/73, 20 July 1998), which was followed by the Commission in 1999 that adopted the "Communication from the Commission to the Council on 'Fair Trade'" COM(1999) 619 final, 29 November 1999. In 2000, public institutions in Europe started purchasing Fairtrade Certified coffee and tea. Furthermore, that year, the [[Cotonou Agreement]] made specific reference to the promotion of Fair Trade in article 23(g) and in the Compendium. The [[European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/36/EC]] also suggested promoting Fair Trade.&lt;ref name="FINE2006" /&gt; In 2001 and 2002, several other EU papers explicitly mentioned fair trade, most notably the 2001 Green Paper on [[Corporate Social Responsibility]] and the 2002 Communication on Trade and Development.

In 2004, the [[European Union]] adopted the "Agricultural Commodity Chains, Dependence and Poverty – A proposal for an EU Action Plan", with a specific reference to the Fair Trade movement which has "been setting the trend for a more socio-economically responsible trade." (COM(2004)0089). In 2005, in the European Commission communication "Policy Coherence for Development – Accelerating progress towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals", (COM(2005) 134 final, 12 April 2005), fair trade is mentioned as "a tool for poverty reduction and sustainable development".&lt;ref name="FINE2006" /&gt;

On July 6, 2006, the European Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution on fair trade, recognizing the benefits achieved by the Fair Trade movement, suggesting the development of an EU-wide policy on Fair Trade, defining criteria that need to be fulfilled under fair trade to protect it from abuse and calling for greater support to Fair Trade (EP resolution "Fair Trade and development", 6 July 2006). "This resolution responds to the impressive growth of Fair Trade, showing the increasing interest of European consumers in responsible purchasing," said [[European Green Party|Green]] MEP [[Frithjof Schmidt]] during the plenary debate. [[Peter Mandelson]], EU Commissioner for External Trade, responded that the resolution will be well received at the [[European Commission]]. "Fair Trade makes the consumers think and therefore it is even more valuable. We need to develop a coherent policy framework and this resolution will help us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade-advocacy.org/ftao-publications/press-releases/press-release-2006/157-european-parliament-supports-fair-trade|title=European Parliament supports Fair Trade|website=www.fairtrade-advocacy.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
In 2005, French [[French National Assembly|parliament]] member [[Antoine Herth]] issued the report "40 proposals to sustain the development of Fair Trade". The report was followed the same year by a law, proposing to establish a commission to recognize fair trade Organisations (article 60 of law no. 2005-882, Small and Medium Enterprises, 2 August 2005).&lt;ref name="FINE2006" /&gt; In parallel to the legislativents, also in 2006, the French chapter of [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] (AFNOR) adopted a reference document on Fair Trade after five years of discussion.

=== Italy ===
In 2006, Italian lawmakers started debating how to introduce a law on fair trade in [[Parliament of Italy|Parliament]]. A consultation process involving a wide range of stakeholders was launched in early October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vita.it/articolo/index.php3?NEWSID=72176 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312214105/http://www.vita.it/articolo/index.php3?NEWSID=72176 |archivedate=2007-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common definition of fair trade was most notably developed. However, its adoption is still pending as the efforts were stalled by the [[2008 Italian political crisis]].

=== Netherlands ===
The Dutch province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] was sued in 2007 by coffee supplier [[Douwe Egberts]] for explicitly requiring its coffee suppliers to meet fair trade criteria, most notably the payment of a minimum price and a development premium to producer cooperatives. Douwe Egberts, which sells a number of coffee brands under self-developed ethical criteria, believed the requirements were discriminatory. After several months of discussions and legal challenges, the province of Groningen prevailed in a well-publicized judgement. Coen de Ruiter, director of the Max Havelaar Foundation, called the victory a landmark event: "it provides governmental institutions the freedom in their purchasing policy to require suppliers to provide coffee that bears the fair trade criteria, so that a substantial and meaningful contribution is made in the fight against poverty through the daily cup of coffee".&lt;ref&gt;Max Havelaar Foundation (2007). [85.82.218.199/fileadmin/Bruger_filer/Dokument_database/IKAvaerktoej/EU_siden/Max_Havalaar.pdf Dutch Province of Groningen wins summary brought by Doug Egberts and can continue specifying fair trade coffee]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{Main article|Fair trade debate}}
{{Criticism section|date=February 2013}}
While there have been studies claiming fair trade as beneficial and efficient,&lt;ref name="Bacon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bacon|first=Christopher|title=Confronting the Coffee Crisis: Can Fair Trade, Organic, and Specialty Coffees Reduce Small-Scale Farmer Vulnerability in Northern Nicaragua?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X04002062|accessdate=31 December 2012|doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2004.10.002|volume=33|issue=3|journal=World Development|pages=497–511|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; other studies have been less favourable; showing limitations to fair trade benefits. Sometimes the criticism is intrinsic to fair trade, sometimes efficiency depends on the broader context such as the lack of government help or volatile prices in the global market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Utting-chamorro|first=Karla|title=Does fair trade make a difference?

=== Ethical basis===
Studies have shown a significant number of consumers were content to pay higher prices for fair trade products, in the belief that this helps the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchising.com/news/20080612_costa_coffee_hosts_national_foundation_day_to_enco.html |title=Costa Coffee Hosts National 'Foundation Day' To Encourage Ethical Coffee Consumption |publisher=Franchising.com |date=2008-06-12 |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Niemi|first= N. |year=2010|title=Empowering Coffee Traders?

Furthermore, research has cited the implementation of certain Fairtrade standards as a cause for greater inequalities in markets where these rigid rules are inappropriate for the specific market.&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections" /&gt;{{Self-published source|date=March 2015}}&lt;ref name="Booth, P 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doppler, F. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Philip "Don't bully the faithful into buying Fairtrade", The Catholic Herald, 20 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perso2010"/&gt;

=== What occurs with the money? ===

==== Little money may reach the developing countries ====
The Fairtrade Foundation does not monitor how much extra retailers charge for fair trade goods, so it is rarely possible to determine how much extra is charged or how much reaches the producers, in spite of l unfair trading legislation. In four cases it has been possible to find out. One British café chain was passing on less than one percent of the extra charged to the exporting cooperative;&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections" /&gt; in Finland, Valkila, Haaparanta and Niemi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Valkila | first1 = J. | last2 = Haaparanta | first2 = P. | last3 = Niemi | first3 = N. | year = 2010 | title = Empowering Coffee Traders?

==== Less money reaches farmers ====
The Fairtrade Foundation does not monitor how much of the extra money paid to the exporting cooperatives reaches the farmer. The cooperatives incur costs in reaching fair trade political standards, and these are incurred on all production, even if only a small amount is sold at fair trade prices. The most successful cooperatives appear to spend a third of the extra price received on this: some less successful cooperatives spend more than they gain. While this appears to be agreed by proponents and critics of fair trade,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Utting-Chamorro, K (2005). Does Fairtrade make a difference? The case of small coffee producers in Nicaragua. Development in Practice, Volume 15, Numbers 3 and 4, June 2005, Berndt, C.E. (2007). Is Fair Trade in coffee production fair and useful? Evidence from Costa Rica and Guatemala and implications for policy. Washington DC.: Mercatus 65 Policy Series, Policy Comment 11, Mercatus Centre, George Mason University.&lt;/ref&gt; there is a dearth of economic studies setting out the actual revenues and what the money was spent on. FLO figures&lt;ref name="Labelling"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International |title=Annual Report 2009–2010 |year= 2010 |accessdate=May 27, 2011 |url= http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/resources/FLO_Annual-Report-2009_komplett_double_web.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; are that 40% of the money reaching the [[developing world]] is spent on 'business and production' which would include these costs, as well as costs incurred by any inefficiency and corruption in the cooperative or the marketing system. The rest is stated to be spent on social projects, rather than being passed on to farmers.

Anecdotes state that farmers were paid more or less by traders than by fair trade cooperatives. Few of these anecdotes address the problems of price reporting in developing world markets,&lt;ref&gt;See Bowbrick, P, "Are price reporting systems of any use?", British Food Journal. 90(2) 65–69 March/April. 1988. Current international research on developing world market information systems is given at [http://www.sim2g.org/ sim2.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and few appreciate the complexity of the different price packages which may or may not include credit, harvesting, transport, processing, etc. Cooperatives typically average prices over the year, so they pay less than traders at some times, more at others. Bassett (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Bassett, T. (2009). Slim pickings: Fairtrade cotton in West Africa. Geoforum.&lt;/ref&gt; is able to compare prices only where Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade farmers have to sell cotton to the same monopsonistic ginneries which pay low prices. Prices would have to be higher to compensate farmers for the increased costs they incur to produce fair trade. For instance, fair trade encouraged Nicaraguan farmers to switch to organic coffee, which resulted in a higher price per pound, but a lower net income because of higher costs and lower yields.&lt;ref&gt;Kilian, B., Jones, C., Pratt, L., &amp; Villalobos, A. (2006). "Is Sustainable Agriculture a Viable Strategy to Improve Farm Income in Central America? A Case Study on Coffee". ''Journal of Business Research'' 59(3), 322–330.; Valkila, J. (2009). Fair Trade organic coffee production in Nicaragua – Sustainable development or a poverty trap? ''Ecological Economics'' 68 3018–25; Wilson, B. R. (2009). Indebted to Fair Trade? Coffee and Crisis in Nicaragua. Geoforum.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Effects of low barriers to entry ====
A 2015 study concluded that the low barriers to entry in a competitive market such as coffee undermines any effort to give higher benefits to producers through fair trade. They used data from Central America, to establish that the producer benefits were close to zero. This is because there is an oversupply of certification, and only a fraction of produce classified as fair trade is actually sold on fair trade markets, just enough to recoup the costs of certification.&lt;ref name="mitpressjournals.org"/&gt;

=== Inefficient marketing system ===
One reason for high prices is that fair trade farmers have to sell through a [[monopsonist]] cooperative, which may be inefficient or corrupt – certainly some private traders are more efficient than some cooperatives. They cannot choose the buyer who offers the best price, or switch when their cooperative is going bankrupt&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza, R., &amp; J. Bastiaensen, J. (2003). Fair Trade and the Coffee Crisis in the Nicaraguan Segovias. Small Enterprise Development, 14(2), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; if they wish to retain fairtrade status. There are also complaints that Fairtrade deviates from the free market ideal of some economists. [[Brink Lindsey]] calls fair trade a "misguided attempt to make up for market failures" encouraging market inefficiencies and overproduction.&lt;ref name="Brink"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adamsmith.org/pdf/groundsforcomplaint.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517134810/http://www.adamsmith.org/pdf/groundsforcomplaint.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fair trade harms other farmers ===

==== Overproduction argument ====
Critics argue that fair trade harms all non-Fairtrade farmers. Fair trade claims that its farmers are paid higher prices and are given special advice on increasing yields and quality. Economists&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections" /&gt;{{Self-published source|date=March 2015}}&lt;ref name="Brink" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth, P. and L. Whetstone (2007) 'Half a Cheer for Fair Trade', Economic Affairs, 27, 2, 29–36; Sidwell, M. (2008) Unfair Trade, London: Adam Smith Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harford, T: "The Undercover Economist.", 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Markets, poverty, and Fair Trade | author = Sam Bowman | date = 11 March 2011 | url = http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/tax-and-economy/markets,-poverty,-and-fair-trade/ | publisher = [[Adam Smith Institute]] | accessdate = 2011-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{ cite journal | journal = The Economist | date = Dec 7, 2006 | url = http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8380592 | title = Voting with your trolley }}&lt;/ref&gt; state that, if this is indeed so, Fairtrade farmers will increase production. As the demand for coffee is highly elastic, a small increase in supply means a large fall in market price, so perhaps a million Fairtrade farmers get a higher price and 24 million others get a substantially lower price. Critics quote the example of farmers in Vietnam being paid over the world price in the 1980s, planting lots of coffee, then flooding the world market in the 1990s. The fair trade minimum price means that when the world market price collapses, it is the non-fair trade farmers, particularly the poorest, who have to cut down their coffee trees. This argument is supported by mainstream economists, not just free marketers.{{refneeded|date=October 2017}}

=== Other ethical issues ===

==== Secrecy ====
Under EU law ([[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive|Directive 2005/29/EC]] on Unfair Commercial Practices) the criminal offence of Unfair Trading is committed if (a) 'it contains false information and is therefore untruthful or in any way, including overall presentation, deceives or is likely to deceive the average consumer, even if the information is factually correct', (b) 'it omits material information that the average consumer needs ... and thereby causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise' or (c) 'fails to identify the commercial intent of the commercial practice ... [which] causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise.' [[Peter Griffiths (economist)| 	
Peter Griffiths]] (2011)&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections" /&gt; points to false claims that fair trade producers get higher prices, the almost universal failure to disclose the extra price charged for fair trade products, to disclose how much of this actually reaches the developing world, to disclose what this is spent on in the developing world, to disclose how much, if any, reaches farmers, and to disclose the harm that Fairtrade does to non-fair trade farmers. He also points to the failure to disclose when 'the primary commercial intent' is to make money for retailers and distributors in rich countries.

==== Unethical selling techniques ====
[[Philip Booth (economist)|Philip Booth]] says that the selling techniques used by some sellers and some supporters of fair trade are bullying, misleading, and unethical.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org.uk/record.jsp?type=book&amp;ID=437&lt;/ref&gt; There are problems with the use of boycott campaigns and other pressure to force sellers to stock a product they think ethically suspect. However, the opposite has been argued, that a more participatory and multi-stakeholder approach to auditing might improve the quality of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntd.co.uk/idsbookshop/details.asp?id=807 |title=IDS Bookshop – Item details |publisher=Ntd.co.uk |accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people argue that these practices are justifiable: that strategic use of labeling may help embarrass (or encourage) major suppliers into changing their practices. They may make transparent corporate vulnerabilities that activists can exploit. Or they may encourage ordinary people to get involved with broader projects of social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Julie Guthman | year = 2007 | journal = Antipode | title = The Polanyian Way? Voluntary Food Labels as Neoliberal Governance | volume = 39 | pages = 456–78 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8330.2007.00535.x | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Failure to monitor standards ===
There are complaints that the standards are inappropriate and may harm producers, sometimes making them work several months more for little return.&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections" /&gt;{{Self-published source|date=March 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Utting-Chamorro | first1 = K | year = 2005 | title = Does Fairtrade make a difference? The case of small coffee producers in Nicaragua | url = | journal = Development in Practice | volume = 15 | issue = 3, 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moberg M (2005). "Fairtrade and Eastern Caribbean Banana Farmers: Rhetoric and Reality in the Anti-Globalization Movement." Human Organization 64:4–16, Cited in Nelson and Pound (2009) p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="valkila2009" /&gt;

Adherence to fair trade standards by producers has been poor, and enforcement of standards by Fairtrade is weak. Notably by Christian Jacquiau&lt;ref name="Hamel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Fair_trade_firm_accused_of_foul_play.html?cid=5351232 |title=Fair trade firm accused of foul play I |publisher=Swissinfo.ch |date=2006-08-03 |accessdate=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Paola Ghillani, who spent four years as president of Fairtrade Labelling Organizations&lt;ref name="Hamel" /&gt; There are many complaints of poor enforcement problems: labourers on Fairtrade farms in Peru are paid less than the minimum wage;&lt;ref&gt;Weitzman, H. (2006, August 9). 'Fair' coffee workers paid below minimum wage. Financial Times; Weitzman, H. (2006, September 9). ''Ethical-coffee' workers paid below legal minimum. Financial Times.&lt;/ref&gt; some non-Fairtrade coffee is sold as Fairtrade&lt;ref&gt;Weitzman, H.: 2006, The bitter cost of 'Fair Trade' coffee. Financial Times, September 8.&lt;/ref&gt; 'the standards are not very strict in the case of seasonally hired labour in coffee production.'&lt;ref name="valkila2009" /&gt; 'some fair trade standards are not strictly enforced'&lt;ref name="Reed" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, G., Gibbon, J., &amp; Slack, R.: 2006, 'The mainstreaming of Fair Trade: a macromarketing perspective', Journal of Strategic Marketing, 14, 329–52.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a ''[[Financial Times]]'' journalist found that ten out of ten mills visited had sold uncertified coffee to co-operatives as certified. It reported that "The FT was also handed evidence of at least one coffee association that received an organic, Fair Trade or other certifications despite illegally growing some 20 per cent of its coffee in protected national forest land.&lt;ref name="ft.com"&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/d191adbc-3f4d-11db-a37c-0000779e2340.html | newspaper =FT | place = Americas | title = The bitter cost of 'fair trade' coffee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trade justice and fair trade ===
Segments of the [[trade justice]] movement have also criticized fair trade in the past years for allegedly focusing too much on individual small producer groups while stopping short of advocating immediate trade policy changes that would have a larger effect on disadvantaged producers' lives. French author and [[Radio France Internationale|RFI]] correspondent [[Jean-Pierre Boris]] championed this view in his 2005 book ''Commerce inéquitable''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Boris | first = Jean-Pierre | year = 2005 | title = Commerce inéquitable | publisher = Hachette Littératures | place = Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political objections ===
There have been largely political criticisms of fair trade from the left and the right. Some believe the fair trade system is not radical enough. French author Christian Jacquiau, in his book ''Les coulisses du commerce équitable'', calls for stricter fair trade standards and criticizes the fair trade movement for working within the current system (i.e., partnerships with mass retailers, [[multinational corporation]]s, etc.) rather than establishing a new fairer, fully autonomous (i.e. [[state monopoly|government monopoly]]) trading system. Jacquiau also supports significantly higher fair trade prices in order to maximize the effect, as most producers only sell a portion of their crop under fair trade terms.{{Sfn | Jacquiau | 2006}}{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}} It has been argued that the approach of the FairTrade system is too rooted in a Northern consumerist view of justice which Southern producers do not participate in setting. "A key issue is therefore to make explicit who possesses the power to define the terms of Fairtrade, that is who possesses the power to determine the need of an ethic in the first instance, and subsequently command a particular ethical vision as the truth."&lt;ref&gt;Catherine S. Dolan (2008), ''Research in Economic Anthropology'', "Arbitrating risk through moral values: the case of Kenyan fairtrade", volume 28, pp. 271–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''faluche''''' is a traditional [[cap]] worn by students in France. It is a black velvet [[beret]], decorated with colored ribbons and badges.

Several student groups wear the ''faluche'', especially ''[[bitard]]s'', ''[[basochar]]ds'', and ''[[faluchard]]s''. Previously, the ''faluche'' was associated almost exclusively with ''faluchards'', although other folklore exists concerning the ''faluche''.

== History ==

Following demonstrations in 1884, the student association ''[[Association générale des étudiants]]'' of Paris ("A") was formed. On June 12, 1888, the Parisian students were invited to celebrate the 800th anniversary at the [[University of Bologna]] in Italy. At the celebration, the French students reportedly felt somewhat drab in comparison to the other students.  The attire of the French delegation involved simply dark clothing brightened by one rosette in a buttonhole, and a ribbon in ''[[saltire]]'' with the colors of the town of Paris. Other European students, by contrast, had a wide variety of costumes and hairstyles: the Belgian students from secular schools had ''pennes'', and those from Catholic schools had ''callotes''; the Spaniards were bedecked with ribbons which proclaimed membership in specific universities; the Germans had their own caps; the Swiss had their thin ''[[kepi]]s'' with small visors; the Italians wore a [[Louis XI]]-style hat, and others.

The French students thus decided to create a specific style of cap for themselves. They chose the black velvet beret of the inhabitants of the [[Bologna]] area, in remembrance of the students' congress in Bologna, which they fondly remembered.

On June 25, 1888, the date of the French students' return to Paris, that the ''faluche'' was really launched. Its popularity spread at the 600th anniversary of the [[University of Montpellier]] which took place May 22&amp;ndash;25, 1890. From there, the tradition rapidly spread to other cities, with badges and ribbons added later.

The symbols used, initially transmitted orally, varied by university. This is why a synthesis was made in [[Lille]] on March 8, 1986, inspired by the [[Toulouse]] code. It was adopted as a national code in December 1986 in Toulouse, and it was at this time that the concept of ''Grand Master'' began. Then in 1988, at the time of the centenary of Faluche in [[Reims]], a new more complete code was published, taking into account the Montpellier characteristics.

At the time of the German occupation during World War II, the wearing of the ''faluche'' was forbidden, except for the day of [[Saint Nicholas]].

In 1988 the 100th anniversary of the ''faluche'' was celebrated in [[Reims]], which has continued annually, in a different city each year.

== A "regulated" cap ==

The colors and badges related to the ''faluche'' recall the life of the student. A written code makes it possible to ensure a homogeneity within the ''faluchard'' movement so that each student can read the ''faluche'' and thus know the course of each person.

=== Characteristics ===

* In [[Amiens]] and [[Reims]], the ribbons of city and areas are out of velvet, pointing out thus the tradition tisserande of these cities. Except the students in sciences which have their satin ribbons.
* In [[Bordeaux]], the currency is on the circular, under the nickname. The badges on the circular are embroidered.
* In [[Dijon]], the ribbons are out of velvet because it is the city which organized the States Généraux in 1989
* In [[Grenoble]], the initial ones are in embroidered letters, the leg of Grand Chambellan is cut at a peak, the pines chartreuse is located on the ribbon of town of study and there is no oath at the end of the baptism.
* In [[Nantes]] the personal and codes parts are reversed. A red pompom is drawn up at the top pointing out the origins of Nantes, harbor city. By extension this symbol is tolerated for any origin of a harbor city.
** The students into dental raise a ribbon of purple velvet circular with a red velvet edging which recalls their first year of medicine.
** The students in economic sciences have like emblem the mercury caduceus and the balance (they were accommodated by the Droit corporation after the room of association had burned).
*  To [[Lyon]], the military students of the health service of the armies, or standards, carry a third ribbon, blue-white-red, between the two other ribbons. In the middle of this tricolour ribbon the badge of the school of the health service of the armies of [[Lyon-Bron]] is. In pharmacy, always in Lyon, the single attribute of the Grand Maître is a sun carried to the frontal, with the top of the circular green.
* In [[Poitiers]], all the ribbons are braided. Moreover, the color of the circular Sage-femme is red velvet, identical to the Médecine circular but with the cross of Ankh. Moreover, the évèque of the south is named there.
* In [[Rouen]], there is a third cross, that of the GD (Grand Délateur) which has as a role to prepare and to manage the "sanctions" during the baptisms. The former engineers have as a circular, a large black ribbon with a blue edging in the medium. The medical students (who place their caduceus on velvet and not on the crculaire) reverse the personal and official sides of their faluche. The students of law do not carry the colors of the town of Rouen but those of Jeanne d' Arc and their ribbons are not out of velvet but out of satin, (to be noted that this tradition is erased little by little). It is finally one of the only harbour cities not to raise the pompom.
* In [[Toulon]] the faluche does not have a Grand Maitre nor of Grand Chambelan. It is assembled Resident of Toulon which decides on the jury and the officiants at the beginning of the baptism by vote.
* In [[Tours]] the code is strictly followed.
* In [[Valence, Drôme|Valence]] the color of a circular BTS is red, white, red. Moreover, the GM and GC are called Bitards Valentinois (in honor of Bitards Poitevins because the first GM Valentinois were established by our neighbors of Poitou-Charentes and the Center). There is a "braid of sponsorship" (with the colors of the town of birth and province of birth), it is offered by the godson to the godfather when he considers his work accomplished.

==== Local codes ====

The [[Alsace|Alsatian]] and [[Montpellier|Montpelliérains]] ''faluchards'' have a different code than that usually called national code;

* The Alsatian ''faluche'': in addition to differences in terms of colors of dies, badges and of provision of the ribbons, the Alsatian ''faluche'' is recognizable with the existence of velvet passers by on a flexible circumference (without reinforcement of leather or plastic), and of a mobile circular (which is not bent on the aforementioned circumference). The membership of the ''faluchard'' to the board of directors or the office of an association of die results in the presence of a "V" on the basis of the back of the ''faluche'' and pointing towards its center, with the colors of the die. In addition, there exists in its center neither ''Grand Maître'', neither ''Grand Chamberlans'', nor Bishops. A collegial assembly old ''faluchards'' (the TVA for ''Très Vénérables Anciens'', co-opted among old the ''faluchards'', which has more than two years of ''faluche''), all confused dies, have the role of being the guarantors of the local traditions ''faluchardes'' and of tallying the various ceremonies. They do not remain about it less ''faluchards'' like the others. Some ''faluchards'' (especially in medicine) carry the ribbon of the memory in memory of the left Alsatian students in [[Clermont-Ferrand]] during World War II.
* In Montpellier, the ''faluche'' is characterized by the presence from four burst with the colors from the studied principal discipline, thus forming four parts of black velvet equal. This tradition pays homage to [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]], who studied with the Faculty of Medicine of Montpellier to the 16th century.

==Organization==

The ''faluchards'' in the majority of the dies and for each city elect a ''Grand Maître'' (GM) appointed like guarantor of the traditions and supported by a ''Grand Chamberlan'' (GC) whom it chooses. Their badge is a registered cross of the expression to the merit, which they carry at the end of a ribbon of the color of their die. The cross of GM is enamelled of white and that of GC is gilded. In [[Valence, Drôme|Valence]] and ''Grenoble'', the GC has a ribbon points some without cross with the colors of their discipline.

There are also three bishops who "reign" in a part of France: They "reign" in the towns of [[Amiens]], [[Dijon]] and [[Poitiers]]. The bishop is recognized for his empathy and is charged to regulate the conflicts like celebrating the marriages ''faluchards''.

In [[Nice]] there are also 12 knights who carry a kilt, representing the various dies of ''faluchés'' the ''niçois'', charged with organizing the ''faluchages'' and to be the guards of the traditions. The GM and GC are selected among the knights. There is even a specific code for the knighthood falucharde niçoise.

There are also orders (which do not have anything official) within the ''faluche''. The membership of a brotherhood can be displayed on the ''faluche'' by a ribbon or a badge particular to each brotherhood.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7248">The '''fitness-density covariance''' is a [[coexistence theory|coexistence mechanism]] that can allow similar species to coexist because they are in different locations.&lt;ref name="Chesson2000space"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chesson|first1=Peter|title=General Theory of Competitive Coexistence in Spatially-Varying Environments|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=November 2000|volume=58|issue=3|pages=211–237|doi=10.1006/tpbi.2000.1486|pmid=11120650}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This effect will be the strongest if species are completely segregated, but can also work if their populations overlap somewhat.  If a fitness-density covariance is operating, then when a species becomes very rare, its population will shift to predominantly locations with favorable conditions (e.g., less competition or good [[habitat]]). Similarly, when a species becomes very common, then conditions will worsen where they are most common, and they will spread into areas where conditions are less favorable.  This negative feedback can help species avoid being driven extinct by competition, and it can prevent stronger species from becoming too common and crowding out other species.

Along with [[storage effect]]s and [[relative nonlinearity|relative nonlinearities]], fitness-density covariances make up the three variation-dependent mechanisms of [[coexistence theory|modern coexistence theory]].&lt;ref name="Chesson2000review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chesson|first1=Peter|title=Mechanisms of Maintenance of Species Diversity|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|date=November 2000|volume=31|issue=1|pages=343–366|doi=10.1146/Annurev.Ecolsys.31.1.343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical derivation==
Here, we will consider competition between ''n'' species.&lt;ref name="Chesson2000space" /&gt;  We will define ''N''&lt;sub&gt;xj&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') as the number of individuals of species ''j'' at patch ''x'' and time ''t'', and ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') the fitness (i.e., the per-capita contribution of individual to the next time period through survival and reproduction) of individuals of species ''j''s at patch ''x'' and time ''t''.&lt;ref name="Chesson2000space" /&gt;  ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''&lt;/sub&gt;(t) will be determined by many things, including [[habitat]], [[intraspecific competition]], and [[interspecific competition]] at ''x''.  Thus, if there are currently ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') individuals at ''x'', then they will contribute ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''(''t'')&lt;/sub&gt;''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') individuals to the next time period (i.e., ''t''+1).  Those individuals may stay at ''x'', or they may move; the net contribution of ''x'' to next year's population will be the same.

With our definitions in place, we want to calculate the finite rate of increase of species ''j'' (i.e., its population-wide growth rate), &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda}(t)&lt;/math&gt;.  It is defined such that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_j}(t) = \overline{N_j(t+1)}/ \overline{N_j(t)}&lt;/math&gt;, where each average is across all space.&lt;ref name="Chesson2000space" /&gt;  In essence, it is the average fitness of members of species ''j'' in year ''t''.  We can calculate ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''+1) by summing ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''(''t'')&lt;/sub&gt;''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') across all patches, giving
:&lt;math&gt; \tilde{\lambda}(t) = \frac{1}{X}\sum_X \frac{N_{xj}(t)\lambda_{xj}(t)}{\overline{N_j(t)}} , &lt;/math&gt;
where ''X'' is the number of patches.  Defining &lt;math&gt;\nu_{xj} = N_{xj}(t)/\overline{N_j(t)}&lt;/math&gt; as species ''j'''s relative density at ''x'', this equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_j}(t) = \frac{1}{X}\sum_X \nu_{xj}\lambda_{xj}(t) = \overline{\nu_{xj}\lambda_{xj}(t)}.&lt;/math&gt;
Using the theorem that &lt;math&gt;\overline{XY} = \overline{X}~\overline{Y} + \mbox{cov}(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt;, this simplifies to
:&lt;math&gt; \tilde{\lambda_j}(t) = \overline{\nu_{xj}}\overline{\lambda_{xj}(t)}+ \mbox{cov}(\nu_{xj}, \lambda_{xj}(t)).&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;\nu_{xj} = N_{xj}(t)/\overline{N_{xj}(t)}&lt;/math&gt;, its average will be 1.  Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_j}(t) = \overline{\lambda_{xj}(t)}+ \mbox{cov}(\nu_{xj}, \lambda_{xj}(t)).&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, we have partitioned &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_j}(t)&lt;/math&gt; into two key parts: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\lambda_{xj}(t)}&lt;/math&gt; calculates the fitness of an individual, on average in any given site.  Thus, if species are distributed uniformly across the landscape, &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_j}(t)=\overline{\lambda_{xj}(t)}&lt;/math&gt;. If, however, they are distributed non-randomly across the environment, then cov(''ν''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;xj&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')) will be non-zero.  If individuals are found predominantly in good sites, then cov(''ν''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;xj&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')) will be positive; if they are found predominantly in poor sites, then cov(''ν''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;xj&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')) will be negative.

To analyze how species coexist, we perform an [[invasion analysis]].&lt;ref name="Chesson2000review" /&gt;  In short, we remove one species (called the "invader") from the environment, and allow the other species (called the "residents") to come the equilibrium (so that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_r}(t) = 1&lt;/math&gt; for each resident).  We then determine if the invader has a positive growth rate.  If each species has a positive growth rate as an invader, then they can coexist.

Because &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_r}(t) = 1&lt;/math&gt; for each resident, we can calculate the invader's growth rate, &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_i}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, as
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_i}(t) = \tilde{\lambda_i}(t) - \frac{1}{n-1} \sum (\tilde{\lambda_r}(t) - 1),&lt;/math&gt;
where ''n''-1 is the number of residents (since ''n'' is the number of species), and the sum is over all residents (and thus represents an average).&lt;ref name="Chesson2000space" /&gt;  Using our formula for &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_j}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, we find that
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_i}(t) = [\overline{\lambda_{xi}(t)}+ \mbox{cov}(\nu_{xi}, \lambda_{xi}(t)) ] - \frac{1}{n-1} \sum [\overline{\lambda_{xr}(t)}+ \mbox{cov}(\nu_{xr}, \lambda_{xr}(t))- 1].&lt;/math&gt;
This rearranges to
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_i}(t) =1+ \left[ \overline{\lambda_{xi}(t)} -\frac{1}{n-1} \sum \overline{\lambda_{xr}(t)} \right]+ \Delta \kappa .&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \kappa = \mbox{cov}(\nu_{xi}, \lambda_{xi}(t)) - \frac{1}{n-1} \sum \mbox{cov}(\nu_{xr}, \lambda_{xr}(t))&lt;/math&gt;
is the fitness-density covariance, and &lt;math&gt;\left[ \overline{\lambda_{xi}(t)} -\frac{1}{n-1} \sum \overline{\lambda_{xr}(t)} \right] &lt;/math&gt; contains all other mechanisms (such as the [[storage effect|spatial storage effect]]).&lt;ref name="Chesson2000space" /&gt;

Thus, if Δ''κ'' is positive, then the invader's population is more able to build up its population in good areas (i.e., ''ν&lt;sub&gt;xi&lt;/sub&gt;'' is higher where ''λ&lt;sub&gt;xi&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'') is large), compared to the residents.  This can occur if the invader builds up in good areas (i.e., cov(''ν&lt;sub&gt;xi&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''λ&lt;sub&gt;xi&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'')) is very positive) or if the residents are forced into poor areas (i.e., cov(''ν&lt;sub&gt;xr&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''λ&lt;sub&gt;xr&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'')) is less positive, or negative).  In either case, species gain an advantage when they are invaders, a key point of any [[coexistence theory#Stabilizing mechanisms|stabilizing mechanism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8269">'''Formal equivalence checking''' process is a part of [[electronic design automation]] (EDA), commonly used during the development of [[digital circuit|digital]] [[integrated circuit]]s, to formally prove that two representations of a [[circuit design]] exhibit exactly the same behavior.

== Equivalence checking and levels of abstraction ==

In general, there is a wide range of possible definitions of functional equivalence covering comparisons between different [[level of abstraction|levels of abstraction]] and varying granularity of timing details. 
*The most common approach is to consider the problem of machine equivalence which defines two [[Synchronous circuit|synchronous design]] specifications functionally equivalent if, clock by clock, they produce ''exactly'' the same sequence of output signals for ''any'' valid sequence of input signals. 
*[[Microprocessor]] designers use equivalence checking to compare the functions specified for the [[instruction set]] architecture (ISA) with a [[register transfer level]] (RTL) implementation, ensuring that any program executed on both models will cause an identical update of the main memory content.  This is a more general problem.
*A system design flow requires comparison between a transaction level model (TLM), e.g., written in [[SystemC]] and its corresponding RTL specification. Such a check is becoming of increasing interest in a system-on-a-chip (SoC) design environment.

== Synchronous machine equivalence ==
The [[register transfer level]] (RTL) behavior of a digital chip is usually described with a [[hardware description language]], such as [[Verilog]] or [[VHDL]]. This description is the golden reference model that describes in detail which operations will be executed during which [[clock cycle]] and by which pieces of hardware. Once the logic designers, by simulations and other verification methods, have verified register transfer description, the design is usually converted into a [[netlist]] by a [[logic synthesis]] tool. Equivalence is not to be confused with functional correctness, which must be determined by [[functional verification]].

The initial [[netlist]] will usually undergo a number of transformations such as optimization, addition of [[Design For Test]] (DFT) structures, etc., before it is used as the basis for the placement of the logic elements into a [[physical layout]]. Contemporary physical design software will occasionally also make significant modifications (such as replacing logic elements with equivalent similar elements that have a higher or lower [[drive strength and/or area]]) to the netlist. Throughout every step of a very complex, multi-step procedure, the original functionality and the behavior described by the original code must be maintained. When the final [[tape-out]] is made of a digital chip, many different EDA programs and possibly some manual edits will have altered the netlist.

In theory, a logic synthesis tool guarantees that the first netlist is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to the RTL source code.  All the programs later in the process that make changes to the netlist also, in theory, ensure that these changes are logically equivalent to a previous version.

In practice, programs have bugs and it would be a major risk to assume that all steps from RTL through the final tape-out netlist have been performed without error. Also, in real life, it is common for designers to make manual changes to a netlist, commonly known as [[Engineering Change Order]]s, or ECOs, thereby introducing a major additional error factor.    Therefore, instead of blindly assuming that no mistakes were made, a verification step is needed to check the logical equivalence of the final version of the netlist to the original description of the design (golden reference model).

Historically, one way to check the equivalence was to re-simulate, using the final netlist, the test cases that were developed for verifying the correctness of the RTL. This process is called gate level [[logic simulation]]. However, the problem with this is that the quality of the check is only as good as the quality of the test cases. Also, gate-level simulations are notoriously slow to execute, which is a major problem as the size of digital designs continues to grow [[exponent]]ially.

An alternative way to solve this is to formally prove that the RTL code and the netlist synthesized from it have exactly the same behavior in all (relevant) cases. This process is called formal equivalence checking and is a problem that is studied under the broader area of [[formal verification]].

A formal equivalence check can be performed between any two representations of a design: RTL &lt;&gt; netlist, netlist &lt;&gt; netlist or RTL &lt;&gt; RTL, though the latter is rare compared to the first two. Typically, a formal equivalence checking tool will also indicate with great precision at which point there exists a difference between two representations.

== Methods ==
There are two basic technologies used for boolean reasoning in equivalence checking programs:
*[[Binary decision diagram]]s, or BDDs: A specialized data structure designed to support reasoning about boolean functions. BDDs have become highly popular because of their efficiency and versatility.
*Conjunctive Normal Form Satisfiability: [[Boolean satisfiability problem|SAT]] solvers returns an assignment to the variables of a [[propositional formula]] that satisfies it if such an assignment exists.  Almost any boolean reasoning problem can be expressed as a SAT problem.

== Commercial applications for equivalence checking ==
Major products in the Logic Equivalence Checking (''LEC'') area of ''EDA'' are:

* ''FormalPro'' by [[Mentor Graphics]]
* ''Questa SLEC'' by [[Mentor Graphics]]
* ''Conformal'' by [[Cadence Design Systems|Cadence]]
* ''JasperGold'' by [[Cadence Design Systems|Cadence]]
* ''Formality'' by [[Synopsys]]
* ''VC Formal'' by [[Synopsys]]
* ''360 EC'' by [[OneSpin Solutions]]
* ''ATEC'' by [[ATEC Technologies, Inc.|ATEC]]

== Generalizations ==
*Equivalence Checking of Retimed Circuits:  Sometimes it is helpful to move logic from one side of a register to another, and this complicates the checking problem.
*Sequential Equivalence Checking:  Sometimes, two machines are completely different at the combinational level, but should give the same outputs if given the same inputs.  The classic example is two identical state machines with different encodings for the states. Since this cannot be reduced to a combinational problem, more general techniques are required.
*Equivalence of Software Programs, i.e. checking if two well-defined programs that take N inputs and produce M outputs are equivalent:  Conceptually, you can turn software into a state machine (that's what the combination of a compiler does, since a computer plus its memory form a very large state machine.)  Then, in theory, various forms of property checking can ensure they produce the same output.  This problem is even harder than sequential equivalence checking, since the outputs of the two programs may appear at different times; but it is possible, and researchers are working on it.

The '''Fraunhofer Institute for Mechanics of Materials IWM''' ({{lang-de|Fraunhofer-Institut für Werkstoffmechanik}}) in [[Freiburg]], Germany, is a division of the [[Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft]] which focuses upon application-oriented research. The Fraunhofer IWM is a research and development partner for both industry and public institutions whose themes include the safety, reliability, life expectancy and functionality of materials in components and manufacturing processes. The broad spectrum of services offered by the Fraunhofer IWM's business units aid their clients and project partners in the assessment and continuing development of highly stressed materials and components and in the optimization of production process. Established in 1971 in Freiburg in Breisgau, the institute expanded in 1992 to include a location in Halle (Saale). On January 1, 2016, the Halle division of the Fraunhofer IWM became the [[Fraunhofer Institute for Microstructure of materials and Systems]] IMWS.

== Competencies==
Mechanics of Materials at the Fraunhofer IWM address all issues concerning functionality, behavior and the specific properties of materials from the development stage through manufacture, processing and application. Via the material-mechanical expertise of the scientists at the institute, the properties, functionality and stress limitations of materials and components are assessed, adjusted and improved as per specific requirements set forth by their clients. This in-depth know-how lies within situations in which complex and extreme load conditions exist for materials in components and manufacturing processes as well as in performance and efficiency improvements that can only be achieved through a holistic understanding of the various aspects involved. The interaction between experimentation and simulations yields solutions to materials-related issues for nearly all industry sectors.  The scientific, technical “tools” that make up the core competencies of the institute consist of:

== Material and component characterization ==

The Fraunhofer IWM characterizes and assesses material properties within components and production processes as well as the behavior of components across several scales and analyzes the development, manufacturing and application of materials and components and offers critical support by realizing new functionalities and processing steps.

== Material modeling and simulation ==

The Fraunhofer IWM develops and employs mechanism-based material models in order to understand and explain the inner structures of material properties.  These structural property-relationships have a strong influence both on the manufacturing process and in actual application.

== Tribology and surface design ==

Stress and loads which affect the surfaces of components are analyzed and modified for optimal functionality and performance.

== Research==
Research and development activities at the Fraunhofer IWM are organized into five business units where similar project topics are grouped together in each unit. Pools of experts with the necessary competencies to achieve the desired goal are assembled from the various groups.

=== Materials Design ===
Material behavior is explained and material properties are predicted using computational and experimental methods based on solid-state physics and materials mechanics. In this way can material structures, properties, and functions be defined. The effects of crystalline defects and microstructures on the macroscopic behavior of materials are identified, enabling the effective and efficient use of material and energy resources in order to achieve long-term improvements to technical systems.

=== Manufacturing Processes ===
A vast understanding of processes and sophisticated simulation techniques enables the design of efficient and safe manufacturing processes. Services include investigations into the technological development of manufacturing processes for the production of semi-finished products and components with functional properties. This work ranges from powder technology processes, including complex fluid systems, to microfluids, the forming and processing of ductile materials as well as processing techniques for brittle materials and glass forming.

=== Tribology ===
This business unit carries out research into friction and wear. Tribological systems are optimized and solutions are developed  that reduce friction and protect against wear with the aid of technical ceramics, innovative lubricants, tribological layer systems and tribo-materials conditioned for manufacturing technology. Friction, abrasion, running-in and wear mechanisms are investigated as they affect the tribo-chemistry of machine elements such as roller and slide bearings, cutting and forming tools or motor and gear elements. Experimental techniques, multi-scale modeling and numerical simulations as well as microstructure analysis are employed.

=== Component Safety and Lightweight Construction ===
This work is centered on the assessment of a component's safety and its fitness for purpose in terms of safety-relevant demands under operational loads. The applications range from proving the safety of power station components to confirming the fault tolerances of aerospace components, the life expectancy analysis of components in power stations and vehicles subjected to thermomechanical loads to crash analyses of vehicle components. The focus is on the operational behavior of modern materials as well as joins and hybrid constructions. Development work is also carried out on mechanism-based material models for a wide range of applications with which to describe the deformation and failure behavior of components under thermal and mechanical loads. Crash analysis increasingly involves determining the influence of the manufacturing process on the failure behavior of vehicle structures.

=== Assessment of Materials, Lifetime Concepts ===
The influence of microstructures, internal stresses and damage on component functionality and life expectancy are assessed. Particular interest is paid to linking specific analyses and experiments with advanced material models as well as in understanding the demands placed on components. The work is focused on modeling cyclical thermomechanical loads and on identifying the degradation mechanisms involved in corrosion, stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement. In acute cases of damage, the institute can carry out surveys.

== Finances and staff ==
The operating budget is financed through external earnings and institutional funding (core funding). The operating budget for 2017 amounted to 20.3 million euro, of which 48.5% came from industry revenues. The investment budget for 2017 was 2.9 million euro.

At the end of 2017 the institute employed 225 permanent staff: 122 scientists, 42 technical staff, 65 infrastructure staff and 10 apprentices. Including the 68 academic assistants as well as interns, the Fraunhofer IWM had 293 employees in 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41347">'''Gender policing''' is the imposition or enforcement of [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] [[gender expression]]s on an individual who is perceived as [[gender variance|not adequately performing]], through appearance or behavior, the [[assigned sex|sex that was assigned to them at birth]] (see [[gender performativity]]). Gender policing serves to devalue or delegitimize expressions that deviate from normative conceptions of gender, thus reinforcing the [[gender binary]]. According to [[Judith Butler]], rejection of individuals who are non-normatively gendered is a component of creating one's own gender identity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Judith Butler|url=http://lauragonzalez.com/TC/BUTLER_gender_trouble.pdf|editor=Laura J. Nicholson|title=Gender Trouble Feminism and the Subversion of Identity|publisher=Routledge|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gender mainstreaming]] is a [[public policy]] concept, whereas gender policing is a more general [[social phenomenon]].

It is common for normative gender performances of gender to be encouraged and rewarded, while non-normative performances are discouraged through punishment or generally negative reactions. Policing of non-normative performances ranges in intensity from relatively minor discouraging comments to brutal acts of violence. Tactics of gender policing also vary widely, depending in part on the perceived gender of the individual target.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/roots/franklin.html|title=The Roots Of Homophobia - Inside The Mind Of People Who Hate Gays - Assault On Gay America |publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Heteronormativity and the gender binary==

Gender policing aims to keep gender roles rigid and aligned according to the [[gender binary]]. The gender binary is the idea that gender exists as the opposition between man and woman. [[Heteronormativity]], as an institution, is an extension of this belief that posits that gender and sexuality are expressions of biology. This functionalism of biology asserts that male and female genitalia only serve the purpose of procreation, which creates gender roles that manifest from a perceived innate desire, giving sexuality a specific purpose within society.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

[[Gayle Rubin]]'s writing in "The Traffic in Women" links the creation of the gender binary to the subordination of women in western society. Rubin studied the works of [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Levi Strauss]] to gain a better understanding of the creation of the "sex/gender system". Rubin found that "woman" was a role created in opposition to "man" and served the purpose of building power, trade relationships, and mutual aid through the exchange of women by marriage. These [[Kinship]] systems necessitated rules, which had to be policed to ensure their continued survival. These rules crystalized into heteronormativity, culturally instilling the rules for accepted sexuality in western society.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://genderstudiesgroupdu.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/the-rraffic-in-women.pdf|contribution=The Traffic in Women|last=Rubin|first=Gayle|title=Literary Theory: An Anthology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gender binary in western society was formalized from the interpretations of men and women during the [[hunter-gatherer]] ages. During this [[Mesolithic]] or Middle Stone Age in North-West Europe, hunting and gathering food was a prominent survival strategy. Early interpretations of these survival techniques is one of the main reasons for the current idea of the gender binary within western society. In his review of the ethnography of gathering shellfish, Clive Bonsall incorrectly presumed that women and children were primarily gatherers and men were the hunters do to their stronger skill set. These assumptions of past societies shaped the current structure of western society into the beliefs that men are the providers and women are the supporters. Additionally in the idea of heterosexual marriage as the societal norm came from the analysis of the interactions between different Mesolithic populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobb|first=Hannah|date=2005|title=Straight down the line? A queer consideration of hunter-gatherer studies in north-west Europe|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00438240500395862|journal=World Archaeology|volume=37|issue=4|pages=630–636|doi=10.1080/00438240500395862|issn=0043-8243|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another mentality that strengthens the idea of binary gender within western society is the warrior-breeder relationship. In this mentality, masculinity is characterized by the traits of the model warrior: strong and fearless, yet disposable. Meanwhile, femininity and womanhood revolve around reproduction. In this relationship, there are only two types of people; therefore, two genders. This dichotomy is valued because it keeps society safe in times of war. The warriors fight and protect while the breeders replace the fallen warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=6. Gender Terrorism, Gender Sacrifice Getting beyond Zero-Sum Heterosexuality|date=2014-01-31|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7312/digb16840-007|work=Love and War|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231538404|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the works of LGB activism during the late 1980’s to 1990’s, the [[queer theory]] was created along with the influential work of Foucault and Sedgewick. The queer theory creates a space outside the gender binary. This theory deconstructs and discredits the idea of a gender binary. Disregarding the gender binary caused fears within the western society, ultimately leading to gender policing in order to maintain the idea of binary gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/j.ctt183q5wt|title=Gender Politics|last=Monro|first=Surya|date=2015-11-30|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=9781849644952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Man and woman as categories can not exist without the other to enforce what they are and are not. The same can be said of heterosexuality and homosexuality. These categories are created out of their opposition, forming power dynamics. [[Michel Foucault]] referred to this creation of identities, through creating discourse surrounding the ideal, as reverse discourse. This antagonistic relationship between identities is the basis for gender policing. Deviation from normative expression, of either gender or sexuality, is often met with varying degrees violence.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Spargo, Tamsin. Post Modern Encounters Foucault and Queer Theory. New York: Totem, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patriarchy and hegemonic masculinity==

[[Patriarchy|Patriarchal]] societies perpetuate masculine dominance in all aspects of life. Patriarchy privileges masculine thought and expression creating a gender hierarchy where women and the feminine are subordinated. The concept of [[hegemonic masculinity]] describes a hierarchy even within masculinity itself. Hegemonic masculinity allows for the terms and expression of masculinity to be renegotiated according to time, culture, and class status, allowing for the rationalization of its continued dominance.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Connell | first1 = R.W. | last2 = Messerschmidt | first2 = James W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Hegemonic masculinity: rethinking the concept | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 829–859 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243205278639 | date = December 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0891243205278639 | ref = harv| postscript = .}} [http://xyonline.net/sites/default/files/Connell,%20Hegemonic%20masculinity_0.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist, [[Raewyn Connell]] created the theory of hegemonic masculinity in order to explain the relationships between men and women and between the class of men within a patriarchal system. This theory is based on Antonio Gramsci’s concept of hegemony –– conformity or subordination of one group which creates class-based domination. Connell’s theory explains the ways in which ideal or normalized masculine traits have the highest values in western society. These masculine attributes include wealth, control over resources, fertility, attractiveness, heterosexuality, physical strength, and emotional detachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9781400842629|title=The New Arab Man|last=Inhorn|first=Marcia C.|date=2012-01-31|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400842629|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demetrakis Z. Demetriou further divided hegemonic masculinity into two types: external and internal. External hegemonic masculinity refers to the subordination of women under men. Internal hegemonic masculinity is the spectrum of masculinity seen within men. This spectrum is defined by the amount of power and masculinity a man holds. The patriarchy needs hegemonic masculinity in order to maintain power. In order to keep this power, men must be policed and women must me dominated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Connell|first=R. W.|last2=Messerschmidt|first2=James W.|date=2005|title=Hegemonic Masculinity|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0891243205278639|journal=Gender &amp; Society|volume=19|issue=6|pages=829–859|doi=10.1177/0891243205278639|issn=0891-2432|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ideal form of masculinity is seen by patriarchal power, men that fit in this norm are seen as what a human should embody.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lemon|first=Jennifer|date=1995|title=Masculinity in Crisis?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4065897|journal=Agenda|issue=24|pages=61|doi=10.2307/4065897|issn=1013-0950}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The gender hierarchy created by patriarchy and hegemonic masculinity creates competition for dominance resulting in the policing of gender and sexuality. Policing of masculinity in a heteronormative society reinforces the gender binary. Individuals seeking to reaffirm their position in a masculine hierarchy seek out and police individuals performing inadequately. Those performing inadequately must either conform to the accepted forms of gender and sexual expression or risk violence and ostracism.&lt;ref name="pbs.org" /&gt;

Fathers are more likely than mothers to enforce gender boundaries, or police the gendered expressions of their children. Second, both fathers and mothers enforce gender boundaries more frequently with sons than with daughters.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; Research on the topic of parental gender policing has shown that female children who display traditionally masculine traits or behaviors receive more social and parental acceptance than male children who exhibit traditionally feminine tendencies.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many scholars on the subject argue that this is due to the greater value assigned to "masculine" traits or behaviors compared to "feminine" ones, and/or beliefs that "tomboyism" is temporary.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At least one study indicates that parents across various social locations celebrate and encourage their preschool age daughters to engage in gender nonconformity, such as wearing sports-themed clothing and participating in traditionally male activities.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; However, other research indicates that in part due to peer and parental pressures, "tomboys", or female children with "masculine" traits or behavioral tendencies, frequently either abandon these tendencies in adolescence, or adopt a more feminine performance but retain many masculine skills and traits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pressures to conform to gender norms increase with age, and often manifest in these children being "instructed or shamed to conform to traditional femininity – in dress, appearance, posture, manner, interests, and dating."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Psychoanalysis== 

Fields of knowledge that claim to be universal are still created within societal frameworks that have their own rules and biases. A patriarchal society gives privilege to masculine thought and excludes other points of view and histories. All discourse created in a patriarchal society can be said to acquiesce to hegemonic masculinity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

Michel Foucault viewed [[Psychoanalysis]] as a secular confession concerned with finding our natural sexual selves. The problem, Foucault argued, is that sexuality is cultural and any narrative created around it gives the subject the illusion of identity rather than experience. Psychoanalysis conducted in a hetero-normative society would view any deviation as a failing to achieve that ideal. Rather than someone being seen as performing an act, they would be seen as embodying that which society deemed inadequate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

Gayle Rubin wrote about Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theory in "The Traffic In Women". Rubin states that [[Jacques Lacan]]'s analysis of Freud views the [[Oedipus complex]] as the crisis experienced by a child when internalizing kinship rules. The child becomes aware of the sex/gender system and organizes itself accordingly. [[Neurosis]] is seen as having an understanding of this system yet failing to adapt to it. Lacan's separation of the [[Phallus]] from the physical penis elucidates societies privileging of the masculine and gender's separation from biology. In Rubin's view psychiatry further policed accepted gender and sexual expression by deeming non normative behavior as mentally and emotionally stunted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sites.middlebury.edu/sexandsociety/files/2015/01/Rubin-Thinking-Sex.pdf|title=Thinking Sex|last=Rubin|first=Gayle|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubin also saw that this system of internalizing norms privileged heterosexual masculinity while outlining the psychic oppression society inflicts on women and femininity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Intersectionality ==

Gender policing affects different social identifications in different ways. Along with gender, characteristic attributes such as [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[gender identity]], [[Social class|class]], [[sexual orientation]], age, religion, [[creed]], and disability interact with each other and are affected differently by gender policing. The effect of intersection of these social categories are studied in [[intersectionality]] theory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalsocialtheory.org/topics/coloniality-of-gender/|title=Coloniality of Gender – GLOBAL SOCIAL THEORY|website=globalsocialtheory.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Understanding intersectionality within gender policing can be done by tracing back and analyzing the relation between race and gender in history. Race and gender over time produced hierarchies within themselves. Similar to the way the classification of "man" cannot exist without "woman", "white" people cannot exist without "black" people. Race as a classification arose from European capitalist colonialism. European colonists deemed those who weren't "white", primitive and deserving of domination and "civilizing". Global colonialism by European capitalists imposed European ways of knowing and being on the peoples they colonized. This included a racialized and patriarchal conception of gender. The view of colonized peoples as primitive created a distinction between "white" (human) and "black" (property or inhuman). The view of "black" as other than human excluded "black" people from classifications of gender. In western society, being "white" and middle class continue to inform gender norms, leaving "non-white" people unable to perform accepted [[femininity]] or [[masculinity]].

In modern day times, intersectionality now touches upon various other forms of human characterizations, affecting people in countless different ways. How a white transgender woman may experience gender policing is going to differ greatly from how an asian heterosexual woman might (etc). 

==Socialization==

An individual's expression of gender is often first policed by their parent(s), as well as other elder authorities such as teachers and day care providers, at a very young age. Gender policing is part of the process of "gendering" children, or socializing them in a way considered conventionally appropriate to their assigned sex. Once children are taught gender norms and experience their enforcement, they are likely to begin policing others – both their peers and their elders.

=== Early Childhood ===
Gender policing begins with gender enforcing from parents teaching their children what is "masculine" and what is "feminine" in the traditional sense of these terms. These traditional ideas of gender are reinforced through practices such as referring to children as "boys" and "girls" which "makes sex/ gender the central component of how kids think of themselves, understand their social group, and view themselves through their parents’ eyes."&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1rrd98k|title=Chasing Rainbows: Exploring Gender Fluid Parenting Practices|last=|first=|date=2013|publisher=Demeter Press|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Green|editor-first=Fiona Joy|location=|pages=|editor-last2=Friedman|editor-first2=May}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Jane Ward, professor of Gender and Sexuality Studies at University of California, Riverside, writes in her chapter of the book ''Chasing Rainbows: Exploring Gender Fluid Parenting Practices'', even parents who hope to redefine "boyhood" or "girlhood" (such as through allowing a "tomboy" daughter, or dressing a son in dresses, for example), still reinforce the concept of gender as a binary which is biologically determined.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; The gender binary is already enforced in obvious places, such as in the segregation of toys in stores, for example.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

Ethnographic research in preschools has also contributed to the body of knowledge related to gender policing. This research has suggested that teachers give their students gendered instructions about what to do with their bodies. Across several schools, teachers gave boys explicit bodily instructions more frequently than girls, indicating that boys' bodies are policed more often than girls'.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;Martin, K. 1998. Becoming a Gendered Body: Practices of Preschools. ''American Sociological Review'', 63(4), 494-511.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this may be because teachers were more forceful with their instructions to girls, who were also usually quicker to follow instructions, thus teachers did not need to repeat themselves as often. Teachers were also more likely to direct boys to cease behaviors (e.g. running, throwing objects), whereas they were more apt to instruct girls to alter them. For example, girls were given directive bodily instructions such as "talk to her, don't yell, sit here, pick that up, be careful, be gentle, give it to me, put it down there."&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; As a result, a wider range of potential activities is available to boys than girls, because although they are dissuaded from some, they are not directed to engage in specific activities as often as girls are. According to Martin, the scholar and sociologist who conducted this research, "Gendering of the body in childhood is the foundation on which further gendering of the body occurs throughout the life course. The gendering of children's bodies makes gender differences feel and appear natural, which allows for such bodily differences to emerge throughout the life course."&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;

Relatively recent efforts have been made to limit gender policing, particularly in childhood. Sweden's reformation of their school system in 1962 resulted in a new curriculum which included objectives to limit gender policing in early education. Within this new curriculum it was determined that "Pre-schools should work to counteract traditional gender and gender roles. Girls and boys in pre-schools should have the same opportunities to try and develop their abilities and interests without being limited by stereotyped gender roles." &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bayne|first=Emma|date=|title=Gender Pedagogy in Swedish Pre-Schools: An Overview|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12147-009-9076-x#citeas|journal=Springer Link|volume=Vol. 26|pages=130-140|via=Springer Link}}&lt;/ref&gt; These preschools, elementary, and secondary schools aim to reduce the gender policing placed onto children, but through doing this must show how teachers and other pedagogical adults may accidentally reinforce gender stereotypes. Tools teachers use to combat this include practices such as keeping journals and videotaping classroom interactions (a practice proposed by Susanne Rithander). A general pedagogical practice in these Swedish schools in called ''compensatory pedagogy'', which plays off the idea that, per traditional gender roles, boys are encouraged to maintain autonomy while girls are encouraged to maintain closeness with others. ''Compensatory pedagogy'' challenges these traditional gender roles by encouraging girls to maintain autonomy and boys to build closeness with others.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Some parents have attempted to limit gender policing through their parenting styles, as is the case with Storm's parents, who chose no to gender their child but instead to wait until their child could decide for his/herself. Unlike the relative success so far of Swedish schools in limiting gender policing, individual efforts by Kathy and David, Storm's parents, faced huge media backlash. In the chapter titled ''Get Your Gender Binary Off My Childhood!: Towards a Movement for Childrenʹs Gender Self-Determination'', Ward shows how Storm's parents were often called deceitful and manipulative, as Ward puts it, "For not revealing what they knew about Storm’s genitals, Kathy and David were accused of hiding Storm’s very selfhood." &lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

=== Adolescence ===
Adolescence is a developmental stage in which [[peer group]]s are especially important, and peer relationships take primacy over familial relationships. It is also a stage during which gender policing amongst peers becomes increasingly common. Adolescents have already been introduced, during childhood, to normative gender expressions and social expectations therein by elders. These expectations are then reinforced during adolescence, largely by peers gender policing one another. In this (and every) stage of development, gender policing is especially prevalent in explicitly gendered environments, such as bathrooms, locker rooms, and sports teams.

''[[Dude, You're a Fag]]'', a book by [[CJ Pascoe]], examines [[masculinity]] and gender policing in high schools through [[ethnographic]] research. Pascoe largely focuses on high school boys' use of the [[Faggot (slang)|fag]] [[epithet]] to establish their own masculinity by questioning or challenging others'. In this context, the use of the fag epithet is a form of gender policing, frequently applied to boys who lack heterosexual prowess or are deemed inadequately masculine or strong. According to Pascoe, "[the fag identity] is fluid enough that boys police their behaviors out of fear of having the fag identity permanently adhere and definitive enough so that boys recognize a fag behavior and strive to avoid it".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dude You're A Fag: Masculinity and Sexuality in High School (2007), by C.J. Pascoe.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of male students of a co-educational, Catholic high school demonstrates insights from adolescent males themselves in regard to gender policing. This study highlights the gender policing of males by each other through exploring the types of bullying being practiced. Forms of bullying (and gender policing) come from accusations of males being homosexual. One participant in the study explains that he was bullied for dancing ballet and described his bullying as "Just a lot to do with being a woman", thus showing an association of specific activities with a specific gender (and that deviance from typical gender roles proves a perceived grounds for bullying). &lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martino|first=Wayne|date=2000-01-01|title=Policing Masculinities: Investigating the Role of Homophobia and Heteronormativity in the Lives of Adolescent School Boys|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3149/jms.0802.213|journal=The Journal of Men's Studies|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=213–236|doi=10.3149/jms.0802.213|issn=1060-8265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the practice of conducting interviews, the study briefly explores an observed policing of male behavior by females. One interviewee "appears to be drawing attention to the different norms for governing the conduct of girls who police boys’ bullying practices through a condemnation of violent behaviors".&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Interviewees also draw attention to the confirmation and reinforcement of attitudes and practices considered "masculine" within males. In addition, these "masculine" identifiers are further enforced through female interaction and confirmation. In conducting these interviews, it is also found how adolescents view the stereotypical concept of masculinity as a concept which is ingrained early on in their lives and “passed on from their fathers".&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== Adulthood ===
During adulthood, gender policing generally becomes more subtle. However, for an individual whose gender is perceived as ambiguous, blatant forms still exist. These range from curious inquiries by children (e.g. "Are you a boy or a girl?") to gender policing in bathrooms (discussed in the following section). People who are gender-normative in appearance experience primarily behavioral gender policing, such as reminders to act in a more (or less) feminine or masculine manner. Men are more often dissuaded and shamed for feminine behavior than women are for masculine behavior. It is theorized that this is due, at least in part, to the higher societal value of masculinity.&lt;ref name="Kane"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kane, E.|year=2006|title=No Way My Boys Are Going to be like That!" Parents' Responses to Children's Gender Nonconformity|journal=Gender and Society|volume=20|issue=2|pages=149–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carr"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Carr, C. L.|year=1998|title=Tomboy Resistance and Conformity: Agency in Social Psychological Gender Theory|journal=Gender and Society|volume=12|issue=5|pages=528–553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender policing has been reinforced in adults for many years. As [[Angela Davis|Angela Y. Davis]] points out, early women's prisons relied on gender policing as a means of reformation. The first women's reformatory in the U.S. opened in Indiana and included areas designed as kitchens, living rooms, and nurseries. The idea was to train women about domesticity through activities such as cooking, sewing, and cleaning.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Are Prisons Obsolete?|last=Davis|first=Angela Y.|publisher=Publishers Group Canada|year=2003|isbn=978-1-58322-581-3|location=Toronto, ON|pages=60-83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sex verification in sports|Sex testing]] and verification in sports and athletics shows gender policing as a practice still relevant to many countries and athletic organizations in recent history. In the case of the nineteen-year-old Missouri runner Helen Stephens in the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Berlin Olympics]], who finished first place in the 100-meter race, many questioned her sex because they could not fathom a the concept of a woman running so quickly. Sex testing and verification has existed throughout human history, even being traced back to practices in ancient Greek contests. Within these Greek traditions, women were deterred from participation and even spectatorship at times. In the examples of both Greek practices and the story of Helen Stephens of Missouri, it can be seen how women are often more likely to be subject to sex verification processes and accusations of deceit (i.e. women are often accused of actually being men disguised as women; men are not often accused of being women disguised as men).&lt;ref name=":43"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/j.ctt18j8xsf|title=Sex Testing: Gender Policing in Women's Sports|last=PIEPER|first=LINDSAY PARKS|date=2016|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252040221|doi=10.5406/j.ctt18j8xsf.5#metadata_info_tab_contents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transgender, androgynous, and gender non-conforming individuals==
The severity of gender policing is often proportional to the extremity of non-normativity. For example, [[transgender]] individuals are likely to be victims of the most extreme and violent forms of gender policing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://incite-national.org/sites/default/files/incite_files/resource_docs/3515_toolkitrev-policinggender.pdf|title=Policing Gender|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research regarding conformity pressures and gender resistance among [[transfeminine]] individuals (those who are assigned the male sex at birth but identify as more feminine than masculine) indicates that these persons experienced "intense and pervasive" pressures to conform to traditional masculinity, and feared exposure of their gender identity would result in physical danger or loss of legal, economic, or social standing.&lt;ref name="Gagne"&gt;Gagné, P., &amp; Tewksbury, R. 1998. Conformity Pressures and Gender Resistance among Transgendered Individuals. ''Social Problems'', 45(1), 81-101.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, transgender individuals must often choose between self-preservation and expressing their self-identified gender.&lt;ref name="Gagne" /&gt;

Gender policing is especially prevalent in bathrooms due to the increased salience of gender in explicitly gendered environments (and the forced binary of "men" and "women").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2010/09/02/guest-post-go-where-sex-gender-and-toilets/|title=Go Where? Sex, Gender, and Toilets - Sociological Images|first=The Society|last=Pages|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this issue is frequently encountered by transgender and [[genderqueer]] individuals, to a lesser extent, it is also experienced by persons with [[androgynous]] or gender ambiguous appearances. For individuals with non-normative gender identities, the choice of which bathroom to use is often laden with "anxiety, ambivalence, and anticipated harassment."&lt;ref name="EmbodiedResistance"&gt;Embodied Resistance: Challenging the Norms, Breaking the Rules (2011), edited by C. Bobel and S. Kwan.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not uncommon for gender-normative people to alert security of the presence of transgender (or androgynous) individuals in a bathroom, regardless of whether the bathroom they are using conforms to their sex or to their gender identity.&lt;ref name="EmbodiedResistance" /&gt; According to [[Judith Halberstam|Jack Halberstam]], the main distinction between gender policing in the women's room and in the men's room is that in the former, not only trans women, but all gender ambiguous females are scrutinized, whereas in the latter, biological males are less frequently deemed out of place.&lt;ref name="FemaleMasculinity"&gt;Female Masculinity (1998), by Judith Halberstam.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, compared to trans women in the women's room, trans men in the men's room are likely to be less scrutinized because men are less vigilant about intruders than women.&lt;ref name="FemaleMasculinity" /&gt; However, a trans man in the men's room is more likely to be met with violence if he does not succeed in [[Passing (sociology)|passing]].&lt;ref name="FemaleMasculinity" /&gt; 

Transwomen and transmen are “six times more likely to experience discrimination” than non-trans people.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bender-Baird|first=Kyla|date=2015-09|title=Peeing under surveillance: bathrooms, gender policing, and hate violence|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0966369X.2015.1073699?needAccess=true&amp;|journal=Gender, Place &amp; Culture|language=en|volume=23|issue=7|pages=983–988|doi=10.1080/0966369x.2015.1073699|issn=0966-369X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 2,000 incidents of anti-LGBT hate crimes were reported to the [[National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs]] in 2013. In 2014, there was a national study of trans violence discovered with the results of  “53% of respondents reporting verbal assault and 8% physical assault in a place of public accommodation”&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. As a site where gender norms are policed, bathrooms are the most common public accommodation where trans people and gender non-conforming people experience hate violence. People tend to believe that there is a connection between genitals and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Westbrook|first=Laurel|last2=Schilt|first2=Kristen|date=2013-09-24|title=Doing Gender, Determining Gender|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243213503203|journal=Gender &amp; Society|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=32–57|doi=10.1177/0891243213503203|issn=0891-2432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the gender segregation of bathrooms is based on genital configuration. Because of this “match” between genitals and gender, trans people often are labeled as “deceivers” and blamed for the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mathers|first=Lain A. B.|date=2017-04-03|title=Bathrooms, Boundaries, and Emotional Burdens: Cisgendering Interactions Through the Interpretation of Transgender Experience|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/symb.295|journal=Symbolic Interaction|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=295–316|doi=10.1002/symb.295|issn=0195-6086}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a trans or androgynous person is questioned in the bathroom, the reaction is “not to reassess the arbitrary nature of segregating bathrooms by sex but to violently eject the trans or gender non-conforming person”&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. Using a public bathroom is no longer a simple matter for trans and gender non-conforming people. 

As of March 2017, 19 states (California, Nevada, Hawaii, New York, etc.), the District of Columbia and over 200 cities have enforced the anti-discrimination law toward transgender people allowing them to use any public restroom that corresponds to their gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/-bathroom-bill-legislative-tracking635951130.aspx|title="Bathroom Bill" Legislative Tracking|last=Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|website=www.ncsl.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, most public accommodations changed their restroom signs where there are both genders and the text “Gender Neutral Restroom” or “Inclusive Restroom”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/07/health/transgender-bathroom-law-facts-myths/index.html|title=3 myths in the transgender bathroom debate|last=CNN|first=Emanuella Grinberg and Dani Stewart,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law was passed because of the March 2016 “[[Bathroom bill|Bathroom Bill]]” in North Carolina. The bill argued that banning people from using public restrooms of their choice due to the biological sex listed on their birth certificates (genitals vs. gender) was unreasonable, therefore, it launched transgender rights into the national spotlight. 

== Fashion and Modern Opposition of Gender Policing ==
In 1924, gender norms accepted and re enforced ideologies that shadowed Freud’s hegemonic thesis that “biology is the key determinant of gender identity”&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3672297/future-gender-norms/|title=The Past, Present and Future of Gender Norms|last=|first=|date=|website=Time|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These norms were imbedded into cultural regularity, affecting gender identity in everyday life, law and politics. Gender policing strategies enforced these norms, and a prevalent tactic was to use culturally obligatory [[Dress code|dress codes]] as a tool in forcing people into gender binaries. However progressive movements throughout history have worked vigorously to defy policing, combating restrictive norms through disregard and reformation of policed gender standards. Following of Freud’s theory has steadily begun to dwindle and new studies are beginning to reveal a popular uprising theory that individuals make their own decisions as to which gender distinguishments apply to them.  Modern opposition of gender norms are erasing the aged policing of conforming to the standards of one’s sex.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; According to a study by Intelligence Group, a consumer insights company, “More than two-thirds of people ages 14 to 34 agree that gender does not have to define a person in the way that it used to… and 6 in 10 say that men and women do not need to conform to traditional gender roles or behaviors anymore.” &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/11/30/363345372/for-these-millennials-gender-norms-have-gone-out-of-style|title=For These Millennials, Gender Norms Have Gone Out Of Style|last=|first=|date=|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

=== Gender Policing Dress Codes ===
Older fashion protocols systematically enforced normative gender binaries, confining people to dress and accessorize in a way that connected to their sex. Society would use gender policing tactics to enforce cultural and societal acceptance of a gendered dress code. Women were to dress in a feminine style, while men had to style themselves in a masculine way. The way one dressed was meant to represent their sex and it’s stereotypes, “Circumstantial or societal norms dictate the outfits we choose to wear, often reflecting the expectations we are held to” &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uresearch.unm.edu/breaking-gender-norms-through-fashion.pdf|title=Breaking Gender Norms through Fashion: Lessons from Georgia O’Keeffe|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Its only recently that most [[Sumptuary law|sumptuary]] type laws, laws used to enforce “gender appropriate clothes” and arrest people who “impersonate” another gender, have been overturned. For example, “a person perceived as male who dressed in clothing customarily designed for women could technically be arrested in New York for “impersonating a female” as recently as 2011 — the remnants of a 19th century statewide law prohibiting wearing “the dress of the opposite sex.”&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/arresting-dress-timeline-anti-cross-dressing-laws-u-s|title=Arresting dress: A timeline of anti-cross-dressing laws in the United States|last=|first=|date=|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Cultural policing tactics such as slut shaming, [[homophobia]] and [[transphobia]] are still used today to police fashion. There is still a long way to go for those pushing for the elimination of policed gendered dress codes.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==== Using Fashion in Modern Opposition ====
This reformation campaign against gender policed conformity has found a focus in developing cultural acceptance for fluidity in modern cultural dress codes. Nowadays decisions on gender identity are seen as self made and a form of “self expression”. A prevalent way of expressing ones identity and not conforming to gender norms is through personal choice in style. These choices include apparel, accessories and beauty habits. Style has a “symbolic meaning” of self expression, “giving us a means to cultivate our own visions of the culture we experience around us”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;. Therefor, fashion nonconformity has expansively become wonted and accepted by a rising number of millennials who believe in bending past policed gendered binaries. They do this by ignoring the outdated dress codes that were previously used to confine someone to their gender identity. In disregarding a dress code that has been used as a weapon in enforcing gender binary, millennials have found a powerful opposition to gender policing.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;


Modern gender-specific fashion has become more flexible to personal preference, becoming visibly more directed against old gendered style constraints. The refusal to conform to the rules of outdated fashion protocol is being embraced by [[a la mode]] fashion and mainstream style. A recent pattern in clothing and accessories that transcend gender style norms has become steadily vogue and evidently pioneering fashion trends have increasingly grown accepting to the fusion of normally gender specific style details.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2017/06/famous-women-who-have-worn-menswear#11|title=Famous Women Have Been Defying Gender Norms and Rocking Menswear for Years|last=Weaver|first=Hilary|date=|website=Vanities|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trendy nonconforming styles empower women to dress in an inclusively “masculine” manner and enable men to adapt “feminine” attributes in their style, for example women choosing to wear suits to work, or men wearing nail polish, etc. &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The '''HMS ''Investigator'' Anchors''' are the two [[anchor]]s that [[Matthew Flinders]] jettisoned from {{HMS|Investigator|1801|6}} on the morning of Saturday 21 May 1803 in order to avoid running aground on [[Middle Island (Western Australia)|Middle Island]] in the [[Archipelago of the Recherche]] on the south coast of [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] (now [[Western Australia]]). In 1973, the anchors were located and recovered by members of the Underwater Explorers Club of South Australia (UEC). The recovered anchors became the subject of an ownership dispute between various governments, particularly those of [[Government of South Australia|South Australia]] and [[Government of Western Australia|Western Australia]] due to their historic significance as artefacts of a major voyage of European exploration. The dispute was resolved with the ownership of the anchors going to the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] who subsequently gifted one of the anchors to the South Australian Government. The pair of artefacts is also known as ''Flinders' Anchors''.

==Background==
The outfitting of HMS ''Investigator'' in early 1801 prior to her departure from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] for [[Terra Australis]] included five [[Anchor#Anchoring gear|bower]], two [[Anchor#Kedging|stream]] and two [[Anchor#Anchoring gear#kredging|kedge]] anchors. An additional bower anchor was included in stores sent to Port Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;Geeson, N.T. and Sexton, R.T.; (1970), 'H.M. Sloop Investigator', pages 293-294, in ''Mariner's Mirror'', v.56, no. 3, Society for Nautical Research, London, pages 275-298.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flinders01.jpg|thumb|left|Flinders around about this time.]]
HMS ''Investigator'' departed [[Kupang]] in [[West Timor|Timor]] on 8 April 1803 to sail to [[Port Jackson]] where she arrived on 9 June 1803. The object of the voyage was to seek medical aid for the members of the crew who were suffering from [[dysentery]] and fever, and seek repairs to the sloop. Flinders' intention was "to stop a day or two" at the Archipelago of the Recherche for "the purposes of procuring geese for our sick people, seal oil for our lamps, and a few casks of salt from the lake on Middle Island." HMS ''Investigator'' arrived on the evening of Tuesday 17 May 1803 and anchored on the north side of Middle Island between the island's north east point and Goose Island in the area known as Goose Island Bay.&lt;ref name=Flinders1803&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flinders|first1=Matthew|title=A voyage to Terra Australis undertaken for the purpose of completing the discovery of that vast country, and prosecuted in the years 1801, 1802 and 1803, in his majesty's ship the Investigator, and subsequently in the armed vessel Porpoise and Cumberland schooner.

The visit to Middle Island also allowed the burial of the sloop's boatswain, Charles Douglas, who died on Wednesday 18 May 1803 to take place on dry land.&lt;ref name=Log&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flinders|first1=Matthew|title=Log of the Investigator, ADM55, Log 76, 14 Mar 1803 to 10 Jan 1804|url=http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/browse/badc/corral/images/adm55/log076/adm55_log076_page032.jpg|publisher=British Atmospheric Data Centre|page=32|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Jeremy|last2=Souter|first2=Corioli|last3=Baker|first3=Patrick|title=Department of Maritime Archaeology Visit to Middle Island, Recherche Archipelago, Esperance, 29 April–4 May 2001, Report–Department of Maritime Archaeology Western Australian Maritime Museum No. 154|url=http://museum.wa.gov.au/maritime-archaeology-db/sites/default/files/no._154_middlei.pdf|publisher=Western Australian Maritime Museum|accessdate=27 February 2015|pages=2-3|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss==
Flinders discovered, on departure during the morning of Saturday 21 May 1803, that HMS ''Investigator'' was in danger of being driven aground on Middle Island by a freshening breeze before the sails could be loosed. This danger was mitigated by using the sloop's spare anchors to hold it in place. However, Flinders needed to abandon the best bower anchor, a stream anchor, and a quantity of cable in order to safely depart from the bay. Instead of recovering the two anchors, HMS ''Investigator'' continued towards Port Jackson with the intention of retrieving these at a later time.&lt;ref name=Log/&gt;

==The discovery and recovery==
Doug Seton, an information officer at the [[South Australian Museum]] found out about the loss of the anchors in 1969 during a conversation with Robert Sexton, a friend and a well-known South Australian maritime historian. Seton then commenced a four-year desktop study to identify the likely area in which the anchors could be found.&lt;ref name=Hooked&gt;{{cite news|title=Team of divers hooked on anchor|publisher=The Sunday Mail|date=24 December 1972|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Seton, a [[scuba diving]] enthusiast, planned an expedition to find and recover the anchors with the assistance of the following fellow members of the UEC - Terry &amp; Helen Drew, Peter &amp; Rosalie Koch and John Summers, the following residents of [[Esperance, Western Australia|Esperance]] - Don Gulvan, Don McKenzie and Tony Moore of Cape Arid Farm, and with the support of the following sponsors - [[BP]], a boating business known as ''Lawton Agencies'' and the [[Adelaide]] newspaper, the [[Sunday Mail (Adelaide)|''Sunday Mail'']].&lt;ref name=Hooked/&gt;&lt;ref name=Seton&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seton|first1=Doug|title=The search and recovery of the Investigator anchor'', a 4 page brochure whose publisher is not identified and which was viewed at the  State Library of South Australia, Call No. 909.096576 S439b|url=http://encore.slsa.sa.gov.au/iii/encore/record/C__Rb1081825__SSeton%2C+Doug__P0%2C1__Orightresult__X3?lang=eng&amp;suite=cobalt|accessdate=1 March 2015|date=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedition departed Adelaide on 26 December 1972 for Esperance. Later that day, the expedition was postponed due to a vehicle accident north of [[Port Wakefield]] which resulted in Terry and Helen Drew being hospitalised, their vehicle being destroyed, their boat being damaged and the two occupants of the other vehicle being killed.&lt;ref&gt;'Three more killed: Holiday road toll now eight', ''The Advertiser'', 27 December 1972, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Terry &amp; Helen Drew would later re-join the expedition to witness the recovery of both anchors.&lt;ref name=SAgetsanchor&gt;{{cite news|title=SA gets anchor|publisher=The Advertiser|date=2 March 1974|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedition resumed and arrived at Middle Island on 4 January 1973. After a week of rough weather, the search commenced on 11 January using a manta board constructed from driftwood and other materials. The best bower anchor was discovered by Peter Koch in 15m deep water on 14 January. After reviewing his desktop research, Seton re-organised the search and found the stream anchor about 9 metres away from the best bower anchor, several hours later.&lt;ref name=Seton/&gt; The news of the discovery was announced on 15 January.&lt;ref&gt;'SA divers trace old anchors', ''The Advertiser'', 16 January 1973, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

As pre-arranged with the then Commonwealth Department of Shipping and Transport, the lighthouse supply tender, [[MV Cape Don|MV ''Cape Don'']], arrived on 19 January to lift both anchors off the seabed and conveyed them to Fremantle for conservation.&lt;ref&gt;'Anchors aweigh!, Must come to SA', ''The Sunday Mail'', 21 January 1973, page 128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The return of Flinders anchors', ''BP Shield International'', October 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;’Flinders anchors’, Fremantle Cockburn News, 6 February 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dispute over ownership==
As soon as the news of the discovery of the two anchors was announced, a dispute erupted over who was the owner of these artefacts. The protagonists were the governments of Australia, South Australia and Western Australia. The Australian Government argued that it was in the national interest for it to own the anchors, South Australia argued the significance of the anchors as a part of the sloop that charted most of its coastline, while Western Australia argued that the anchors were found in its waters. The dispute was resolved when the Australian government took ownership of both anchors in April 1973, with the best bower anchor being subsequently gifted to South Australia.&lt;ref&gt;’Keep Anchors here’, ''The Esperance Advertiser'', 12 January 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;’After 170 years the battle begins for Flinders’ anchors’, ''The Australian'', 16 March 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;’Let’s pull together to keep anchors’, ''The News'' (Adelaide), 26 March 1973, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=success&gt;{{cite news|title=SA succeeds in claim to anchor|publisher=The Advertiser|date=14 April 1973|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Display==
In 1974, after completion of the conservation process at the [[Western Australian Museum]], the anchors were handed over to the Australian Government. The best bower anchor was officially presented to the South Australian Government on 1 March 1974 and was immediately placed on display at the [[Art Gallery of South Australia]].&lt;ref name=SAgetsanchor/&gt; In 1986, it was transferred to the collection of the then newly created [[South Australian Maritime Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;'Last 'voyage' for ship's anchor', ''The Advertiser'', 9 October 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stream anchor was retained by the Australian Government for the possible inclusion in the collection of a proposed national transport museum.&lt;ref name=success/&gt; This anchor was subsequently added to the collection of the [[National Museum of Australia]].&lt;ref name=NMA/&gt;

==Significance==
The Collection statement prepared by the South Australian Maritime Museum for the Best Bower Anchor advises the following:&lt;ref name=SAMM/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Matthew Flinders was the first to chart the then uncompleted coastline of South Australia and use the name [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] for the continent. The anchor is one of the few remaining physical relics linked to Flinders' exploration of the southern coastline and one of the earliest relics of European presence in South Australia.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Collection statement prepared by the National Museum of Australia for the Stream Anchor advises the following:&lt;ref name=NMA/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This collection highlights one of the important voyages of discovery and the naming of Australia by Matthew Flinders. Flinders circumnavigated Australia and confirmed its island status after many years of conjecture and uncertainty.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aftermath==
The positive public response to the successful UEC expedition was a major driver in the creation in 1974 by Seton and others of a dedicated amateur maritime archaeology organisation, the [[Society for Underwater Historical Research]] (SUHR).&lt;ref&gt;Brock, A.E., 1977, 'The Society for Underwater Historical Research of South Australia', In Green, J. (Ed.), 1977, ''Papers from the First Southern Hemisphere Conference on Maritime Archaeology'', Perth, Western Australia, Oceans Society of Australia, Australian Sports Publications, Melbourne, Victoria, pp. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, I.; (2001), 'Sport Diving on South Australian Shipwrecks', ''Soundings'' (2nd series), Vol. 2 No. 4 (October–December 2001), Society for Underwater Historical Research, Port Adelaide, SA, page 9. However, the founding year is stated as being 1975 rather than 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the approaches used by the UEC during the expedition such as seeking major corporate sponsorship, engagement with both political leaders and local communities, and the pro-active use of print and [[electronic media]] were continued in the work of the SUHR, particularly on projects concerning the ''[[Loch Vennachar]]'' and [[Water Witch (1835 cutter)|''Water Witch'']] shipwrecks.&lt;ref&gt;Marfleet, B. &amp; Hale, A.; (1977) 'Logistics of Loch Vennachar Expedition 1977', Annex A (4 pages) in ''Loch Vennachar Expedition Report'', Society for Underwater Historical Research, North Adelaide, SA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery, W.F., (1987), ''The Water Witch Wrecksite, A Report on the Identification, Survey &amp; Partial Recovery of the Wrecksite'', Department of Environment &amp; Planning, Adelaide SA, page xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The recovery of the anchors and their connection to the voyage of HMS ''Investigator'' is commemorated in the inclusion of the best bower anchor and the outline of the Australian continent on the SUHR emblem.&lt;ref&gt;'Second Annual Report, September 1976', pp.2, in Cowan, David (editor), (2007), ''The Society for Underwater Historical Research – Publications 1974-2004'', Society for Underwater Historical Research, Port Adelaide, SA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''High Value Manufacturing Catapult''' ('''HVM Catapult''') is a group of manufacturing research centres in the United Kingdom which forms part of the [[Catapult centres]] initiative.

==History==
Catapult centres were set up by [[Swindon]]'s [[Innovate UK]] (formerly the Technology Strategy Board).

The HVM Catapult was created with £140m of government funding and was the first Catapult centre to open, in October 2011. In 2016, manufacturing employed 2.6m people in the UK, and contributed 11% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theengineer.co.uk/the-future-of-uk-manufacturing-solving-our-productivity-puzzle/ The Engineer August 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and funding==
The HVM Catapult has offices at the Blythe Valley Business Park, off junction 4 of the M42 in [[Cheswick Green]], Solihull, West Midlands. It is a [[Private company limited by guarantee]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07708659|title=High Value Manufacturing Catapult|last=|first=|date=|website=Companies House|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its members are seven national centres:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hvm.catapult.org.uk/hvm-centres/|title=HVM Catapult Centres|last=|first=|date=|work=High Value Manufacturing Catapult|access-date=26 August 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company applies for grant funding from Innovate UK, on behalf of itself and its members, and makes grants to the members with the funding received. In the year to March 2017, £89m of grant funding was received alongside £67m collaborative income from the private sector; at 31 March 2017 there were 2,114 employees in total at the centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07708659/filing-history|title=HVM Catapult: Full Accounts to 31 March 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=Companies House|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, each of the centres received allocations from a package of new government funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ukri.org/news/chancellor-announces-funding-for-catapult-network/|title=Chancellor announces funding for Catapult network|last=|first=|date=10 August 2018|website=UK Research and Innovation|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6802">'''Histogenesis''' is the formation of different [[Biological tissue|tissues]] from undifferentiated [[cell (biology)|cells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=histogenesis definition - Dictionary - MSN Encarta |url=http://www.encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/Histogenesis.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwqdxnnP?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/histogenesis.html |archivedate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These cells are constituents of three primary [[germ layer]]s, the [[endoderm]], [[mesoderm]], and [[ectoderm]]. The science of the microscopic structures of the tissues formed within histogenesis is termed [[histology]].

==Germ layers==
[[File:Gastrulation.png|thumb|300px|'''[[Gastrulation]] of a [[diploblasty|diploblast]]:''' The formation of germ layers from a (1) [[blastula]] to a (2) [[gastrula]]. Some of the ectoderm cells (orange) move inward forming the endoderm (red).]]
{{main|Germ layer}}
A '''germ layer''' is a collection of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, formed during animal and mammalian [[embryogenesis]]. Germ layers are typically pronounced within [[vertebrate]] organisms; however, [[animal]]s or mammals more complex than [[sea sponge|sponge]]s ([[eumetazoa]]ns and [[wikispecies:agnotozoa|agnotozoans]]) produce two or three primary tissue layers. Animals with [[symmetry (biology)#Radial symmetry|radial symmetry]], such as [[cnidaria]]ns, produce two layers, called the [[ectoderm]] and [[endoderm]]. Therefore, they are [[diploblastic]]. Animals with [[symmetry (biology)#Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry]] produce a third layer in-between called [[mesoderm]], making them [[triploblastic]]. Germ layers will eventually give rise to all of an animal’s or mammal's [[biological tissue|tissues]] and [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s through a process called [[organogenesis]].

===Endoderm===
{{main|Endoderm}}
The '''endoderm''' is one of the germ to penes 
layers formed during animal embryogenesis. Cells migrating inward along the [[archenteron]] form the inner layer of the [[gastrula]], which develops into the [[endoderm]]. Initially, the endoderm consists of flattened cells, which subsequently become columnar.

===Mesoderm===
{{main|Mesoderm}}
The '''mesoderm''' germ layer forms in the [[embryo]]s of [[animal]]s and [[mammal]]s more complex than [[cnidaria]]ns, making them [[triploblastic]]. During [[gastrulation]], some of the cells migrating inward to form the [[endoderm]] form an additional layer between the endoderm and the [[ectoderm]]. A theory suggests that this key innovation evolved hundreds of millions of years ago and led to the evolution of nearly all large, complex animals. The formation of a mesoderm led to the formation of a [[body cavity|coelom]]. Organs formed inside a coelom can freely move, grow, and develop independently of the body wall while fluid cushions and protects them from shocks.

===Ectoderm===
{{main|Ectoderm}}
The '''ectoderm''' is the start of a tissue that covers the body surfaces. It emerges first and forms from the outermost of the [[germ layer]]s.

==Production==
[[File:Germ layers.jpg|thumb|575px|The [[endoderm]] produces tissue within the [[lung]]s, [[thyroid]], and [[pancreas]]. The [[mesoderm]] aids in the production of [[cardiac muscle]], [[skeletal muscle]], [[smooth muscle]], tissues within the [[kidney]]s, and [[red blood cell]]s. The [[ectoderm]] produces tissues within the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and aids in the formation of [[neuron]]s within the brain, and [[melanocytes]].]]

The proceeding graph represents the products produced by the three germ layers.

'''Intradialytic parenteral nutrition''' ('''IDPN''') is a nutritional support therapy ([[medical nutrition therapy]]) for people on [[hemodialysis]] who have a difficult time maintaining adequate nutrition. It is administered directly into the bloodstream of patients suffering from [[chronic kidney disease]] (CKD) in an effort to decrease the associated morbidity and mortality experienced in patients with [[renal failure]]. IDPN contains protein ([[amino acid]]s), [[carbohydrate]]s ([[dextrose]]), and [[fat]]s ([[lipids]]) in an attempt to meet a patient's weekly nutritional needs. Solutions can be individualized for each patient based on weight, needs, medical history and enteral intake.

==History==
Prior to 1990, traditional therapies for [[dialysis]] patients such as liberalized diet and oral supplements, led to protein malnutrition and/or calorie malnutrition.

Efforts to supplement nutritional intake by providing nutrients during the dialysis procedure were attempted. As a result, IDPN became an established therapy to replete malnourished CKD-5 dialysis patients in the early 1990s. Generally the patients received a set formulation containing standard amounts of dextrose, amino acids and lipids regardless of the patient's weight, dialysis time and complicating co-morbid conditions.

==New approach to IDPN therapy==
To address specific nutritional needs of individual patients, several providers of IDPN therapy developed formulations that take clinical variables into account in order to best fit the patient’s individual needs and condition. Specific formulations address distinct differences between nutritional needs of those patients who exhibit protein malnutrition and those patients who exhibit calorie malnutrition.

The '''''Iron Science Teacher''''' is a national competition that celebrates innovation and creativity in science teaching. The competition originated at the [[Exploratorium]] in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=calgary&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Science Teacher 2011|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/news/utoday/march15-2011/iron_science|accessdate=10-2-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parodying the cult Japanese TV program, “[[Iron Chef]],” this competition showcases science teachers as they devise classroom activities using a particular ingredient — an everyday item such as a plastic bag, milk carton, or nail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Science Teacher: At the Explo and Live Webcast|url=http://press.exploratorium.edu/iron-science-teacher-live-webcast-june-2011/|accessdate=10-2-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Contestants are currently or formally part of the Exploratorium's Teacher Institute and compete before a live audience for the title of "Iron Science Teacher."  Shows are also archived on the [http://www.exploratorium.edu/tv/index.php?project=11 Exploratorium's site].

Astrophysicist Dr. Linda Shore, Director of the Exploratorium Teacher Institute and host of the competition, says one goal of the Iron Science Teacher is to "provide teachers with ideas about how to teach multimillion dollar state and national science teaching standards using, trash, recyclables, and inexpensive materials" as well as "to allow teachers to receive applause for great teaching."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Science Teacher|url=http://www.exo.net/~pauld/iron_science_teacher/ironsciencensta2003.html|publisher=Exploratorium|accessdate=10-2-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Back in 1997, the Exploratorium's Phyllis C. Wattis Webcast Studio was looking for new shows. During a staff brainstorming session, a fan of the popular Food Network television show, [[The Iron Chef]], suggested naming a secret ingredient for science teachers to use in an experiment to present to the audience. "It was honestly and truly a joke," Shore says. "We thought we'd do one show."&lt;ref name=da&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Science Teacher|url=http://www.districtadministration.com/article/iron-science-teacher|publisher=District Administration|accessdate=10-2-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Shows==
Now 10 to 12 shows are produced annually for the Exploratorium's website. "Secret" ingredients, which are revealed in advance to participants so they can practice, have included everything from ordinary baking soda and food coloring to Marshmallow Peeps and pantyhose.&lt;ref name=da /&gt;

==Spin-offs==
The Canadian Iron Science Teacher also parodies the popular TV series Iron Chef and is hosted by Jay Ingram of Daily Planet on Discovery Channel.&lt;ref name=calgary /&gt;   Unlike the Exploratorium version, where championship comes with no tangible prize, in the Canadian version, five "finalist" teachers, with their support teams, are selected to compete in the Iron Science Teacher finals at the University of Calgary in order to win a variety of cash prizes.  

Colorado Springs, CO initiated their own CoOL Iron Science Teacher Competition as part of their What If: A Festival of Creativity &amp; Innovation on September 11, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colorado Springs CoOL Iron Science Teacher|url=http://www.coolscience.org/CoolScience/Teachers/CSCSF2010-IronScience.htm|publisher=Cool Science|accessdate=10-2-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Architecture of Italy}}
'''Italian Baroque architecture''' refers to [[baroque architecture]] in [[Italy]].

==Central Italy==
===Rome===
[[File:Palazzo Barberini at night.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Palazzo Barberini]] at night.]]
The sacred architecture of the Baroque period had its beginnings in the Italian [[paradigm]] of the [[basilica]] with [[crossed dome]] and [[nave]]. One of the first Roman structures to break with the [[Mannerist]] conventions exemplified in [[Church of the Gesu|the Gesù]], was the church of [[Santa Susanna]], designed by [[Carlo Maderno]] in 1596. The dynamic rhythm of columns and pilasters, central massing, and the protrusion and condensed central decoration add complexity to the structure. There is an incipient playfulness with the rules of classic design, still maintaining rigor. They had domed roofs.

The same emphasis on plasticity, continuity and dramatic effects is evident in the work of [[Pietro da Cortona]], illustrated by [[San Luca e Santa Martina]] (1635) and [[Santa Maria della Pace]] (1656). The latter building, with concave wings devised to simulate a theatrical set, presses forward to fill a tiny piazza in front of it. Other Roman ensembles of the period are likewise suffused with theatricality, dominating the surrounding cityscape as a sort of theatrical environment.

Probably the best known example of such an approach is trapezoidal [[Saint Peter's Square]], which has been praised as a masterstroke of Baroque theatre. The square is shaped by two colonnades, designed by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] on an unprecedented colossal scale to suit the space and provide emotions of awe. Bernini's own favourite design was the polychromatic oval church of [[Sant'Andrea al Quirinale]] (1658), which, with its lofty altar and soaring dome, provides a concentrated sampling of the new architecture. His idea of the Baroque townhouse is typified by the [[Palazzo Barberini]] (1629) and [[Palazzo Chigi-Odescalchi]] (1664), both in Rome.

[[File:RomaSIvoSapienzaCupola.jpg|left|thumb|[[Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza]]: [[Francesco Borromini]]]]

Bernini's chief rival in the papal capital was [[Francesco Borromini]], whose designs deviate from the regular compositions of the ancient world and Renaissance even more dramatically. Acclaimed by later generations as a revolutionary in architecture, Borromini condemned the anthropomorphic approach of the 16th century, choosing to base his designs on complicated geometric figures (modules). Borromini's architectural space seems to expand and contract when needed, showing some affinity with the late style of [[Michelangelo]]. His iconic masterpiece is the diminutive church of [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]], distinguished by a corrugated oval plan and complex convex-concave rhythms. A later work, [[Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza]], displays the same antipathy to the flat surface and playful inventiveness, epitomized by a corkscrew lantern dome.

Following the death of Bernini in 1680, [[Carlo Fontana]] emerged as the most influential architect working in [[Rome]]. His early style is exemplified by the slightly concave façade of [[San Marcello al Corso]]). Fontana's academic approach, though lacking in the dazzling inventiveness of his Roman predecessors, exerted substantial influence on Baroque architecture both through his prolific writings and through a number of architects whom he trained and who would disseminate the Baroque idioms throughout 18th-century Europe.

The 18th century saw the capital of Europe's architectural world transferred from Rome to [[Paris]]. The Italian [[Rococo]], which flourished in Rome from the 1720s onward, was profoundly influenced by the ideas of Borromini. The most talented architects active in Rome — [[Francesco de Sanctis (architect)|Francesco de Sanctis]] ([[Spanish Steps]], 1723) and [[Filippo Raguzzini]] ([[Piazza Sant'Ignazio]], 1727) — had little influence outside their native country, as did numerous practitioners of the [[Sicilian Baroque]], including [[Giovanni Battista Vaccarini]], [[Andrea Palma]], and [[Giuseppe Venanzio Marvuglia]].

==Southern Italy==

===Naples===
[[File:Reggia di Caserta.png|right|200px|thumb|The Baroque [[Palace of Caserta]] in [[Caserta]], near Naples.]]
The last phase of Baroque architecture in Italy is exemplified by [[Luigi Vanvitelli]]'s [[Caserta Palace]], reputedly the largest building erected in Europe in the 18th century. Indebted to contemporary French and Spanish models, the palace is skillfully related to the landscape. At Naples and Caserta, Vanvitelli practiced a sober classicizing academic style, with equal attention to [[aesthetics]] and engineering, a style that would make an easy transition to [[Neoclassicism]].

===Sicily===
{{main|Sicilian Baroque}}
[[File:Duomo San Giorgio.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The baroque Duomo of San Giorgio in [[Ragusa, Italy]], on the island of Sicily.]]
[[Sicilian Baroque]] is the distinctive form of [[Baroque architecture]] that took hold on the island of [[Sicily]], off the southern coast of Italy, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The style is recognizable not only by its typical Baroque curves and flourishes, but also by its grinning [[mask]]s and [[putto|putti]] and a particular flamboyance that has given Sicily a unique architectural identity.

The Sicilian Baroque style came to fruition during a major surge of rebuilding following a massive [[1693 Sicily earthquake|earthquake in 1693]]. Previously, the Baroque style had been used on the island in a naïve and [[parochialism|parochial]] manner, having evolved from [[Cross-genre|hybrid]] native architecture rather than being derived from the great Baroque architects of Rome. After the earthquake, local architects, many of them trained in Rome, were given plentiful opportunities to recreate the more sophisticated Baroque architecture that had become popular in mainland Italy; the work of these local architects — and the new genre of architectural [[engraving]]s that they pioneered — inspired more local architects to follow their lead. Around 1730, Sicilian architects had developed a confidence in their use of the Baroque style. Their particular interpretation led to further evolution to a personalised and highly localised art form on the island. From the 1780s onwards, the style was gradually replaced by the newly-fashionable [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassicism]].

The highly decorative Sicilian Baroque period lasted barely fifty years, and perfectly reflected the [[social order]] of the island at a time when, nominally ruled by Spain, it was in fact governed by a wealthy and often extravagant [[aristocracy]] into whose hands ownership of the primarily agricultural economy was highly concentrated. Its Baroque architecture gives the island an architectural character that has lasted into the 21st century.

==North Italy==

===Turin===
[[File:Mg-k Basilica Superga1.jpg|thumb|left|265px|Basilica di Superga near [[Turin]]: [[Filippo Juvarra]]]]
In the north of Italy, notably [[Turin]], the monarchs from the [[House of Savoy]] were particularly receptive to the new style. They employed a brilliant triad of architects—[[Guarino Guarini]], [[Filippo Juvarra]] and [[Bernardo Vittone]]—to illustrate the grandiose political ambitions and the newly acquired royal status of their dynasty.

Guarini was a peripatetic monk who combined many traditions (including that of [[Gothic architecture]]) to create irregular structures remarkable for their oval columns and unconventional façades. Building upon the findings of contemporary geometry and [[stereotomy (architecture)|stereotomy]], Guarini elaborated the concept of ''architectura obliqua'', which approximated Borromini's style in both theoretical and structural audacity. Guarini's [[Palazzo Carignano]] (1679) may have been the most flamboyant application of the Baroque style to the design of a private house in the 17th century.

Fluid forms, weightless details and airy prospects of Juvarra's architecture anticipated the art of [[Rococo]]. Although his practice ranged well beyond [[Turin]], Juvarra's most arresting designs were created for [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia]]. The visual impact of his [[Basilica di Superga]] (1717) derives from its soaring roofline and masterful placement on a hill above Turin. Rustic ambience encouraged a freer articulation of architectural form at the royal hunting lodge of the [[Palazzina di Stupinigi]] (1729). Juvarra finished his short but eventful career in Madrid, where he worked on the royal palaces at [[La Granja (palace)|La Granja]] and [[Palacio Real de Aranjuez|Aranjuez]].

Among the many who were profoundly influenced by the brilliance and diversity of Juvarra and Guarini none was more important than [[Bernardo Vittone]]. This Piedmontese architect is remembered for an outcrop of flamboyant [[Rococo]] churches, quatrefoil in plan and delicate in detailing. His sophisticated designs often feature multiple vaults, structures within structures and domes within domes.

===Milan===
[[File:IMG 4512 - Milano - Palazzo Litta - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto 20-jan 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The baroque [[Palazzo Litta]] in Milan.]]
[[Francesco Maria Richini]] (1584-1658) was the most important [[Milan]]ese architect.&lt;ref name="Diz"&gt;N. Pevsner, J. Fleming, H. Honour, ''Dizionario di architettura'', cit., voce ''Richini, Francesco Maria''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1607 and 1630 he built the Church of [[San Giuseppe (Milan)|San Giuseppe]], which, like [[Chiesa del Gesù]] in Rome, was meant to practice the excess over the Mannerist academic vogue until then.&lt;ref name="Diz"/&gt;
Richini introduced a combined plan, consisting of two central areas derived from Chiesa di [[Sant'Alessandro in Zebedia|Sant' Alessandro]], also in Milan; the plastic effect is also noticeable in the façade, decorated by a series of overlapping niches.

Subsequently, in 1627 he devoted himself to the façade of the [[Palazzo del Senato (Milan)|Collegio Elvetico]] (now the seat of ''Archivio di Stato''), where he aimed at an integration between the interior and exterior through a concave prospectus. This interesting solution, possibly the first curved façade of the Baroque period, predates certain themes later expressed by Borromini, and confirms Richini as one of the greatest architects of the early Baroque.&lt;ref&gt;C. Norberg - Schulz, ''Architettura Barocca'', cit., p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venice===
[[Image:Venedig s maria della salut.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute]], [[Venice]]]]

The Venetian Baroque, according to local practice,&lt;ref&gt;C. Norberg - Schulz, ''Architettura Barocca'', cit., p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; saw Baldassarre Longhena (1598–1682) as its principal exponent.&lt;ref&gt;N. Pevsner, J. Fleming, H. Honour, ''Dizionario di architettura'', cit., voce ''Longhena, Baldassarre''.&lt;/ref&gt; After the pestilence of 1630, he began the construction of the Church of Santa Maria della Salute, using a central plan. In the octagonal body of the basilica, Longhena added a sanctuary bordered on either side by two apses, similar to that adopted by [[Andrea Palladio]] in the Basilica del Santissimo Redentore; this solution strengthens the longitudinal axis of the temple, which in fact became the central body in the proper nave. The baroque style of the temple is evident in the conformation of the external mass, located along the Grand Canal: the octagonal body, covered by a large dome, is flanked by the crown of the shrine and two bell towers.

Longhena also worked within civic architecture: its [[Ca' Pesaro]] presents a seemingly conventional plan, but the play of light and shadows that are set on the richly ornate façade leads to a typically Baroque style.

In any case, the exasperation of Loghena's [[plastic arts|plastic art details]] peaked in the façade of Chiesa dell'Ospedaletto (completed in the 1670s), decorated with a fancifully and richly with atlantes, giant heads and lion masks.

===Genoa===
In Genoa, Baroque architecture, since the end of the 16th century, saw the construction of a series of large buildings that critics have deemed among the most important of the Italian landscape.&lt;ref&gt;N. Pevsner, J. Fleming, H. Honour, ''Dizionario di architettura'', cit., voce ''Italia''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these was the [[Palazzo Doria Tursi]], where the planimetric configuration of the vestibule, combined with the highest indoor garden through a wide staircase, declares the presence of a movement in depth.

This solution was taken up by [[Bartolomeo Bianco]] (1590 - 1657) in what may be considered his masterpiece:&lt;ref&gt;C. Norberg - Schulz, ''Architettura Barocca'', cit., p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; the college of the Jesuits, which later became the headquarters of the [[University of Genoa]] (1634, approximately). The building has a U-shaped plan, but compared to previous one shows greater permeability between the inside and the yard; in fact, using the conformation of the very steep terrain, Bianco created a unique urban scenery, with a porch as wide as the yard and a series of overlapping arches and stairways.

Le courrier des lecteurs dénote l'intérêt des professionnels, qu'ils soient à l'inspection des [[Monument historique (France)|monuments historiques]] (tel Olivier Poisson&lt;ref&gt;Courrier, ''Courrier d’Olivier Poisson, en réaction à la brève du 8/10/05 à propos des architectes des monuments historiques'', La Tribune de l'art, 16 octobre 2005 [http://www.latribunedelart.com/courrier-d-olivier-poisson-en-reaction-a-la-breve-du-8-10-05-a-propos-des-architectes-des-monuments-historiques-article001751.html lire en ligne] (page consultée le 31 mars 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref&gt;Courrier, ''Réponse d’Olivier Poisson aux derniers arguments d’Anne Vuillemard et de Didier Rykner'', La Tribune de l'art, 26 octobre 2005 [http://www.latribunedelart.com/reponse-d-olivier-poisson-aux-derniers-arguments-d-anne-vuillemard-et-de-didier-rykner-article001755.html lire en ligne] (page consultée le 31 mars 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;) ou à de hauts postes de conservation (comme Pierre Arizzoli-Clémentel, ancien directeur du [[Château de Versailles|château et domaine de Versailles]]&lt;ref&gt;Courrier, ''Courrier de Monsieur Pierre Arizzoli-Clémentel, suite à notre article sur Versailles'', La Tribune de l'art, 12 avril 2007 [http://www.latribunedelart.com/courrier-de-monsieur-pierre-arizzoli-clementel-suite-a-notre-article-sur-versailles-article002234.html lire en ligne] (page consultée le 31 mars 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref&gt;Monsieur Arizzoli-Clémentel a été nommé depuis président de la commission du musée du Luxembourg (juillet 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;).

Le caractère incisif des éditoriaux du directeur de publication, par ailleurs [[rédacteur en chef]] du magazine, est très régulièrement souligné&lt;ref name="Monde"/&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref&gt;Actualités, ''Didier Rykner : Le tribun de l’art'', [[Le Nouvel Observateur]], n° 2413, 3 février 2011&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref&gt;François Dufay, ''Les folies de Versailles'', [[Le Point]], 5 avril 2007 [http://www.lepoint.fr/culture/les-folies-de-versailles/249/0/177601 lire en ligne] (page consultée le 28 mars 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;.

Il lui arrive d'être le premier à souligner, voire à publier, des informations sensibles comme la mise en vente (retirée ''in extremis'') chez [[Sotheby's]] d'un [[Edgar Degas|Degas]] volé&lt;ref&gt;Harry Bellet, ''Le mystère de la blanchisseuse'', Le Monde, 18 novembre 2010 [http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=1140663 lire en ligne (sur abonnément)] (page consultée le 28 mars 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; ou, plus notablement, le projet controversé de [[Contrat de bail|location]] par l'État de l'[[hôtel de la Marine]], édifice classé situé [[place de la Concorde]] à Paris&lt;ref&gt;Didier Rykner, ''L’État va-t-il se débarrasser de l’Hôtel de la Marine ?'', éditorial du 23 février 2009 [http://www.latribunedelart.com/l-etat-va-t-il-se-debarrasser-de-l-hotel-de-la-marine-article001515.html lire en ligne] (page consultée le 28 mars 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Lentisphaerae''' is a [[phylum]] of [[bacteria]] closely related to [[Chlamydiae]] and [[Verrucomicrobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cho J, Vergin K, Morris R, Giovannoni S | title = Lentisphaera araneosa gen. nov., sp. nov, a transparent exopolymer producing marine bacterium, and the description of a novel bacterial phylum, Lentisphaerae | journal = Environ Microbiol | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 611–21 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15142250 | doi = 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2004.00614.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20962908"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Limam RD, Bouchez T, Chouari R, etal |title=Detection of WWE2-related Lentisphaerae by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization in landfill leachate |journal=Can.

It includes two monotypic orders [[Lentisphaerales]] and [[Victivallales]].  Phylum members can be [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] or [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] and fall under two distinct phenotypes.  One consists of terrestrial gut microbiota from mammals and birds.  The other phenotype includes marine micro-organisms: sequences from fish and coral microbiomes and marine sediment.

'''Melody type''' or '''type-melody'''&lt;ref&gt;David Hiley. ''Western Plainchant. A Handbook''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993, pp.&amp;nbsp;331–33.&lt;/ref&gt; is a set of [[melody|melodic]] formulas, [[figure (music)|figures]], and [[melodic pattern|patterns]].

== Term and typical meanings ==
"Melody type" is a fundamental notion for understanding a nature of Western and non-Western musical [[Mode (music)|modes]], according to [[Harold Powers|Harold Powers']] seminal article "Mode" in the first edition of the ''[[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' {{harv|Powers|1980|loc=12:376–77, 379, et passim}}.

Melody types are used in the [[musical composition|composition]] of an enormous variety of [[music]], especially [[music of Asia|non-Western]] and [[early music|early Western music]]. Such music is generally composed by a process of [[centonization]], either freely (i.e. improvised) or in a fixed pattern.

"Melody type" as used by the ethmnomusicologist [[Mark Slobin|Mark]] {{harvtxt|Slobin|1982|loc=186}}&lt;ref&gt;Slobin, Mark (1982). ''Tenement Songs: The Popular Music of the Jewish Immigrants''. Music in American Life. Urbana: University of Illinois Press. {{ISBN|0-252-00893-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is defined as a "group of melodies that are related, in that they all contain similar modal procedures and characteristic [[rhythm]]ic and melodic contours or patterns".&lt;ref&gt;Koskoff, Ellen (2000). ''Music in Lubavitcher Life'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press), p.&amp;nbsp;86. {{ISBN|978-0-252-02591-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most cultures which compose music in this way organize the patterns into distinct melody types. These are often compared to modern Western [[musical scale|scale]]s, but they in fact represent much more information than a sequence of permissible [[pitch (music)|pitches]], since they include how those pitches should function in the music, and indicate basic formulas which serve as a basis for [[improvisation]]. In non-improvised music, such as codified liturgical music, it is still usually clear how the melody developed from set patterns.

{{quote|On one end of the continuum, the right, the melody type is a schema that is quite definite—a specific melody or a tune. When a musician improvises on this schema, he [or she] plays the melody with only slight variations. The basic outline is preserved and is clearly recognized by the listener. The best example&amp;nbsp;... on this end of the continuum is a folk song. A genuine folk song performance is a kind of improvisation. No one person sings it exactly as it came to him [or her]. One of the challenges of folk song research, of course, is to find all the variants of the tune and to try to trace the family relationships.&lt;br/&gt; On the left side of the continuum is the melody type as a [[musical mode|mode]]. Here the melody type is similar to a [[Gregorian mode|church mode]]: a scalar configuration with a preferential order of tones.&lt;br/&gt; ...The closer we get to the pole where a melody type is a tune, the more definite and literal is the schema.|May (1983)&lt;ref&gt;May, Elizabeth (1983). ''Musics of Many Cultures: An Introduction, Part 1'', p.&amp;nbsp;274. {{ISBN|978-0-520-04778-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|A melodic formula, ranging length from a short motif of a few notes to an entire melody, which is used as the basis for musical compositions. It differs from a mode, which simply sets forth a sequence of [[interval (music)|intervals]] (in Western music, half tones and whole tones), and from a scale (the notes of a mode in rising order of pitch), in that it is more specific: a melody type spells out actual sequences of tones, just as they are to appear in a piece, as well as particular beginnings and endings, [[ornament (music)|ornaments]], and other details. Melody types are found mostly in the music of ancient peoples—the Greeks, Hebrews, and others—and of Eastern peoples—the Arabs, Persians (Iranians), Indians, and others. For...example...[[raga]].|Ammer (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Ammer, Christine (2004). "Melody type", ''The Facts on File Dictionary of Music'', p.&amp;nbsp;238. {{ISBN|978-0-8160-5266-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Melodic formulae and melody types in monodic traditions around the world ==
* [[Nomos (music)|Nomos]] in [[Music of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek music]]
[[File:Formulae tonorum.jpg|thumb|400px|Ancient type-melodies for 8 church ('Gregorian') tones. Transcribed from the South-French tonary of the 10th century (Ms.: F-Pn lat.&amp;nbsp;1121, fol.&amp;nbsp;201v-205v). Pseudo-liturgical verses with initial numerals (''primum..., secundum..., tertia...'' etc.) helped singers to associate a current model with a 'real' chant (such as antiphon) of the same tone. These type-melodies were probably conceived as didactic, to adjust ear for typical melodic formulae, reciting tones, finals etc. They should not be confused with psalm tones, which represent an exact scheme for modulating psalms and canticles.&lt;ref&gt;David Hiley, ''Western Plainchant: A Handbook'' (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1993): pp.&amp;nbsp;58-69 and pp.&amp;nbsp;331-335; this handbook is itself a summary of specialized studies of intonation formulas by Michel Huglo, Terence Bailey, [[Bruno Stäblein]], and many others referred to at pp.&amp;nbsp;58 and 325 et passim. See also: Fiona McAlpine, ''Tonal Consciousness and the Medieval West'' (Bern: Peter Lang, 2008): p.&amp;nbsp;112.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
* Intonation formula ({{lang-lat|intonatio}}, [[euouae]], Noeane etc.) in [[Gregorian chant]] as used in [[psalm tone]]s and certain genres such as the [[Tract (liturgy)|Tract]]&lt;ref&gt;''Bailey T.'' The Intonation Formulas of Western Chant. Toronto, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Echos|Enechema]] ({{lang-grc|ἐνήχημα}}) in [[Byzantine chant]]
* Popevka ({{lang-rus|попевка}}) in [[Znamennoe singing|Znamenny chant]]
* [[Khaz (notation)|Khaz]] in [[Armenian chant]]
&lt;!-- * ?? in the system of Jewish [[cantillation]] --&gt;
* All Near and Middle East maqam-traditions ([[Arabic maqam|Arabic Maqam]], [[Makam|Turkish Makam]], [[Meqam|Kurdish Meqam]], [[Muqam|Uyghur Muqam]], [[Mugam|Azeri Mugam]], [[Shashmakom|Uzbek and Tadzhik Shashmakom]],  [[Dastgah|Persian Dastgah]] etc.)
* [[Raga]] in [[Music of India|Indian music]] 
* [[Pathet]] in [[Indonesian music]]
* [[Choshi (music)|Chōshi]] in [[Japanese music]]
&lt;!-- * [[Risqolo]] in [[Syrian music]] --&gt;

==Extra-musical implications==
In most cases, these melody types are associated with extra-musical implications, particularly [[emotion]]s (see Indian [[rasa (art)|rasa]], for instance). They are also often associated with certain times. For example, most [[raga]]s are associated with a certain time of day, or a [[wayang]] performance in Java implies a certain succession of [[pathet]]s.

Many of these traditions have a corresponding rhythmic framework. These include:
* [[Usul (music)|Usul]] in Arabian and Turkish music
* [[Tala (music)|Tala]] in Indian music
* [[Bentuk]] in Javanese music

Mireia Boya Busquet has been a fighter for the recognition of [[Val d'Aran|Occitan]] identity of the Valley of Aran, and was the first member of the Catalan Parliament to use the [[Aranese dialect]] in the [[Parliament of Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.esdiario.com/895533049/Rozando-el-esperpento-la-nueva-diputada-de-CUP-solo-hablara-en-aranes.html |title=Rozando el esperpento: la nueva diputada de CUP sólo hablará en aranés |trans-title=Grazing the Grotesque: The New CUP Deputy Will Only Speak in Aranese |work=ESDiario.com |language=Spanish |date=20 January 2016 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother, {{ill|Jusèp Boya Busquet|es}}, has been general director of Archives, Libraries, Museum, and Heritage of the Generalitat beginning in January 2016, an office that he was dismissed from after the 2017 suspension of Catalonian self-government.

==Political career==
Boya is a founder and former coordinator of the [[Assemblea Nacional Catalana]] in Val d'Aran and councilor in the city of [[Les, Catalonia|Les]] for the [[Corròp]] party, framed in [[Occitan nationalism]]. In the [[Catalan regional election, 2015|2015 elections to the Parliament of Catalonia]], she was a candidate of the [[Popular Unity Candidacy|CUP]] for the district of [[Province of Lleida|Lleida]], after a vote in primaries. Boya, who was second in the list in her constituency, was not elected, but on 18 December 2015, during the tense negotiations between the CUP and the pro-independence coalition [[Junts pel Sí]], the CUP's number one, Ramon Usall, resigned for personal reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20151219/30915108732/diputado-cup-renuncia-ramon-usall.html |title=Voto secreto en la asamblea de la CUP para decidir si se inviste a Artur Mas |trans-title=Secret Vote in the CUP Assembly to Decide Whether to Invest Artur Mas |first=Àlex |last=Tort |work=[[La Vanguardia]] |language=Spanish |date=19 December 2015 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, Boya occupied the post of regional parliamentarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.naciodigital.cat/lleida/noticia/16111/mireia/boya/sera/diputada/cup/substitucio/ramon/usall |title=Mireia Boya serà diputada de la CUP en substitució de Ramon Usall |trans-title=Mireia Boya to be CUP Deputy as Substitute for Ramon Usall |first=Àlvar |last=Llobet |work=Nació Digital |language=Catalan |date=10 January 2016 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.jornalet.com/nova/5499/una-occitanista-aranesa-candidata-al-parlament-de-catalonha-per-la-cup |title=Una occitanista aranesa candidata al Parlament de Catalonha per la CUP |trans-title=An Occitan Aranese Candidate for the Parliament of Catalonia for the CUP |work=Jornalet |language=Catalan |date=31 July 2015 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She participated in the plenary sessions of the Parliament that voted for the roadmap to independence for Catalonia, and voted the Unilateral declaration of Independence of Catalonia.

In the elections of 21 December 2017, of the 5,265 votes cast in Val d'Aran, the CUP received 174 – 3.3% of the total.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://resultados.elpais.com/elecciones/2017/autonomicas/09/25-39.html |title=Resultados Electorales en Aran: Elecciones Cataluña 2017 |trans-title=Electoral Results in Aran: Catalan Elections 2017 |work=[[El País]] |language=Spanish |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occitan nationalism===
A defender of the [[Occitania|Occitan nation]], Boya upholds a "project of a country with two languages of its own", a country that looks "to the north, to Occitania".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20160120/301542079265/diputada-cup-aranes-parlament.html |title=La nueva diputada de la CUP sólo hablará en aranés en la tribuna |trans-title=The New CUP Deputy Will Only Speak in Aranese at the Rostrum |first=Quico |last=Sallés |work=[[La Vanguardia]] |location=Barcelona |language=Spanish |date=20 January 2016 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mock language''' is a term in [[linguistic anthropology]] for the intentional use of a language not spoken by or native to the speaker that is used to reinforce the speaker's [[language ideology]] of the hegemonic language.

When talking, the speaker includes words or phrases from other languages that they think fit into the conversation. The term "[[Mock Spanish]]" was popularized in the 1990s by [[Jane H. Hill]], a linguist at the [[University of Arizona]], mock Spanish is the most common form of mock language in the southwestern [[United States]], where Hill first researched the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://language-culture.binghamton.edu/symposia/2/part1/|title=Mock Spanish: A Site For The Indexical Reproduction Of Racism In American English|last=Hill|first=Jane H.|date=|website=language-culture.binghamton.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Mock" has since been applied to other languages, and the [[umbrella term]] "Mock language" developed. Mock language is commonly viewed as a form of appropriation. In the United States, the most common form is mock Spanish. However, globally, mock language is used to share meaning between the speaker and audience about the speech community the speaker is mocking.

== Definition ==
The speaker is unintentionally indexing a [[language ideology]] that all Americans should speak English or that other languages are secondary in the US. Using words outside the speaker's native language neglects context of the conversion, meaning of the word or phrase, or conceptual knowledge including historical injustices to the borrowed language, culture, and physical surroundings. It is a borrowing words in different languages and using it in your context.

When using mock language, the speaker is showing their '[[cosmopolitanism]]' or global knowledge. One dominant language ideology is that English should be the only language spoken in the United States, establishing English as a hegemonic language. This [[hegemony]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=3uxHCFOrEjwC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=Lull,+J.+(2000).+Media,+communication,+culture:+A+global+approach+(2nd+ed.).+New+York:+Columbia+University+Press&amp;ots=JARfcJrcB6&amp;sig=ejH_hZjCuDYZ_TAtfVqbdYYQpwc#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Media, Communication, Culture: A Global Approach|last=Lull|first=James|date=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231120739|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; creates a dominance of the hegemonic group over the ones that have not conformed. Mock language reinforces this, as it takes language and culture out of context to show the speaker's worldly knowledge, but does not celebrate or intellectually use the language. This ideology is actually maintaining the subordinate status of the other languages used as the language speakers in that community are expected to speak English and not in a mocking way.

For the opposing perspective, saying that using other languages in an English conversation is supportive of that language, it does not show awareness of the cultural or social meanings behind the words spoken.  
 
== History, Theorists, and Contributors ==
The term "Mock Spanish" was popularized in the 1990s by linguistic anthropologist Jane H. Hill. This led to other languages being referred to as "Mock-Languages." Increasing globalization in modern history has contributed significantly to the spreading and study of Mock-Language in linguistic anthropology. Globalization has occurred at an exponential rate through numerous media—such as television and social networking applications—during the turn of the 21st century. With globalization, more languages are being encountered in daily interactions, and more people are able to travel. To show this global perspective, it is common to incorporate words of different languages into your native language, thus mock language.

Hill analyzes the 'inner sphere' and 'outer spheres' in which Puerto Ricans living in [[New York City|New York]] uses their [[Multilingualism|bilingualism]]. In the inner sphere of neighborhood and intimates such as family and close friends, the boundaries between English and Spanish are blurred formally and functionally. However, in the outer sphere with strangers or government officials, the usage of Spanish becomes [[Markedness|marked]] and "sharply objectified" to the point where the boundaries are so distinct that bilingual speakers may become too scared to speak at all.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=Jane|date=|title=Language, Race, and White Public Space|url=https://www-jstor-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/stable/682046?pq-origsite=summon|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=100 (No. 3)|pages=680–689|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows the hegemonic power of English and how Spanish speakers feel vulnerable and powerless to use Spanish. The need for perfect English is absolute, yet when English speakers dabble in Spanish in this mocking way, there is no nervousness, as their agency extends beyond English hegemony and into the power an English speaker holds in American society. Hill also discusses how [[semantic domain]]s index a state.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Saying something is "el cheapo" indexes that Spanish speakers do not have money or commonly buy cheap, crappy goods.

In a more recent study of Mock White Girl, researcher Tyanna Slobe explains how it is a hegemonic representation of a language being dominated than another and how people would to try to identify with that race by saying a combination of words in that language. “...complicating the moralizing gaze with which linguists have approached mock as uniformly reproducing white supremacist ideologies.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slobe|first=Tyanna|date=2018|title=Style, Stance, and Social Meaning in Mock White Girl|url=|journal=Language in Society|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the performance piece that people want others to portray themselves to why they would speak this way.

Mock white girl shows how the intentional use of [[Vocal fry register|vocal fry]] to convey a mockery of the white, upper-class, suburban, spoiled young adult or teenager is conveying a shared meaning that the language the speaker is mocking is subordinate and not to be taken seriously. It indexes the characteristics of a stereotypical white girl and uses the n+1 level of indexicality for the public to make the connection between the mockery and the speech community.

Another semantic domain is language crossing. “Language crossing involves code alternation by people who are not accepted members of the group associated with the second language that they are using (code switching into varieties that are not generally thought to belong to them). This kind of switching involves a distinct sense of movement across social or ethnic boundaries and it raises issues of legitimacy which, in one way or another, participants need to negotiate in the course of their encounter.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rampton|first=Ben|date=1995-12-01|title=Language crossing and the problematisation of ethnicity and socialisation|url=http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/prag.5.4.04ram|journal=Pragmatics. Quarterly Publication of the International Pragmatics Association (IPrA)|language=en|volume=5|issue=4|pages=485–513|doi=10.1075/prag.5.4.04ram|issn=1018-2101|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to mock language as the people code alternating are not members of the group, similar to how mock-language speakers are English speakers not members of the language they are mocking.

== Implications of Study ==
Mock language is used in [[anthropology]] and [[linguistics]] to interpret different languages in a conversation and the characteristics of borrowing words from a language. It is important to study mock language in order to preserve the original foundations of languages or dialects that have become subject to the pressure of globalization. Each time a mock phrase is used, it reinforces the divergence from the original language. Globalization occurs at a much faster rate today than in the past, largely due to technological advancements that connect the world with no regard for national borders. American culture is overwhelmingly dominant in the field of online media, and American interpretations of other cultures often become somewhat of a universal standard, at least in terms of exposure. This makes it important for linguists to analyze such interpretations and recognize their origins.

The study of Mock Language also reveals several powerful racial ideologies in the way English speakers hold agency to use other languages carelessly. “It is certainly useful to think of linguistic signs as being bound to historical contexts. But a limited historical view of language fails to address the fact that speakers are often not aware of the historical references they make by using particular signs.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chun|first=Elaine W.|date=June 2001|title=The Construction of White, Black, and Korean American Identities through African American Vernacular English|url=https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1525/jlin.2001.11.1.52|journal=Journal of Linguistic Anthropology|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=52–64|doi=10.1525/jlin.2001.11.1.52|issn=1055-1360|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a general ignorance, mostly from the perspective of English speakers, regarding the use of certain phrases. Misuses of certain words can eventually be attributed to legitimate cultures after overuse, especially with the help of modern media as a medium of exposure, undermining history and often introducing the possibility of offending native speakers.

== Controversy ==
In the United States, the dominant language ideology is that English should be the official language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/lifestyle/general_lifestyle/april_2018/americans_strongly_favor_english_as_official_language|title=Americans Strongly Favor English as Official Language|last=|first=|date=2018-04-26|website=Rasmussen Reports|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racial minorities are treated adversely than whites, and their languages are not perceived as “American”.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} There are many social, economic, environmental disadvantages of minority groups. The dominant ideology does not allow these groups to celebrate their language, yet “mock language involves borrowings and wordplay by speakers who require little comprehension of the other language.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vessey|first=Rachelle|date=2014|title=Borrowed words, mock language and nationalism in Canada|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14708477.2013.863905|journal=Language and Intercultural Communication|volume=14|issue=2|pages=176–190|doi=10.1080/14708477.2013.863905|issn=1470-8477|eissn=1747-759X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mock language reinforces the status and social differences of native English speakers versus minorities and ethnic communities.

== Features of Mock Language ==
[[File:Namaste in bed.jpg|thumb|People usually wear this shirt to indicate that they are going to yoga or going to sleep to promote laziness and zen with the language Hindi.It creates a pun through code switching, but the Hindi word is not actually associated with yoga.]]
While not every use of mock language is the same, aspects such as gendered indicators, greetings, and pronouns are commonly used. It may come about without the intention of knowing the harm for that language's speech community. Mock Spanish commonly uses gendered [[pronoun]]s of 'el', 'la', and adds '-o' to the end of words.

Mock-white girl is a type of mock language that is inspired by the stereotypical "white girl's" vernacular. It commonly uses features such as 'like' in excess to imply the speaker is not well spoken or articulate. It also features [[uptalk]], [[creaky voice]], blondness and the stereotypical association with [[Starbucks]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Mock-Hindi has taken the word 'namaste' out of context singularly and does not borrow other words or linguistic features from the language. While these are all very different mock languages features, they all do not respect the original languages and highlight the language ideology of English dominance in the US. Additionally, it does not [[Code Switch|code switch]] between the two languages, a linguistic term for switching between two languages the speaker knows, as the speaker clearly does not know [[Hindi]] when using it in such a context. 
  
== Mock Spanish ==
It has been adapted in society for people to code switch between languages but there is a boundary where "speaking" the language is inauthentic and distasteful. People tend to say "el" or add an "o" at the end of words as if they are speaking mock Spanish such as el cheapo, no problemo. The semantic domain is cheapness and it suggests that Spanish speakers have a limited amount of money and like to get things that are lower quality and low-priced.

“Mock Spanish relies upon the semiotic construction of two basic social types: the easygoing, humorous, and somewhat cosmopolitan white person and the lazy, dirty, sexually “loose,” and unintelligent Spanish speaker.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roth-Gordon|first=Jennifer|date=2011-11-24|title=Discipline and Disorder in the Whiteness of Mock Spanish1|url=https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2011.01107.x|journal=Journal of Linguistic Anthropology|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|pages=211–229|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1395.2011.01107.x|issn=1055-1360}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- More needed. Can you outline all the rules that Hill noticed? --&gt; &lt;!-- Did you guys read Hill's "Mock Spanish: A site for the indexical reproduction of racism in American English"? Here she gives all of the features and she explains the use of Mock Spanish in terms of creating "semantic domains." As long as you cite it properly, you can include all of her findings. --&gt;

== Examples ==
[[File:Danke Sign.jpg|thumb|Danke Sign: This sign shows the business's affiliation to Germany. While trying to teach the English speaking viewers a German word, it does not provide any pronunciation guides or context.|227x227px]]Popular T-shirts for young women with the saying "[[namaste]] in bed". This borrows the traditional greeting from [[Hindi]] and makes it into a pun of the slang term "imma stay in bed". It also associates the Hindi word as a [[yoga]] term, though this is misappropriation as it is a term used for greeting, not concluding a yoga session. It is in relation to being lazy.

[[Cinco de Mayo]], a holiday that celebrates Mexico’s defeat of the French on May 5, 1862, has become extremely popular in the United States as a celebration based largely on the consumption of alcohol. Due to this association, the term “[[Cinco de Drinko]]” has emerged, representing both ignorance toward the holiday’s history and an example of the “add ‘o’” phenomenon. The “add ‘o’” phenomenon is the practice of English speakers adding an “o” to the end of an English word in order to give it the false appeal of being a Spanish word.

YouTuber “[[Louise Pentland|Sprinkle of Glitter]]” would open videos until 2017 saying “Aloha Sprinklerinos”. While not only making up a word for the name of her follower base, she used mock Hawaiian; dropping in what she perceived as a fun, innocent greeting without knowing anything about Hawaiian language, culture, context in which Hawaiians say and use the word aloha, and historical inequalities facing Hawaiians.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ec_geALd1A&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mock White Girl" is a common example that is seen in movies where the girls are speaking in standard English with creaky voice and are trying to be portrayed as privileged, popular, and in power. In the 2004 film ''[[Mean Girls]],'' character Regina George is known to be the most popular girl in school and throughout the movie she has the voice for people to recognize her status.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAOmTMCtGkI&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mock german.jpg|thumb|'Das Boot' mocks the German language for English speaking marketing purposes as "boot" does not translate into a type of footwear but to 'boat' in English. This shows the semantic domain which associates anything German with a drinking culture.]]
Bars and pubs around the world have signs that try to imitate European bar and pub culture. Oftentimes, German is incorporated due to the association of German culture with drinking. This decontextualization and use of stereotype is mock language. Danke is German for "thank you", but it is decontextualized in an English-speaking environment.

The signs are using German as an international language of beer or drinking, but "das boot" in German translates as “the boat” and has nothing to do with shoes or drinking. Nevertheless, it is used as the name of a drink represented by footwear. Using 'danke' in a pub may show knowledge of a direct translation, however it stereotypes drinking beer with German culture and language.

This test calls for a sample of the material in question to be placed in an airtight container with three [[Coupon (materials science)|coupons]] of different metals—[[silver]], [[lead]], and [[copper]]—that are not touching each other or the sample of the material.&lt;ref&gt;Schiro,Mara "Oddy Test Protocols" http://www.conservation-wiki.com/index.php?title=Oddy_Test_Protocols&amp;oldid=4830 Accessed February 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The container is sealed with a small amount of de-ionized water to maintain a high [[humidity]], then heated at 60 degrees [[Celsius]] for 28 days. An identical container with three metal coupons acts as a [[Scientific control|control]]. If the metal coupons show no signs of [[corrosion]], then the material is deemed suitable to be placed in and around art objects. The Oddy test is not a contact test, but is for testing [[outgassing|off-gassing]].
[[File:Oddy-test-color.jpg|thumb|A basic layout of a three-in-one Oddy Test]]
Each metal detects a different set of [[corrosive substance|corrosive agents]]. The silver is for detecting reduced sulfur compounds and [[carbonyl sulfide]]s. The lead is for detecting organic acids, [[aldehyde]], and acidic gases. The copper is for detecting [[chloride]], oxide, and sulfur compounds.

There are many types of [[materials testing]] for other purposes, including [[chemical test]]ing and [[physical test]]ing.

==Development==
The Oddy test has gone through many changes and refinements over time. Whereas Andrew Oddy proposed to place each metal coupon in a separate glass container with the material to be tested, Bamberger et al.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Conservation, Vol. 44, No. 2 (1999), pp. 86-90.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a "three-in-one" test, where all three metal coupons shared one container, simplifying the procedure. Robinett and Thickett (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Conservation, Vol. 48, No. 4 (2003), pp. 263-268.&lt;/ref&gt; refined the "three-in-one" test by stabilizing the metal coupons.

One of the main issues with the Oddy test is that there is some subjectivity to the interpretation of the results,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-43/standard-materials-for-corrosiveness-testing/&lt;/ref&gt; since it is primarily a visual determination.
[[File:Oddy-tests 0823b.jpg|thumb|Oddy-tests 0823b]]

Institutions that use the Oddy test in their research are mainly art museums such as The [[J. Paul Getty Museum]], [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art|The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

'''Oswald Jonas''' (January 10, 1897 – March 19, 1978) was a music theorist and [[musicologist]] and student of [[Heinrich Schenker]]. Despite Schenker's conservative nationalist views Jonas was an admirer of [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]].

In 1935, Jonas founded the '''Schenker Institut''' and began publishing ''Der Dreiklang'' with [[Felix Salzer]]. The '''Oswald Jonas Memorial Collection''', housed at the [[University of California, Riverside]] Library, holds the complete diaries of Schenker and much of the correspondence and manuscripts of [[Erwin Ratz]], Jonas's first student. His primary students include Felix Salzer, Ernst Oster, and [[Sylvan Kalib]].

In [[programming language theory]], the '''POPLmark challenge''' (from "Principles of Programming Languages benchmark", formerly '''Mechanized Metatheory for the Masses!''') (Aydemir, 2005) is a set of [[Benchmarking|benchmarks]] designed to evaluate the state of [[automated reasoning]] (or mechanization) in the [[metatheory]] of programming languages, and to stimulate discussion and collaboration among a diverse cross section of the [[formal methods]] community. Very loosely speaking, the challenge is about measurement of how well programs may be proven to match a specification of how they are intended to behave (and the many complex issues that this involves). The challenge was initially proposed by the members of the ''PL club'' at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], in association with collaborators around the world. The ''Workshop on Mechanized Metatheory'' is the main meeting of researchers participating in the challenge.

The design of the POPLmark benchmark is guided by features common to reasoning about programming languages. The challenge problems do not require the formalisation of large programming languages, but they do require sophistication in reasoning about:

; [[Name binding|Binding]] : Most programming languages have some form of binding, ranging in complexity from the simple binders of [[simply typed lambda calculus]] to complex, potentially infinite binders needed in the treatment of [[record (computer science)|record]] [[pattern matching|pattern]]s.
; [[Mathematical induction|Induction]] : Properties such as [[subject reduction]] and [[strong normalisation]] often require complex induction arguments.
; Reuse : Furthering collaboration being a key aim of the challenge, the solutions are expected to contain reusable components that would allow researchers to share language features and designs without requiring them to start from scratch every time.

== The problems ==

{{As of|2007}}, the POPLmark challenge is composed of three parts. Part 1 concerns solely the types of [[system F-sub|System F&lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;:&lt;/sub&gt;]] ([[System F]] with [[subtyping]]), and has problems such as:
# Checking that the type system admits [[transitive relation|transitivity]] of subtyping.
# Checking the transitivity of subtyping in the presence of [[record (computer science)|record]]s

Part 2 concerns the syntax and semantics of System F&lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;:&lt;/sub&gt;. It concerns proofs of
# [[Type safety]] for the pure fragment
# Type safety in the presence of [[pattern matching]]

Part 3 concerns the usability of the formalisation of System F&lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;:&lt;/sub&gt;. In particular, the challenge asks for:
# Simulating and animating the [[operational semantics]]
# Extracting useful algorithms from the formalisations

Several solutions have been proposed for parts of the POPLmark challenge, using following tools: [[Isabelle theorem prover|Isabelle/HOL]], [[Twelf]], [[Coq]], [http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jcheney/programs/aprolog/ αProlog], [[ATS (programming language)|ATS]], [http://abella.cs.umn.edu/ Abella] and [[Matita proof assistant|Matita]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "shoestring organization" with "offices mainly on [Joseph J. Mangano's] kitchen table"&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; was established to examine the relationships between low-level nuclear radiation and public health and question the [[Nuclear safety in the United States|safety of nuclear power]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

As of November 2010, Radiation and Public Health Project members have published 27 medical journal articles on health risks from radioactive exposures to nuclear reactors and weapons tests.  RPHP studies have claimed elevated rates of childhood, thyroid, and other cancers near reactors.

According to a 2003 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', the group's work has been controversial, and had little credibility with the scientific establishment.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Similarly the work of the Radiation and Public Health Project has been criticized by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission:&lt;ref name="NRC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/tooth-fairy.html|title=Backgrounder on Radiation Protection and the "Tooth Fairy" Issue|publisher=U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission|date=2010-02-17|accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Numerous peer-reviewed scientific studies do not support the RPHP's claims. NRC finds there is little or no credibility in the RHP's studies". In an April 2014 article in Popular Science, Sarah Epstein referred to the group's work as "[[junk science]]" and disputed the group's peer-reviewed publications as being insufficiently evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/what-can-we-do-about-junk-science-16674140|title=What Can We Do About Junk Science|date=2014-04-08|publisher=Popular Science|author=Sarah Epstein|accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Baby teeth ==
A set of 85,000 teeth that had been collected by Dr. [[Louise Reiss]] and her colleagues as part of the [[Baby Tooth Survey]] were uncovered in 2001 and given to the Radiation and Public health Project. By tracking the individuals who had participated in the tooth-collection project, the RHPR published results in a 2010 issue of the ''International Journal of Health Service'' that claimed that those children who later died of cancer before the age of 50 had levels of [[strontium 90]] in their stored baby teeth that was twice the level of those who were still alive at 50.&lt;ref&gt;Hevesi, Dennis. [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/science/10reiss.html "Dr. Louise Reiss, Who Helped Ban Atomic Testing, Dies at 90"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 10, 2011. Accessed January 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wald, Matthew L. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/14/health/14cancer.html "Study of Baby Teeth Sees Radiation Effects"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 13, 2010. Accessed January 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This paper was criticized by Stephen Musolino, a health physicist and specialist in radiation protection at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], as it "confuses [[correlation]] with [[Causality|causation]]" and in their opinion the authors of the paper are "ice-cream [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/health/decades-later-baby-tooth-survey-legacy-lives-on/article_c5ad9492-fd75-5aed-897f-850fbdba24ee.html Decades later, Baby Tooth Survey legacy lives on By JEFFREY TOMICH  Aug 1, 2013. St.Louis Post-Dispatch]&lt;/ref&gt;

RPHP studied 5,000 [[baby teeth]], the results of which were published in 5 medical journal articles.  High and rising levels of [[strontium-90]] in baby teeth were found near reactors.

The [[National Cancer Institute]], [[National Institutes of Health]], [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] and nuclear industry groups responded with statements that the study was flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nei.org/resourcesandstats/documentlibrary/safetyandsecurity/factsheet/scienceonradiationhealtheffectsdispelstoothfairyproject/|title=Peer-Reviewed Science on Radiation Health Effects Dispels ‘Tooth Fairy Project’|date=August 2010|publisher=[[Nuclear Energy Institute]]|accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The groups stated that the study suffered from small sample sizes; no control populations; no other cancer risk factors considered; no environmental sampling and analysis; [[cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]] of data to fit the conclusion; and an incorrect [[half-life]] used for strontium-90. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has not changed its opinion that there is no excess cancer risk from living near nuclear facilities.&lt;ref name="NRC" /&gt;

== Fukushima ==
After the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima disaster]], Mangano and Sherman published several articles claiming detrimental health effects in America caused by fallout from Japan:

In a June 2011 article in [[CounterPunch]], they claimed a 35% increase in infant mortality on the West coast of the United States in the 10 weeks after the disaster, vs the 4 weeks prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/06/10/is-the-increase-in-baby-deaths-in-the-us-a-result-of-fukushima-fallout/print|title=Is the Increase in Baby Deaths in the US a Result of Fukushima Fallout?|website=CounterPunch.org|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael Moyer of [[Scientific American]] stated that their claims are "critically flawed—if not deliberate mistruths", pointing out that this increase only appears [[Cherry picking|when choosing these specific time periods]], and there is no trend in the overall numbers for the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/are-babies-dying-in-the-pacific-northwest-due-to-fukushima-a-look-at-the-numbers/|title=Are Babies Dying in the Pacific Northwest Due to Fukushima?

Only by explicitly excluding data from January and February were Sherman and Mangano able to froth up their specious statistical scaremongering.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, they claimed that fallout from Fukushima resulted in 13,983 excess deaths in the United States in the 14 weeks following the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mangano|first=Joseph J.|last2=Sherman|first2=Janette D.|date=2012-01-01|title=An unexpected mortality increase in the United States follows arrival of the radioactive plume from Fukushima: is there a correlation?|journal=International Journal of Health Services: Planning, Administration, Evaluation|volume=42|issue=1|pages=47–64|issn=0020-7314|pmid=22403909|doi=10.2190/hs.42.1.f}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study was criticized for including different numbers of cities in the "before" and "after" categories,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Körblein|first=Alfred|date=2012-01-01|title=Response to "An unexpected mortality increase in the United States follows arrival of the radioactive plume from Fukushima: is there a correlation"?|journal=International Journal of Health Services: Planning, Administration, Evaluation|volume=42|issue=3|pages=553–555; discussion 561–570|issn=0020-7314|pmid=22993969|quote=The reason for the observed increase is that the data before and after Fukushima differ. ...

It assumes that the "excess" deaths after March 20 are a real signal, not just a statistical aberration, and that every one of them is due to Fukushima radiation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 2013 article, published in the ''[[Open Journal of Pedriatrics]]'', they claimed a 16% increase in cases of [[congenital hypothyroidism]] (CH) in 5 US states in the 10 months following the disaster.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2273">A '''resel''', from ''res''olution ''el''ement, is a concept used in [[image analysis]]. It describes the actual spatial [[image resolution]] in an image or a volume.

The number of resels in the image will be lower or equal to the number of pixel/voxels in the image. 
In an actual image the resels can vary across the image and indeed the local resolution can be expressed as "resels per [[pixel]]" (or "resels per [[voxel]]").

In [[functional neuroimaging]] analysis, an [[Estimation theory|estimate]] of the number of resels together with [[random field]] theory is used in [[statistical inference]].
Keith Worsley has proposed an estimate for the number of resels/roughness.

==History==
The word "resel" is related to the words "[[pixel]]" and "[[voxel]]", and [[Waldo R. Tobler]] is probably among the first to use the word.&lt;ref&gt;http://geog.tamu.edu/~yong/Guru1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert E. (Bob) Griswold''' (born January 1, 1935, [[Chicago, Illinois]]) is an American author, educator, composer and business leader, and a long-time leader in the field of [[Human Potential Movement|human potential development]]. He is the founder of Effective Learning Systems, Inc. and has authored over one hundred [[self-help]] audio programs. He is best known for his audio series The Love Tapes and While-U-Drive and his book Attract Money and More.[https://www.amazon.com/s?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=bob+griswold&amp;sprefix=Bob+Gris]

==Biography==
Bob was born in Chicago on January 1, 1935.  He was the third son of parents William &amp; Esther Griswold, both born in Burlington, Iowa.

He attended Smyser Elementary school 1940 - 1948, Steinmetz High School, 1948–1952, Wright Junior College 1952 - 1954, and graduated from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] in 1957.

He married his wife Deirdre in 1963.  They have four children, Kimberly, Kevin, Robert and Jeffrey.

In 1972, he moved his family to Edina Minnesota [[Edina, Minnesota]] where he founded Effective Learning Systems, Inc. [http://effectivelearningsystems.com/] He claims to have personally taught over 50,000 people techniques for relaxation, memory, stress management, controlling habits, goal achievement and self-esteem through seminars conducted for corporations, government agencies, and the general public.[http://www.efflearn.com/success_stories.php]

Griswold has presented many conferences and workshops at the [[University of Minnesota]] and other colleges featuring world-renowned speakers such as [[Norman Cousins]], [[Bernie Siegel]], [[R. Buckminster Fuller]], [[Karl Menninger]], [[O. Carl Simonton]], [[Wayne Dyer]], [[Joyce Brothers]], and others. Many of these prominent professionals have become members of Effective Learning Systems' board of advisors and have contributed a great deal in their knowledge and friendship.[http://www.efflearn.com/about.php/#board]

Griswold's work soon evolved into the most popular series of individual [[self-help book|self-help audios]] in the industry. These have become the top-selling line of self-help audio programs in North American retail bookstores-including over 15 years on the [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] Bestsellers list, and have reached millions via mail order and the internet. His books and audios are available at [https://www.amazon.com/Robert-E.-Griswold/e/B001HMPMI0 Amazon.com], [http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?ATH=Robert+E.+Griswold&amp;SZE=100&amp;SRT=S Barnes &amp; Noble], [http://www.borders.com/online/store/SearchResults?view=2&amp;rpp=25&amp;type=1&amp;contrib=robert+e+griswold&amp;kids=false&amp;nav=5185&amp;simple=false Borders], and other retailers. Distribution of his books and audios has been primarily within the United States, but his programs are available throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newarrivals.nlb.gov.sg/itemdetail.aspx?bid=12797267 Bob Griswold Audio Programs at Singapore National Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

The same principles of improving self-esteem, which have been so effective for adults attending his seminars and listening to his tapes and CDs are now available for children on ''Songs for Self-Esteem'' for which he wrote all of the music and lyrics for this album series. He enlisted the assistance of some of the top producers, arrangers, vocalists, musicians, and studio facilities available to help realize his dream to help children make a better future for themselves and the world. [http://www.efflearn.com/product_info.php/cPath/56/products_id/149]

Griswold also served as a consultant to the [[Science Museum of Minnesota]] as Vice-President of the Minnesota Futurists and was appointed by Gov. [[Arne Carlson]] to the Minnesota Early Childhood Care and Education Council.

Griswold wrote ''How To Attract Money'' (published by Hachette Book Group,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/authors_Robert-E-Griswold-(1017909)_Bibliography.aspx Bob Griswold at Hachette Book Group]&lt;/ref&gt; formerly [[Warner Books]]), which deals with the relationship between self-esteem and financial success. It is based on one of his most popular self-help audio titles and has been printed in seven languages. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0446393312]

He has recently updated and expanded that work with his new book ''Attract Money and More''.[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1558482202]

==Ideas and teachings ==
Bob Griswold pioneered techniques for using the concepts of self-esteem, positive thinking, and the power of love to live a better life. Among the strategies and techniques that Bob has developed, copyrighted, and/or incorporated in his teaching are: a unique approach to meditative success known as Productive Meditation, Guided Imagery, Success Statements,  Mental Movie Visualization, 10 Minute Goal Setting, Whole-Brain Learning, and Music Affirmations, which are well-researched positive statements arranged and blended with carefully selected up-beat music and are featured in his While-U-Drive series of audios.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.efflearn.com/about.php Effective Learning Systems, Inc. official web site&lt;/ref&gt;

Particular areas of focus include the origins of the Romani people, experiences of [[persecution]] and [[Political repression|political oppression]], the [[Romani language]], [[Romani society and culture]], and Romani customs and traditions. As a formal discipline, Romani studies originated in the [[United Kingdom]] in the 1990s, with key contributors including [[Ian Hancock]], Thomas Acton, David Smith, and Michael Stewart.

The area of inquiry of Romani studies often extends beyond ethnic Roma to [[Irish Traveller]]s, [[Yeniche people|Yeniche]], and other groups traditionally known as [[Names of the Romani people#Gypsy|Gypsies]].

==Publications==
The main publication in this field is the [[academic journal]] ''Romani Studies'', which is published by the [[Gypsy Lore Society]] and edited by Kimmo Granqvist, Professor in Romani studies at Södertörn University, Stockholm.

'''Roots of Europe''' (full name: '''Roots of Europe – Language, Culture, and Migrations''') is an interdisciplinary research centre at the [[University of Copenhagen]], focusing on [[prehistoric Europe]]. It is headed by [[Birgit Anette Olsen]] (2008-2013 by [[Jens Elmegård Rasmussen]]) and involves more than 40 linguists, archaeologists, geneticists and other scholars from universities in Europe and the USA. 
The centre was initiated in 2008 and is financed through the University of Copenhagen Programmes of Excellence. It has close ties to the local programme in [[Indo-European studies]]. It is physically based at the Department of Nordic Studies and Linguistics and hosts the departmental collection of Indo-European linguistics handbooks.

==Structure and activities ==

The common research projects are organized from Copenhagen. While the basic working group there mainly concentrates on the linguistic aspects, the external project members deal both with linguistics, religion and mythology, archaeology and genetics. An international advisory board covers all of the basic fields. From 2013 onwards, the centre also functions as an umbrella for several new research projects, which do not form part of the original programme but are founded by the [[VELUX]] foundation and the Danish Research Council for the Humanities.
Research results emerging from the projects are published mainly in the book series [[Copenhagen Studies in Indo-European]].

'''Stopped-flow''' is a lab technique for studying fast chemical reactions. 

A '''stopped-flow''' instrument is a rapid mixing device used to study the [[chemical kinetics]] of fast reactions in solution. The solutions are first forced from syringes into a mixing chamber. After perhaps a few milliseconds the observation cell is filled by a piston linked to a sensing switch that triggers the measuring device and the flow is stopped suddenly. The system is often modeled by conventional kinetic equations.  

After two or more solutions containing the [[reagent]]s are mixed, they are studied by whatever experimental methods are deemed suitable. Different forms of [[spectroscopy]] and [[scattering]] of radiation are common methods used. The dead time is the time between the end of mixing the two solutions and the beginning of observation of the kinetics of the reaction. The usual dead time of a stopped flow apparatus is 1–2 milliseconds but some new devices have been developed that have dead times of 0.3–0.6 ms.

A stopped-flow instrument coupled to either a [[circular dichroism]] spectrometer or a [[fluorescence spectroscopy|fluorescence spectrometer]] is often used in the field of [[protein folding]], to observe rapid unfolding and/or refolding of proteins.

== Quenched-flow ==
In a [[quenched-flow]] instrument, the reaction is stopped after a certain amount of time has passed after mixing. The stopping of the reaction is called [[quenching]] and it can be achieved by various means, for example by mixing with another solution, which stops the reaction (chemical quenching), quickly lowering the temperature (freeze quenching) or even by exposing the sample to light of a certain wavelength (optical quenching).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12914">'''Temperament Isolation Theory''', also known as personality bias or personality discrimination, is a recent{{when|date=May 2018}} [[social science]] theory that attempts to explain how cultures favor a specific [[temperament]] and how they view and interact with those of other or opposite temperaments. The first concepts of the theory were explored by Susan Cain in her book ''[[Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking|Quiet]]'' where she looked at how [[western culture]]s, particularly the United States, value [[extroversion]] over [[introversion]] and how that could possibly make it difficult for introverts to thrive in society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking|last = Cain|first = Susan|publisher = Crown Publishing Group|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Northern Arizona University professor Jorge Rodriguez III took the idea a step further and viewed how the opposite could be viewed in eastern cultures where introversion is valued over extroversion. These observations and further research led to the concept of "personality bias" which suggests certain personalities are favored over others and that these opposing personalities are "intentionally or unintentionally oppressed or muted."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Personality Biases in Western and Eastern cultures|last = Rodriguez III|first = Jorge|date = 2013|journal = American Journal of Cultural Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of personality bias was later formally formulated into Temperament Isolation Theory. The theory is currently not widely accepted among social scientists, but it is gaining ground thanks to the research of Rodriguez and others.

== History/Origins  ==

The concept of personality bias was explored by Susan Cain in her book ''Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking,'' released in January, 2012. Cain explored how western cultures, particularly that of the United States, place much value on extroversion. The social structures of the U.S. including the workforce and public education encourage and teach people to be outspoken, engaging and group-minded. Cain refers to this bias as the "extrovert ideal" where people are valued for what they say and how they present themselves rather than their character, talents and skills.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She also discusses the rise of  collaboration and [[groupthink]] in the United States and how group work is seen as superior or more effective than individual contribution. Cain argues that the extrovert ideal has made it difficult for introverts to thrive and succeed in the United States.

Cain also introduced definitions and parameters for temperament. According to the Cain, temperament (extroversion and introversion) is a person's core personality and influences many of the traits the person develops over his or her lifetime. Temperament is not defined on how social a person is or on whether they are shy or not. Rather, temperament is influenced by sensory sensitivity. Introverts are highly sensitive to outside stimulus and can often be overwhelmed by it. Extroverts are much less sensitive to stimulus and often need more exposure to it in order to feel a response. For example, an introvert may feel overwhelmed at a rock concert because she is sensitive to all the stimuli (music, lights, voices, touch etc.) and she is taking all of it in at once, whereas an extrovert is not sensitive and wants to experience these stimuli even more. Cain also notes that temperament is a spectrum rather a definitive extreme. Some introverts are less sensitive than others and feel more comfortable in social situations and vice versa. People lean more towards introversion or extroversion and, in some cases, fall in the middle (ambivert). Temperament can also be situational in which a single individual may exhibit more extroverted or introverted traits in specific situations. 

Temperament as it pertains to eastern cultures is also briefly touched on by Cain. She notes that eastern cultures are the opposite of western cultures in that they tend to value introversion over extroversion. She specifically examined the experiences of Asian-American families. Asian-Americans struggle a lot in American society because their culture and home life encourage introversion, but their social lives outside the home put pressure on them to be extroverted. 

Susan Cain and her book ''Quiet'' are credited with starting what is called the "Quiet Revolution" which calls for introverts to learn to value and appreciate themselves and use their strengths to find their place in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.quietrev.com/about-us/|title = Quiet Revolution's Mission and Values|date = 2015|accessdate = |website = Quiet Revolution|publisher = |last = Cain|first = Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is rather small but is nonetheless designed to help introverts cope with inequalities and difficulties they face in an extroverted-dominated society. 

== Expansion and Social Scientific Research ==
Social Scientist and Associate Professor at Northern Arizona University Jorge Rodriguez III was intrigued by the ideas presented by Cain and began to research them scientifically in 2012. Rodriguez's research found that extroversion is indeed highly valued in the United States and that this value of extroversion often does come at the expense of marginalizing introverts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, Rodriguez believed this was mostly unintentional and some introverts have been successfully able to bypass the "personality bias" with strong, creative ideas and hard work ethic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Regardless, a personality does exist which can lead to the oppression of introverts.

Rodriguez took his research a step further and looked how personality bias differs among cultures. While Cain briefly touched on the subject in ''Quiet'', Rodriguez felt further research and observation was needed. Rodriguez found that eastern cultures, particularly that of Hong Kong, China, had a personality bias for introversion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unlike the U.S., China places more value on character and individual leadership. The good of organization or group, including the family, is much more important than individual desire and need. Being quite is seen as a symbol of wisdom, humility and selflessness. By contrast, extroversion can be viewed as a symbol arrogance and self-interest. Much like how the climate in the U.S. has marginalized introverts, the value of introversion in China has made difficult for extroverts to find respect and success. However, unlike the U.S. where this oppression is mostly unintentional, Rodriguez believes it is more deliberate in China as the culture has a spoken affliction towards extroverts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Rodriguez based much of his research in the concepts and ideas of other social scientific research and theory. In particular, Rodriguez used Muted Group Theory to see if temperaments can be muted/silenced much like other minority groups. While much less common and less extreme than with other minority groups based on sex and race, people of certain temperaments can indeed be muted by the dominant group, intentionally or unintentionally.

== Formulation of a Formal Theory ==
Not long after his research into personality bias, Rodriguez began work on the formulation of a formal theory. Using Muted Group Theory as the basis and incorporating the findings and observations of his research, Rodriguez formally introduced Temperament Isolation Theory in his book ''Temperament Isolation: The Study of Personality Bias in Culture''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Temperament Isolation: The Study of Personality Bias in Culture.|last = Rodriguez III|first = Jorge|publisher = Northern Arizona University Publishing|year = 2014|isbn = |location = Flagstaff, Arizona|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodriguez used the term temperament in his theory to emphasize that it covers "overall personality" and not "individual traits and idiosyncrasies."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He also wanted to use temperament to emphasize that extroversion and introversion are not a measure of sociability but "other factors that have the potential to affect how one socializes."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The term isolation is also used to show that oppression is not always intentional. The theory suggests that certain temperaments, relative to culture, are inherently favored over others and this favoritism can often lead to the muting or oppression of opposite temperaments which can then make living in this culture challenging, impeding their success and acceptance of their beliefs, behaviors and values.

Assumption of Temperament Isolation Theory:
* Cultures are naturally inclined to favor certain temperaments.
* Favoritism towards a temperament almost always results in the isolation of other temperaments, intentional or not.
* Temperament refers to overall personality.
* Temperaments are not a measure of sociability.
* Temperaments are biologic and fixed from birth like race and sex.
While personality bias is not viewed to be on the same scale as racial discrimination or sexism, Rodriguez argues that it is still a concern because temperament is biologically fixed like race and sex. While people may be able to adjust their behaviors and "mask" their true personalities but they cannot change their core temperament.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If a person is introverted, they will always be introverted and vice versa. Rodriguez did not formulate Temperament Isolation to be a critical theory, but he acknowledges that it might address social inequality issues.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://arizonaweeklysun.com/news/science/do-we-discriminate-by-personality/|title = Do we discriminate by personality?|last = Jackson|first = Brent|date = 2014|work = |access-date = |via = Arizona Sun Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expansion, Criticism and Future ==
Rodriguez plans to expand on the ideas of Temperament Isolation, particularly as it relates to other cultures. While most cultures can be divided into western and eastern, Rodriguez believes it may be more diverse than that. Rodriguez in particular wants to study Middle Eastern and South American cultures as he feels they don't quite align with the standard western and eastern distinctions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Rodriguez is also interested in researching the possibility of temperaments beyond introversion and extroversion. The idea of ambiversion is of particular interest as ambiverts are supposed to be sensory balanced.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Temperament Isolation Theory is not currently accepted as formal social science theory. Many sociologists feel the theory needs more concrete concepts and empirical data. Rodriguez's research and observations are considered preliminary and many feel there needs to be more measurable results (qualitative and quantitative) to support the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Current and upcoming research and topics in human communication|last = Grahamn|first = Derek R.|date = 2014|journal = Journal of Human Communication Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to preliminary nature of the theory, some sociologists suggest the idea of personality bias in itself is illogical. Critics feel Cain and Rodriguez are "over extending" by trying to suggest that discrimination or oppression of personality is similar to racial  discrimination or sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://socialsciencemag.com/news/opinions/personality_bias_is_absurd|title = Personality Bias is absurd|last = Fossett|first = James C.|date = 2015|work = |access-date = |via = Social Science Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Rodriguez's future research plans, other social scientists are exploring the idea of personality bias. Researchers like Janise Hoalburrough and Sean Greeson applied concepts of personality bias to workforce performance and success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Temperament and workforce performance: factors, theories and findings|last = Greeson|first = Sean|date = 2014|journal = British Journal of Business Communication|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Hoalburrough|first2 = Janise}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personality bias has also reinvigorated the study of personality and temperament by psychologists. Michelle Chavira recently published an article that explores new research in temperament and included some of Rodriguez's findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Re-evaluating temperament: biological and psychological factors|last = Chavira|first = Michelle|date = 2015|journal = American Journal of Behavioral Psychology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Cain is also continuing her "[http://www.quietrev.com/ Quiet Revolution]" where she attempts to empower introverts and help them find success.

'''Tissue residue''' is the concentration of a chemical or compound in an organism’s tissue, or a portion of an organism’s tissue.&lt;ref name="McCarty93"&gt;McCarty, L. and D. MacKay. 1993. Enhancing ecotoxicological modeling and assessment. Environmental Science and Technology 27 (9): 1719-1728.&lt;/ref&gt; Tissue residue is used in [[aquatic toxicology]] to help determine the fate of chemicals in aquatic systems, [[bioaccumulation]] of a substance, [[bioavailability]] of a substance, account for multiple routes of exposure (ingestion, absorption, inhalation), and address an organism’s exposure to chemical mixtures.&lt;ref name="Tissue-based"&gt;Tissue-Based Criteria for “Bioaccumulative” Chemicals.http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/sap/meetings/2008/october/aquatic_life_criteria_guidelines_tissue_08_26_05.pdf U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 2005&lt;/ref&gt; A Tissue residue approach to toxicity testing is considered a more direct and less variable measure of chemical exposure and is less dependent on external environmental factors than measuring the concentration of a chemical in the exposure media.&lt;ref name="McElroy"&gt;McElroy, A.E., M.G. Barron, N. Beckvar, S.B. K. Driscoll, J.P. Meador, T.F. Parkerton, T.G. Preuss, and J.A. Steevens. 2011. A review of the tissue residue approach for organic and organometallic compounds in aquatic organisms. Integrated environmental assessment and management 7 (1): 50-74.http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.132/abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, tissue residue approaches are used for chemicals that bioaccumulate or for bioaccumulative chemicals.&lt;ref name="Tissue-based" /&gt; The majority of these substances are [[organic compounds]] that are not easily metabolized by organisms and have long environmental persistence. Examples of these chemicals include: [[polychlorinated dibenzodioxins]], [[furans]], [[biphenyl]]s, [[DDT]] and its [[metabolites]], and [[dieldrin]].&lt;ref name="Tissue-based" /&gt;

The use of tissue residues in assessing toxicity and bioaccumulation may also be referred to as the tissue residue-effects approach (TRA), critical body residue (CBR) or tissue residue-based toxicity tests.&lt;ref name="McCarty93" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meador"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meador|first1=J.P.|title=The Tissue Residue Approach for Toxicity Assessment: Findings and Critical Reviews from a Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry Pellston Workshop|journal=Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management|date=2011|volume=7|issue=1|pages=2–6|doi=10.1002/ieam.133|pmid=21184566|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.133/abstract|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Historically, [[aquatic toxicology]] toxicity tests have focused on water-based approaches where concentration of a [[toxicant]] is determined by its concentration in the water.&lt;ref name="Tissue-based" /&gt; Although tissue residue use and concepts have existed for over 100 years due to interest in narcosis and anesthesia, it was not widely used in toxicology.&lt;ref name="McCarty11" /&gt; The first known study of tissue residue in environmental toxicology was reported in 1912 by White and Thomas who investigated the effects of copper exposure to fish using whole-body copper concentrations.&lt;ref name="McCarty11"&gt;McCarty, L.S., P.F. Landrum, S.N. Luoma, J.P. Meador, A.A. Merten, B.K. Shephard and A.P. van Wezel. 2011. Advancing environmental toxicology through chemical dosimetry: External exposures versus tissue residues. Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management 7 (1): 7-27.http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.98/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, there has been rapid growth in the tissue residue approach to toxicology.&lt;ref name="McCarty11" /&gt; The water-based approach has been re-evaluated due to challenges in assessing the [[toxicity]] of bioaccumulating chemicals.&lt;ref name="Tissue-based" /&gt; Water-based approaches are not always an accurate estimation of the concentration of a bioaccumulating chemical in an organism, nor does the water-based approach incorporate the multiple routes of exposure of an organism to a toxicant and the additive effects across these routes.&lt;ref name="Tissue-based" /&gt;

== Advantages ==

The use of tissue residue allows an investigator to: account for multiple routes of exposure, account for [[toxicokinetic]] differences between species, account for factors that alter bioavailability and potentially address exposure of an organism to a chemical mixture.&lt;ref name="McCarty93" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meador"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCarty11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jarvinen"&gt;Jarvinen, A.W., D.R. Mount and G.T. Ankley. Development of Tissue Residue Threshold Valueshttp://water.epa.gov/polwaste/sediments/cs/upload/mount.pdf U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCartyEPA"&gt;McCarty, L.S. Comments on the Significance and Use of Tissue Residues in Sediment Toxicology and Risk Assessment.http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/sediments/cs/upload/mccarty.pdf U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)&lt;/ref&gt; Tissue residue also has the ability to represent temporal and spatial exposure or an organism,&lt;ref name="Meador"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Field"&gt;Field, L.J. Use of Tissue Residue Data in Exposure and Effects Assessments for Aquatic Organisms.http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/sediments/cs/upload/field.pdf U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as clarify the cause-effect relationship of chemicals. These relationships are often distorted by uncertainty in chemical bioavailability.&lt;ref name="Meador"/&gt; The mechanism of action for a chemical depends on the internal tissue concentration, thus tissue residue gives researchers a more direct estimate of the residue-effect (dose-response) relationship.&lt;ref name="McElroy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dyer"&gt;Dyer, S., St J. Warne, J.S. Meyer, H. A. Leslie, and B.I. Escher. 2011. Tissue residue approach for chemical mixtures. Integrated environmental assessment and management 7 (1): 99-115.&lt;/ref&gt; Tissue residue is also less variable than other measures of chemical exposure.&lt;ref name="Tissue-based" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Field" /&gt;

In addition to the aforementioned advantages of tissue residue use, the U.S. EPA also states that this approach explicitly considers exposure through diet, will support identification and investigation of a chemical’s mode of action, incorporate the effects of an organism’s metabolism on accumulation and allow for experimental verification between lab and field studies.&lt;ref name="Jarvinen" /&gt;

== Disadvantages ==

The majority of issues with tissue residue arise in the interpretation of tissue residue data.&lt;ref name="McCarty93"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McElroy"/&gt; Interpretation complication can be caused by choice of endpoints, species choice, life stage sensitivity, data quality, and toxicity data extrapolation.&lt;ref name="McElroy"/&gt; Choice of tissue for tissue residue analysis can also be difficult and has an effect on tissue residue data. When choosing tissue, a scientist needs to consider: mode and mechanism of action of chemical being tested, site of toxic action for the chemical and species combination being studied and strength of the tissue residue-response relationship. There is also a lack of reliable tissue residue relationships available for comparison.&lt;ref name="McElroy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCarty11"/&gt;

Although use of tissue residue can account for multiple routes of exposure, it cannot identify the routes of exposure. Tissue residue also cannot account for [[biotransformation]] of organic chemicals.&lt;ref name="McElroy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCarty11"/&gt; If a chemical is biotransformed, the concentration of the parent chemical is lower, but the [[metabolites]] may still be toxic.&lt;ref name="McElroy"/&gt; Tissue residue approaches are not as useful for chemicals with short half-lives because an organism will only be sporadically exposed.&lt;ref name="McCarty93"/&gt; Overall, tissue residue is meant to compliment data from water-based approaches, not replace them.&lt;ref name="Meador"/&gt;

== Use in regulation ==

=== North America ===

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has incorporated tissue residue through the development of the [[Biotic Ligand Model]] as well as water quality standards for copper. USEPA has also recently published draft aquatic life criteria for selenium using a tissue-based approach. USEPA is currently working on incorporating tissue residue into standards for bioaccumulating chemicals, which are usually hydrophobic with a log octanol-water [[partition coefficient]] greater than 5 (log Kow&gt;5).&lt;ref name="Tissue-based" /&gt; Canada uses tissue residue formally in guidelines called tissue residue guidelines (TRGs), which are primarily used for protecting wildlife that consume aquatic life.&lt;ref name="Canada2"&gt;Canada Environmental Quality Guidelines. 1998. http://ceqg-rcqe.ccme.ca/download/en/290/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Canada"&gt;Canada Environmental Quality Guidelines. 1999. http://ceqg-rcqe.ccme.ca/download/en/314/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===

There is a lack of formal use of tissue residue in Europe.

=== Australia and New Zealand ===

Australia and New Zealand both use tissue residue-based approaches for [[biomonitoring]] programs for mussels and oysters.

=== Available databases ===

There are two comprehensive aquatic toxicology databases[[Aquatic Toxicology Databases]] available for tissue residue in the United States. The first is the [[Aquatic Toxicology Databases#Toxicity/Residue Database|Toxicity Residue Database]] maintained by the USEPA.&lt;ref name="McElroy"/&gt; The second is the Environmental residue-effects database [[Aquatic Toxicology Databases#Environmental Residue Effects Database|(ERED)]] maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.&lt;ref name="McElroy"/&gt; Currently, the majority of the data available is derived from acute lethal response studies.&lt;ref name="McElroy"/&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Metals ===

Tissue residue of metals in invertebrate prey organisms may reduce uncertainty in estimating exposure from multiple routes.&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt; This may be especially important in early life stages of an organism or for species listed under the [[Endangered Species Act]] (ESA).&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt; However, it is challenging to develop a suitable approach to assessing metal toxicity through tissue residue because water quality can have a large influence on metal toxicity. With the exception of [[organometallic compounds]], no generalized approaches have been created for analyzing metals in tissue residue, although site-specific and species-specific approaches have been successfully developed and used, especially for invertebrates.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;Adams, W. J., R. Blust, U. Borgmann, K. V. Brix, D. K. DeForest, A. S. Green, J. S. Meyer, J. C. McGeer, P. R. Paquin, P. S. Rainbow and C. M. Wood. 2010. Utility of tissue residues for predicting effects of metals on aquatic organisms. Integrated environmental assessment and management 7 (1): 75-98.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent paper examined tissue-residue toxicity for copper and cadmium in fish and found low variability among species for both metals compared to aqueous-exposure toxicity metrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meador|first1=J.P.|title=Tissue concentrations as the dose metric to assess potential toxic effects of metals in field-collected fish: Copper and cadmium|journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry|date=2015|volume=34|issue=6|pages=1309–1319|doi=10.1002/etc.2910|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/etc.2910/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These results indicate that whole-body concentrations of metals in fish may be useful for Environmental Quality Guidelines, forensic evaluation, and ecological risk assessment.  An additional benefit includes the potential to characterize a contaminated ecosystem based on elevated whole-body metal concentrations resulting from acclimation.

=== PAHs (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) ===

Fish are able to quickly metabolize and eliminate [[PAHs]], therefore tissue residue of parent PAH compounds will not provide adequate information on exposure to the organism.&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt; PAH exposure in fish has been associated with reproductive impairment, immune deficiency, and liver lesions as well as other health problems.&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt; In contrast, invertebrates do not metabolize and excrete PAHs as efficiently as fish, therefore an investigator can better understand location and temporal patterns of bioavailable PAHs through tissue residue of these invertebrates.&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt;

=== PCBs (Polychlorinated biphenyls) ===

Unlike PAHs, tissue residue of [[PCBs]] for fish can provide reliable information on exposure and toxicity.&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt; The tissue residue of PCBs in fish can provide vital information in an [[exposure assessment]] because fish generally receive PCBs through exposure via the food web. There are currently two screening approaches for PCBs in fish based on PCB body burdens.&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt;

=== In-situ ===

Both the United States and United Kingdom have mussel watch monitoring programs. Although these programs differ in many ways, both use tissue residues to establish biological effects, such as survival and body condition, of chemicals present. In contrast to the passive nature of the mussel watch monitoring programs, tissue residue has also been applied in [[in-situ]] bioassays in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.

=== Superfund sites ===

Tissue residue guidelines were developed for [[tributyltin]] (TBT) for the Harbor Island Superfund site, Lower Duwamish Superfund site and the Portland Harbor Superfund site. At the Harbor Island Superfund site, tissue trigger levels were developed to provide guidance on remediation action.&lt;ref name ="Sappington"/&gt; Tissue residue toxicity reference value (TRV) was developed for TBT regarding mortality and growth at the Lower Duwamish Superfund site. Tissue residue TRVs were also developed for TBT, as well as many other chemicals, for use in the Portland Harbor Superfund site work.&lt;ref name ="Sappington"/&gt;

=== Ecological risk assessment ===

Ecological [[risk assessment]] aims to source of contamination to exposure to a toxicity endpoint.&lt;ref name="McCarty11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Sappington"/&gt; This requires a risk assessor to identify and estimate exposure pathways.&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt; Tissue residue is the only approach that inherently accounts for toxicity due to multiple exposure pathways.&lt;ref name="McCarty93"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCarty11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jarvinen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCartyEPA"/&gt; There is also a need in risk assessment to understand the [[bioaccumulation]] of chemicals4, as well as a direct estimation of [[bioavailability]].&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt; Modeling food web exposure is difficult in risk assessment and requires many assumptions but this uncertainty can be reduced through tissue residue.&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt; Tissue residue may also allow provide a link between ecological risk assessment and human health risk assessment.&lt;ref name="McCarty11"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Sappington"/&gt;

The issues with using tissue residue in risk assessment are similar to the disadvantages listed above.&lt;ref name ="Sappington"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sappington|first1=K.G.|title=Application of the tissue residue approach in ecological risk assessment|journal=Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management|date=2011|volume=7|pages=116–140|doi=10.1002/ieam.116|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Verse drama''' is any [[drama]] written as [[poetry|verse]] to be spoken; another possible general term is '''poetic drama'''.  For a very long period, verse drama was the dominant form of drama in [[Europe]] (and was also important in non-European cultures).  [[Greek tragedy]] and [[Jean Racine|Racine]]'s plays are written in verse, as is almost all of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s drama, [[Ben Jonson]], [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] and others like [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[Faust (Goethe)|Faust]]''.

Verse drama is particularly associated with the seriousness of [[tragedy]], providing an artistic reason to write in this form, as well as the practical one that verse lines are easier for the actors to memorize exactly. In the second half of the twentieth century verse drama fell almost completely out of fashion with dramatists writing in English (the plays of [[Christopher Fry]] and [[T. S. Eliot]] being possibly the end of a long tradition).

==Dramatic verse==
'''Dramatic verse''' occurs in a dramatic work, such as a [[Play (theatre)|play]], composed in poetic form.  The tradition of dramatic verse extends at least as far back as [[ancient Greece]].

The [[English Renaissance]] saw the height of dramatic verse in the English-speaking world, with playwrights such as [[Ben Jonson]], [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[William Shakespeare]] developing new techniques, both for dramatic structure and poetic form.  Though a few plays, such as ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', feature extended passages of rhymed verse, the majority of dramatic verse is composed as [[blank verse]]; there are also passages of prose.

Dramatic verse began to decline in popularity in the nineteenth century, when the prosaic and conversational styles of playwrights such as [[Henrik Ibsen]] became more prevalent, and were adapted in English by [[George Bernard Shaw]]. Verse drama did have a role in the development of [[Irish theatre]].

==Closet drama==
{{main|closet drama}}
An important trend from around 1800 was the [[closet drama]]: a verse drama intended to be read from the page, rather than performed. [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], as well as a host of lesser figures, devoted much time to the closet drama, in a signal that the verse tragedy was already in a state of obsolescence. That is, while poets of the eighteenth century could write so-so poetic dramas, the public taste for new examples was already moving away by the start of the nineteenth century, and there was little commercial appeal in staging them.

Instead, [[opera]] would take up verse drama, as something to be sung: it is still the case that a verse [[libretto]] can be successful. Verse drama as such, however, in becoming closet drama, became simply a longer poetic form, without the connection to practical theatre and performance. 

According to [[Robertson Davies]] in ''[[A Voice From the Attic]]'', closet drama is "''Dreariest of literature, most second hand and fusty of experience!''". But indeed a great deal of it was written in [[Victorian era|Victorian times]], and afterwards, to the extent that it became a more popular long form at least than the faded [[Epic poetry|epic]]. Prolific in the form were, for example, [[Michael Field (pseudonym)|Michael Field]] and [[Gordon Bottomley]].

==Dramatic poetry in general==
'''Dramatic poetry''' is any poetry that uses the discourse of the characters involved to tell a story or portray a situation. 

The major types of dramatic poetry are those already discussed, to be found in plays written for the theatre, and [[libretti]]. There are further dramatic verse forms: these include [[dramatic monologue]]s, such as those written by [[Robert Browning]] and [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]] and [[William Shakespeare]].
