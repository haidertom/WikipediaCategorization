'''Aaron Marcus''' (born 22 May 1943)&lt;ref name=CAO&gt;{{cite book|title=Aaron Marcus|work=Contemporary Authors Online|publisher=Gale|location=Detroit|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States|American]] user-interface and information-visualization designer, as well as a computer graphics artist.

== Biography ==
Marcus was always interested in both science and technology as well as [[visual communication]]. He grew up in [[Omaha]], [[Nebraska]], in the 1950s, he was interested in astronomy and paleontology, and drawing cartoons. He learned painting, and calligraphy. In secondary school, he studied science and art, and was editor of his high-school newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter for Alexenberg, Mel (2007). Educating Artists in a Digital Age. UK: Intellect Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

He obtained his BA in Physics at  [[Princeton University]] in 1965. 
He obtained his BFA and MFA in 1968 at  [[Yale University]]’s School of Art and Architecture.
He learned about painting, drawing, printmaking, and letterpress printing workshops informally, photography, and art history. He also learned about book design, calligraphy, color, [[graphic design]], drawing, film making, printing, printmaking, painting, typography, and photography.

At Yale, while a design graduate student, he also began the study of [[computer graphics]], taking a course in basic functioning of computers, and he learned FORTRAN programming at the Yale Computer Center in the summer of 1966.

== Work ==
In 1967, Marcus spent a summer making [[ASCII art]] as a researcher at AT&amp;T’s Bell Laboratories in [[Murray Hill, New Jersey]].

From 1968 to 1977, in the School of Architecture and Urban Planning and in the Visual Arts Program, he taught at Princeton University: color, computer art, [[computer graphics]], concrete/visual poetry, environmental graphics, exhibit design, [[graphic design]], history/philosophy of design/visual communication, [[information design]], [[information visualization]], layout, publication design, systematic design, semiotics/semiologie, typography, and [[visual design]].

In 1969-71, he programmed a prototype desktop publishing page-layout application for AT&amp;T Bell Labs.
In 1971-73, he claims to have programmed some of the first virtual reality art/design spaces ever created while a faculty member at Princeton University.

In the early 1980s, he was a Staff Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, as well as a faculty member of the [[University of California at Berkeley]]’s College of Environmental Design.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informationdesign.org/special/marcus_interview.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, he founded [[Aaron Marcus and Associates, Inc.]] (AM+A), a user-interface design and consulting company, one of the first such independent, computer-based design firms in the world.

:''See [[Risala (disambiguation)]] for other books known as "Ar-Risala".''
The '''''Risāla''''' by  [[Al-Shafi‘i|ash-Shafi'i]] (d. 820), full title ''Kitab ar-Risāla fī Uṣūl al-Fiqh'' ({{lang-ar| كتاب الرسالة في أصول الفقه}} "book of the communication on the foundations of  comprehension (i.e. [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]])") is a seminal text on the [[principles of Islamic jurisprudence]]

The word ''risāla'' in Arabic means a "message" or "letter, communication". Shafi'i's treatise received its name owing to a traditional, though unverified, story that Shafi'i composed the work in response to a request from a leading [[Hadith studies|traditionist]] in [[Basra]], [https://bewley.virtualave.net/mad18.html ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Mahdī]; the story goes that Ibn Mahdī wanted Shafi'i to explain the legal significance of the [[Quran]] and the [[Sunnah|sunna]], and the ''Risāla'' was Shafi'i's response.&lt;ref name=majid&gt;''Islamic Jurisprudence: Shafi'i's Risala'', trans. by [[Majid Khadduri]], Baltimore: [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 1961, pp. 19-21 (Translator's Introduction).&lt;/ref&gt;

In this work, al-Shafi'i is said to have outlined four sources of [[Sharia|Islamic law]],&lt;ref name=majid/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, William H., and Marilyn Robinson Waldman.  ''The Islamic World''.  University of Chicago Press, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; though this division based on four has been attributed to later commentators on the work rather than to Shafi'i himself.&lt;ref&gt;"Does Shafi'i Have a Theory of 'Four Sources' of Law?, taken from the PhD dissertation of Joseph E. Lowry, ''The Legal-Theoretical Content of the Risala of Muhammad B. Idris al-Shafi'i'', [[University of Pennsylvania]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  Al-Shafi'i is  said he revised and re-read Al-Risala four hundred times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haddad|first1=G. F.|title=Imam Shafi`i|url=http://islamqa.org/shafii/qibla-shafii/34146|website=islamqa.org|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

# Introduction
# On al-Bayān (Perspicuous Declaration)
# On Legal Knowledge
# On the Book of God
# On the Obligation of Man to Accept the Authority of the Prophet
# On the Abrogation of Divine Legislation
# On Duties
# On the Nature of God's Orders of Prohibition and the Prophet's Orders of Prohibition
# On Traditions
# On Single-Individual Traditions
# On Consensus (Ijmā‘)
# On Analogy (Qiyās)
# On Personal Reasoning (Ijtihād)
# On Juristic Preference (Istiḥsān)
# On Disagreement (Ikhtilāf)

The above list of contents follows Khadduri's translation. However, Khadduri rearranged the treatise in two places. Khadduri's chapters 8 and 3 (in that order) both follow Shafi'i's chapter on Traditions in the original. Khadduri rearranged those chapters because they did "not appear to fit into the logical order of the book."&lt;ref&gt;Khadduri, p. 53 (Translator's Introduction).&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if one wishes to read Khadduri's translation while following Shafi'i's original arrangement, one can read the chapters in the following order: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 8, 3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

==Sources of law in ''Al-Risāla''==
The primary sources of law attributed to Shafi'is book are the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah|prophetic tradition]]. Most Muslim commentators have also referred to Shafi'is sections on [[Ijma|consensus]] and [[Qiyas|analogical reason]] as comprising legal sources.&lt;ref name=majid/&gt;

On the question of consensus, Shafi'i obligated affirmation of all living Muslims - both the learned and the laymen - in order to declare a true consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Khadduri, Introduction to Shafi'i's Risala, pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Later followers of his school considered this to be practically impossible, and thus expanded upon the definition.&lt;ref&gt;Khadduri, pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''anaerobic organism''' or '''anaerobe''' is any [[organism]] that does not require [[oxygen]] for growth. It may react negatively or even die if free oxygen is present. (In contrast, an [[aerobic organism]] (aerobe) is an organism that requires an oxygenated environment.)

An anaerobic organism may be unicellular (e.g. [[protozoa]]ns,&lt;ref name="pmc88967"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Upcroft P, Upcroft JA | title=Drug Targets and Mechanisms of Resistance in | pages= 150–164 | pmc=88967 | doi=10.1128/CMR.14.1.150-164.2001 | pmid=11148007 | volume=14 | date=January 2001 | journal=Clin.

==First observation==
In his letter of 14 June 1680 to The [[Royal Society]], [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] described an experiment he carried out by filling two identical glass tubes about halfway with crushed pepper powder, to which
some clean rain water was added. Van Leeuwenhoek sealed one of the glass tubes by using a flame and left the other glass tube open. Several days later, he discovered in the open glass tube ‘a
great many very little animalcules, of divers sort having its own particular motion.’ Not expecting to see any life in the sealed glass tube, Van Leeuwenhoek saw to his surprise ‘a kind of living animalcules that were round and bigger than the biggest sort that I have said were in the other water.’ The conditions in the sealed tube had become quite anaerobic owing to consumption of oxygen by aerobic microorganisms.&lt;ref name="Gest, Howard 2004 pp. 12"&gt;Gest, Howard. (2004) ''The discovery of microorganisms by Robert Hooke and Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, Fellows of the Royal Society'', in: 'The Royal Society May 2004 Volume: 58 Issue: 2: pp. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 [[Martinus Beijerinck]] repeated Van Leeuwenhoek's experiment and identified [[Clostridium butyricum]] as a prominent anaerobic bacterium in the sealed pepper infusion tube liquid. Beijerinck commented: &lt;blockquote&gt;'We thus come to the remarkable conclusion that, beyond doubt, Van Leeuwenhoek in his experiment with the fully closed tube had cultivated and seen genuine anaerobic bacteria, which would happen again only after 200 years, namely about 1862 by Pasteur. That Leeuwenhoek, one hundred years before the discovery of oxygen and the composition of air, was not aware of the meaning of his observations is understandable. But the fact that in the closed tube he observed an increased gas pressure caused by fermentative bacteria and in addition saw the bacteria, prove in any case that he not only was a good observer, but also was able to design an experiment from which a
conclusion could be drawn.' &lt;ref name="Gest, Howard 2004 pp. 12"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Classification==
[[Image:Ana.png|300px|thumb|right|Aerobic and anaerobic [[bacteria]] can be identified by growing them in test tubes of [[thioglycollate broth]]: &lt;br /&gt; 1: [[Obligate aerobe]]s need oxygen because they cannot ferment or respire anaerobically. They gather at the top of the tube where the oxygen concentration is highest. &lt;br /&gt; 2: [[Obligate anaerobe]]s are poisoned by oxygen, so they gather at the bottom of the tube where the oxygen concentration is lowest. &lt;br /&gt; 3: [[Facultative anaerobes]] can grow with or without oxygen because they can metabolise energy aerobically or anaerobically. They gather mostly at the top because aerobic respiration generates more [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) than either fermentation or anaerobic respiration. &lt;br /&gt; 4: [[Microaerophile]]s need oxygen because they cannot ferment or respire anaerobically. However, they are poisoned by high concentrations of oxygen. They gather in the upper part of the test tube but not the very top. &lt;br  /&gt; 5: Aerotolerant organisms do not require oxygen as they metabolise energy anaerobically. Unlike obligate anaerobes however, they are not poisoned by [[oxygen]].  They can be found evenly spread throughout the test tube. ]]

For practical purposes, there are three categories of anaerobe: 
*'''[[Obligate anaerobe]]s''', which are harmed by the presence of oxygen.&lt;ref name=PHK&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Prescott LM, Harley JP, Klein DA |title=Microbiology |publisher = Wm. C. Brown Publishers |year=1996 |edition=3rd |pages=130–131| isbn = 0-697-29390-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JMA&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Brooks GF, Carroll KC, Butel JS, Morse SA |title=Jawetz, Melnick &amp; Adelberg's Medical Microbiology |publisher = McGraw Hill |year=2007 |edition=24th |pages=307–312| isbn = 0-07-128735-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two examples of obligate anaerobes are ''Clostridium botulinum'' and the bacteria which live near hydrothermal vents on the deep-sea ocean floor.
*'''[[Aerotolerant|Aerotolerant organism]]s''', which cannot use oxygen for growth, but tolerate its presence.&lt;ref name=Hogg&gt;{{cite book |author=Hogg, S. |title=Essential Microbiology| publisher = Wiley |year=2005 |edition=1st |pages=99–100| isbn = 0-471-49754-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Facultative anaerobic organism|Facultative anaerobe]]s''', which can grow without oxygen but use oxygen if it is present.&lt;ref name="Hogg"/&gt;

==Energy metabolism==
Some obligate anaerobes use [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]], while others use [[anaerobic respiration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pommerville |first=Jeffrey |date=2010 |title=Alcamo's Fundamentals of Microbiology |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |page=177 |isbn= 9781449655822}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aerotolerant organisms are strictly fermentative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Slonim |first1=Anthony |last2=Pollack |first2=Murray |date=2006 |title=Pediatric Critical Care Medicine |publisher= Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |page=130 |isbn=9780781794695}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of oxygen, facultative anaerobes use [[aerobic respiration]]; without oxygen, some of them ferment; some use anaerobic respiration.&lt;ref name="Hogg"/&gt;

=== Fermentation ===
There are many anaerobic fermentative reactions.

Fermentative anaerobic organisms mostly use the lactic acid fermentation pathway:

:[[glucose|C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 2 [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] + 2 phosphate → 2 [[lactic acid]] + 2 [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]

The energy released in this equation is approximately 150 [[Kilojoule per mole|kJ per mol]], which is conserved in regenerating two ATP from ADP per [[glucose]]. This is only 5% of the energy per sugar molecule that the typical aerobic reaction generates.

Plants and fungi (e.g., yeasts) in general use alcohol (ethanol) fermentation when oxygen becomes limiting:

:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; ([[glucose]]) + 2 ADP + 2 phosphate → 2 C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH + 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↑ + 2 ATP

The energy released is about 180 kJ per mol, which is conserved in regenerating two ATP from ADP per glucose.

Anaerobic bacteria and [[archaea]] use these and many other fermentative pathways, e.g., [[propionic acid]] fermentation, [[butyric acid]] fermentation, solvent fermentation, mixed acid fermentation, [[butanediol fermentation]], [[Stickland fermentation]], [[acetogenesis]], or [[methanogenesis]].

== Culturing anaerobes ==
Since normal microbial culturing occurs in atmospheric air, which is an aerobic environment, the culturing of anaerobes poses a problem.  Therefore, a number of techniques are employed by microbiologists when culturing anaerobic organisms, for example, handling the bacteria in a [[glovebox]] filled with nitrogen or the use of other specially sealed containers, or techniques such as injection of the bacteria into a [[Dicotyledon|dicot]] plant, which is an environment with limited oxygen. The GasPak System is an isolated container that achieves an anaerobic environment by the reaction of water with [[sodium borohydride]] and [[sodium bicarbonate]] tablets to produce hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide. [[Hydrogen]] then reacts with oxygen gas on a palladium catalyst to produce more water, thereby removing oxygen gas. The issue with the Gaspak method is that an adverse reaction can take place where the bacteria may die, which is why a [[thioglycollate broth|thioglycollate medium]] should be used. The thioglycollate supplies a medium mimicking that of a dicot, thus providing not only an anaerobic environment but all the nutrients needed for the bacteria to thrive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftp.ccccd.edu/dcain/CCCCD%20Micro/gaspakjar.htm "GasPak System"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928043031/http://ftp.ccccd.edu/dcain/CCCCD%20Micro/gaspakjar.htm |date=2009-09-28 }}. Accessed May 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multicellularity==
Except for three species of anaerobic [[loricifera]], all known complex multicellular life is [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]], i.e. needs oxygen to survive.

In 2010 three species of anaerobic loricifera were discovered in the [[hypersaline]] [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] [[L'Atalante basin]] at the bottom of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. They lack [[mitochondria]] which contain the [[oxidative phosphorylation]] pathway, which in all other animals combines [[oxygen]] with [[glucose]] to produce metabolic energy, and thus they consume no oxygen. Instead these loricifera derive their energy from [[hydrogen]] using [[hydrogenosomes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/04/100416-oxygen-free-complex-animals-mediterranean/ Oxygen-Free Animals Discovered-A First, National Geographic news]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20370908"/&gt;

'''Anarcho-conservatism''' or '''conservative anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[ideology]] that combines [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[politics]] and [[Conservatism|conservative values]]. Anarcho-conservatism opposes the state and all government control, while supporting social conservative policies. Conservative anarchism opposes state coercion but does not necessarily object to a naturally occurring hierarchy in certain social situations, e.g. religious institutions. Finally, it advocates the abolition of the state and the wholesale replacement of state law by moral laws. Differently from [[Social anarchism|social anarchists]] and [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]], anarcho-conservatives don't oppose all authority, but in consonance with them, they do oppose the authority of the modern nation state, which they deem artificial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2001/07/daniel-mccarthy/anarcho-conservatism/|title=Anarcho-Conservatism - LewRockwell LewRockwell.com|work=LewRockwell.com|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, conservative anarchists might oppose abortion, drug use and pornography, on moral grounds, while at the same time opposing their prohibition through government. This absolute rejection of the state legislation is what differentiates anarcho-conservatism from [[Libertarian conservatism|libertarianism conservatism]]. As conservatives typically do, conservative anarchists support traditional family structures and, much like all [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] orientations, support gun and property rights. These however take a backseat to traditional and religious morality, if a conflict between them arises. In particular, this differentiates anarcho-conservatism from anarcho-capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=conservative%20anarchist|title=Urban Dictionary: conservative anarchist|website=Urban Dictionary|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-conservatism has much in common with [[paleolibertarianism]], except the the support of right wing populists in political elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://libertarianuniverse.com/2015/08/20/anarcho-conservatism-explained-by-vincent-john/|title=Anarcho-Conservatism Explained|date=2015-08-20|work=LibertarianUniverse: A Right-Libertarian Blog|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian anarchism]] is an instance of anarcho-conservatism.

== History ==

=== Old Testament ===
[[Jacques Ellul]], a French philosopher and Christian anarchist, notes that the final verse of the [[Book of Judges]] (Judges 21:25) states that there was no king in Israel and that "everyone did as they saw fit".&lt;ref&gt;

Subsequently, as recorded in the first [[Books of Samuel|Book of Samuel]] (1 Samuel 8) the [[Israelites|people of Israel]] wanted a king "so as to be like other nations".&lt;ref&gt;

God declared that the people had rejected him as their king. He warned that a human king would lead to [[militarism]], [[conscription]] and [[Tax#History|taxation]], and that their pleas for mercy from the king's demands would go unanswered. [[Samuel]] passed on God's warning to the Israelites but they still demanded a king, and [[Saul]] became their ruler.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Modern age ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Young England movement of the 1830s and ‘40s argued that the more feudal models of traditional aristocracy and land ownership within the framework of communities which are self-policing (i.e. each community is autonomous rather than imposed by the state) was the best path to liberty, rather than mainstream liberal models. In short, Tory anarchists might have defended traditional and hereditary institutions like monarchy and aristocracy, but they had anarchist sympathies in the sense that they did not believe in a centralised, unitary government, and sometimes saw a reactionary counterrevolution as the only path to political success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theburkean.co.uk/anarcho-conservatism-even-thing/|title=Anarcho-conservatism – Is that even a thing?|date=2017-10-01|work=The Burkean|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a Tory anarchist was first coined by Orwell to describe both Jonathan Swift and himself, and at its broadest it describes someone who is both a radical and a traditionalist. To be a Tory anarchist, then, is to embrace all manner of contradictions. It is a defence of good manners, good grammar, local customs and practices, respect for the individual and for privacy and an overwhelming hostility to the expanding power of the modern state. … Orwell saw Tory anarchism as a part of Britain's, mainly England's, rich social history, manifesting itself in particular figures at different times and places. These figures include not only Swift but Parson Bull, William Cobbett, Bishop Phillpotts and Richard Oastler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The strange case of Tory anarchism|last=1963-|first=Wilkin, Peter|date=2010|publisher=Libri Pub|isbn=9781907471100|location=Faringdon, Oxfordshire|oclc=662410383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There’s not a Tory anarchist tradition exactly, but the label has been applied, with good reason, to writers like Albert Jay Nock, Evelyn and Auberon Waugh, Mencken, Florence King, Dwight Macdonald, even Orwell and Max Beerbohm.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ordinary-times.com/2011/01/03/tory-anarchism-in-america-an-interview-with-daniel-mccarthy/|title=Tory Anarchism in America: An Interview with Daniel McCarthy - Ordinary Times|last=Kain|first=Erik|date=2011-01-03|work=Ordinary Times|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoppe generally describes himself as libertarian or anarcho-capitalist, but I cannot see that he would reject the ultra-conservative label, or I certainly do not see how can do so consistently, since he prefers monarchy to democracy. That is he prefers rule by one hereditary individual to rule by a representative assembly, or by direct democracy, and clearly regards the global move from monarchy to democracy as regrettable. His explanation is that a hereditary ruler has a great interest in maintaining the state since it belongs to that ruler and the descendants of that ruler in perpetuity. The hereditary ruler’s interest in maintaining the state is certainly greater than that of elected politicians, as these politicians are temporary and have a greater interest in extracting resources from the state than in maintaining it’s long term existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stephankinsella.com/2009/09/hoppe-habermas%E2%80%99s-anarcho-conservative-student/|title=Hoppe: Habermas’s Anarcho-Conservative Student|work=StephanKinsella.com|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
== Anarcho-conservative Quotes from Notable Authors ==

=== Albert Jay Nock (1870 – 1945) ===
[[Albert Jay Nock]] was the editor of ''[[The Freeman]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]''.&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone knows that the State claims and exercises the monopoly of crime that I spoke of a moment ago, and that it makes this monopoly as strict as it can. It forbids private murder, but itself organizes murder on a colossal scale. It punishes private theft, but itself lays unscrupulous hands on anything it wants, whether the property of citizen or alien. There is, for example, no human right, natural or Constitutional, that we have not seen nullified by the United States Government. Of all the crimes that are committed for gain or revenge, there is not one that we have not seen it commit — murder, mayhem, arson, robbery, fraud, criminal collusion and connivance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Sosy1SDXYNUC|title=On Doing the Right Thing|last=Nock|first=Albert Jay|date=1956|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|isbn=9781610163781|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== J.R.R. Tolkien (1892 – 1973) ===
[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] was [[Merton Professors|Professor of English Language and Literature]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], and the author of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.&lt;blockquote&gt;My political opinions lean more and more to Anarchy (philosophically understood, meaning the abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs) — or to ‘unconstitutional’ Monarchy. I would arrest anybody who uses the word State (in any sense other than the inanimate real of England and its inhabitants, a thing that has neither power, rights nor mind); and after a chance of recantation, execute them if they remained obstinate! … Government is an abstract noun meaning the art and process of governing and it should be an offence to write it with a capital G or so to refer to people … The most improper job of any many, even saints (who at any rate were at least unwilling to take it on), is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity … There is only one bright spot and that is the growing habit of disgruntled men of dynamating factories and power-stations; I hope that, encouraged now as ‘patriotism’, may remain a habit! But it won’t do any good, if it is not universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9eLCAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Letters+of+J.R.R.+Tolkien|title=The Letters of J.R.R.

=== Paul Weyrich (1942 – 2008) ===
[[Paul Weyrich]] was the co-founder of [[The Heritage Foundation]], [[The Free Congress Foundation]], and the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]].&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe that we probably have lost the culture war. That doesn’t mean the war is not going to continue, and that it isn’t going to be fought on other fronts. But in terms of society in general, we have lost. This is why, even when we win in politics, our victories fail to translate into the kind of policies we believe are important. Therefore, what seems to me a legitimate strategy for us to follow is to look at ways to separate ourselves from the institutions that have been captured by the ideology of Political Correctness, or by other enemies of our traditional culture. I would point out to you that the word "holy" means "set apart", and that it is not against our tradition to be, in fact, "set apart". You can look in the Old Testament, you can look at Christian history. You will see that there were times when those who had our beliefs were definitely in the minority and it was a band of hardy monks who preserved the culture while the surrounding society disintegrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000815232714/http://www.freecongress.org:80/fcf/specials/weyrichopenltr.htm|title=Free Congress Foundation Online ---|date=2000-08-15|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Hans-Hermann Hoppe (b. 1949) ===
[[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]] is Professor Emeritus of Economics at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]], Senior Fellow of the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], and founder and president of the [[Property and Freedom Society]].&lt;blockquote&gt;Many libertarians hold the view that all that is needed to maintain a libertarian social order is the strict enforcement of the non-aggression principle (NAP). Otherwise, as long as one abstains from aggression, according to their view, the principle of “live and let live” should hold. Yet surely, while this “live and let live” sounds appealing to adolescents in rebellion against parental authority and all social convention and control (and many youngsters have been initially attracted to libertarianism believing that this “live and let live” is the essence of libertarianism), and while the principle does indeed hold and apply for people living far apart and dealing with each other only indirectly and from afar, it does ''not'' hold and apply, or rather it is ''insufficient'', when it comes to people living in close proximity to each other, as neighbors and cohabitants of the same community.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A simple example suffices to make the point. Assume a new next-door neighbor. This neighbor does not aggress against you or your property in any way, but he is a “bad” neighbor. He is littering on his own neighboring property, turning it into a garbage heap; in the open, for you to see, he engages in ritual animal slaughter, he turns his house into a “Freudenhaus,” a bordello, with clients coming and going all day and all night long; he never offers a helping hand and never keeps any promise that he has made; or he cannot or else he refuses to speak to you in your own language. Etc., etc.. Your life is turned into a nightmare. Yet you may not use violence against him, because he has not aggressed against you. What can you do? You can shun and ostracize him. But your neighbor does not care, and in any case you alone thus ‘punishing’ him makes little if any difference to him. You have to have the communal respect and authority, or you must turn to someone who does, to persuade and convince everyone or at least most of the members of your community to do likewise and make the bad neighbor a social outcast, so as to exert enough pressure on him to sell his property and leave. …&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The lesson? The peaceful cohabitation of neighbors and of people in regular direct contact with each other on some territory – a tranquil, convivial social order – requires also a commonality of culture: of language, religion, custom and convention. There can be peaceful co-existence of different cultures on distant, physically separated territories, but multi-culturalism, cultural heterogeneity, cannot exist in one and the same place and territory without leading to diminishing social trust, increased tension, and ultimately the call for a “strong man” and the destruction of anything resembling a libertarian social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://misesuk.org/2017/10/20/libertarianism-and-the-alt-right-hoppe-speech-2017/|title=Libertarianism and the Alt-Right (Hoppe Speech, 2017)|date=2017-10-19|work=The Ludwig von Mises Centre|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Daniel McCarthy ===
Daniel McCarthy is the editor of ''[[Modern Age (periodical)|Modern Age]],'' director of the Robert Novak Journalism Fellowship Program at [[The Fund for American Studies]], and former editor of ''[[The American Conservative]]'' (2010 – 2016).&lt;blockquote&gt;Conservatism and anarchism share some historical background, as reactions against liberalism, and they share some critiques of liberalism.&amp;nbsp; It’s not that liberalism — broadly construed to include the “classical” variety in practice as well as the modern version — is the worst socio-political system imaginable.&amp;nbsp; The various totalitarianisms of the 20th century were far worse, and anarchists and conservatives alike have to be careful that in making a deep critique of liberalism they’re not opening the door to something far deadlier. But liberalism is not the end of history, and it’s not the final picture of justice.&amp;nbsp;Under the guise of democracy and markets, and human rights, various kinds of powers and interests are able to run quite unchecked.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Alexander Salter ===
Alexander Salter is Assistant Professor of Economics in the [[Rawls College of Business]], and the Comparative Economics Research Fellow at [[Texas Tech University]]'s Free Market Institute.&lt;blockquote&gt;Embracing anarchy does not require conservatives to embrace violent revolution, or even civil disobedience. But for their own sake, as well as the sake of the civilization which they love, conservatives can and should deny the state’s legitimacy, on the grounds that it is destructive of the true, the good, and the beautiful. Affirming sovereignty in the hopes it may someday fall within conservative hands is a siren song that must be resisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2017/10/conservatism-seek-destroy-state-alexander-salter.html|title=Should Conservatism Seek to Destroy the State? ~ The Imaginative Conservative|date=2017-10-17|work=The Imaginative Conservative|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7754">[[Image:Apical_Constriction.jpg|thumb|alt=apical constriction in C. elegans| Two stages in the constriction of apical surfaces (blue) of a pair of cells in ''C. elegans''.]]'''Apical constriction''' is the process in which contraction of the [[Apical (cell biology)|apical]] side of a cell causes the cell to take on a wedged shape.  Generally, this shape change is coordinated across many cells of an [[epithelial]] layer, generating forces that can bend or fold the cell sheet.&lt;ref name="refname1" group="Ref"/&gt;

==Morphogenetic role==
[[Image:Apicalconstriction fig1.jpg|thumb|alt=apical constriction of bottle cells initiates invagination.| Constriction of the apical side of cells in an epithelial layer generates enough force initiate invagination. In gastrulation, the apically constricting cells are known as bottle cells. The bottle shape results when constriction of the apical side of the cell squeezes the cytoplasm, thus expanding the basal side.]]

Apical constriction plays a central role in important [[morphogenetic]] events in both [[invertebrates]] and [[vertebrates]].  It is typically the first step in any invagination process and is also important in folding tissues at specified hingepoints.

During [[gastrulation]] in both invertebrates and vertebrates, apical constriction of a ring of cells leads to [[blastopore]] formation.  These cells are known as [[bottle cells]], for their eventual shape. Because all of the cells constrict on the apical side, the epithelial sheet bends convexly on the [[Basal membrane|basal]] side.

In vertebrates, apical constriction plays a role in a range of other morphogenetic processes such [[neurulation]], [[placode]] formation, and [[primitive streak]] formation.

==Mechanism==
[[File:Apical constriction mechanisms. Filamentous actin is represented in red, and myosin in orange..jpg|thumb|Apical constriction mechanisms (red: filamentous actin. orange: myosin.)]]
Apical constriction occurs primarily through the contraction of [[cytoskeletal]] elements.  The specific mechanism depends on the species, the cell type, and the morphogenetic movement. Here, we present a few well-studied examples in model organisms.

===''Xenopus''===

==== Bottle cells ====

During ''[[Xenopus]]'' gastrulation, bottle cells are located in the [[dorsal marginal zone]] and apically constrict inwards to initiate [[involution (medicine)|involution]] of the blastopore.  In these cells, apical constriction occurs when [[actomyosin]] contractility folds the [[cell membrane]] to reduce the apical surface area. [[Endocytosis]] of the membrane at the apical side further reduces surface area.  Active trafficking of these endocytosed [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] along [[microtubule]] tracks is also believed to be important, since the depolymerization (but not stabilization) of microtubules reduces the extent of apical constriction.&lt;ref name="refname2" group="Ref"/&gt;

Although apical constriction is always observed, it is not necessary for gastrulation, indicating that there are other morphogenetic forces working in parallel.  Researchers have shown that the removal of bottle cells does not inhibit gastrulation, but simply makes it less efficient.  Bottle cell removal does, however, result in deformed embryos.&lt;ref name="refname3" group="Ref"/&gt;

====Neural tube cells====
[[Image:Apicalconstriction fig2.jpg|thumb|alt=apical constriction during neurulation.| Apical constriction of cells at the hingepoints of neural folds generates forces that participate in neural tube closure.]]

[[Neural tube]] cells in ''Xenopus'' apically constrict during the initial invagination as well as during [[hingepoint]] folding.  Here, the mechanism depends upon the protein [[Shroom protein family|Shroom3]], which is sufficient to drive apical constriction.  Because Shroom3 is an actin-binding protein and accumulates on the apical side, the most likely mechanism is that Shroom3 aggregates the [[actin]] meshwork, generating a squeezing force.  Ectopic Shroom3 has been shown to be sufficient to induce apical constriction, but only in cells with apico-basal polarity.&lt;ref name="refname4" group="Ref"/&gt;

===''Drosophila''===
The molecular picture of apical constriction is most complete for ''[[Drosophila]]''. During ''Drosophila'' gastrulation, apical constriction of [[midline]] cells initiates invagination to create the [[ventral furrow]].  Like in ''Xenopus'', actomyosin contractility plays a major role in constricting the apical side of the cell.  The constricting cells have an actin meshwork directly beneath the apical membrane as well as circumferential actin belts lining the [[adherens junctions]] between cells.  Pulsed contractions of the actin meshwork are believed to be primarily responsible for reducing the apical surface area.

In Drosophila, researchers have also pinpointed the molecules responsible for ''coordinating'' apical constriction in time.  [[Folded Gastrulation]] (Fog), a secreted protein, and [[Concertina]], a [[G alpha subunit|G alpha]] protein, are members of the same pathway that ensure that apical constriction is initiated in the right cells at the right time.  The transmembrane protein [[T48 (protein)|T48]] is part of a redundant pathway that is also needed for coordination of apical constriction. Both pathways must be disrupted in order to completely block ventral furrow formation.  Both pathways also regulate the localization of [[RhoGEF2]], a member of the Rho family GTPases, which are known to regulate actin dynamics.&lt;ref name="refname5" group="Ref"/&gt;

[[Image:Apoplast and symplast pathways.svg|thumb|300px|The apoplastic and symplastic pathways]]
Inside a [[plant]], the '''apoplast''' is the space outside the [[plasma membrane]] within which material can diffuse freely. It is interrupted by the [[Casparian strip]] in [[root]]s, by air spaces between plant cells and by the [[plant cuticle]].

Structurally, the apoplast is formed by the continuum of cell walls of adjacent cells as well as the extracellular spaces, forming a tissue level compartment comparable to the [[symplast]]. The apoplastic route facilitates the transport of water and solutes across a tissue or organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Campbell, N.A.|author2=Reece, J.B.|year=2002|title=Biology |location=California|publisher=Benjamin Cummings|pages=753–754|isbn=0-8053-6624-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is known as ''apoplastic transport''.

The apoplast is important for all the plant's interaction with its environment. The main carbon source ([[carbon dioxide]]) needs to be solubilized in the apoplast before it diffuses through the plasma membrane into the cell's [[cytoplasm]] ([[symplast]]) and is used by the [[chloroplast]]s during [[photosynthesis]]. In the roots, ions diffuse into the apoplast of the [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] before diffusing into the symplast, or in some cases being taken up by specific [[ion channels]], and being pulled by the plant's [[transpiration stream]], which also occurs completely within the boundaries of the apoplast. Similarly, all gaseous molecules emitted and received by plants such as [[plant hormone]]s and other [[pheromone]]s must pass the apoplast. In nitrate poor soils, acidification of the apoplast increases cell wall extensibility and root growth rate. This is believed to be caused by a decrease in nitrate uptake (due to deficit in the soil medium) and supplanted with an increase in chloride uptake. H+ATPase increases the efflux of H+, thus acidifying the apoplast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

During local [[oxidative stress]], [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[superoxide]] anions can diffuse through the apoplast and transport a warning signal to neighbouring cells. In addition, a local alkalinization of the apoplast due to such a stress can travel within minutes to the rest of the plant body via the [[xylem]] and trigger [[systemic acquired resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The apoplast also plays an important role in resistance to aluminium toxicity and resistance. Exclusion of aluminium ions in the apoplast prevent toxic levels which inhibit shoot growth, reducing crop yields&lt;ref&gt;Horst, Walter.

==History==
The term apoplast was coined in 1930 by [[Ernst Münch|Münch]] in order to separate the "living" [[symplast]] from the "dead" apoplast.&lt;ref&gt;Münch, E (1930). ''Die Stoffbewegungen in der Pflanze''. Verlag von Gustav Fischer, Jena.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sattelmacher, B. (2000). The apoplast and its significance for plant mineral nutrition.

==Apoplastic transport==
The apoplastic pathway is one of the two main pathways for water transport in plants, the other being symplastic pathway. In apoplastic transport, water and minerals flow in an upward direction via the apoplast to the xylem in the root.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Merrill A.|last1=Ross|first2=Carole A.|last2=Lembi|title=Applied Weed Science: Including the Ecology and Management of Invasive Plants|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2008|page=79|isbn=978-0-13-502814-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concentration of solutes transported in aboveground organs is established through a combination of import from the xylem, absorption by cells, and export by the phloem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grignon|first=C.|last2=Sentenac|first2=H.|date=1991-01-01|title=pH and Ionic Conditions in the Apoplast|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.pp.42.060191.000535|journal=Annual Review of Plant Physiology and Plant Molecular Biology|volume=42|issue=1|pages=103–128|doi=10.1146/annurev.pp.42.060191.000535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transport velocity is higher in the apoplast than the symplast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uic.edu/classes/bios/bios100/lecturesf04am/lect19.htm|title=Transport in Plants|publisher=Department of Biological Sciences, University of Illinois at Chicago|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method of transport also accounts for a higher proportion of water transport in plant tissues than does symplastic transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Thomas N.

Some of the ions that enter through the roots do not make it to the xylem. The ions are excluded by the plasma membranes of the endodermal cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biological Science|last=Freeman|first=Scott|publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings|year=2011|isbn=978-0-321-59820-2|location=San Francisco, California|pages=747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
#Apoplast was previously defined as "everything but the [[symplast]], consisting of [[cell wall]]s and spaces between [[cell (biology)|cells]] in which [[water]] and [[solution|solutes]] can move freely". However, since solutes can neither freely move through the air spaces between plant cells nor through the cuticle, this definition has been changed. When referring to "everything outside the plasma membrane", the term "extracellular space" is in use.
#The word '''apoplasm''' is also in use with similar meaning as apoplast, although less common.

[[File:Paddington basement.jpg|thumb|Area railing and steps on a [[terraced house]] in Australia]]
In [[architecture]], an '''area''' ('''areaway''' in North America) is an excavated, [[Subterranea (geography)|subterranean]] space around the walls of a building, designed to admit light into a [[basement]]. Also called a [[lightwell]], it often provides access to the house for [[tradesmen]] and deliveries to vaults under the pavement; it stores coal and ash.

==Function==
The term is most commonly applied to urban houses of the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] period in the [[UK]], where it was normal for the service rooms, such as the [[kitchen]], [[Scullery (room)|scullery]] and [[laundry]], to be in the basement. Areas were commonly enclosed for safety reasons by wrought iron or cast iron railings, which became one of the principal decorative features of the [[astylar]] [[terraced house]]s of this period. Areas are also found in the English and French [[country house]], where basements were popular in the 18th century as a way of accommodating service functions while allowing all four faces of a symmetrical Classical building to relate directly to its landscape setting, as at [[Mereworth Castle]] in [[Kent]] or [[The Abbey, Skirwith]] in [[Cumberland]]. Basements, and consequently areas, decreased in popularity in the 19th century, as attitudes to servants changed, although they continued to be constructed as service accommodation in urban settings where land was at a premium until the early 20th century.  A suburban residential application can be seen at the [[Gamble House (Pasadena, California)|Gamble House]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], California, to light the laundry and service areas of the expansive basement.

In early 18th-century house descriptions, the area was usually called the "airy", which suggests that its primary function was ventilation, needed to prevent cooking smells from percolating upstairs to the rooms above.  This implies that the term "area" was a corruption of "airey" rather than vice versa.&lt;ref name=candb&gt;D. Cruickshank and N. Burton, ''Life in the Georgian city'', 1990, pp.52-53, 83-85&lt;/ref&gt;

==Airey==
In [[North London]], it was known colloquially as "the airey". It is a subject of an old-time children's ball-bouncing rhyme, which begins: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"One, two, three, alairy &lt;br&gt;
My ball is down the airey &lt;br&gt;
Don't forget to give it to Mary&lt;br&gt;
Early in the morning".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Chr. Michelsen Institute.jpg|thumb|Chr. Michelsen Institute in Bergen]]
The '''Chr. Michelsens Institutt for Videnskap og Åndsfrihet''' (CMI) was founded in 1930, and is currently the largest centre for development research in Scandinavia.  In 1992, the Department for Natural Science and Technology established the ''Christian Michelsen Research AS'', and the CMR Group.(cmr.no) The University of Bergen is the main owner in The CMR Group. The Department of Social Science and Development became the Chr. Michelsen Institute. CMI is an independent, non-profit research foundation for policy-oriented and applied development research. Headed by the director Ottar Mæstad, it employs 40 social scientists, primarily anthropologists, economists and political scientists. CMI receives core funding from the Norwegian Research Council (NFR) and project support from Norwegian state ministries and agencies, and Norwegian and international non-governmental organisations.

CMI hosts the [[Anti-Corruption Resource Centre]], also referred to as U4.

== Research and cooperation ==
The institute’s geographical focus is on [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], [[South Asia]], [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], and partly also [[South America]]. CMI focuses its research around ten thematic areas: [[Aid]], [[Global health]] and development, [[Governance]] and [[corruption]], [[Natural resources]], Peace and conflict, [[Rights]] and legal institutions, [[Public finance]] management, [[Poverty]] dynamics, [[Culture]]s and politics of [[faith]], and [[Gender]] relations from the local to the global.

CMI has formal cooperation agreements with various research institutions in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Through institutional cooperation CMI facilitates joint research and projects, institutional development and competence building. In Norway, CMI has close formal institutional collaborations with the [[University of Bergen]] (UiB) and the [[Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration]] (NHH), including teaching, joint research projects and support to graduate students and PhD candidates.

== History ==
[[Image:Christian Michelsen.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Christian Michelsen]]
Founded in 1930, the Chr. Michelsen Institute is named after Norwegian statesman [[Christian Michelsen]] (1857-1925). Michelsen bequeathed a large part of his fortune to the establishment of a foundation for science and intellectual freedom. The Chr. Michelsen Institute was established on the founder's birthday, 15 March 1930. In his will, Michelsen specified four areas of priority: humanities, natural sciences, technology and medicine and "cultural and scientific work to foster tolerance between nations and races - religious, social, economic and political." It was the latter formulation that justified a subsequent focus on development issues. 

The economist [[Just Faaland]] and the political scientist [[Stein Rokkan]] initiated and developed broader research programmes and employed more people in the 1950s. They financed the expansion through participation in international research programmes and by mobilising other financial resources. In 1961 they had defined research programmes in international economics and comparative politics. In 1965, the Development Action and Research Programme (DERAP), a development economics project on growth problems in developing countries was formally established. The DERAP model combined research work at the Institute in Bergen with applied and practical work in developing countries, a model to which CMI still adheres. DERAP gradually recruited other social scientists in addition to the economists. In the early 1980s, Just Faaland established a Human Rights Programme which soon grew to become the other main focus in social science research. In 1992, the Department for Natural Science and Technology established the Christian Michelsen Research AS, and the CMR Group.(cmr.no) The University of Bergen is the main owner in CMR. The Department of Social Science and Development became the Chr. Michelsen Institute. DERAP and the Human Rights Programme merged, and research became the main objective. Practical work in developing countries is still important, but long term assignments are replaced by shorter missions and research-co-operation in the South. At the time of CMI’s 75th anniversary in 2005 the institution’s annual turnover was about NOK 55m.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24504">[[File:Diatoms through the microscope.jpg|thumb|right|Coexistence theory attempts to explain the [[paradox of the plankton]] -- how can ecologically similar species coexist without [[competitive exclusion|competitively excluding]] each other?]]

'''Coexistence theory''' is a framework to understand how competitor traits can maintain [[species diversity]] and stave-off [[competitive exclusion]] even among [[Guild (ecology)|similar species]] living in ecologically similar environments. Coexistence theory explains the stable coexistence of species as an interaction between two opposing forces: [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] differences between species, which should drive the best-adapted species to exclude others within a particular [[ecological niche]], and stabilizing mechanisms, which maintains diversity via [[niche differentiation]]. For many species to be stabilized in a community, population growth must be negative [[density-dependent inhibition|density-dependent]], i.e. all participating species have a tendency to increase in density as their populations decline. In such communities, any species that becomes rare will experience positive growth, pushing its population to recover and making local extinction unlikely. As the population of one species declines, individuals of that species tend to compete predominantly with individuals of other species. Thus, the tendency of a population to recover as it declines in density reflects reduced [[interspecific competition]] (between-species) relative to [[intraspecific competition]] (within-species), the signature of [[niche differentiation]] (see [[competitive Lotka-Volterra equations|Lotka-Volterra competition]]).

==Types of coexistence mechanisms==
Two qualitatively different processes can help species to coexist: a reduction in average [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] between species or an increase in [[niche differentiation]] between species. These two factors have been termed equalizing and stabilizing mechanisms, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Mechanisms of maintenance of species diversity|last = Chesson|first = Peter|journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|doi = 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.31.1.343|pmid = |access-date = |issue = |year = 2000|volume = 31|pages = 343–366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#''Equalizing mechanisms'' reduce fitness differences between species, or relative competitive ability in the absence of niche differentiation. As its name implies, it works by making similar species more equal in their competitive ability. For example, when multiple species compete for the same resource, competitive ability is determined by the minimum level of resources a species needs to maintain itself (known as an R*, or [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]] resource density).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Resources: A Graphical-Mechanistic Approach to Competition and Predation|journal = The American Naturalist|date = 1980-09-01|pages = 362–393|volume = 116|issue = 3|first = David|last = Tilman|doi=10.1086/283633|jstor=2463311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the species with the lowest R* is the best competitor and excludes all other species in the absence of any niche differentiation. Any factor that reduces R*s between species (like increased harvest of the dominant competitor) is classified as an equalizing mechanism. For species to coexist, fitness differences must be overcome by stabilizing mechanisms.
#''Stabilizing mechanisms'' promote coexistence by concentrating [[intraspecific competition]] relative to [[interspecific competition]]. There are large number of named stabilizing mechanisms including classical hypotheses of species coexistence. [[Resource partitioning]], whereby interspecific competition is reduced because species compete primarily through different resources, is a stabilizing mechanism. Similarly, if species are differently affected by environmental variation (e.g., soil type, rainfall timing, etc.), this can create a stabilizing mechanism (see [[Storage effect|the storage effect]]). Stabilizing mechanisms increase the low-density growth rate of all species.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

A general way of measuring the effect of stabilizing mechanisms is by calculating the [[Population growth rate|growth rate]] of species ''i'' in a community as&lt;ref name="Chesson2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chesson |first=Peter

&lt;math&gt;\hat{r_i} = b_i ( k_i - \hat{k} + A )&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:*&lt;math&gt;\hat{r_i}&lt;/math&gt; is the long-term average growth rate of the species ''i'' when at low density. Because species are limited from growing indefinitely, viable populations have an average long-term growth rate of zero. Therefore, species at low-density can increase in abundance when their long-term average growth rate is positive. 
:*&lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; is a species-specific factor that reflects how quickly species ''i'' responds to a change in competition. For example, species with faster generation times may respond more quickly to a change in resource density than longer lived species. In an extreme scenario, if ants and elephants were to compete for the same resources, elephant population sizes would change much more slowly to changes in resource density than would ant populations.
:*&lt;math&gt;k_i - \hat{k}&lt;/math&gt; is the difference between the fitness of species ''i'' when compared to the average fitness of the community excluding species ''i''. In the absence of any stabilizing mechanisms, species ''i'' will only have a positive growth rate if its fitness is above its average competitor, i.e. where this value is greater than zero.
:*&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; measures the effect of all stabilizing mechanisms acting within this community.

=== Example calculation: Species competing for resource ===
{{technical| section|date=June 2017}}  
In 2008 Chesson and Kuang showed how to calculate fitness differences and stabilizing mechanisms when species compete for shared resources and competitors. Each species ''j'' captures resource type ''l'' at a species-specific rate, ''c&lt;sub&gt;jl&lt;/sub&gt;.'' Each unit of resource captured contributes to species growth by value ''v&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''. Each consumer requires resources for the metabolic maintenance at rate ''μ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The interaction between predation and competition|url = http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature07248|journal = Nature|date = 2008-01-01|volume = 456|issue = 7219|doi = 10.1038/nature07248|first = Peter|last = Chesson|first2 = Jessica J.|last2 = Kuang|pmid=19005554|pages=235–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction, consumer growth is decreased by attack from predators. Each predator species ''m'' attacks species ''j'' at rate ''a&lt;sub&gt;jm&lt;/sub&gt;.''

Given predation and resource capture, the density of species ''i'', ''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;,'' grows at rate

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{N_j}\frac{dN_j}{dt} = \sum_l c_{jl}v_lR_l - \sum_m a_{jm}P_m - \mu_j&lt;/math&gt;

where ''l'' sums over resource types and ''m'' sums over all predator species. Each resource type exhibits logistic growth with intrinsic rate of increase, ''r&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;'', and carrying capacity, ''K&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/α&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;'', such that growth rate of resource ''l'' is

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{R_l}\frac{dR_l}{dt} = r^R_l \left( 1-\alpha^R_lR_l \right) - \sum_jc_{jl}N_j.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, each predator species ''m'' exhibits logistic growth in the absence of the prey of interest with intrinsic growth rate ''r&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' and carrying capacity ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''P''&lt;/sup&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/α&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.'' The growth rate of a predator species is also increased by consuming prey species where again the attack rate of predator species m on prey ''j'' is ''a&lt;sub&gt;jm&lt;/sub&gt;''. Each unit of prey has a value to predator growth rate of ''w.'' Given these two sources of predator growth, the density of predator ''m'', ''P&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'', has a per-capita growth rate

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{P_m}\frac{dP_m}{dt}=r^P_m(1-\alpha^P_mP_m) + \sum_j wN_ja_{jm}&lt;/math&gt;

where the summation terms is contributions to growth from consumption over all ''j'' focal species. The system of equations describes a model of trophic interactions between three sets of species: focal species, their resources, and their predators.

Given this model, the average fitness of a species ''j'' is

&lt;math&gt;k_j = \frac{1}{b_j}\left(\sum_{l=1} c_{jl} v_l K^R_l - \sum_m a_{jm}K^P_m - \mu_i \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the sensitivity to competition and predation is

&lt;math&gt;b_j = \sqrt{\left( \sum_l \frac{c^2_{jl}v_lK_l^R}{r^R_l} + \sum_m \frac{a^2_{jm}wK^P_m}{r^P_m} \right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The average fitness of a species takes into account growth based on resource capture and predation as well as how much resource and predator densities change from interactions with the focal species.

The amount of niche overlap between two competitors ''i'' and ''j'' is

&lt;math&gt;\rho = \left(\sum_l \frac{c_{il}v_lc_{jl}}{\alpha_l^Rr^R_l} + \sum_m \frac{a_{im}wa_{jm}}{\alpha_m^Pr^P_m}\right)/b_ib_j,&lt;/math&gt;

which represents the amount to which [[resource consumption]] and predator attack are linearly related between two competing species, ''i'' and ''j''.

This model  conditions for coexistence can be directly related to the general coexistence criterion: intraspecific competition, ''α&lt;sub&gt;jj&lt;/sub&gt;,'' must be greater than interspecific competition, ''α&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;.'' The direct expressions for intraspecific and interspecific competition coefficients from the interaction between shared predators and resources are

&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{jj} = s_j/k_j&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{ij} = \rho s_j/k_i.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, when intraspecific competition is greater than interspecific competition,

&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{jj} &gt; \alpha_{ij} = \frac{s_j}{k_j} &gt; \rho \frac{s_j}{k_i}&lt;/math&gt;

which, for two species leads to the coexistence criteria

&lt;math&gt;\rho &lt; \frac{k_1}{k_2} &lt; \frac{1}{\rho}.&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that, in the absence of any niche differences (i.e. ''ρ'' = 1), species cannot coexist.

==Stabilizing mechanisms==
In 1994, Chesson proposed that all stabilizing mechanisms could be categorized into four categories.&lt;ref name="Chesson2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1006/tpbi.2000.1486| title = General Theory of Competitive Coexistence in Spatially-Varying Environments| journal = Theoretical Population Biology| volume = 58| issue = 3| pages = 211–37| year = 2000| last1 = Chesson | first1 = P. | pmid=11120650}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chesson1994&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chesson|first1=Peter|title=Multispecies Competition in Variable Environments|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=June 1994|volume=45|issue=3|pages=227–276|doi=10.1006/Tpbi.1994.1013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and it is possible for all four to operate in any environment at a given time.

# ''Variation-independent mechanisms'' (also called ''fluctuation-independent mechanisms'') are any stabilizing mechanism that functions within a local place and time.&lt;ref name=Chesson2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chesson1994 /&gt; [[Niche differentiation#Types of niche differentiation|Resource partitioning]], [[Niche differentiation#Types of niche differentiation|predator partitioning]], and [[prey switching|frequency-dependent predation]] are three classic examples of variation-independent mechanisms. When a species is at very low density, individuals gain an advantage, because they are less constrained by competition across the landscape. For example, under frequency-dependent predation, a species is less likely to be consumed by predators when they are very rare.
# The ''[[storage effect]]'' occurs when species are affected differently by environmental variation in space or time.&lt;ref name=Chesson2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chesson1994 /&gt; For example, coral reef fishes have different reproductive rates in different years, plants grow differently in different soil types, and desert annual plants germinate at different rates in different years. When a species is at low density, individuals gain an advantage because they experience less competition in times or locations that they grow best. For example, if annual plants germinate in different years, then when it is a good year to germinate, species will be competing predominately with members of the same species. Thus, if a species becomes rare, individuals will experience little competition when they germinate whereas they would experience high competition if they were abundant. For the storage effect to function, species must be able to "store" the benefits of a productive time period or area, and use it to survive during less productive times or areas.&lt;ref name=Chesson&amp;Warner1981&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chesson|first1=Peter|last2=Warner|first2=Robert|title=Environmental Variability Promotes Coexistence in Lottery Competitive Systems|journal=The American Naturalist|date=1981|volume=117|issue=6|pages=923–943|doi=10.1086/283778}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can occur, for example, if species have a long-lived adult stage, a seed bank or diapause stage, or if they are spread out over the environment.
# A ''[[fitness-density covariance]]'' occurs when species are spread out non-uniformly across the landscape.&lt;ref name=Chesson2000 /&gt; Most often, it occurs when species are found in different areas. For example, mosquitoes often lay eggs in different locations, and plants who [[habitat partitioning|partition habitat]] are often found predominately where they grow best. Species can gain two possible advantages by becoming very rare. First, because they are physically separated from other species, they mainly compete with members of the same species (and thus experience less competition when they become very rare). Second, species are often more able to concentrate in favorable habitat as their densities decline. For example, if individuals are territorial, then members of an abundant species may not have access to ideal habitat; however, when that species becomes very rare, then there may be enough ideal habitat for all of the few remaining individuals.
# ''[[Relative nonlinearity]]'' occurs when species benefit in different ways from variation in competitive factors.&lt;ref name=Chesson2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chesson1994 /&gt; For example, two species might coexist if one can grows better when resources are rare, and the other grows better when resources are abundant. Species will be able to coexist if the species which benefits from variation in resources tends to reduce variation in resources. For example, a species which can rapidly consume excess resources tends to quickly reduce the level of excess resources favoring the other species, whereas a species which grows better when resources are rare is more likely to cause fluctuations in resource density favoring the other species.&lt;ref name=Armstrong&amp;McGehee1980&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=Robert A.|last2=McGehee|first2=Richard|title=Competitive Exclusion|journal=The American Naturalist|date=February 1980|volume=115|issue=2|pages=151–170|doi=10.1086/283553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empirical evidence==
A 2012 study&lt;ref name="HilleRisLambers2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110411-160411| title = Rethinking Community Assembly through the Lens of Coexistence Theory| journal = Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics| volume = 43| pages = 227–248| year = 2012| last1 = HilleRisLambers | first1 = J.| last2 = Adler | first2 = P.

M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; reviewed different approaches which tested coexistence theory, and identified three main ways to separate the contributions of stabilizing niche and relative fitness differences within a community. These are:

# '''Experimental manipulations''', which involved determining the effect of relative fitness or stabilizing mechanisms by manipulating resources or competitive advantages.
# '''Trait-Phylogeny-Environment relationships''', in which the phylogeny of members of a set of communities can be tested for evidence of trait clustering, which would suggest that certain traits are important (and perhaps necessary) to thrive in that environment, or trait [[overdispersion]], which would suggest a high ability of species to exclude close relatives. Such tests have been widely used, although they have also been criticized as simplistic and flawed.&lt;ref name="Mayfield2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01509.x| title = Opposing effects of competitive exclusion on the phylogenetic structure of communities| journal = Ecology Letters| volume = 13| issue = 9| pages = 1085–93| year = 2010| last1 = Mayfield | first1 = M. M. | last2 = Levine | first2 = J. M. | pmid=20576030}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# '''Demographic analyses''', which can be used to recognize frequency- or density-dependent processes simply by measuring the number and per-capita growth rates of species in natural communities over time. If such processes are operating, the per-capita growth rate would vary with the number of individuals in species comprising the community.

A 2010 review&lt;ref name=Seipielski&amp;McPeek2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seipielski|first1=Adam|last2=McPeek|first2=Mark|title=On the evidence for species coexistence: A critique of the coexistence program|journal=Ecology|date=2010|volume=91|issue=11|pages=3153–3164|doi = 10.1890/10-0154.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that an ''invasion analysis'' should be used as the critical test of coexistence. In an invasion analysis, one species (termed the "invader") is removed from the community, and then reintroduced at a very low density. If the invader shows positive population growth, then it cannot be excluded from the community. If every species has a positive growth rate as an invader, then those species can stably coexist. An invasion analysis could be performed using experimental manipulation, or by parameterizing a mathematical model. The authors argued that in the absence of a full-scale invasion analysis, studies could show some evidence for coexistence by showing that a trade-off produced negative density-dependence at the population level. The authors reviewed 323 papers (from 1972 to May 2009), and claimed that only 10 of them met the above criteria (7 performing an invasion analysis, and 3 showing some negative-density dependence).

However, an important caveat is that invasion analysis may not always be sufficient for identifying stable coexistence. For example, [[priority effect]]s or [[Allee effect]]s may prevent species from successfully invading a community from low density even if they could persist stably at a higher density. Conversely, high order interactions in communities with many species can lead to complex dynamics following an initially successful invasion, potentially preventing the invader from persisting stably in the long term.&lt;ref name=Levine2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levine|first1=Jonathan|last2=Bascompte|first2=Jordi|last3=Adler|first3=Peter|last4=Allesina|first4=Stefano|title=Beyond pairwise mechanisms of species coexistence in complex communities|journal=Nature|date=2017|volume=546|issue=7656|pages=56–64|doi = 10.1038/nature22898}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an invader that can only persist when a particular resident species is present at high density could alter community structure following invasion such that that resident species' density declines or that it goes locally extinct, thereby preventing the invader from successfully establishing in the long term.

==Neutral theory and coexistence theory==

{{Main|Unified neutral theory of biodiversity}}

The 2008 [[Unified neutral theory of biodiversity|Neutral theory]] by [[Stephen Hubbell]]&lt;ref name=hubbell2008&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubbell|first1=Stephen P.|title=The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography (MPB-32)|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=9781400837526}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to model biodiversity through a migration-speciation-extinction balance, rather through selection.&lt;ref name=vellend2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vellend|first1=Mark|title=Conceptual synthesis in community ecology|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|date=2010|volume=85|issue=2|pages=183–206|doi=10.1086/652373}}&lt;/ref&gt; It assumes that all members within a [[Guild (ecology)|guild]] are inherently the same, and that changes in population density are a result of random births and deaths. Particular species are lost [[stochastic]]ally through a [[random walk]] process, but species richness is maintained via [[speciation]] or external migration. Neutral theory can be seen as a particular case of coexistence theory: it represents an environment where stabilizing mechanisms are absent (i.e., &lt;math&gt;A = 0&lt;/math&gt;), and there are no differences in average fitness (i.e., &lt;math&gt;k_i - \hat{k} = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all species).&lt;ref name=Adler_etal_2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adler|first1=Peter B.|last2=HilleRisLambers|first2=Janneke|last3=Levine|first3=Jonathan M.|title=A niche for neutrality|journal=Ecology Letters|date=February 2007|volume=10|issue=2|pages=95–104|doi=10.1111/J.1461-0248.2006.00996.X|url=https://zenodo.org/record/851708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been hotly debated how close real communities are to neutrality. Few studies have attempted to measure fitness differences and stabilizing mechanisms in plant communities, for example in 2009&lt;ref name=Levine_etal2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levine|first1=Jonathan M.|last2=HilleRisLambers|first2=Janneke|title=The importance of niches for the maintenance of species diversity|journal=Nature|date=12 August 2009|volume=461|issue=7261|pages=254–257|doi=10.1038/Nature08251}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in 2015 &lt;ref name=Chu_etal_2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chu|first1=Chengjin|last2=Adler|first2=Peter B.|title=Large niche differences emerge at the recruitment stage to stabilize grassland coexistence|journal=Ecological Monographs|date=August 2015|volume=85|issue=3|pages=373–392|doi=10.1890/14-1741.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These communities appear to be far from neutral, and in some cases,stabilizing effects greatly outweigh fitness differences.

==Cultural coexistence theory==

Cultural Coexistence Theory (CCT), also called [[Socio-ecological system|Social-ecological]] Coexistence Theory, expands on coexistence theory to explain how groups of people with shared interests in natural resources (e.g., a fishery) can come to coexist sustainably.&lt;ref name=Loring2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loring|first1=Philip A.|title=Toward a Theory of Coexistence in Shared Social-ecological Systems: The Case of Cook Inlet Salmon Fisheries|journal=Human Ecology|date=23 January 2016|volume=44|issue=2|pages=153–165|doi=10.1007/s10745-016-9806-0|pmc=4832003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural Coexistence Theory draws on work by anthropologists such as Frederik Barth and [[Environmental anthropology#Transformations|John Bennett]], both of whom studied the interactions among culture groups on shared landscapes. In addition to the core ecological concepts described above, which CCT summarizes as limited similarity, limited competition, and resilience, CCT argues the following features are essential for cultural coexistence:

# ''[[Adaptability]]'' describes the ability of people to respond to change or surprise. It is essential to CCT because it helps capture the importance of human agency.
# ''[[Cultural pluralism|Pluralism]]'' describes where people value cultural diversity and recognize the fundamental rights of people not like them to live in the same places and access shared resources.
# ''[[Equity (economics)|Equity]]'' as used in CCT describes whether social institutions exist that ensure that people's basic human rights, including the ability to meet basic needs, are protected, and whether people are protected from being marginalized in society.

Cultural Coexistence Theory fits in under the broader area of [[sustainability science]], [[common pool resources]] theory, and [[conflict theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9798">According to Rieh (2005), "Patrick Wilson (1983) developed the '''cognitive authority''' theory from [[social epistemology]] in his book, ''Second-hand Knowledge: An Inquiry into Cognitive Authority''. The fundamental concept of Wilson’s cognitive authority is that people construct knowledge in two different ways: based on their first-hand experience or on what they have learned second-hand from others. What people learn first-hand depends on the stock of ideas they bring to the interpretation and understanding of their encounters with the world. People primarily depend on others for ideas as well as for information outside the range of direct experience. Much of what they think of the world is what they have gained second-hand. Wilson (1983) argues that all that people know of the world beyond the narrow range of their own lives is what others have told them. However, people do not count all hearsay as equally reliable; only those who are deemed to “know what they are talking about” become cognitive authorities. Wilson coined the term cognitive authority to explain the kind of authority that influences thoughts that people would consciously recognize being proper. Cognitive authority differs from administrative authority or the authority vented in a hierarchical position." (Rieh, 2005).

==Philosophical issues==
Wilson's dichotomy between first hand knowledge and second hand knowledge may be a trace left from empiricism. According to non-empiricist epistemologies such as hermeneutics and pragmatism even our first hand knowledge (our perception) is influenced by our culture and hence - mostly indirectly and unconsciously - by cognitive authorities: the way we learn to look at things when brought up in a culture and socialized into a subculture and a domain.

The concept of cognitive authority is important because it forces us to be [[skeptical]] towards claims in the literature and elsewhere. It forces us to consider the criteria we should use when evaluating information [[:wikt:source|source]]s. In other words: It forces us to consider [[epistemological]] issues.

Different "movements", "paradigms", "positions" or "schools" in a given field tend to have different cognitive authorities. 
 
"Most people, even most academics, do not have the time, training, or occasion to work through the technical literature on a controversial topic, and so, they must rely on professionals for a disinterested evaluation" (Herrnstein, 1973, pp.&amp;nbsp;52,53; quoted from Tucker, 1994). Tucker shows, however, that the recognized experts within the field of intelligence research blindly accepted [[Cyril Burt]]'s research even though it was without scientific value and probably directly faked: They wanted to believe that [[IQ]] was hereditary, and considered uncritically empirical claims supporting this view. When a researcher from another field ([[Leon Kamin]]) first demonstrated that Burt's results were wrong, he was not considered a cognitive authority. When his criticism was considered unavoidable, the established researchers tried to change history and deprive Kamin of his intellectual credit. This example shows something about how cognitive authority may be ascribed in the real world.  
 
The concept of cognitive authority also raises the question of the role of experts. On the one hand, it is dangerous to blindly believe claims originating from "experts" while on the other hand, "commonsensism" is also a problematic epistemology. John Dewey (1920) discussed this dilemma and worked on improving general education in order to make the general public less vulnerable to the power of experts.

==Example: The cognitive authority of professional historians==
In about 1880, history was established as an academic discipline and as a profession based on that discipline in both Europe and the USA. The cognitive authority of history was closely related to the application of scientific methods and [[source criticism]]. A clear division was established between amateur historians and professional, scientific historians. From the dominant "paradigm" in the historical profession of that time, it was clear what to consider "cognitive authority".

However, inside history, the "paradigm" shifted to "the present period of confusion, polarization, and uncertainty, in which the idea of historical objectivity has become more problematic than ever before".&lt;ref&gt;(Novick, 1988, p. 16-17)&lt;/ref&gt;

For some the development has turned around and amateurs have the same cognitive authority as professional historians: "[I]t is not the purportedly objective investigations
of the historian into a real subject matter which lead to knowledge about history, but rather the
knowledge at which the historian arrives is conditioned
by the linguistic mode in which she/he operates.
Professional historiography for White [1973] generates no
more objective knowledge of the past than does speculative philosophy of history or the historical
novel." &lt;ref&gt;(Iggers, 2001, 6772)&lt;/ref&gt;

What is considered "cognitive authority" in a given field of knowledge is thus relative and depending on the "paradigm" of the information seeker. An argument about what should be regarded "cognitive authority" is in the end an epistemological argument.

==Implications for library and information science==
The concept of cognitive authority was developed in [[library and information science]] and has attracted a lot of attention in this field. Its importance for this field is related to questions such as: What criteria should be used for selecting information sources? For advising users about selecting information? For interpreting user studies and relevance judgments? All such issues involve questions of cognitive authority and epistemology.

"Perhaps we [library and information professionals] should learn to be more critical of the very concept of authority. Authority is legitimate only within the boundaries of the community (subject or otherwise) in which it is based. Many questions pertain to areas claimed by competing disciplines, and some to areas beyond the bounds of recognized disciplinary communities. Even when we are able to locate authoritative sources with answers to questions, they tend to be less certain than they look, and greater authority is no guarantee of quality. Authority tells us only that the creators of the source have qualifications and institutional affiliations that match the expectations of a given disciplinary community, not that the source is infallible, or even that its disciplinary community is the best to pursue the information sought" (Pierce, 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;31).

A '''corner solution''' is a special solution to an [[Agent (economics)|agent]]'s [[Maximization (economics)|maximization]] problem in which the quantity of one of the arguments in the maximized function is [[0 (number)|zero]]. In non-technical terms,:3 a corner solution is when the chooser is either unwilling or unable to make a tradeoff.  In economics when someone says "I wouldn't buy that at any price" or "I will do X no matter the cost", those are corner solutions.  Another example is "zero-tolerance" policies, or parents who are unwilling to expose their children to any risk, no matter how small and no matter what the benefits of the activity might be.  "Nothing is more important than my child's safety" is a corner solution in its refusal to admit there might be tradeoffs.  The term "corner solution" is sometimes used by economists in a more colloquial fashion to refer to these sorts of situations.  The word "corner" refers to the fact that if one graphs the maximization problem, the optimal point will occur at the "corner" created by the budget constraint and one axis.

A corner solution is an instance where the "best" solution (i.e. maximizing profit, or utility, or whatever value is sought) is achieved based not on the market-efficient maximization of related quantities, but rather based on brute-force boundary conditions. Such a solution lacks [[mathematical elegance]], and most examples are characterized by externally forced conditions (such as "variables ''x'' and ''y'' cannot be negative") that put the actual [[local extrema]] outside the permitted values.

The more usual solution will lie in the non-zero interior at the point of tangency between the [[objective function]] and the constraint. For example, in [[consumer theory]] the objective function is the [[indifference curve|indifference-curve]] map (the [[utility function]]) of the consumer.  The budget line is the constraint.  In the usual case, constrained utility is maximized on the budget constraint with strictly positive quantities consumed of both goods.  For a corner solution, however, utility is maximized at a point on one axis where the budget constraint intersects the highest attainable indifference curve at zero consumption for one good with all income used for the other good.  Furthermore, a range of lower prices for the good with initial zero consumption may leave quantity demanded unchanged at zero, rather than increasing it as in the more usual case.

Another technical way to state it is that a corner solution is a solution to a minimization or maximization problem where the non-corner solution is infeasible, that is, not in the domain. Instead, the solution is a corner solution on an axis where either ''x'' or ''y'' is equal to zero. For instance, from the example above in economics, if the maximal utility of two goods is achieved when the quantity of goods ''x'' and ''y'' are (−2,&amp;nbsp;5), and the utility is subject to the constraint ''x'' and ''y'' are greater than or equal to 0 (one cannot consume a negative quantity of goods) as is usually the case, then the actual solution to the problem would be a corner solution where ''x'' = 0.

The '''Council of Presidents''' is the executive leadership body of the [[Vermont State Colleges System]] (VSCS), the governance organization for public colleges in the U.S. state of [[Vermont]]. The council is composed of a chancellor and executive staff of the VSCS and the presidents of the four member colleges. The council works with the Board of Trustees of the Vermont State Colleges to set policies and procedures for the system.

The members of the Council of Presidents currently are: VSCS Chancellor [[Jeb Spaulding]]; President Karen Scolforo, [[Castleton University]], President Joyce Judy, [[Community College of Vermont]]; President Elaine C. Collins, [[Northern Vermont University]]; President Patricia Moulton, the [[Vermont Technical College]]; and VSC General Counsel William Reedy, Chief Financial Officer Thomas Robbins, Chief Academic Officer Annie Howell, and Director of Community Relations and Public Policy Dan Smith.

'''Dance education''' is the transferring of [[dance]] performance skills and knowledge of dance to [[students]] through teaching and [[training]], or acquiring such knowledge and skills through [[research]].

==Curriculum==
In general, a dance education [[curriculum]] is designed to impart dance performance skills, or knowledge of dance, or both to students. Knowledge-oriented curricula may cover any of a diverse range of topics, including [[dance notation]], [[human anatomy]], [[physics]], [[dance history]], and cultural aspects of dance.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

A curriculum may involve the study of one or more dance genres, including formal genres such as [[ballet]], [[ballroom dancing|ballroom]], [[contemporary dance|contemporary]], [[jazz dance|jazz]], [[Latin dancing|Latin]], and [[tap dance|tap]] dance, and informal and social genres such as [[line dancing|line]], [[freestyle dance|freestyle]], and [[sequence dancing|sequence]] dancing.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

==Professional dance education==
Professional and [[vocational education|vocational]] dance education is offered by both public and private institutions. Private institutions, which are commonly known as dance schools or dance colleges, are typically focused on dance education, whereas public institutions usually cover a broad range of topics. Examples of private institutions include the [[Royal Ballet School]] and the [[School of American Ballet]].

Many public and private universities and colleges offer minor programs in dance, or major programs with academic degrees such as [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]], and [[Master of Fine Arts]] in dance. Some public [[secondary education]] institutions offer comprehensive dance education curricula. For example, [[Jefferson High School (Portland, Oregon)]] offers concentrated vocational dance education in conjunction with its pre-professional dance company, [[The Jefferson Dancers]].

Discovered by [[Diana Deutsch]] in 1973, '''Deutsch's "scale illusion"''' is an [[auditory illusion]] in which principles of grouping by [[frequency]], [[proximity space|proximity]], and spatial [[Sound localization|location]] are put into conflict and in which frequency proximity wins out.&lt;ref&gt;Bregman, Albert (1994). ''Auditory Scene Analysis: The Perceptual Organization of Sound'', p.76. {{ISBN|0-262-52195-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is produced by simultaneous ascending and descending [[major scale]]s beginning in separate [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] channels with each successive [[note (music)|note]] being switched to the opposite [[stereo channel|channel]]. With the left channel: C'-D-A-F--A-D-C'; and the right: C-B-E-G-E-B-C; the ear hears both: C'-B-A-G--A-B-C'; and: C-D-E-F--E-D-C. The tones are equal-amplitude [[sine wave]]s, and the sequence is played [[repeat sign|repeatedly]] without [[rest (music)|pause]] at a rate of four tones per second. (Listen to the Stereo Sound Example linked below.)

When listening to the illusion over [[headphone]]s, most [[handedness|right-handers]] hear a [[melody]] corresponding to the higher tones as on the right and a melody corresponding to the lower tones as on the left. When the earphone positions are reversed, the higher tones continue to appear to be coming from the right and the lower tones from the left. Other people experience different illusions, such as the higher tones on the left and the lower tones on the right, or a pattern in which the sounds appear to be localized in different and changing ways. [[Right-handedness|Right-handers]] and [[Left-handedness|left-handers]] differ statistically in how the scale illusion is perceived.

In a clinical study, patients with [[hemispatial neglect]] were shown to experience the scale illusion. Further, in an MEG study on normal listeners the scale illusion was found to be neurally represented at or near the auditory cortex.

More precisely, it is a documentary mixed with fictional elements,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tesionline.it/default/tesi.asp?idt=18073 Il difficile rapporto tra fiction e non fiction che si concretizza nella docu-fiction] (The difficult relationship between fiction and non-fiction patent in docufiction) – thesis in Italian by Laura Marchesi, Faculty of Communication Sciences (Università degli Studi di Pavia) at [http://www.tesionline.it/default/index.asp Tesionline], 2005/06&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Real time (media)|real time]], filmed when the events take place, and in which the main [[character (arts)|character]] or characters — often portrayed by non-professional or amateur actors — are essentially playing themselves, or slightly fictionalized versions of themselves, in a fictionalized scenario.

==Origins==
The term involves a way of making films already practiced by such authors as [[Robert Flaherty]], one of the fathers of documentary,&lt;ref&gt;[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma01/huffman/frontier/define.html Definition of documentary – New Frontiers in American documentary] (American Studies at The University of Virginia)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transartinstitute.org/Example_Papers.html The Impulse of Documentary-Fiction]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319052930/http://www.transartinstitute.org/Example_Papers.html |date=March 19, 2012 }} – Paper at [http://www.transartinstitute.org/About.html Transart Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831101542/http://transartinstitute.org/About.html |date=2011-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean Rouch]], later in the 20th century.

In the domain of [[visual anthropology]], the innovating role of Jean Rouch&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rouge.com.au/3/rouch_valediction.html Jean Rouch 1917-2004, A Valediction] – Article by [[Michael Eaton]] at [http://www.rouge.com.au/ Rouge]&lt;/ref&gt; allows one to consider him as the father of a subgenre called [[ethnofiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maitres-fous.net/glossary.html Glossary] at MAITRES_FOUS.NET&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean Rouch and the Genesis of Ethnofiction, thesis by Brian Quist, Long Island University&lt;/ref&gt; This term means: [[ethnographic]] documentary film with natives who play fictional roles. Making them play a role about themselves will help portray reality, which&lt;ref&gt;"Ethnofiction: drama as a creative research practice in ethnographic film." Journal of Media Practice 9, no. 3(2008), eScholarID:1b5648, article by Johannes Sjöberg&lt;/ref&gt; will be reinforced with [[imagery]]. A non-ethnographic [[documentary]] with fictional elements uses the same method and, for the same reasons, may be called docufiction.

==Docudrama and mockumentary==
In contrast, [[docudrama]] is usually a fictional and dramatized recreation&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.sadibey.com/dosyalar/Gerekli_Seyler/Documentary_Genres.doc Docudrama: the real (his)tory Confusion of genres] – Page 2 on the thesis by Çiçek Coşkun (New York University School of Education)&lt;/ref&gt; of factual events in form of a documentary, at a time subsequent to the "real" events it portrays. A docudrama is often confused with ''docufiction'' when [[drama]] is considered interchangeable with [[fiction]] (both words meaning the same). However, "docudrama" refers specifically to [[Television film|telefilms]] or other television media recreations that dramatize certain events often with [[actor]]s.
 	
A [[mockumentary]] is also a film or television show in which fictitious events are presented in documentary format, sometimes a recreation of factual events after they took place or a comment on [[current events]], typically satirical, comedic or even dramatic.&lt;ref&gt;A television programme or film which takes the form of a serious documentary in order to satirize its subject. – definition at The Free Dictionary and Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas mockumentaries are usually fully scripted comedies or dramas that merely adopt some aspects of documentary format as a framing device, docufictions are usually not scripted, instead placing the participants in a fictionalized scenario while portraying their own genuine reactions and their own [[improvisation]]al dialogue and character development.

}}

'''''Don't Make Me Think''''' is a book by [[Steve Krug]] about [[human–computer interaction]] and [[web usability]]. The book's premise is that a good [[software]] program or web site should let users accomplish their intended tasks as easily and directly as possible. Krug points out that people are good at [[satisficing#Decision making|satisficing]], or taking the first available solution to their problem, so design should take advantage of this. He frequently cites [[Amazon.com]] as an example of a well-designed web site that manages to allow high-quality interaction, even though the web site gets bigger and more complex every day.

The book itself is intended to be an example of [[concision]] (brevity) and well-focused writing. The goal, according to the book's introduction, was to make a text that could be read by an executive on a two-hour airplane flight.

Originally published in 2000, the book was revised in 2005 and 2013 and has sold more than 300,000 copies.

In 2010, the author published a sequel, ''Rocket Surgery Made Easy'', which explains how anyone working on a web site, mobile app, or desktop software can do their own usability testing to ensure that what they're building will be usable.

The '''Greater London Industrial Archaeology Society'''  ('''GLIAS''') is the  [[industrial archaeology]] society for the [[Greater London]] area.

== Origins and Responsibilities==
Founded in 1968&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glias.org.uk/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; by individuals who had been involved in the [[Thames Valley Observation Group]], it quickly established itself as the leading industrial archaeological and [[industrial history]] group in the London Area.

It is a member of the [[South East Regional Industrial Archaeological Conference]], the [[Association for Industrial Archaeology]], and the [[The International Committee for the Conservation of the Industrial Heritage|TICCIH]].  It also works together with more locally directed history groups and projects supporting individual conservation projects, as well as raising industrial historical issues with national [[UK]] organisations such as [[English Heritage]] and the [[Royal Fine Art Commission]].

In addition it comments on [[planning applications]] and developments likely to have an effect on the survival of industrial structures.  In this remit it acts as a [[statutory consultee]].

Its membership is crossed with many other similar organisations and bodies that have similar objectives such as the [[King's Cross Conservation Area Advisory Committee]], the [[Newcomen Society]] and the [[Association for Industrial Archaeology]].

== Activities ==
Every year it organises a series of half-a-dozen lectures (held in Central London) on industrial archaeology.  It provides a bi-monthly newsletter, which is still produced as [[hard copy]] in an [[A4 (paper size)|A4]] [[Gestetner]] form. It also hosts a series of popular walks around sites of industrial archaeological importance in London, often hosted by people who are expert about the matters in question.

An occasional journal is produced.

== Database ==
In the early 1990s  AIA developed a national standardised method for collecting industrial archaeology data. The result was the [[Index Record for Industrial Sites|IRIS]] (Index Record for Industrial Sites) booklet and forms, published in 1993.

In 1998, GLIAS began to develop a database which  could used to record site information in London.          The intention was to make the database compatible with the IRIS data standard, and the first version was essentially an electronic IRIS form.

An early version was demonstrated to a special committee of the society, the  Recording Group  and this was later presented to the AIA. This was favourably  received and the database has been in development ever since. In 2002 the society received  an award from them.

==Horticultural botanists==
Professional horticultural [[botanist]]s are employed by [[botanical garden]]s, large [[Plant nursery|plant nurseries]], university departments, and government agencies. The activities vary according to the mission goals and priorities of the institutions. 
:Duties can include: 
*searching for new plants suitable for cultivation (''plant hunting''), 
*communicating with and advising the general public on matters concerning the classification and [[botanical nomenclature]] of cultivated plants, 
*carrying out original research on these topics: 
**describing the cultivated plants and their history of particular regions in [[horticultural flora]]s,  
**recording new plant introductions; 
*maintaining [[database]]s of cultivated plants; 
*curating horticultural [[herbarium|herbaria]], including collections of dried specimens and images; 
*contributing to the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]]''. 

==Taxonomy of cultivated plants==
Perhaps the single major concern of horticultural botanists has been the [[taxonomy of cultivated plants]] and so, at the present time, many horticultural botanists will be members if the ''International Association of Cultivated Plant Taxonomy'' which was established in 2007.

'''Immunodermatology''' studies [[skin]] as an organ of [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] in health and disease. Several areas have special attention, such as photo-immunology (effects of [[Ultraviolet|UV]] light on skin defense), [[inflammation|inflammatory]] diseases such as [[Hidradenitis suppurativa]], [[allergy|allergic]] contact [[dermatitis]] and [[atopic eczema]], presumably [[autoimmune]] skin diseases such as [[vitiligo]] and [[psoriasis]], and finally the [[immunology]] of [[microbial]] skin diseases such as [[retrovirus]] infections and [[leprosy]]. New therapies in development for the [[Immunosuppressant|immunomodulation]] of common immunological skin diseases include [[Biomolecule|biologicals]] aimed at neutralizing [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha|TNF-alfa]] and [[chemokine receptor]] inhibitors.

[[File:Itztalbruecke_2005-07-24.jpg|right|thumb|Incrementally-launched bridge construction [[Itz]] [[:de:Itztalbrücke (A73)|Valley Bridge]] near [[Coburg]]]]
'''Incremental launch''' is a method of building a complete bridge deck from one end of the bridge only.

==History==
The first incrementally-launched bridge was the 96 metre span [[Caroní River Bridge]], a [[box girder bridge]] over the [[Caroní River]] in 1964. 

The normal method of building [[concrete bridge]]s is the segmental method, one span at a time.

==Method==
The bridges are mostly of the box girder design and work with straight or [[Constant curvature|constant curve]] shapes, with a constant radius. 15 to 30 metre box girder sections of the [[Deck (bridge)|bridge deck]] are fabricated at one end of the bridge in factory conditions. Each section is manufactured in around one week.

The first section of the launch is not made of concrete, but is a [[Stiffening|stiffened]] steel [[Plate girder bridge|plate girder]] and is around 60% of the length of a bridge span, and reduces the [[cantilever]] moment.

The sections of bridge deck slide over sliding bearings, which are concrete blocks covered with [[stainless steel]] and reinforced [[Elastomer|elastomeric pad]]s.

Tribhuvan University's '''Institute of Agriculture and Animal Science''' (IAAS) is the oldest institute in [[Nepal]] which provides higher education in agriculture and [[animal science]].

=={{anchor|Background|Present scenario}}Overview==

IAAS was founded in [[Kathmandu]] in 1957 as a school of agriculture to train junior technical assistants. In 1968, the school was upgraded to a college of agriculture. Four years later it became affiliated with  Tribhuvan University (TU), and moved to [[Bharatpur, Nepal|Rampur, Chitwan]] in 1974. The institute's mission is to provide higher education in agriculture and agricultural development, focusing on teaching, research, and [[continuing education]]. The government of Nepal established the Agriculture and Forestry University (AFU) in Rampur in 2010, and AFU took over IAAS' physical plant and other assets. The IAAS dean's office moved to Kathmandu in 2011 and continues its programs and activities at satellite offices in [[Sanepa]], [[Lalitpur, Nepal|Lalitpur]] and [[Kirtipur]].

The institute's postgraduate program was moved to Kathmandu in 2013, and classes are conducted in TU's Research Centre for Applied Science and Technology (RECAST) building in Kirtipur and other TU classrooms. It has a Master of Science in Agriculture (M. Sc. Ag.) program in seven departments, Master of Science in Animal Science (M.Sc. An. Sc.) and Master of Veterinary Science (M. V. Sc.) programs in two, and two Ph.D. programs (Plan A and Plan B) in several departments. In Plan A, students attend theory and practical classes in relevant subjects offered by the department. In Plan B, students conduct research and submit a progress report each semester; classes and practical work are not mandatory. 

The institute has collaborated with the TU central library in Kirtipur, and student access to the library has been ensured. It has donated a number of postgraduate reference books, and the library has committed to obtain books and other publications required by IAAS students. In addition to maintaining its laboratory, the institute has signed in an agreement with the Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC) for student practical work and research activities. The institute has involved TU professors and researchers and other governmental and non-governmental organizations.

[[Image:Lamjung campus.jpg|thumb|alt=Narrow street with buildings on both sides|Lamjung campus]]
[[Image:Lamjung view.jpg|thumb|alt=Terraced fields, with mountains in the background|View from Lamjung]]
The Paklihawa campus is in [[Siddharthanagar]], and the Lamjung campus is in [[Sundarbazar]]. They were established as branches of the central Rampur campus in 1976 (2032 [[Vikram Samvat|B.S.]]) with the following objectives:
* To produce mid-level agricultural technicians
* To conduct relevant, problem-solving agricultural and animal-science research for farmers
* To provide technical assistance in agriculture and animal science to farmers

With the establishment of AFU at IAAS, Rampur, both satellite IAAS campuses (Lamjung and Paklihawa, which had two-year programs) were upgraded to B.Sc.Ag. programs in 2012. The Paklihawa campus began a five-year B.V.Sc. program in 2013.

==Affiliated colleges==

TU and IAAS became affiliated with agricultural colleges in [[Gokuleshwar, Baitadi]] (2010), [[Lamahi Municipality]] and [[Tulsipur, Dang]] (both 2014).

Tribhuvan University's other technical institutes are:
* [[Institute of Engineering]]
* [[Institute of Forestry]]
* [[Institute of Medicine, Nepal|Institute of Medicine]]
* [[Institute of Science and Technology, TU|Institute of Science and Technology]]

== {{anchor|Links with other institutions}}Links to other institutions ==
[[Memorandum of understanding|Memoranda of understanding]] have been signed between IAAS and national and international institutions, including the [[International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center]] (CIMMYT), Agro Enterprise Centre (AEC), [[Ministry of Agricultural and Livestock Development (Nepal)|Ministry of Agricultural and Livestock Development]], Nepal Agriculture Research Council (NARC), [[International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development]], [[Cornell University]], [[University of Graz]], [[Hiroshima University]], [[Writtle College]], [[Asian Institute of Technology]] and [[Tufts University]].

== {{anchor|Land holdings}}Land ==
The institute has 338 [[bigha|ropani]] (229 [[hectare]]s) of land in six plots. It has one horticulture, one [[agronomy]] and one livestock farm covering 252 ropani (171 hectares). The farms produce fruit, vegetables, cereals, animals and birds and are used for practical work. The upland farm includes a mango orchard, and about 4,200 coffee plants were planted in August 2005.

== Administration and staff ==
The campus chief is the head of the institute for general and academic administration, accounts, store, library, farms, hostels and dispensary work. There is a branch head of each section, responsible for internal management. Major decisions related to rules and regulations in each section are made by section heads and related personnel, headed by the campus chief.

There are 150 teaching staff members, and 56 in administrative support. Two teachers have Ph.D. degrees, and others hold master's degrees. Four teachers have been brought from Rampur on a contract basis each year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1786">In [[astrophysics]] and [[statistical mechanics]], '''Jeans's theorem''', named after [[James Jeans]], states that any steady-state solution of the collisionless [[Boltzmann equation]] depends on the phase space coordinates only through [[constant of motion|integrals of motion]] in the given potential, and conversely any function of the integrals is a steady-state solution.

Jeans's theorem is most often discussed in the context of potentials characterized by three, global integrals. In such potentials, all of the orbits are regular, i.e. non-[[chaos theory|chaotic]]; the [[Orbital elements|Kepler potential]] is one example. In generic potentials, some orbits respect only one or two integrals and the corresponding motion is chaotic. Jeans's theorem can be generalized to such potentials as follows:&lt;ref name=DEGN&gt;{{cite book|last=Merritt|first=David|author-link=David Merritt|title=Dynamics and Evolution of Galactic Nuclei|date=2013|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-0-691-12101-7|lccn=2013936624|pages=67–68|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL16802359W/Dynamics_and_Evolution_of_Galactic_Nuclei}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The phase-space density of a stationary stellar system is constant within every well-connected region.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A well-connected region is one that cannot be decomposed into two finite regions such that all trajectories lie, for all time, in either one or the other. [[Invariant torus|Invariant tori]] of regular orbits are such regions, but so are the more complex parts of phase space associated with chaotic trajectories. Integrability of the motion is therefore not required for a steady state.

The '''''Journal of Moral Theology''''' is a [[Academic journal|journal]] that publishes [[peer-reviewed]] scholarly articles in the field of [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] moral [[theology]]. The journal is published [[semiannual|semi-annually]], with regular issues in January and June, that cover theological treatments of related topics in [[philosophy]], [[economics]], [[political philosophy]], and [[psychology]]. Articles published in the journal undergo at least two double blind peer reviews before being selected for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Moral Theology|volume=6|issue=2|url=http://digitalarchives.msmary.edu/digital/collection/JMT/id/68/rec/1 |title=Engaging Disability|accessdate=December 4, 2017|publisher=[[Mount St. Mary's University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The journal was established by David Matzko McCarthy of [[Mount St. Mary's University]], then the Fr. James M. Forker Professor of [[Catholic Social Teaching]]. He received considerable assistance from Joshua Hochschild, who was the Mount’s Dean of the College of [[Liberal Arts]] at that time, and from David Cloutier and William Mattison III, who edited the inaugural issue (January 2012). McCarthy’s work on the journal started in early in 2009, and by the end of the year, an intrepid editorial board was formed.
 
The initial board membership was constituted by Melanie Barrett, University of St. Mary of the Lake/Mundelein Seminary; Joseph Capizzi, The Catholic University of America; David Cloutier, The Catholic University of America; Kelly Johnson, University of Dayton; M. Therese Lysaught, Loyola University Chicago; Bryan Massingale, Fordham University; William C. Mattison III, University of Notre Dame; Jeanne Heffernan Schindler, John Paul II Institute; Christopher P. Vogt, St. John’s University. The affiliations noted are current (not 2012). David McCarthy is the Associate Provost at Mount St. Mary’s University.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, David M. ''The History of the Journal of Moral Theology.'' [[Mount St. Mary's University]]. December 4, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Jason King took on the role of associate editor, and in 2017, he became the editor. Dr. King is the chair of the Department of Theology, St. Vincent College, Latrobe, PA. The managing editor is Kathy Criasia, Dean's Assistant, the College of Liberal Arts, Mount St. Mary's University. William College is the associate editor; he is Emeritus Professor of Theology and Philosophy, Mount St. Mary's University.

'''Large marine ecosystems (LMEs)''' are regions of the world's [[ocean]]s, encompassing coastal areas from river basins and [[estuary|estuaries]] to the seaward boundaries of [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] and the outer margins of the major [[ocean current]] systems. They are relatively large regions on the order of 200,000&amp;nbsp;km² or greater, characterized by distinct [[bathymetry]], [[hydrography]], [[primary production|productivity]], and [[trophic level|trophically]] dependent [[population]]s. Productivity in LME protected areas is generally higher than in the open ocean.

The system of LMEs has been developed by the US [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) to identify areas of the oceans for conservation purposes. The objective is to use the LME concept as a tool for enabling [[ecosystem-based management]] to provide a collaborative approach to management of resources within ecologically-bounded transnational areas. This will be done in an international context and consistent with customary international law as reflected in 1982 [[United Nations|UN]] [[Convention on the Law of the Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lme.noaa.gov NOAA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the LMEs cover mostly the continental margins and not the deep oceans and oceanic islands, the 66 LMEs produce about 80% of global annual marine fishery [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lme.noaa.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1:lme-introduction&amp;catid=14&amp;Itemid=112|title=LME Introduction|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, LMEs contribute $12.6 trillion&lt;ref&gt;Costanza R, d'Arge R, Groots Rd, Farber S, Grasso M, Hannon B, Limburg K, Naeem S, O'Neill RV, Paruelo J and others. 1997. The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital. Nature 387:253-260.&lt;/ref&gt; in goods and services each year to the global economy. Due to their close proximity to developed coastlines, LMEs are in danger of [[ocean pollution]], [[overexploitation]], and coastal habitat alteration. NOAA has conducted studies of principal driving forces affecting changes in biomass yields for 33 of the 66 LMEs, which have been peer-reviewed and published in ten volumes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lme.noaa.gov NOAA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

LME-based conservation is based on recognition that the world’s coastal ocean waters are degraded by unsustainable fishing practices, [[habitat degradation]], [[eutrophication]], toxic pollution, aerosol contamination, and emerging diseases, and that positive actions to mitigate these threats require coordinated actions by governments and civil society to recover depleted fish populations, restore degraded habitats and reduce coastal pollution. Five modules are considered when assessing LMEs: productivity, fish and fisheries, pollution and ecosystem health, socioeconomics, and governance.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen SB, Sutinen JG, Juda L, Hennessey TM, Grigalunas TA. 2006. A Handbook on Governance and Socioeconomics of Large Marine Ecosystems. Kingston, RI: Coastal Resources     Center, University of Rhode Island. 94 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Periodically assessing the state of each module within a marine LME is encouraged to ensure maintained health of the ecosystem and future benefit to managing governments.&lt;ref&gt;Wang H. 2004. An evaluation of the modular approach to the assessment and management of large marine ecosystems. Ocean Development and International Law 35:267-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modules of Ecosystem Condition ==

=== Productivity ===

The productivity of a marine ecosystem can be measured in several ways. Measurements pertaining to zooplankton biodiversity and species composition, zooplankton biomass, water-column structure, photosynthetically active radiation, transparency, chlorophyll-a, nitrate, and primary production are used to assess changes in LME productivity and potential fisheries yield.&lt;ref&gt;Pauly D, Christensen V. 1995. Primary production required to sustain global fisheries. Nature 374:255-257.&lt;/ref&gt; Sensors attached to the bottom of ships or deployed on floats can measure these metrics and be used to quantitatively describe changes in productivity alongside physical changes in the water column such as temperature and salinity.&lt;ref&gt;Aiken J, Pollard R, Williams R, Griffiths G, Bellan I. 1999. Measurements of the upper ocean structure using towed profiling systems. In: Sherman K, Tang Q, editors. Large marine ecosystems of the Pacific Rim: Assessment, sustainability, and management. Malden, MA: Blackwell Science, Inc. p 346-362.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berman MS, Sherman K. 2001. A towed body sampler for monitoring marine ecosystems. Sea Technology 42(9):48-52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SAHFOS. 2008. Annual Report 2007. Plymouth, UK: The Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science.&lt;/ref&gt; This data can be used in conjunction with satellite measurements of chlorophyll and sea surface temperatures to validate measurements and observe trends on greater spatial and temporal scales.

=== Fish and Fisheries ===

Bottom-trawl surveys and pelagic-species acoustic surveys are used to assess changes in fish biodiversity and abundance in LMEs. Fish populations can be surveyed for stock identification, length, stomach content, age-growth relationships, fecundity, coastal pollution and associated pathological conditions, as well as multispecies trophic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Sea Around Us Project at www.seaaroundus.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Fish trawls can also collect sediment and inform us about ocean-bottom conditions such as anoxia.

=== Pollution and Ecosystem Health ===

Pollution and eutrophication can have significant impacts on ecosystem health and result in changing biomass yields. LMEs are emplaced in an effort to maintain healthy and sustainable conditions in spite of environmental change and global warming. A health ecosystem should maintain a relatively constant metabolic activity level, internal structure and organization, making it resistant to change over time.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza R. 1992. Toward an operational definition of ecosystem health. In: Costanza R, Norton BG, Haskell BD, editors. Ecosystem health: New goals for environmental management. Washington, DC: Island Press. p 239-256.&lt;/ref&gt; Health is assessed on both a population and species level. Observations are made pertaining to bioaccumulation of contaminants, frequency of harmful algal blooms and diseases, water column contents and water quality, reproductive capacity and more.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman B. 2000. Marine ecosystem health as an expression of morbidity, mortality, and disease events. Marine Pollution Bulletin 41(1-6):232-54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sherman BH. 2001. Assessment of multiple marine ecological disturbances: Applying the North American prototype to the Baltic Sea Ecosystem. Human and Ecological Risk Assessment 7(5):1519-1540.&lt;/ref&gt;  Eutrophication and nutrient overloading can be measured as a function of nitrogen and phosphate in a given location.&lt;ref&gt;Seitzinger S, Sherman K, Lee R. 2008. Filling Gaps in LME Nitrogen Loadings Forecast for 64 LMEs, Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Technical Series 79. Paris, France: UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socioeconomic ===

By integrating socioeconomic metrics with ecosystem management solutions, scientific findings can be utilized to benefit both the environment and economy of local regions. Management efforts must be practical and cost-effective. The Department of Natural Resource Economics at the University of Rhode Island has created a method for measuring and understanding the human dimensions of LMEs and for taking into consideration both socioeconomic and environmental costs and benefits of managing Large Marine Ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Sutinen J, ed. 2000. A framework for monitoring and assessing socioeconomics and governance of large marine ecosystems. NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS-NE-158:32p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutinen, J.G. , P. Clay, C.L. Dyer, S.F. Edwards, J. Gates, T. Grigalunas, T. Hennesey, L. Juda, A.W. Kitts, P. Thunberg, H.R. Upton, and J.B. Walden. 2005. A framework for monitoring and assessing socioeconomics and governance of large marine ecosystems. 27-81 In, Hennessey, T.M. and J.G. Sutinen (Editors), Sustaining Large Marine Ecosystems: The human dimension. Elsevier.368p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duda, A.M.. 2005.Targeting development assistance to meet WSSD goals for large marine ecosystems and small island developing states. Ocean &amp; Coastal Management 48:1014&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially important in island nations and small states which depend heavily on fisheries production for income.

=== Governance  ===

[[File:Global map of large marine ecosystems.jpg|thumb|Global map of large marine ecosystems. Oceanographers and biologists have identified 66 LMEs worldwide.]]The Global Environment Facility (GEF)  aids in managing LMEs off the coasts of Africa and Asia by creating resource management agreements between environmental, fisheries, energy and tourism ministers of bordering countries. This means participating countries share knowledge and resources pertaining to local LMEs to promote longevity and recovery of fisheries and other industries dependent upon LMEs.&lt;ref&gt;Juda L, Hennessey T. 2001. Governance profiles and the management of the uses of large marine ecosystems. Ocean Development and International Law 32:41-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

As [[University of Central Florida]] engineering students, the Limbitless Solutions team began the first project at the [[university]] campus manufacturing lab in 2014. The organization used a donated [[Stratasys]] Dimension 3D Printer and other supplies to create an affordable prosthetic, to minimize cost and time of traditional manufacturing processes like [[CNC milling]].&lt;ref name=" Stratasys, 3d printed prosthetic arm "&gt;[http://blog.stratasys.com/2015/08/05/3d-printed-prosthetic-arm/ Stratasys, 3d printed prosthetic arm] Stratasys, 3d printed prosthetic arm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" CNN, UCF 3D printed arms for kids "&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/06/health/ucf-3d-printed-arms-for-kids/ CNN, UCF 3D printed arms for kids] CNN, UCF 3D printed arms for kids&lt;/ref&gt; Built in the student's free time, their first arm used a 3D printer running with off-the-shelf [[servos]] and batteries that were activated by the [[electromyography]] muscle energy on a child’s limb.&lt;ref name=" UCF, Fulfilling 6 years olds dream ucf students design build arm "&gt;[http://today.ucf.edu/fulfilling-6-year-olds-dream-ucf-students-design-build-arm/ UCF, Fulfilling 6 years olds dream ucf students design build arm] UCF, Fulfilling 6 years olds dream ucf students design build arm&lt;/ref&gt; Most prosthetic arms are [[machine (mechanical)|mechanical]], which presents a challenge for children without elbows. With mechanical arms, the child opens and closes their hand by bending their elbow. The students came up with the idea for an electronic arm with a muscle sensor that allows the child to open and close their hand by flexing their [[biceps]].&lt;ref name=" CNN, UCF 3D printed arms for kids "/&gt;

== Production ==

When producing a prosthesis, the child is measured (size of residual limb, length of limb, etc.) and the model of the arm is then appropriately scaled and adjusted before being printed, assembled, and fitted. [[Electromyography]] (EMG) sensors are calibrated before the arm is ready for use.&lt;ref name="What is the general process of making an arm FAQ Limbitless"&gt;[http://limbitless-solutions.org/faqs/ What is the general process of making an arm FAQ Limbitless] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421094737/http://www.limbitless-solutions.org/faqs/ |date=2015-04-21 }} What is the general process of making an arm FAQ Limbitless&lt;/ref&gt;
The time to fabricate one bionic arm ranges depending on several factors, the most influential being the type of [[amputation]]. The time to build a helper hand is 4–6 weeks, and a bionic arm without an elbow is 8–12 weeks. In addition to partial arms, Limbitless has said it has plans to make full arms with elbows as well as legs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5140">The '''log wind profile''' is a semi-empirical relationship commonly used to describe the vertical distribution of horizontal mean wind speeds within the lowest portion of the [[planetary boundary layer]].  The relationship is well described in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Oke, T.R.|title=Boundary Layer Climates|edition=|publisher=Methuen|year=1987|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] profile of wind speeds is generally limited to the lowest 100 m of the atmosphere (i.e., the [[surface layer]] of the [[atmospheric boundary layer]]). The rest of the atmosphere is composed of the remaining part of the planetary boundary layer (up to around 1000 m) and the troposphere or free atmosphere.  In the free atmosphere, geostrophic wind relationships should be used.

==Definition==
The equation to estimate the mean wind speed (&lt;math&gt;u_z&lt;/math&gt;) at height &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; (meters) above the ground is:
&lt;CENTER&gt;
&lt;math&gt;u_z = \frac{u_*}{\kappa} \left[\ln \left(\frac{z-d}{z_0} \right) + \psi(z,z_0,L)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/CENTER&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;u_*&lt;/math&gt; is the [[friction velocity]] (m s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Von Kármán constant]] (~0.41), &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the zero plane displacement (in metres), &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Roughness Length|surface roughness]] (in meters), and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|stability]] term where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Monin-Obukhov length|Obukhov length]] from [[Monin-Obukhov similarity theory]]. Under [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|neutral stability]] conditions, &lt;math&gt;z/L = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; drops out and the equation is simplified to,
&lt;CENTER&gt;
&lt;math&gt;u_z = \frac{u_*}{\kappa} \left[\ln \left(\frac{z-d}{z_0} \right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/CENTER&gt;

Zero-plane displacement (&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;) is the height in meters above the ground at which zero wind speed is achieved as a result of flow obstacles such as trees or buildings.  It can be approximated as &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of the average height of the obstacles.&lt;ref name="Holmes2015"&gt;Holmes JD. Wind Loading of Structures. 3rd ed. Boca Raton, Florida: CRC Press; 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if estimating winds over a forest canopy of height 30 m, the zero-plane displacement could be estimated as d = 20 m.

Roughness length (&lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt;) is a corrective measure to account for the effect of the roughness of a surface on wind flow.  That is, the value of the roughness length depends on the terrain.  The exact value is subjective and references indicate a range of values, making it difficult to give definitive values. In most cases, references present a tabular format with the value of &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; given for certain terrain descriptions. For example, for very flat terrain (snow, desert) the roughness length may be in the range 0.001 to 0.005 m.&lt;ref name="Holmes2015"/&gt;  Similarly, for open terrain (grassland) the typical range is 0.01-0.05 m.&lt;ref name="Holmes2015"/&gt;  For cropland, and brush/forest the ranges are 0.1-0.25 m and 0.5-1.0 m respectively. When estimating wind loads on structures the terrains may be described as suburban or dense urban, for which the ranges are typically 0.1-0.5 m and 1-5 m respectively.&lt;ref name="Holmes2015"/&gt;

In order to estimate the mean wind speed at one height (&lt;math&gt;{{z}_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;) based on that at another (&lt;math&gt;{{z}_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;), the formula would be rearranged,&lt;ref name="Holmes2015"/&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;
&lt;math&gt;u({{z}_{2}})=u({{z}_{1}})\frac{\ln \left( ({{z}_{2}}-d)/{{z}_{0}} \right)}{\ln \left( ({{z}_{1}}-d)/{{z}_{0}} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;/CENTER&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;u({{z}_{1}})&lt;/math&gt; is the mean wind speed at height &lt;math&gt;{{z}_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Limits==
The log wind profile is generally considered to be a more reliable estimator of mean wind speed  than the [[wind profile power law]] in the lowest 10–20 m of the planetary boundary layer. Between 20 m and 100 m both methods can produce reasonable predictions of mean wind speed in neutral atmospheric conditions. From 100 m to near the top of the atmospheric boundary layer the power law produces more accurate predictions of mean wind speed (assuming neutral atmospheric conditions).&lt;ref name="Cook, N.J. 1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cook, N.J.|title=The designer's guide to wind loading of building structures: Part 1|edition=|publisher=Butterworths|year=1985|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neutral atmospheric stability assumption discussed above is reasonable when the hourly mean wind speed at a height of 10 m exceeds 10&amp;nbsp;m/s where turbulent mixing overpowers atmospheric instability.&lt;ref name="Cook, N.J. 1985"/&gt;

==Applications==
Log wind profiles are generated and used in many [[atmospheric dispersion modeling|atmospheric pollution dispersion models]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''meridian circle''' is an instrument for timing of the passage of [[star]]s across the local [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]], an event known as a [[culmination]], while at the same time measuring their angular distance from the [[nadir]]. These are special purpose [[telescope]]s mounted so as to allow pointing only in the  [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]], the [[great circle]] through the north point of the horizon, the [[zenith]], the south point of the horizon, and the [[nadir]]. Meridian telescopes rely on the rotation of the Earth to bring objects into their [[field of view]] and are mounted on a fixed, horizontal, east–west axis.

The similar '''transit instrument''', '''transit circle''', or '''transit telescope''' is likewise mounted on a horizontal axis, but the axis need not be fixed in the east–west direction. For instance, a surveyor's [[theodolite]] can function as a transit instrument if its telescope is capable of a full revolution about the horizontal axis. Meridian circles are often called by these names, although they are less specific.

For many years, transit timings were the most accurate method of measuring the positions of heavenly bodies, and meridian instruments were relied upon to perform this painstaking work. Before [[spectroscopy]], [[photography]], and the perfection of [[reflecting telescope]]s, the measuring of positions (and the deriving of [[orbit]]s and [[Astronomical constant#Table of astronomical constants|astronomical constants]]) was the major work of [[observatory|observatories]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Importance==
[[File:Meridian circle 01.JPG|thumb|Meridian circle at Saint Petersburg Kunstkamera, built by T.L. Ertel, Germany, 1828]]

Fixing a telescope to move only in the [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] has advantages in the high-precision work for which these instruments are employed:
*The very simple mounting is easier to manufacture and maintain to a high precision.
*At most locations on the Earth, the meridian is the only [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] in which [[Celestial coordinate system|celestial coordinates]] can be indexed directly with such a simple mounting; the [[equatorial coordinate system]] aligns naturally with the meridian at all times. Revolving the telescope about its axis moves it directly in [[declination]], and objects move through its field of view in [[right ascension]].
*All objects in the sky are subject to the distortion of [[atmospheric refraction]], which tends to make objects appear slightly higher in the sky than they actually are. At the meridian, this distortion is in [[declination]] only, and is easily accounted for; elsewhere in the sky, refraction causes a complex distortion in coordinates which is more difficult to reduce. Such complex analysis is not conducive to high precision.

==Basic instrument==

The state of the art of meridian instruments of the late 19th and early 20th century is described here, giving some idea of the precise methods of construction, operation and adjustment employed.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===

The earliest transit [[telescope]] was not placed in the middle of the axis, but nearer to one end, to prevent the axis from bending under the [[weight]] of the telescope. Later, it was usually placed in the centre of the axis, which consisted of one piece of [[brass]] or [[gun metal]] with turned cylindrical steel pivots at each end. Several instruments were made entirely of [[steel]], which was much more rigid than brass. The pivots rested on V-shaped [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], either set into massive stone or brick piers which supported the instrument, or attached to metal frameworks on the tops of the piers. The temperature of the bearings was monitored by thermometers.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The piers were usually separate from the foundation of the building, to prevent transmission of vibration from the building to the telescope. To relieve the pivots from the weight of the instrument, which would have distorted their shape, each end of the axis was supported by a hook with [[friction rollers]], suspended from a [[lever]] supported by the pier, [[Counterweight|counterbalanced]] so as to leave only about 10 [[pounds force]] (45 [[Newton (unit)|N]]) on each bearing. In some cases, the counterweight pushed up on the bearing from below.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, Bond and Winlock (1876), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The bearings were set nearly in a true east–west line, but fine adjustment was possible by horizontal and vertical screws. A [[spirit level]] was used to monitor for any inclination of the axis to the horizon. Eccentricity (an off-center condition) of the telescope's axis was accounted for, in some cases, by providing another telescope through the axis itself. By observing the motion of an artificial star through this axis telescope as the main telescope was rotated, the shape of the pivots, and any wobble of the axis, could be determined.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, Bond and Winlock (1876), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Transit circle microscope.png|thumb|Top view of a circle-reading microscope; from Norton (1867).]]

Near each end of the axis, attached to the axis and turning with it, was a circle or wheel for measuring the [[angle]] of the telescope to the horizon. Generally of 3&amp;nbsp;[[Foot (unit)|feet]] to 3.5&amp;nbsp;ft diameter, it was divided to 2 or 5 [[Minute of arc|arcminutes]], on a slip of silver set into the face of the circle near the circumference. These [[Graduation (instrument)|graduations]] were read by [[microscope]]s, generally four for each circle, mounted to the piers or a framework surrounding the axis, at 90° intervals around the circles. By averaging the four readings the eccentricity (from inaccurate centering of the circles) and the errors of graduation were greatly reduced. Each microscope was furnished with a [[micrometer]] screw, which moved [[crosshair]]s, with which the distance of the circle graduations from the centre of the field of view could be measured. The drum of the screw was divided to measure single seconds of arc (0.1" being estimated), while the number of revolutions were counted by a kind of comb in the field of view. The microscopes were placed at such a distance from the circle that one revolution of the screw corresponded to 1 arcminute (1') on the circle. The error was determined occasionally by measuring standard intervals of 2' or 5' on the circle. The periodic errors of the screw were accounted for. On some instruments, one of the circles was graduated and read more coarsely than the other, and was used only in finding the target stars.

The telescope consisted of two tubes screwed to the central cube of the axis. The tubes were usually conical and as stiff as possible to help prevent [[bending|flexure]]. The connection to the axis was also as firm as possible, as flexure of the tube would affect [[declination]]s deduced from observations. The flexure in the horizontal position of the tube was determined by two [[collimator]]s - telescopes placed horizontally in the meridian, north and south of the transit circle, with their [[Objective (optics)|objective lenses]] towards it. These were pointed at one another (through holes in the tube of the telescope, or by removing the telescope from its mount) so that the crosshairs in their foci coincided. The collimators were often permanently mounted in these positions, with their objectives and eyepieces fixed to separate piers.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, Bond and Winlock (1876), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The meridian telescope was pointed to one collimator and then the other, moving through exactly 180°, and by reading the circle the amount of flexure (the amount the readings differed from 180°) was found. Absolute flexure, that is, a fixed bend in the tube, was detected by arranging that [[eyepiece]] and objective lens could be interchanged, and the average of the two observations of the same star was free from this error.

Parts of the apparatus were sometimes enclosed in glass cases to protect them from dust. These cases had openings for access. Other parts were closed against dust by removable silk covers.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, Bond and Winlock (1876), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain instrumental errors could be averaged out by reversing the telescope on its mounting. A carriage was provided, which ran on rails between the piers, and on which the axis, circles and telescope could be raised by a screw-jack, wheeled out from between the piers, turned 180°, wheeled back, and lowered again.

The observing building housing the meridian circle did not have a rotating dome, as is often seen at observatories. Since the telescope observed only in the meridian, a vertical slot in the north and south walls, and across the roof between these, was all that was necessary. The building was unheated and kept as much as possible at the temperature of the outside air, to avoid air currents which would disturb the telescopic view. The building also housed the clocks, recorders, and other equipment for making observations.

===Operation===
At the [[Focus (optics)|focal plane]], the eye end of the telescope had a number of vertical and one or two horizontal wires ([[crosshair]]s). In observing stars, the telescope was first directed downward at a basin of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] forming a perfectly horizontal mirror and reflecting an image of the crosshairs back up the telescope tube. The crosshairs were adjusted until coincident with their reflection, and the line of sight was then perfectly vertical; in this position the circles were read for the ''[[nadir]] point''.

The telescope was next brought up to the approximate [[declination]] of the target star by watching the finder circle. The instrument was provided with a clamping apparatus, by which the observer, after having set the approximate declination, could clamp the axis so the telescope could not be moved in declination, except very slowly by a fine [[Screw (simple machine)|screw]]. By this slow motion, the telescope was adjusted until the star moved along the horizontal wire (or if there were two, in the middle between them), from the east side of the field of view to the west. Following this, the circles were read by the microscopes for a measurement of the apparent [[Horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] of the star. The difference between this measurement and the nadir point was the ''nadir distance'' of the star. A movable horizontal wire or declination-micrometer was also used.

Another method of observing the apparent [[Horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] of a star was to take half of the angular distance between the star observed directly and its reflection observed in a basin of mercury. The average of these two readings was the reading when the line of sight was horizontal, the ''horizontal point'' of the circle. The small difference in [[latitude]] between the telescope and the basin of mercury was accounted for.

The vertical wires were used for observing transits of stars, each wire furnishing a separate result. The time of transit over the middle wire was estimated, during subsequent analysis of the data, for each wire by adding or subtracting the known interval between the middle wire and the wire in question. These known intervals were predetermined by timing a star of known declination passing from one wire to the other, the [[pole star]] being best on account of its slow motion.

Timings were originally made by an "eye and ear" method, estimating the interval between two beats of a clock. Later, timings were registered by pressing a key, the electrical signal making a mark on a [[Chart recorder|strip recorder]]. Later still, the eye end of the telescope was usually fitted with an ''impersonal [[micrometer]]'', a device which allowed matching a vertical crosshair's motion to the star's motion. Set precisely on the moving star, the crosshair would trigger the electrical timing of the meridian crossing, removing the observer's [[personal equation]] from the measurement.&lt;ref&gt;
Chauvenet (1868), p. 138, art. 121
&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of the wires could be illuminated; the lamps were placed at some distance from the piers in order not to heat the instrument, and the light passed through holes in the piers and through the hollow axis to the center, whence it was directed to the eye-end by a system of [[Prism (optics)|prism]]s.

To determine absolute declinations or polar distances, it was necessary to determine the observatory's [[colatitude]], or distance of the [[celestial pole]] from the [[zenith]], by observing the upper and lower culmination of a number of [[circumpolar star]]s. The difference between the circle reading after observing a star and the reading corresponding to the zenith was the zenith distance of the star, and this plus the colatitude was the north polar distance. To determine the zenith point of the circle, the telescope was directed vertically downwards at a basin of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], the surface of which formed an absolutely horizontal mirror. The observer saw the horizontal wire and its reflected image, and moving the telescope to make these coincide, its optical axis was made perpendicular to the plane of the horizon, and the circle reading was 180°&amp;nbsp;+ zenith point.

In observations of stars [[Atmospheric refraction|refraction]] was taken into account as well as the errors of graduation and flexure. If the bisection of the star on the horizontal wire was not made in the centre of the field, allowance was made for curvature, or the deviation of the star's path from a great circle, and for the inclination of the horizontal wire to the horizon. The amount of this inclination was found by taking repeated observations of the zenith distance of a star during the one transit, the pole star being the most suitable because of its slow motion.

Attempts were made to record the transits of a star photographically. A [[photographic plate]] was placed in the focus of a transit instrument and a number of short exposures made, their length and the time being registered automatically by a clock. The exposing shutter was a thin strip of steel, fixed to the armature of an electromagnet. The plate thus recorded a series of dots or short lines, and the vertical wires were photographed on the plate by throwing light through the objective lens for one or two seconds.

Meridian circles required precise adjustment to do accurate work.&lt;ref&gt;
Norton (1867), p. 33ff
&lt;/ref&gt;

The rotation axis of the main telescope needed to be exactly horizontal. A sensitive [[spirit level]], designed to rest on the pivots of the axis, performed this function. By adjusting one of the V-shaped bearings, the bubble was centered.

The line of sight of the telescope needed to be exactly perpendicular to the axis of rotation. This could be done by sighting a distant, stationary object, lifting and reversing the telescope on its bearings, and again sighting the object. If the crosshairs did not intersect the object, the line of sight was halfway between the new position of the crosshairs and the distant object; the crosshairs were adjusted accordingly and the process repeated as necessary. Also, if the rotation axis was known to be perfectly horizontal, the telescope could be directed downward at a basin of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and the crosshairs illuminated. The mercury acted as a perfectly horizontal mirror, reflecting an image of the crosshairs back up the telescope tube. The crosshairs could then be adjusted until coincident with their reflection, and the line of sight was then perpendicular to the axis.

The line of sight of the telescope needed to be exactly within the plane of the meridian. This was done approximately by building the piers and the bearings of the axis on an east–west line. The telescope was then brought into the meridian by repeatedly timing the (apparent, incorrect) upper and lower meridian transits of a [[circumpolar star]] and adjusting one of the bearings horizontally until the interval between the transits was equal. Another method used calculated meridian crossing times for particular stars as established by other observatories. This was an important adjustment, and much effort was spent in perfecting it.

In practice, none of these adjustments were perfect. The small errors introduced by the imperfections were mathematically corrected during the analysis of the data.

==Zenith telescopes==
{{main|Zenith telescope}}
Some telescopes designed to measure star transits are [[zenith telescope]]s designed to point straight up at or near the [[zenith]] for extreme precision measurement of star positions. They use an [[altazimuth mount]], instead of a meridian circle, fitted with leveling screws. Extremely sensitive levels are attached to the telescope mount to make angle measurements and the telescope has an eyepiece fitted with a [[micrometer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Geodesy |volume=11 |first1=Alexander Ross |last1=Clarke |first2=Friedrich Robert |last2=Helmert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Overview===
The idea of having an instrument ([[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]) fixed in the plane of the meridian occurred even to the [[ancient history|ancient]] [[astronomy|astronomers]] and is mentioned by [[Ptolemy]], but it was not carried into practice until [[Tycho Brahe]] constructed a large meridian quadrant.

Meridian circles have been used since the 18th century to accurately measure positions of stars in order to [[Star catalogue|catalog]] them. This is done by measuring the instant when the star passes through the local meridian. Its [[altitude (astronomy)|altitude]] above the horizon is noted as well. Knowing one's geographic [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] these measurements can be used to derive the star's [[right ascension]] and [[declination]].

Once good star catalogs were available a transit telescope could be used anywhere in the world to accurately measure local longitude and time by observing local meridian transit times of catalogue stars. Prior to the invention of the [[atomic clock]] this was the most reliable source of accurate time.

===Antiquity===
In the ''[[Almagest]]'', Ptolemy describes a meridian circle which consisted of a fixed graduated outer ring and a movable inner ring with tabs that used a shadow to set the Sun's position. It was mounted vertically and aligned with the meridian. The instrument was used to measure the altitude of the Sun at noon in order to determine the path of the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ptolemy|first=Claudius|author2=Toomer, G. J. |authorlink2=G. J. Toomer |title=Ptolemy's Almagest|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|date=1998|isbn=0-691-00260-6|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
[[Image:20060825 Ole Rømer's Instruments.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The world's first meridian circle from [[Ole Rømer]]'s [[Observatorium Tusculanum]]]]A meridian circle enabled the observer to simultaneously determine [[right ascension]] and [[declination]], but it does not appear to have been much used for right ascension during the 17th century, the method of equal altitudes by portable quadrants or measures of the angular distance between stars with an [[sextant (astronomical)|astronomical sextant]] being preferred. These methods were very inconvenient, and in 1690, [[Ole Rømer]] invented the transit instrument.

===18th century===
The transit instrument consists of a horizontal axis in the direction east and west resting on firmly fixed supports, and having a [[telescope]] fixed at right angles to it, revolving freely in the plane of the meridian. At the same time Rømer invented the altitude and [[azimuth]] instrument for measuring vertical and horizontal angles, and in 1704, he combined a vertical circle with his transit instrument, so as to determine both co-ordinates at the same time.

This latter idea was, however, not adopted elsewhere, although the transit instrument soon came into universal use (the first one at [[Greenwich]] being mounted in 1721), and the [[mural quadrant]] continued until the end of the century to be employed for determining declinations. The advantages of using a whole circle, it being less liable to change its figure and not requiring reversal in order to observe stars north of the zenith, were then again recognized by [[Jesse Ramsden]], who also improved the method of reading off angles by means of a [[micrometer]] [[microscope]] as described below.

===19th century===
[[File:TransitCircle USNO.jpg|thumb|The 6-inch transit circle of the U.S. Naval Observatory, built by Warner and Swasey, 1898]]

The making of circles was shortly afterwards taken up by [[Edward Troughton]], who constructed the first modern transit circle in 1806 for [[Stephen Groombridge|Groombridge]]'s [[observatory]] at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]], the [[Groombridge Transit Circle]] (a meridian transit circle). Troughton afterwards abandoned the idea and designed the mural circle to take the place of the mural quadrant.

In the United Kingdom, the transit instrument and mural circle continued until the middle of the 19th century to be the principal instrument in observatories, the first transit circle constructed there being that at Greenwich (mounted in 1850). However, on the continent, the transit circle superseded them from the years 1818–1819, when two circles by [[Johann Georg Repsold]] and [[Georg Friedrich von Reichenbach]] were mounted at [[Göttingen]], and one by Reichenbach at [[Königsberg]]. The firm of Repsold and Sons was for a number of years eclipsed by that of [[Pistor and Martins]] in Berlin, who furnished various observatories with first-class instruments. Following the death of Martins, the Repsolds again took the lead and made many transit circles. The observatories of [[Harvard College]], [[Cambridge University]] and [[Edinburgh University]] had large circles by [[Troughton and Simms]].

The Airy Transit Circles at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] (1851) and that at the [[Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope]] (1855) were made by [[Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies|Ransomes and May]] of Ipswich. The Greenwich instrument had optical and instrumental work by Troughton and Simms to the design of [[George Biddell Airy]].

===20th century and beyond===
[[File:FASTT Transit Circle.jpg|thumb|200px|The Ron Stone/Flagstaff Astrometric Scanning Transit Telescope of the U.S.Naval Observatory, built by Farrand Optical Company, 1981]]

A modern-day example of this type of telescope is the 8&amp;nbsp;inch (~0.2m) Flagstaff Astrometric Scanning Transit Telescope (FASTT) at the [[United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station|USNO Flagstaff Station Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nofs.navy.mil/about_NOFS/telescopes/fastt.html&lt;/ref&gt; Modern meridian circles are usually automated. The observer is replaced with a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] camera. As the sky drifts across the field of view, the image built up in the CCD is clocked across (and out of) the chip at the same rate. This allows some improvements:&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The CCD can collect light for as long as the image is crossing it, allowing a dimmer limiting [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] to be reached.
*The data can be collected for as long as the telescope is in operation - an entire night is possible, allowing a strip of sky many degrees in length to be scanned.
*Data can be compared directly to any reference object which happens to be within the scan - usually a bright extragalactic object, like a [[quasar]], with an accurately-known position. This eliminates the need for some of the painstaking adjustment of the meridian instrument, although monitoring of [[declination]], [[azimuth]], and [[Horizontal plane|level]] is still performed with CCD scanners and [[Interferometry|laser interferometers]].
*[[Atmospheric refraction]] can be accounted for automatically, by monitoring [[temperature]], [[pressure]], and [[dew point]] of the [[air]] electronically.
*Data can be [[Computer data storage|stored]] and analyzed at will.

The first automated instrument was the [[Carlsberg Automatic Meridian Circle]], which came online in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~dwe/SRF/camc.html  The Carlsberg Meridian Telescope] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528070240/http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~dwe/SRF/camc.html |date=2010-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NK-92®️, a proprietary immortal cell line owned and controlled by [https://NantKwest.com NantKwest, Inc]., is a continuously growing cell line that has features and characteristics of natural killer (NK) cells that every person has circulating in the blood.  Blood NK cells and NK-92®️ cells recognize "invaders" such as viruses and fungus. Most importantly, NK-92®️ cells, like blood NK cells, can attack cancer cells as long as the tumor has not grown out of control. NK-92®️ cells were isolated and characterized by the laboratory of Dr. H. Klingemann - at that time at the British Columbia Cancer Agency in Vancouver, Canada.[1] The cells came from a patient who had a NK cell lymphoma, a rare lymphoma type. Although several other NK cell lines have been cloned, only NK-92®️ cells can be expanded to larger numbers and consistently kill tumor cells vigorously.[2] When NK-92®️ cells bind to a cancer or infected cell, they secrete perforinwhich punches holes in target cells followed by release of granzymes which induce apoptosis in the target cells. NK-92®️ cells also attack cancer cells through the Fas-Fas Ligand system and are capable of producing cytokines that by themselves can kill cancer cells (such as TNF-alpha) or stimulate and expand other immune cells such as interferon.[3] 

== NK-92®️ Cell Line Licensing and Rights ==

The cell line has been licensed to [https://nantKwest.com/ NantKwest], Inc. and is currently being developed in the clinic: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For intravenous therapy in hematological malignancies and solid tumors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For local intra-tumor injection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As effector cells for antibody-mediated killing via CD16 modified cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As effector cells for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific killing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
NK-92®️ cells is a registered trademark of [https://nantkwest.com/ NantKwest, Inc.] in the United States and is pending in Europe.

The cell line has been licensed for non-clinical applications to [http://brinkbiologics.com/ Brink Biologics Inc.] and has been licensing for veterinary applications to Coneksis, Inc.

NantKwest's only authorized distributor for all requestors is [https://brinkbiologics.com Brink Biologics Inc.], which makes NK-92®️ cells and certain genetically-modified variants available for a wide-range of laboratory assays and in vivo research, including ADCC assays that quantify the contribution of ADCC in the therapeutic effect of monoclonal antibodies (Brink Biologics’ Neukopanel) and for other non-clinical assay applications.
==NK-92&lt;sup&gt;®️&lt;/sup&gt; Cells in Clinical Trials==
Three phase I clinical trials, led by experts in adoptive immunotherapy of cancer, have so far yielded excellent results.  Hans Klingemann, MD, PhD and Sally Arai, MD completed the US trial at [[Rush University Medical Center]] ([[Chicago]]) in renal cell and melanoma patients,&lt;ref&gt;Arai S, Meagher R, Swearingen M, et al. Infusion of the allogeneic cell line NK-92®️ in patients with advanced [[renal cell]] cancer or [[melanoma]]: a phase I trial. Cytotherapy 2008;10:625-32&lt;/ref&gt; and Torsten Tonn, MD and Oliver Ottmann, MD completed the European trial at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]] in patients with various solid and hematological malignancies.&lt;ref&gt;Tonn T, Becker S, Esser R, Schwabe D, Seifried E. Cellular immunotherapy of malignancies using the clonal natural killer cell line NK-92®️. J Hematother Stem Cell Res 2001;10:535-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Armand Keating, MD is completing the last cohort of patients in the Canadian trial at [[Princess Margaret Cancer Centre|Princess Margaret Hospital]] in [[Toronto]] in [[lymphoma]] patients after autologous bone marrow transplants. In all three programs, NK-92®️ cells were administered as a simple intravenous infusion, dosed two or three times per treatment course and given in the outpatient setting.

Most importantly, there were no grade ≥ 2 side-effects during or after the short infusion of NK-92®️ cells. The maximum dose given in the Frankfurt trial was 10e10 cells/me2 x 2 infusions, each 48 hours apart. The Chicago study infused NK-92®️ cells at a maximum of 5 x 10e cells/me2 x 3 infusions, each 48 hours apart. This was not the MTD but rather the number of cells that could be expanded in culture bags over a three-week culture period. Alternative cell expansion technologies (bioreactors) will make it possible to further expand the numbers of NK-92®️ cells on a smaller 'footprint'.   Anecdotal reports of antitumor activity in the two completed phase I studies have been observed in 6/11 patients with renal cancer, 3/4 patients with lung cancer, and 1/1 patient with melanoma, all with very advanced disease. In addition to disease stabilization and regression of metastases in lung and [[lymph node]]s, the severe pain associated with tumor metastases in several patients, which had been refractory to standard chemotherapy, was remarkably lessened.  The ongoing trial in Toronto treats patients with lymphoma who have relapsed after an autologous stem cell transplant. Preliminary results suggest a significant benefit in several patients.

== Genetic Engineering of NK-92&lt;sup&gt;®️&lt;/sup&gt; Cells ==
NK-92®️ cells  can be genetically engineered to recognize and kill human cancer cells. 
Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) engineered [[T-lymphocyte]]s are currently the buzz in Immuno-Oncology, having shown that infusion of those engineered cells can achieve remissions in some patients with [[acute leukemia|acute]] and [[chronic leukemia]].&lt;ref name="pmid21830940"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Porter DL, Levine BL, Kalos M, Bagg A, June CH |title=Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells in chronic lymphoid leukemia |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=365 |issue=8 |pages=725–33 | date=August  2011 |pmid=21830940 |pmc=3387277 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1103849 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, NK cells (either from peripheral blood or cord blood) have not generated sufficient interest as CAR{{nbhyph}}engineered cytotoxic effector cells, largely for two reasons: the extent of NK cell expansion can be  dependent on the donor; secondly, transfection efficiency, even with lentiviral or retroviral vectors is only moderately efficient. NK-92®️ cells on the other hand, have predictable expansion kinetics and can be grown in bioreactors to billions of cells within a couple of weeks. They can easily be transfected either with viral supernatant or physical methods. Even [[mRNA]] can be shuttled into the cells with high efficiency. Since no integration of mRNA into the genome occurs, this transfection is less risky and  the regulatory burden is equally reduced.

NK-92®️ cells have also been transfected with a high affinity Fc Receptor (NK-92Fc) which is the main receptor for monoclonal antibodies to execute antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicty (ADCC) - examples: rituximab, ofatumumab. Based on this variant, an assay has been developed to quantify the ADCC of monoclonal antibodies (Neukopanel),&lt;ref name="pmid19562616"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weitzman J, Betancur M, Boissel L, Rabinowitz AP, Klein A, Klingemann H |title=Variable contribution of monoclonal antibodies to ADCC in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia |journal=Leuk.

The '''Napp Research Centre''' is a large medical research institute in the north of [[Cambridge]], and innovative-looking and award-winning architecture; it is a Cambridge [[landmark]].

==History==
Cambridge Science Park was built in the early 1970s and is part of the Napp Pharmaceutical Group, a pharmaceutical firm that manufactures analgesic, oncology and respiratory products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://napp.co.uk/products/patients Napp: Products]&lt;/ref&gt;

The grandiose innovative-looking building was designed in 1979, and was built in 1981. Staff moved in&lt;!--not a mistake--&gt; in 1983. Three more buildings were added in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aukettswanke.com/projects/NAPP 2007 building]&lt;/ref&gt; Stage D, E and F1 were added in 2012, designed by CPN Architects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cpna-uk.com/projects/ 2012 buildings]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] visited the building on 6 February 1985.&lt;ref&gt;''Times'', 7 February 1985, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]] visited the building on 19 October 1985.&lt;ref&gt;''Times'', 21 October 1985, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 July 1988, the site was visited by the [[List of Presidents of Turkey|seventh President of Turkey]], [[Kenan Evren]].&lt;ref&gt;''Times'', 15 July 1988, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of kings of Jordan|King of Jordan]], [[Abdullah II of Jordan]], visited the site with [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]] on 7 November 2001&lt;ref&gt;''Times'', 8 November 2001, page 22&lt;/ref&gt; ; the visit also included [[Zeus Technology]].

The site works with [[Cambridge Academy for Science and Technology]], a [[University technical college|UTC]].

==Structure==
[[File:Cambridge Science Park Napp.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance in April 2011]]

'''Outside broadcasting''' ('''OB''') is the [[electronic field production]] (EFP) of [[television]] or [[radio]] programmes (typically to cover [[television news]] and [[sports television]] events) from a mobile [[remote broadcast]] [[television studio]].  [[Professional video camera]] and [[microphone]] signals come into the [[production truck]] for processing, recording and possibly transmission.  The mobile [[production control room]] (PCR) is known as a "[[production truck]]", "scanner" (a BBC term), "mobile unit", "remote truck", "live truck", "OB van", "OB Truck" or "live eye".  In the [[United States]] an "OB van" is smaller in size than a production truck and generally requires two or three people in the field to manage.

== History ==
[[Image:DuMont Telecruiser - Early TV production truck.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Dumont Telecruiser, one of the earliest television [[production truck]]s which allowed remote TV broadcasts, built in 1949 by the [[Dumont Television Network]].  The microwave [[parabolic antenna|dish antenna]] on the roof beamed the live feed back to a dish at the studio.]]

The BBC's first Outside Broadcast truck MCR 1, short for mobile control room, was built by the joint Marconi-EMI company and delivered to the BBC just in time to televise the Coronation Procession of King George VI in May 1937. MCR 2 was identical to MCR 1 and was delivered in the summer of 1938. The MCRs could handle three cameras. Initially they were standard Emitrons, but were later supplemented by Super Emitrons, which performed much better than the standard ones in low light. The MCRs were built on the chassis of an AEC Regal single decker bus.

After the Second World War, the joint company Marconi-EMI ended. The BBC ordered two 3-camera MCRs from EMI. The cameras were equipped with CPS tubes, had electronic viewfinders and a 3 lens turret. MCR 4 was delivered in time to be used on the 1948 Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvobhistory.co.uk/bbc-mcrs---b--w.html|title=TV OUTSIDE BROADCAST HISTORY|last=|first=|date=|website=TV Outside Broadcast History|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After developing colour television in the mid 1960s, the BBC began to develop a fleet of colour OB units, known as CMCRs. These trucks were known as Type 2 scanners and were, at the time, completely state of the art. Type 2 scanners first came equipped with Pye PC80 cameras but these were soon superseded by EMI's 2001 colour cameras. These trucks would remain in service through the 1970s and into the mid 1980s. Throughout this time, they would see use on some of the BBC's most prestigious programmes, including Royal Events, Dr Who, Wimbledon Tennis, and Question Time.

Although made from converted HGVs, inside these trucks were incredibly cramped as a result of housing an entire mobile television studio. These were normally made up of three sections:

* A section to house the camera control units, or CCUs, and camera monitoring equipment. Being so large and complex, these cameras required a team of skilled engineers to keep them functioning. During a production, the camera operator would control the pan and the focus but it was the engineer who controlled the exposure and the colour balance.
* A section for the production crew, led by the director, who would orchestrate the over all production.
* A section for the sound crew which housed their mixing desk and other sound equipment. From here the sound crew controlled not only the sound of the programme but all the production communications which allowed the whole crew to communicate to one another. Without which the production would undoubtedly grind to a halt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=John|first=Ellis,|last2=Nick|first2=Hall,|date=2017-11-09|title=ADAPT|url=https://doi.org/10.17637/rh.c.3925603.v1|journal=figshare|language=en-US|doi=10.17637/rh.c.3925603.v1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern applications ==
In the past many outside broadcasting applications have relied on using [[satellite]] uplinks in order to broadcast live audio and video back to the studio. While this has its advantages such as the ability to set up virtually anywhere covered by the respective geostationary satellite, satellite uplinking is relatively expensive and the round trip [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] is in the range of 240 to 280 milliseconds.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.satsig.net/latency.htm&lt;/ref&gt; As more venues install Fibre, this is increasingly used. For news gathering, contribution over public internet is also now used. Modern applications such as hardware and software IP codecs have allowed the use of public 3G/4G networks to broadcast video and audio. The latency of 3G is around 100–500 ms, while 4G is less than 100 ms.&lt;ref&gt;http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000545/ch07.html#_brief_history_of_the_g_8217_s&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interior ==

A typical modern OB van is usually divided into five parts.

* Parts of the [[television crew]] are located in the first and largest part, the [[video production]] area.  The [[television director]], [[technical director]] (vision mixer), assistant director, [[character generator]] (CG or graphics) operator and [[television producer]]s usually sit in front of a wall of [[video monitor]]s.  The technical director sits in front of the [[video switcher]]. The video monitors show all the video feeds from various sources, including [[computer graphics]], professional video cameras, [[video tape recorder]] (VTR), [[video server]]s and slow-motion replay machines. The wall of monitors also contains a preview monitor showing what could be the next source on air (does not have to be depending on how the [[video switcher]] is set up) and a program monitor that shows the feed currently going to air or being recorded.  The [[keying (graphics)|keyed]] ''dirty feed'' (with [[digital on-screen graphic]]) is what is actually transmitted back to the central studio that is controlling the outside broadcast. A [[clean feed (TV)|clean feed]] (without the graphics) could be sent to other trucks for use in their production. The video switcher is usually operated by one person called the [[technical director#Television|technical director]] (TD) and is responsible for switching the video sources to air as directed. Behind the directors there is usually a desk with monitors for the editors to operate. It is essential that the directors and editors are in communication with each other during events, so that replays and slow-motion shots can be selected and aired. The "production room" in most sporting events has a graphics operator and sometimes a font coordinator who are in charge of the graphics, statistics, and the showing of the names of commentators or the players to be shown on air. Most sports also have a "box operator" (or "bug box operator") who controls the graphic seen either on the bottom or top of the screen that shows the score as seen at home. These operators can also show on-air stats, control the clock, and many times are also in charge of showing sponsors during play.
* The second part of a van is where the [[audio engineer]] has an [[audio mixer]] (being fed with all the various audio feeds: [[reporter]]s, commentary, on-field microphones, etc.). The audio engineer can control which channels are added to the output and follows instructions from the director. They relay the information from producers and directors to their [[A2 (remote television production)|A2]]'s who typically set up the audio cables and equipment throughout the arenas and the booth where the commentators sit.  The audio engineer normally also has a dirty feed monitor to help with the [[synchronization]] of sound and video.
* The third part of the truck is the VTR area. The tape area has a collection of machines including [[video server]]s and may also house additional power supplies or computer equipment. The "tape room" has [[Multicam (LSM)|EVS (or LSM) operators]] who have one or more cameras that go into their [[XT3 (EVS)|machines]] and can be played back for replays when an exciting or important play occurs during the game. EVS operators also play replay rollouts that lead into commercial breaks or show the highlights of the event at the end of play. These operators also can play back in slow motion or pause to show a key part of the action.
* The fourth part is the video control area where the [[professional video camera]]s are controlled using [[camera control unit]]s (CCU) by one or two [[operator (profession)|operators]], to make sure that the [[diaphragm (optics)|iris]] is at the correct exposure and that all the cameras look the same. These operators can shade, balance, and focus the cameras from this position inside the truck. This area is controlled by an operator called a V1 and depending on the size of the show and/or the broadcast company may have a V2.
* The fifth part is transmission, where the signal is monitored by and engineered for quality control purposes and is transmitted or sent to other trucks. The transmission is monitored by the truck engineers to ensure the people at home have a good picture and a high quality signal output.

==Terminology==
Many terms have been used to describe atypical sexual interests, and there remains debate regarding technical accuracy and perceptions of stigma. [[Sexologist]] [[John Money]] popularized the term ''paraphilia'' as a non-[[pejorative]] designation for [[Kink (sexual)|unusual sexual interests]].&lt;ref name="wiederman2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weiderman |first=M. |year=2003 |title=Paraphilia and Fetishism |journal=The Family Journal |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=315–321 |doi=10.1177/1066480703252663 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bullough1995"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bullough | first = VL | year = 1995 | url = http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/LIBRO.HTM | title = Science in the Bedroom: A History of Sex Research | page = 281 | publisher = [[Basic Books]] | isbn = 978-0-465-07259-0 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061022080700/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/LIBRO.HTM | archivedate = 22 October 2006 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moser2001"&gt;{{cite book | last = Moser | first = C | year = 2001 | chapter = Critiques of conventional models of sex therapy | editor = Kleinplatz PJ | title = New directions in sex therapy: innovations and alternatives | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis|Psychology Press]] | isbn =  978-0-87630-967-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mccammon2004"&gt;{{cite book | last = McCammon | first = S |author2=Knox D |author3=Schacht C | year = 2004 | title = Choices in sexuality | page = 476 | publisher = Atomic Dog Publishing | isbn =  978-1-59260-050-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Money described paraphilia as "a sexuoerotic embellishment of, or alternative to the official, ideological norm."&lt;ref name="money1990"&gt;{{cite book | last = Money | first = J | authorlink = John Money | year = 1990 | title = Gay, Straight, and In-Between: The Sexology of Erotic Orientation | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-19-506331-8 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=nCvBoIr4eTYC&amp;pg=PA139#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 139]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrist [[Glen Gabbard]] writes that despite efforts by Stekel and Money, "the term ''paraphilia'' remains pejorative in most circumstances."&lt;ref name="gabbard2007"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gabbard | first = GO | year = 2007| title = Gabbard's Treatments of Psychiatric Disorders| publisher = American Psychiatric Press | isbn = 978-1-58562-216-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coinage of the term ''paraphilia'' (''paraphilie'') has been credited to [[Friedrich Salomon Krauss]] in 1903, and it entered the English language in 1913, in reference to Krauss by urologist [[William J. Robinson]].&lt;ref name="janssen"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janssen|first=D.F.|year=2014|title=How to "Ascertain" Paraphilia?

In the late 19th century, psychologists and psychiatrists started to categorize various paraphilias as they wanted a more descriptive system than the legal and religious constructs of [[sodomy]]&lt;ref name="dailey1989 "&gt;Dailey, Dennis M.

===Homosexuality and non-heterosexuality===
[[Homosexuality]], now widely considered a normal variant of human sexuality, was at one time discussed as a sexual deviation.&lt;ref name="hutchinson"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hutchinson | first = GE | year = 1959 | title = A speculative consideration of certain possible forms of sexual selection in man | journal = [[American Naturalist]] | volume = 93 | issue = 869 | pages = 81–91 | doi = 10.1086/282059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]] and subsequent [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] thinkers considered homosexuality and paraphilias to result from [[Psychosexual development|psychosexual]] non-normative relations to the [[Oedipal complex]].&lt;ref name="Lacan, Jacques. Le Séminaire. Livre IV. La relation d'objet, 19566-57. Ed. Jacques-Alain Miller.

By the mid-20th century, mental health practitioners began formalizing "deviant sexuality" classifications into categories. Originally coded as 000-x63, homosexuality was the top of the classification list (Code 302.0) until the [[American Psychiatric Association]] removed homosexuality from the DSM in 1974. [[Martin Kafka]] writes, "Sexual disorders once considered paraphilias (e.g., homosexuality) are now regarded as variants of normal sexuality."&lt;ref name="kafka1996"/&gt;

A 2012 literature study by clinical psychologist [[James Cantor]], when comparing homosexuality with paraphilias, found that both share "the features of onset and course (both homosexuality and paraphilia being life-long), but they appear to differ on sex ratio, [[fraternal birth order effect|fraternal birth order]], [[handedness]], [[IQ]] and cognitive profile, and neuroanatomy". The research then concluded that the data seemed to suggest paraphilias and homosexuality as two distinct categories, but regarded the conclusion as "quite tentative" given the current limited understanding of paraphilias.&lt;ref name = Cantor2012/&gt;

==Causes==
The causes of paraphilic sexual preferences in people are unclear, although a growing body of research points to a possible prenatal neurodevelopmental correlation. A 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 heterosexual men by using the Wilson Sex Fantasy Questionnaire exam, determined that males with a pronounced degree of fetish interest had a greater number of older brothers, a high 2D:4D [[digit ratio]] (which would indicate excessive prenatal estrogen exposure), and an elevated probability of being [[Left-handedness|left-handed]], suggesting that disturbed hemispheric [[Lateralization of brain function|brain lateralization]] may play a role in deviant attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rahman Q, Symeonides DJ | title = Neurodevelopmental Correlates of Paraphilic Sexual Interests in Men | journal = [[Archives of Sexual Behavior]] | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 166–172 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 18074220 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-007-9255-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Behaviorism|Behavioral]] explanations propose that paraphilias are [[Classical conditioning|conditioned]] early in life, during an experience that pairs the paraphilic stimulus with intense sexual arousal.&lt;ref name="Nolen-Hoeksema2013"&gt;{{cite book | author = Nolen-Hoeksema, Susan | year = 2013 | url = http://connect.customer.mheducation.com/products/connect-for-nolen-hoeksema-abnormal-psychology-6e/ | title = Abnormal Psychology | edition = 6th | location = Boston | publisher = McGraw-Hill | isbn = 978-0078035388 | page = 385}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Nolen-Hoeksema]] suggests that, once established, [[masturbatory]] fantasies about the stimulus reinforce and broaden the paraphilic arousal.&lt;ref name="Nolen-Hoeksema2013" /&gt;

==Diagnosis==
There is scientific and political controversy regarding the continued inclusion of sex-related diagnoses such as the paraphilias in the DSM, due to the stigma of being classified as a mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Kleinplatz | first = PJ |author2=Moser C | year = 2005 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=gcZDghztlpMC&amp;pg=PA135#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Politics versus science: An addendum and response to Drs.

Some groups, seeking greater understanding and acceptance of [[sexual diversity]], have lobbied for changes to the legal and medical status of unusual sexual interests and practices. Charles Allen Moser, a physician and advocate for sexual minorities, has argued that the diagnoses should be eliminated from diagnostic manuals.&lt;ref name="moser2005"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Moser C, Kleinplatz PJ | year = 2005 | title = DSM-IV-TR and the Paraphilias: An argument for removal | url = | journal = Journal of Psychology and Human Sexuality | volume = 17 | issue = 3/4| pages = 91–109 | doi=10.1300/j056v17n03_05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Typical versus atypical interests===
[[Albert Eulenburg]] (1914) noted a commonality across the paraphilias, using the terminology of his time, "All the forms of sexual perversion...have one thing in common: their roots reach down into the matrix of natural and normal sex life; there they are somehow closely connected with the feelings and expressions of our physiological erotism. They are...hyperbolic intensifications, distortions, monstrous fruits of certain partial and secondary expressions of this erotism which is considered 'normal' or at least within the limits of healthy sex feeling."&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Eulenburg|Eulenburg]] (1914). ''Ueber sexualle Perversionen. Ztschr. f. Sexualwissenschaft,'' Vol. I, No. 8. translated in [[Wilhelm Stekel|Stekel, Wilhelm]]. (1940). ''Sexual aberrations: The phenomena of fetishism in relation to sex.'' New York: Liveright, p. 4. {{OCLC|795528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clinical literature contains reports of many paraphilias, only some of which receive their own entries in the diagnostic taxonomies of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] or the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psyweb.com/Mdisord/DSM_IV/jsp/Axis_I.jsp |title="Axis I.

For example, as of May 2000, per DSM-IV-TR, "Because some cases of Sexual Sadism may not involve harm to a victim (e.g., inflicting humiliation on a consenting partner), the wording for sexual sadism involves a hybrid of the DSM-III-R and DSM-IV wording (i.e., "the person has acted on these urges with a non-consenting person, or the urges, sexual fantasies, or behaviors cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsmivtr.org/2-3changes.cfm Summary of Practice-Relevant Changes to the DSM-IV-TR] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511220758/http://www.dsmivtr.org/2-3changes.cfm |date=11 May 2008 }} from [http://www.dsmivtr.org/ Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517004926/http://www.dsmivtr.org/ |date=17 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSM-IV-TR also acknowledges that the diagnosis and classification of paraphilias across cultures or religions "is complicated by the fact that what is considered deviant in one cultural setting may be more acceptable in another setting”.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). ''Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders'' (4th ed., text rev.). Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that [[cultural relativism]] is important to consider when discussing paraphilias, because there is wide variance concerning what is sexually acceptable across cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dinesh Bhugra|author2=Dmitri Popelyuk|author3=Isabel McMullen|last-author-amp=yes|title=Paraphilias Across Cultures: Contexts and Controversies|journal=Journal of Sex Research|date=2010|volume=2|issue=47|pages=242–256|doi=10.1080/00224491003699833|pmid=20358463|url=http://0-search.ebscohost.com.mercury.concordia.ca/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=48944219&amp;site=ehost-live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[consent|Consensual]] adult activities and [[adult entertainment]] involving [[sexual roleplay]], novel, superficial, or trivial aspects of [[sexual fetishism]], or incorporating the use of [[sex toys]] are not necessarily paraphilic.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Paraphilial [[psychopathology]] is not the same as [[psychology|psychologically]] normative adult [[human sexual behavior]]s, [[sexual fantasy]], and sex play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Defining "Normophilic" and "Paraphilic" Sexual Fantasies in a Population-Based Sample: On the Importance of Considering Subgroups|journal = Sexual Medicine|date = 1 November 2015|issn = 2050-1161|pages = 321–330|doi = 10.1002/sm2.96|pmid = 26797067|pmc = 4721032|first = Christian C.|last = Joyal|volume=3|issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intensity and specificity===
Clinicians distinguish between optional, preferred and exclusive paraphilias,&lt;ref name=DSM/&gt; though the terminology is not completely standardized. An "optional" paraphilia is an alternative route to sexual arousal. In preferred paraphilias, a person prefers the paraphilia to conventional sexual activities, but also engages in conventional sexual activities.

The literature includes single-case studies of exceedingly rare and idiosyncratic paraphilias. These include an adolescent male who had a strong fetishistic interest in the exhaust pipes of cars, a young man with a similar interest in a specific type of car, and a man who had a paraphilic interest in sneezing (both his own and the sneezing of others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Psychiatry|volume=6|issue=3|date=March 2007|pages=130&amp;ndash;134|title=Sexual disorder and psychosexual therapy|author=Padmal de Silva|doi=10.1016/j.mppsy.2006.12.009|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B82Y7-4N0GJN5-6&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=03%2F31%2F2007&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=0e747196d9865801e85db7b1c2942c5b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=King, M.B.|title=Sneezing as a fetish object|journal=[[Sexual and Marital Therapy]]|volume=5|year=1990|pages=69&amp;ndash;72|doi=10.1080/02674659008407999|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DSM-I and DSM-II ===
In American psychiatry, prior to the publication of the DSM-I, paraphilias were classified as cases of "psychopathic personality with pathologic sexuality". The DSM-I (1952) included [[sexual deviation]] as a [[personality disorder]] of [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] subtype. The only diagnostic guidance was that sexual deviation should have been "reserved for deviant sexuality which [was] not symptomatic of more extensive syndromes, such as schizophrenic or obsessional reactions". The specifics of the disorder were to be provided by the clinician as a "supplementary term" to the sexual deviation diagnosis; there were no restrictions in the DSM-I on what this supplementary term could be.&lt;ref&gt;Laws and, O'Donohue (2008) pp. 384-385 citing DSM-I pp. 7, 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher [[Anil Aggrawal]] writes that the now-obsolete DSM-I listed examples of supplementary terms for pathological behavior to include "homosexuality, transvestism, pedophilia, fetishism, and sexual sadism, including rape, sexual assault, mutilation."&lt;ref name="aggrawal2008"&gt;{{cite book | last = Aggrawal | first = A | year = 2008 | title = Forensic and medico-legal aspects of sexual crimes and unusual sexual practices | page = 47 | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | isbn = 978-1-4200-4308-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSM-II (1968) continued to use the term ''sexual deviations'', but no longer ascribed them under personality disorders, but rather alongside them in a broad category titled "personality disorders and certain other nonpsychotic mental disorders". The types of sexual deviations listed in the DSM-II were: sexual orientation disturbance (homosexuality), fetishism, pedophilia, transvestitism (sic), exhibitionism, voyeurism, sadism, masochism, and "other sexual deviation". No definition or examples were provided for "other sexual deviation", but the general category of sexual deviation was meant to describe the sexual preference of individuals that was "directed primarily toward objects other than people of opposite sex, toward sexual acts not usually associated with [[coitus]], or toward coitus performed under bizarre circumstances, as in necrophilia, pedophilia, sexual sadism, and fetishism."&lt;ref&gt;Laws and, O'Donohue (2008) p. 385 citing DSM-II p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Except for the removal of homosexuality from the DSM-III onwards, this definition provided a general standard that has guided specific definitions of paraphilias in subsequent DSM editions, up to DSM-IV-TR.&lt;ref name="Laws and, O'Donohue 2008 p. 386"&gt;Laws and O'Donohue (2008) p. 386&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DSM-III through DSM-IV ===
The term ''paraphilia'' was introduced in the DSM-III (1980) as a subset of the new category of "psychosexual disorders."

The DSM-III-R (1987) renamed the broad category to [[sexual disorder]]s, renamed atypical paraphilia to paraphilia NOS (not otherwise specified), renamed transvestism as [[transvestic fetishism]], added [[frotteurism]], and moved [[zoophilia]] to the NOS category. It also provided seven nonexhaustive examples of NOS paraphilias, which besides zoophilia included [[telephone scatologia]], necrophilia, [[partialism]], [[coprophilia]], [[klismaphilia]], and [[urophilia]].&lt;ref&gt;Laws and, O'Donohue (2008) p. 385&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSM-IV (1994) retained the sexual disorders classification for paraphilias, but added an even broader category, "sexual and [[gender identity disorder]]s," which includes them. The DSM-IV retained the same types of paraphilias listed in DSM-III-R, including the NOS examples, but introduced some changes to the definitions of some specific types.&lt;ref name="Laws and, O'Donohue 2008 p. 386"/&gt;

===DSM-IV-TR===
The DSM-IV-TR describes paraphilias as "recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges or behaviors generally involving nonhuman objects,  the suffering or humiliation of oneself or one's partner, or children or other nonconsenting persons that occur over a period of six months" (criterion A), which "cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning" (criterion B). DSM-IV-TR names eight specific paraphilic disorders ([[exhibitionism]], [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]], [[frotteurism]], [[pedophilia]], [[Sexual masochism disorder|sexual masochism]], [[Sexual sadism disorder|sexual sadism]], [[voyeurism]], and [[transvestic fetishism]], plus a residual category, [[Paraphilia not otherwise specified|paraphilia—not otherwise specified]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/55266|title=Paraphilias: Clinical and Forensic Considerations|website=psychiatrictimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criterion B differs for exhibitionism, frotteurism, and pedophilia to include acting on these urges, and for sadism, acting on these urges with a nonconsenting person.&lt;ref name = DSM&gt;American Psychiatric Association (2000). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed., text revision). pp. 569-570, 572, 574, Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexual arousal]] in association with objects that were designed for sexual purposes is not diagnosable.&lt;ref name = DSM/&gt;

Some paraphilias may interfere with the capacity for sexual activity with consenting adult partners.&lt;ref name = DSM/&gt;

In the current version of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR), a paraphilia is not diagnosable as a [[psychiatric disorder]] unless it causes distress to the individual or harm to others.&lt;ref name = "DSMTR"/&gt;

=== DSM-5 ===
The [[DSM-5]] adds a distinction between ''paraphilias'' and ''paraphilic disorders'', stating that paraphilias do not require or justify psychiatric treatment in themselves, and defining ''paraphilic disorder'' as "a paraphilia that is currently causing distress or impairment to the individual or a paraphilia whose satisfaction has entailed personal harm, or risk of harm, to others".&lt;ref name="DSM-5, intro" /&gt;

The DSM-5 Paraphilias Subworkgroup reached a "consensus that paraphilias are not ''ipso facto'' psychiatric disorders", and proposed "that the DSM-V make a distinction between ''paraphilias'' and paraphilic ''disorders''. [...] One would ''ascertain'' a paraphilia (according to the nature of the urges, fantasies, or behaviors) but ''diagnose'' a paraphilic disorder (on the basis of distress and impairment). In this conception, having a paraphilia would be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for having a paraphilic disorder." The 'Rationale' page of any paraphilia in the electronic DSM-5 draft continues: "This approach leaves intact the distinction between normative and non-normative sexual behavior, which could be important to researchers, but without automatically labeling non-normative sexual behavior as psychopathological. It also eliminates certain logical absurdities in the DSM-IV-TR. In that version, for example, a man cannot be classified as a transvestite—however much he cross-dresses and however sexually exciting that is to him—unless he is unhappy about this activity or impaired by it. This change in viewpoint would be reflected in the diagnostic criteria sets by the addition of the word "Disorder" to all the paraphilias. Thus, Sexual Sadism would become [[Sexual sadism disorder|Sexual Sadism Disorder]]; Sexual Masochism would become [[Sexual masochism disorder|Sexual Masochism Disorder]], and so on."&lt;ref name=dsm5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid%3D186 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215165810/http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=186 |archivedate=15 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bioethics]] professor Alice Dreger interpreted these changes as "a subtle way of saying sexual kinks are basically okay – so okay, the sub-work group doesn’t actually bother to define paraphilia. But a paraphilic disorder is defined: that’s when an atypical sexual interest causes distress or impairment to the individual or harm to others." Interviewed by Dreger, [[Ray Blanchard]], the Chair of the Paraphilias Sub-Work Group, explained: "We tried to go as far as we could in depathologizing mild and harmless paraphilias, while recognizing that severe paraphilias that distress or impair people or cause them to do harm to others are validly regarded as disorders."&lt;ref&gt;Alice Dreger (19 Feb 2010) ''[http://www.thehastingscenter.org/of-kinks-crimes-and-kinds-the-paraphilias-proposal-for-the-dsm-5 Of Kinks, Crimes, and Kinds: The Paraphilias Proposal for the DSM-5]'', [[Hastings Center]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Allen Moser pointed out that this change is not really substantive as DSM-IV already acknowledged a difference between paraphilias and non-pathological but unusual sexual interests, a distinction that is virtually identical to what is being proposed for DSM-5, and it is a distinction that, in practice, has often been ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moser C | year = 2010 | title = Problems with Ascertainment | url = | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 39 | issue = 6| pages = 1225–1227 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-010-9661-9 | pmid = 20652734 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linguist]] [[Andrew Clinton Hinderliter]] argued that "Including some sexual interests—but not others—in the DSM creates a fundamental asymmetry and communicates a negative value judgment against the sexual interests included," and leaves the paraphilias in a situation similar to ego-dystonic homosexuality, which was removed from the DSM because it was realized not to be a mental disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Andrew Clinton|last=Hinderliter|authorlink=Andrew Clinton Hinderliter| year=2010|title=Defining paraphilia: excluding exclusion|journal=Open Access Journal of Forensic Psychology|volume=2|pages=241–271|url=http://web.me.com/gregdeclue/Site/Volume_2__2010_files/Hinderliter%202010.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSM-5 acknowledges that many dozens of paraphilias exist, but only has specific listings for eight that are forensically important and relatively common. These are voyeuristic disorder, exhibitionistic disorder, frotteuristic disorder, sexual masochism disorder, sexual sadism disorder, pedophilic disorder, fetishistic disorder, and transvestic disorder.&lt;ref name="DSM-5, intro" /&gt; Other paraphilias can be diagnosed under the [[Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder]] or Unspecified Paraphilic Disorder listings, if accompanied by distress or impairment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders | edition = Fifth | chapter = Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder; Unspecified Paraphilic Disorder | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | page = 705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Most clinicians and researchers believe that paraphilic sexual interests cannot be altered,&lt;ref name="SetoAhmed2014"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Seto MC, Ahmed AG |title=Treatment and management of child pornography use |journal=Psychiatric Clinics of North America |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=207–214 |year=2014 |pmid=24877707 |doi=10.1016/j.psc.2014.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; although evidence is needed to support this.&lt;ref name="SetoAhmed2014" /&gt; Instead, the goal of therapy is normally to reduce the person's discomfort with their paraphilia and limit any criminal behavior.&lt;ref name="SetoAhmed2014" /&gt; Both [[psychotherapeutic]] and pharmacological methods are available to these ends.&lt;ref name="SetoAhmed2014" /&gt;

[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]], at times, can help people with paraphilias develop strategies to avoid acting on their interests.&lt;ref name="SetoAhmed2014" /&gt; Patients are taught to identify and cope with factors that make acting on their interests more likely, such as stress.&lt;ref name="SetoAhmed2014" /&gt; It is currently the only form of psychotherapy for paraphilias supported by randomized double-blind trials, as opposed to case studies and consensus of expert opinion.&lt;ref name="thibaut2010" /&gt;&lt;!-- p. 646 --&gt;

===Medications===
Pharmacological treatments can help people control their sexual behaviors, but do not change the content of the paraphilia.&lt;ref name="thibaut2010" /&gt; They are typically combined with cognitive behavioral therapy for best effect.&lt;ref name="assumpcao2014"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Assumpção AA, Garcia FD, Garcia HD, Bradford JM, Thibaut F |title=Pharmacologic treatment of paraphilias |journal=Psychiatric Clinics of North America |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=173–181 |year=2014 |pmid=24877704 |doi=10.1016/j.psc.2014.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====SSRIs====
[[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs) are used, especially with exhibitionists, non-offending pedophiles, and compulsive masturbators. They are proposed to work by reducing sexual arousal, [[compulsivity]], and depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name="assumpcao2014" /&gt; They have been well received and are considered an important pharmacological treatment of paraphilia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kraus|first=C.|last2=Strohm|first2=K.|last3=Hill|first3=A.|last4=Habermann|first4=N.|last5=Berner|first5=W.|last6=Briken|first6=P.|date=2007-6|title=[Selective serotonine reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) in the treatment of paraphilia]|journal=Fortschritte der Neurologie-Psychiatrie|volume=75|issue=6|pages=351–356|doi=10.1055/s-2006-944261|issn=0720-4299|pmid=17031776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Antiandrogens====
[[Antiandrogen]]s are used in more severe cases.&lt;ref name="assumpcao2014" /&gt; Similar to physical [[castration]], they work by reducing [[androgen]] levels, and have thus been described as [[chemical castration]].&lt;ref name="assumpcao2014" /&gt; The antiandrogen [[cyproterone acetate]] has been shown to substantially reduce sexual fantasies and offending behaviors.&lt;ref name="assumpcao2014" /&gt; [[Medroxyprogesterone acetate]] and [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist]]s (such as [[leuprorelin]]) have also been used to lower sex drive.&lt;ref name="assumpcao2014" /&gt; Due to the side effects, the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry recommends that hormonal treatments only be used when there is a serious risk of sexual violence, or when other methods have failed.&lt;!-- p. 647 --&gt;&lt;ref name="thibaut2010"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Thibaut F, De La Barra F, Gordon H, Cosyns P, Bradford JM |title=The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) guidelines for the biological treatment of paraphilias |journal=The World Journal of Biological Psychiatry|volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=604–655 |year=2010 |pmid=20459370 |doi=10.3109/15622971003671628}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surgical [[castration]] has largely been abandoned because these pharmacological alternatives are similarly effective and less invasive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Camilleri JA, Quinsey VL |date= 2008 | title = Sexual Deviance: Theory, Assessment, and Treatment | edition = 2nd | publisher = The Guilford Press | pages = 199–200 | chapter = Pedophilia: Assessment and Treatment | veditors = Laws DR, O'Donohue WT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Research has shown that paraphilias are rarely observed in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=American Psychiatric Association|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: Fourth Edition|date=1994|page=594|edition=IV|id= {{ASIN|0890420629|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DSM-V"&gt;{{Citation | last = American Psychiatric Association| first = | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: Fifth Edition | journal = | date = 2013| pages = 685–706 | edition = 5th| id =  {{ASIN|0890425558|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been some studies on females with paraphilias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eva W. C. Chow|author2=Alberto L. Choy|last-author-amp=yes|title=Clinical Characteristics and Treatment Response to SSRI in a Female Pedophile|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=April 2002|volume=31|issue=2|pages=211–215|accessdate=14 March 2015|doi=10.1023/A:1014795321404|url=http://0-download.springer.com.mercury.concordia.ca/static/pdf/886/art%253A10.1023%252FA%253A1014795321404.pdf?auth66=1425842757_14e2bfac5512359c2fbdb237bd2d809b&amp;ext=.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual masochism has been found to be the most commonly observed paraphilia in women, with approximately 1 in 20 cases of sexual masochism being female.&lt;ref name=DSM/&gt;&lt;ref name="DSM-V" /&gt;

Many acknowledge the scarcity of research on female paraphilias.&lt;ref name="Hunsley"&gt;{{Citation| first = John| last = Hunsley | title = A Guide to Assessments That Work | place = New York | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| series = | volume = | edition = | year = 2008| pages = 496–497 | doi = | isbn = 978-0-19-531064-1 | mr =  | zbl =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of paraphilia studies are conducted on people who have been convicted of [[Sex and the law|sex crimes]].&lt;ref name="Duncan"&gt;{{Citation | first = Karen A. | last = Duncan | title = Female Sexual Predators: Understanding Them to Protect Our Children and Youths | place = Santa Barbara | publisher = [[Praeger Publishing|Praeger]] | year = 2010| isbn = 978-0-313-36629-1 | zbl =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the number of male convicted sex offenders far exceeds the number of female convicted sex offenders, research on paraphilic behavior in women is consequently lacking.&lt;ref name="Duncan" /&gt; Some researchers argue that an underrepresentation exists concerning pedophilia in females.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lisa J.

He states that while a man's sexual arousal can be directly measured from his erection (see [[penile plethysmograph]]), a woman's sexual arousal cannot be measured as clearly (see [[vaginal photoplethysmograph]]), and therefore research concerning female sexuality is rarely as conclusive as research on men.&lt;ref name="Hunsley" /&gt;

==Legal issues==
In the United States, following a series of landmark cases in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], persons diagnosed with paraphilias, particularly pedophilia (''[[Kansas v. Hendricks]]'', 1997) and exhibitionism (''[[Kansas v.

'''Physiological condition''' or, more often "physiological conditions" is a term used in [[biology]], [[biochemistry]], and [[medicine]]. It refers to conditions of the external or [[milieu interieur|internal milieu]] that may occur in nature for that organism or cell system, in contrast to artificial [[laboratory]] conditions. A temperature range of 20-40 degrees Celsius, atmospheric pressure of 1, pH of 6-8, glucose concentration of 1-20 mM, atmospheric oxygen concentration, and earth gravity are examples of physiological conditions for most earth organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Casarett and Doulls Toxicology , Basic Science of Poisons|publisher=CTI Reviews|date=26 September 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAQg93xxZyoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pore pressure gradient''' is a dimensional [[Petrophysics|petrophysical]] term used by [[drilling engineer]]s and [[mud engineer]]s during the design of drilling programs for drilling (constructing) [[Oil well|oil]] and gas wells into the earth. It is the [[pressure gradient]] inside the pore space of the [[rock column]] from the surface of the ground down to the total depth (TD), as compared to the pressure gradient of seawater in deep water.

Whereas in "[[pure math]]," the gradient of a [[scalar function]] expressed by the math notation grad(''f'') may not have physical units associated with it; in drilling engineering the pore pressure gradient is usually expressed in API-type [[International Association of Drilling Contractors]] (IADC) physical units of measurement, namely "psi per foot." In the well-known formula

:''P'' = 0.052 * mud weight * true vertical depth

taught in almost all [[petroleum engineering]] courses worldwide, the mud weight (MW) is expressed in pounds per U.S. gallon, and the true vertical depth (TVD) is expressed in feet, and 0.052 is a commonly used conversion constant that can be derived by dimensional analysis:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ \frac{1\; psi}{ft} \times \frac{1\; ft}{12\; in}\times \frac{1\; lb/in^{2}}{1\; psi}\times \frac{231\; in^{3}}{1\; US\; Gal}=19.25000000\; lb/gal}&lt;/math&gt;

It would be more accurate to divide a value in lb/gal by 19.25 than to multiply that value by 0.052. The magnitude of the error caused by multiplying by 0.052 is approximately 0.1%.

Example: For a column of fresh water of 8.33 pounds per gallon (lb/U.S. gal) standing still hydrostatically in a 21,000 feet vertical cased wellbore from top to bottom (vertical hole), the pressure gradient would be
:grad(''P'') = pressure gradient = 8.33 / 19.25 = 0.43273 psi/ft

and the hydrostatic bottom hole pressure (BHP) is then
:BHP = TVD * grad(''P'') = 21,000 * 0.43273 = 9,087 psi

However, the formation fluid pressure (pore pressure) is usually much greater than a column of fresh water, and can be as much as 19 lb/U.S. gal (e.g., in Iran). For an onshore vertical wellbore with an exposed open hole interval at 21,000 feet with a pore pressure gradient of 19 lb/U.S. gal, the BHP would be
:BHP = pore pres grad * TVD = 21,000 * 19 / 19.25 = 20,727 psi

The calculation of a bottom hole pressure and the pressure induced by a static column of fluid are the most important and basic calculations in all well control courses taught worldwide for the prevention of oil and gas well blowouts.

== Simple Examples ==
Using the figures above, we can calculate the maximum pressure at various depths in an offshore oil well.

  Saltwater is '''0.444 psi/ft''' (2.5% higher than fresh water but this not general and depends on salt concentration in water)
  Pore pressure in the rock could be as high as '''1.0 psi/ft''' of depth (19.25 lb/gal)

A well with 5,000 feet of seawater and 15,000 feet of rock could have an overburden pressures at the bottom as high as '''17,220 psi'''  (5000 * 0.444 + 15000 * 1.0).  That pressure is reduced at the surface by the weight of oil and gas the riser pipe, but this is only a small percentage of the total.  It takes heavy mud (drilling fluid) inserted at the bottom to control the well when pressures are this high.

A '''rosette sampler''' is a device used for [[water]] [[Sample (material)|sampling]] in deep water (such as the [[Great Lakes]] or [[Ocean|oceans]]) in order to investigate about its [[water quality|quality]].

== Description ==
A rosette sampler is made of an assembly of 12 to 36 sampling bottles.&lt;ref name=whoi&gt;[https://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=8415&amp;tid=7342&amp;cid=11375 Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, "Rosette Sampler"]&lt;/ref&gt; Each bottle is a [[volume]] that range from a minimum value of 1.2 [[Litre|L]] to a maximum value of 30 L.&lt;ref name=whoi/&gt; All of them constitutes the rosette sampler and are clustered around a cylinder situated in the center of the assembly,&lt;ref name=whoi/&gt; where there is a sensing system called Sea-Bird or [[CTD (instrument)|CTD]], that stands for "Conductivity, Temperature and Depth", although other variables can be measured by modern CTDs (e.g. water [[turbidity]], dissolved [[oxygen]] [[concentration]], [[chlorophyll]] concentration and [[pH]]).&lt;ref name=cee&gt;[http://www.cee.mtu.edu/great_lakes/images2/spotlight_rosette_CDT.html Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering Department at Michigan Tech, "CTD and the Rosette samples on Lake Superior"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The apparatus is attached to a wire rope. A winch on board of the boat unroll the rope during descent and roll up it during the ascent (i.e. at the end of the samples collection). During operations in the ocean, a rosette sampler can approach the seabed at a distance from 1 to 5 m, depending on the particular sea conditions.&lt;ref name=jan/&gt;

The opening of each sampling bottle can be automatic (by reaching a certain depth) or manual (by operator, remotely).&lt;ref name=cee/&gt;

== Applications ==
Water sampling is used in general for [[chemical analysis]] and [[ecotoxicology|ecotoxicological]] assessment.&lt;ref name=jan&gt;[https://www.cefas.co.uk/premiam/publications/post-incident-monitoring-guidelines-subsea-oil-releases-and-dispersant-use/tg01-water-sampling/ Jan Brant, "Collection of water samples"]&lt;/ref&gt;

A rosette sampler is preferred to [[Winchester sampler]] for collection of water sampling at depths greater than 50 [[meter|m]].&lt;ref name=jan/&gt;

'''Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase''' ('''SA-β-gal''' or '''SABG''') is a hypothetical [[hydrolase]] [[enzyme]] that [[catalyst|catalyzes]] the [[hydrolysis]] of [[beta-galactoside|β-galactoside]]s into [[monosaccharide]]s only in [[Senescence#Cellular senescence|senescent cells]]. Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, along with [[p16|p16&lt;sup&gt;Ink4A&lt;/sup&gt;]], is regarded to be a [[biomarker]] of [[Senescence#Cellular senescence|cellular senescence]].&lt;ref name="pmid27391570 "&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Hall BM, Balan V, Gleiberman AS, Strom E, Krasnov P, Virtuoso LP, Rydkina E, Vujcic S, Balan K, Gitlin I, Leonova K, Polinsky A, Chernova OB, Gudkov AV | title=Aging of mice is associated with p16(Ink4a)- and β-galactosidase-positive macrophage accumulation that can be induced in young mice by senescent cells | journal= [[Aging (journal)|Aging]] | volume=8 | issue=7 | pages=1294–1315 | year=2016 | url=http://www.aging-us.com/article/XFECL8coa6th4i87b/text | doi= 10.18632/aging.100991 | pmc = 4993332 | pmid=27391570}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=|year=2017|title=p16(Ink4a) and senescence-associated β-galactosidase can be induced in macrophages as part of a reversible response to physiological stimuli|url=http://www.aging-us.com/article/101268/text|journal=Aging|location=Albany NY|volume=9|pages=1867-1884|doi=10.18632/aging.101268|via=|vauthors=Hall BM, Balan V, Gleiberman AS, Strom E, Krasnov P, Virtuoso LP, Rydkina E, Vujcic S, Balan K, Gitlin II, Leonovo KI, Consiglio CR, Gollnick SO, et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its existence was proposed in 1995 by Dimri et al.&lt;ref name="pmid7568133"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dimri GP, Lee X, Basile G, Acosta M, Scott G, Roskelley C, Medrano EE, Linskens M, Rubelj I, Pereira-Smith O | title = A biomarker that identifies senescent human cells in culture and in aging skin in vivo | journal = Proc.

They proposed a cytochemical assay based on production of a blue-dyed precipitate that results from the cleavage of the chromogenic substrate [[X-Gal]], which stains blue when cleaved by galactosidase. Since then, even more specific quantitative assays were developed for its detection at pH 6.0.&lt;ref name="pmid17920029"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bassaneze V, Miyakawa AA, Krieger JE | title = A quantitative chemiluminescent method for studying replicative and stress-induced premature senescence in cell cultures | journal = Anal.

'''Social science''' is a category of [[Discipline (academia)|academic disciplines]], concerned with [[society]] and the [[Social relation|relationships]] among [[individuals]] within a society. Social science as a whole has many branches, each of which is considered a social science. The social sciences include, but are not limited to: [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[communication studies]], [[economics]], [[history]], [[human geography]], [[jurisprudence]], [[linguistics]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], [[public health]], and [[sociology]]. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original "science of society", established in the 19th century. For a more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences see: [[Outline of social science]].

[[Positivism|Positivist]] social scientists use methods resembling those of the [[natural science]]s as tools for understanding society, and so define science in its stricter [[Modern science|modern sense]]. [[Antipositivism|Interpretivist]] social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically [[falsifiable]] theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense. In modern academic practice, researchers are often [[Eclecticism|eclectic]], using multiple [[Methodology|methodologies]] (for instance, by combining both [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research]]). The term "[[social research]]" has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share in its aims and methods.

==History==
{{Main|History of the social sciences}}
The history of the social sciences begins in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] after 1650,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S3zZ18tt3gkC|title=The Social Science Encyclopedia|last=Kuper|first=Adam|date=1996|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780415108294|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which saw a revolution within [[natural philosophy]], changing the basic framework by which individuals understood what was "scientific". Social sciences came forth from the [[moral philosophy]] of the time and were influenced by the [[Age of Revolution]]s, such as the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt; The ''social sciences'' developed from the [[science]]s ([[experimental science|experimental]] and [[applied science|applied]]), or the systematic knowledge-bases or prescriptive practices, relating to the [[social improvement]] of a [[community|group of interacting entities]].&lt;ref name="SocialColumbian1897"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peck1897"/&gt;

The beginnings of the social sciences in the 18th century are reflected in the [[Encyclopédie|grand encyclopedia of Diderot]], with articles from [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and other pioneers. The growth of the social sciences is also reflected in other specialized encyclopedias. The modern period saw "''social science''" first used as a distinct conceptual field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Inquiry into the Principles of the Distribution of Wealth Most Conducive to Human Happiness; applied to the Newly Proposed System of Voluntary Equality of Wealth |year=1824 |author=[[William Thompson (philosopher)|William Thompson]] (1775–1833)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social science was influenced by [[positivism]],&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt; focusing on knowledge based on actual positive sense experience and avoiding the negative; [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculation was avoided. [[Auguste Comte]] used the term "''science sociale''" to describe the field, taken from the ideas of [[Charles Fourier]]; Comte also referred to the field as ''social physics''.&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Comte, the ''social physics'' field was similar to that of [[natural sciences]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this period, there were five paths of development that sprang forth in the social sciences, influenced by Comte on other fields.&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt; One route that was taken was the rise of [[social research]]. Large [[statistical survey]]s were undertaken in various parts of the United States and Europe. Another route undertaken was initiated by [[Émile Durkheim]], studying "social facts", and [[Vilfredo Pareto]], opening metatheoretical ideas and individual theories. A third means developed, arising from the methodological dichotomy present, in which [[social phenomena]] were identified with and understood; this was championed by figures such as [[Max Weber]]. The fourth route taken, based in economics, was developed and furthered economic knowledge as a [[hard science]]. The last path was the [[correlation]] of knowledge and [[Value (ethics)|social values]]; the [[antipositivism]] and [[verstehen]] sociology of [[Max Weber]] firmly demanded this distinction. In this route, theory (description) and prescription were non-overlapping formal discussions of a subject.

Around the start of the 20th century, [[Enlightenment philosophy]] was challenged in various quarters. After the use of classical theories since the end of the scientific revolution, various fields substituted mathematics studies for experimental studies and examining equations to build a theoretical structure. The development of social science subfields became very quantitative in [[methodology]]. The [[interdisciplinary]] and cross-disciplinary nature of scientific inquiry into human behaviour, social and environmental factors affecting it, made many of the natural sciences interested in some aspects of social science methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vessuri | first1 = H. | doi = 10.1177/0011392102050001010 | title = Ethical Challenges for the Social Sciences on the Threshold of the 21st Century | journal = Current Sociology | volume = 50 | pages = 135–150 | year = 2002 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of boundary blurring include emerging disciplines like social research of [[medicine]], [[sociobiology]], [[neuropsychology]], [[bioeconomics (biophysical)|bioeconomics]] and the [[history of science|history]] and [[sociology of science]]. Increasingly, [[quantitative research]] and [[qualitative methods]] are being integrated in the study of human action and its implications and consequences. In the first half of the 20th century, statistics became a free-standing discipline of applied mathematics. Statistical methods were used confidently.

In the contemporary period, [[Karl Popper]] and [[Talcott Parsons]] influenced the furtherance of the social sciences.&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt; Researchers continue to search for a unified consensus on what methodology might have the power and refinement to connect a proposed "grand theory" with the various midrange theories that, with considerable success, continue to provide usable frameworks for massive, growing data banks; for more, see [[consilience]]. The social sciences will for the foreseeable future be composed of different zones in the research of, and sometime distinct in approach toward, the field.&lt;ref name="Kuper1985" /&gt;

The term "social science" may refer either to the specific ''sciences of society'' established by thinkers such as Comte, Durkheim, Marx, and Weber, or more generally to all disciplines outside of "noble science" and [[arts]]. By the late 19th century, the academic social sciences were constituted of five fields: [[jurisprudence]] and amendment of the [[law]], [[education]], [[health]], [[economy]] and [[trade]], and [[art]].&lt;ref name="SocialColumbian1897" /&gt;

Around the start of the 21st century, the expanding domain of [[economics]] in the social sciences has been described as [[economic imperialism (economics)|economic imperialism]].&lt;ref name="Imperialism"/&gt;

The social science disciplines are branches of knowledge taught and researched at the college or university level. Social science disciplines are defined and recognized by the [[academic journal]]s in which research is published, and the learned social science societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong. Social science fields of study usually have several sub-disciplines or branches, and the distinguishing lines between these are often both arbitrary and ambiguous.

===Anthropology===
{{Main|Anthropology|Outline of anthropology}}

[[Anthropology]] is the holistic "science of man", a science of the totality of human existence. The discipline deals with the integration of different aspects of the social sciences, [[humanities]], and [[human biology]]. In the twentieth century, academic disciplines have often been institutionally divided into three broad domains. The ''natural sciences'' seek to derive general laws through reproducible and verifiable experiments. The ''humanities'' generally study local traditions, through their history, literature, music, and arts, with an emphasis on understanding particular individuals, events, or eras. The ''social sciences'' have generally attempted to develop scientific methods to understand social phenomena in a generalizable way, though usually with methods distinct from those of the natural sciences.

The anthropological social sciences often develop nuanced descriptions rather than the general laws derived in physics or chemistry, or they may explain individual cases through more general principles, as in many fields of psychology. Anthropology (like some fields of history) does not easily fit into one of these categories, and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wallerstein | first1 = I. | title = Anthropology, Sociology, and Other Dubious Disciplines | doi = 10.1086/375868 | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 453–465 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the United States, anthropology is divided into four sub-fields: [[archaeology]], [[Physical Anthropology|physical]] or [[Physical Anthropology|biological anthropology]], [[anthropological linguistics]], and [[cultural anthropology]]. It is an area that is offered at most undergraduate institutions. The word ''anthropos'' (ἄνθρωπος) in [[Ancient Greek]] means "human being" or "person". [[Eric Wolf]] described sociocultural anthropology as "the most scientific of the humanities, and the most humanistic of the sciences."

The goal of anthropology is to provide a [[Holism|holistic]] account of humans and human nature. This means that, though anthropologists generally specialize in only one sub-field, they always keep in mind the biological, linguistic, historic and cultural aspects of any problem. Since anthropology arose as a science in Western societies that were complex and industrial, a major trend within anthropology has been a methodological drive to study peoples in societies with more simple social organization, sometimes called "primitive" in anthropological literature, but without any connotation of "inferior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lowie |first=Robert |title=Primitive Religion |publisher=Routledge and Sons |year=1924}}; {{cite book |last=Tylor |first=Edward |year=1920 |title=Primitive Culture |location=New York: |publisher=J. P. Putnam's Sons}} Originally published 1871.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, anthropologists use terms such as "less complex" societies or refer to specific modes of [[subsistence]] or [[Modes of production|production]], such as "pastoralist" or "forager" or "horticulturalist" to refer to humans living in non-industrial, non-Western cultures, such people or folk (''ethnos'') remaining of great interest within anthropology.

The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a people in detail, using biogenetic, archaeological, and linguistic data alongside direct observation of contemporary customs.&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, Serena and Richard Warms. ''Culture Counts''. Wadsworth. 2008. Chapter One&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. It is possible to view all human cultures as part of one large, evolving global culture. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.&lt;ref&gt;Rosaldo, Renato. ''Culture and Truth: The remaking of social analysis''. Beacon Press. 1993; Inda, John Xavier and Renato Rosaldo. ''The Anthropology of Globalization''. Wiley-Blackwell. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication studies===
{{Main|Communication studies|History of communication studies}}
Communication studies deals with processes of human [[communication]], commonly defined as the sharing of [[symbols]] to create [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. The discipline encompasses a range of topics, from face-to-face [[conversation]] to mass media outlets such as [[television broadcasting]]. Communication studies also examines how messages are interpreted through the political, cultural, economic, and social dimensions of their contexts. Communication is institutionalized under many different names at different universities, including "communication", "communication studies", "speech communication", "rhetorical studies", "communication science", "[[media studies]]", "communication arts", "[[mass communication]]", "[[media ecology]]", and "communication and media science".

Communication studies integrates aspects of both social sciences and the humanities. As a social science, the discipline often overlaps with sociology, psychology, anthropology, biology, political science, economics, and public policy, among others. From a humanities perspective, communication is concerned with rhetoric and persuasion (traditional graduate programs in communication studies trace their history to the rhetoricians of Ancient Greece). The field applies to outside disciplines as well, including engineering, architecture, mathematics, and information science.

===Economics===
{{Main|Economics|Outline of economics}}
[[Economics]] is a social science that seeks to analyze and describe the production, distribution, and consumption of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109547?query=Economics&amp;ct= economics – Britannica Online Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; The word "economics" is from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|οἶκος}} ''oikos'', "family, household, estate", and νόμος ''nomos'', "custom, law", and hence means "household management" or "management of the state". An [[economist]] is a person using economic concepts and data in the course of employment, or someone who has earned a [[academic degree|degree]] in the subject. The classic brief definition of economics, set out by [[Lionel Robbins]] in 1932, is "the science which studies human behavior as a relation between scarce means having alternative uses". Without scarcity and alternative uses, there is no [[economic problem]]. Briefer yet is "the study of how people seek to satisfy needs and wants" and "the study of the financial aspects of human behavior".

|[[File:Market-Chichicastenango.jpg|thumb|right|Buyers bargain for good prices while sellers put forth their best front in [[Chichicastenango]] Market, [[Guatemala]].]]
|}
Economics has two broad branches: [[microeconomics]], where the unit of analysis is the individual agent, such as a household or firm, and [[macroeconomics]], where the unit of analysis is an economy as a whole. Another division of the subject distinguishes [[positive (social sciences)|positive]] economics, which seeks to predict and explain economic phenomena, from [[normative economics]], which orders choices and actions by some criterion; such orderings necessarily involve [[Subjectivity|subjective]] value judgments. Since the early part of the 20th century, economics has focused largely on measurable quantities, employing both theoretical models and empirical analysis. Quantitative models, however, can be traced as far back as the [[physiocrats|physiocratic school]]. Economic reasoning has been increasingly applied in recent decades to other social situations such as [[public choice theory|politics]], [[law]], [[Experimental economics|psychology]], [[Economic history|history]], [[religion]], marriage and family life, and other social interactions.
This paradigm crucially assumes (1) that resources are scarce because they are not sufficient to satisfy all wants, and (2) that "economic value" is willingness to pay as revealed for instance by market (arms' length) transactions. Rival [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] schools of thought, such as [[institutional economics]], [[green economics]], [[Marxist economics]], and [[economic sociology]], make other grounding assumptions. For example, Marxist economics assumes that economics primarily deals with the investigation of [[exchange value]], of which human labour is the source.

The expanding domain of economics in the social sciences has been described as [[economic imperialism (economics)|economic imperialism]].&lt;ref name="Imperialism"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Becker|Becker, Gary S.]] (1976).

===Education===
{{Main|Education|Outline of education}}
[[File:Laurentius de Voltolina 001.jpg|thumb|right|A depiction of world's oldest university, the [[University of Bologna]], in Italy]]
Education [[List of education topics|encompasses]] teaching and learning specific skills, and also something less tangible but more profound: the imparting of knowledge, positive judgement and well-developed wisdom. Education has as one of its fundamental aspects the imparting of culture from generation to generation (see [[socialization]]). To educate means 'to draw out', from the [[Latin]] ''educare'', or to facilitate the realization of an individual's potential and talents. It is an application of [[pedagogy]], a body of theoretical and applied research relating to teaching and learning and draws on many disciplines such as [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], [[computer science]], [[linguistics]], [[neuroscience]], [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachersmind.com/education.htm An overview of education]&lt;/ref&gt;

The education of an individual human begins at birth and continues throughout life. (Some believe that education begins even before birth, as evidenced by some parents' playing music or reading to the baby in the womb in the hope it will influence the child's development.) For some, the struggles and triumphs of daily [[personal life|life]] provide far more instruction than does formal schooling (thus [[Mark Twain]]'s admonition to "never let school interfere with your education"). Family members may have a profound educational effect&amp;nbsp;— often more profound than they realize&amp;nbsp;— though family teaching may function very informally.

===Geography===
{{Main|Geography|Outline of geography}}
[[File:Physical world.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the Earth]]
Geography as a discipline can be split broadly into two main sub fields: [[human geography]] and [[physical geography]]. The former focuses largely on the built environment and how space is created, viewed and managed by humans as well as the influence humans have on the space they occupy. This may involve [[cultural geography]], [[Transportation geography|transportation]], [[Health geography|health]], [[Military geography|military operations]], and [[Urban geography|cities]]. The latter examines the natural environment and how the climate, vegetation and life, soil, [[Oceanography|oceans]], water and [[landforms]] are produced and interact.&lt;ref name="What is geography?"/&gt; [[Physical geography]] examines phenomena related to the [[Geodesy|measurement of earth]]. As a result of the two subfields using different approaches a third field has emerged, which is [[environmental geography]]. Environmental geography combines physical and human geography and looks at the interactions between the environment and humans.&lt;ref name="Hayes-Bohanan"/&gt; Other [[Geography#Branches|branches of geography]] include [[social geography]], [[regional geography]], and [[geomatics]].

Geographers attempt to understand the Earth in terms of physical and spatial relationships. The first geographers focused on the science of [[mapmaking]] and finding ways to precisely [[Map projection|project]] the surface of the earth. In this sense, geography bridges some gaps between the natural sciences and social sciences. [[Historical geography]] is often taught in a college in a unified Department of Geography.

Modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline, closely related to [[Geographic Information Science|GISc]], that seeks to understand humanity and its natural environment. The fields of [[urban planning]], [[regional science]], and [[planetology]] are closely related to geography. Practitioners of geography use many technologies and methods to collect data such as [[Geographic Information Systems|GIS]], [[remote sensing]], [[aerial photography]], [[statistics]], and [[global positioning systems]] (GPS).

===History===
{{Main|History|Outline of history}}

History is the continuous, systematic narrative and research into past human events as interpreted through historiographical paradigms or theories.

History has a base in both the social sciences and the humanities. In the United States the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] includes history in its definition of [[humanities]] (as it does for applied linguistics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About NEH |publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities |url=http://www.neh.gov/about}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] classifies history as a social science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/readingroom/books/researchdoc/summary.html Research-Doctorate Programs in the United States: Continuity and Change]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[historical method]] comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]]. The [[Social Science History Association]], formed in 1976, brings together scholars from numerous disciplines interested in [[social history]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ssha.org/ the SSHA website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law===
{{Main|Law|Outline of law}}
[[File:Old Bailey Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|right|A trial at a criminal court, the [[Old Bailey]] in London]]
The social science of law, [[jurisprudence]], in common parlance, means a rule that (unlike a rule of [[ethics]]) is capable of enforcement through institutions.&lt;ref name="Crimes Against Humanity"/&gt; However, many laws are based on [[norm (philosophy)|norms]] accepted by a community and thus have an ethical foundation. The study of law crosses the boundaries between the social sciences and humanities, depending on one's view of research into its objectives and effects. Law is not always enforceable, especially in the international relations context. It has been defined as a "system of rules",&lt;ref name="hhc"/&gt; as an "interpretive concept"&lt;ref name="rdl"/&gt; to achieve justice, as an "authority"&lt;ref name="jra"/&gt; to mediate people's interests, and even as "the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction".&lt;ref name="jap"/&gt; However one likes to think of law, it is a completely central social institution. Legal policy incorporates the practical manifestation of thinking from almost every social science and the humanities. Laws are politics, because politicians create them. Law is philosophy, because moral and ethical persuasions shape their ideas. Law tells many of history's stories, because statutes, case law and codifications build up over time. And law is economics, because any rule about [[contract]], [[tort]], [[property law]], [[labour law]], [[company law]] and many more can have long-lasting effects on the distribution of wealth. The noun ''law'' derives from the late [[Old English language|Old English]] ''lagu'', meaning something laid down or fixed&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=law&amp;searchmode=none Etymonline Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and the adjective ''legal'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''lex''.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/legal ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistics===
{{Main|Linguistics|Outline of linguistics}}
[[File:Ferdinand de Saussure.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ferdinand de Saussure]], recognized as the father of modern [[linguistics]]]]
Linguistics investigates the cognitive and social aspects of human language. The field is divided into areas that focus on aspects of the linguistic signal, such as [[syntax]] (the study of the rules that govern the structure of sentences), [[semantics]] (the study of meaning), [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the study of the structure of words), [[phonetics]] (the study of speech sounds) and [[phonology]] (the study of the abstract sound system of a particular language); however, work in areas like [[evolutionary linguistics]] (the study of the origins and evolution of language) and [[psycholinguistics]] (the study of psychological factors in human language) cut across these divisions.

The overwhelming majority of modern research in linguistics takes a predominantly [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] perspective (focusing on language at a particular point in time), and a great deal of it—partly owing to the influence of [[Noam Chomsky]]—aims at formulating theories of the cognitive processing of language. However, language does not exist in a vacuum, or only in the brain, and approaches like contact linguistics, [[Creole language|creole]] studies, [[discourse analysis]], social interactional linguistics, and [[sociolinguistics]] explore language in its social context. Sociolinguistics often makes use of traditional quantitative analysis and [[statistics]] in investigating the frequency of features, while some disciplines, like contact linguistics, focus on qualitative analysis. While certain areas of linguistics can thus be understood as clearly falling within the social sciences, other areas, like [[acoustic phonetics]] and [[neurolinguistics]], draw on the natural sciences. Linguistics draws only secondarily on the humanities, which played a rather greater role in linguistic inquiry in the 19th and early 20th centuries. [[Ferdinand Saussure]] is considered the father of modern linguistics.

===Political science===
{{Main|Political science|Outline of political science|Politics}}
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aristotle]] asserted that man is a political animal in his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ebenstein, Alan (2002). Introduction to Political Thinkers. Boston, Massachusetts: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Political science]] is an academic and research discipline that deals with the theory and practice of politics and the description and analysis of [[political system]]s and political behaviour. Fields and subfields of political science include [[political economy]], [[political philosophy|political theory and philosophy]], [[civics]] and [[comparative politics]], theory of [[direct democracy]], apolitical governance, participatory direct democracy, national systems, cross-national political analysis, political development, [[international relations]], [[foreign policy]], [[international law]], politics, [[public administration]], administrative behaviour, public law, judicial behaviour, and [[Policy|public policy]]. Political science also studies [[power in international relations]] and the theory of [[great powers]] and [[superpower]]s.

Political science is methodologically diverse, although recent years have witnessed an upsurge in the use of the scientific method,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn = 978-1403934222|title = Rational Choice|last1 = Hindmoor|first1 = Andrew|date = 2006-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2014}} that is, the proliferation of formal-deductive model building and quantitative hypothesis testing. Approaches to the discipline include [[rational choice]], classical political philosophy, [[Interpretivism (social science)|interpretivism]], [[structuralism]], and [[behavioralism|behaviouralism]], [[Philosophical realism|realism]], pluralism, and [[Institutionalism in political parties|institutionalism]]. Political science, as one of the social sciences, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: primary sources such as historical documents, interviews, and official records, as well as secondary sources such as [[scholarly article]]s are used in building and testing theories. Empirical methods include [[sample survey|survey]] research, [[statistical analysis]] [[econometrics|or econometrics]], [[case studies]], experiments, and model building. [[Herbert Baxter Adams]] is credited with coining the phrase "political science" while teaching history at [[Johns Hopkins University]].

===Psychology===
{{Main|Psychology|Outline of psychology}}
[[File:Wundt-research-group.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt]] was the founder of [[experimental psychology]].]]
[[Psychology]] is an academic and applied field involving the study of behaviour and mental processes. Psychology also refers to the application of such knowledge to various spheres of human activity, including problems of individuals' [[everyday life|daily lives]] and the treatment of [[mental illness]]. The word ''psychology'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ψυχή ''[[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]'' ("soul", "mind") and ''[[-logy|logy]]'' ("study").

Psychology differs from [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[political science]], and [[sociology]] in seeking to capture explanatory generalizations about the [[mental function]] and overt behaviour of individuals, while the other disciplines focus on creating descriptive generalizations about the functioning of social groups or situation-specific human behaviour. In practice, however, there is quite a lot of cross-fertilization that takes place among the various fields. Psychology differs from [[biology]] and [[neuroscience]] in that it is primarily concerned with the interaction of mental processes and behaviour, and of the overall processes of a system, and not simply the biological or neural processes themselves, though the subfield of [[neuropsychology]] combines the study of the actual neural processes with the study of the mental effects they have subjectively produced.
Many people associate psychology with clinical psychology, which focuses on assessment and treatment of problems in living and psychopathology. In reality, psychology has myriad specialties including social psychology, developmental psychology, cognitive psychology, [[educational psychology]], industrial-organizational psychology, [[mathematical psychology]], neuropsychology, and quantitative analysis of behaviour.

Psychology is a very broad science that is rarely tackled as a whole, major block. Although some subfields encompass a natural science base and a social science application, others can be clearly distinguished as having little to do with the social sciences or having a lot to do with the social sciences. For example, biological psychology is considered a natural science with a social scientific application (as is clinical [[medicine]]), social and occupational psychology are, generally speaking, purely social sciences, whereas neuropsychology is a natural science that lacks application out of the scientific tradition entirely. In British universities, emphasis on what tenet of psychology a student has studied and/or concentrated is communicated through the degree conferred: B.Psy. indicates a balance between natural and social sciences, B.Sc. indicates a strong (or entire) scientific concentration, whereas a B.A. underlines a majority of social science credits. This is not always necessarily the case however, and in many UK institutions students studying the B.Psy, B.Sc, and B.A. follow the same curriculum as outlined by The British Psychological Society and have the same options of specialism open to them regardless of whether they choose a balance, a heavy science basis, or heavy social science basis to their degree. If they applied to read the B.A. for example, but specialized in heavily science-based modules, then they will still generally be awarded the B.A.

===Sociology===
{{Main|Sociology|Outline of sociology}}
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|right|[[Émile Durkheim]] is considered one of the founding fathers of sociology.]]
[[Sociology]] is the systematic study of society, individuals' relationship to their societies, the consequences of difference, and other aspects of human [[social action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=SOC 218|last=Witt|first=Jon|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2018|isbn=9781259702723|location=|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the word comes from the suffix "-logy", which means "study of", derived from [[Ancient Greek]], and the stem "soci-", which is from the [[Latin]] word ''socius'', meaning "companion", or society in general.

[[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) coined the term, Sociology, as a way to apply natural science principles and techniques to the social world in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Sociology'', Article: Comte, Auguste&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=SOC 2018|last=Witt|first=Jon|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2018|isbn=9781259702723|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comte endeavoured to unify history, psychology and economics through the descriptive understanding of the social realm. He proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological [[positivism]], an epistemological approach outlined in ''The Course in Positive Philosophy'' [1830–1842] and ''[[A General View of Positivism]]'' (1844). Though Comte is generally regarded as the "Father of Sociology", the discipline was formally established by another French thinker, [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917), who developed positivism as a foundation to practical [[social research]]. Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1895, publishing his ''[[Rules of the Sociological Method]]''. In 1896, he established the journal ''[[Année Sociologique|L'Année Sociologique]]''. Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a case study of suicide rates among [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations, distinguished sociological analysis from [[psychology]] or [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gianfranco Poggi (2000). ''Durkheim.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press. Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Marx]] rejected Comte's positivism but nevertheless aimed to establish a ''science of society'' based on [[historical materialism]], becoming recognized as a founding figure of sociology posthumously as the term gained broader meaning. Around the start of the 20th century, the first wave of German sociologists, including [[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]], developed sociological [[antipositivism]]. The field may be broadly recognized as an amalgam of three modes of social thought in particular: Durkheimian [[positivism]] and [[structural functionalism]]; Marxist [[historical materialism]] and [[conflict theory]]; and Weberian [[antipositivism]] and [[verstehen]] analysis. American sociology broadly arose on a separate trajectory, with little Marxist influence, an emphasis on rigorous experimental methodology, and a closer association with [[pragmatism]] and [[social psychology]]. In the 1920s, the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] developed [[symbolic interactionism]]. Meanwhile, in the 1930s, the [[Frankfurt School]] pioneered the idea of [[critical theory]], an interdisciplinary form of [[Marxist sociology]] drawing upon thinkers as diverse as [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Critical theory would take on something of a life of its own after World War II, influencing [[literary criticism]] and the [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies|Birmingham School]] establishment of [[cultural studies]].

Sociology evolved as an academic response to the challenges of [[modernity]], such as [[industrialization]], [[urbanization]], [[secularization]], and a perceived process of enveloping [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]].&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen, ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]: Modernity's Consciousness of Time'', Polity Press (1990), paperback, {{ISBN|0-7456-0830-2}}&amp;nbsp;[[Special:BookSources/0-7456-0830-2|0-7456-0830-2]], p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The field generally concerns the [[social rule]]s and processes that bind and separate people not only as [[individual]]s, but as members of [[Voluntary association|associations]], [[Group (sociology)|groups]], [[Community|communities]] and [[social institution|institutions]], and includes the examination of the organization and development of human social life. The sociological field of interest ranges from the analysis of short [[Social relation|contacts]] between anonymous individuals on the street to the study of [[globalization|global social processes]]. In the terms of [[Sociology|sociologists]] [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]], social scientists seek an understanding of the ''[[Social Construction of Reality]]''. Most sociologists work in one or more [[Subfields of sociology|subfields]]. One useful way to describe the discipline is as a cluster of sub-fields that examine different dimensions of society. For example, [[social stratification]] studies inequality and class structure; [[demography]] studies changes in a population size or type; [[criminology]] examines criminal behaviour and deviance; and [[political sociology]] studies the interaction between society and state.

Since its inception, sociological epistemologies, methods, and frames of enquiry, have significantly expanded and diverged.&lt;ref name="Giddens Intro"/&gt; Sociologists use a diversity of research methods, collect both quantitative and qualitative data, draw upon empirical techniques, and engage [[critical theory]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Common modern methods include [[case studies]], [[historiography|historical research]], [[interviewing]], [[participant observation]], [[social network analysis]], [[statistical survey|survey]] research, [[statistical analysis]], and model building, among other approaches. Since the late 1970s, many sociologists have tried to make the discipline useful for purposes beyond the academy. The results of sociological research aid educators, lawmakers, administrators, developers, and others interested in resolving social problems and formulating public policy, through subdisciplinary areas such as [[evaluation research]], methodological assessment, and [[public sociology]].

In the early 1970s, women sociologists began to question sociological paradigms and the invisibility of women in sociological studies, analysis, and courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paradoxes of Gender|last=Lorber|first=Judith|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1994|isbn=9780300064971|location=New Haven, CT|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, feminist sociologists challenged the discipline's [[androcentrism]] at the American Sociological Association's annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socwomen.org/sws-activism/|title=The Founding of SWS|last=Laube|first=Heather|last2=Hess|first2=Bess B.|date=2001|website=Sociologists for Women in Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the founding of the organization Sociologists for Women in Society, and, eventually, a new sociology journal, [[Gender &amp; Society]]. Today, the [[sociology of gender]] is considered to be one of the most prominent sub-fields in the discipline.

New sociological sub-fields continue to appear&amp;nbsp;— such as [[community studies]], [[computational sociology]], [[environmental sociology]], [[Social network analysis|network analysis]], [[actor-network theory]], gender studies, and a growing list, many of which are [[List of academic disciplines|cross-disciplinary]] in nature.

==Additional fields of study==

==Methodology==

===Social research===
{{Main|Social research}}
The origin of the [[Statistical survey|survey]] can be traced back at least early as the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086,&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Halsey (2004), ''A history of sociology in Britain: science, literature, and society'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Duncan Mitchell (1970), ''A new dictionary of sociology'', p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; while some scholars pinpoint the origin of [[demography]] to 1663 with the publication of [[John Graunt]]'s ''Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality''.&lt;ref&gt;Willcox, Walter (1938) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1400906 ''The Founder of Statistics''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Social research began most intentionally, however, with the [[positivist]] [[philosophy of science]] in the 19th century.

In contemporary usage, "social research" is a relatively autonomous term, encompassing the work of practitioners from various disciplines that share in its aims and methods. Social scientists employ a range of methods in order to analyse a vast breadth of social phenomena; from [[census]] survey data derived from millions of individuals, to the in-depth analysis of a single agent's social experiences; from monitoring what is happening on contemporary streets, to the investigation of ancient historical documents. The methods originally rooted in classical sociology and statistical mathematics have formed the basis for research in other disciplines, such as [[political science]], [[media studies]], and [[marketing]] and [[market research]].

Social research methods may be divided into two broad schools:
* [[Quantitative method|Quantitative designs]] approach social phenomena through quantifiable evidence, and often rely on statistical analysis of many cases (or across intentionally designed treatments in an experiment) to create valid and reliable general claims.
* [[Qualitative research|Qualitative designs]] emphasize understanding of social phenomena through direct observation, communication with participants, or analysis of texts, and may stress contextual and subjective accuracy over generality.

Social scientists will commonly combine quantitative and qualitative approaches as part of a multi-strategy design. Questionnaires, field-based data collection, archival database information and laboratory-based data collections are some of the measurement techniques used. It is noted the importance of measurement and analysis, focusing on the (difficult to achieve) goal of objective research or [[statistical hypothesis testing]]. A [[mathematical model]] uses mathematical language to describe a system. The process of developing a mathematical model is termed 'mathematical modelling' (also modeling). Eykhoff (1974) defined a ''mathematical model'' as 'a representation of the essential aspects of an existing [[system]] (or a system to be constructed) that presents knowledge of that system in usable form'.&lt;ref&gt;Eykhoff, Pieter ''System Identification: Parameter and State Estimation'', Wiley &amp; Sons, (1974). {{ISBN|0-471-24980-7}}&amp;nbsp;[[Special:BookSources/0-471-24980-7|0-471-24980-7]]&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematical models can take many forms, including but not limited to [[dynamical systems]], [[statistical model]]s, [[differential equations]], or [[Game theory|game theoretic models]].

These and other types of models can overlap, with a given model involving a variety of abstract structures. The [[system]] is a set of interacting or interdependent entities, real or abstract, forming an integrated whole. The concept of an ''integrated whole'' can also be stated in terms of a system embodying a set of relationships that are differentiated from relationships of the set to other elements, and from relationships between an element of the set and elements not a part of the relational regime. A [[dynamical system]] modeled as a [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[formal system|formalization]] has a fixed "rule" that describes the time dependence of a point's position in its [[ambient space]]. Small changes in the state of the system correspond to small changes in the numbers. The ''evolution rule'' of the dynamical system is a [[function (mathematics)|fixed rule]] that describes what future states follow from the current state. The rule is [[Deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]]: for a given time interval only one future state follows from the current state.

Social sciences are criticized for neglecting the moral element of human behavior. Economists tend to focus on self-interest. Clinical psychologists—on the effects of early socialization. Anthropologists tend to assume moral relativism. Sociologists often blame the System for immoral behavior. Socio-biologists tend to assume limited choice behavior. All this, critics hold, contrasts with the fact that life is a constant wrestle between people's moral commitments and urges that pull them to violate these commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Amitai Etzioni. 2017.

===Theory===
{{Main|Social theory}}
Other social scientists emphasize the subjective nature of research. These writers share social theory perspectives that include various types of the following:
* [[Critical theory]] is the examination and critique of society and culture, drawing from knowledge across social sciences and humanities disciplines.
* [[Dialectical materialism]] is the philosophy of Karl Marx, which he formulated by taking the dialectic of Hegel and joining it to the materialism of Feuerbach.
* [[Feminist theory]] is the extension of feminism into theoretical, or philosophical discourse; it aims to understand the nature of gender inequality.
* [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theories]], such as [[Proletarian revolution|revolutionary theory]] and [[Class conflict|class theory]], cover work in philosophy that is strongly influenced by Karl Marx's materialist approach to theory or is written by Marxists.
* [[Phronetic social science]] is a theory and methodology for doing social science focusing on ethics and political power, based on a contemporary interpretation of Aristotelian phronesis.
* [[Post-colonialism|Post-colonial theory]] is a reaction to the cultural legacy of colonialism.
* [[Postmodernism]] refers to a point of departure for works of literature, drama, architecture, cinema, and design, as well as in marketing and business and in the interpretation of history, law, culture and religion in the late 20th century.
* [[Rational choice theory]] is a framework for understanding and often formally modeling social and economic behaviour.
* [[Social constructionism]] considers how social phenomena develop in social contexts.
* [[Structuralism]] is an approach to the human sciences that attempts to analyze a specific field (for instance, mythology) as a complex system of interrelated parts.
* [[Structural functionalism]] is a sociological paradigm that addresses what social functions various elements of the social system perform in regard to the entire system.

Other fringe social scientists delve in alternative nature of research. These writers share social theory perspectives that include various types of the following:
* [[Anti-intellectualism|Intellectual critical-ism]] describes a sentiment of critique towards, or evaluation of, intellectuals and intellectual pursuits.
* [[Antiscience|Scientific criticalism]] is a position critical of science and the scientific method.

== Education and degrees ==
Most universities offer degrees in social science fields.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson's (Firm&amp;nbsp;: 2006– ). (2007). Peterson's graduate programs in the humanities, arts, &amp; social sciences, 2007. Lawrenceville, New Jersey: Peterson's.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bachelor of Social Science]] is a degree targeted at the social sciences in particular. It is often more flexible and in-depth than other degrees that include social science subjects.{{efn|A [[Bachelor of Social Science]] degree can be earned at the [[University of Adelaide]], [[University of Waikato]] ([[Hamilton, New Zealand]]), [[University of Sydney]], [[University of New South Wales]], [[University of Hong Kong]], [[University of Manchester]], [[Lincoln University, New Zealand]], [[National University of Malaysia]] and [[University of Queensland]].}}

In the United States, a university may offer a student who studies a social sciences field a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, particularly if the field is within one of the traditional [[liberal arts]] such as history, or a BSc: Bachelor of Science degree such as those given by the London School of Economics, as the social sciences constitute one of the two main branches of [[science]] (the other being the [[natural sciences]]). In addition, some institutions have degrees for a particular social science, such as the [[Bachelor of Economics]] degree, though such specialized degrees are relatively rare in the United States.

One study calculated the impact of injecting sulfate particles, or [[aerosols]], every one to four years into the [[stratosphere]] in amounts equal to those lofted by the volcanic eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in 1991,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = T.

It has been suggested that the direct delivery of precursors could be achieved using sulfide gases such as [[dimethyl sulfide]], [[sulfur dioxide]] ({{chem|S|O|2}}), [[carbonyl sulfide]], or [[hydrogen sulfide]] ({{chem|H|2|S}}).&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt; These compounds would be delivered using artillery, aircraft (such as the high-flying [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15C]])&lt;ref name="aircraft"/&gt; or balloons, and result in the formation of compounds with the sulfate [[anion]] SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt;

According to estimates, "one kilogram of well placed sulfur in the stratosphere would roughly offset the warming effect of several hundred thousand kilograms of carbon dioxide."&lt;ref name="CFR1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/18635/|title=The Geoengineering Option:A Last Resort Against Global Warming? |author=[[David G.

* '''Cost''': Numerous studies have concluded that SAI would cost less than many other interventions.  Costs cannot be derived in a wholly objective fashion, as pricing can only be roughly estimated at an early stage. However, many sources suggest that it would be cheap relative to cutting emissions, capturing carbon dioxide, adapting to climate impacts, or suffering climate damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126973.600-hacking-the-planet-the-only-climate-solution-left.html?full=true|title=Hacking the planet: The only climate solution left?

* '''Efficacy''': Most proposed solar radiation management techniques can only provide a limited intervention in the climate—one cannot reduce the temperature by more than a certain amount with each technique.  Research has suggested that this technique may have a high radiative 'forcing potential'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net/9/2559/2009/acpd-9-2559-2009.pdf|title=Radiative forcing potential of climate geoengineering|last=Lenton|first=Tim|author2=Vaughan|accessdate=February 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficacy issues==

It is uncertain how effective any solar radiation management technique would be, due to the difficulties modeling their impacts and the complex nature of the global [[climate system]].  Certain efficacy issues are specific to stratospheric aerosols.

*'''Lifespan of aerosols''': Tropospheric sulfur aerosols are short lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_/ai_12140641 | work=Science News | title=Haze clouds the greenhouse—sulfur pollution slows global warming—includes related article | first=Richard | last=Monastersky | year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Delivery of particles into the lower stratosphere in the arctic will typically ensure that they remain aloft only for a few weeks or months, as air in this region is predominantly descending.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crosswalk.com/news/11572945/&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure endurance, higher-altitude delivery is needed, ensuring a typical endurance of several years by enabling injection into the rising leg of the [[Brewer-Dobson circulation]] above the tropical [[tropopause]].

*'''Aerosol delivery''': There are two proposals for how to create a stratospheric sulfate aerosol cloud, either through release of a precursor gas ({{chem|S|O|2}}) or the direct release of sulfuric acid ({{chem|H|2|S|O|4}}) and these face different challenges.&lt;ref name="Pierce L18805"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Efficient formation of stratospheric aerosol for climate engineering by emission of condensible vapor from aircraft|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2010GL043975/abstract|journal = Geophysical Research Letters|date = 2010-09-01|issn = 1944-8007|pages = L18805|volume = 37|issue = 18|doi = 10.1029/2010GL043975|language = en|first = Jeffrey R.|last = Pierce|first2 = Debra K.|last2 = Weisenstein|first3 = Patricia|last3 = Heckendorn|first4 = Thomas|last4 = Peter|first5 = David W.|last5 = Keith|bibcode = 2010GeoRL..3718805P}}&lt;/ref&gt; If {{chem|S|O|2}} gas is released it will oxidise to form {{chem|H|2|S|O|4}} and then condense to form droplets far from the injection site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The dependency of geoengineered sulfate aerosol on the emission strategy|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asl.304/abstract|journal = Atmospheric Science Letters|date = 2011-04-01|issn = 1530-261X|pages = 189–194|volume = 12|issue = 2|doi = 10.1002/asl.304|language = en|first = U.|last = Niemeier|first2 = H.|last2 = Schmidt|first3 = C.|last3 = Timmreck}}&lt;/ref&gt; Releasing {{chem|S|O|2}} would not allow control over the size of the particles that are formed but would not require a sophisticated release mechanism.

==Possible side effects==
{{Main|Stratospheric sulfur aerosols#Effects}}
Climate engineering and solar radiation management in general are controversial, and pose various problems and risks. However, certain problems are specific to, or more pronounced with this particular technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = A.| title = 20 reasons why geoengineering may be a bad idea| journal = Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists| volume = 64| issue = 2| pages = 14–19| year = 2008| last1 = Robock| doi = 10.2968/064002006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extreme temperature anomalies would also still increase, but to a lesser degree. In regards to these model results, the author of the study [[Alan Robock]] noted:

{{quote|If geoengineering were halted all at once, there would be rapid temperature and precipitation increases at 5–10 times the rates from gradual global warming.&lt;ref name=Robock2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/RobockStratAerosolGeo.pdf|title=Stratospheric Aerosol Geoengineering|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|year=2015|author=Alan Robock|doi=10.1063/1.4916181}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* '''Stratospheric temperature change''': Aerosols can also absorb some radiation from the Sun, the Earth and the surrounding atmosphere. This changes the surrounding air temperature and could potentially impact on the stratospheric circulation, which in turn may impact the surface circulation.&lt;ref&gt;

* '''Regional hydrologic responses''': Based on the results of the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project, there would be a reduction in the global average precipitation around the world, particularly in summer monsoon regions.&lt;ref name=Robock2014 /&gt;
*'''Health effects''': Whilst the sulfate particles are natural, they still have potential health effects.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4102961&lt;/ref&gt; Minimising these effects is principally achieved by ensuring the particles stay aloft as long as possible, thus reducing the tonnages returning into the lower atmosphere.

==Aerosol formation==

Primary aerosol formation, also known as homogeneous aerosol formation, results when gaseous {{chem|S|O|2}} combines with oxygen and water to form [[aqueous]] [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).  This acidic liquid solution is in the form of a [[vapor]] and [[condenses]] onto particles of solid matter, either [[meteor]]itic in origin or from dust carried from the surface to the stratosphere.  Secondary or heterogeneous [[aerosol]] formation occurs when H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; vapor condenses onto existing aerosol particles.  Existing aerosol particles or [[droplets]] also run into each other, creating larger particles or droplets in a process known as [[coagulation]]. Warmer atmospheric temperatures also lead to larger particles. These larger particles would be less effective at scattering [[sunlight]] because the peak light scattering is achieved by particles with a diameter of 0.3 μm.&lt;ref name="aerosols"&gt;{{cite journal

The latitude and distribution of injection locations has been discussed by various authors.

Almost all work to date on stratospheric sulfate injection has been limited to modelling and laboratory work.

In 2015, a group based at Harvard University has described a potential field experiment to test the possible damage to stratospheric ozone from stratospheric sulfate injection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dykema|first1=John A.|title=Stratospheric controlled perturbation experiment: a small-scale experiment to improve understanding of the risks of solar geoengineering|journal=Phil.

==Governance==
Most of the existing governance of stratospheric sulfate aerosols is from that which is applicable to solar radiation management more broadly. However, some existing legal instruments would be relevant to stratospheric sulfate aerosols specifically. At the international level, the [[Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution]] (CLRTAP Convention) obligates those countries which have ratified it to reduce their emissions of particular transboundary air pollutants. Notably, both solar radiation management and climate change (as well as greenhouse gases) could satisfy the definition of "air pollution" which the signatories commit to reduce, depending on their actual negative effects.&lt;ref&gt;Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution art. 1, Nov. 13, 1979, 1302 U.N.T.S. 219, Article 1&lt;/ref&gt; Commitments to  specific values of the pollutants, including sulfates, are made through protocols to the CLRTAP Convention. Full implementation or large scale climate response field tests of stratospheric sulfate aerosols could cause countries to exceed their limits. However, because stratospheric injections would be spread across the globe instead of concentrated in a few nearby countries, and could lead to net reductions in the "air pollution" which the CLRTAP Convention is to reduce, it is uncertain how the convention's Implementation Committee and Executive Body would respond to such event.

The stratospheric injection of sulfate aerosols would cause the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]] to be applicable, due to their possible deleterious effects on stratospheric ozone. That treaty generally obligates its Parties to enact policies to control activities which "have or are likely to have adverse effects resulting from modification or likely modification of the ozone layer."&lt;ref&gt;Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, opened for
signature Mar. 22, 1985, 1513 U.N.T.S. 293, Article  1&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Montreal Protocol]] to the Vienna Convention prohibits the production of certain ozone depleting substances, via phase outs. Sulfates are presently not among the prohibited substances.

In the United States, the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] might give the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] authority to regulate stratospheric sulfate aerosols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hester|first1=Tracy D.|title=Remaking the World to Save it: Applying U.S. Environmental Laws to Climate Engineering Projects|journal=Ecology Law Quarterly|date=2011|volume=38|issue=4|pages=876–880|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/elq/vol38/iss4/2/|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11053">'''Superdiversity''', or '''super-diversity''', is a [[social science]] term and concept often said to have been coined by sociologist Steven Vertovec in a 2007 article in ''Ethnic and Racial Studies'',&lt;ref name=Vertovec&gt;{{cite journal|first=Steven|last=Vertovec|title=Super-diversity and its implications|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=30|issue=6|pages=1024-1054|year=2007|doi=10.1080/01419870701599465}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmg.mpg.de/departments/socio-cultural-diversity/research-focus/ |title=Research focus|publisher=Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity|date= |accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but which he first used in a [[BBC]] article in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4266102.stm |title=Opinion: Super-diversity revealed |publisher=BBC News |date= 20 September 2005 |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and usage==
The term superdiversity is used to refer to some current levels of population diversity that are significantly higher than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/superdiversity-institute/about/about-superdiversity.aspx |title=About superdiversity|publisher=University of Birmingham |date= |accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertovec argues superdiversity in Britain "is distinguished by a dynamic interplay of variables among an increased number of new, small and scattered, multiple-origin, transnationally connected, socio-economically differentiated and legally stratified immigrants who have arrived over the last decade".&lt;ref name=Vertovec/&gt; It denotes increased diversity not only between immigrant and ethnic minority groups, but also within them. It has also been called the "diversification of diversity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Recognise superdiversity in S'pore to overcome stereotyping|url=http://www.todayonline.com/daily-focus/education/recognise-superdiversity-spore-overcome-stereotyping|work=Today|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertovec gives the example of [[Somalis in the United Kingdom]], arguing that the Somali community includes British citizens, [[refugees]] and [[asylum seeker]]s, people granted [[exceptional leave to remain]], undocumented migrants, and [[secondary migrants]] from other European states.&lt;ref name=Vertovec/&gt; Parveen Akhtar, a sociologist at the [[University of Bradford]], argues that the UK is no longer characterized by diversity but by superdiversity: "Post-1945 you had large waves of immigration from fewer places in the world, largely from the former colonies. Now, since the 1980s, you’ve got smaller waves of immigration from a wider range of places".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How will 'super diversity' affect the future of British politics|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/oct/08/immigration-britains-changing-identity|work=The Guardian|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Nasar Meer, "Super-diversity has emerged both as a description of empirical phenomena (the proliferation of diversities) and as a normative claim that increased pluralism (both associated with migration as well as wider changes in our understanding of identity categories) requires social scientists and policy makers to develop approaches to register this".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Key Concepts in Race and Ethnicity|first=Nasar|last=Meer|year=2014|location=London|publisher=Sage|isbn=9780857028686|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fran Meissner and Steven Vertovec, writing in 2015, the concept of superdiversity has been the subject of "considerable attention" since Vertovec introduced it in 2005. They note that Vertovec's 2007 article in ''Ethnic and Racial Studies'' is the most [[Citation|cited]] article in the history of the journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Comparing super-diversity|first1=Fran|last1=Meissner|first2=Steven|last2=Vertovec|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=38|issue=4|pages=541–555|year=2015|doi=10.1080/01419870.2015.980295}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has started to influence the fields of [[sociolinguistics]] and [[linguistic anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mutsaers|first1=Paul|last2=Swanenberg|first2=Jos|title=Super-diversity at the margins? Youth language in North Brabant, The Netherlands|journal=Sociolinguistic Studies|year=2012|volume=6|issue=1|pages=65–89|doi=10.1558/sols.v6i1.65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some authors are critical of the concept of superdiversity. Sinfree B. Makoni argues that the concept "contains a powerful sense of social romanticism, creating an illusion of equality in a highly asymmetrical world, particularly in contexts characterized by a search for homogenization...I find it disconcerting, to say the least, to have an open celebration of diversity in societies marked by violent xenophobia, such as South Africa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Critique of Language, Languaging and Supervernacular|first=Sinfree B.|last=Makoni|journal=Muitas Vozes|volume=1|issue=2|pages=189-199|year=2012|doi=10.5212/MuitasVozes.v.1i2.0003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ana Deumert argues:  “The use of ‘superdiverse’ as a descriptive adjective, is a theoretical cul-de-sac, because the complexities brought about by diversity in the social world ultimately defy numerical measurement” &lt;ref&gt; Deumert, A. (2014) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/22116958/4/supp/C Digital superdiversity: A commentary. Discourse, Context, and Media,4-5, 116-120].&lt;/ref&gt;
The claims of increased migrations and diversity have been challenged by Czajka and de Haas (2014). They observe that while globally the number of migrants has increased so has the world population so the ''proportion'' of  migrants has actually decreased . In the Americas migration has increased but diversity hasn't. The fact that migrations have centered on a “shrinking pool of prime destination countries”  (many of them small countries in Western Europe) led them to conclude that “the idea that immigration has become more diverse may partly reveal a Eurocentric worldview”&lt;ref&gt;Czajka, M. &amp; de Haas (2014) [http://iussp.org/sites/default/files/event_call_for_papers/The%20Globalization%20of%20Migration_extended%20abstract.pdf The globalization of migration: Has the world become more migratory]? International Migration Review, 48, 2, 283-323.&lt;/ref&gt;
Aneta Pavlenko argues that superdiversity is an exercise in academic branding  which  fails as an academic term:&lt;ref&gt;Pavlenko, A (2016) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292157452_Superdiversity_and_why_it_isn't_Reflections_on_terminological_innovations_and_academic_branding Superdiversity and why it isn't: Reflections on terminological innovations and academic branding] &lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=The uptake of the slippery slogan is not surprising. The aesthetic appeal of truthiness and the illusion of novelty, contemporaneity and relevance undoubtedly explain some of the attraction yet we cannot ignore the fact that the advent of superdiversity provided scholars of multilingualism with a new means to move up the academic ladder, distinguish their publications, and fund their work.}}

==Researchers and research institutes==
Key researchers working on superdiversity include Vertovec, [[Jan Blommaert]] and Jenny Phillimore. The University of Birmingham established the Institute for Research into Superdiversity in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elkes |first=Neil |url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/news/local-news/superdiversity-represents-real-opportunity-birmingham-4311557 |title=Superdiversity represents real opportunity for Birmingham |work=Birmingham Post |date=14 June 2013|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity]] in [[Göttingen]] is also an important centre for superdiversity research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://interlandaston.wordpress.com/2014/11/17/exploring-superdiversity-at-the-max-planck-institute/ |title=Exploring Superdiversity at the Max Planck Institute|website=Interland at Aston University|publisher=Aston University|date=17 November 2014|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand's "Superdiversity Stocktake: Impact on Business, Government and on New Zealand" was launched in November 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/73871314/New-Zealand-needs-to-adapt-to-diversity|title=New Zealand needs to adapt to diversity|publisher=Stuff.co.nz|date=10 November 2015|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sponsored by banks, companies, the [[Human Rights Commission (New Zealand)|Human Rights Commission]], and the [[Ministry of Education (New Zealand)|Ministry of Education]]. A study on "Implications of Superdiversity for NZ’s Electoral Laws and Democracy" was also launched. Both projects were carried out by the Superdiversity Centre for Law, Policy and Business, which describes itself as "a multidisciplinary centre specialising in analysing the law, policy and business implications of New Zealand’s superdiversity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superdiversity Stocktake to launch|url=http://www.immigration.govt.nz/employers/retain/settlementactionz/sept2015/superdiversitystocktake.htm|publisher=Immigration New Zealand|accessdate=2 November 2015|date=1 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202070431/http://www.immigration.govt.nz/employers/retain/settlementactionz/sept2015/superdiversitystocktake.htm|archivedate=2 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superdiversity Centre for Law, Policy and Business|url=http://www.chenpalmer.com/superdiversity/|publisher=Chen Palmer|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its patron is Sir [[Anand Satyanand]] and its chair is [[Mai Chen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Personnel|url=http://www.chenpalmer.com/superdiversity/key-personnel/|publisher=Chen Palmer|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In applied mathematics, '''Wahba's problem''', first posed by [[Grace Wahba]] in 1965, seeks to find a [[rotation matrix]] ([[Orthogonal matrix|special orthogonal matrix]]) between two coordinate systems from a set of (weighted) vector observations. Solutions to Wahba's problem are often used in [[satellite]] [[Flight dynamics (aircraft)|attitude determination]] utilising sensors such as [[magnetometer]]s and multi-antenna [[Global Positioning System|GPS receivers]]. The cost function that Wahba's problem seeks to minimise is as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;J(\mathbf{R}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^{N} a_k\| \mathbf{w}_k - \mathbf{R} \mathbf{v}_k \|^2 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;N\geq2 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}_k&lt;/math&gt; is the ''k''-th 3-vector measurement in the reference frame, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_k&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding ''k''-th 3-vector measurement in the body frame and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a 3 by 3 rotation matrix between the coordinate frames.&lt;ref&gt;The rotation &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; in the problem's definition transforms the body frame to the reference frame. Most publications define rotation in the reverse direction, i.e. from the reference to the body frame which amounts to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^T&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;math&gt;a_k&lt;/math&gt; is an optional set of weights for each observation.

A number of solutions to the problem have appeared in literature, notably Davenport's q-method, QUEST and [[singular value decomposition]]-based methods.  This is an alternative formulation of the [[Orthogonal Procrustes problem]] (consider all the vectors multiplied by the square-roots of the corresponding weights as columns of two matrices with ''N'' columns to obtain the alternative formulation).

Several methods for solving Wahba's problem are discussed by Markley and Mortari.

== Solution by Singular Value Decomposition ==

One solution can be found using a [[singular value decomposition]] as reported by [http://www.control.auc.dk/~tb/best/aug23-Bak-svdalg.pdf Markley]

1. Obtain a matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \mathbf{w}_i {\mathbf{v}_i}^T&lt;/math&gt;

2. Find the [[singular value decomposition]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{U} \mathbf{S} \mathbf{V}^T&lt;/math&gt;

3. The rotation matrix is simply:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{U} \mathbf{M} \mathbf{V}^T&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M} = \operatorname{diag}(\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; \det(\mathbf{U}) \det(\mathbf{V})\end{bmatrix})&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4829">The '''Wieringerrandmeer''' or '''bordering lake of Wieringen''' is a project of the Dutch province of [[North Holland]] and the (former) municipalities of [[Wieringen]] and [[Wieringermeer]]. (Since 2012 both are part of the new municipality of [[Hollands Kroon]].) It is intended to create islands and a [[bordering lakes|bordering lake]]. The project was cancelled in 2010 by the provincial and national governments.&lt;!--according to info below--&gt;

==History==
[[Wieringen]] has been connected to the mainland since 1932. 24. This land is used, among other things, for housing and agriculture. In the mid-90s, Wieringen initiated a project to restore its insular character by creating a [[bordering lakes|bordering lake]] between North Holland and the polder [[Wieringermeer]]. The authorities of North Holland agreed.

The Wieringerrandmeer was to be part of an ensemble including the [[Amstelmeer]], the [[IJsselmeer]] and the [[Wadden Sea]]. The province of North Holland and others united in support of Wieringerrandmeer. It was intended to "boost economic and social development" by stimulating business and creating a recreational lake. The project's slogan was "the Experience of the lake."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.rtvnh.nl/nieuws/49957/Plan+Wieringerrandmeer+niet+gepresenteerd|title= Plan Wieringerrandmeer niet gepresenteerd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
In 2003, the province of North Holland, the various municipalities, and the [[Water board (Netherlands)|Water Board of the Netherlands]] published a contest for a development project for the region. Five consortia attended. The winner Wirense consists of Volker Wessels and [[Royal Boskalis Westminster|Boskalis]], which  could participate in the project and take joint responsibility. The governments and the selected consortium drafted a Memorandum of Understanding for cooperation. On March 5, 2007, the public-private partnership (PPP) between the government (provincial and municipal) and operators (Boskalis, Volker Wessels) for the construction of Wieringerrandmeer ended. Subsequently, the planning and preparations will be processed in more detail. On [[2007 in the Netherlands|December 19th, 2007]], the executive of [[North Holland]] approved the project.

The project was approved by the Steering Committee Wieringerrandmeer: the province, municipalities, and Wirense group. The National Forest areas and the water board will be involved.

==Planning==
According to the original schedule, the physical construction was scheduled to begin in summer 2010. It was expected to create the lake in five years, but the work could last until around 2030, when all the objectives would be met.

==Nature==
With the construction of Wieringerrandmeer, continuity could be established between the [[IJsselmeer]] and [[Amstelmeer]] as far as forests, water bodies and reedbeds are concerned. This continuity of natural parts of the provincial ecological structure, was called the ''Northern Arc''.

==Facts==
The total area of 1600 ha is planned, including 250 ha for housing. 
The total surface area of water is about 860 ha. 
The total area of over 400 hectares of new nature. 
128 ha of forest plantations with new surrounding residential areas.

==Opposition and alternatives==
Not everyone was enthusiastic about the project Wieringerrandmeer. Thirty farms in Wieringen and Wieringermeer would be closed. Farmers would often forced to move away. Municipalities and counties said that future of agriculture in this region was uncertain, but farmers were skeptical of that assessment. The project would alter the region's water balance and likely have an adverse effect on agricultural land.

One June 27, 2008 ''The other Wieringerrandmeer'' presented an alternative plan developed among residents and farmers who were part of environmental organizations. They proposed reducing the area to be flooded, building fewer homes that would be located closer to the lake, and requiring fewer farms to relocate. Some luxury items, such as the creation of the Zuiderhaven lock between the Amstelmeer and the IJsselmeer, were removed from the project. Discussions concluded that it is not necessary to build a large lake on the edge of North-Holland.

==The final decision==
On November 3, 2010 the [[Gedeputeerde staten]] of [[North Holland]] canceled the project for financial reasons; on November 15 the [[States-Provincial]] of the [[Netherlands]] confirmed the decision.

The '''Wildenstein Institute''' is a French art institute that publishes [[Catalogue raisonné|catalogues raisonnés]] and scholarly inventories.  

==History==
The Institute was founded in 1970 by [[Daniel Wildenstein]] as the ''Fondation Wildenstein'', and it was renamed the Wildenstein Institute in 1990. It is an offshoot of the art dealing company ([[Wildenstein &amp; Co.]]) owned by the Wildenstein family for five generations.

It houses the historic documents and photographic archives assembled by Nathan Wildenstein (the company founder) and his son [[Georges Wildenstein|Georges]], which have been added to by subsequent generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.christies.com/special_sites/wildenstein/printer.asp?page=3|title=The Wildenstein Institute|publisher=Christies|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Wildenstein established the [[Wildenstein Index Number]] used by the Institute to identify paintings.

It publishes catalogues raisonnés and scholarly inventories of impressionists such as Monet, and other modern artists such as Gauguin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/qatar-buying-art-dealer-wildenstein8217s-manhattan-headquarters-1391049030?tesla=y|title=Qatar Buying Art Dealer Wildenstein's Manhattan Headquarters|last=Maloney|first=Jennifer|date=29 January 2014|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It describes itself as a center for research in art history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildenstein-institute.fr/spip.php?page=accueil&amp;lang=en Institute web site]&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently headed by [[Guy Wildenstein]].

==Controversy==
The Institute publishes a Monet catalogue raisonné and is regarded as the "official" authenticator of Monet paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tom-flynn.blogspot.com/2011/07/exclusive-more-on-monet-rejected-by.html|title=More on the Monet rejected by the Wildenstein Institute|last=Flynn|first=Tom|date=8 July 2011|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acceptance of a Monet by the Institute significantly increases the commercial value of a painting. The Institute controversially refused to authenticate ''[[Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil]]'' after an investigation by [[Fiona Bruce]] (a journalist) and [[Philip Mould]] (an art dealer and historian) in the BBC television programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'', which first aired on 19 June 2011.&lt;ref name="FoF"&gt;{{Cite episode

In 2011, a police raid discovered and seized 30 paintings valued at tens of millions of pounds from the Institute's Paris headquarters (see: [[Guy Wildenstein#Criticism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/8301627/Artworks-worth-millions-seized-from-Wildenstein-Institute.html|title=Artworks worth millions seized from Wildenstein Institute|last=Samuel|first=Henry|date=2 February 2011|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
