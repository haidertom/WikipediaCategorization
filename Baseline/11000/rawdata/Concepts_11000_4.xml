{{Italic title}}'''''Actus Essendi'''''  is a [[Latin]] expression coined by [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274). Translated as "act of being", the expression ''actus essendi'' refers to a fundamental metaphysical principle discovered by Aquinas in his Christianizing of [[Aristotle]]. 

Aquinas saw that in any subsisting extramental thing one finds a couplet of [[metaphysical]] principles: one is the ‘essence’ which makes the thing to be what it is, the other is the ''actus essendi'' which gives to the thing and to its ‘essence’ actual existence. 

The observation that individual things display instantiations of a particular ‘essence’ led Aquinas to postulate that what gives actual existence to a thing and to its ‘essence’ — the ''actus essendi'' — is unique, in the sense that the perfection of ''actus essendi'' cannot be said to be common in the way an ‘essence’ is said to be common. 

Things instantiating the essence of horseness, for example, are said to be similar because of their horseness. The essence of horseness is what makes horses to be the same under a common category.

But things instantiating the perfection of ''actus essendi'', are said to be different on account of their ''actus essendi''. The possession of ''actus essendi'' is what makes things unique and distinct from all other things. 

Thus in what actually exists as a subsisting extramental thing, there is an ‘essence’ which makes the thing to be what it is (a horse, for example), and the ''actus essendi'' which makes the thing to be a real, individual, existing thing.

Aristotle didn’t have the notion of ''actus essendi''. In fact, the contribution of Aquinas to the philosophy of being is precisely this, that he discovered that all Aristotelian acts were in reality ‘potency’ with respect to the ''actus essendi''. 

Aquinas saw that the metaphysical principle of ''actus essendi'' is the "act of all acts, the perfection of all perfections",&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Quaestiones Disputatae De Potentia'', question 7, article 2, ad 9.  See also ''Summa Theologiae'', part I, question 4, article 1, ad 3; and ''Summa Contra Gentiles'', book II, chapter 54, no. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and "a proper effect of God".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Contra Gentiles'', book III, chapter 66, no. 4. See also ''Summa Theologiae'', part I, question 45, article 5, corpus.&lt;/ref&gt; The metaphysics of Aristotle did not reach that far.

Accordingly, Pope John Paul II stresses in his teachings that the philosophy of Aquinas is the philosophy of ''actus essendi'', "whose transcendental value paves the most direct way to rise to the knowledge of subsisting Being and pure Act, namely to God."&lt;ref&gt;Pope John Paul II, "The ''Angelicum'' Address", speech delivered at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] in Rome on 17 November 1979. The original, in Italian, was published in ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' 71 (1979): 1472-1483. English translations are available in ''L'Osservatore Romano English Weekly Edition'' (17 December 1979): 6-8; and in ''Angelicum'' 57 (1980): 133-146.&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas defined God as the ‘''Ipse Actus Essendi subsistens''’, subsisting act of being.

The '''Alhambra Decree''' (also known as the '''Edict of Expulsion'''; [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Decreto de la Alhambra, Edicto de Granada'') was an edict issued on 31 March 1492, by the joint [[Catholic Monarchs]] of [[Spain]] ([[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]) ordering the expulsion of practicing [[Jews]] from the [[Kingdom of Castile|Kingdoms of Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] and its territories and possessions by 31 July of that year.&lt;ref name="Decree-translation"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sephardicstudies.org/decree.html|title=The Edict of Expulsion of the Jews - 1492 Spain|website=www.sephardicstudies.org|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary purpose was to eliminate their influence on Spain's large ''[[converso]]'' population and ensure they did not revert to Judaism. Over half of Spain's Jews had converted as a result of the religious persecution and pogroms which occurred in 1391.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez|2012|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to continuing attacks around 50,000 more had converted by 1415.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jews of Spain: A History of the Sephardic Experience|last=Gerber|first=Jane|publisher=The Free Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0029115749|location=New York|pages=1-144}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further number of those remaining chose to convert to avoid expulsion. As a result of the Alhambra decree and persecution in prior years, over 200,000 Jews converted to Catholicism and between 40,000 and 100,000 were expelled, an indeterminate number returning to Spain in the years following the expulsion.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/History_of_a_Tragedy.html?id=GKYlN1ySFOYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=History of a Tragedy: The Expulsion of the Jews from Spain|last=Pérez|first=Joseph|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2007|isbn=9780252031410|location=|pages=|language=en|translator-last=Hochroth|translator-first=Lysa|author-link=Joseph Pérez}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:17&lt;/sup&gt;

The edict was formally and symbolically revoked on 16 December 1968,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1968/12/17/archives/1492-ban-on-jews-is-voided-by-spain-1492-ban-on-jews-is-voided-in.html "1492 Ban on Jews Is Voided by Spain"], ''The New York Times'', Dec. 17, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; following the [[Second Vatican Council]]. This was a full century after Jews had been openly practicing their religion in Spain and synagogues were once more legal places of worship under Spain's Laws of Religious Freedom.

In 1924, the regime of Primo de Rivera granted Spanish citizenship to the entire Sephardic Jewish diaspora. In 2014, the government of Spain passed a law allowing [[dual citizenship]] to Jewish descendants who apply, to "compensate for shameful events in the country's past."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/sephardic-jews-eager-to-apply-for-spanish-citizenship/2014/02/17/e56978dc-9810-11e3-ae45-458927ccedb6_story.html "Sephardic Jews eager to apply for Spanish citizenship"], ''Washington Post'', Feb. 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[Sephardi Jews]] who can prove they are the descendants of those Jews expelled from Spain because of  the Alhambra Decree can "become Spaniards without leaving home or giving up their present nationality."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21596963-offer-right-past-wrong-may-not-lead-huge-influx-people-1492-and-all "1492 and all that"], ''The Economist'', Feb. 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/opinion/repatriating-spains-jews.html|title=Repatriating Spain’s Jews|last=Stavans|first=Ilan|date=2014-04-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|History of the Jews in Spain}}

By the end of the 8th century, [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Muslim]] forces had conquered and settled most of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Under Islamic law, the [[Jews]] who had lived in the region since at least [[Roman Empire|Roman times]], were considered "[[People of the Book]]," which was a protected status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The ornament of the world: How Muslims, Jews, and Christians created a culture of tolerance in medieval Spain|last=Menocal|first=María Rosa|date=|publisher=Back Bay Books|year=2012|isbn=9780316168717|edition=Reprint|location=|pages=|oclc=183353253|author-link=María Rosa Menocal|orig-year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the repressive policies of the Visigothic kingdom, who, starting in the sixth-century had enacted a series of anti-Jewish statutes which culminated in their forced conversion and enslavement, the tolerance of the Muslim Moorish rulers of ''[[al-Andalus]]'' allowed Jewish communities to thrive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Jewish merchants were able to trade freely across the Islamic world, which allowed them to flourish, and made Jewish enclaves in Muslim Iberian cities great centers of learning and commerce.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This led to a flowering of Jewish culture, as Jewish scholars were able to gain favor in Muslim courts as skilled physicians, diplomats, translators, and poets.  Although Jews never enjoyed equal status to Muslims, in some [[Taifa|Taifas]], such as [[Taifa of Granada|Granada]], Jewish men were appointed to very high offices, including Grand Vizier.&lt;ref&gt;http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/ha-nagid.asp&lt;/ref&gt; However, Muslim forces did not control the entire peninsula.

The ''[[Reconquista]]'', or the gradual reconquest of Muslim Iberia by the [[Christian]] kingdoms in the North, was driven by a powerful religious motivation: to reclaim Iberia for [[Christendom]] following the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] centuries before. By the 14th century, most of the Iberian Peninsula (present-day Spain and [[Portugal]]) had been reconquered by the Christian kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of León|León]], [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]].

During the Christian re-conquest, the Muslim kingdoms in Spain became less welcoming to the ''[[dhimmi]]''. In the late twelfth century, the Muslims in al-Andalus invited the fanatical [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] dynasty from North Africa to push the Christians back to the North.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After they gained control of the Iberian Peninsula, the Almohads offered the Sephardim a choice between expulsion, conversion, and death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many Jewish people fled to other parts of the Muslim world, and also to the Christian kingdoms, which initially welcomed them. In Christian Spain, Jews functioned as courtiers, government officials, merchants, and moneylenders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, the Jewish community was both useful to the ruling classes and to an extent protected by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Faith of the Fallen Jews: Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi and the Writing of Jewish History (The Tauber Institute Series for the Study of European Jewry)|publisher=Brandeis University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1611684872|editor-last=Kaye|editor-first=Alexander|location=Massachusetts|pages=252-253|editor-last2=Meyers|editor-first2=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; The erosion of rights the Sephardim had enjoyed under the Muslims, in Christian territories was slow and in some areas barely perceptible.

As the [[Reconquista]] drew to a close, overt hostility against Jews in Christian Spain became more pronounced, finding expression in brutal episodes of violence and oppression. In the early fourteenth century, the Christian kings vied to prove their piety by allowing the clergy to subject the Jewish population to forced sermons and disputations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; More deadly attacks came later in the century from mobs of angry Catholics, led by popular preachers, who would storm into the Jewish quarter, destroy synagogues, and break into houses, forcing the inhabitants to choose between conversion and death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thousands of Jews sought to escape these attacks by converting to Christianity.These Jewish converts were commonly called ''[[converso]]s'', [[New Christian]]s, or ''[[marrano]]s''; the latter two terms were used as insults. At first these conversions seemed an effective solution to the cultural conflict: many ''converso'' families met with social and commercial success.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; But eventually their success made these new Catholics unpopular with their neighbors, including some of the clergy of the [[Catholic Church|Church]] and Spanish aristocrats competing with them for influence over the royal families. By the mid-fifteenth century, the demands of the Old Christians, that the Catholic Church and the monarchy differentiate them from the conversos, led to the first ''[[Limpieza de sangre|Limpieza de Sangre]]'' laws, which restricted opportunities for converts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

These suspicions on the part of Christians were only heightened by the fact that some of the coerced conversions were undoubtedly insincere. Some, but not all, ''conversos'' had understandably chosen to salvage their social and commercial positions or their lives by the only option open to them – baptism and embrace of Christianity – while privately adhering to their Jewish practice and faith. Recently converted families who continued to intermarry were especially viewed with suspicion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These secret practitioners are commonly referred to as [[crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]] or ''marranos''.

The existence of crypto-Jews was a provocation for secular and [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] leaders who were already hostile toward Spain's Jewry. For their part, the Jewish community viewed conversos with compassion, because Jewish law held that conversion under threat of violence was not necessarily legitimate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although the Catholic Church was also officially opposed to forced conversion, under ecclesiastical law all baptisms were lawful, and once baptized, converts were not allowed to rejoin their former religion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The uncertainty over the sincerity of Jewish converts added fuel to the fire of [[antisemitism]] in 15th century Spain.

===European context===
{{Main|History of the Jews in Europe}}
[[File:Expulsion judios-en.svg|thumb|right|300px|Expulsions of Jews in Europe from 1100 to 1600]]

From the 13th to the 16th centuries European countries expelled the Jews from their territory on at least 15 occasions. Before the Spanish expulsion, the Jews were expelled from England in 1290 and multiple times from France between 1182 and 1354. The French case is typical of most expulsions, because whether they were local or national, the Jews were usually invited back a few years later.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alienated Minority: The Jews of Medieval Latin Europe|last=Stow|first=Kenneth|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0674015937|location=Massachusetts|pages=181-308}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews were also expelled from some of the German states. The Spanish expulsion was succeeded by at least five more expulsions, from other European countries.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7065-1327-4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Anti-Semitism: Israel Pocket Library|last=|first=|publisher=Keter Books|year=1974|isbn=9780706513271|volume=12|location=Jerusalem, IS|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Teacher's"&gt;{{cite web |title=Map of Jewish expulsions and resettlement areas in Europe |url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/gallery/expuls.htm |work=A Teacher's Guide to the Holocaust  |publisher=Florida Center for Instructional Technology, College of Education, University of South Florida |access-date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the expulsion of the Jews from Spain was both the largest of its kind, and officially the longest in Western European history.

Over the four hundred year period the majority of these decrees were implemented, the meaning of the expulsions gradually changed. At first, the expulsions of the Jews, or lack thereof, were exercises of kingly prerogative. Jewish communities in Europe were often protected by and associated with European monarchs in the Middle Ages, because under the feudal system, the Jews were often the monarch’s only reliable tax base.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Furthermore, the Jews had the reputation of moneylenders because they were the only group allowed to loan money at a profit under the prevailing interpretation of the [[Vulgate|Vulgate (Latin; official for Catholics) Bible]], which forbid Christians from collecting interest.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Therefore, the Jews were the creditors of the merchants, the aristocrats, and even the monarchs. Most expulsions were centered on this issue: the monarch would tax the Jewish community heavily, forcing them to call in loans, and then expel them. At the time of expulsion, the monarch would seize their remaining valuable assets, including the debts owed by the aristocrats and the merchants.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Therefore, expulsion of the Jews from Spain was unique not only in scale, but in its ideological motivations.

===Ferdinand and Isabella===
{{Main|Catholic Monarchs}}

Hostility towards the Jews in Spain was brought to a climax during the reign of the “Catholic Monarchs,” [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]]. Their marriage in 1469, which formed a [[personal union]] of the crowns of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], with coordinated policies between their distinct kingdoms, eventually led to the final unification of Spain.

Although their initial policies towards the Jews were protective, Ferdinand and Isabella were disturbed by reports claiming that most Jewish converts to Christianity were insincere in their conversion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As mentioned above, some accusations that [[Converso|''conversos'']] continued to practice Judaism in secret (see [[Crypto-Judaism]]) were true, but the “Old” Christians exaggerated the scale of the problem. More serious were the accusations that the Jews were trying to draw conversos back into the Jewish fold. In 1478, Ferdinand and Isabella made a formal application to [[Holy See|Rome]] to set up an Inquisition in Castile to investigate these and other suspicions. In 1487, King Ferdinand promoted the establishment of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] Tribunals in Castile.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In Aragon, it had been first instituted in 13th century to combat the Albigense heresy. However, the focus of this new Inquisition was to find and punish ''conversos'' who were practicing Judaism in secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0DoY6VKNSC0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Imperial Spain 1469-1716|last=Huxtable|first=Elliott John|publisher=Penguin|year=2002|isbn=9780141925578|location=London, UK|pages=|oclc=759581255|orig-year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These issues came to a head during Ferdinand and Isabella’s final conquest of Granada. The independent Islamic [[Emirate of Granada]] had been a [[tributary state]] to Castile since 1238. Jews and conversos played an important role during this campaign, because they had the ability to raise money and acquire weapons through their extensive trade networks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This perceived increase in Jewish influence further infuriated the Old Christians and the hostile elements of the clergy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, in 1491 in preparation for an imminent transition to Castilian territory, the [[Treaty of Granada (1491)|Treaty of Granada]] was signed by Emir [[Muhammad XII of Granada|Muhammad XII]] and the Queen of Castile, protecting the religious freedom of the Muslims there. By 1492, Ferdinand and Isabella had won the [[Battle of Granada]] and completed the Catholic [[Reconquista]] of the Iberian Peninsula from Islamic [[Al-Andalus|forces]]. However, the Jewish population emerged from the campaign more hated by the populace and less useful to the monarchs.

==Decree==
[[File:Alhambra Decree.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A signed copy of the Edict of Expulsion]]
The king and queen issued the Alhambra Decree less than three months after the surrender of Granada. Although Isabella was the force behind the decision, her husband Fernando did not oppose it, and both proved skillful at exploiting the hopes of the desperate Jewish population for monetary gain.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}  That her [[confessor]] had just changed from the tolerant [[Hernando de Talavera]] to the very intolerant [[Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros]] suggests an increase in royal hostility towards the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.co.il/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://users.ipfw.edu/jehle/deisenbe/Other_Hispanic_Topics/Cisneros_y_la_quema_de_los_manuscritos_granadinos.htm&amp;prev=search|title=Cisneros y la quema de los manuscritos granadinos|last=Eisenberg|first=Daniel|date=|year=1993|website=|publisher=Journal of Hispanic Philology|pages=107–124|trans-title=Cisneros and the Burning of the Grenadinian Manuscripts|orig-year=1992|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=27 June 2017|volume=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most powerful proponent of the decision however, was Torquemada, the priest in charge of the Spanish Inquisition.{{cn|date=August 2018}} The text of the decree accused the Jews of trying "to subvert the holy Catholic faith” by attempting to "draw faithful Christians away from their beliefs."&lt;ref name="Decree-translation" /&gt; These measures were [[Edward I of England#Finances.2C Parliament and the expulsion of Jews|not new in Europe]].

After the decree was passed, Spain's entire Jewish population was given only four months to either convert to Christianity or leave the country. The edict promised the Jews' royal "protection and security" for the effective three-month window before the deadline. They were permitted to take their belongings with them, excluding “gold or silver or minted money or other things prohibited by the laws of our kingdoms."&lt;ref name="Decree-translation"/&gt; In practice, however, the Jews had to sell anything they could not carry: their land, their houses, and their libraries, and converting their wealth to a more portable form proved difficult. The market in Spain was saturated with these goods, which meant the prices were artificially lowered for the months before the deadline. As a result, much of the wealth of the Jewish community remained in Spain. The punishment for any Jew who did not convert or leave by the deadline was [[summary execution]].&lt;ref name="Decree-translation" /&gt;

===Dispersal===
The Sephardic Jews migrated to four major areas: North Africa, the Ottoman Empire, Portugal, and Italy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some [[Sephardi Jews|Spanish Jews]] who emigrated to avoid conversion [[Jewish diaspora|dispersed]]  throughout the region of North Africa known as the [[Maghreb]]. The Jewish scholars and physicians among previous Sephardic immigrants to this area had reinvigorated the Jewish communities in North Africa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, in the 1490s, parts of the Mediterranean world, including Morocco were experiencing severe famine. As a result, a number of cities in Morocco refused to let the Spanish Jews in. This led to mass starvation among the refugees, and made the Jewish refugees vulnerable to the predation of slavers, although the regional ruler invalidated many of these sales within a few years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A good number of the Jews who had fled to North Africa returned to Spain and got converted. The Jews who stayed in North Africa often intermingled with the already existing [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]] Arabic or Berber speaking communities, becoming the ancestors of the Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian and Libyan Jewish communities.

Many Spanish Jews also fled to the [[Ottoman Empire]], where they were given refuge. Sultan [[Bayezid II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], learning about the expulsion of Jews from Spain, dispatched the [[Ottoman Navy]] to bring the Jews safely to Ottoman lands, mainly to the cities of [[Thessaloniki]] (currently in [[Greece]]) and [[İzmir]] (currently in [[Turkey]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Turkey.html "Turkey"], ''Jewish Virtual Library''&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these Jews also settled in other parts of the Balkans ruled by the Ottomans such as the areas that are now Bulgaria, Serbia and Bosnia. Concerning this incident, Bayezid II is alleged to have commented, "those who say that Ferdinand and Isabella are wise are indeed fools; for he gives me, his enemy, his national treasure, the Jews."

A majority of Sephardim migrated to [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], where they gained [[Expulsion of the Jews from Portugal|only a few years of respite from persecution]]. About 600 Jewish families were allowed to stay in Portugal following an exorbitant bribe, until the Portuguese king entered negotiations to marry the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella. Caught between his desire for an alliance with Spain and his economic reliance on the Jews, Manuel I declared the Jewish community in Portugal (perhaps then some 10% of that country's population)&lt;ref&gt;Kayserling, Meyer. "História dos Judeus em Portugal". Editora Pioneira, São Paulo, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Christians by royal decree unless they left the country. In return, he promised the Inquisition would not come to Portugal for 40 years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He then seized the Jews who tried to leave and had them forcibly baptized, after separating them from their children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was years before the Jews who fled to Portugal were allowed to emigrate. When the ban was lifted, many of them fled to the Low Countries, or the Netherlands. 

Throughout history, scholars have given widely differing numbers of Jews expelled from Spain. However, the figure is likely to be below the 100,000 Jews who had not yet converted to Christianity by 1492, possibly as low as 40,000. Such figures exclude the significant number of Jews who returned to Spain due to the hostile reception they received in their countries of refuge, notably [[Fez]] (Morocco). The situation of returnees was legalized with the Ordinance of the 10 of November 1492 which established that civil and church authorities should be witness to baptism and, in the case that they were baptized before arrival, proof and witnesses of baptism were required. Furthermore, all property could be recovered by returnees at the same price at which it was sold. Similarly the Provision of the Royal Council of 24 of October 1493 set harsh sanctions for those who slandered these New Christians with insulting terms such as ''tornadizos''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:115&lt;/sup&gt; After all, the Catholic monarchs were concerned with the souls of their subjects, and Catholic doctrine held that the persecution of converts would remove an important incentive for conversion. Returnees are documented as late as 1499.

===Conversions===
A majority of Spain's Jewish population had converted to Christianity during the waves of religious persecutions prior to the Decree—a total of 200,000 converts according to Joseph Pérez.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The main objective of the expulsion of practicing Jews was  ensuring the sincerity of the conversions of such a large convert population. Of the 100,000 Jews that remained true to their faith by 1492, an additional number chose to convert and join the converso community rather than face expulsion. Recent conversos were subject to additional suspicion by the Inquisition, which had been established to persecute religious heretics, but in Spain and Portugal was focused on finding crypto-Jews. Although Judaism was not considered a heresy, professing Christianity while engaging in Jewish practices was heretical. Additionally, ''Limpieza de Sangre'' statutes instituted legal discrimination against converso descendants, barring them from certain positions and forbidding them from immigrating to the Americas. For years, families with urban origins who had extensive trade connections, and people who were learned and multilingual were suspected of having Jewish ancestry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to the prejudice of the time, a person with Jewish blood was untrustworthy and inferior.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Such measures slowly faded away as converso identity was forgotten and this community merged into Spain's dominant Catholic culture. This process lasted until the eighteenth century, with a few exceptions, most notably the [[Chuetas]] of the island of [[Majorca]], where discrimination lasted into early 20th Century.

A [[Y chromosome]] [[DNA testing|DNA test]] conducted by the [[University of Leicester]] and the [[Pompeu Fabra University]] has indicated an average of nearly 20% for Spaniards having some direct patrilineal descent from populations from the Near East which colonized the region either in historical times, such as [[Jews]] and [[Phoenicians]], or during earlier prehistoric [[Neolithic]] migrations. Between the 90,000 Jews who converted under the Visigoth persecutions, and the 100,000+ Jews who converted in the years leading up to expulsion, it is likely that many of these people have Jewish ancestry. On the other hand, genetic studies have dispelled local beliefs in the American South West that Spanish Americans are the descendants of conversos.&lt;ref name="FloresMaca-Meyer2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Flores |first1=Carlos |last2=Maca-Meyer |first2=Nicole |last3=González |first3=Ana M |last4=Oefner |first4=Peter J |last5=Shen |first5=Peidong |last6=Pérez |first6=Jose A |last7=Rojas |first7=Antonio |last8=Larruga |first8=Jose M |last9=Underhill |first9=Peter A |title=Reduced genetic structure of the Iberian peninsula revealed by Y-chromosome analysis: implications for population demography |journal=European Journal of Human Genetics |volume=12 |issue=10 |year=2004 |pages=855–863 |issn=1018-4813 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201225 |pmid=15280900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12627534 | doi=10.1002/ajpa.10168 | volume=120 | issue=4 | title=Mitochondrial DNA affinities at the Atlantic fringe of Europe |date=April 2003 | journal=Am.

==Modern Spanish policy==
The Spanish government has actively pursued a policy of reconciliation with the descendants of its expelled Jews. In 1924, the regime of Primo de Rivera granted Spanish citizenship to the entire Sephardic Jewish diaspora. As stated above, the Alhambra decree was officially revoked in 1968, after the Second Vatican Council rejected the charge of deicide traditionally attributed to the Jews. In 1992, in a ceremony marking the 500th anniversary of the Edict of Expulsion, [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos]] (wearing a [[Kippah|yarmulke]]) prayed alongside Israeli president [[Chaim Herzog]] and members of the Jewish community in the [[Beth Yaacov Synagogue (Madrid, Spain)|Beth Yaacov Synagogue]]. The King said, "[[Sepharad|Sefarad]] (the Hebrew name for Spain) isn't a nostalgic memory anymore; it is a place where it must not be said that Jews should simply 'feel' at home there, for indeed Hispano-Jews are at home in Spain...What matters is not accountability for what we may have done wrong or right, but the willingness to look to the future, and analyze the past in light of our future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elpais.com/diario/1992/04/01/espana/702079221_850215.html |title=El Rey celebra en la sinagoga de Madrid "el encuentro con los judíos españoles" |last=Cembrero |first=Ignacio |date=1 April 1992 |access-date=9 September 2016 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The King celebrates the "meeting with Spanish Jews" in the Madrid synagogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From November 2012 Sephardi Jews have had the right to automatic Spanish nationality without the requirement of residence in Spain. Prior to November 2012, Sephardi Jews already had the right to obtain Spanish citizenship after a reduced residency period of two years (versus ten years for foreigners but natural from Philippines, Equatorial Guinea, Brazil and about other 20 American republics than also require 2 years.) While their citizenship is being processed, Sephardi Jews are entitled to the consular protection of the Kingdom of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/23/world/europe/spain-citizenship-process-eased-for-sephardic-jews.html |title=Spain: Citizenship Process Eased for Sephardic Jews |last=Minder |first=Raphael |publisher=The New York Times |date=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes Spain unique among European nations as the only nation that currently grants automatic citizenship to the descendants of Jews expelled during the [[Expulsion of Jews from Spain|European medieval evictions]]. Although these measures are popular in the Jewish community, they have also sparked some controversy. A minority of thinkers hold that these policies represent less the abnegation of prejudice as a shift to [[Philo-Semitism|philo-semitism]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As of November 2015, 4300 Sephardi Jews have benefited from this law and acquired Spanish citizenship, swearing allegiance to the Spanish Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2015/11/30/actualidad/1448887588_869275.html |title=El Rey, a los sefardíes: "¡Cuánto os hemos echado de menos!" |publisher=El País |date=30 November 2015 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The King, the Sephardim, "How I've missed you!"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the number of Jews in Spain was estimated to range between 40,000 and 50,000 people.

An '''asylum seeker''' (also rarely called an '''asylee''') is a person who flees his or her home country, enters another country and applies for [[right of asylum|asylum]], i.e. the right to international protection, in this other country. An asylum seeker may be a [[refugee]], a [[displaced person]], but not a migrant, such as an [[economic migrant]].  Migrants are not asylum seekers. A person becomes an asylum seeker by making a formal application for the right to remain in another country and keeps that status until the application has been concluded. The relevant immigration authorities of the country of asylum determine whether the asylum seeker will be granted protection and becomes an officially recognised refugee or whether asylum is refused and the person becomes an [[illegal immigrant]] who has to leave the country again and may even be [[deportation|deported]]. The asylum seeker may be recognised as a refugee and given [[Refugee#Refugee status|refugee status]] if the person's circumstances fall into the definition of "'''refugee'''" according to the 
[[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Refugee Convention]] or other [[refugee law]]s, such as the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] – if asylum is claimed within the European Union. However signatories to the refugee convention create their own policies for assessing the protection status of asylum seekers, and the proportion of asylum applicants who are rejected varies from country to country and year to year.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The terms asylum seeker and refugee are often confused: an asylum-seeker is someone who says he or she is a refugee, but whose claim has not yet been definitively evaluated. On average, about 1 million people seek asylum on an individual basis every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49c3646c137.html |title=Asylum-Seekers |website=Unhcr.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Non-governmental organizations concerned with refugees and asylum seekers have pointed out difficulties for [[displaced person]]s to seek asylum in industrialized countries. As their [[immigration policy]] often focuses on the fight of [[illegal immigration]] and the strengthening of border controls it deters displaced persons from entering territory in which they could lodge an asylum claim. The lack of opportunities to legally access the asylum procedures can force asylum seekers to undertake often expensive and hazardous attempts at [[illegal entry]].

In recent years, the public as well as policy makers of many countries are focussing more and more on refugees arriving through [[third country resettlement]] and pay less and less attention to asylum seekers and those who have already been granted refugee status but did not come through resettlement. Asylum seekers may be even referred to as "queue jumpers", because they did not wait for their chance to be resettled&lt;ref&gt;Resettlement: where’s the evidence, what’s
the strategy?, Alexander Betts, Forced Migration Review 54, January 2017, page 73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Making an application== 
Some countries offer "asylum visas" which are a safe and legal way to reach the country where asylum will be claimed. Many countries don't offer that, which is why many people take large risks for entering these countries. In many countries asylum can only be claimed on arrival in the country:
* When seeking admission at a port of entry (air- or seaports) when they first arrive, i.e. before passing through immigration control.
* In-country applicants apply for asylum onshore after passing through immigration control. Some [[government]]s are tolerant and accepting of onshore asylum claims; other governments [[arrest]] or [[immigration detention|detain]] those who attempt to seek asylum; sometimes while processing their claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2014/08/15/Fundamentals_of_Immigration_Law.pdf |format=PDF |title=Fundamentals of Immigration Law |author=Charles A. Wiegand, III |website=Justice.gov |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* After making an [[unauthorized arrival]] and bypassing immigration control.
* After making a legal entry but then having lost the right to stay or remain, such as after having overstayed a Visa.
* As a response to being detained or apprehended by immigration enforcement.

==Different types of asylum and protection==
Asylum as an institution is not restricted to the category of individuals who qualify for refugee status. Rather on the contrary, this institution predates the birth of the international regime for the protection of refugees.

===Convention refugee status===

As at 1 July 2013, there were 145 parties to the [[1951 Refugee Convention]] and 146 to the [[1967 Protocol]]. These states are bound by an obligation under international law to grant asylum to people who fall within the definition of Convention and Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;María-Teresa Gil-Bazo, 2006: Refugee status, subsidiary protection,and the right to be granted asylum under EC law; Research Paper No. 136, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; The refugee definitions of 1951 and 1967 are the strictest and most exclusive and persons who fall within this definition are called Convention refugees and their status is called Convention refugee status. Persons who do not fall within this definition may still be granted complementary forms of protection, if they fall within other refugee definitions.

The practical determination of whether a person is a refugee or not is most often left to certain [[Government agency|government agencies]] within the host country. In some countries the refugee status determination (RSD) is done by the UNHCR. The burden of substantiating an asylum claim lies with the claimant, who must establish that they qualify for protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/397778/ASSESSING_CREDIBILITY_AND_REFUGEE_STATUS_V9_0.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 31, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312090850/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/397778/ASSESSING_CREDIBILITY_AND_REFUGEE_STATUS_V9_0.pdf |archivedate=March 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/Eng/BoaCom/references/LegJur/Pages/Credib.aspx |title=Assessment of Credibility in Claims for Refugee Protection - Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada |publisher=Irb-cisr.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, Country of Origin information is used by migration officials as part of the assessment of asylum claims, and governments commission research into the accuracy of their country reports. Some countries have studied the rejection rates of their migration officials making decisions, finding that individuals reject more applicants than others assessing similar cases - and migration officials are required to standardise the reasons for accepting or rejecting claims, so that the decision of one adjudicator is consistent with what their colleagues decide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/22-refugee-law/improving-consistency-decision-making |title=Improving consistency in decision-making |publisher=ALRC |date= 2011-12-19|accessdate=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complementary forms of protection===

The refugee definition of the 1951 Convention is universally binding, but there are many other [[Refugee#Legal definition|definitions]] according to which protection may be offered to people who do not fall within this definition.

====Subsidiary protection status====
[[Subsidiary protection]] is an international protection for persons seeking asylum, but do not qualify as refugees. It is an option to get asylum for those who do not have a well founded fear of persecution (which is required for refugee status according to the 1951 Convention), but do indeed have a substantial risk to be subjected to torture or to a serious harm if they are returned to their country of origin, for reasons that include war, violence, conflict and massive violations of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;María-Teresa Gil-Bazo, 2006: Refugee status, subsidiary protection,
and the right to be granted asylum under EC law; Research Paper No. 136, page 10&lt;/ref&gt; The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and European Union law have a broader definition of who is entitled to asylum.

====Temporary protection visa====
[[Temporary protection visa]]s are used to persons in Australia who applied for refugee status after making an unauthorised arrival. It is the main type of visa issued to refugees when released from Australian immigration detention facilities and they are required to reapply for it every three years.

==Status determination processes==
{{see|Refugee#Refugee status determination|Refugee law#Refugee status determination}}
===Group determination===
Asylum seekers may be given refugee status on a group basis. Refugees who went thought the group status determination are also referred to as [[prima facie]] refugees. This is done in situations when the reasons for seeking refugee status are generally well known and individual assessment would otherwise overwhelm the capacities of assessors. Group determination is more readily done in states that not only have accepted the refugee definition of the 1951 Convention, but also use a refugee definition that includes people fleeing indiscriminate or generalized violence, which are not covered in the 1951 Convention.&lt;ref name ="UN11"&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/46f7c0ee2.pdf UNHCR Resettlement Handbook, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 2011, page 19]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual assessment===
For persons who do not come into the country as part of a bigger group individual asylum interviews are conducted to establish whether the person has sufficient reasons for seeking asylum.

===Appeals===
In many countries, asylum applicants can challenge a rejection by challenging the decision in a court or migration review panel. In the United Kingdom, more than one in four decisions to refuse an asylum seeker protection are overturned by immigration judges.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Jan [http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jan-shaw/asylum-appeals_b_3107750.html "Will the UK Continue to Have One in Four Refused Asylum Cases Overturned on Appeal?"], ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', 18 April 2013. Retrieved 20 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights of asylum seekers==
Whilst waiting for a decision asylum seekers have limited rights in the country of asylum. In most countries they are not allowed to work and in some countries not even to volunteer. In some countries they are not allowed to move freely within the country. Even access to health care is limited. In the European Union, those who have yet to be granted official status as [[refugee]]s and are still within the asylum process have some restricted rights to healthcare access.&lt;ref name = "tone2"&gt;{{ cite journal| author = Schneider, C., S. Joos, and K. Bozorgmehr |year = 2015 |title= Disparities in health and access to healthcare between asylum seekers and residents in Germany: a population-based cross-sectional feasibility study| journal= BMJ Open |volume = 5 |issue = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes access to medical and psychological care.&lt;ref name = "tone2"/&gt; However, these may vary depending on the host country.  For instance, under the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act in Germany, asylum seekers are outside primary care and are limited to emergency health care, vaccinations, pregnancy and childbirth with limitations on specialty care.&lt;ref name = "tone2"/&gt;  Asylum seekers have greater chance of experiencing unmet health needs as compared to the general German population. They also have greater odds of hospital admissions and at least one visit to a psychotherapists relative to the German general population.

==Destitution==
Because asylum seekers often have to wait for months or years for the results of their asylum applications and because they are usually not allowed to work and only receive minimal or no financial support destitution is a considerable risk.

Asylum seekers usually get some kind of support from governments whilst their application is processed. However, in some countries this support ends immediately once they are given refugee status. But the fact that they were given refugee status does not mean that they were already given all the documents they need for starting their new lives. Because of these circumstances, some refugees are forced to sleep rough and beg for money or, if they’re lucky, rely on the generosity of charities and friends for food and shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/latest/news/4076_new_refugees_face_homelessness_and_destitution |title=New refugees face homelessness and destitution |website=Refugeecouncil.org.uk |date=2014-05-07 |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refusal of asylum==
It often happens that the country neither recognizes the [[Refugee#Refugee status|refugee status]] of the asylum seekers nor sees them as legitimate migrants and thus treats them as [[Alien (law)|illegal aliens]]. If an asylum claim has been rejected, the asylum seeker is said to be refused asylum, and called a failed asylum seeker. Some failed asylum seekers are allowed to remain temporarily, some [[voluntary return|return home voluntarily]] home and some are forcibly returned. The latter are most often placed in [[immigration detention]] before being deported.

===Right to remain temporarily===
Even though asylum wasn't granted the applicant may be given the right to remain temporarily. In the UK refused cases may be granted humanitarian protection (usually for 5 years) or discretionary leave to remain.

===Deportation===
{{main|Deportation}}

Refugees cannot be deported or otherwise forced to go back to their country of origin as this would be [[refoulement]], which is against international law. But in many cases failed asylum seekers, i.e. who failed to be considered as refugees, are equally vulnerable and may face significant risks when going back, voluntarily or not.

If asylum seekers have serious medical problems or it is not safe for them to return to their country of origin it is against international law to deport them. However, sometimes they are deported even though they face risks there and it is not safe for them to return. UK authorities have been accused of paying insufficient attention to medical evidence of torture in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38017463 Torture evidence ignored by Home Office, says charity]&lt;/ref&gt;

Deportees may be separated from their families who can temporarily or permanently continue to remain in the country; younger persons may not have been to their country of origin for most of their lives, may not even be able to speak the language, don't know anyone and have no connection whatsoever with that country, apart from the formality of having been born there; they may be traumatised through experiences made in detention; they may be detained again as soon as they enter their country of origin; they may even be persecuted. For example, many failed asylum seekers who were returned to Congo (DRC) in 2011 were imprisoned, tortured, forced to pay a ransom, raped or subjected to sexual harassment after their return.&lt;ref&gt;Post-deportation risks for failed asylum seekers, Jill Alpes, Forced Migration Review 54, page 77&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exclusion from protection==
Asylum seekers who have committed crimes against peace, a war crime or a crime against humanity, or other serious non-political crimes, or whose actions are contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations, are excluded from international protection.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook on European law relating to asylum, borders and immigration, 2014, page 83&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bureau of Silly Ideas Lbg''' (BOSI) is a not-for-profit [[conceptual art]] organisation that produces shows and interactive installations; operating predominantly in public spaces. Initially founded in October 2002 by Roger Hartley and Claire Horan, registered&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04556803|title=BUREAU OF SILLY IDEAS LIMITED - Overview (free company information from Companies House)|website=beta.companieshouse.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Companies House]]'''.''' In 2016 they further expanded to become a [[Community interest company|CIC Trust Organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10059715|title=BUREAU OF SILLY IDEAS TRUST COMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANY - Overview (free company information from Companies House)|website=beta.companieshouse.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau of Silly Ideas is funded by [[Arts Council England]] and headquartered in [[Brixton]], London.

The majority of their work is in collaboration with local government councils across the United Kingdom, in addition to commissions from a variety of heritage sites and festivals across the world. They are also members of National Association of Street Artists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nasauk.org/list-of-members/|title=List of Members|work=NASA UK|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Independent Street Arts Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isanuk.org/profile/bureau-of-silly-ideas/|title=ISAN {{!}} Bureau Of Silly Ideas|website=www.isanuk.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were the first company to combine circus performance under the veil of construction work - transforming everyday objects into unassuming props or using radio controlled robotics.

== History ==

=== Early Conception ===

The Bureau of Silly Ideas was founded in October 2002 by Roger Hartley, an artist who was predominantly interested in performance in public spaces. He was interested by the fictitious transformation of everyday objects and what he saw, as their ability to unequivocally connect with individuals. This was inspired by a show in 1997 that Roger began to work on with Simon Collins to create a show based on Don Quixote with life size fire breathing robot horses and radio controlled wheelie bins. Roger had early experience in transforming spaces as he invented and launched ‘Lost Vagueness’ a pop up working casino and Cabaret with strict dress code that would appear in places not used to dress code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://miraculoustheatre.com/performers-with-miraculous-theatre-company|title=the company - Miraculous Theatre Company|work=Miraculous Theatre Company|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger and BOSI continue to infiltrate festivals but with interactive art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bureau of Silly ideas|title=Barry The Portalloo @ Glastonbury 2011|date=2011-07-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21LNIGhhdY|accessdate=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger was approached by Arts Council England to present ideas for street circus, theater and carnival; which has recently been accepted as forms of Art by the council. His proposition was performances that juxtaposed circus and funfair against construction sites and roadworks, which involved transforming these everyday objects and activities. His purpose was to engage people with their communities development in a fun and memorable way, in order to change their perception of something they may have otherwise found frustrating.

Roger received funding from Arts Council England and created the Bureau of Silly Ideas and the company's first show ‘The Hole Job’.

=== Development Years ===

In 2008 The Bureau of Silly Ideas produced a show called ‘Big Oriental Squid Inc’ (BOSI) which was also an officially registered subsidiary company. The styling of performance names using the same acronym ‘BOSI’ has become a hallmark of their work. This show demonstrated an important artistic shift from concentrating on everyday objects to everyday companies. Pushing and exploring legal boundaries and exploring the public's reaction to fictitious but official companies. They were the first to use a cross-media approach for the narrative of a public art event, 2008 – Burst Pipe Dream in Brighton. Utilizing social media, fake news and company Big Oriental Squid Inc to provoke public backlash before unveiling the entire show as fictitious and for fun and then engaged them in the final performance. Subtly hitting multiple politically fused subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bureau of Silly ideas|title=Bureau Of Silly Ideas_The Burst Pipe Dream|date=2010-05-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJs5WFj-Lxo|accessdate=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== At Present ===

In 2016 Roger Hartley and BOSI worked as first resident artist for [[Shakespeare Birthplace Trust]]. Which culminated in the creation of the United Nations Board of Significant Inspiration (UNBOSI) and the ‘Garden of Curious Amusement’ in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visitstratforduponavon.co.uk/event/birthplace-trust-garden-of-curious-a-muse-ments|title=BIRTHPLACE TRUST//Garden of Curious A-MUSE-ments|website=www.visitstratforduponavon.co.uk|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"BOSI were an inspirational partner to work with, engaging in a really constructive dialogue with the SBT on exciting and unique project ideas, and then delivering a successful activity that met with excellent customer feedback from audience members who were both surprised and delighted with their experience.” Dr Delia Garratt (Director of Cultural Engagement SBT)&lt;/blockquote&gt;The UNBOSI project is continuing and has recently partnered with CPP Marketplace&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cppmarketplace.co.uk/n-h-home/market-place-pleased-announce-new-partnership-un-bosi/|title=Market Place is pleased to announce new partnership with the UN BOSI - Market Place - The Place to Be|date=2018-04-09|work=Market Place - The Place to Be|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; to conduct shows across the East Anglia area of the UK.

== Philosophy ==
The Bureau of Silly Ideas was founded in 2002 by Roger Hartley, who wanted to address the issue of fracturing communities within an increasingly connected and globalized world. The fundamental belief of the company is that the creation of, and access to, art is a pathway out of urban poverty traps. The method of exacting this belief was through Conceptual and Process Art performances; that transposed the 'everyday' into surprising and immersive experiences "taking a magnifier to [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp]] urinal and extrapolating its essence, to a much greater scale" - Roger Hartley. The aim was to combat the loss of community involvement by creating shows that stripped back community development, such as construction and attempt to change the perception of them from interference to interactive; therefore bonding a community more closely with its refurbishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=Roger Hartley at TEDxLondon - City 2.0|date=2014-01-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichtrU7UCOM|accessdate=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shows ==

=== The Burst Pipe Dream ===
The Burst Pipe Dream was a 7-day installation that took place in 2008 at Brighton's Jubilee Square, under the guise of a subsidiary company called 'Big Oriental Squid Inc'. The purpose of the event is described by BOSI as&lt;blockquote&gt;The story that [[Brighton]] would be welcoming Europe’s first Giant Squid Farm in newly developed, Jubilee Square. Created with two core aims in mind, the primary being community cohesion - the building of Jubilee Square had overrun and as such caused a discourse in the relationship between construction, public space and community. The second was to respond to the overfishing of our oceans by highlighting the role of corporations, who put profit before the planet. Since its' conception in 2008, BOSinc has visited various towns. The Burst Pipe Dream is currently being redeveloped for a national seaside town tour in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bureauofsillyideas.com/the-big-work/|title=The Big Work – Bureau of Silly Ideas|website=www.bureauofsillyideas.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Bureau of Silly Ideas collaborated with Brighton Festival for the event. The event attracted attention from the general public and local news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bureau of Silly ideas|title=Bureau Of Silly Ideas_The Burst Pipe Dream|date=2010-05-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJs5WFj-Lxo|accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] term ''cathexis'' (κάθεξις) was chosen by [[James Strachey]] to render the [[German language|German]] term ''Besetzung'' in his translation of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s complete works. Freud himself wrote of "interest (Besetzung)", in an early letter to [[Ernest Jones]].&lt;ref name= Gay465n&gt;{{cite book|last=Gay|first=Peter|title=Freud|year=1989|page=465n}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Gay]] objected that Strachey's use of cathexis was an unnecessarily esoteric replacement for Freud's use of ''Besetzung'' – "a word from common German speech rich in suggestive meanings, among them 'occupation' (by troops) and 'charge' (of [[Electric charge|electricity]])".&lt;ref name= Gay465n/&gt;

==Usage==

Freud defined cathexis as an investment of [[libido]], pointing out for example how dream thoughts were cathected with different amounts of [[Affect (psychology)|affect]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 2) p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; A cathexis or emotional charge might be positive or negative, leading some of his followers to speak as well of a cathexis of [[mortido]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, '' A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (1976) p. 54 and p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Freud called a group of cathected ideas a [[Complex (psychology)|complex]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Five Lectures on Psycho-Analysis'' (1995) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud frequently described the functioning of psychosexual energies in quasi-physical terms,&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=June 2013}} representing frustration of libidinal desires, for example, as a blockage of (cathected) energies which would eventually build up and require release in alternative ways. This release could occur, for example, by way of [[Regression (psychology)|regression]] and the "re-cathecting" of former positions or [[fixation (psychology)|fixation]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'', pp. 123–4&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[autoeroticism|autoerotic]] enjoyment (in phantasy) of former sexual objects: "object-cathexes".

Freud used the term "[[anticathexis|anti-cathexis]]" or counter-charge&lt;ref&gt;Felluga, Dino. "Terms Used by Psychoanalysis." Introductory Guide to Critical Theory. Purdue U. 31 August 2009. ([http://www.purdue.edu/guidetotheory/psychoanalysis/psychterms.html online])&lt;/ref&gt; to describe how the [[Ego, super-ego, and id|ego]] blocks such regressive efforts to discharge one's cathexis: that is, when the ego wishes to [[psychological repression|repress]] such [[Interpersonal attraction|desires]]. Like a steam engine, the libido's cathexis then builds up until it finds alternative outlets, which can lead to [[sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]], [[reaction formation]], or the construction of (sometimes disabling) symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'' p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

[[M. Scott Peck#Love|M. Scott Peck]] distinguishes between love and cathexis, with cathexis being the initial in-love phase of a relationship, and love being the ongoing commitment of care.

==Object relations==

Freud saw the early cathexis of objects with libidinal energy as a central aspect of human development.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'' p. 118 and pp. 151–8&lt;/ref&gt; In describing the withdrawal of cathexes which accompanied the mourning process, Freud provided his major contribution to the  foundation of [[object relations theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Neville Symington]], ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (2003) p. x-xi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thinking==

Freud saw thinking as an experimental process involving minimal amounts of cathexis, “in the same way as a general shifts small figures about on a map”.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'' p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

In delusions, it was the hypercathexis (or over-charging) of ideas previously dismissed as odd or eccentric which he saw as causing the subsequent pathology.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==

[[Eric Berne]] raised the possibility that [[child art]] often represented the intensity of cathexis invested in an object, rather than its objective form.&lt;ref&gt;Berne, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics charge that the term provides a potentially misleading neurophysiological analogy, which might be applicable to the cathexis of ideas but certainly not of objects.&lt;ref&gt;J. Laplanche/J-B Pontalis, ''The Language of Psychoanalysis'' () p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Further ambiguity in Freud's usage emerges in the contrast between cathexis as a measurable load of (undifferentiated) libido, and as a qualitatively distinct type of affect – as in a "cathexis of longing".&lt;ref&gt;Laplanche, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Climate change mitigation]] scenarios''' are possible futures in which [[global warming]] is reduced by deliberate actions, such as a comprehensive switch to [[alternative energy|energy sources other than fossil fuels]].  A typical mitigation scenario is constructed by selecting a long-range target, such as a desired atmospheric concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and then fitting the actions to the target, for example by placing a cap on net global and national emissions of [[greenhouse gas]]es.

An increase of global temperature by more than 2{{nbsp}}[[°C]] has come to be the majority definition of what would constitute intolerably dangerous [[climate change]] with efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5{{nbsp}}°C above pre-industrial levels per the [[Paris Agreement]].   Some climate scientists are increasingly of the opinion that the goal should be a complete restoration of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]'s preindustrial condition, on the grounds that too protracted a [[Deviation (statistics)|deviation]] from those conditions will produce irreversible changes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

== Target levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ==

{{Importance section|reason=Target levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are a '''target''' of mitigation, not a "mitigation scenario" or related to one.|date=March 2012}}
Contributions to climate change, whether they cool or warm the [[Earth]], are often described in terms of the [[radiative forcing]] or imbalance they introduce to the planet's [[energy budget]]. Now and in the future, [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] carbon dioxide is believed to be the major component of this forcing, and the contribution of other components is often quantified in terms of "parts-per-million CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-equivalent" ([[Parts per million|ppm]] [[CO2e|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e]]), or the increment/decrement in carbon dioxide concentrations which would create a radiative forcing of the same magnitude.

At present, non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contributions to climate change, positive and negative, are believed to roughly cancel out, so that the net radiative forcing being experienced at present, expressed in ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-e, is more or less the same as the actual current level of carbon dioxide (406.75 ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as of December 2017). To some extent this legitimates the statement of targets just in terms of ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as is usually the case. However, the positive and negative non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will not necessarily balance in future, and so a target stated in terms of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e is less ambiguous.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

=== Stabilization wedges ===

A '''[[Climate stabilization wedge|stabilization wedge]]''' (or simply "wedge") is an action which incrementally reduces projected emissions. The name is derived from the triangular shape of the gap between reduced and unreduced emissions trajectories when graphed over time. For example, a reduction in electricity demand due to increased efficiency means that less electricity needs to be generated and thus fewer emissions need to be produced. The term originates in the [[Stabilization Wedge Game]]. As a reference unit, a stabilization wedge is equal to the following examples of mitigation initiatives: deployment of two million 1 MW [[Wind turbine|wind turbines]]; completely halting the [[deforestation]] and planting of 300 million hectares of trees; the increase in the average energy efficiency of all the world's buildings by 25 percent; or the installation of [[carbon capture and storage]] facilities in 800 large coal-fired power plants.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Complete Guide to Climate Change|last=Dawson|first=Brian|last2=Spannagle|first2=Matt|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=0415477891|location=Oxon|pages=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacala and Socolow proposed in their work, ''Stabilization Wedges'', that seven wedges are required to be delivered by 2050 - at current technologies - to make a significant impact on the mitigation of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pacala|first=S.|last2=Socolow|first2=R.|date=2004-08-13|title=Stabilization Wedges: Solving the Climate Problem for the Next 50 Years with Current Technologies|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/305/5686/968|journal=Science|language=en|volume=305|issue=5686|pages=968–972|doi=10.1126/science.1100103|issn=0036-8075|pmid=15310891}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, sources that estimate the need for 14 wedges because Pacala and Socolow's proposal would only stabilize carbon dioxide emissions at current levels but not the atmospheric concentration, which is increasing by more than 2 ppm/year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2011, Socolow revised their earlier estimate to nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thebulletin.org/2011/09/wedges-reaffirmed/|title=Wedges reaffirmed - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|last=Socolow|first=Robert|date=September 27, 2011|work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 350 ppm ===

A mitigation scenario modeled by Malte Meinshausen ''et al.'' suggested in 2006 that to stabilize CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 350 ppm, we would have needed to reduce emissions by slightly more than 5%  per year.&lt;ref name="multigas"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Meinshausen | first1 = M. | last2 = Hare | first2 = B. | last3 = Wigley | first3 = T.

From an "energy technology and policy perspective", [[Joe Romm]] says a 350-ppm target will require eight wedges, each saving 1 gigaton of carbon per year, by 2030, and another ten by 2060.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climateprogress.org/2008/11/23/an-open-letter-to-james-hansen-on-the-real-truth-about-stabilizing-at-350-ppm/|title=An open letter to James Hansen on the real truth about stabilizing at 350 ppm|author=|date=|website=climateprogress.org|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicholas Stern]] of the [[Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change]], called the  "world’s top climate economist", endorses 350 ppm as “a very sensible long-term target.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climateprogress.org/2009/09/09/nicholas-stern-worlds-top-climate-economist-endorses-350-ppm-long-term-target/|title=Nicholas Stern, world’s top climate economist, endorses 350 ppm as "a very sensible long-term target."|author=|date=|website=climateprogress.org|accessdate=12 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118134131/http://climateprogress.org/2009/09/09/nicholas-stern-worlds-top-climate-economist-endorses-350-ppm-long-term-target/|archive-date=2010-01-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 450 ppm ===

The BLUE scenarios in the IEA's [[Energy Technology Perspectives]] publication of 2008 describe pathways to a long-range concentration of 450 ppm. [[Joseph Romm]] has sketched how to achieve this target through the application of 14 wedges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://climateprogress.org/2008/04/22/is-450-ppm-or-less-politically-possible-part-2-the-solution/ Is 450 ppm (or less) politically possible? Part 2: The Solution]&lt;/ref&gt;

''World Energy Outlook 2008'', mentioned above, also describes a "450 Policy Scenario", in which extra energy investments to 2030 amount to [[United States dollar|$]]9.3 trillion over the Reference Scenario. The scenario also features, after 2020, the participation of major economies such as [[PRC|China]] and [[India]] in a global cap-and-trade scheme initially operating in [[OECD]] and [[European Union]] countries. Also the less conservative 450 ppm scenario calls for extensive deployment of [[negative carbon dioxide emission|negative emissions]], i.e. the removal of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere. According to the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) and OECD, "Achieving lower concentration targets (450 ppm) depends significantly on the use of [[BECCS]]".&lt;ref name=OECD&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 550 ppm ===

This is the target advocated (as an upper bound) in the [[Stern Review]]. As approximately a doubling of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels relative to [[industrial society|preindustrial]] times, it implies a temperature increase of about three degrees, according to conventional estimates of [[climate sensitivity]]. [[Mitigation of global warming#Pacala and Socolow|Pacala and Socolow]] list 15 "wedges", any 7 of which in combination should suffice to keep CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels below 550 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/305/5686/968|title=Stabilization Wedges: Solving the Climate Problem for the Next 50 Years with Current Technologies|first1=S.|last1=Pacala|first2=R.|last2=Socolow|date=13 August 2004|publisher=|journal=Science|volume=305|issue=5686|pages=968–972|accessdate=12 April 2018|via=www.sciencemag.org|doi=10.1126/science.1100103|pmid=15310891|bibcode=2004Sci...305..968P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Energy Agency]]'s [[World Energy Outlook]] report for 2008 describes a "Reference Scenario" for the world's energy future "which assumes no new government policies beyond those already adopted by mid-2008", and then a "550 Policy Scenario" in which further policies are adopted, a mixture of "[[cap-and-trade]] systems,  [[economic sector|sectoral]] agreements and national measures". In the Reference Scenario, between 2006 and 2030 the world invests $26.3 trillion in energy-supply infrastructure; in the 550 Policy Scenario, a further $4.1 trillion is spent in this period, mostly on [[efficient energy use|efficiency]] increases which deliver fuel cost savings of over $7 trillion.&lt;ref name="weo08"&gt;http://www.iea.org/weo/docs/weo2008/fact_sheets_08.pdf [[World Energy Outlook]] 2008 Fact Sheet&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenhouse gas concentrations are aggregated in terms of [[Carbon dioxide equivalent#Equivalent carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide equivalent]]. Some multi-gas mitigation scenarios have been modeled by Meinshausen ''et al.''&lt;ref name="multigas" /&gt;

=== As a short-term focus ===

In a 2000 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Global warming in the twenty-first century: An alternative scenario|first1=James|last1=Hansen|first2=Makiko|last2=Sato|first3=Reto|last3=Ruedy|first4=Andrew|last4=Lacis|first5=Valdar|last5=Oinas|date=29 August 2000|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=97|issue=18|pages=9875–9880|bibcode=2000PNAS...97.9875H|doi=10.1073/pnas.170278997|doi-access=free|pmc=27611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen argued that the 0.75{{nbsp}}°C{{failed verification|date=July 2016}} rise in average global temperatures over the last 100 years has been driven mainly by greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide, since warming due to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; had been offset by cooling due to [[aerosols]], implying the viability of a strategy initially based around reducing emissions of non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; greenhouse gases and of [[black carbon]], focusing on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; only in the longer run.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ucsusa.wsm.ga3.org/ssi/archive/ucs-review-for-alternative-scenario.html Review of Hansen et al.: Global Warming in the Twenty-First Century: An Alternative Scenario]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A determinancy diagram, sometimes known as a [[dependency diagram]], is a diagram which documents the [[determinancy]] or dependency between a set of data items.&lt;ref&gt;Beynon-Davies P. (2004). Database Systems 3rd Edition. Palgrave, Basingstoke, UK. {{ISBN|1-4039-1601-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determinancy diagrams are particularly used as an aid to [[database normalization]].

'''Dhātus''' (dhä·tōōs), n.pl. ( from [[Sanskrit]] धातु dhātu - layer, stratum, constituent part, ingredient, element, primitive matter&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit-English Dictionary by Monier-Williams, (c) 1899&lt;/ref&gt; ) in [[Ayurveda]], the seven fundamental principles (elements) that support the basic structure (and functioning) of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Jonas: Mosby's Dictionary of Complementary and Alternative Medicine. (c) 2005, Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

They consist of:
*Rasa dhatu ([[Lymph]])
*Rakta dhatu ([[Blood]])
*Mamsa dhatu ([[Muscles]])
*Medha dhatu ([[Fat]])
*Asthi dhatu ([[Bone]])
*Majja dhatu (marrow (bone and spinal))
*Shukra dhatu ([[Semen]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://ayurveda.iloveindia.com/ayurveda-fundamentals/dhatu-significance.html Seven Dhatus of Ayurveda]&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional texts often refer to the above as the Seven Dhātus (Saptadhātus). Ojas is known as the eighth Dhātu, or Mahādhātu (superior, or great dhātu).&lt;ref&gt;Dhātus http://www.ayurveda-recipes.com/dhatus.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27187">{{Tort law}}
A '''duty to rescue''' is a concept in [[tort law]] that arises in a number of cases, describing a circumstance in which a [[party (law)|party]] can be held liable for failing to come to the rescue of another party in who could face potential injury or death without being rescued.  In [[common law]] systems, it is rarely formalized in statutes which would bring the penalty of law down upon those who fail to rescue.  This does not necessarily obviate a moral [[duty]] to rescue: though law is binding and carries government-authorized sanctions and awarded civil penalties, there are also separate ethical arguments for a duty to rescue that may prevail even where law does not punish failure to rescue.

==Common law system==
In the [[common law]] of most [[English-speaking countries]], there is no general duty to come to the rescue of another.&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Myth of Moral Justice |last=Rosenbaum |first=Thane |year=2004 |publisher=HarperCollins |location= |isbn=978-0-06-018816-0 |pages=247–248 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jt2FMMu4JakC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;lpg=PA248&amp;dq=duty+to+rescue+spouse&amp;source=web&amp;ots=5QsbxTo_Fi&amp;sig=MpS0Ys_Wh1qXpgn24LewAKkjRtU&amp;hl=en#PPA248,M1 |accessdate=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, a person cannot be held liable for doing nothing while another person is in peril.&lt;ref&gt;See Yania v. Bigan 155 A.2d 343 (Penn. 1959). Bigan and Yania were [[Surface mining#Strip mining|strip mining]] [[Coal mining|coal]]. Bigan was working next to an 18' deep pit with water in it. He asked Yania and Ross to help him with a pump. Bigan and Ross told Yania to jump over the pit. He did, fell in, and drowned. Yania's widow had argued that Bigan and Ross had a legal obligation to assist Yania to prevent his drowning. However, the Appellate Court found that the law imposes no duty to rescue.[http://www.invispress.com/law/torts/yania.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.missouri.edu/peters/t2syllabus.html |title=Torts II syllabus |last=Peters |date=January 2001 |publisher=University of Missouri-Columbia school of Law |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121211145958/http://law.missouri.edu/peters/t2syllabus.html |archivedate=2012-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such a duty may arise in two situations:

* A duty to rescue arises where a person creates a hazardous situation. If another person then falls into peril because of this hazardous situation, the creator of the hazard{{spaced ndash}}who may not necessarily have been a negligent [[tortfeasor]]{{spaced ndash}}has a duty to rescue the individual in peril.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ethical Issues in the Law of Tort |last=Bayles |first=Michael |authorlink= |author2=Bruce Chapman |year=1983 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=New York |isbn=90-277-1639-0 |pages=20–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Such a duty may also arise where a "special relationship" exists. For example:
** Parents have a duty to rescue their [[Minor (law)|minor]] children. This duty also applies to those acting ''[[in loco parentis]]'', such as schools or babysitters.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://www.tvw.org/modules/opinions/767238_o.htm Aba Sheikh v. Choe], 156 Wn.2d 441, 457, 128 P.3d 574 (Wash. 2006), which discusses [[Restatements of the Law|Restatement (Second) of Torts]] sec. 315 and 319, stating: &lt;blockquote&gt;As a general rule, our common law imposes no duty to prevent a third person from causing physical injury to another... Additionally, under the public duty doctrine, the State is not liable for its negligent conduct even where a duty does exist unless the duty was owed to the injured person and not merely the public in general... However, this court recognizes an exception to both these general rules. [A] duty arises where 'a special relation exists between the actor and the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor to control the third person's conduct.'  [Therefore,] we have adopted one class of these 'special relation' cases as described in section 319:  "One who takes charge of a third person whom he knows or should know to be likely to cause bodily harm to others if not controlled is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to control the third person to prevent him from doing such harm."&lt;/blockquote&gt;(links added, citations removed)&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Common carriers]] have a duty to rescue their patrons.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''De Vera v. Long Beach Public Transportation Co.'' 180 Cal. App. 3d 782, 225 Cal. Rptr. 789&lt;/ref&gt;
** Employers have an obligation to rescue employees, under an implied contract theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2168&amp;context=wmlr] p425&lt;/ref&gt;
** In some U.S. jurisdictions, real property owners have a duty to rescue [[invitees]] but not trespassers from all reasonably foreseeable dangers on the property.  Other jurisdictions, such as California, extend the duty to rescue to all persons who enter upon real property regardless whether they are classified as invitees, social guests or trespassers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13675261667224866941&amp;q=rowland+v.+christian&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006&amp;as_vis=1 | title=Rowland v. Christian, 69 Cal. 2d 108 (1968) | accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Spouses have a duty to rescue each other in all U.S. jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Myth of Moral Justice |last=Rosenbaum |first=Thane |year=2004 |publisher=HarperCollins |location= |isbn=978-0-06-018816-0 |page=248 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** In the [[United States]], as of 2009 ten states had laws on the books requiring that people at least notify law enforcement of and/or seek aid for strangers in peril under certain conditions: [[California]],&lt;ref name="Duty to Rescue/Report Statutes."&gt;Volokh, Eugene.

Ann. § 940.34&lt;/ref&gt; These laws are also referred to as Good Samaritan laws, despite their difference from [[Good Samaritan law|laws of the same name]] that protect individuals who try to help another person.&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum" /&gt;  These laws are rarely applied, and are generally ignored by citizens and lawmakers.&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum" /&gt;

Where a duty to rescue arises, the rescuer must generally act with [[reasonable care]], and can be held liable for injuries caused by a reckless rescue attempt. However, many states have [[Good Samaritan law|limited or removed liability from rescuers]] in such circumstances, particularly where the rescuer is an emergency worker. Furthermore, the rescuers need not endanger themselves in conducting the rescue.

== Civil law system ==
Many [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, which are common in Continental Europe, Latin America and much of Africa, impose a far more extensive duty to rescue.&lt;ref name="Peters" /&gt;  The duty is usually limited to doing what is “reasonable”. In particular, a helper does not have to substantially endanger themselves.&lt;ref name="323cStGB"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p2779 |title=German Criminal Code, Section 323c Omission to effect an easy rescue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can mean that anyone who finds someone in need of medical help must take all reasonable steps to seek medical care and render best-effort first aid. Commonly, the situation arises on an event of a traffic accident: other drivers and passers-by must take an action to help the injured without regard to possible personal reasons not to help (e.g. having no time, being in a hurry) or ascertain that help has been requested from officials. {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} In practice however, almost all cases of compulsory rescue simply require the rescuer to alert the relevant entity (police, fire brigade, ambulance) with a phone call.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

==Regulations by country==
In some countries, there exists a legal requirement for citizens to assist people in distress, unless doing so would put themselves or others in harm's way. Citizens are often required to, at minimum, call the local [[emergency telephone number|emergency number]], unless doing so would be harmful, in which case the authorities should be contacted when the harmful situation has been removed. {{As of|2012}}, there were such laws in several countries, including&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum" /&gt; [[Albania]], [[Andorra]],&lt;ref&gt;articles 199, 278, 279, 310 of Andorran Criminal Code&lt;/ref&gt; [[Argentina]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monografias.com/trabajos52/penal-especial/penal-especial2.shtml Argentine Penal Code laws regarding crimes against the person] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Austria]],&lt;ref&gt;Austrian Criminal Code § 95 StGB&lt;/ref&gt; [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]],&lt;ref&gt;Croatian Criminal Code art. 123&lt;/ref&gt; [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/120052016002 Estonian Criminal Code] §124&lt;/ref&gt; [[Finland]], [[France]],&lt;ref&gt;French Criminal Code §63(2)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;German Criminal Code §323c&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greece]],&lt;ref&gt;Greek Criminal Code Article 288 paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hungary]], [[Iceland]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]],&lt;ref&gt;Polish Criminal Code §162&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portugal]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Tunisia]].

===Argentina===
Argentina has legislation on "abandonment of persons", Articles 106-108 of the [[Argentine Penal Code]], which includes the provision in Article 106 that "a person who endangers the life or health of another, either by putting a person in jeopardy or {{em|abandoning to their fate a person unable to cope alone who must be cared for}} ... will be imprisoned for between 2 and 6 years" [emphasis added].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monografias.com/trabajos52/penal-especial/penal-especial2.shtml Argentine Penal Code laws regarding crimes against the person] {{es icon}} Original of text translated in the article: "el que pusiere en peligro la vida o la salud de otro, sea colocándolo en situación de desamparo, sea abandonando a su suerte a una persona incapaz de valerse y a la que deba mantener o cuidar o a la que el mismo autor haya incapacitado, será reprimido con prisión de 2 a 6 años".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
In [[Quebec]], which makes use of civil law, there is a general duty to rescue in its [[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights]]: "Every human being whose life is in peril has a right to assistance...Every person must come to the aid of anyone whose life is in peril, either personally or calling for aid, by giving him the necessary and immediate physical assistance, unless it involves danger to himself or a third person, or he has another valid reason."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canlii.org/qc/legis/loi/c-12/20050513/tout.html Charte des droits et libertés de la personne, L.R.Q. c. C-12]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Criminal law in Canada]] is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government, so failure to comply with an article of the Charter in Quebec does not constitute a criminal offence except if by doing so a party also violates the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]].

Other provinces follow common law.

In Canadian air law, it is mandatory to make oneself and one's aircraft available to aid search-and-rescue efforts if the aircraft is in the immediate area and a distress signal is received. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

=== Denmark ===

Under the [[Danish penal code]], all persons must provide aid to the best of their ability to any person who appears to be lifeless or in mortal danger (§ 253), must alert authorities or take similar steps to prevent impending disasters that could cause loss of life (§ 185), must comply with all reasonable requests of assistance by a public authority when a person's life, health or well-being is at stake (§ 142), and must, if they learn of a planned crime against the state, human life or well-being, or significant public goods, do everything in their power to prevent or mitigate the crime, including but not limited to reporting it to authorities (§ 141), in all cases provided that acting would not incur particular danger or personal sacrifice.
Violations are punishable by up to three months (§ 142), two years (§ 185 and § 253) or three years (§ 141) in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== France ===
Anyone who fails to render assistance to a person in danger will be found liable before French Courts (civil and criminal liability). The penalty for this offence in criminal courts is imprisonment and a fine (under article 223–6 of the Criminal Code) while in civil courts judges will order payment of pecuniary compensation to the victims.&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Laur Liabilities of Doctors on Aircraft Med Leg J March 2013 81:31—35 http://mlj.rsmjournals.com/content/81/1/31.extract&lt;/ref&gt;

The photographers at the scene of [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|the fatal car collision of Diana, Princess of Wales]], were investigated for violation of the French law of "non-assistance à personne en danger" (failing to provide assistance to a person in danger), which can be punished by up to 5 years of imprisonment and a fine of up to €75,000.

=== Germany ===
In [[Germany]], ''unterlassene Hilfeleistung'' (failure to provide assistance) is a [[crime]] under section 323(c)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__323c.html&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Strafgesetzbuch|German Criminal Code]]: any citizen is obligated to provide assistance in case of an accident or general danger if necessary, and is normally&lt;!-- normally, as interpretation of the law is always up to the courts, and you know: two judges, three opinions... --&gt; immune from prosecution if assistance given in good faith and following the [[reasonable person]]'s (aka ordinary prudent person's) understanding of required measures turns out to be harmful.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__34.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__17.html&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the rescuer or responder may not be held liable if the action they should take in order to help is unacceptable for them and they are unable to act (for example when unable to act at the sight of blood). In Germany, knowledge of basic emergency measures and first aid and CPR certification is a prerequisite for the granting of a driving license.

=== Greece ===
In [[Greece]], a citizen is required by law to provide help to anyone who asks for it in case of a tragedy or public danger, as long as providing help does not endanger him or her personally. According to article 288 of the criminal code, not providing help in those cases can impose a prison sentence of up to 6 months.

=== Israel ===
In 1998, [[Israel]] enacted the “Stand-not-idly-by-thy-neighbor’s-blood Law”, taking its name from [[Leviticus 19|Leviticus 19:16]]. It requires one to render assistance whenever one is in the presence of a person who, due to some sudden occurrence, is in severe and immediate danger to life, limb or health, provided that one can do so without placing oneself or a third party in danger. Notifying the authorities (e.g. the police or fire department, as relevant) or calling on others who can render assistance for aid is considered “rendering assistance” under the law. A person obliged to render assistance who fails to do so can be fined.

=== Russia ===
In [[Russia]], Article 125 of the criminal code prohibits knowingly abandoning people who are in life- or health-threatening situations when said people can't help themselves. However it binds only those who are either legally obligated to care for said people or who themselves have put said people into life or health threatening situation. The maximum penalty is 1 year in prison.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zakonrf.info/uk/125/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Serbia ===
In [[Serbia]], a citizen is required by law to provide help to anyone in need (after for example a major car accident) as long as providing help does not endanger him or her personally. Serbian criminal code Articles 126 and 127 state that should one abandon a helpless person and/or not provide aid to a person in need, one could receive a prison sentence of up to one year. If the person dies of injuries due to no aid having been provided by the bystander, a sentence up to 8 years in prison can be imposed.

=== Spain ===
In [[Spain]], a citizen is required by law to '''provide or seek''' help to anyone in need as long as providing help does not endanger him or her personally. Not doing so is a criminal offence under Article 195 of the Spanish Criminal Code&lt;ref&gt;http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Penal/lo10-1995.l2t9.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethical justifications ==
Legal requirements for a duty to rescue do not pertain in all nations, states, or localities.  However, a moral or ethical duty to rescue may exist even where there is no legal duty to rescue.  There are a number of potential justifications for such a duty.

One sort of justification is general and applies regardless of role-related relationships (doctor to patient; firefighter to citizen, etc.).  Under this general justification, persons have a duty to rescue other persons in distress by virtue of their common humanity, regardless of the specific skills of the rescuer or the nature of the victim's distress.

These would justify cases of rescue and in fact make such rescue a duty even between strangers.  They explain why [[philosopher]] [[Peter Singer]] suggests that if one saw a child drowning and could intervene to save him, they should do so, if the cost is moderate to themselves. Damage to their clothing or shoes or how late it might make them for a meeting would be insufficient excuse to avoid assistance.  Singer goes on to say that one should also attempt to rescue distant strangers, not just nearby children, because globalization has made it possible to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer, "The Drowning Child and the Expanding Circle", ''New Internationalist'', April, 1997; http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/199704--.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Such general arguments for a duty to rescue also explain why after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], Haitians were digging family members, friends, and strangers out of the rubble with their bare hands and carrying injured persons to whatever medical care was available.&lt;ref&gt;David Gardner and Liz Hazelton, "Haiti earthquake: Bodies piled up on the streets as disaster leaves 'thousands' dead", ''The Guardian'', January 14, 2010, http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1242885/Haiti-earthquake-Victims-forced-dig-rubble-bare-hands-free-surivors.html&lt;/ref&gt;  They also explain why, while covering that same earthquake, journalist and physician Sanjay Gupta and a number of other MD-journalists began acting as physicians to treat injuries rather than remaining uninvolved in their journalistic roles. Similarly, they justify journalist Anderson Cooper's attempt to shepherd an injured young boy away from some "toughs" nearby in the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;David Folkenflik, "Reporters Who Are MDs Find Lines Blurred in Haiti", National Public Radio, January 20, 2010, https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122784322&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific arguments for such a duty to rescue include, but are not limited to:
* The [[Golden Rule]]: treat others as one would wish to be treated.  This assumes that all persons would wish to be rescued if they were in distress, and so they should in turn rescue those in distress to the best of their abilities. What counts as distress requiring rescue may, of course, differ from person to person, but being trapped or at risk of drowning are emergency situations which this position assumes all humans would wish to be rescued from.
* [[Utilitarianism]]: utilitarianism posits that those actions are right which best maximize happiness and reduce suffering ("maximize the good").&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill, ''Utilitarianism'' available from many publishers and on-line, first published in 1863&lt;/ref&gt;  Utilitarian reasoning generally supports acts of rescue which contribute to overall happiness and reduced suffering.  Rule utilitarianism would look not just at whether individual acts of rescue maximize the good, but whether certain types of acts do so. It then becomes one's duty to perform those types of actions. Generally, having strangers rescue those in distress maximizes good so long as the rescue attempt does not make things worse, so one has a duty to rescue to the best of her or his ability as long as doing so will not make things worse.
* Humanity: the rules of humanity advise that the essence of morality and right behavior is tending to human relationships. Therefore, [[virtues]] (desirable character traits) such as compassion, sympathy, honesty, and fidelity are to be admired and developed.&lt;ref&gt;page 19-20 in Tom L. Beauchamp, LeRoy Walters, Jeffrey P. Kahn, and Anna C. Mastroianni, ''Contemporary Issues in Bioethics, 7th edition'', Wadsworth: Belmont, CA, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Acting out of compassion and sympathy will often require rescue where someone is in need. Indeed, it would not be compassionate to ignore someone's need, though the way one fulfills that need may vary. In cases of emergency, rescue would be the most compassionate act compared with allowing a person to remain trapped in rubble.

There are also ethical justifications for role-specific or skill-specific duties of rescue such as those described above under the discussion of U.S. Common Law. Generally, these justifications are rooted in the idea that the ''best'' rescues, the most effective rescues, are done by those with special skills. Such persons, when available to rescue, are thus even more required to do so ethically than regular persons who might simply make things worse (for a utilitarian, rescue by a skilled professional in a relevant field would maximize the good even better than rescue by a regular stranger). This particular ethical argument makes sense when considering the ability firefighters to get both themselves and victims safely out of a burning building, or of health care personnel such as physicians, nurses, physician's assistants, and EMTs to provide medical rescue.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Williams, "Medical Samaritans: Is There A Duty To Treat?", ''Oxford Journal of Legal Studies'' 21(3): 393-413. 2001.  Williams argues that medical personnel have a duty of medical rescue even when there is no prior patient-provider relationship, as when a provider happens to pass an accident site with no EMTs to hand.&lt;/ref&gt;

These are some of the ethical justifications for a duty to rescue, and they may hold true for both regular citizens and skilled professionals even in the absence of legal requirements to render aid.

==Case law==
===United States===
In an 1898 case, Buch v. Amory Mfg. Co., 69 N.H. 257, 44 A. 809, 1897 N.H. LEXIS 49 (N.H. 1898), the [[New Hampshire Supreme Court]] unanimously held that after an eight-year-old boy negligently placed his hand in the defendant's machinery, the boy had no right to be rescued by the defendant. Beyond that, the trespassing boy could be held liable for damages to the defendant's machine.&lt;ref&gt;''Buch v. Amory Mfg. Co.'', 69 N. H. 257, 44 A. 809 (1898), p, 262., cited at [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9833.1995.tb00055.x/abstract ''An Argument Against a Legal Duty to Rescue'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1907 case [[People v. Beardsley]], Beardsley's mistress, Blanche Burns, passed out after overdosing on morphine. Rather than seek medical attention, Beardsley instead had a friend hide her in the basement, and Burns died a few hours later. Beardsley was tried and convicted of manslaughter for his negligence. However, his conviction was reversed by the Supreme Court of Michigan saying that Beardsley had no legal obligation to her.

===Germany===
In 2016, a 83-year-old man collapsed in a bank lobby in [[Essen]] and later died. Several customers stepped over him without providing assistance. With the help of security camera footage, these customers were identified and sentenced to fines of several thousand euros each for failing to provide assistance. A customer who phoned emergency services was not indicted, as he was considered to have provided sufficient assistance.&lt;ref name="spiegel-bank"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/rentner-in-bank-gericht-verhaengt-geldstrafen-wegen-unterlassener-hilfeleistung-a-1168518.html |title=Unterlassene Hilfeleistung für Rentner in Bank - Angeklagte müssen Geldstrafen zahlen  |date=2017-09-18 |language=de |trans-title=Failure to provide assistance to pensioner in bank - suspects must pay fines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Hart''' was an early settler of the American Colonies who, as town clerk, wrote the [[Flushing Remonstrance]], a precursor to the [[United States Constitution]]'s provision on [[freedom of religion]] in the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].&lt;ref name="Waller1899"/&gt;

==Early life==

Little is known with any degree of certainty regarding Edward Hart's life before 1640. Genealogical sources give place and date of birth, year and manner of emigration to North America, and first places of residence within the American colonies, but none provide documentary evidence for their assertions.{{refn|group=note|On this topic see also Andrews's ''Genealogical history of Deacon Stephen Hart and his descendants'' which says that Edmund Hart, probable brother of Stephen, was one of the first settlers of Dorchester, having lived there from 1632.&lt;ref name="Andrews1875"/&gt; Edward Hart is said to have moved from Dorchester to Weymouth, Massachusetts, in 1634 or 1636 and to Farmington, Connecticut, the following year, but this was also likely to have been Edmund. On Edward in Dorchester and Weymouth see Robertson's ''Profiles of the signers of the Flushing Remonstrance, December 27, 1657''&lt;ref name="Robertson1973"/&gt;{{rp|56}} and the ''Hart Memorial''.&lt;ref name="Andrews1875"/&gt;{{rp|56}} For the likelihood that Edmund is meant see Whittmore's ''Genealogical Guide to the Early Settlers of America'',&lt;ref name="Whittemore1898"/&gt; Pope's ''The pioneers of Massachusetts, a descriptive list, drawn from records of the colonies, towns and churches and other contemporaneous documents'',&lt;ref name="Pope1900"/&gt; Holmes's ''Directory of the ancestral heads of New England families, 1620-1700'',&lt;ref name="Holmes"/&gt; and the source used by Singleton: ''Genealogical history of Deacon Stephen Hart and his descendants, 1632. 1875: with an introduction of miscellaneous Harts and their progenitors, as far as known; to which is added a list of all the clergy of the name found, all the physicians, all the lawyers, the authors, and soldiers'' by Alfred Andrews (New Britain, Connecticut, Hart, Austin, 1875).}} A man named Edward Hart was one of the early settlers of Rhode Island having obtained a plot of land from [[Roger Williams]] and signed an agreement for the government of Providence in 1640.&lt;ref name="Bayles1891"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Staples1843"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Staples1843"/&gt; This man married a woman named Margaret whose surname is unknown.&lt;ref name="Austin1887"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Torrey1985"/&gt; There is no definite evidence that this Edward Hart is the same as the Edward Hart of Flushing, Long Island, but sources generally accept that he is.&lt;ref name="Robertson1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Torrey1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy1939"/&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name="Chapin1916"/&gt;

==Founding settler of Flushing==

Although there is some level of uncertainty about his prior whereabouts, there is no doubt that on October 10, 1645, Hart was one of 18 men who received a charter from the Dutch governor of [[New Netherland]], [[William Kieft]], to establish the town of Vlissingen (i.e., [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]]) in Long Island.&lt;ref name="Laws and ordinances of New Netherland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross1902"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|In addition to Edward Hart the charter establishing Flushing lists Thomas Applegate, Thomas Beddard, Lawrence Dutch, Robert Field, Thomas Farrington, Robert Firman, John Hicks, [[John Lawrence (New York)|John Lawrence]], William Lawrence, John Marston, Michael Millard, William Pidgeon, Thomas Stiles, Thomas Saul, Henry Sawtelle, [[John Townsend (Norwich)|John Townsend]], and William Thorn.&lt;ref name="Laws and ordinances of New Netherland"/&gt;}} Three of these men came to Flushing from Rhode Island and may have known Hart there. The others, so far as is known, came from Massachusetts, Connecticut, or other towns in Long Island.{{refn|group=note|Applegate, Field, and Hicks came to Flushing from Rhode Island; Stiles from Connecticut, the Lawrences and Thorn from Long Island, and the rest from Massachusetts so far as is known.}}

In 1642, after efforts to attract Dutch immigrants had disappointing results, the administration in New Netherland and its parent governors in Amsterdam began to accept applications from English settlers to form towns on Long Island.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|38–39, 41–42, et. seq.}}&lt;ref name="McKinley1900"/&gt; These settlers brought with them the forms of government common in the settlements of New England. Based on practices common in English towns, these were generally more liberal than the ones granted to New Netherland's Dutch communities&lt;ref name="McKinley1900"/&gt;{{rp|12, 18}} and the charter granted to the applicants from Flushing was no exception.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|15–16}}&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1910"/&gt;{{rp|161–162}}{{refn|group=note|In granting unusual privileges to settlers from New England the administration in New Amsterdam expected to gain revenue from taxes, manpower for defense against the predations of unfriendly Indians, and local resistance to encroachments by the administrators of New England colonies.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|14–19}}&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1910"/&gt;{{rp|161–162}}}} Having obtained privileges of self-government that were not granted to the towns where Dutch settlers resided, the settlers from New England were energetic in defending and where possible expanding these rights against efforts of the administration in New Amsterdam to erode them.&lt;ref name="Stiles1895"/&gt;

In 1648 Hart, as one of Flushing's landholders, joined with four other men to protest the payment of tithes to the pastor of a state-sponsored church and to question the manner of choosing the town's sole magistrate, the [[schout]], who acted as court officer, prosecutor, and sheriff.&lt;ref name="Bailey1894"/&gt; On January 17 of that year the government of New Netherland, now headed by [[Peter Stuyvesant]] summoned the five men to answer for this resistance to the authorities in New Netherland and ordered them to accept the Dutch method for electing their schout.&lt;ref name="Waller1899"/&gt;{{rp|231}}&lt;ref name="Stiles1895"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey1894"/&gt;

Stuyvesant did not relent in his efforts to require the inhabitants of Flushing to support a pastor of his choosing nor did he change the method for electing a schout.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|82}} However, a few months later he expanded local government by granting the town's freeholders the right to elect three additional magistrates, called schaepens, and a clerk.&lt;ref name="Waller1899"/&gt;{{rp|23}} The election of the officials would be subject to confirmation by the New Netherland government but in practice the town's nominations of its officials were routinely accepted.{{refn|group=note|The frequency of elections was not stipulated but is understood to have been annual. In the first election following this change in the town's charter John Underhill was named schout; John Townsend, John Hicks, and William Thorne were named schaepens; and John Lawrence was named clerk. Although one source says that Hart was elected to the position of town clerk on April 27, 1648, that source does not cite evidence,&lt;ref name="Kennedy1939"/&gt;{{rp|3}} and other sources which do give evidence maintain that John Lawrence, was elected at that time.&lt;ref name="Waller1899"/&gt;{{rp|35}}&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan1865"/&gt;{{rp|44, 88, 105}} Flushing and other towns in New Netherland nominated officials for approval by authorities in New Amsterdam. The form is given in a council minute of March 25, 1656.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|343}}}} Although there is some doubt about the names and terms of early clerks, it is certain that Hart was clerk in 1656 for in July of that year he signed himself clerk in responding on behalf of the town's schout and schaepens to a demand from the New Netherland government for payment of a tenth of the town's agricultural production as annual tax as provided in its charter. Hart's letter said that Flushing was "willing to do that which is reasonable and honest" and proposed an amount of produce ("fiftie scipple of peas and twentie-five of wheat") which was apparently acceptable.&lt;ref name="Waller1899"/&gt;{{rp|35–36}}&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|361–362}} That he continued as clerk in 1657 is shown by a letter of his dated January 23, 1657, affirming the town's rights and privileges and complaining that the neighboring town of Hempstead was encroaching on its lands.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|384–385}}&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan1865"/&gt;{{rp|105}}

==Writer of the Flushing Remonstrance==
{{main|Flushing Remonstrance}}
The next document bearing Hart's signature as clerk is the famous [[Flushing Remonstrance]] of December 27, 1657.&lt;ref name="Waller1899"/&gt;{{rp|40–41}}&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|402–408}}&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1910"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Corwin1901"/&gt;{{rp|412–414}}&lt;ref name="FriendsIntelligencer"/&gt;{{rp|54–58}} The towns settled by immigrants from New England were generally granted charters recognizing their right to freedom of conscience but not freedom of religion.&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1910"/&gt;{{rp|167}} In the case of Flushing, the relevant clause granted the original patentees the right "to have and Enjoy the Liberty of Conscience, according of Religion; to the Custome and manner of Holland, without molestacōn or disturbance, from any Magistrate or Magistrates, or any other Ecclesiasticall Minister, that may extend Jurisdiccōn over them."&lt;ref name="Laws and ordinances of New Netherland"/&gt; In practice this meant that men would not be prosecuted for religious practices that did not strongly contradict those of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] which was the official public church in Holland.&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1910"/&gt;{{rp|167}} It also meant that personal beliefs that were contrary to the tenets of the established church would be tolerated so long as they were kept private and expressed only in the narrow circle of the family. Meetings for the public expression of dissenting worship would be prosecuted.&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1910"/&gt;{{rp|3}} Although the early settlers of Flushing complied with these strictures, some of them came into conflict with Stuyvesant and the New Netherlands government when charismatic speakers began to come among them proclaiming nonconformist beliefs.{{refn|group=note|In 1656 a prominent Baptist minister, [[William Wickenden]], was banished and fined for holding illegal religious gatherings and baptizing adult Christians in Flushing.&lt;ref name="JacksonKeller2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Root1890"/&gt; A year later three Quakers were sent away from Manhattan for public preaching and one of them, Robert Hodgson, moved on to Long Island where some of the inhabitants, including residents of Flushing, gave him a warm welcome. Arrested once again, he refused to acknowledge that he had done wrong and would not perform hard labor to which he had been sentenced. As punishment he was treated very severely: put in solitary confinement, beaten, and tortured.&lt;ref name="Bowden1850"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GarmanThesis"/&gt;{{rp|71–77}}&lt;ref name="Brodhead1853"/&gt;}} Believing that Quakers posed the most serious threat to religious and civil tranquility, the administration in New Amsterdam proclaimed that any person who took a Quaker into his home, even for a single night, would be fined fifty pounds and that any ships bringing any Quaker into the province would be confiscated.&lt;ref name="Brodhead1853"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1918Jstor"/&gt;{{rp|210}}&lt;ref name="MaikaJstor"/&gt;{{rp|38}} The schout, magistrates, of Flushing, along with twenty-eight other freeholders of that town and two from neighboring Jamaica recognized that they could not, in conscience, obey this regulation and signed a protest, the Remonstrance, explaining why they could not comply.&lt;ref name="Waller1899"/&gt;{{rp|40–41}}&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1910"/&gt;{{rp|219–220}} The document says Quakers are not seducers of the people nor are they "destructive unto magistracy and ministers" but—along with Presbyterians, Independents, and Baptists—are members of the "household of faith" who, when they "come unto us, we cannot in conscience lay violent hands upon them, but give them free ingress and egress unto our town and houses, so as God shall persuade our consciences." It closes by saying that the signatories "desire to be true subjects both of church and state" according to the law of God and also to the provisions of the town's charter.&lt;ref name="FriendsIntelligencer"/&gt;

The collections of colonial documents of this period contain many protests against government actions, but none of such historic import or eloquence of expression as this.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|passim}}&lt;ref name="MaikaJstor"/&gt;{{rp|37–38}} The Remonstrance "concretely illustrates the seventeenth century practice of speaking Scripture" and is "an unusually rich display of rhetoric and fine English style."&lt;ref name="HarringtonJstor"/&gt; It gives forceful religious arguments for tolerance of other religions and the separation of church and state.&lt;ref name="Haefeli2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Field1863"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Finkelman2003"/&gt; Nonetheless it is framed on Dutch law, adheres closely to legal forms, and contains nothing that might be construed as politically rebellious.&lt;ref name="Voorhees2007"/&gt;

==Government response to the Remonstrance==

The signers of the Remonstrance followed correct procedure in having the town schout, Tobias Feake, submit it to the provincial schout, Nicasius de Sille. De Sille passed it on to Stuyvesant who immediately ordered de Sille to arrest and imprison Feake.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|403–404}}&lt;ref name="Corwin1901"/&gt;{{rp|414}}{{refn|group=note|The provincial schout—officially called Schout-Fiscal and informally called Fiscal—functioned as attorney general and sheriff.&lt;ref name="OCallaghanRegister"/&gt;{{rp|38}}}}{{refn|group=note|There is greater than usual variation in the spelling of the name Feake. Contemporary documents render it as Fecco, Feaks, Feakes, ffeake, Feeque, and Feakx.}}{{refn|group=note|Nicasius de Sille was the son of a prominent statesman [[Nicasius de Sille|of the same name]].}} A few days later—January 1, 1658—he also ordered the arrest of two of the town's magistrates, Thomas Farrington and William Noble,&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|404}}{{refn|group=note|Thomas Farrington was one of the original patentees of Flushing. He was elected schaepen in 1655, 1656, 1657, and 1661.&lt;ref name="OCallaghanRegister"/&gt;{{rp|88–89}} William Noble (or Nobel) had been born in Flushing and was in his mid-30s when first elected schaepen in 1656. He was re-elected to that office in 1657, 1661, 1662, and 1664.&lt;ref name="OCallaghanRegister"/&gt;{{rp|88–90}}}} and on January 3 he summoned Hart to testify.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|404}} Under examination by Stuyvesant and two councilors, Hart said that the Remonstrance contained the sentiments of the community as expressed in a town meeting, that some who were not present at the meeting signed afterward, and that he did not know who called the meeting or who had drafted the document for the community's consideration.{{refn|group=note|Peter Tonneman served as schout and secretary of Brooklyn as well as provincial councilor and schout.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|404ff and 423ff}}}}{{refn|group=note|On January 8 Stuyvesant and the council granted a petition from Farrington and Noble to be released from prison so long as they did not leave Manhattan. Having received from them a letter of apology in which they claimed they had been misled and promised future good conduct, he granted them pardons provided they to pay court costs.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|406–407}} In releasing them the council noted that they acknowledged their error and concluded that they had "been misled by the Schout Tobias Feakx."&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|407}} Asked whether they would continue to serve as magistrates in Flushing, the council said it had not yet decided and asked for important matters to be referred to themselves if any arose.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|407}}}} Having suffered imprisonment for three weeks Hart wrote the governor and council on January 28 requesting to be released. He acknowledged no offense and made no excuse for writing the Remonstrance but begged mercy and consideration for his "poore estate and Condition" and promised that he would "indeavor hereafter to walke inoffensively."&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|408–409}} The council responded the same day. The record of its decision says something about his performance as town clerk and his standing in the community:&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|409}}&lt;blockquote&gt;In Council received and read the foregoing petition of the imprisoned Clerk of Vlissingen, Edward Hart, and having considered his verbal promises of better behavior and the mediation of some inhabitants of said village, also that he has always been an efficient officer and as an old resident is well acquainted with divers matters; further whereas the Schout Tobias Feakx has advised him to draw up the remonstrance recorded on the first of January and he is burdened with a large family,

The Director-General and Council forgive and pardon his error this time on condition of his paying the costs and misses of law.&lt;/blockquote&gt; On March 26 the director-general and council passed an ordinance intended to prevent the town from ever again submitting a "seditious and mutinous" document like the Remonstrance. Saying that "all the late Schouts successively have manifested no small negligence," it added new qualifications for the office aimed at obtaining persons "better versed in Dutch Practice, and somewhat conversant in both languages, the English and Dutch." It also prohibited town meetings for conducting ordinary business and, in their place, instituted a town council consisting of seven persons to assist the schout and magistrates and it required the town to acquire and maintain "an Orthodox Minister" to conduct religious services.&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan1868"/&gt;{{rp|338–341}}

==Responsibility for the Remonstrance==

Hart gave somewhat inconsistent statements in his interrogation by Stuyvesant, de Sille, and Tonneman, saying first that he drew up the Remonstrance on the order of those who signed it in order to record the "opinion of the people" of the town and then saying that he had prepared it before the town meeting at which he submitted it for consideration. He pleaded ignorance concerning the responsibility of any specific individuals as instigators prior to the town meeting. Pressed to explain his inconsistent testimony he said the draft he prepared prior to the meeting contained "what he thought to be the opinion of the people." The questions submitted to Hart show that Stuyvesant and the two councilors suspected that the four town officials who signed the document (the schout, two magistrates, and Hart) bore primary responsibility for it.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|404}} After interrogating the two magistrates and after the two of them and Hart had submitted apologies for their actions, the governor and councilors settled on the schout as mainly responsible.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|409}} Although they singled out Feake for punishment, the ordinance they passed subsequent to the release from imprisonment and pardoning of the Hart and the magistrates maintains that all four of the town's officials were jointly at fault. It says  that most of the men who signed the Remonstrance were "urged to subscribe by the previous signatures of the Schout, Clerk and some Magistrates."&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan1868"/&gt;{{rp|339}}

Historians who have considered this subject have not agreed about who took the lead in preparing the Remonstrance and, as a result, it is not known which of its signers most inspired its moving appeal for freedom of conscience. Some maintain that the schout, Feake, was mainly responsible.&lt;ref name="Robertson1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1910"/&gt;{{rp|220}} Others say it was mainly Hart's doing&lt;ref name="Bailey1894"/&gt; or that, at least, the language was his.&lt;ref name="Robertson1973"/&gt; One says that the four town officials were more or less equally responsible.&lt;ref name="Bowden1850"/&gt; Many accounts say that the responsibility was communal.{{refn|group=note|Most sources take this view. See in particular ''New Netherland and the Dutch Origins of American Religious Liberty'' by Evan Haefeli (2013).&lt;ref name="Haefeli2013"/&gt;{{rp|170}}}} One author makes a case for a strong influence of Baptist beliefs among those who signed the document.&lt;ref name="GarmanThesis"/&gt;

==Life of Edward Hart subsequent to the Remonstrance==

There is little information about Hart following his pardoning and release from prison. In 1660 and 1661 his name appears as a witness on deeds for transfer of land and in the latter year he was listed as a tax collector in Flushing.&lt;ref name="OCallaghanRegister"/&gt;{{rp|36}} On April 13, 1662, Hart wrote Stuyvesant on behalf of Flushing residents to request help in dealing with three Indians "who demand pay for the Land wee live vpon"&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|512}} and later that year (June 26) A man whose name is given as Eduart Hart obtained a translation from the Notary Public in New Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="HollandSocietyYearbook1900"/&gt;{{rp|144}} After that there is no assured documentary evidence regarding him. The last references to a man who is supposed to have been Hart are in records of land transfer. In 1679 a man named Robert West acquired land originally owned by an Edward Hart in Providence, R.I.&lt;ref name="Hopkins2009"/&gt; and in 1707 land formerly owned by him is referred to in a deed filed by a man named William Field.&lt;ref name="Commissioners1909"/&gt; It is likely but not certain that this Edward Hart is the same as the one who wrote the Remonstrance.

==Family of Edward Hart==

Hart's life after 1662 is described from inferences lacking a clear documentary trail. With his wife, Margaret, he is said to have had two sons, Thomas and Jonathan. Hart having returned to Rhode Island and then died, his wife is supposed to have remarried.{{refn|group=note|Examples of these sources include a number of genealogical sites and the following monographs: ''Edward Hart; descendants and allied families'' by Clara Hart Kennedy (Bloomington, Ill., 1939)&lt;ref name="Kennedy1939"/&gt; and ''Profiles of the signers of the Flushing Remonstrance, December 27, 1657'' by Purcell B. Robertson (4 vols. typescript held in Queens Public Library, New York, N.Y.)&lt;ref name="Robertson1973"/&gt; For an instance of doubt about these suppositions see "The Ancestry of the Hon. John Hart, of Hopewell, N.J., Signer of the Declaration of Independence" by Frederick W. Bailey, in ''The New York Genealogical and Biographical Record'', Volumes 25-26 (New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, 1894, New York).&lt;ref name="Bailey1894"/&gt;}} Some genealogical and other sources say that Jonathan Hart died in Newtown, Long Island, in 1671,&lt;ref name="Kennedy1939"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnold1996"/&gt; however ''Early Wills of Westchester County, New York, from 1664 to 1784'' by William Smith Pelletreau (Francis P. Harper, New York, 1898) says that the family of one Monmouth Hart of Rye, New York, is descended from an Edmund Hart who signed the Flushing Remonstrance and that his son, Jonathan Hart, came to Rye in 1685 and subsequently married Hannah Budd.&lt;ref name="PelletreauHaviland1898"/&gt; Thomas Hart is said to have married Freeborn Williams, a daughter of Roger Williams&lt;ref name="Kennedy1939"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnold1996"/&gt; and this fact is supported by a note in ''The genealogical dictionary of Rhode Island'' by John Osborne Austin (Joel Munsells Sons, Albany, 1887). The note says that the Edward Hart who was granted land in Providence and subsequently signed the civil compact of 1640 was the husband of a woman named Margaret and the two were parents of a son named Thomas. It says that this son lived in Newport, Rhode Island, and was husband of Freeborn Williams, daughter of [[Roger Williams]] and his wife Mary.&lt;ref name="Austin1887"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bolton1881"/&gt; Although most sources accept that this Edward Hart is the same man as the one who drafted the Remonstrance, they offer no evidence to support their inference.

==Documentary evidence on the life of Edward Hart==

In 1789 all the records of the town of Flushing were destroyed in a fire{{refn|group=note|"The most important event of the closing years of the last century was the destruction of the town records by the burning of the residence of the clerk, Jeremiah Vanderbilt. It was set on fire by Nellie, a slave girl belonging to Capt. Daniel Braine, who had been hired to work in the family, and who, conceiving a dislike for her new mistress, took this way to revenge the fancied injury. She was arrested in company with Sarah, one of Vanderbilt's slaves, and on their own confession they were sentenced to be hanged. Sarah was afterwards reprieved on condition that she be removed from the island. Nellie was hanged at Jamaica, after having been in jail fifty weeks. Aaron Burr, then attorney-general for the State, conducted the prosecution."&lt;ref name="HistoryOfQueensCounty1882"/&gt;{{rp|85}}}} and in 1911 a fire caused serious damage to the manuscripts of the New Netherland colony.{{refn|group=note|"While many ... Dutch volumes were charred at the edges, they survived because they had been kept on shelves close to the floor, below the English volumes. When the fire caused the shelves to collapse, the Dutch books were buried under the English ones, which suffered far greater damage, many being completely destroyed. The surviving 17th century Colonial Manuscripts are being transcribed, translated and published in two series commenced in 1974, New Netherland Documents (formerly New York Historical Manuscripts: Dutch) and New York Historical Manuscripts: English."&lt;ref name="Macy1999"/&gt;}} Although no copies had been made of the Flushing documents and they were thus lost forever, many of the Dutch colonial documents had been transcribed and printed prior to the 1911 fire.&lt;ref name="EducationDeptBulletin1910"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|See the ''Calendar of Historical Manuscripts in the Office of the Secretary of State'' (Weed, Parsons and Co., Albany, N.Y., 1865-66),&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan1865"/&gt; ''Laws and Ordinances of New Netherland, 1638-1674'' (Weed, Parsons and Co., Albany, N.Y., 1868),&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan1868"/&gt; ''The Register of New Netherland, 1626 to 1674'' (J.

This practice consists of an outpouring of ministry in which words and phrases of Scripture are woven into the discourse with no mention of "chapter or verse," but in a manner by which they can be clearly identified as Scripture. The ministry of George Fox displays this feature but the Flushing Remonstrance is an unusually concentrated illustration of it. In these ministers, Scripture had been so thoroughly assimilated that its words and phrases became a part of the person. What follows is the text of the Flushing Remonstrance with the Biblical phrases identified by chapter and verse in the King James Version. This compilation may not exhaust the Biblical elements to be found in the Remonstrance, but it suggests the possibilities. |doi=10.1353/qkh.1993.0010}}&lt;!--|access-date=2015-08-15 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Having felt the keen blasts of proscription and outlawry on account of their religious views, and having sought this place as a permanent refuge, relying upon the well accredited liberality of the government of Holland, which had purchased for its subjects the price of religious liberty at a terrible cost of blood and treasure, and which was disposed to accord the privileges it had gained to the oppressed of every nation—the people of Flushing were surprised to find, within three years from the date of their charter, that Governor Kieft was about to enforce upon them arbitrary and uncalled for restrictions in civil matters, as well as to impose upon them the maiutaiuance of a minister of the Reformed (State) Dutch Church.

Two of these persons, Dorothy Waugh and Mary Witherhead, began to preach publicly in the streets, for which breach of the law they were arrested and imprisoned. A few days afterwards they were discharged; and the ship, with most of her Quaker passengers, sailed onward, through Hell-gate, to Rhode Island, "where all kinds of scum dwell, for it is nothing else than a sink for New England."&lt;br&gt;But Robert Hodgson, one of the Quakers, wishing to remain in the Dutch province, went over to Long Island. At Flushing he was well received. On visiting Heemstede, however, where Denton, the Presbyterian clergyman, ministered, Hodgson was arrested and committed to prison, whence he was transferred to the dungeon of Fort Amsterdam. Upon his examination before the council, he was convicted, and sentenced to labor two years at a wheelbarrow, along with a negro, or pay a fine of six hundred guilders. After a few days confinement, he was chained to a barrow, and ordered to work; and upon his refusal, was beaten by a negro with a tarred rope until he fell down. At length, after frequent scourgings and solitary imprisonments, the suffering Quaker was liberated, at the intercession of the director's sister, Anna, widow of Nicholas Bayard, and ordered to leave the province.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4100">'''Evaluative conditioning''' is defined as a change in the valence of a [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] that is due to the pairing of that stimulus with another positive or negative stimulus. The first stimulus is often referred to as the conditioned stimulus and the second stimulus as the unconditioned stimulus. A conditioned stimulus becomes more positive when it has been paired with a positive unconditioned stimulus and more negative when it has been paired with a negative unconditioned stimulus.{{sfn|Hofmann |De Houwer |Perugini |Baeyens|2010|p=391}} Evaluative conditioning thus refers to attitude formation or change toward an object due to that object's mere co-occurrence with another object.{{sfn|Jones|Olson|Fazio|2010|p=205}}

Evaluative conditioning is a form of [[classical conditioning]], as invented by [[Ivan Pavlov]], in that it involves a change in the responses to the conditioned stimulus that results from pairing the conditioned stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus. Whereas classic conditioning can refer to a change in any type of response, evaluative conditioning concerns only a change in the evaluative responses to the conditioned stimulus, that is, a change in the liking of the conditioned stimulus.{{sfn|Hofmann |De Houwer |Perugini |Baeyens|2010|p=391}}

A classic example of the formation of attitudes through conditioning is the 1958 experiment by Staats and Staats.{{sfn|Staats|Staats|1958}} Subjects first were asked to learn a list of words that were presented visually, and were tested on their learning of the list. They then did the same with a list of words presented orally, all of which set the stage for the critical phase of the experiment which was portrayed as an assessment of subjects’ ability to learn via both visual and auditory channels at once. During this phase, subjects were exposed visually to a set of nationality names, specifically Dutch and Swedish. Approximately one second after the nationality appeared on the screen, the experimenter announced a word aloud. Most of these latter words, none of which were repeated, were neutral (e.g., chair, with, twelve). Included, however, were a few positive words (e.g., gift, sacred, happy) and a few negative words (e.g., bitter, ugly, failure). These words were systematically paired with the two conditional stimuli nationalities such that one always appeared with positive words and the other with negative words. Thus, the conditioning trials were embedded within a stream of visually presented nationality names and orally presented words. When the conditioning phase was completed, the subjects were first asked to recall the words that had been presented visually and then to evaluate them, presumably because how they felt about those words might have affected their learning. The conditioning was successful. The nationality that had been paired with the more positive unconditional stimuli was rated as more pleasant than the one paired with the negative unconditional stimuli.{{sfn|Jones|Olson|Fazio|2010|p=205-206}}

The expulsion of the Jews from [[Sicily]] began in 1493 when the [[Spanish Inquisition]] reached the island of [[Sicily]] and its population of more than 30,000 Jews.

==History of the Jews of Sicily and the Spanish Inquisition==
===History of the Sicilian Jews===
{{main|History of the Jews in Sicily}}
At the time of expulsion from Sicily, the Jewish community in Sicily dated back to early [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, and they were relatively untroubled on the island until the acceptance of the [[Crown of Aragon]] in Sicily in 1412. A great number of Jews had reached Sicily after [[Pompey]]'s 63 BC sacking of [[Jerusalem]].

After the enslavement under Roman rule, Jews in Sicily eventually assimilated into society, working in professions such as philosophy, medicine, artisanal pursuits, and farming.

The exact number of Jews in Sicily at the time of expulsion is not certain, However, some have put the number of Jewish refugees at 36,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gulnbla.tripod.com/main.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, in 1492, it is known the Jewish populations of [[Palermo]], [[Messina]], and several other cities were considerable, and that there were ''[[La Giudecca|Giudeccas]]'', or Jewish settlements, in over 50 places in Sicily, ranging in anywhere population from 350 to 5,000. At their height, Jewish Sicilians probably constituted from five to eight percent of the island's population.[http://www.bestofsicily.com/religion.htm]

===History of the Spanish Inquisition and Jewish Expulsion===
[[Image:Aragonese Empire.PNG|thumb|left|250px|The maximum extent of the Crown of Aragon, including Sicily.]]
Muslims had ruled much of the Iberian Peninsula since the first invasion in 711. By the late Middle Ages, Christian kings had begun to wage war on the Moors and recapture some of the peninsula. After the marriage of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] to Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]], the Moors were finally forced out of Granada in 1492, completing the so-called [[Reconquista]] of the Iberian Peninsula.

In 1479 Sicily and [[Malta]] came under [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]]ese rule. In 1492, as part of an attempt to maintain Catholic orthodoxy and purify their kingdom of Moorish influence, [[Ferdinand and Isabella]] ordered the forced [[Alhambra decree|expulsion]] or conversion of all Jews on pain of death. The date of the expulsion was extended from 18 September 1492 to 12 January 1493, in order to allow the extortion of opportunist tax levies. 

Many Sicilian Jews fled to the neighboring mainland of [[Calabria]], where the [[Spanish Inquisition]]&lt;sup&gt;It wasn't the Inquisition.&lt;/sup&gt; caught up with them again fifty years later.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Not all of the Sicilian Jews departed. A small number of Sicily's Jewish community converted to Catholicism and remained on the island. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.michaelfreund.org/10311/jewish-sicily&lt;/ref&gt;

The great part of the Sicilian Jewish community fled to the [[Ottoman Empire]], especially to what is since the twentieth century [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]] and Turkey. They were well received there. The settlements of these Jews were in Greece and Turkey were large enough great to build their own congregations and to print books.&lt;ref&gt;"Chronika" Vol. 57, Periodical of the Central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece, Athens March 1983, Greek transl. from Goldschmidt, D. In "Sefunot" Vol. 13, Jerusalem, Ben Zvi Institute 1971-1978 (Hebrew) „Prayerbooks of the Jews of Greece“.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nosek, B. Italian and Sicilian Piyyut in contemporary Context and its unique Contribution to further poetical Output Bedřich Nosek, CSc. Mgr. Sylva Ondrejičková Praha, 2011 (Czech)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jews have never returned en masse to Sicily. However, in 2005, for the first time since the Expulsion, a [[Passover seder]] was conducted in Sicily (in Palermo), held by the [[Milan]]ese progressive [[Rabbi]].

The '''Foreign and Commonwealth Office migrated archives''' are sensitive and incriminating collections of documents from Britain's former [[British Empire|colonial governments]] that were sent back to the UK (hence ''migrated'') on the eve of decolonisation for storage in the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|FCO]] archives to avoid their disclosure and subsequent embarrassment to [[Government of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty's Government]]. A great many similar documents were not repatriated, but instead destroyed.

[[Ben Macintyre]] of the ''[[The Times|Times]]'' summarised the procedure for [[Declassification|declassifying]] Foreign Office archival material as follows:
{{quotation|Under the [[Public Records Act 1958|Public Records Act]], documents are liable for release to the National Archives after 30 years. Up to 60 per cent of material is shredded and burnt at this stage. Less than 1 per cent is kept secret. Under the present rules, the Foreign Office may retain documents relating to intelligence, national security and defence. Some files transferred to the archives remain closed if they are deemed potentially harmful to international relations or contain personal information. Any decision to retain official documents is subject to scrutiny by the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Council on National Records and Archives, a panel chaired by Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury, the Master of the Rolls.&lt;ref name = "Mac 16Apr2011"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article2988362.ece |last= Macintyre |first= Ben |date= 16 April 2011 |title= Mau Mau and so much more: inside the Foreign Office house of secrets |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 27 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Once at Hanslope, reviewing documents for release is a job for seventeen part-time "sensitivity reviewers", mostly retired Foreign Office officials; it is rare for a file to be judged sensitive enough to warrant withholding it in entirety.&lt;ref name = "Mac 16Apr2011"/&gt; When it came to the migrated archives, however, the question of whether they fell within the scope of the Public Records Act 1958 was never answered definitively, and so they were conveniently left undisturbed in archival stasis.&lt;ref name = "Mac 16Apr2011"/&gt;

In 2005, two [[Freedom of information in the United Kingdom|Freedom of Information]] (FoI) requests were submitted to the FCO by researchers wanting [[Mau Mau]]-era government files. The second request was very specific, and did not warrant checking the migrated archives, but the first request should have warranted such a check, yet none was made.{{sfn|Cary|2011|pp=8–9}} More seriously still, in 2006, lawyers for [[Leigh Day &amp; Co|Leigh Day]], the legal firm representing former Mau Mau members who were attempting to sue the UK for their torture during the uprising, submitted a court disclosure request for "a final tranche of documents relating to the suppression of the Mau Mau" that the government was "refusing to release";{{sfn|Cary|2011|pp=9–10}} the FCO response explicitly denied the existence of this tranche of documents, i.e. the migrated archives, stating that all information they had held had been transferred to [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] (TNA).{{sfn|Cary|2011|p=10}} The [[Treasury Solicitor's Department|Treasury Solicitor]]'s response to Leigh Day went even further, stating that not only were all relevant documents with TNA but that they were also in the public domain.{{sfn|Cary|2011|p=10}} It was only the persistence of a handful of FCO officials, notably Edward Inglett,&lt;ref name = "Times Inglett"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article2979182.ece |last= Macintyre |first= Ben |date= 9 April 2011 |title= One Foreign Office worker's dogged pursuit of 'missing' Mau Mau files |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 29 May 2012 |quote= If the 35-year-old Kenya desk officer at the Africa department of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office had not made it his mission to find the 1,500 missing files, they would still be lying in secret archives at Hanslope Park. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. Mr Inglett was told by IMG, repeatedly, that there was no trace of the files. Finally, on January 13, he announced that he was coming to Hanslope Park, with a lawyer, to find the files himself. Three days later, the files were found. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a witness statement by [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] professor David Anderson in December 2010 alleging "systematic withholding by [[Government of the United Kingdom|HMG]] of 1,500 files in 300 boxes taking up 100 linear feet", that eventually resulted in the migrated archives coming to light in January 2011.&lt;ref name="times_12042011a"&gt;{{cite news| newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=12 April 2011 |title=Foreign Office says sorry for misplacing Mau Mau papers |author1=Ben Macintyre |author2=Billy Kenber |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article2981762.ece |accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon their 'discovery', [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[William Hague]] requested Anthony Cary, a former British High Commissioner to Canada, to conduct an internal review into why the migrated archives had been spotlighted neither by the FoI requests nor by the initial Court Disclosure request.{{sfn|Cary|2011|p=1}} Cary reported the following month, and outlined the background as follows:
{{quotation|As British dependent territories came to independence decisions had to be taken about which papers to destroy, which to leave for successor administrations, and which to ship back to the UK. The general rule, as set out in a [[Colonial Office]] guidance telegram of 3 May 1961 on the 'disposal of classified records and accountable documents', was the successor Governments should not be given papers which:&lt;br /&gt;
* might embarrass HMG or other Governments;
* might embarrass members of the police, military forces, public servants or others eg police informers;
* might compromise sources of intelligence information; or
* might be used unethically by Ministers in the successor Government
In addition ''"There would be little object in handing over documents which would patently be of no value to the successor Government"''. A great many documents were destroyed on this basis, but others were returned to the UK. These became the so-called 'migrated archives', eventually totalling around 8,800 files.{{sfn|Cary|2011|p=1}}}}
{{quote box
| quote = Britain does not stand alone in facing such colonial legacies. Despite a public apology made in 2004 and the pledge of increased aid commitments to Namibia, the German Government still faces claims from the Herero peoples over a genocide inflicted in 1904. The Italians, too, are entangled in claims from their occupation of Libya. Silvio Berlusconi has gone further than the Germans, issuing an apology and promising a reparations payment of $5 billion.

The British will look toward the German and not the Italian model in handling the Mau Mau case. An apology should be issued to Kenya, and if it was to be given with a pledge of development assistance, then this might help to lay the ghosts of the past.

This should happen, but is it likely? It would imply an admission that torture had taken place under British rule in Kenya. We are making fools of ourselves by denying this. It is time to face up.&lt;ref name = "Anders 2009"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/africa/article2594283.ece |last= David Anderson |first= David |date= 23 June 2009 |title= Mau Mau claim will be fought every step of the way |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 26 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One excuse offered by the FCO for their failure to consult the files was that the ownership of the papers was confused, that the FCO merely possessed stewardship, thus the archives had been considered "out of bounds" for FoI requests (the FCO were not the owners, so they did not have the right to go through the documents). Cary, however, managed to uncover the fact that this was not the case, that there had been "major exceptions to the general principle that these papers have been considered 'out of bounds'."{{sfn|Cary|2011|p=6}} Such an excuse became irrelevant after the 2006 legal request from Leigh Day because ''all'' documents have to be checked when it comes to court cases.{{sfn|Cary|2011|p=10}} "It was perhaps convenient to [think] that the migrated archives .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. did not need to be consulted for the purposes of FOI requests, while also being conscious of the files as a sort of guilty secret, of uncertain status and in the 'too difficult' tray", Cary concluded.{{sfn|Cary|2011|p=12}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13336343 |title=Mau Mau torture files were 'guilty secret' |author=BBC News |date=9 May 2011 |accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The search that turned up the "lost" documents on Mau Mau revealed a second raft of documents had also been "lost" and, hopefully, also therefore awaited discovery.

===The process of removal/destruction===
Documents that were to be left to post-independence governments, known as "legacy files", were separated from "watch files", which were marked for destruction or repatriation. In Uganda, the process was codenamed Operation Legacy; in Kenya, the process was described as "a thorough purge" and directed by colonial Special Branch officers. Africans were forbidden from involvement: only "a servant of the Kenya government who is a British subject of European descent" could participate. The watch-file instructions also made clear to leave no trace of their existence to successor governments: "The legacy files must leave no reference to watch material. Indeed, the very existence of the watch series, though it may be guessed at, should never be revealed." If possible, a dummy file was inserted to ensure file and page numbering was uninterrupted by the cull; when too many dummies were needed, they simply removed or destroyed the entire section. In Kenya, instructions insisted that "emphasis is placed upon destruction", meaning much of the most shocking material was probably destroyed, and "the waste should be reduced to ash and the ashes broken up", so that not even a trace of the destruction was left. Large quantities of files were also "packed in weighted crates and dumped in very deep and current-free water at maximum practicable distance from the coast". Malaya's purge was less rigorous, and was facilitated by less experienced officials.&lt;ref name = "G docs 2012a"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "BBC 2012 docs"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17734735 |last= Wallis |first= Holly |date= 18 April 2012 |title= British colonial files released following legal challenge |publisher= BBC News |accessdate= 29 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "G blog 2012"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2012/apr/18/national-archives-release-colonial-papers-live-blog#block-2 |last= Bowcott |first= Owen |date= 18 April 2012  |title= National Archives release colonial papers: 11.20am update |publisher= guardian.co.uk |accessdate= 30 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction and contents==
Cary's report and the documents initially released had shown that, on 3 December 1963, nine days before Kenya formally declared independence, three wooden packing crates containing 1,500 highly sensitive government files were loaded on to a British United Airways flight bound for Gatwick. On the eve of Kenya's independence, Colonial Secretary [[Iain Macleod]] ordered that sensitive colonial-government documentation be destroyed or flown out of the country because its disclosure "might embarrass Her Majesty's Government".&lt;ref name="times_05042011b"/&gt;{{sfn|Cary|2011|p=1}}&lt;ref name = "G docs 2012a"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/18/britain-destroyed-records-colonial-crimes |last1= Cobain |first1= Ian |last2= Bowcott |first2= Owen |last3= Norton-Taylor |first3= Richard |date= 18 April 2012 |title= Britain destroyed records of colonial crimes |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 26 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Embarrassment hardly covers it," remarked a ''Times'' editorial, noting that "the covert history of colonial administration in Kenya bears comparison to the methods of torture and summary execution in the French war in Algeria."&lt;ref name="times_05042011c"&gt;{{cite news| newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=5 April 2011 |title=Crimes of colonialism |author=Editorial |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/leaders/article2972824.ece |accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, the government officially admitted for the first time not merely to having relevant Mau Mau documents, but that it had a total of 8,800 files from 37 ex-colonies,&lt;ref name = "admission 1"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article2974649.ece |last= Macintyre |first= Ben |date= 6 April 2011 |title= Britain's colonial files to be released |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 30 May 2012 |quote= Lord Howell confirmed .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. for the first time last night .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. that the Foreign Office holds 8,800 files from 37 former British administrations }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "admission 2"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article2974649.ece |last= Macintyre |first= Ben |date= 8 April 2011 |title= Archive at 'spook central' had secret Mau Mau files |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 30 May 2012 |quote= On Tuesday night, Lord Howell of Guildford, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office minister, made a statement acknowledging for the first time that it was 'general practice for the colonial administration to transfer to the United Kingdom, shortly before independence, selected documents which were not appropriate to hand on to the successor Government'. }}&lt;/ref&gt; which it would make public in batches from April 2012 to November 2013.&lt;ref name = "Econ 21Apr2012"&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.economist.com/node/21553073 |date= 21 April 2012 |title= End of empire |journal= The Economist |accessdate= 27 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' opined: "Even given the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's apparent skill in such matters, it is quite a feat to ignore 300 boxes of documents filling 110ft of shelving for almost half a century."&lt;ref name = "T ed 07Apr2011"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/leaders/article2975963.ece |author= Editorial |date= 7 April 2011 |title= Dust and Denial |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 30 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Anderson, describing the Mau Mau initial 2011 revelations as just a start, emphasised that other former British domains, including Malaya, Cyprus, and the Gulf States, likewise await a final reckoning, and that colonial personnel and tactics subsequently made their way into the policing of [[The Troubles]].&lt;ref name = "DaAn 22Jul2011"/&gt; In particular, noted [[Aileen McColgan]], the techniques alleged in 1950s Kenya were refined into what are now known as the "[[five techniques]]" for use in internment in 1970s Northern Ireland: wall-standing, [[hooding]], subjection to noise, [[Sleep deprivation|deprivation of sleep]], and deprivation of food and drink. She went on to note: "The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 1977 that Britain had breached Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture and 'inhuman and degrading treatment', by the use of the five techniques in Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister, Edward Heath, told the Commons in 1972 that the techniques would [[Death of Baha Mousa|never again]] be used 'as an aid to interrogation', a commitment reiterated before the European Court."&lt;ref name = "McColgan 2012"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/law/article2977823.ece |last= McColgan |first= Aileen |date= 8 April 2011 |title= Inquiries won't show Britain at its best |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 29 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Cary investigation, Hague appointed [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]'s [[Tony Badger]] as "colonial files tsar" to oversee the review and transfer of the hidden files to the public domain. The Foreign Office duly released a first batch of more than 1,200 records from 12 former colonial territories in April 2012, a portion of some 10,000 files that Britain removed from 37 of its colonies.&lt;ref name = "Elkins 18Apr2012"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/apr/18/colonial-papers-fco-transparency-myth |last= Elkins |first= Caroline |date= 18 April 2012 |title= The colonial papers: FCO transparency is a carefully cultivated myth |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 7 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Badger described the migrated archives episode as "embarrassing, scandalous. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. These documents should have been in the public archives in the 1980s. It's long overdue."&lt;ref name = "G docs 2012a"/&gt; [[Harvard]]'s [[Caroline Elkins]] observed: "At the time, Britain was in the middle of parallel, massive cover-ups. While the government was besieged publicly with allegations of brutalities in the detention camps and the cover-up of systematised violence—and denying all allegations—it was culling and purging the record. The process—practised in other colonies as well—deliberately sought to remove incriminating evidence. So, too, did it seek to shape the future colonial archive and the realities it would produce."&lt;ref name = "Elkins 18Apr2012"/&gt;

The ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' stated:
{{quote|Among the documents that appear to have been destroyed were: records of the abuse of Mau Mau insurgents detained by British colonial authorities, who were tortured and sometimes murdered; reports that may have detailed the alleged massacre of 24 unarmed villagers in Malaya by soldiers of the Scots Guards in 1948; most of the sensitive documents kept by colonial authorities in Aden, where the army's Intelligence Corps operated a secret torture centre for several years in the 1960s; and every sensitive document kept by the authorities in British Guiana, a colony whose policies were heavily influenced by successive US governments and whose post-independence leader was toppled in a coup orchestrated by the CIA.&lt;ref name = "G docs 2012a"/&gt;}}

As the ''Guardian'''s summary shows, even after the first 2012 release of Tony Badger's review, the FCO continued to deny the existence of documentation on the repeated British subversion of democracy in [[British Guiana]] in the 1950s and 1960s, though [[Richard Drayton]], [[Rhodes Professor of Imperial History]] at [[King's College London]], said this was simply not credible: "When Kenyan historians requested documents in the past, they were told repeatedly by the FCO that they had been destroyed, only for the FCO, under judicial pressure, to yield them. It is to be hoped that the FCO will at some point 'discover' its British Guiana archive.

There was wide agreement that the FCO was still withholding files. [[Keith Flett]] said: "It is likely to be correct that despite William Hague's professed policy of transparency towards the release of government files from the colonial era that far from everything will be released and it will depend on the skills of historians to spot gaps in the record."&lt;ref name = "Guardian letters"/&gt; Elkins, who, like Anderson, is an expert witness for the Mau Mau legal action, highlighted the need for caution, and wrote of her involvement with trying to get files out of the foreign office for analysis back at Harvard: "This process has been anything but straightforward. Despite the legal context, the FCO has culled files, requiring multiple requests for full disclosure, and still files have not been forthcoming."&lt;ref name = "Elkins 18Apr2012"/&gt; Of the April 2012 release, she noted that it "excludes territories such as Palestine and Rhodesia. The Cyprus files exclude the period of the emergency. The Malaya files cover very little of the contested emergency years. The Kenya documents are a meagre subset of the files released (though culled) in the context of the Mau Mau case. For all 12 colonies covered in today's release, there appears to be a great deal pertaining to finance, tourism, administration and the like. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. The first release of the 'migrated archives' is, at first glance, lacking in substantive files, particularly for former colonies like Cyprus and Malaya where future lawsuits potentially loom."&lt;ref name = "Elkins 18Apr2012"/&gt;

[[Laleh Khalili]] of [[School of Oriental and African Studies|SOAS]] declared:
{{quote|The Aden material was ludicrous. Given the extent [of] torture and ill-treatment, detention and protest in that colony in its latter years, it was laughable to see the released files having to do with fisheries. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.

Journalist Ian Cobain and others suggested that, owing to the nature of the British withdrawal from the [[Colony of Aden]], the incriminating material may, instead of being withheld, actually have been more comprehensively destroyed at the time of decolonisation, rather than migrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2012/apr/18/national-archives-release-colonial-papers-live-blog#block-8 |last1= Cobain |first1= Ian |last2= Bowcott |first2= Owen |date= 18 April 2012 |title= National Archives release colonial papers: 3.51pm update |publisher= guardian.co.uk |accessdate= 30 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2012/apr/18/national-archives-release-colonial-papers-live-blog#block-9 |last1= Gooding |first1= Francis |last2= Bowcott |first2= Owen |date= 18 April 2012 |title= National Archives release colonial papers: 5.09pm update |publisher= guardian.co.uk |accessdate= 30 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Badger accepted that historians believed the FCO was "up to its old tricks again", and added: "Given the failure of the Foreign Office to acknowledge the existence of the migrated archives, I understand the legacy of suspicion. It is difficult to overestimate the degree of suspicion."&lt;ref name = "G docs 2012b"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/18/sins-colonialists-concealed-secret-archive |last1= Cobain |first1= Ian |last2= Norton-Taylor |first2= Richard |date= 18 April 2012 |title= Sins of colonialists lay concealed for decades in secret archive |publisher= guardian.co.uk |accessdate= 28 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ominously, the ''Guardian'' noted:
{{quote|In a number of colonies, as files were destroyed a certificate was completed and sent to London to show that the job had been done. Could these certificates also be stored at Hanslope Park, providing a glimpse of the contents of each file that was destroyed? The FCO was refusing to say on Tuesday, and insisted that any queries about such certificates should be the subject of an freedom of information request. Furthermore, Cary's report states that a separate inquiry is now examining the fate of a number of files that were lost or destroyed after they were returned to the UK.

Bennett said that "the British Army retained ultimate operational control over all security forces throughout the Emergency", and that its military intelligence operation worked "hand in glove" with the Kenyan Special Branch "including in screening and interrogations in centres and detention camps".&lt;ref name = "Torture 2011"/&gt;

===Cyprus===
The release of material in 2011 sparked legal threats from veterans of [[EOKA#EOKA_allegations_of_torture_by_British_forces|EOKA]], who fought a campaign against the British occupation of Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article2983111.ece |last= Theodoulou |first= Michael |date= 13 April 2011 |title= Greek Cypriots intend to sue Britain over torture in 1950s uprising |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 9 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cyprus-mail.com/cyprus/eoka-fighters-sue-brits-over-torture/20110414 |last= Dewhurst |first= Patrick |date= 14 April 2011 |title= EOKA fighters to sue Brits over torture |newspaper= [[Cyprus Mail]] |accessdate= 9 May 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110518083948/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/cyprus/eoka-fighters-sue-brits-over-torture/20110414 |archivedate= 18 May 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plans for chemical warfare testing in Botswana===
In 1943, Britain planned to test a "very virulent" type of poison gas in what was [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|Bechuanaland]] (now [[Botswana]]). On 6 June 1943, Harold Eddey Priestman, Administrative Secretary to the High Commissioner in South Africa, sent a hand-written letter, marked "secret and personal", to Aubrey Denzil Forsyth-Thompson, Resident Commissioner of Bechuanaland, in which he explained: "Certain types of poison gas are being manufactured in the union [South Africa] on UK account. The UK Ministry of Aircraft Production have now asked that practical trials may be carried out on a considerable scale. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. We understand this poison gas is a very virulent type. It would therefore be necessary 1) to preclude access to the experimental area for a considerable time after the experiments had ceased. 2) and also to take into consideration any danger of the gas being carried by wind to areas adjacent to the experimental area."

The British looked for an "isolated area" within "reasonable distance" of an air base, that had a 15-mile buffer zone with no water sources, and that was "comparatively free from vegetation". Nowhere suitable could be found in South Africa, but they provisionally settled on somewhere in the [[Makgadikgadi Pan]]. Forsyth-Thompson later said that he was unwilling to consider testing in that area because it was surrounded by farms and it would be impossible to maintain secrecy. Under the codename of FORENSIC, air-launched trials were envisaged, but the approach of the rainy season prevented testing from going ahead. There is currently no evidence FORENSIC was actually executed.

Although it was never deployed, Britain stockpiled poison gas because of fears of its possible use by Germany.&lt;ref name = "Botswana"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article3387203.ece |last1= Malvern |first1= Jack |last2= Kenber |first2= Billy |date= 18 April 2012 |title= Poison gas tests planned for site in Botswana |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 29 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "G Bots chem"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/18/britain-poison-gas-tests-botswana |last= Norton-Taylor |first= Richard |date= 18 April 2012 |title= Britain planned poison gas tests in Botswana, records reveal |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 30 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9901">'''Free warren'''&amp;mdash;often simply ''warren''&amp;mdash;refers to a type of [[Exclusive right|franchise]] or [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]] conveyed by a [[sovereign]] in [[medieval]] [[England]] to an English subject, promising to hold them harmless for killing [[game (hunting)|game]] of certain species within a stipulated area, usually a [[Woodland|wood]] or small [[forest]].  The sovereign involved might be either the [[monarch]] or a [[Marcher Lords|marcher lord]].

==Law==
The grant of free warren could be as a gift, or in exchange for consideration, and might be later alienated by the grantee.  The stipulated area might be coextensive with the [[frank-tenement]] of the grantee, or it might be discontinuous or even at a considerable remove from the grantee's holdings.  The right of free warren did not extend automatically to the [[Fee simple|freeholder]] of the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |ref=harv|last=Craies
|first=William Feilden |year=1911a |wstitle=Game Laws |volume=11 |pages=440–441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the rights of free warren are usually discussed in the context of [[Royal forest#Forest law|forest law]], the only law which applied within the warren was [[common law]].  Thus, even though the warrant ultimately derived from the sovereign, the only statutes applied to [[poaching|poachers]] in a warren were the common-law crimes of [[theft]] and [[trespass]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oll.libertyfund.org/Texts/McKechnie0323/HTMLs/0032_Pt02_Text.html Magna Carta: A Commentary on the Great Charter of King John, with and Historical Introduction, by William Sharp McKechnie (Glasgow: Maclehose, 1914).]&lt;/ref&gt;

The privilege of free warren was a [[Mutual assent|reciprocal]] relationship.  The grantee of the warren was granted an exemption from the law (under which all game in the realm was property of the sovereign), but the grantee owed the sovereign the stewardship and protection of the game from all others who might wish to hunt it.

==Etymology==
Modern [[English language|English]] ''warren'' ← [[Middle English|ME]] ''warrene'', ''warreine'' ← [[Old Norman|ONF]]  ''warrenne'' ← [[Germanic language|Germanic]] present participle of *''warian''  "to take care; to cause to care (for)" ← causative of *''waran'' "to care" ← ''*war'' "care".  Doublet of ''[[guarantor]]''.  Related to [[Old High German|OHG]] ''werien'' (i.e. ''*wärian'') "to defend, protect", and also to English "a-ware, wary".
&lt;ref&gt;A [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] etymology for ''warren'' has been proposed, based on the notion of "post → enclosure"; but this ignores the documented evolution of the term from the [[Germanic language|Germanic]], as well as being semantically inappropriate for an unenclosed [[woodland]].[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=warren&amp;searchmode=none]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Free warren and domestic warren==
The original use of ''free warren'' was as a legal term.  However, as the franchise defined both a set of species and a geographic extent, the natural semantic extensions arose, namely for the individual animals as a group, or for the land they inhabited.  As it became pragmatically necessary for [[Fee simple|freeholders]] not holding a free warren to enclose their breeding establishments, these "closed warrens" or '''[[Warren (domestic)|domestic warren]]s''' began also to be designated simply as "warrens" (use recorded in 1378; [[OED]]). In 1649 the metaphoric use as "cluster of densely populated living spaces" is recorded.

==Warren and warden==
The [[Mediaeval Latin]] form of the word ''warenna'' was used in legal documents such as [[Magna Carta]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnsnews.com/Library/magnacharta.htm Magna Charta&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the office of warden is used for the overseer of a warren:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(5) But the warden, as long as he hath the custody of the lands, shall keep up and maintain the houses, parks, warrens, ponds, mills, and other things belonging to them, our of their issues;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The warden of a [[Royal forest]] was often the [[castellan]] or [[constable]] of the nearest royal castle; over time the less exalted title of ''warrener'' evolved for the custodian of the lowest of the hunting franchises, the warren.

==Warren and warrant==
The adjective ''free'' in ''free warren'' does not refer to the lack of enclosure surrounding the precincts of the warren, but rather to the fact the "liberty" of hunting derives from a [[warrant (law)|warrant of the sovereign]]. That is,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |last=Craies |first=William Feilden |year=1911b |wstitle=Warrant |volume=28 |pages=327–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The term "warrant" occurs very early in constitutional documents: it is found in the Assize of Clarendon and the Assize of the Forest, both in the reign of Henry II., but in neither case in its modern meaning. The original meaning seems to have been more akin to guarantee (q.v.), warranty or security; and to some extent the term implies something in the nature of a guarantee or representation by the person issuing the warrant that the person who acts on it can do so without incurring any legal penalty.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All of the terms ''warrant'', ''warrantor'', and ''warranty'' are used in [[Henry II of England]]'s [[Assize of the Forest]] (a.k.a. [[Assize of Woodstock]]) in 1184:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uFA0AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA25 ''The Assize of the Forest (Woodstock) 1184 Henry II'']&lt;/ref&gt;

:Article 2. Item, he has commanded that no one shall have bows, arrows, dogs, or hounds in his forests, unless [such person] has the '''warrant''' of the king or of some other man who can [lawfully] be his '''warrantor'''.

:Article 9. Item, the king forbids all clergymen to commit any offences touching his venison or his forests. He strictly orders his foresters that, if they find such men committing offences, they shall not hesitate to lay hands on those men in order to hold them and put them under attachment; he himself will give full '''warranty'''.

==Beasts of warren==
The permission to take game was limited to certain types of animals.  Generally, the killing of [[vermin]] (defined as [[predator]]s and other beasts not fit for the table) was not regulated.  This definition was flexible, however, depending on whether the animal was thought to provide good sport, as wolves, foxes, badgers, or bears.  In practice, vermin could only be killed on the [[commons]] or waste, since none but the grantee was permitted to have instruments of the hunt within the warren.

===Manwood===
The most cited authority on [[Royal forest#Forest law|Forest Law]], [[John Manwood]], cites these beasts of warren:&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.mac.com/calhounabode/josh/TheText.htm Treatise, I:3]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The beasts and fouls of Warren are these, The Hare, the Cony, the Pheasant, and the Partridge, and none other are accompted beasts or fouls of Warren."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Manwood is mistaken in his assignments, since the [[roe deer]] was transferred to "beast of warren" from "beast of the forest" in the fourteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;The roe ceased to be a beast of forest in the fourteenth century owing to a decision in the Court of King's Bench, 13 Edw. III, which decided that it was a beast of warren on the ground that it drove away the other deer (Turner, Select Pleas of the Forest (Selden Soc.),  xxi). [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22180. 'Sport, ancient and modern: Introduction', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 2: General; Ashford,  East Bedfont with Hatton, Feltham, Hampton with Hampton Wick, Hanworth, Laleham, Littleton (1911), pp. 253-58, Note 20.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Roe deer are still found within woodlands named "Warren" in contemporary England.  The [[1911 Encyclopedia]] adds roe, woodcock, quail, and rail to Manwood's list.&lt;ref&gt;"Beasts of (free) warren are roe, hare, rabbit, partridge, pheasant, woodcock, quail, rail and heron" {{harv|Craies|1911a|p=441}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, [[grouse]] are not birds of warren.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animallaw.info/historical/articles/arukbacongame1856.htm] Matthew Bacon’s ''[[Bacon's Abridgement|A New Abridgment of the Law]]'', (1778): Devonshire v. Lodge, 7 Barn. &amp; C. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fox, wolf, cat, badger, and squirrel are sometimes also added.&lt;ref&gt;//www.hants.org.uk/newforest/history/history1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes domestic swine are mistakenly thought to be beasts of warren, due the right of [[pannage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/b/beeton/isabella/household//chapter17.html The Book of Household Management, by Isabella Beeton (chapter17)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

To be '''hanged, drawn and quartered''' was [[Treason Act 1351|from 1352]] a [[statutory]] penalty in England for men convicted of [[high treason]], although the ritual was first recorded during the reign of [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] (1216–1272). A convicted traitor was fastened to a [[hurdle]], or wooden panel, and drawn by horse to the place of execution, where he was then [[hanged]] (almost to the point of death), [[emasculation|emasculated]], [[disembowelment|disembowelled]], [[decapitation|beheaded]], and [[Dismemberment|quartered]] (chopped into four pieces). The traitor's remains were often displayed in prominent places across the country, such as [[London Bridge]].  For reasons of public decency, women convicted of high treason were instead [[Burning of women in England|burned at the stake]].

The severity of the sentence was [[Retributive justice|measured against the seriousness of the crime]]. As an attack on the monarch's authority, high treason was considered a deplorable act demanding the most extreme form of punishment. Although some convicts had their sentences modified and suffered a less ignominious end, over a period of several hundred years many men found guilty of high treason were subjected to the law's ultimate sanction. They included many English [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priests executed during the [[Elizabethan era]], and several of the [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicides involved in the 1649 execution of Charles I]].

Although the [[Act of Parliament]] defining high treason remains on the United Kingdom's statute books, during a long period of 19th-century legal reform the sentence of hanging, drawing, and quartering was changed to drawing, hanging until dead, and posthumous beheading and quartering, before being abolished in England [[Forfeiture Act 1870|in 1870]]. The death penalty for treason was abolished [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998|in 1998]].

==Treason in England==
[[Image:Drawing of William de Marisco.jpg|right|thumb|300px|As illustrated in [[Matthew Paris]]'s ''[[Chronica Majora]]'', [[William de Marisco]] is drawn to his execution behind a horse.]]
During the [[High Middle Ages]] those in England guilty of treason were punished in a variety of ways, including drawing and hanging.  In the 13th century other, more brutal penalties were introduced, such as disembowelling, burning, beheading and quartering.  The 13th-century English chronicler [[Matthew Paris]] described how in 1238 "a certain man at arms, a man of some education (''armiger literatus'')"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Powicke|1949|pp=54–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to kill [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]].  His account records in gruesome detail how the would-be assassin was executed: "dragged asunder, then beheaded, and his body divided into three parts; each part was then dragged through one of the principal cities of England, and was afterwards hung on a gibbet used for robbers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Giles|1852|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|"''&lt;!-- Quo cognito --&gt;Rex eum, quasi regiae majestatis (occisorem), membratim laniatum equis apud Coventre, exemplum terribile et spectaculum comentabile praebere (iussit) omnibus audentibus talia machinari.  Primo enim distractus, postea decollatus et corpus in tres partes divisum est.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|2004|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  He was apparently sent by [[William de Marisco]], an outlaw who some years earlier had killed a man under royal protection before fleeing to [[Lundy Island]].  De Marisco was captured in 1242 and on Henry's order dragged from Westminster to the [[Tower of London]] to be executed.  There he was hanged from a [[gibbet]] until dead.  His corpse was disembowelled, his entrails burned, his body quartered and the parts distributed to cities across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|Paris|1987|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The punishment is more frequently recorded during [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]'s reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Diehl|Donnelly|2009|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Welsh people|Welshman]] [[Dafydd ap Gruffydd]] became the first nobleman in England to be hanged, drawn, and quartered after he turned against the king and proclaimed himself [[Prince of Wales]] and Lord of Snowdon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beadle|Harrison|2008|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dafydd's rebellion infuriated Edward so much that he demanded a novel punishment.  Therefore, following his capture and trial in 1283, for his betrayal he was drawn by horse to his place of execution.  For killing English nobles he was hanged alive.  For killing those nobles at Easter he was eviscerated and his entrails burned. For conspiring to kill the king in various parts of the realm, his body was quartered and the parts sent across the country; his head was placed on top of the [[Tower of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|2004|pp=23–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar fate was suffered by the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] leader [[William Wallace|Sir William Wallace]].  Captured and tried in 1305,&lt;!-- this date not cited but uncontroversial, in fact it's in Bellamy 2004 p29 --&gt; he was forced to wear a crown of laurel leaves and was drawn to [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]], where he was hanged and beheaded.  His entrails were then burned and his corpse quartered.  His head was set on [[London Bridge]] and the quarters sent to [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]], [[Stirling]], and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Murison|2003|pp=147–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Patrick Wormald wrote, "if anyone plots against the king's life ... [''or'' his lord's life], he is liable for his life and all that he owns ... or to clear himself by the king's [lord's] wergeld."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wormald|2001|pp=280–281}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Treason was based on an allegiance to the sovereign from all subjects aged&amp;nbsp;14 or over and it remained for the king and his judges to determine whether that allegiance had been broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tanner|1940|p=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]'s justices had offered somewhat over-zealous interpretations of what activities constituted treason, "calling felonies treasons and afforcing indictments by talk of accroachment of the royal power",&lt;ref name="Bellamyp9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting parliamentary demands to clarify the law.  Edward therefore introduced the [[Treason Act 1351]].  It was enacted at a time in English history when a monarch's right to rule was indisputable and was therefore written principally to protect the throne and sovereign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tanner|1940|pp=375–376}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new law offered a narrower definition of treason than had existed before and split the old feudal offence into two classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|pp=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubber|2005|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Petty treason]] referred to the killing of a master (or lord) by his servant, a husband by his wife, or a prelate by his clergyman.  Men guilty of petty treason were drawn and hanged, whereas women were [[Burning of women in England|burned]].{{refn|group="nb"|Women were considered the legal property of their husbands,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|Sluga|2002|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so a woman convicted of killing her husband was guilty not of murder, but petty treason.  For disrupting the social order a degree of retribution was therefore required; hanging was considered insufficient for such a heinous crime.&lt;ref name="Briggsp84"/&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blackstone et al.|1832|pp=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[High treason in the United Kingdom|High treason]] was the most egregious offence an individual could commit.  Attempts to undermine the king's authority were viewed with as much seriousness as if the accused had attacked him personally, which itself would be an assault on his status as sovereign and a direct threat to his right to govern.  As this might undermine the state, retribution was considered an absolute necessity and the crime deserving of the ultimate punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Foucault|1995|pp=47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The practical difference between the two offences therefore was in the consequence of being convicted; rather than being drawn and hanged, men were to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, while for reasons of public decency (their anatomy being considered inappropriate for the sentence), women were instead drawn and burned.&lt;ref name="Briggsp84"&gt;{{Harvnb|Briggs|1996|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Naishp9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Naish|1991|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act declared that a person had committed high treason if they were: compassing or imagining the death of the king, his wife or his eldest son and heir; violating the king's wife, his eldest daughter if she were unmarried, or the wife of his eldest son and heir; levying war against the king in his [[realm]]; adhering to the king's enemies in his realm, giving them aid and comfort in his realm or elsewhere; counterfeiting the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] or the [[Privy Seal]], or the king's coinage; knowingly importing counterfeit money; killing the [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor]], [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] or one of the king's Justices while performing their offices.&lt;ref name="Bellamyp9"/&gt;  The Act did not limit the king's authority in defining the scope of treason.  It contained a proviso giving English judges discretion to extend that scope whenever required, a process more commonly known as [[constructive treason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group="nb"|"And because that many other like cases of treason may happen in time to come, which a man cannot think nor declare at this present time; it is accorded, that if any other case supposed treason, which is not above specified, doth happen before any justice, the justice shall tarry without going to judgement of treason, till the cause be shewed and declared before the king and his parliament, whether it ought to be judged treason or other felony." [[Edward Coke]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coke|Littleton|Hargrave|1817|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  It also applied to subjects overseas in [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonies in the Americas]], but the only documented incident of an individual there being hanged, drawn, and quartered was that of Joshua Tefft, an English colonist accused of having fought on the side of the [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] during the [[Great Swamp Fight]].  He was executed in January 1676.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Anthony |first=A. Craig |title=Local Historian Examines the Execution of Joshua Tefft at Smith's Castle in 1676 |journal=Castle Chronicle |year=2001 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=1, 8–9 |url=http://www.smithscastle.org/whats_new/Castle_chron/castle_chron_w01.pdf |accessdate=20 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321053412/http://www.smithscastle.org/whats_new/Castle_chron/castle_chron_w01.pdf |archivedate=21 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later sentences resulted either in a pardon or a hanging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ward|2009|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one witness was required to convict a person of treason, although in 1547 this was increased to two.  Suspects were first questioned in private by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] before they were publicly tried.  They were allowed no witnesses or defence [[counsel]], and were generally presumed guilty from the outset.  This meant that for centuries anyone accused of treason was severely legally disadvantaged, a situation which lasted until the late 17th century, when several years of politically motivated treason charges made against [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] politicians prompted the introduction of the [[Treason Act 1695]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tomkovicz|2002|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allowed a defendant counsel, witnesses, a copy of the indictment, and a jury, and when not charged with an attempt on the monarch's life, to be prosecuted within three years of the alleged offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Feilden|2009|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham]] was executed on 17 May 1521 for the crime of treason. The wording of his sentence has survived and indicates the precision with which the method of execution was described;  he was to be "laid on a hurdle and so drawn to the place of execution, and there to be hanged, cut down alive, your members to be cut off and cast in the fire, your bowels burnt before you, your head smitten off, and your body quartered and divided at the King's will, and God have mercy on your soul."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Lacey, B. (1954) ''English Treason Trials and Confessions in the Sixteenth Century'', Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 15, No. 4 (Oct., 1954), pp. 471-498 Published by: University of Pennsylvania Press, p. 484.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Execution of the sentence==
{{See also|List of people hanged, drawn and quartered}}
Once sentenced, malefactors were usually held in prison for a few days before being taken to the place of execution. During the early Middle Ages this journey may have been made tied directly to the back of a horse, but it subsequently became customary for the victim to be fastened instead to a wicker [[hurdle]], or wooden panel, itself tied to the horse.&lt;ref name="Bellamyp187"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian [[Frederic William Maitland]] thought that this was probably to "[secure] for the hangman a yet living body".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pollock|Maitland|2007|p=500}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of the word drawn, as in "to draw", has caused a degree of confusion.  One of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|Oxford English Dictionary's]]'' definitions of draw is "to draw out the viscera or intestines of; to disembowel (a fowl, etc. before cooking, a traitor or other criminal after hanging)", but this is followed by "in many cases of executions it is uncertain whether this, or [to drag (a criminal) at a horse's tail, or on a hurdle or the like, to the place of execution; formerly a legal punishment of high treason], is meant. The presumption is that where ''drawn'' is mentioned after ''hanged'', the sense is as here."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = draw | title = Oxford English Dictionary | url = http://dictionary.oed.com/ | publisher = Oxford University Press, hosted at dictionary.oed.com | edition = 2 | year = 1989 | accessdate = 18 August 2010 | postscript = . | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060625103623/http://dictionary.oed.com/ | archivedate = 25 June 2006 | df = dmy-all }} {{OEDsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian [[Ram Sharan Sharma]] arrived at the same conclusion: "Where, as in the popular ''hung, drawn and quartered'' [use] (meaning facetiously, of a person, completely disposed of), ''drawn'' follows ''hanged'' or ''hung'', it is to be referred to as the disembowelling of the traitor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sharma|2003|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The historian and author [[Ian Mortimer (historian)|Ian Mortimer]] disagrees.  In an essay published on his website, he writes that the separate mention of evisceration is a relatively modern device, and that while it certainly took place on many occasions, the presumption that ''drawing'' means to disembowel is spurious.  Instead, drawing (as a method of transportation) may be mentioned after hanging because it was a supplementary part of the execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Mortimer | first = Ian | title = Why do we say 'hanged, drawn and quartered?' | url = http://www.ianmortimer.com/essays/drawing.pdf | publisher = ianmortimer.com | date = 30 March 2010 | accessdate = 20 August 2010 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101122022519/http://www.ianmortimer.com/essays/drawing.pdf | archivedate = 22 November 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reports indicate that during [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary&amp;nbsp;I]]'s reign bystanders were vocal in their support: while in transit convicts sometimes suffered directly at the hands of the crowd. [[William Wallace]] was whipped, attacked and had rotten food and waste thrown at him,&lt;ref name="BeadleHarrisonp12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Beadle|Harrison|2008|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the priest [[Thomas Pilchard]] was reportedly barely alive by the time he reached the gallows in 1587.  Others found themselves admonished by "zealous and godly men";&lt;ref name="Bellamyp187"/&gt; it became customary for a preacher to follow the condemned, asking them to repent.  According to [[Samuel Clarke]], the [[Puritan]] clergyman [[William Perkins (Puritan)|William Perkins]] (1558–1602) once managed to convince a young man at the gallows that he had been forgiven, enabling the youth to go to his death "with tears of joy in his eyes&amp;nbsp;... as if he actually saw himself delivered from the hell which he feared before, and heaven opened for receiving his soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke|1654|p=853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the king's commission had been read aloud, the crowd was normally asked to move back from the scaffold before being addressed by the convict.&lt;ref name="Bellamyp191"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While these speeches were mostly an admission of guilt (although few admitted treason),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; still they were carefully monitored by the sheriff and chaplain, who were occasionally forced to act; in 1588, Catholic priest [[William Dean (priest)|William Dean]]'s address to the crowd was considered so inappropriate that he was gagged almost to the point of suffocation.&lt;ref name="Bellamyp191"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pollen|1908|p=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questions on matters of allegiance and politics were sometimes put to the prisoner,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; as happened to [[Edmund Gennings]] in 1591. He was asked by [[priest hunter]] [[Richard Topcliffe]] to "confess his treason", but when Gennings responded "if to say Mass be treason, I confess to have done it and glory in it", Topcliffe ordered him to be quiet and instructed the hangman to push him off the ladder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pollen|1908|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes the witness responsible for the condemned man's execution was also present.  A government spy, John Munday, was in 1582 present for the execution of [[Thomas Ford (martyr)|Thomas Ford]]. Munday supported the sheriff, who had reminded the priest of his confession when he protested his innocence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sentiments expressed in such speeches may be related to the conditions encountered during imprisonment. Many Jesuit priests suffered badly at the hands of their captors but were frequently the most defiant; conversely, those of a higher station were often the most apologetic. Such contrition may have arisen from the sheer terror felt by those who thought they might be disembowelled rather than simply beheaded as they would normally expect, and any apparent acceptance of their fate may have stemmed from the belief that a serious, but not treasonable act, had been committed. Good behaviour at the gallows may also have been due to a convict's desire for his heirs not to be disinherited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The condemned were occasionally forced to watch as other traitors, sometimes their confederates, were executed before them.  The priest [[James Bell (priest)|James Bell]] was in 1584 made to watch as his companion, [[John Finch (martyr)|John Finch]], was "a-quarter-inge".  [[Edward James (martyr)|Edward James]] and Francis Edwardes were made to witness [[Ralph Crockett]]'s execution in 1588, in an effort to elicit their co-operation and acceptance of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s religious supremacy before they were themselves executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Normally stripped to the shirt with their arms bound in front of them, prisoners were then hanged for a short period, either from a ladder or cart.  On the sheriff's orders the cart would be taken away (or if a ladder, turned), leaving the man suspended in mid-air.  The aim was usually to cause [[strangulation]] and near-death, although some victims were killed prematurely, the priest [[John Payne (martyr)|John Payne]]'s death in 1582 being hastened by a group of men pulling on his legs.  Conversely, some, such as the deeply unpopular [[William Hacket]] (d. 1591), were cut down instantly and taken to be disembowelled and normally [[emasculated]]—the latter, according to Sir [[Edward Coke]], to "show his issue was disinherited with corruption of blood."{{refn|group="nb"|For an explanation of "corruption of blood", see [[Attainder]].}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|pp=202–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Though many say that the disembowelling involved the criminal being slit open from the breastbone down, Geoffrey Robertson &lt;ref&gt;(2005) ''The Tyrannicide Brief'', London  Chatto &amp; Windus&lt;/ref&gt; shows photographs of the screw irons used, he states, to 'draw' the entrails through the anus, the opening having been first cut open it more than natural. This was the method used at the hanging, drawing and quartering of John Cooke, the prosecutor at Charles I's trial, and other regicides at the Restoration. --&gt;
A victim still conscious at that point might have seen his entrails burned, before his heart was removed and the body decapitated and quartered (chopped into four pieces).  The [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicide]] [[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Major-General Thomas Harrison]], after being hanged for several minutes and then cut open in October 1660, was reported to have leaned across and hit his executioner—resulting in the swift removal of his head.

He speculates that the reasoning behind such bloody displays may have been to assuage the crowd's anger, to remove any human characteristics from the corpse, to rob the criminal's family of any opportunity to hold a meaningful funeral, or even to release any evil spirits contained within.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kastenbaum|2004|pp=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice of disembowelling the body may have originated in the medieval belief that treasonable thoughts were housed there, requiring that the convict's entrails be "purged by fire".&lt;ref name="Bellamyp204"/&gt;  [[Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle|Andrew Harclay]]'s "treasonous thoughts had originated in his 'heart, bowels, and entrails'", and so were to be "extracted and burnt to ashes, which would then be dispersed", as had happened with William Wallace and [[Gilbert de Middleton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Westerhof|2008|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  At his execution in January 1606 for his involvement in the [[Gunpowder Plot]], [[Guy Fawkes]] managed to break his neck by jumping from the gallows, cheating the executioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|pp=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No records exist to demonstrate exactly how the corpse was quartered, although an engraving of the quartering of [[Sir Thomas Armstrong]] in 1684 shows the executioner making vertical cuts through the spine and removing the legs at the hip.{{sfn|Lewis|2008|pp=113–124|ps=}} The distribution of [[Dafydd ap Gruffydd]]'s remains was described by [[Sir Herbert Maxwell, 7th Baronet|Herbert Maxwell]]: "the right arm with a ring on the finger in York; the left arm in Bristol; the right leg and hip at Northampton; the left [leg] at Hereford.  But the villain's head was bound with iron, lest it should fall to pieces from putrefaction, and set conspicuously upon a long spear-shaft for the mockery of London."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|1913|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the execution in 1660 of several of the regicides involved in the death of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] eleven years earlier, the diarist [[John Evelyn]] remarked: "I saw not their execution, but met their quarters, mangled, and cut, and reeking, as they were brought from the gallows in baskets on the hurdle."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evelyn|1850|p=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such remains were typically [[parboiled]] and displayed as a gruesome reminder of the penalty for high treason, usually wherever the traitor had conspired or found support.&lt;ref name="Abbottpp158159"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|pp=207–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Salt and [[cumin]] seed would be added during the boiling process: the salt to prevent putrefaction, and the cumin seed to prevent birds pecking at the flesh.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, C. ''Outlines of Criminal Law'' (Cambridge University Press, 1936), 15th edition, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt;

The head was often displayed on [[London Bridge]], for centuries the route by which many travellers from the south entered the city.  Several eminent commentators remarked on the displays.  In 1566 [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] wrote that "in London there were many heads on the bridge&amp;nbsp;... I have seen there, as if they were masts of ships, and at the top of them, quarters of men's corpses."  In 1602 the [[Barnim X, Duke of Pomerania|Duke of Pommerania-Stettin]] emphasised the ominous nature of their presence when he wrote "near the end of the bridge, on the suburb side, were stuck up the heads of thirty gentlemen of high standing who had been beheaded on account of treason and secret practices against the Queen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Abbott|2005|pp=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group="nb"|In 1534, a woman's head adorned the bridge; [[Elizabeth Barton]], a domestic servant and later [[nun]] who forecast the early death of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], was drawn to [[Tyburn]], and hanged and beheaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Abbott|2005|pp=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  The practice of using London Bridge in this manner ended following the hanging, drawing, and quartering in 1678 of William Staley, a victim of the fictitious [[Popish Plot]].  His quarters were given to his relatives, who promptly arranged a "grand" funeral; this incensed the coroner so much that he ordered the body to be dug up and set upon the city gates.  Staley's was the last head to be placed on London Bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beadle|Harrison|2008|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Seccombe | first1 = Thomas | last2 = Carr | first2 = Sarah | title = Staley, William (d. 1678) | work = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher = Oxford University Press, hosted at oxforddnb.com | year = 2004 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26224 | accessdate = 17 August 2010 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/26224}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later history==
Another victim of the Popish Plot, [[Oliver Plunkett]] the [[Archbishop of Armagh]], was hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn in July 1681.  His executioner was bribed so that Plunket's body parts were saved from the fire; the head is now displayed at [[St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, Drogheda|St Peter's Church in Drogheda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hanly | first = John | title = Plunket, Oliver &lt;nowiki&gt;[St Oliver Plunket]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1625–1681) | volume = 1 | work = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher = Oxford University Press, hosted at oxforddnb.com | origyear = 2004 | year = 2006 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22412 | accessdate = 17 Aug 2010 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/22412}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Francis Towneley]] and several other captured [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] officers involved in the [[Jacobite Rising of 1745]] were executed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by then the executioner possessed some discretion as to how much they should suffer and thus they were killed before their bodies were eviscerated.  The French spy [[François Henri de la Motte]] was hanged in 1781 for almost an hour before his heart was cut out and burned,&lt;ref name="Gatrellp317"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gatrell|1996|pp=316–317}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the following year David Tyrie was hanged, decapitated, and then quartered at Portsmouth.  Pieces of his corpse were fought over by members of the 20,000-strong crowd there, some making trophies of his limbs and fingers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Poole|2000|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1803 [[Edward Despard]] and six co-conspirators in the [[Despard Plot]] were sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered.  Before they were hanged and beheaded at [[Horsemonger Lane Gaol]], they were first placed on sledges attached to horses, and ritually pulled in circuits around the gaol yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gatrell|1996|pp=317–318}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their execution was attended by an audience of about&amp;nbsp;20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Chase | first = Malcolm | title = Despard, Edward Marcus (1751–1803) | work = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher = Oxford University Press, hosted at oxforddnb.com | origyear = 2004 | year = 2009 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7548 | accessdate = 19 August 2010 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/7548 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924161846/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7548 | archivedate = 24 September 2015 | df = dmy-all }} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A contemporary report describes the scene after Despard had made his speech:

{{Quote | This energetic, but inflammatory appeal, was followed by such enthusiastic plaudits, that the Sheriff hinted to the Clergyman to withdraw, and forbade Colonel Despard to proceed.  The cap was then drawn over their eyes, during which the Colonel was observed again to fix the knot under his left ear, and, at seven minutes before nine o'clock the signal being given, the platform dropped, and they were all launched into eternity.  From the precaution taken by the Colonel, he appeared to suffer very little, neither did the others struggle much, except Broughton, who had been the most indecently profane of the whole. Wood, the soldier, died very hard.  The Executioners went under, and kept pulling them by the feet. Several drops of blood fell from the fingers of Macnamara and Wood, during the time they were suspended.  After hanging thirty-seven minutes, the Colonel's body was cut down, at half an hour past nine o'clock, and being stripped of his coat and waistcoat, it was laid upon saw-dust, with the head reclined upon a block.  A surgeon then in attempting to sever the head from the body by a common dissecting knife, missed the particular joint aimed at, when he kept haggling it, till the executioner was obliged to take the head between his hands, and to twist it several times round, when it was with difficulty severed from the body.  It was then held up by the executioner, who exclaimed—"''Behold the head of EDWARD MARCUS DESPARD, a Traitor!''"  The same ceremony followed with the others respectively; and the whole concluded by ten o'clock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Granger|Caulfield|1804|pp=889–897}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Jeremiah Brandreths head.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The severed head of [[Jeremiah Brandreth]], one of the last men in England sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered]]
At the burnings of Isabella Condon in 1779 and Phoebe Harris in 1786, the sheriffs present inflated their expenses; in the opinion of Simon Devereaux they were probably dismayed at being forced to attend such spectacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Devereaux|2006|pp=73–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Harris's fate prompted [[William Wilberforce]] to sponsor a bill which if passed would have abolished the practice, but as one of its proposals would have allowed the [[Body snatching|anatomical dissection]] of criminals other than murderers, the [[House of Lords]] rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1996|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The burning in 1789 of [[Catherine Murphy (counterfeiter)|Catherine Murphy]], a counterfeiter,{{refn|group="nb"|Although women were usually burned only after they had first been strangled to death, in 1726 [[Catherine Hayes (murderer)|Catherine Hayes]]'s executioner botched the job and she perished in the flames, the last woman in England to do so.&lt;ref name="Gatrellp317"/&gt;}} was impugned in Parliament by Sir Benjamin Hammett.  He called it one of "the savage remains of Norman policy".&lt;ref name="Gatrellp317" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shelton|2009|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst a growing tide of public disgust at the burning of women, Parliament passed the [[Treason Act 1790]], which for women guilty of treason substituted hanging for burning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Feilden|2009|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was followed by the [[Treason Act 1814]], introduced by [[Samuel Romilly]], a legal reformer.  Influenced by his friend, [[Jeremy Bentham]], Romilly had long argued that punitive laws should serve to reform criminal behaviour and that far from acting as a deterrent, the [[Bloody Code|severity of England's laws]] was responsible for an increase in crime.  When appointed the MP for Queensborough in 1806 he resolved to improve what he described as "Our sanguinary and barbarous penal code, written in blood".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Block|Hostettler|1997|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; He managed to repeal the death penalty for certain thefts and vagrancy,&lt;!-- this cited to previous citation, block/hostettler, no need for two cites so close together --&gt; and [[Treason Act 1814|in 1814]] proposed to change the sentence for men guilty of treason to being hanged until dead and the body left at the king's disposal.  However, when it was pointed out that this would be a less severe punishment than that given for murder, he agreed that the corpse should also be decapitated, "as a fit punishment and appropriate stigma."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Romilly|1820|p=xlvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joycep105"&gt;{{Harvnb|Joyce|1955|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is what happened to [[Jeremiah Brandreth]], leader of a 100-strong contingent of men in the [[Pentrich rising]] and one of three men executed in 1817 at [[Derby Gaol]].  As with Edward Despard and his confederates&lt;!-- see Gatrell pp317-318 --&gt; the three were drawn to the scaffold on sledges before being hanged for about an hour, and then on the insistence of the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] were beheaded with an axe.  The local miner appointed to the task of beheading them was inexperienced though, and having failed with the first two blows, completed his job with a knife.  As he held the first head up and made the customary announcement, the crowd reacted with horror and fled.  A different reaction was seen in 1820, when amidst more social unrest five men involved in the [[Cato Street Conspiracy]] were hanged and beheaded at Newgate Prison.  Although the beheading was performed by a surgeon, following the usual proclamation the crowd was angry enough to force the executioners to find safety behind the prison walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Belchem | first = John | title = Brandreth, Jeremiah (1786/1790–1817) | volume = 1 | work = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher = Oxford University Press, hosted at oxforddnb.com | origyear = 2004 | year = 2008 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3270 | accessdate = 19 August 2010 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/3270}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plot was the last  crime for which the sentence was applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Abbott|2005|pp=161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reformation of England's capital punishment laws continued throughout the 19th century, as politicians such as [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell]], sought to remove from the statute books many of the capital offences that remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Block|Hostettler|1997|pp=51–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Robert Peel]]'s drive to ameliorate law enforcement saw petty treason abolished by the [[Offences against the Person Act 1828]], which removed the distinction between crimes formerly considered as petty treason, and murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wiener|2004|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubber|2005|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Royal Commission on Capital Punishment 1864-1866]] recommended that there be no change to treason law, quoting the "more merciful" [[Treason Felony Act 1848]], which limited the punishment for most treasonous acts to [[penal servitude]].  Its report recommended that for "rebellion, assassination or other violence&amp;nbsp;...we are of opinion that the extreme penalty must remain",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Levi|1866|pp=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the most recent occasion (and ultimately, the last) on which anyone had been sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered was in November 1839, following the [[Chartism|Chartist]] [[Newport Rising]]—and those men sentenced to death were instead [[penal transportation|transported]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chase|2007|pp=137–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report highlighted the changing public mood toward public executions (brought about in part by the growing prosperity created by the [[Industrial Revolution]]).  [[Home Secretary]] [[Spencer Horatio Walpole]] told the commission that executions had "become so demoralizing that, instead of its having a good effect, it has a tendency rather to brutalize the public mind than to deter the criminal class from committing crime".  The commission recommended that executions should be performed privately, behind prison walls and away from the public's view, "under such regulations as may be considered necessary to prevent abuse, and to satisfy the public that the law has been complied with."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McConville|1995|p=409}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice of executing murderers in public was ended two years later by the [[Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868]], introduced by Home Secretary [[Gathorne Hardy]], but this did not apply to traitors.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt;  An amendment to abolish capital punishment completely, suggested before the bill's third reading, failed by 127&amp;nbsp;votes to&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gatrell|1996|p=593}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Block|Hostettler|1997|pp=59,&amp;nbsp;72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United States==
In some of the places where the [[American War of Independence]] developed into a fierce civil war among American factions, there are recorded cases of both sides resorting to hanging, drawing, and quartering - both Loyalists and Patriots finding reasons to construe their opponents as being "traitors" deserving of such a fate.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Allen.

In: Keith Michael Baker and Dan Edelstein (eds.). ''Scripting Revolution: A Historical Approach to the Comparative Study of Revolutions''. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2015. According to Armitage, "The renaming can happen relatively quickly: for example, the transatlantic conflict of the 1770s that many contemporaries saw as a British "civil war" or even "the American Civil War" was first called "the American evolution" in 1776 by the chief justice of South Carolina, [[William Henry Drayton]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]'s prohibition of "[[Cruel and Unusual Punishment]]s" clearly (and successfully) aimed at preventing any further such usage on American soil.

{{refimprove|date=December 2016}}
The '''history of ideas''' is a field of [[research]] in [[history]] that deals with the expression, preservation, and change of human [[idea]]s over time.  The history of ideas is a sister-discipline to, or a particular approach within, [[intellectual history]].  Work in the history of ideas may involve interdisciplinary research in the [[history of philosophy]], the [[history of science]], or the [[history of literature]]. In [[Sweden]], the history of ideas and science or [[Swedish history of ideas|''Idé- och lärdomshistoria'']] has been a distinct university subject since 6 November 1932, when [[Johan Nordström]], a scholar of literature, was appointed professor of the new discipline in a ceremony at [[Uppsala University]] (coinciding with that commemorating the 300-year anniversary of the [[Battle of Lützen (1632)|Battle of Lützen]]). Today, several universities across the world provide courses in this field, usually as part of a graduate programme.

==The Lovejoy approach==
The historian [[Arthur O. Lovejoy]] (1873–1962) coined the phrase ''history of ideas''{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} and initiated its systematic study&lt;ref name=greatchain&gt;Arthur Lovejoy: ''The Great Chain of Being: A Study of the History of an Idea'' (1936), {{ISBN|0-674-36153-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the early decades of the 20th century. [[Johns Hopkins University]] was a "fertile cradle" to Lovejoy's history of ideas;&lt;ref name="Paulson1970"&gt;[[Ronald Paulson]] [https://www.jstor.org/pss/468272 ''English Literary History at the Johns Hopkins University''] in ''New Literary History'', Vol. 1, No. 3, History and Fiction (Spring, 1970), pp. 559–564&lt;/ref&gt; he worked there as a professor of history, from 1910 to 1939, and for decades he presided over the regular meetings of the ''History of Ideas Club''.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Lovejoy, ''Essays in the History of Ideas,'' {{ISBN|0-313-20504-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another outgrowth of his work is the ''[[Journal of the History of Ideas]]''.

Aside from his students and colleagues engaged in related projects (such as [[René Wellek]] and [[Leo Spitzer]], with whom Lovejoy engaged in extended debates), scholars such as [[Isaiah Berlin]],&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, ''Against the Current: Essays in the History of Ideas'', {{ISBN|0-691-09026-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Foucault]], [[John Edward Christopher Hill|Christopher Hill]], [[J. G. A. Pocock]], and others have continued to work in a spirit close to that with which Lovejoy pursued the history of ideas.  The first chapter of Lovejoy's book ''The Great Chain of Being'' (1936) lays out a general overview of what he intended to be the programme and scope of the study of the history of ideas.&lt;ref name=greatchain/&gt;

==Unit-ideas==
Lovejoy's history of ideas takes as its basic unit of analysis the unit-idea, or the individual concept.  These unit-ideas work as the building-blocks of the history of ideas: though they are relatively unchanged in themselves over the course of time, unit-ideas recombine in new patterns and gain expression in new forms in different historical eras.  As Lovejoy saw it, the historian of ideas had the task of identifying such unit-ideas and of describing their historical emergence and recession in new forms and combinations.

The unit-idea methodology, intended to extract the basic idea within any philosophical work and movement,&lt;ref name="greatchain"/&gt; also has certain defining principles: 1) assumptions, 2) dialectical motives, 3) metaphysical pathos, and 4) philosophical semantics. These different principles define the overarching philosophical movement within which, Lovejoy argues, one can find the unit-idea, which can then be studied throughout the history of that idea.

==Modern work==

[[Quentin Skinner]] criticizes Lovejoy's "unit-idea" methodology, and he argues that such a "reification of doctrines" has negative consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Quentin Skinner (1969). "Meaning and Understanding in the History of Ideas". ''History and Ideas'' '''8''' (1): 3–53.&lt;/ref&gt;  He emphasizes sensitivity to the cultural context of the texts and ideas being analysed. Skinner's own [[historical method]]ology is based on [[J.L. Austin]]'s theory of speech acts. [[Andreas Dorschel]] criticizes Skinner's restrictive approach to ideas through verbal language, and points out how ideas can materialize in non-linguistic media or genres such as music and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Dorschel, ''Ideengeschichte.'' Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht,  2010. {{ISBN|978-3-8252-3314-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important development within the study of ideas has been within the academic discipline of [[Intellectual History]]. The [[Harvard]] historian [[Peter Gordon (historian)|Peter Gordon]] explains that intellectual history, as opposed to the history of ideas practiced by Lovejoy, studies and deals with ideas within a broader context.&lt;ref name="history.fas.harvard.edu"&gt;Peter E. Gordon, [http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/history/files/what_is_intell_history_pgordon_mar2012.pdf "What is intellectual history? A frankly partisan introduction to a frequently misunderstood field"]. Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon further emphasises that intellectual historians, as opposed to historians of ideas and philosophers ([[History of Philosophy]]), "tend to be more relaxed about crossing the boundary between philosophical texts and non-philosophical contexts...[they regard] the distinction between "philosophy" and "non-philosophy" as something that is itself historically conditioned rather than eternally fixed."&lt;ref name="history.fas.harvard.edu"/&gt; Therefore, intellectual history, as a means of reproducing a historically valid interpretation of a philosophical argument, tends to implement a contextualist approach when studying ideas and broader philosophical movements.

==Foucault's approach==
{{see also|Genealogy (philosophy)|The Archaeology of Knowledge}}

[[Michel Foucault]] rejects the idea of the traditional way historians go about writing, which is a narrative. He believed that most historians preferred to write about long periods of time instead of digging deeper into a more specific history.&lt;ref&gt;Felluga, Dino. [http://www.purdue.edu/guidetotheory/newhistoricism/modules/foucaulthistory.html "Modules on Foucault: On History"]. Introductory Guide to Critical Theory.&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault argues that historians should reveal historical descriptions through different perspectives. This is where he comes up with the term “archaeology” for his method of historical writing. His historical method differs from the traditional sense of historical writing and is divided up into four different ideas.

The first is that "archaeology" seeks to define the history through philosophical means, which is to say the discourse between thought, representation, and themes. The second is that, in "archaeology," the notion of discontinuity assumes a major role in the historical disciplines. The third idea is that "archaeology" does not seek to grasp the moment in history at which the individual and the social are inverted into one another. And finally the fourth point is that "archaeology" does not seek the truth of history, rather it seeks the discourse in it.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. [https://foucault.info/doc/documents/archaeologyofknowledge/foucault-archaeologyofknowledge-00-intro-html "Archaeology Of Knowledge, Introduction"], edited by A. M. Sherida Smith. Vintage, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4355">The '''history of scholarship''' is the historical study of [[fields of study]] which are not covered by the English term "science" (cf., [[history of science]]), but are covered by, for example, the German term "[[Wissenschaft]]" (i.e., all kinds of academic studies). Examples are the history of classical studies, the history of the study of religions, of philosophy, of Biblical studies, of historiography, of the study of music, arts etc. It is a field which has recently undergone a complete renewal and is now a major branch of research.&lt;ref&gt;Ligota, C.

Rudolph Pfeiffer (1968)&lt;ref&gt;Pfeiffer, Rudolph (1968). History of Classical Scholarship: From the Beginnings to the End of the Hellenistic Age.  Oxford University Press. (Oxford University Press academic monograph reprints). &lt;/ref&gt; describes the history of classical scholarship from its revival inspired by Petrarch to the achievements of the Italian humanists and the idependent movement in Holland (including Erasmus) and the German scholar-reformers. Pfeiffer traces the development of classical scholarship in the countries of Western Europe through the next two Centuries, with particular attention to sixteenth-century France and eighteenth-century England. Finally he provides an account of the new approach made by Winckelmann and his successors in Germany.

==Philosophers, scholars, polymaths, and scientists==
The word [[scientist]] was coined by the English philosopher and historian of science [[William Whewell]] in 1833.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Until then there was no differentiation between the [[history of science]], the [[history of philosophy]] and the history of scholarship. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Before 1700 the fields of scholarship were not of a size that made academic specialisation necessary.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} [[Academic discipline]]s as we know them today did not exist.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} In general scholars were both scientists and scholars in what today is termed [[Arts]] and [[Humanities]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31087">'''Implicit self-esteem''' refers to a person's disposition to evaluate themselves in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. It contrasts with ''explicit self-esteem'', which entails more conscious and reflective self-evaluation. Both explicit and implicit self-esteem are constituents of [[self-esteem]].

==Overview==
Implicit self-esteem has been specifically defined as "the introspectively unidentified (or inaccurately identified) effect of the self-attitude on evaluation of self-associated and self-dissociated objects".&lt;ref name="social cognition"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenwald | first1 = A. G. | last2 = Banaji | first2 = M. R. | year = 1995 | title = Implicit social cognition: Attitudes, selfesteem, and stereotypes | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 102 | issue = | pages = 4–27 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.102.1.4 | pmid=7878162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because by definition implicit self-esteem may not be accessible to conscious introspection, measures of implicit do not rely on direct self-reports, but rather infer the valence of associations with the self through other means.

The vast majority of implicit self-esteem measures suggest that an individual's self-evaluation spills over to self-related objects. Also, these measures reveal that people, on average, have positive self-evaluations. The overestimation of one's traits and abilities is argued to be a spillover of positive affect from the self to objects associated with the self.&lt;ref&gt;Farnham, D. S., Greenwald, G. A., &amp; Banaji, M. N. (1999) Implicit self-esteem. In D. Abrams &amp; M. Hogg(Eds.), Social identity and social cognition (pp. 230-248). Oxford, UK: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; This "spillover" is automatic and unconscious. Implicit self-esteem therefore offers an explanation of positivity bias for things related to the self. [[Association (psychology)|Associations]] are especially important; implicit self-esteem is made up of a series of associations between the [[Self (psychology)|self]] and a positive or negative evaluation of the self. This is especially shown in measures of the [[Implicit Association Test]].

==Influencing factors==
Several researchers have suggested that levels of implicit self-esteem can be affected by [[evaluative conditioning]], through pairing of construct of the self with positive or negative stimuli, with the objective of altering attitude towards the self.&lt;ref name="likes and dislikes"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Houwer | first1 = J. | last2 = Thomas | first2 = S. | last3 = Baeyens | first3 = F. | year = 2001 | title = Associative learning of likes and dislikes: A review of 25 years of research on human evaluative conditioning | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 127 | issue = | pages = 853–869 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.127.6.853}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="increasing implicit self-esteem"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baccus | first1 = J.R. | last2 = Baldwin | first2 = M.W. | last3 = Packer | first3 = D.J. | year = 2004 | title = Increasing implicit self-esteem through classical conditioning | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 498–502 | doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00708.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, social comparison, or more specifically the performance of people in one’s close social circle, can also affect implicit self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Nicholls, E. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nicholls | first1 = E. | last2 = Stukas | first2 = A.A. | year = 2011 | title = Narcissism and the self-evaluation maintenance model: Effects of social comparison threats on relationship closeness | url = | journal = The journal of social psychology | volume = 151 | issue = | pages = 201–212 | doi=10.1080/00224540903510852}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information suggests that expectancies of social inclusion is a factor in self-evaluation.

===Evaluative conditioning===
The influence of evaluative conditioning on implicit self-esteem is analogous to the principles of classical conditioning on behavioral responses. Although the latter involves pairing an unconditioned stimulus with a neutral stimulus repeatedly until presence of the neutral stimulus evokes the consequence of the unconditioned stimulus, evaluative conditioning involves pairing positive and negative stimulus with an internal construct- the self- to manipulate levels of implicit self-esteem.

The effectiveness of evaluative conditioning hinges on the understanding that implicit self-esteem is interpersonally associative in nature, and that there is a causal relationship between the self and positive/negative social feedback. Studies have shown that participants repeatedly exposed to pairings of self-relevant information with smiling faces showed enhanced implicit self-esteem.&lt;ref name="increasing implicit self-esteem" /&gt;

In addition, studies have also found that pairing the word ‘I’ with positive traits heightens implicit self-esteem regardless of the level of temporal self-esteem prior to the conditioning process. Subliminal presentation of the stimuli reflected that implicit self-esteem is altered in the absence of consciousness. Given that evaluative conditioning changes attitude at a fundamental level and the evaluation that is automatically activated on encountering the attitude object, implicit self-esteem could be assessed as attitude towards the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dijksterhuis | first1 = AP. | year = 2004 | title = I like myself but I don't know why: enhancing implicit self-esteem by subliminal evaluative conditioning | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 86 | issue = | pages = 345–355 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.86.2.345 | pmid=14769089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social comparison===
The [[self-evaluation maintenance theory]] (SEM)  suggests that the success of one's partner or "[[significant other]]" in areas that are self-relevant can cause people to feel threatened, allowing comparison of one’s self to the self of another, impacting self-evaluation. Intimacy of relationships predicts likelihood of upward social comparison, which inevitably leads to lower implicit self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Nicholls, E. 2011"/&gt;

Given that the SEM is moderated by intimacy of relationship, its impact can be a prominent influential factor between romantic partners. Evidence shows that men tend to have lowered implicit self-esteem when their romantic partner succeeded than when they failed, automatically interpreting their romantic partner's success as their own failure. The underlying explanation might be that self-evaluation is driven by one's expectations around fulfillment of one's role as a man. Another explanation in line with the interpersonal nature of self-evaluation stems from the belief that women are attracted to men’s success. Hence, the perception of failure in a man could trigger his fear associated with acceptance from his significant other, as well as abandonment issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ratliff | first1 = K.A. | last2 = Oishi | first2 = S. | year = 2013 | title = Gender difference in implicit self-esteem following a romantic partner's success or failures | doi = 10.1037/a0033769| journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 105 | issue = | pages = 688–702 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, studies of social comparison on implicit self-esteem has yielded the conclusion that comparisons with other individuals can impact one's self-esteem. In addition, these effects are greater when there is a close psychological identification with the partner with whom one is being compared.

==Consequences and correlations==
An individual's level of implicit self-esteem affects him or her in various crucial domains that are relevant to social, emotional, and cognitive well-being. In some cases, discrepancies between the implicit and explicit self-esteem effects affective well-being and are highly associated with clinical symptoms. Implicit self-esteem also determines how individuals approach relational conflicts and social settings. While low levels of implicit self-esteem can be erroneous, boosts in implicit self-esteem through mechanisms involved in narcissism can also impair an individual's performance in cognitive tasks and external representation of competence in occupational settings.

===Discrepancies between implicit and explicit self-esteem===
When explicit self-esteem is lower, it is called ''damaged self-esteem.''  When the implicit self-esteem is lower it is called ''defensive self-esteem.''

It has been found that individuals who tend to have a higher correspondence between implicit and explicit self-esteem, trust their intuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jordan | first1 = Christian H. | last2 = Whitfield | first2 = Mervyn | last3 = Zeigler-Hill | first3 = Virgil | year = 2007 | title = Intuition and the correspondence between implicit and explicit self-esteem | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 93 | issue = 6| pages = 1067–1079 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.93.6.1067 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Damaged self-esteem====
Individuals with a combination of high implicit and low explicit self-esteem possess what psychologists call a ''damaged self-esteem''.

Study results indicate that, in comparison to individuals with low implicit and low explicit self-esteem, individuals with damaged self-esteem exhibit more optimism and less self-protection&lt;ref&gt;Steven J. Spencer, Christian H. Jordan, Christine E.R. Logel, Mark P. Zanna: ''Nagging doubts and a glimmer of hope. The role of implicit self-esteem in self-image maintenance''. 2005. As cited by: {{cite journal | last1 = Zeigler-Hill | first1 = Virgil | last2 = Terry | first2 = Carol | year = 2007 | title = Perfectionism and explicit self-esteem: The moderating role of implicit self-esteem | url = | journal = Self and Identity | volume = 6 | issue = 2–3| pages = 137–153 | doi = 10.1080/15298860601118850 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as higher levels of both maladaptive and adaptive perfectionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeigler-Hill | first1 = Virgil | last2 = Terry | first2 = Carol | year = 2007 | title = Perfectionism and explicit self-esteem: The moderating role of implicit self-esteem | url = | journal = Self and Identity | volume = 6 | issue = 2–3| pages = 137–153 | doi = 10.1080/15298860601118850 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damaged self-esteem has also been found to correlate with many clinical symptoms and disorders. In particular, the size of the discrepancy between implicit and explicit self-esteem in the direction of a damaged self-esteem has been found to correlate positively with heightened symptoms of depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation and loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Creemers | first1 = D.H.M. | last2 = Scholte | first2 = R.H.J. | last3 = Engels | first3 = R.C.M.E | last4 = Prinstein | first4 = M.J. | last5 = Wiers | first5 = R.W. | year = 2012 | title = Implicit and explicit self-esteem as concurrent predictors of suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, and loneliness | url = | journal = Journal of behavior therapy and experimental psychiatry | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 638–646 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbtep.2011.09.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While implicit self-esteem itself is not correlated with these internalizing symptoms, the interaction between implicit and explicit self-esteem does. In particular, when individuals display low explicit self-esteem, their level of implicit self-esteem becomes directly and positively correlated with their level of suicidal ideation. This reflects the crucial role of implicit self-esteem in internalizing problems. We can understand the impact of a damaged self-esteem as an entrapment between goals, which stem from implicit self-esteem, and reality, which mediates explicit self-esteem. Indeed, damaged self-esteem has been found to correlate with a maladaptive pattern of perfectionism, which is hinged upon rigidly high expectations that often contribute to failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Creemers | first1 = D.H.M. | last2 = Scholte | first2 = R.H.J. | last3 = Engels | first3 = R.C.M.E | last4 = Prinstein | first4 = M.J. | last5 = Wiers | first5 = R.W. | year = 2012 | title = Implicit and explicit self-esteem as concurrent predictors of suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, and loneliness | url = | journal = Journal of behavior therapy and experimental psychiatry | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 638–646 | doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2011.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of damaged self-esteem also showed a relationship to the use of self-defeating humor as a coping strategy, however, the causal direction is unclear. It could be that the frequent use of self-defeating humor lead to the development of damaged self-esteem (e.g., through a downward spiral of social rejection), or, that people with damaged self-esteem are more likely to use self-defeating humor (i.e., in line with their uncomplimentary view of the self). Another alternative is that both self-defeating humor and damaged self-esteem are caused by a third variable, such as neuroticism or [[alexithymia]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damaged self-esteem has also been found to correlate positively with internet addiction, the underlying mechanism of which parallels that of clinical conditions such as bulimia nervosa. This occurrence of compulsions may be attributed to an automatic defense mechanism in which the individual avoids anxiety. However, the development of a damaged self-esteem as an avoidance mechanism can also precipitate difficulties in establishing a consistent self-view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stieger | first1 = S. | last2 = Burger | first2 = C. | year = 2010 | title = Implicit and explicit self-esteem in the context of internet addiction | url = | journal = Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 681–687 | doi=10.1089/cyber.2009.0426 | pmid=21142993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Defensive self-esteem====
Conversely, individuals with a combination of low implicit and high explicit self-esteem have what is called ''defensive self-esteem'' (or synonymously ''fragile self-esteem''). In a comparative study it was found that individuals with defensive self-esteem tended to be less forgiving than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eaton | first1 = Judy | last2 = Struthers | first2 = C. Ward | last3 = Shomrony | first3 = Anat | last4 = Santelli | first4 = Alexander G. | year = 2007 | title = When apologies fail: The moderating effect of implicit and explicit self-esteem on apology and forgiveness | url = | journal = Self and Identity | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 2–3 | doi = 10.1080/15298860601118819 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implicit self-esteem correlates===

====Social performance====
An important indicator of relationship stability and health is conflict behavior, the way individuals behave during a conflict. Peterson and DeHart found that implicit self-esteem can regulate connection during times of relationship crises. Studies suggest that individuals with high implicit self-esteem tend to engage more in nonverbal positive behaviors during conflict when they perceive their partners to be committed. Positive nonverbal behaviors during conflict is extremely predictive of relationship outcomes such as commitment, satisfaction and stability. Also, implicit self-esteem also predicts sensitivity towards partners’ availability or support, even within a relationship-threat. That is, individuals high in implicit self-esteem tend to be implicitly motivated to consciously correct for connection and sensitivity to their partners’ effort, despite explicitly doubting their investment in the relationship. This ability to overcome relationship-threats as perpetuated by high levels of implicit self-esteem is crucial to relational well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peterson | first1 = J.L. | last2 = DeHart | first2 = T. | year = 2013 | title = Regulating connection: implicit self-esteem predicts positive non-verbal behavior during romantic relationship-threat | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 99–105 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2012.07.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, low implicit self-esteem has also been found to precipitate uncertainty in self-concept. This instability in grasping the self is especially erroneous in regulation of behaviors in social situations. It has been shown that uncertainty about the self makes people vulnerable to holding and expressing minority opinions, especially those who are susceptible to self-threat (low self-esteem). Individuals with low implicit self-esteem tend to respond defensively to self-threats, and because minority opinions are more self-diagnostic than majority ones, individuals may hold these opinions to shield themselves from threat of uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rios | first1 = K. | last2 = Wheeler | first2 = S.C. | last3 = Miller | first3 = D.T. | year = 2012 | title = Compensatory and nonconformity: Self-uncertainty and low implicit self-esteem increase adoption and expression of minority opinions | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 1300–1309 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2012.07.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also tend to take extreme views and to over-estimate the social consensus for their views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McGregor | first1 = Ian | last2 = Jordan | first2 = Christian H. | year = 2007 | title = The mask of zeal: Low implicit self-esteem, threat, and defensive extremism | url = | journal = Self and Identity | volume = 6 | issue = 2–3| pages = 223–237 | doi = 10.1080/15298860601115351 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender role====
Gender differences play a vital role in implicit self-esteem in how it is influenced by the performance of the significant other.

Also, women are more prone to trust their feelings and intuition, in contrast to men.  The correlation between explicit and implicit self-esteem is greater for women then for men. Implicit self-esteem contains instinctive and empirical factors; then people who are in touch with their feelings, would report to have higher explicit self-esteem scores, which are consistent to implicit self-esteem scores. There were six studies that supported this idea, and these results were held in three diverse cultures, two unlike measures of implicit self-esteem.{{clarify|date=July 2014}} These ideas showed the correlation between implicit and explicit self-esteem. This is higher for women than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pelham | first1 = Brett W. | last2 = Koole | first2 = Sander L. | last3 = Hardin | first3 = Curtis D. | last4 = Hetts | first4 = John J. | last5 = Seah | first5 = Eileen | last6 = DeHart | first6 = Tracy | year = 2005 | title = Gender moderates the relation between implicit and explicit self-esteem | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = 1| pages = 84–89 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2003.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cognitive performance====
Self-affirming activities that significantly raises implicit self-esteem, such as viewing one’s own Facebook profile page, has been shown to decrease motivation to do well in cognitive tasks of moderate difficulty. Results like this suggest that a peak in unconscious positivity associated with the self may discount an individual’s efforts to further prove his worth in other areas. Consequently, this leaves an individual unmotivated to perform well in more practical settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Toma | first1 = C. L. | year = 2013 | title = Feeling better but doing worse: effects of Facebook self-presentation on implicit self-esteem and cognitive task performance | url = | journal = Media psychology | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 199–220 | doi=10.1080/15213269.2012.762189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement and assessment==
Implicit self-esteem is assessed using indirect measures of cognitive processing. These include the [[Name letter effect|Name Letter Task]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Sander L. |last1=Koole |first2=Brett W. |last2=Pelham |chapter=On the Nature of Implicit Self-Esteem: The Case of the Name Letter Effect |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJIKwXPZKg0C&amp;pg=PA93 |editors=Steven Spencer, [[Steven Fein]], Mark P. Zanna and James M. Olson |title=Motivated social perception |publisher=[[Lawrence Erlbaum]] |location=[[Mahwah, New Jersey]] |year=2003 |pages=93–116 |isbn=0-8058-4036-2 |accessdate=25 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Implicit Association Test]].&lt;ref name="association test"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Anthony G. |last1=Greenwald |first2=Shelly D. |last2=Farnham |title=Using the implicit association test to measure self-esteem and self-concept |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=79 |issue=6 |pages=1022–38 |date=December 2000 |pmid=11138752 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.6.1022 |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/agg/pdf/Gwald_Farnham_JPSP_2000.OCR.pdf |accessdate=25 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such indirect measures are designed to reduce awareness of, or control of, the process of assessment. When used to assess implicit self-esteem, they feature stimuli designed to represent the [[self (psychology)|self]], such as personal pronouns (e.g., "I") or letters in one's name.

===Name-letter effect===
{{Main article|Name-letter effect}} 
The so-called Name Letter Task (NLT, also called Initial Preference Task, IPT) relies on the name-letter effect and is one of the widest used measures of implicit self-esteem. Different measures have been proposed in order to improve the psychometrical properties of the name letter task.&lt;ref&gt;

The name-letter effect represents the idea that an individual prefers the letters belonging to their own name and will select these above other letters in choice tasks or rate them as more favourable or attractive than other letters in rating tasks. It seemingly occurs subconsciously,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koole | first1 = S. L. | last2 = Dijksterhuis | first2 = A. | last3 = van Knippenberg | first3 = A. | year = 2001 | title = What's in a name: Implicit self-esteem and the automatic self | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 669–685 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.4.669}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[mere-exposure effect]] ruled out as a possible explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = J. T. | last2 = Pelham | first2 = B. W. | last3 = Mirenberg | first3 = M. C. | last4 = Hetts | first4 = J. J. | year = 2002 | title = Name–letter preferences are not merely mere exposure: Implicit egotism as self-regulation | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 170–177 | doi=10.1006/jesp.2001.1497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This effect has been found in a vast range of studies. In one such scenario, participants were given a list of letters, one of which contained letters from their own name and the other of which contained other letters, and asked them to circle the preferred letter. This study found that, even when accounting for all other variables, letters belonging to the participants' own names were preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nuttin | first1 = J. M. | year = 1985 | title = Narcissism beyond Gestalt and awareness: The name letter effect | url = | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 353–361 | doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420150309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar results have been found in cross-cultural studies, using different alphabets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoorens | first1 = V. | last2 = Nuttin | first2 = J. M. | last3 = Herman | first3 = I. E. | last4 = Pavakanun | first4 = U. | year = 1990 | title = Mastery pleasure versus mere ownership: A quasi-experimental cross-cultural and cross alphabetical test of the name letter effect | url = | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 181–205 | doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420200302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note the difference between the name-letter effect and 'implicit egotism',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pelham | first1 = B.W. | last2 = Carvallo | first2 = M. | last3 = Jones | first3 = J.T. | year = 2005 | title = Implicit egoism | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 106–110 | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00344.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter being attributed to the way people gravitate towards places, people and situations that reflect themselves, including perhaps similarities with their own name. Indeed, research into the topic has shown similarities between people's names and their future careers; for example, the names Dennis and Denise are overepresented among [[dentists]].&lt;ref&gt;Pelham, B.W., Mirenberg, M.C., &amp; Jones, J.T. (2002) Why Susie Sells Seashells by the Seashore: Implicit Egotism and Major Life Decisions, Attitudes and Social Cognition&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implicit-association test===
{{Main article|Implicit-association test}} 
The implicit-association test is an experimental method used by psychologists to attempt to tap into a person's automatic, or [[subconscious]] association between a concept and an attribute.&lt;ref name="social cognition" /&gt; It has been widely used in an attempt to uncover a person's subconscious prejudices against certain members of society, such as those who are overweight, as well as other implicit stereotypes and associations. The test was formatted in order to measure [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref name="association test" /&gt; Participants are asked to make rapid responses, co-classifying themselves ("the self") and positive attributes, as well as negative attributes. The speed, or ease of these associations made is said to show a subconscious, or implicit preference for one attribute over another, with regards to the self.

====Findings====
Many studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karpinski | first1 = A | year = 2004 | title = Measuring self-esteem using the implicit association test: The role of the other | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 22–34 | doi=10.1177/0146167203258835}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that the vast majority of people's implicit self-esteem is positively biased. That is, people find it a great deal easier to associate themselves with a positive concept than a negative one. Whether this is truly displaying implicit self-esteem is arguable; the findings may instead be linked with [[illusory superiority]], in that people tend to rate themselves as above average on a number of scales.

'''Implicit self-esteem''' &lt;br&gt;
In the article "Stalking the perfect measure of implicit self-esteem: The blind men and the elephant revisited?",&lt;ref name="Bosson, J. K. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bosson | first1 = J. K. | last2 = Swann | first2 = W. R. | last3 = Pennebaker | first3 = J. W. | year = 2000 | title = Stalking the perfect measure of implicit self-esteem: The blind men and the elephant revisited? | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 79 | issue = 4| pages = 631–643 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.79.4.631 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the validity and reliability of seven implicit self-esteem measures have been explored. The implicit measures were not correlated with one another. However they did correlate, but only faintly with measures of explicit self-esteem.  The implicit self-esteem measurements confirmed partial reliabilities in correlation to good test-retest reliabilities.  Nonetheless implicit measures were limited in their ability to calculate standard variables, for the test. Certain evidence explained that measurements of implicit self-esteem are delicate to put in context, which is further argued in later research of implicit self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Bosson, J. K. 2000"/&gt;

====Links with explicit self-esteem====
However, the validity of the implicit-association test and implicit self-esteem as a measure of [[self-esteem]] itself is questionable due to mixed evidence with regards to explicit self-esteem. On the one hand, researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bosson | first1 = J.K. | last2 = Swann | first2 = W.B. | last3 = Pennebaker | first3 = J.W. | year = 2000 | title = Stalking the perfect measure of implicit self esteem: The blind men and the elephant revisited? | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 79 | issue = | pages = 631–649 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.4.631}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a detailed and comprehensive study of implicit self-esteem found the IAT to correlate weakly, yet consistently, with measures of explicit self-esteem. However, more recent research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rudolph | first1 = A. | last2 = Schroder-Abe | first2 = M. | last3 = Schultz | first3 = A. | last4 = Gregg | first4 = A. P. | last5 = Sedikides | first5 = C. | year = 2008 | title = Through a glass, less darkly? Reassessing convergent and discriminant validity in measures of implicit self-esteem | url = | journal = European Journal of Psychological Assessment | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 273–281 | doi=10.1027/1015-5759.24.4.273}}&lt;/ref&gt; has found measures of explicit self-esteem, such as questionnaires, to be independent of implicit self-esteem, providing an interesting insight into the validity of implicit self-esteem, explicit self-esteem, and the nature of [[self-esteem]] itself.

In [[computer science]], '''incremental learning''' is a method of [[machine learning]], in which input data is continuously used to extend the existing model's knowledge i.e. to further train the model. It represents a dynamic technique of [[supervised learning]] and [[unsupervised learning]] that can be applied when training data becomes available gradually over time or its size is out of system memory limits. Algorithms that can facilitate incremental learning are known as incremental machine learning algorithms.

Many traditional machine learning algorithms inherently support incremental learning, other algorithms can be adapted to facilitate this. Examples of incremental algorithms include

The aim of incremental learning is for the learning model to adapt to new data without forgetting its existing knowledge, it does not retrain the model.  Some incremental learners have built-in some parameter or assumption that controls the relevancy of old data, while others, called stable incremental machine learning algorithms, learn representations of the training data that are not even partially forgotten over time. Fuzzy ART&lt;ref name="Fuzzy ART"&gt;Carpenter, G.A., Grossberg, S., &amp; Rosen, D.B., [http://dcommon.bu.edu/bitstream/handle/2144/2070/91.015.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y Fuzzy ART: Fast stable learning and categorization of analog patterns by an adaptive resonance system], Neural Networks, 4(6): 759-771, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; and TopoART&lt;ref name="TopoART" /&gt; are two examples for this second approach.

Incremental algorithms are frequently applied to [[data stream]]s or [[big data]], addressing issues in data availability and resource scarcity respectively. Stock trend prediction and user profiling are some examples of data streams where new data becomes continuously available.  Applying incremental learning to big data aims to produce faster [[statistical classification|classification]] or [[forecasting]] times.

'''''Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences''''' is a 1988 book by [[mathematician]] [[John Allen Paulos]] about "[[numeracy|innumeracy]]," a term he embraced to describe the mathematical equivalent of [[illiteracy]]: incompetence with numbers rather than words. Innumeracy is a problem with many otherwise educated and knowledgeable people. While many people would be ashamed to admit they are illiterate, there is very little shame in saying "I'm a people person, not a numbers person." Or "I always hated math".&lt;ref name="Innumeracy-book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paulos|first1=John Allen|title=Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences|publisher=Hill and Wang|isbn=0-8090-7447-8|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Elizabeth|title=Why do Americans Stink in Math?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/magazine/why-do-americans-stink-at-math.html?_r=0|website=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|date=2014-07-14|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cundiff|first1=Elizabeth|title=Innumeracy|url=http://scholarsmine.mst.edu/peer2peer/vol1/iss1/5/|website=Missouri University of Science and Technology Scholars' Mine|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sketch guy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Carl|title=Americans are Bad at Math|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/your-money/americans-are-bad-at-math-but-its-not-too-late-to-fix.html?ref=topics&amp;_r=0|date=2014-08-04|website=New York Times|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulos speaks mainly of the common misconceptions in regard to numbers. He looks at real-world examples in stock scams, psychics, astrology, sports records, elections, sex discrimination, UFOs, insurance and law, lotteries and drug testing.&lt;ref name="Innumeracy-book" /&gt; Paulos discusses innumeracy with quirky anecdotes, scenarios and facts, encouraging readers in the end to look at their world in a more [[quantitative property|quantitative]] way. The book sheds light on the link between innumeracy and pseudoscience. For example, the fortune telling psychic's few correct and general observations are remembered over the many incorrect guesses. He also stresses the problem between the actual number of occurrences of various risks and popular perceptions of those risks happening.&lt;ref name="Innumeracy-book" /&gt; The problems of innumeracy come at a great cost to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gina Donaldson, Jenny Field, Dave Harries, Clare, Tope, Helen Taylor|title=Becoming a Primary Mathematics Specialist Teacher|page=22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MHkJMtgVNp0C&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=costs+of+innumeracy+to+society&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X0BkMeVj9g&amp;sig=I1sCzWCDZnUkhf0xoyhxInZvMxs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijgeaa4u7OAhVDxCYKHR2wAkwQ6AEIWTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=costs%20of%20innumeracy%20to%20society&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topics include [[probability]] and [[coincidence]], innumeracy in [[pseudoscience]], [[statistics]] and trade-offs in society. For example, the danger of getting killed in a car accident is much greater than terrorism and this danger should be reflected in how we allocate our limited resources.

==Background==

[[John Allen Paulos]] (born July 4, 1945) is an American professor of mathematics at Temple University in Pennsylvania.  He is a writer and speaker on mathematics and the importance of mathematical literacy. Paulos writes about many subjects, especially of the dangers of mathematical innumeracy; that is, the layperson's misconceptions about numbers, probability and logic. He has received awards in:
2013 JPBM ([[Joint Policy Board for Mathematics]]) Award for Communicating Mathematics on a Sustained Basis to Large Audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JPBM Award for Communicating Mathematics|url=http://math.mit.edu/mathcomm/archives/john-allen-paulos-to-receive-math-communications-award/|publisher=JPBM}}&lt;/ref&gt;
2003 AAAS ([[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]) Award for Promoting the Public Understanding of Science and Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AAAS|url=http://www.aaas.org/aboutaaas/awards/public/public2003.shtml|publisher=AAAS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a reasons for writing the book he states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Innumeracy, an inability to deal comfortably with the fundamental notions of number and chance, plagues far too many otherwise knowledgeable citizens. The same people who cringe when words such as “imply” and “infer” are confused react without a trace of embarrassment to even the most egregious of numerical solecisms. I remember once listening to someone at a party drone on about the difference between “continually” and “continuously.” Later that evening we were watching the news, and the TV weathercaster announced that there was a 50 percent chance of rain for Saturday and a 50 percent chance for Sunday, and concluded that there was therefore a 100 percent chance of rain that weekend. The remark went right by the self-styled grammarian, and even after I explained the mistake to him, he wasn’t nearly as indignant as he would have been had the weathercaster left a dangling participle.&lt;ref name="Innumeracy-book" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Chapters==
# Examples and Principles. This chapter goes over how peoples lack of clarity of very large numbers lead to misconceptions. He argues for [[scientific notation]] being a clearer way to work with larger numbers. The ability to put numbers large and small in the correct context is key to understanding them in an intelligent way. He gives examples in some jokes, [[Rubik's cube]], nuclear weapons, travel at the speed of light, the number of 3 scoop combinations at Baskin-Robbins, dice rolls, the chance of getting AIDS and the chance of breathing the same molecule of breath as Julius Caesar.
# Probability and Coincidence. Underestimates of the frequency of coincidences is an example of innumeracy. People underestimate that an unlikely event is likely, given a large population sample. He gives examples in stock market newsletter scams, choosing a spouse, [[coincidence]] and the law, [[coin toss]] and the [[Hot-hand fallacy]] in sports.
# Pseudoscience. Here the author takes on how non-falsifiable statements play in with pseudoscience. For example ''Whatever God wills happens''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paulos|first1=John Allen|title=Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences|publisher=Hill and Wang|isbn=0-8090-7447-8|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; can not be proven false so is not part of science. He touches examples in [[Freud]], [[Marx]], [[parapsychology]], dream prediction, [[astrology]], [[UFO's]], fraudulent medical treatments, [[Conditional probability]], [[blackjack]], drug testing and [[numerology]].
# What is Innumeracy? Here the author critiques public math education, the need for estimation in the math curriculum, math and humor(Paulos suggests that mathematicians have a particular sense of humor),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paulos|first1=John Allen|title=Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences|publisher=Hill and Wang|isbn=0-8090-7447-8|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; innumeracy and the tendency to personalize excessively versus a statistical analysis, selective filtering of data to draw incorrect conclusions, decisions and framing of questions, various misconceptions about math being cold, impersonal or constraining and public safety risks.
# Statistics, Trade-Offs, and Society. This chapter addresses trade-offs in public policy, the [[prisoners dilemma]], [[type I and type II errors]] in statistics, when a true [[hypothesis]] is thought to be untrue or when a false hypothesis is thought to be true.

''Innumeracy'' made the New York Times best seller the year it came out in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JPBM Communications Award|url=http://www.ams.org/images/JPBM-CA-citation-samples.pdf|accessdate=3 September 2016|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was on the New York Times best seller for 18 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JPBM Communications Award|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201305/rnoti-p610.pdf|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a slightly revised addition in 2001.&lt;ref name="Complete-review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/maths/paulosja.htm|title=Innumeracy|website=Complete Review|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received favorable reviews in the New York Times "He takes us a couple of steps closer to numeracy, and it is all in all an enlightening place to be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lehmann-Haupt|first1=Christopher|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/23/books/books-of-the-times-dangers-of-being-a-nation-of-number-numbskulls.html|website=New York Times|date=1989-01-23|title=Innumeracy|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chicago Tribune wrote "Despite the title, which suggests yet another learned report documenting the sorry state of America's educational system, what Paulos provides is a readable romp across a varied mathematical landscape.

'''International Women's Year''' ('''IWY''') was the name given to 1975 by the [[United Nations]]. Since that year March 8 has been celebrated as [[International Women's Day]], and the '''United Nations Decade for Women''', from 1976 to 1985, was also established.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/events/womensday/2010/history.shtml International Women's Day]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="choike1453"/&gt;

==History==
After years of work by the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]] (CSW) to adopt a declaration to eliminate discrimination against women, in 1965, CSW began working in earnest to obtain passage of a declaration to secure women's human rights. Collating responses covering education, employment, inheritance, penal reform, and other issues, from government actors, NGO representatives and UN staff, CSW delegates drafted the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women]] (DEDAW), which was passed by the General Assembly on 7 November 1967.{{sfn|Fraser|1999|pp=891-892}} Once support had been garnered for the declaration, the next step was to prepare it to become a [[Treaty|Convention]]. Though there were delays, by 1972, when the [[United States Congress]] passed [[Title IX]], eliminating discrimination in education for any institution receiving federal funding, hope that passage could be secured surged.{{sfn|Fraser|1999|pp=893-894}} In the meantime, members of the [[Women's International Democratic Federation]] (WIDF) had long been pressing for an international women's year and conference to address women's inequality. As WIDF was designated as an observer and not a member of the CSW, they could not propose the event directly, but drafted a proposal. Persuading the [[Romania]]n delegate of CSW to present their proposal, it was seconded by Finland. In turn, CSW approved the proposal and submitted it to the General Assembly, which proclaimed 1975 as International Women's Year in December 1972.{{sfn|Armstrong|2013|p=201}} The date was significant because it would take place on the thirtieth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=123}} But there were problems with the conference. Initially Soviet women rejected the call for a conference and [[filibuster]]ed the negotiations, preferring to host their own conference in [[East Berlin]] that would not be subject to the UN structure.{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=5}}{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=441}} As part of the [[Cold War]] politics, the United States then proposed that the conference not be limited to women, but should be gender neutral, because an all-woman conference would not be taken seriously.{{sfn|Teltsch|1974|p=43}} Finally, [[Mexico City]] agreed to host the conference, and CSW set about the tasks to prepare the "machinery" necessary to secure passage of CEDAW.{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=441}} [[Helvi Sipilä]], was selected as the Assistant Secretary General for Social Development and Humanitarian affairs and placed in charge of organizing events for the year.{{sfn|Fraser|1999|pp=893-894}}

==International==
===Mexico City===
The first [[World Conference on Women, 1975|UN World Conference on Women]] was held in [[Mexico City]] from 19 June to 2 July.&lt;ref name="choike1453"/&gt; The 1975 conference led to the adoption of the [[World Plan of Action]], as well as the [[Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace]].{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=6}} It led to the establishment of monitoring mechanisms such as, [[International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women]] (INSTRAW) and the [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM) and set in motion plans for follow-up conferences, the first of which would be held in 1980 in [[Copenhagen]]. It established the period of 1975 to 1985 as the [[United Nations Decade for Women|UN Decade for Women]], to enable progress and failures to be evaluated and resulted in urging that the [[CEDAW|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)]] be quickly ratified.{{sfn|Pietilä|2007|p=43}}{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=155}} The 1985 third conference in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], not only closed the decade of women, but set a series of member state schedules for removal of legislated gender discrimination in national laws by the year 2000.&lt;ref name=dowie&gt;Allison Dowie, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=L5FAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9aQMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2937,4035456 Dangers on the Road to Complete Emancipation], ''Glasgow Herald'', 22 October 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arvonne S.

Prominent attendees included [[Elizabeth Anne Reid|Elizabeth Reid]] and [[Margaret Whitlam]] of Australia.&lt;ref name="naa-fs237"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naa.gov.au/fSheets/fs237.html |title=International Women's Year, 1975 |work=[[National Archives of Australia]] |accessdate=15 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610130940/http://www.naa.gov.au/fsheets/fs237.html |archivedate=June 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''International Women's Year Tribune'' was also organised and attended by 4,000 women in 1975.&lt;ref name="choike1453"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.choike.org/nuevo_eng/informes/1453.html | title = 1st World Conference on Women, Mexico 1975 | work = Choike, [[Third World Institute]] |  accessdate =15 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Berlin===
The World Congress of Women was held in East Berlin as a part of IWY soon after the Mexico City event. It idealized women’s equality as the "true embodiment of the socialist conception of human rights".{{sfn|Eckel|Moyn|2013|pp=68-69}} The Working Group on Equal Rights, composed of experts on government and law from the [[East German Academy of Sciences]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]] and [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist United Party Central Committee]] rejected the notion that women's rights should fall under a separate area designated by gender, but instead should be governed by the United Nations Human Right's position.{{sfn|Eckel|Moyn|2013|p=79}} [[Angela Davis]] was one of the key guests at the conference, as was [[Hortensia Bussi de Allende]], former [[First Lady of Chile]].{{sfn|Eckel|Moyn|2013|p=81}} The state-sponsored program advocated women's solidarity in the national struggles to free women from oppression based on class, race and gender through state socialism.{{sfn|Eckel|Moyn|2013|pp=83-85}}

===Brussels===
The [[International Tribunal on the Crimes Against Women]] was planned as an event for IWY but was not held until 4 to 8 March 1976 in [[Brussels]], Belgium. Limited by funding strictures, the conference hosted 2000 women from forty countries. Speakers addressed economic exploitation and violence against women in its many forms. The most significant development to come out of the conference was the [[International Feminist Network]].{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=214}}

==Zionism controversy==
The 1975 conference was also notable for passing the first "Zionism is racism" resolution passed at any UN-sponsored forum, thus preparing the way for [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379]] in 1975 the following November.&lt;ref&gt;Text of resolution 3379:

:''TAKING NOTE of the Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace 1975, proclaimed by the World Conference of the International Women's Year, held at Mexico City from 19 June to 2 July 1975, which promulgated the principle that "international co-operation and peace require the achievement of national liberation and independence, the elimination of colonialism and neo-colonialism, foreign occupation, Zionism, apartheid and racial discrimina as the recognition of the dignity of peoples and their right to self-determination".''; {{cite web |url=http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/761C1063530766A7052566A2005B74D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206052903/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/761C1063530766A7052566A2005B74D1 |archivedate=2012-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jwa.org/exhibits/jsp/general.jsp?&amp;imgfile=exhibits%2Fimages%2Fexhban7.gif&amp;media_id=abamexic&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement equating Zionism with racism was also included in an annex to a report to be considered at the final conference of the United Nations Decade for Women in 1985 in Nairobi, Kenya.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;Sam Roberts, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/us/bernice-tannenbaum-who-fought-un-resolution-on-zionism-dies-at-101.html?_r=0 "Bernice Tannenbaum, Who Fought U.N. Resolution on Zionism, Dies at 101"], 9 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as stated in ''It Takes a Dream: The Story of Hadassah'' (1997), by Marlin Levin, "[[Bernice Tannenbaum|Bernice]] asked [President Ronald] Reagan to publicly repudiate the U.N. resolution. He agreed and promised that the U.S. delegation would walk out of Nairobi if the Zionism-equals-racism resolution was included in the final conference declaration."&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; Tannenbaum also convinced the United States Senate to condemn the conference resolution and demand its withdrawal.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; She also personally flew to Kenya with a draft of the Senate resolution, where [[Maureen Reagan]], President Reagan's daughter and the head of the American delegation, repeated the president’s promise to withdraw from the conference if the resolution was included in the final conference delegation.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; Kenya then brokered a compromise in which Zionism was omitted from the final conference report.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

==National==
===Australia===
A conference on 'Women and Politics' was held in September,&lt;ref name="naa-fs237"/&gt; attended by 700 women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/occa_lect/transcripts/290906/index.htm | author = [[Marian Sawer]] | title = Red, White and Blue, What Do They Mean to You? The Significance of Political Colours |date= 29 September 2006 | accessdate =15 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The events of IWY in Canada as a whole raised awareness with Canadian women as well as the general public on a wide range of women’s issues and accomplishments. It spurred creation of the Ontario Women and the Law Association and the Service, Office and Retail Workers Union of Canada (SORWUC) and offered funding for many to participate in educational and artistic endeavors aimed at presenting women’s perspectives. One such effort was a petition to the [[National Film Board of Canada]] which led to the creation of Studio D. The [[University of Guelph]] hosted a conference in September dedicated to [[Nellie McClung]] and the reform issues which had been important to her.{{sfn|Pierson|Cohen|1993|p=362}}

===New Zealand===
In June a United Women's Convention was held in [[Wellington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.democrit.net/IWY/Forum1975.htm |title=Forum 1975 |accessdate=15 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928170942/http://www.democrit.net/IWY/Forum1975.htm |archivedate=28 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States of America===
Events in support of IWY were held throughout the United States by private organizations and NGOs, such as those held in [[Connecticut]], 11–12 June 1977 and the ''[[Greater Cleveland]] Congress'', October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.lib.uconn.edu/online/research/speclib/ASC/findaids/IWY/MSS19860003.html | title = International Women's Year Conference Records | work = Thomas J. Dodd Research Center, [[University of Connecticut]] | accessdate =15 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=IWYGCC | title = INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S YEAR, GREATER CLEVELAND CONGRESS | work = [[Case Western Reserve University]] | accessdate =15 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most significant US events, because it was funded by the US government, was held in [[Houston, Texas]] and though planned as an IWY event, did not take place until 1977. The [[1977 National Women's Conference]] included women from each state in the United States and developed a National Plan of Action, mirroring many of the points of the World Plan of Action.{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=215}}

== Outcomes ==
{{Main|United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3520|Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace}}
As a result of the international focus on Women in 1975, a number of institutions were established:
* [[International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women]] (INSTRAW)
* [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM)
* [[Women's Studies Resource Centre]] was established in [[South Australia]] during July.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=677 | title = Women's Movement page 6 | work = ''[[South Australia|SM]] Memory'', [[State Library of South Australia]] | accessdate =15 July  2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emblem==
The IWY also launched the "dove" emblem used by the IWY, CEDAW, and UNIFIL.  A stylized dove intersected by a female symbol and an equal sign, the emblem was donated by then 27-year-old New York City advertising company graphic designer Valerie Pettis. It remains the official symbol of [[UN Women]]&lt;ref&gt;[tools.unifem.org/unifem_logos/UNIFEM-GraphicStandards.pdf Graphic Standards]. UNIFEM Headquarters, United Nations Secretariat document, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and is used in [[International Women's Day]] celebrations to this day.&lt;ref name=dowie /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=L5FAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9aQMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2937,4035456&amp;dq=valerie+pettis&amp;hl=en Dangers on the road to complete emancipation].

The '''invincible ignorance fallacy'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081002080428/http://www.cuyamaca.edu/brucethompson/Fallacies/invincible_ignorance.asp "Invincible Ignorance" by Bruce Thompson, Department of Humanities (Philosophy), Cuyamaca College]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[deductive fallacy]] of [[circular reasoning|circularity]] where the person in question simply refuses to believe the argument, ignoring any evidence given. It is not so much a fallacious tactic in argument as it is a refusal to argue in the proper sense of the word, the method instead being to either make assertions with no consideration of objections or to simply dismiss objections by calling them excuses, conjecture, etc. or saying that they are proof of nothing; all without actually demonstrating how the objection fit these terms (see [[Argumentum ad lapidem|ad lapidem fallacy]]).

==History==
The term "invincible ignorance" has its roots in [[Catholic theology]], where — as the opposite of the term [[vincible ignorance]] — it is used to refer to the state of persons (such as pagans and infants) who are ignorant of the [[Christianity|Christian]] message because they have not yet had an opportunity to hear it. The first Pope to use the term officially seems to have been [[Pope Pius IX]] in the [[allocution]] ''Singulari Quadam'' (9 December 1854) and the [[encyclical]]s ''Singulari Quidem'' (17 March 1856) and ''Quanto Conficiamur Moerore'' (10 August 1863). The term, however, is far older than that. [[Aquinas]], for instance, uses it in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' (written 1265–1274),&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas, [http://www.op.org/summa/a4/summa-I-IIq76a2.pdf ''Summa Theologica'' Ia IIae q.76 a.2]&lt;/ref&gt; and discussion of the concept can be found as far back as [[Origen]] (3rd century). When and how the term was taken by logicians to refer to the very different state of persons who deliberately refuse to attend to evidence remains unclear, but one of its first uses was in the book ''Fallacy: The Counterfeit of Argument '' by W. Ward Fearnside and William B. Holther&lt;ref&gt;Fearnside, W. Ward and William B. Holther, ''Fallacy: The Counterfeit of Argument'', 1959. {{ISBN|978-0-13-301770-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1959.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6589">'''KISS''' is an [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] for "'''Keep it simple, stupid'''" as a design principle noted by the [[U.S. Navy]] in 1960.&lt;ref name=TDal/&gt;&lt;ref name=EPar/&gt; The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore [[simplicity]] should be a key goal in [[design]], and that unnecessary complexity should be avoided. The phrase has been associated with aircraft engineer [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Kelly Johnson]].&lt;ref name=BRich/&gt; The term "KISS principle" was in popular use by 1970.&lt;ref name=Pit/&gt; Variations on the phrase include: "Keep it simple, silly", "keep it short and simple", "keep it simple and straightforward",&lt;ref name="monash"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.monash.edu/business/marketing/marketing-dictionary/k/kiss-principle |title=Kiss principle definition by MONASH Marketing Dictionary| date=1994-11-18 | accessdate=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; "keep it small and simple" and "keep it stupid simple".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://people.apache.org/~fhanik/kiss.html| title=Kiss Principle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The acronym was reportedly coined by [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Kelly Johnson]], lead engineer at the [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]] [[Skunk Works]] (creators of the [[Lockheed U-2]] and [[SR-71 Blackbird]] spy planes, among many others).&lt;ref name=BRich/&gt;

While popular usage has transcribed it for decades as "Keep it simple, stupid", Johnson transcribed it as "Keep it simple stupid" (no comma), and this reading is still used by many authors.&lt;ref name=misra&gt;Ram B. Misra (2004), "Global IT Outsourcing: Metrics for Success of All Parties", ''Journal of Information Technology Cases and Applications'', volume 6 issue 3, page 21. [http://web.njit.edu/~jerry/Outsourcing/out-JITCA-6-3-2004-2.pdf Online version]. Retrieved 2009-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no implicit meaning that an engineer was stupid; just the opposite.&lt;ref name=BRich/&gt;

The principle is best exemplified by the story of Johnson handing a team of design engineers a handful of tools, with the challenge that the jet aircraft they were designing must be repairable by an average mechanic in the field under combat conditions with only these tools. Hence, the "stupid" refers to the relationship between the way things break and the sophistication available to repair them.

The acronym has been used by many in the [[List of military slang terms|U.S. military]], especially the [[List of U.S. Navy acronyms and expressions|U.S. Navy]] and [[United States Air Force]], and in the field of [[software developer|software development]].

==Variants==
The principle most likely finds its origins in similar [[Minimalism|minimalist]] concepts, such as [[Occam's razor]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication", [[Mies Van Der Rohe]]'s "[[Less is more (architecture)|Less is more]]", [[Bjarne Stroustrup]]'s "Make Simple Tasks Simple!", or [[Antoine de Saint Exupéry]]'s "It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away". [[Colin Chapman]], the founder of [[Lotus Cars]], urged his designers to "Simplify, then add lightness". [[Heath Robinson]] machines and [[Rube Goldberg machine|Rube Goldberg's machines]], intentionally overly-complex solutions to simple tasks or problems, are humorous examples of "non-KISS" solutions. Also Shakespeare's "Brevity is the soul of wit".

A variant — "Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler" — is attributed to [[Albert Einstein]], although this may be an editor's paraphrase of a lecture he gave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/#more-2363|title=Everything Should Be Made as Simple as Possible, But Not Simpler|publisher=Quote Investigator}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In film animation==
Master animator [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]] explains the KISS principle in his book ''[[The Animator's Survival Kit]]'', and [[Disney's Nine Old Men]] write about it in ''[[Disney Animation: The Illusion of Life]]'', a considerable work of the genre. The problem faced is that inexperienced animators may "over-animate" in their works, that is, a character may move too much and do too much.  Williams urges animators to "KISS".

{{Linguistics}}
'''Linguistic rights''' are the [[human rights|human]] and [[civil rights]] concerning the individual and collective [[right]] to choose the language or languages for communication in a private or public atmosphere. Other parameters for analyzing linguistic rights include the degree of territoriality, amount of positivity, orientation in terms of assimilation or maintenance, and overtness.&lt;ref&gt;Extra, G., and Yağmur, K. (2004). "Language rights perspectives".&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic rights include, among others, the right to one's own language in legal, administrative and judicial acts, language education, and media in a language understood and freely chosen by those concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M., &amp; Hornberger, N.H. (2016). Re-visiting orientations to language planning: problem, right, and resource. ''Bilingual Review/La revista bilingüe, 33''(3), 30–49. Available from http://bilingualreview.utsa.edu/index.php/br/article/view/118&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic rights in international law are usually dealt in the broader framework of [[cultural rights|cultural]] and [[right to education|educational rights]].

Important documents for linguistic rights include the [[Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights]] (1996), the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] (1992), the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (1989) and the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] (1988), as well as [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention against Discrimination in Education]], Article 5&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (1966).&lt;ref&gt;[[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], Article 27&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Linguistic rights became more and more prominent throughout the course of history as language came to be increasingly seen as a part of nationhood. Although policies and legislation involving language have been in effect in early European history, these were often cases where a language was being imposed upon people while other languages or dialects were neglected. Most of the initial literature on linguistic rights came from countries where linguistic and/or national divisions grounded in linguistic diversity have resulted in linguistic rights playing a vital role in maintaining stability.&lt;ref&gt;Kymlicka, Will and Patten, Alan. (2003). "Introduction: Language Rights and Political Theory: Context, Issues and Approaches." In Will Kymlicka and Alan Patten (eds.), Language Rights and Political Theory(pp1-51): Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until the 1900s that linguistic rights gained official status in politics and international accords.&lt;ref&gt;Bruthiaux, Paul. (2008). "Language rights in historical and contemporary perspective." Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development, 30(1), 73–85&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic rights were first included as an international human right in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948.

Formal treaty-based language rights are mostly concerned with [[minority rights]]. The history of such language rights can be split into five phases.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas, Phillipson, and Rannut, 1994"&gt;Skutnabb-Kangas, Tove, Phillipson, Robert, and Rannut, Mart. (1994). "Linguistic human rights: overcoming linguistic discrimination." Walter de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Pre-1815. Language rights are covered in bilateral agreements, but not in international treaties, e.g. [[Treaty of Lausanne]] (1923).
# Final Act of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815). The conclusion to [[Napoleon I]]'s empire-building was signed by 7 European major powers. It granted the right to use Polish to Poles in Poznan alongside German for official business. Also, some national constitutions protects the language rights of national minorities, e.g. Austrian Constitutional Law of 1867 grants ethnic minorities the right to develop their nationality and language.
# Between World I and World War II. Under the aegis of the [[League of Nations]], Peace Treaties and major multilateral and international conventions carried clauses protecting minorities in Central and Eastern Europe, e.g., the right to private use of any language, and provision for instruction in primary schools through medium of own language.&lt;ref name="Caporti,1979"&gt;Caporti, Francesco. (1979). "Study of the Rights of Persons Belonging to Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities." New York: United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt; Many national constitutions followed this trend. But not all signatories provided rights to minority groups within their own borders such as United Kingdom, France, and US. Treaties also provided right of complaint to League of Nations and [[International Court of Justice]].
# 1945–1970s. International legislation for protection of human rights was undertaken within infrastructure of [[United Nations]]. Mainly for individual rights and collective rights to oppressed groups for self-determination.
# Early 1970s onwards, there was a renewed interest in [[minority rights|rights of minorities]], including language rights of minorities. e.g. UN Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities.

==Theoretical discussion==

===Language rights + human rights = linguistic human rights (LHR)===
Some make a distinction between language rights and linguistic human rights because the former concept covers a much wider scope.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt; Thus, not all language rights are LHR, although all LHR are language rights. One way of distinguishing language rights from LHR is between what is necessary, and what is enrichment-oriented.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt; Necessary rights, as in human rights, are those needed for basic needs and for living a dignified life, e.g. language-related identity, access to mother tongue(s), right of access to an official language, no enforced language shift, access to formal primary education based on language, and the right for minority groups to perpetuate as a distinct group, with own languages. Enrichment rights are above basic needs, e.g. right to learn foreign languages.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt;

===Individual linguistic rights===
The most basic definition of linguistic rights is the right of individuals to use their language with other members of their linguistic group, regardless of the status of their language. They evolve from general human rights, in particular: non-discrimination, freedom of expression, right to private life, and the right of members of a linguistic minority to use their language with other members of their community.&lt;ref name="Varennes,2007"&gt;Varennes, Fernand de. (2007). "Language Rights as an Integral Part of Human Rights – A Legal Perspective". In Koenig, Matthias, Guchteneire, Paul F. A. (eds), ''Democracy and human rights in multicultural societies'' (pp 115–125): Ashgate Publishing Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual linguistic rights are provided for in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]:
* Article 2 – all individuals are entitled to the rights declared without discrimination based on language.
* Article 10 – individuals are entitled to a fair trial, and this is generally recognized to involve the right to an interpreter if an individual does not understand the language used in criminal court proceedings, or in a criminal accusation. The individual has the right to have the interpreter translate the proceedings, including court documents.
* Article 19 – individuals have the right to [[freedom of expression]], including the right to choose any language as the medium of expression.
* Article 26 – everyone has the [[right to education]], with relevance to the language of medium of instruction.
Linguistic rights can be applied to the private arena and the public domain.

====Private use of language====
Most treaties or language rights documents distinguish between the private use of a language by individuals and the use of a language by public authorities.&lt;ref name="Varennes,2007"/&gt; Existing international human rights mandate that all individuals have the right to private and family life, freedom of expression, non-discrimination and/or the right of persons belonging to a linguistic minority to use their language with other members of their group. The [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] defines privacy as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"... the sphere of a person's life in which he or she can freely express his or her identity, be it by entering into relationships with others or alone. The Committee is of the view that a person's surname [and name] constitutes an important component of one's identity and that the protection against arbitrary or unlawful interference with one's privacy includes the protection against arbitrary or unlawful interference with the right to choose and change one's own name."&lt;ref name="Varennes,2007"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This means that individuals have the right to have their name or surname in their own language, regardless of whether the language is official or recognised, and state or public authorities cannot interfere with this right arbitrarily or unlawfully.&lt;br&gt;

====Linguistic rights in the public domain====
The public domain, with respect to language use, can be divided into judicial proceedings and general use by public officials.&lt;br&gt;

According to Article 10 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], individuals have the right to a fair trial. Therefore, in the name of fairness of judicial proceedings, it is an established linguistic right of an individual to an interpreter when he or she does not understand the language used in criminal court proceedings, or in a criminal accusation. The public authorities must either use the language which the individual understands, or hire an interpreter to translate the proceedings, including court cases.

General use by public officials can cover matters including public education, public radio and television broadcasting, the provision of services to the public, and so on. It is often accepted to be reasonable and justified for public officials to use the language of minorities, to an appropriate degree and level in their activities, when the numbers and geographic concentration of the speakers of a minority language are substantial enough. However, this is a contentious topic as the decision of substantiation is often arbitrary. The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], Article 26, does promise to protect all individuals from discrimination on the grounds of language. Following that, Article 27 declares, "[[minority group|minorities]] shall not be denied the right... to use their own language".&lt;ref name="International Covenant"&gt;Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. "International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights". March 23, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]], Article 5, also does declares the rights for minorities to "use or teach their own language".&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention against Discrimination in Education]], Article 5, (c)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collective linguistic rights===
Collective linguistic rights are linguistic rights of a group, notably a language group or a [[state (polity)|state]]. Collective rights mean "the right of a linguistic group to ensure the survival of its language and to transmit the language to future generations".&lt;ref name="Chen, 1998"&gt;Chen, Albert H. Y. "The Philosophy of Language Rights." Language Sciences, 20(1), 45–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Language groups are complex and more difficult to demarcate than states.&lt;ref name="Coulmas, 1998"&gt;Coulmas, Florian. (1998). "Language Rights – Interests of State, Language Groups and the Individual." Language Sciences,20(1), 63–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this difficulty is that members within language groups assign different roles to their language, and there are also difficulties in defining a language.&lt;ref name="Coulmas, 1998"/&gt; Some states have legal provisions for the safeguard of collective linguistic rights because there are clear-cut situations under particular historical and social circumstances.&lt;ref name="Coulmas, 1998"/&gt; &lt;br&gt;

Collective linguistic rights apply to states because they express themselves in one or more languages.&lt;ref name="Coulmas, 1998"/&gt; Generally, the language régime of states, which is communicated through allocation of statuses to languages used within its boundaries, qualifies linguistic rights claimed by groups and individuals in the name of efficient governance, in the best interest of the [[common good]].&lt;ref name="Coulmas, 1998"/&gt; States are held in check by international conventions and the demands of the citizens. Linguistic rights translate to laws differently from country to country, as there is no generally accepted standard legal definition.&lt;ref name="Paulston, 1997"&gt;Paulston, Christina Bratt. "Language Policies and Language Rights". Annual Review Anthropology, 26, 73–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Territoriality vs. personality principles===
The principle of territoriality refers to linguistic rights being focused solely within a territory, whereas the principle of personality depends on the linguistic status of the person(s) involved.&lt;ref name="Paulston, 1997"/&gt; An example of the application of territoriality is the case of [[Switzerland]], where linguistic rights are defined within clearly divided language-based cantons. An example of the application of personality is in federal [[Canadian legislation]], which grants the right to services in French or English regardless of territory.&lt;br&gt;

===Negative vs. positive rights===
[[Negative and positive rights|Negative linguistic rights]] mean the right for the exercise of language without the interference of the [[Sovereign state|State]].&lt;ref name="Chen, 1998"/&gt; Positive linguistic rights require positive action by the State involving the use of public money, such as public education in a specific language, or state-provided services in a particular language.&lt;ref name="Chen, 1998"/&gt;

===Assimilation-oriented vs. maintenance-oriented===
Assimilation-oriented types of language rights refer to the aim of the law to assimilate all citizens within the country, and range from prohibition to toleration.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt; An example of prohibition type laws is the treatment of [[Kurds]] in [[Turkey]] as well as [[Turkish language|Turks]] in [[Iran]], where they are forbidden to use the Kurdish and Turkish languages respectively. Maintenance-oriented types of language rights refer to laws aiming to enable the maintenance of all languages within a country, and range from permission to promotion. An example of laws that promote language rights is the Basque Normalization Law, where the Basque language is promoted. The neutral point between assimilation-orientation and maintenance-orientation is non-discrimination prescription, which forbids discrimination based on language.

===Overt vs. covert===
Another dimension for analyzing language rights is with degree of overtness and covertness.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt; Degree of overtness refers to the extent laws or covenants are explicit with respect to language rights, and covertness the reverse. For example, Indian laws are overt in promoting language rights, whereas the English Language Amendments to the US Constitution are overt prohibition. The [[Charter of the United Nations]], the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], and the UN [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] all fall under covert toleration.

===Criticisms of the framework of linguistic human rights===
Some have criticized linguistic rights proponents for taking language to be a single coherent construct, pointing out instead, the difference between language and speech communities, and putting too much concern over inter-language discrimination rather than intra-language discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Blommaert, J. (ed.) 1999. "Language Ideological Debates". Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blommaert, J. 2001. "The Asmara Declaration as a sociolinguistic problem: Reflections on scholarship and linguistic rights". Journal of Sociolinguistics 5(1): 131–142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blommaert, J. 2001. "Review of T. Skutnabb-Kangas' Linguistic genocide in education – or worldwide diversity and human rights?" Applied Linguistics 22(4): 539–541.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silverstein, M. 1998. "Contemporary transformation of local linguistic communities". Annual Review of Anthropology 27: 401–426.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wee, L. (2005). "Intra-Language Discrimination and Linguistic Human Rights: The Case of Singlish". Applied Linguistics 26(1): 48–69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Other issues pointed out are the assumptions that the collective aims of linguistic minority groups are uniform, and that the concept of collective rights is not without its problems.&lt;ref&gt;May, S. (2001). "Language and Minority Rights: Ethnicity, Nationalism and the Politics of Language". London: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

There is also the protest against the framework of Linguistic Human Rights singling out minority languages for special treatment, causing limited resources to be distributed unfairly. This has led to a call for deeper ethnographic and historiographic study into the relationship between speakers' attitudes, speakers' meaning, language, power, and speech communities.&lt;ref&gt;Stroud, C. (2001). "African mother-tongue programmes and the politics of language: Linguistic citizenship versus linguistic human rights". Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development 22(4): 339–355.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stroud, C. (2002).

Linguistic rights manifest as legislation (the passing of a law), subsequently becoming a statute to be enforced.&lt;ref name="Siegel,2006"&gt;Siegel, Lawrence. (2006). "The Argument for a Constitutional Right to Communication and Language". Sign Language Studies,6(1),255–272.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paulston,1997a"&gt;Christina Bratt Paulston. (1997). "Language Policies and Language Rights". Annual Review Anthropology,26,73–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Language legislation delimiting official usage can by grouped into official, institutionalizing, standardizing, and liberal language legislation, based on its function.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"&gt;Skutnabb-Kangas, Tove. (2000). "Linguistic Genocide in Education – or Worldwide Diversity and Human Rights?" Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"Official legislation makes languages official in the domains of legislation, justice, public administration, and education, [commonly according to territoriality and personality]. Various combinations of both principles are also used.... Institutionalizing legislation covers the unofficial domains of labour, communications, culture, commerce, and business...."&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In relation to legislation, a causal effect of linguistic rights is [[language policy]]. The field of language planning falls under language policy. There are 3 types of language planning: status planning (uses of language), acquisition planning (users of language), and corpus planning (language itself).&lt;ref name="Paulston, 1997"/&gt;

===Language rights at international and regional levels===

====International platform====
{{See also|Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights|International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|Convention on the Rights of the Child}}
The Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights was approved on 6 June 1996 in Barcelona, Spain. It was the culmination of work by a committee of 50 experts under the auspices of [[UNESCO]]. Signatories were 220 persons from over 90 states, representing NGOs and International PEN Clubs Centres. This Declaration was drawn up in response to calls for linguistic rights as a fundamental human right at the 12th Seminar of the International Association for the Development of Intercultural Communication and the Final Declaration of the General Assembly of the International Federation of Modern Language Teachers. Linguistic rights in this Declaration stems from the language community, i.e., collective rights, and explicitly includes both regional and immigrant minority languages. &lt;br&gt;

Overall, this document is divided into sections including: Concepts, General Principles, Overall linguistic regime (which covers Public administration and official bodies, Education, Proper names, Communications media and new technologies, Culture, and The socioeconomic sphere), Additional Dispositions, and Final Dispositions. So for instance, linguistic rights are granted equally to all language communities under Article 10, and to everyone, the right to use any language of choice in the private and family sphere under Article 12. Other Articles details the right to use or choice of languages in education, public, and legal arenas.&lt;br&gt;

There are a number of other documents on the international level granting linguistic rights. The UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1966 makes international law provision for protection of minorities. Article 27 states that individuals of linguistic minorities cannot be denied the right to use their own language. &lt;br&gt;

The UN [[Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities]] was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1992. Article 4 makes "certain modest obligations on states".&lt;ref name="Extra and Yağmur,2004"&gt;Extra, G., and Yağmur, K. (2004). "Language rights perspectives". In Extra, G. and Yağmur, K. (Eds.), Urban Multilingualism in Europe: Immigrant Minority Languages at Home and School (pp. 73–92): Multilingual Matters Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; It states that states should provide individuals belonging to minority groups with sufficient opportunities for education in their mother tongue, or instruction with their mother tongue as the medium of instruction. However, this Declaration is non-binding.&lt;br&gt;

A third document adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1989, which makes provisions for linguistic rights is the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In this convention, Articles 29 and 30 declare respect for the child's own cultural identity, language and values, even when those are different from the country of residence, and the right for the child to use his or her own language, in spite of the child's minority or immigrant status.&lt;br&gt;

====Regional platform====

=====Africa=====
{{See also|List of Linguistic Rights in Constitutions (Africa)}}
Linguistic rights in Africa have only come into focus in recent years. In 1963, the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU) was formed to help defend the fundamental human rights of all Africans. It adopted in 1981 the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]], which aims to promote and protect fundamental human rights, including language rights, in Africa. In 2004, fifteen member states ratified the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights Establishing the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights. The Court is a regional, legal platform that monitors and promotes the AU states' compliance with the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. It is currently pending a merger with the [[African Court of Justice|Court of Justice of the African Union]].

In 2001 the President of the Republic of Mali, in conjunction with the OAU, set up the foundation for the [[African Academy of Languages]] (ACALAN) to "work for the promotion and harmonisation of languages in Africa". Along with the inauguration of the Interim Governing Board of the ACALAN, the [[African Union]] declared 2006 as the [[Year of African Languages]] (YOAL).&lt;ref&gt;African Academy of Languages. (2010). Historical Survey of ACALAN. Retrieved November 9, 2010, from http://www.acalan.org/eng/aboutacalan/historique.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the OAU was disbanded and replaced by the African Union (AU). The AU adopted the Constitutive Act previously drawn up by the OAU in 2000. In Article 25, it is stated that the working languages of the Union and its institutions are Arabic, English, French and Portuguese, and if possible, all African languages. The AU also recognizes the national languages of each of its member institutions as stated in their national constitutions. In 2003, the AU adopted a protocol amending the Act such that working languages shall be renamed as official languages, and would encompass Spanish, Kiswahili and "any other African language" in addition to the four aforementioned languages . However, this Amendment has yet to be put into force, and the AU continues to use only the four working languages for its publications.

=====Europe=====
{{See also|European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages|Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities|List of Linguistic Rights in Constitutions (Europe)}}
The [[Council of Europe]] adopted the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in 1950, which makes some reference to linguistic rights. In Article 5.2, reasons for arrest and charges have to be communicated in a language understood by the person. Secondly, Article 6.3 grants an interpreter for free in a court, if the language used cannot be spoken or understood.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Convention,1950"&gt;Council of Europe. (1950). Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. from http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The Council for Local and Regional Authorities, part of the Council of Europe, formulated the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in 1992.&lt;ref name="Charter,1992"&gt;Council of Europe. (1992). European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. from http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/148.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; This Charter grants recognition, protection, and promotion to regional and/or minority languages in European states, though explicitly not immigrant languages, in domains of "education, judicial authorities, administrative and public services, media, cultural activities, and socio-economic life"&lt;ref name="Extra and Yağmur,2004"/&gt; in Articles 8 to 13. Provisions under this Charter are enforced every three years by a committee. States choose which regional and/or minority languages to include.&lt;br&gt;

The Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities was implemented by the Council of Europe in 1995 as a "parallel activity"&lt;ref name="Extra and Yağmur,2004"/&gt; to the Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. This Framework makes provisions for the right of national minorities to preserve their language in Article 5, for the encouragement of "mutual respect and understanding and co-operation among all persons living on their territory",&lt;ref name="Framework,1995"&gt;Council of Europe. (1995). Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. from http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/157.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of language, especially in "fields of education, culture and the media"&lt;ref name="Framework,1995"/&gt; in Article 6. Article 6 also aims to protect persons from discrimination based on language. &lt;br&gt;

Another document adopted by the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly in 1998 is the Recommendation 1383 on Linguistic Diversification.&lt;ref name="Recommendation 1383,1998"&gt;Parliamentary Assembly – Council of Europe. (1998). Recommendation 1383 (1998) – Linguistic diversification. from http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta98/EREC1383.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; It encourages a wider variety of languages taught in Council of Europe member states in Article 5. It also recommends language education to include languages of non-native groups in Article 8.

===Language rights in different countries===

====Australia====
{{See also|Australian Aboriginal languages}}
[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann]] et al. (2014) proposed the enactment of "Native Tongue Title", an ex gratia compensation scheme for the loss of indigenous languages in Australia: "Although some Australian states have enacted ex gratia compensation schemes for the victims of the [[Stolen Generations]] policies, the victims of [[language death|linguicide]] (language killing) are largely overlooked ... Existing grant schemes to support Aboriginal languages ... should be complemented with compensation schemes, which are based on a claim of '''right'''. The proposed compensation scheme for the loss of Aboriginal languages should support the effort to reclaim and revive the lost languages.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 55 of [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]], Shakuto-Neoh, Shiori &amp; Quer, Giovanni Matteo (2014), [http://www.professorzuckermann.com/#!native-tongue-title/cufd Native Tongue Title: Proposed Compensation for the Loss of Aboriginal Languages], ''Australian Aboriginal Studies'' 2014/1: 55–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, 2017, the [[New South Wales]] (NSW) parliament passed a legislation that recognises and revives indigenous languages for the first time in Australia's history. "The NSW Government will appoint independent panel of Aboriginal language experts" and "establish languages centres".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-11/nsw-passes-unprecedented-laws-to-revive-indigenous-languages/9039746 NSW introduces nation's first laws to recognise and revive Indigenous languages], Bridget Brennan, ABC, October 11, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Austria====
{{See also|Constitution of Austria}}
Under the Austrian Constitutional Law (1867), Article 8(2) grants the right to maintenance and development of nationality and language to all ethnic minorities, equal rights to all languages used within the regions in domains of education, administration and public life, as well as the right to education in their own language for ethnic communities, without the necessity of acquiring a second language used in the province.&lt;ref name="OBVG,2000"&gt;Federal Assembly. (2000). Austrian Federal Constitutional Laws (selection).Herausgegeben vom Bundespressedienst.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
{{See also|Constitution of Canada}}
The [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] (1982) grants positive linguistic rights, by guaranteeing state responsibility to the French and English language communities. Section 23 declares three types of rights for Canadian citizens speaking French or English as their mother tongue and are minorities in a region.&lt;ref name="Constitution,1982"&gt;The Constitution Act. (1982). Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Retrieved Nov 5, 2010, from http://www.efc.ca/pages/law/charter/charter.text.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The first accords right of access to instruction in the medium of the mother tongue. The second assures educational facilities for minority languages. The third endows French and English language minorities the right to maintain and develop their own educational facilities. This control can take the form of "exclusive decision-making authority over the expenditure of funds, the appointment and direction of the administration, instructional programs, the recruitment of teachers and personnel, and the making of agreements for education and services".&lt;ref name="Martel,1999"&gt;Martel, Angéline.

Hungary: Central European University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these rights apply to primary and secondary education, sustained on public funds, and depend on the numbers and circumstances.

====Croatia====
{{Main article|Minority languages of Croatia}}
[[File:Croatia minority languages 2011.jpg|thumb|Minority languages in Croatia (official use at local level)]]
[[Croatian language]] is the stated to be the official language of Croatia in Article 3 of the Croatian constitution. The same Article of Constitution stipulates that in some of local units, with the Croatian language and [[Latin script]], in official use may be introduce another language and [[Cyrillic]] or some other script under the conditions prescribed by law. The only example of the use of minority language at the regional level currently is [[Istria County]] where official languages are Croatian and [[Italian language|Italian]]. In eastern Croatia, in [[Joint Council of Municipalities]], at local (municipal) level is introduced [[Serbian language|Serbian]] as co official language. Each municipality, where a certain minority has more than one third of the population, can if it wants to introduce a minority language in official use.

====Finland====
{{See also|Constitution of Finland}}
Finland has one of the most overt linguistic rights frameworks.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt; Discrimination based on language is forbidden under the basic rights for all citizens in [[Finland]]. Section 17 of the Constitution of Finland explicitly details the right to one's language and culture, although these languages are stated as either Finnish or Swedish. This right applies to in courts of law and other authorities, as well as translated official documents. There is also overt obligation of the state to provide for the "cultural and societal needs of the Finnish-speaking and Swedish-speaking populations of the country on an equal basis".&lt;ref name="Finland Constitution"&gt;Parliament of Finland. (1999). The Constitution of Finland.&lt;/ref&gt; Other language communities, the ones specifically mentioned are indigenous groups, are granted the right to maintenance and development of their own language. There is an additional right for the specific group, the Sami, that they may use the Sami language when communicating with authorities. The deaf community is also granted the right to sign language and interpretation or translation. &lt;br&gt;

Regulations regarding the rights of linguistic minorities in Finland, insist on the forming of a district for the first 9 years of comprehensive school education in each language, in municipalities with both Finnish- and Swedish-speaking children, as long as there is a minimum of 13 students from the language community of that mother tongue.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Svenska"&gt;Svenska Finlands Folkting.

====India====
{{See also|Constitution of India}}
The constitution of India was first drafted on January 26, 1950. It is estimated that there are about 1500 languages in India. Article 343–345 declared that the official languages of India for communication with centre will be Hindi and English. There are 22 official languages identified by constitution.  Article 345 states that "the Legislature of a state may by law adopt any one or more of the languages in use in the State or Hindi as the language or languages to be used for all or any of the official purposes of that State: Provided that, until the Legislature of the State otherwise provides by law, the English language shall continue to be used for those official purposes within the State for which it was being used immediately before the commencement of this Constitution".&lt;ref&gt;Groff, C. (2003). Status and acquisition planning and linguistic minorities in India. Online&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ireland====
{{See also|Languages of Ireland}}

Language rights in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] are recognised in the [[Constitution of Ireland]] and in the Official Languages Act.

[[Irish language|Irish]] is the national and first official language according to the Constitution (with English being a second official language). The Constitution permits the public to conduct its business – and every part of its business – with the state solely through Irish.

On 14 July 2003, the [[President of Ireland]] signed the [[Official Languages Act 2003]] into law and the provisions of the Act were gradually brought into force over a three-year period. The Act sets out the duties of public bodies regarding the provision of services in Irish and the rights of the public to avail of those services.

The use of Irish on the country's traffic signs is the most visible illustration of the state's policy regarding the official languages. It is a statutory requirement that placenames on signs be in both Irish and English except in the [[Gaeltacht]], where signs are in Irish only.

====Mexico====
{{See also|Languages of Mexico}}

Language rights were recognized in Mexico in 2003 with the [[Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas|General Law of Linguistic Rights for the Indigenous Peoples]] which established a framework for the conservation, nurturing and development of indigenous languages. It recognizes the countries Many indigenous languages as coofficial National languages, and obligates government to offer all public services in indigenous languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pellicer, Dora   |author2=Bábara Cifuentes |author3=Carmen Herrera  |year=2006 |chapter=Legislating diversity in twenty-first century Mexico |title=Mexican Indigenous Languages at the Dawn of the Twenty-first Century |editor=Margarita G.

====Pakistan====
{{see also|Languages of Pakistan}}
Pakistan uses English ([[Pakistani English]]) and [[Urdu]] as official languages. Although Urdu serves as the national language and lingua franca and is understood by most of the population, it is natively spoken by only 8% of the population. English is not natively used as a first language, but, for official purposes, about 49% of the population is able to communicate in some form of English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/sites/teacheng/files/Euromonitor%20Report%20A4.pdf|title=The Benefits of the English Language for Individuals and Societies: Quantitative Indicators from Cameroon, Nigeria, Rwanda, Bangladesh and Pakistan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, major regional languages like [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] (spoken by the majority of the population), [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Saraiki dialect|Saraiki]], [[Hindko]], [[Balochi language|Balochi]], [[Brahui language|Brahui]] and [[Shina language|Shina]] have no official status at the federal level.

====Philippines====
{{see also|Languages of the Philippines}}
Article XIV, Sections 6–9 of the 1987 Philippine constitution mandate the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/constitutions/1987-constitution/|title=The Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines|date=February 2, 1987|work=Official Gazette|publisher=Government of the Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*SECTION 6. The national language of the Philippines is Filipino. As it evolves, it shall be further developed and enriched on the basis of existing Philippine and other languages.

:*SECTION 9. The Congress shall establish a national language commission composed of representatives of various regions and disciplines which shall undertake, coordinate, and promote researches for the development, propagation, and preservation of Filipino and other languages.

====Poland====

The Republic of Poland declares that it shall apply the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] in accordance with the Act on national and ethnic minorities and on regional language, dated 6 January 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ListeDeclarations.asp?NT=148&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=23/01/05&amp;CL=ENG&amp;VL=1|title=Search on Treaties|website=Treaty Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====

{{See also|Constitution of Spain}}
Spanish language is the stated to be the official language of Spain in Article 3 of the Spanish constitution, being the learning of this language compulsory by this same article. However, the constitution makes provisions for other languages of Spain to be official in their respective communities. An example would be the use of the Basque language in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community (BAC)]].&lt;ref name="Urla,1988"/&gt; Apart from Spanish, the other co-official languages are Basque, Catalan and Galician.&lt;ref&gt;CIA World Factbook.

====Sweden====

In ratifying the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], Sweden declared five national minority languages: [[Sami languages|Saami]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Meänkieli]], [[Romani language|Romani]], and Yiddish.&lt;ref&gt;SFS 1999:1175.

====United States====

{{See also|Constitution of the United States}}
Language rights in the [[United States]] are usually derived from the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], with its Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses, because they forbid racial and ethnic discrimination, allowing language minorities to use this Amendment to claim their language rights.&lt;ref name="Del Valle,2003"&gt;Del Valle, Sandra. (2003). "Language Rights and the Law in the United States: Finding our Voices." Multilingual Matters Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; One example of use of the Due Process Clauses is the ''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'' case which held that a 1919 Nebraska law restricting foreign-language education violated the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Two other cases of major importance to linguistic rights were the ''[[Yu Cong Eng v. Trinidad]]'' case, which overturned a language-restrictive legislation in the [[Philippines]], declaring that piece of legislation to be "violative of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Philippine Autonomy Act of Congress",&lt;ref name="Del Valle,2003"/&gt; as well as the ''[[Farrington v. Tokushige]]'' case, which ruled that the governmental regulation of private schools, particularly to restrict the teaching of languages other than English and [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], as damaging to the migrant population of [[Hawaii]]. Both of these cases were influenced by the Meyer case, which was a precedent.&lt;ref name="Del Valle,2003"/&gt;

===Disputes over linguistic rights===

====Basque, Spain====
{{See also|Basque language}}
The linguistic situation for Basque is a precarious one. The Basque language is considered to be a low language in [[Spain]], where, until about 1982, the Basque language was not used in administration.&lt;ref name="Urla,1988"&gt;Urla, J. (1988). Ethnic Protest and Social Planning: A Look at Basque Language Revival. Cultural Anthropology , 379–394.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, a law was passed allowing for Basque to be used in administration side by side with Spanish in the Basque autonomous communities.&lt;ref name="Urla,1988"/&gt;

Between 1935 and 1975, the period of Franco's régime, the use of Basque was strictly prohibited, and thus language decline begun to occur as well.&lt;ref name="Gardner,2002"&gt;Gardner, N. (2002). BASQUE IN EDUCATION: IN THE BASQUE AUTONOMOUS COMMUNITY. Department of Culture Basque Government. Euskal Autonomia Erkidegoko Administrazioa Hezkuntza, Unibertsitate eta Ikerketa Saila.&lt;/ref&gt; However, following the death of Franco, many Basque nationalists demanded that the Basque language be recognized.&lt;ref name="Gardner,2002"/&gt; One of these groups was Euskadi Ta Askatasun ([[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]). ETA had initially begun as a nonviolent group to promote Basque language and culture.&lt;ref name="Gardner,2002"/&gt; However, when its demands were not met, it turned violent and evolved into violent separatist groups. Today, ETA's demands for a separate state stem partially from the problem of perceived linguistic discrimination.&lt;ref name="Gardner,2002"/&gt; However, ETA called a permanent cease-fire in October 2011.

====Faroe Islands====
{{See also|Faroese language conflict}}
The [[Faroese language]] conflict, which occurred roughly between 1908 and 1938, has been described as political and cultural in nature. The two languages competing to become the official language of the Faroe Islands were Faroese and Danish. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the language of the government, education and Church was Danish, whereas Faroese was the language of the people. The movement towards Faroese language rights and preservation was begun in the 1880s by a group of students. This spread from 1920 onwards to a movement towards using Faroese in the religious and government sector. Faroese and Danish are now both official languages in the Faroe Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Poulsen, J. H. (1999). On Faroese Language Planning. In G.

The [[Newar]]s of [[Nepal]] have been struggling to save their [[Nepal Bhasa]] language, culture and identity since the 1920s. Nepal Bhasa was suppressed during the [[Rana dynasty|Rana]] (1846–1951) and [[Panchayat (Nepal)|Panchayat]] (1960–1990) regimes leading to language decline. The Ranas forbade writing in [[Nepal Bhasa]] and authors were jailed or exiled. Beginning in 1965, the Panchayat system eased out regional languages from the radio and educational institutions, and protestors were put in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shrestha|first=Bal Gopal|title=The Newars: The Indigenous Population of the Kathmandu Valley in the Modern State of Nepal |url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_26_01_04.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2012|newspaper=CNAS Journal|date=January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the reinstatement of democracy in 1990, restrictions on publishing were relaxed; but attempts to gain usage in local state entities side by side with [[Nepali language|Nepali]] failed. On 1 June 1999, the Supreme Court forbade [[Kathmandu]] Metropolitan City from giving official recognition to Nepal Bhasa, and [[Rajbiraj]] Municipality and [[Dhanusa District|Dhanusa]] District Development Committee from recognizing [[Maithili language|Maithili]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Tumbahang | first = Govinda Bahadur | url = http://tujournal.edu.np/index.php/TUJ/article/view/18/16| title = Process of Democratization and Linguistic (Human) Rights in Nepal| work =Tribhuvan University Journal | pages =18–19 | date= September 2009| accessdate = 20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Interim Constitution of Nepal 2007 recognizes all the languages spoken as mother tongues in Nepal as the national languages of Nepal. It says that Nepali in [[Devanagari]] script shall be the language of official business, however, the use of mother tongues in local bodies or offices shall not be considered a barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sambidhan.org/Constitution%202063%20English-07/Part%201.pdf |title=The Interim Constitution of Nepal 2007|publisher=Constitution Forum |accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of national languages in local government bodies has not happened in practice, and discouragement in their use and discrimination in allocation of resources persist. Some analysts have stated that one of the chief causes of the Maoist insurgency, or the [[Nepalese Civil War]] (1996–2006), was the denial of language rights and marginalization of ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalhimalaya.com/projectteam/turin/downloads/MRD.pdf |title= Mountain Research and Development |publisher= United Nations University and International Mountain Society |page=7 |accessdate=20 September 2013|date= February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sri Lanka====
{{See also|Sinhala Only Act}}

The start of the conflict regarding languages in [[Sri Lanka]] goes as far back as the rule of the British. During the colonial period, English had a special and powerful position in Sri Lanka. The British ruled in Sri Lanka from the late eighteenth century to 1948.  English was the official language of administration then. Just before the departure of the British, a "swabhasha" (your own language) movement was launched in a bid to phase out English slowly, replacing it with [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] or [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. However, shortly after the departure of the British the campaign, for various political reasons, evolved from advocating Sinhala and Tamil replacing English to just Sinhala replacing English.

In 1956, the first election after independence, the opposition won and the official language was declared to be Sinhala. The Tamil people were unhappy, feeling that they were greatly disadvantaged. Because Sinhala was now the official language, it made it easier for the people whose mother tongue was Sinhala to enter into government sector and also provided them with an unfair advantage in the education system. Tamils who also did not understand Sinhala felt greatly inconvenienced as they had to depend on others to translate official documents for them.

Both the Tamil and Sinhala-speaking people felt that language was crucial to their identity. The Sinhala people associated the language with their rich heritage. They were also afraid that, given that there were only 9 million speakers of the language at that time, if Sinhala was not the only official language it would eventually be slowly lost.&lt;ref name="Kearney,1978"/&gt; The Tamil people felt that the Sinhala-only policy would assert the dominance of the Sinhalese people and as such they might lose their language, culture and identity.&lt;ref name="Kearney,1978"/&gt;

Despite the unhappiness of the Tamil people, no big political movement was undertaken till the early 1970s. Eventually in May 1976, there was a public demand for a Tamil state. During the 1956 election the Federal party had replaced the Tamil congress. The party was bent on "the attainment of freedom for the Tamil-speaking people of Ceylon by the establishment of an autonomous Tamil state on the linguistic basis within the framework of a Federal Union of Ceylon".&lt;ref name="Kearney,1978"/&gt; However it did not have much success. Thus in 1972, the Federal Party, Tamil Congress and other organizations banded together into a new party called the "Tamil United Front".

One of the catalysts for Tamil separation arose in 1972 when the Sinhala government made amendments to the constitution. The Sinhala government decided to promote Buddhism as the official religion, claiming that "it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster Buddhism".&lt;ref name="Kearney,1978"/&gt; Given that the majority of the Tamils were Hindus, this created unease. There was then a fear among the Tamils that people belonging to the "untouchable castes" would be encouraged to convert to Buddhism and then "brainwashed" to learn Sinhala as well.&lt;ref name="Kearney,1978"/&gt;

Another spur was also the impatience of Tamil youth in Sri Lanka. Veteran politicians noted that current youths were more ready to engage in violence, and some of them even had ties to certain rebel groups in South India. Also in 1974, there was conference of Tamil studies organized in [[Jaffna]]. The conference turned violent. This resulted in the deaths of seven people. Consequently, about 40 – 50 Tamil youths in between the years of 1972 and 1975 were detained without being properly charged, further increasing tension.

A third stimulus was the changes in the criteria for University examinations in the early 1970s. The government decided that they wanted to standardize the university admission criteria, based on the language the entrance exams were taken in. It was noted that students who took the exams in Tamil scored better than the students who took it in Sinhala. Thus the government decided that Tamil students had to achieve a higher score than the students who took the exam in Sinhala to enter the universities. As a result, the number of Tamil students entering universities fell.

After the July 1977 election, relations between the Sinhalese and the Ceylon Tamil people became worse. There was flash violence in parts of the country. It is estimated about 100 people were killed and thousands of people fled from their homes. Among all these tensions, the call for a separate state among Tamil people grew louder.&lt;ref name="Kearney,1978"&gt;Kearney, R. (1978). Language and the Rise of Tamil Separatism in Sri Lanka. Asian Survey, 18(5), 521–534.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martin James McSorley''' (born May 18, 1963) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] former professional [[ice hockey|hockey]] player, who played in the [[National Hockey League]] from 1983 until 2000. A versatile player, he was able to play both the forward and defense positions.

A former [[head coach]] of the Springfield Falcons of the [[American Hockey League]] (2002–04), aside from his hockey career, McSorley has  worked as an actor, appearing in several film and television roles. McSorley was a valued teammate of [[Wayne Gretzky]] during their years playing together for the [[Edmonton Oilers]] and [[Los Angeles Kings]], where he served as an [[Enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcer]]. In [[1999–2000 NHL season|2000]], his on-ice assault of [[Donald Brashear]] with his stick, in which Brashear suffered a severe concussion, led to McSorley's suspension and eventual retirement from the NHL.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/story?id=100318&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life and hockey career===
McSorley was born in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], but grew up near [[Cayuga, Ontario|Cayuga, Haldimand County, Ontario]]. He made his NHL debut in October 1983 with the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], but rose to fame after a trade in September 1985 brought him to the [[Edmonton Oilers]]. His arrival and physical presence soon made Edmonton's incumbent enforcer [[Dave Semenko]] expendable, and McSorley inherited the title of "[[Wayne Gretzky]]'s bodyguard".&lt;ref name="lakingslegends.blogspot.com"/&gt;

This title would follow him to Los Angeles in 1988, when both he and Gretzky, along with [[Mike Krushelnyski]], were obtained by the [[Los Angeles Kings|Kings]]. With the Kings, McSorley's bruising style made him a fan favorite; but he strove to improve his game beyond being primarily known as an enforcer, earning great respect around the league for his hard work ethic, his fine team play, and his articulate intelligence off the ice.&lt;ref name="lakingslegends.blogspot.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lakingslegends.blogspot.com/2008/06/marty-mcsorley.html|first=Joe|last=Pelletier|title=Los Angeles Kings legends: Marty McSorley|work=Greatest Hockey Legends.Com|date=5 June 2011|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1992–93 NHL regular season, McSorley led all defensemen in shorthanded goals with three.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1993_skaters.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kings reached the [[1993 Stanley Cup Finals]] against the [[Montreal Canadiens]], but in Game 2 with the Kings up 2–1, McSorley was caught with an illegal stick, contributing to the Canadiens game-tying goal. Montreal ending up winning that game in overtime and ultimately took the series in five games. McSorley otherwise had ten points in the playoffs, and was the only King to score during the final game. Some suggested that he was the second most dominant King after Gretzky in the playoffs.&lt;ref name="lakingslegends.blogspot.com"/&gt;

McSorley remained with the Kings until an August 1993 trade sent him to [[Pittsburgh Penguins|Pittsburgh]] in exchange for offensive forward [[Shawn McEachern]]; however, his stay in Pittsburgh would be brief (only 47 games). The Kings re-acquired him on February 16, 1994.&lt;ref name=melrose&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/blogpost.htm?id=14845|title=O'Reilly situation is nothing new|author=Barry Melrose|publisher=nhl.com|date=March 4, 2013|accessdate=February 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back with the Kings, he assisted on Gretzky's goal which broke [[Gordie Howe]]'s all-time goal-scoring record. On March 14, 1996, McSorley left the Kings' organization for good, traded to the [[New York Rangers]] as part of a multi-player deal.

After completing the [[1995-96 NHL season|1995–96 season]] with the Rangers, McSorley returned to the West Coast after being acquired by the [[San Jose Sharks]] in August 1996. He spent two injury-plagued seasons with the Sharks before returning to Edmonton as a free agent in October 1998. Confined to a part-time role in his second stint in Edmonton, he left after one season and signed with the [[Boston Bruins]] in December 1999.  As a Bruin, his NHL career would come to a sudden and infamous end in a game against the [[Vancouver Canucks]] on February 21, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/19/sports/hockey-mcsorley-s-stormy-career-makes-track-change-in-springfield.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assault conviction====
In a game between the Bruins and the [[Vancouver Canucks|Canucks]] in [[Vancouver]] on February 21, 2000, McSorley swung his stick and hit [[Donald Brashear]] in the head with 4.6 seconds left in the game. Brashear fell backwards and hit his head hard on the ice, losing consciousness and suffering a Grade III [[concussion]]. McSorley was charged with assault and suspended by the NHL for the remainder of the 1999–2000 season (including the playoffs) missing 23 games. On October 6, 2000, Judge William Kitchen of the [[Provincial Court of British Columbia]] found him guilty of [[aggravated assault|assault with a weapon]] for his attack on Brashear. He was sentenced to 18 months probation. The trial was the first for an on-ice attack by an NHL player since [[Dino Ciccarelli]]'s 1988 trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/story?id=100318&amp;page=1#.T81P58WuXh5|title=NHL Player Found Guilty of Assault|work=ESPN Sports |publisher=ABCNews.com|date=6 October 2000|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his assault conviction, his NHL suspension was extended to one full year through February 21, 2001.&lt;ref name='ABCNews-Nov-7-2000'&gt;{{cite news|title=McSorley Suspended From NHL Until Feb.|date=2000-11-07|work=ABC News|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/story?id=100192&amp;page=1#.T81KPMWuXh4|accessdate=June 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   McSorley would never play in another NHL game.

====United Kingdom====
During his suspension, he attempted to continue playing hockey in the United Kingdom with the [[London Knights (UK)|London Knights]], where his elder brother Chris was coaching, but this move was blocked by the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]], in deference to the NHL suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2001/01/23/soice24.xml|title=Ice Hockey: McSorley foiled by ban|publisher=Telegraph|first=Paul|last=Newman|date=January 23, 2001|accessdate=February 23, 2015|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar intention to play in Germany for the [[Munich Barons]] also failed, but he then played for the [[Grand Rapids Griffins]] in their final [[International Hockey League (1945-2001)|IHL]] season, dressing for 14 games.

In the autumn of 2001, following the completion of his suspension, McSorley again looked towards the other side of the Atlantic. He considered purchasing the then struggling [[Cardiff Devils]] team with his brother,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1644089.stm|title=Hardman McSorley dices with Devils|publisher=BBC News|date=8 November 2001|accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to pursue a new player-coach role and to develop interest in the sport in the UK.

McSorley appeared as a guest player for both [[Great Britain national ice hockey team|Great Britain]] and the Cardiff Devils during a series of games in November 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/wales/1640600.stm|title=Ice fans snap up tickets|publisher=BBC News|date=November 6, 2001|accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the business deal failed to materialise.

===Coaching career===
McSorley coached the [[American Hockey League]] team the [[Springfield Falcons]] between 2002 and 2004.

===Film and TV career===
From 1995 to 1997, McSorley also appeared in four movies in small roles: ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]'' (1995), ''[[Forget Paris]]'' (1995), ''[[Con Air]]'' (1997) and ''[[Do Me A Favor (film)|Do Me A Favor]]'' (1997).

During the [[2005–06 NHL season]], McSorley worked for [[Fox Sports West]] in [[Los Angeles]], providing in-studio analysis of games involving the [[Los Angeles Kings]] or the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]]. He provided color commentary for the [[San Jose Sharks]] games on FSN Bay Area during [[2006–07 NHL season]]. McSorley's time in that role ended mysteriously midway through the Sharks playoff series with Detroit, when the Sharks announced McSorley would not return for a Game 3 broadcast for personal reasons. No further explanation was given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bayarearidersforum.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-213441.html|title=Popular Sharks TV analyst is back|work=San Jose Mercury News|first=David|last=Pollak|date=Aug 2, 2007|publisher=BARF-Bay Area Riders Forum-Community-Kitchen Sink blog|accessdate=2012-06-04}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He appeared in one episode of [[Urban Hellraisers (CSI Episode)|''CSI: Miami'']] in 2005 as rink manager Andrew Greven. On July 30, 2007, McSorley guest starred on [[ABC Family]]'s [[Greek (TV series)|''Greek'']] as himself playing a hockey goaltender. In February 2008, McSorley was featured as one of the pros on ''[[Pros vs Joes]]'' on [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike TV]].

Canadian singer-songwriter [[Kathleen Edwards]] referred to McSorley in her song "[[Asking for Flowers|I Make the Dough, You Get the Glory]]", with the lyric, "You're the [[Wayne Gretzky|Great One]], I'm Marty McSorley..., I make the dough, but you get the glory." McSorley appears in the song's [[music video]].&lt;ref name="nhl_ke"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ottawa singer Kathleen Edwards teams up with former NHL-ers for new video|url=https://www.nhl.com/news/ottawa-singer-kathleen-edwards-teams-up-with-former-nhl-ers-for-new-video/c-378371|website=NHL.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McSorley is currently a TV analyst for [[Sportsnet]] and occasionally ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]''. He is a regular at [[Staples Center]] during Kings hockey games.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/kings/story/2012-05-27/marty-mcsorley-illegal-stick-curse/55238940/1 McSorley profile], usatoday30.usatoday.com; accessed February 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
McSorley currently resides in [[Hermosa Beach, CA|Hermosa Beach]], [[California]]. He married beach volleyball player [[Leanne Schuster]] in August 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bvbinfo.com/player.asp?ID=1195 |title=Leanne Schuster: Career |work=Beach Volleyball Database |accessdate=February 23, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223190455/http://www.bvbinfo.com/player.asp?ID=1195 |archivedate=February 23, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have three children.&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt;

'''Medical necessity''' is a [[United States]] [[legal doctrine]], related to activities which may be justified as reasonable, necessary, and/or appropriate, based on [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] clinical [[standard of care|standards of care]]. Other countries may have medical doctrines or legal rules covering broadly similar grounds. The term '''clinical medical necessity''' is also used. In contrast, [[unnecessary health care]] lacks such justification.

== Implementations of the 'medical necessity' doctrines ==

=== Medicare ===

[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] pays for medical items and services that are "reasonable and necessary" for a variety of purposes. By statute, Medicare may only pay for items and services that are "reasonable and necessary"for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member", unless there is another statutory authorization for payment.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' 42 U.S.C. &amp;sect; [http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1862.htm 1395y(a)(1)(A)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicare has a number of policies, including [[National coverage determination]]s (NCDs) and [[Local Coverage Determination]]s (LCDs), formerly known as Local Medical Review Policies (LMRP), that describe coverage criteria.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' http://www.cms.hhs.gov/mcd/overview.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

In a small number of cases, Medicare may determine if a method of treating a patient should be covered on a case-by-case basis. Even if a service is medically determined to be "reasonable and necessary," coverage may be limited if the service is provided more frequently than allowed under Medicare coverage policies.&lt;ref&gt;For more information, see [[Certificate of medical necessity]], [http://medicarelaw.info/wiki/Reasonable_and_Necessary]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, or [http://www.gotelecare.com/medical-billing].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific instances==

===Medical use of marijuana===
{{main|Medical cannabis}}
The use of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] (also known as marijuana) for medical purposes is a notable 'medical necessity' case. Cannabis is a plant whose active ingredients are widely reported by sufferers to be effective in pain control for various conditions, usually [[neuropathic]] in nature, where common painkillers have not had great benefit; however as a [[scheduled drug|Schedule I drug]] under the [[Controlled Substance Act]], it is illegal and is targeted by government, police, and anti-drug campaigners: in some states, possession is decriminalized for even non-medical purposes, wherein other states possession is a felony offense. In this case the doctrine of medical necessity would be used by a patient who believed marijuana was beneficial to them if charged with use or growing/production of illegal controlled substance relating to marijuana.

In several medical marijuana cases, the patients' physician has been willing to state to the court that the patient's condition requires this medicine and thus that the Court should not interfere. However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] of United States has outrightly rejected this defense in the landmark case ''[[United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative]]'', in which the Court ruled that there was no medical necessity exception to drug laws, and federal government is free to [[Police raid|raid]], [[arrest]], [[prosecute]], and [[imprison]] patients who are using medical marijuana no matter if the medicine is crucially necessary to them. On the other hand, in ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'', the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals told a sufferer in extreme pain that they could not rely on state law allowing medical use, but if arrested they could seek to use medical necessity as a defence.

In the state of [[Maryland]], a bill signed by former governor [[Robert Ehrlich]], became law in 2003 permitting patients to use medical necessity defense to marijuana possession in the state. The maximum penalty for these users cannot exceed $100. However, this law does not prevent federal prosecution of patients, as the federal law does not recognize medical necessity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23279">{{see also|Unethical human experimentation}}
'''Medical torture''' describes the involvement of, or sometimes instigation by, [[medical personnel]] in acts of [[torture]], either to judge what victims can endure, to apply treatments which will enhance torture, or as torturers in their own right. Medical torture overlaps with '''medical interrogation''' if it involves the use of professional medical expertise to facilitate [[interrogation]] or [[corporal punishment]], in the conduct of torturous [[human experimentation]] or in providing professional medical sanction and approval for the torture of prisoners. Medical torture also covers torturous scientific (or pseudo-scientific) experimentation upon unwilling human subjects.

==Medical ethics and international law==
It is generally accepted that medical torture fundamentally violates [[medical ethics]], which all medical practitioners are expected to adhere to.
* The [[Hippocratic Oath]] makes explicit statements against deliberate harm not in the patient's best interests. These statements are often translated as ''"I will prescribe regimens for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment"'' and ''"to never deliberately do harm to anyone, for anyone else's interest."'' (Note: these statements are formulations of the ethical principles of [[beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]] and [[non-maleficence]].)
* In response to the [[Nazi human experimentation]] on prisoners during [[World War II]], which were declared at the post-World War II [[Nuremberg Trials]] to be "[[crimes against humanity]]", the [[World Medical Association]] developed the [[Declaration of Geneva]] to supplant the dated Hippocratic Oath. The Declaration of Geneva requires medical practitioners to state "&lt;nowiki&gt;[I, the medical practitioner]&lt;/nowiki&gt; will maintain the utmost respect for human life from its beginning even under threat and I will not use my medical knowledge contrary to the laws of humanity."
* The Nuremberg Trials also led to the emergence of the [[Nuremberg code]] which explicitly outlines the boundaries of acceptable medical experimentation.
* Additionally in response to the [[Nazi atrocities]], the [[Geneva Convention]]s of 1949 outright prohibits the torture of [[prisoners of war]] and other protected [[non-combatants]].
* The [[World Medical Association]] [[Declaration of Tokyo (1975)]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/tokyo.html&lt;/ref&gt; makes a number of specific statements against torture, including "The doctor shall not ''countenance'', ''condone'' or ''participate in'' the practice of torture".
* Also the [[UN Convention Against Torture]], which also applies to medical personnel (in addition to [[law enforcement officers]], [[military personnel]], [[politicians]], and other persons acting in an [[official capacity]]), prohibits the use of torture under any circumstance. Under Article 2(2) of the Convention, it states that "No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of [[war]] or a threat of war, internal [[Failed state|political instability]] or any other [[State of Emergency|public emergency]], may be invoked as a justification of torture."
* The UN Principles of Medical Ethics relevant to the Role of Health Personnel, particularly Physicians, in the Protection of Prisoners and Detainees against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (UN.1982) applies specifically to medical and other health workers but it has no implementation mechanism to ensure enforcement. It is up to state, provincial, and national bodies to enforce the standards in the document.
* The development of [[command responsibility]] established [[legal liability|criminal liability]] for all people, including physicians, involved in crimes against humanity.

There remain gaps in regulation relating to medical torture in many countries:

*  Government sponsored torture and organized violence, with the complicity and or participation of health personnel, is internationally prohibited yet these violations occur with impunity in a significant amount of cases. An example of this impunity is found in the [[Abu Ghraib|Abu Ghraib prison]] torture and prisoner scandal as well as documented by [[Amnesty International]].
* A higher standard of behaviour is expected of health professionals yet the [[UN Principles of Medical Ethics]] are not enforceable when governments are complicit in violations. This higher standard is reflected in the principles of beneficence, non-maleficence (above all do no harm), autonomy, justice, dignity and informed consent and these are not covered comprehensively by the [[UN Convention Against Torture]].

==Asserted instances==
* Between 1937 and 1945, Japanese medical personnel who were part of [[Unit 731]] participated in the torture killings of as many as 10,000 Chinese, Russian, American and other prisoners as well as Allied POWs during the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)|second Sino-Japanese War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiipowmia.com/731/731caveat.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430115229/http://www.aiipowmia.com/731/731caveat.html |archivedate=2009-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During [[World War II]], the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime in Germany conducted [[Nazi human experimentation|human medical experimentation]] on large numbers of people held in its concentration camps. In particular, [[Josef Mengele]]'s experiments on prisoners at [[Auschwitz]] earned him the nicknames "the Angel of Death" and "Dr. Death".
* During [[World War II]], the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime in Germany regularly executed prisoners and opponents of the regime. According to some accounts, medical staff was involved in torture during executions. One account of [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]]'s death states that, as doctor at [[Flossenbürg concentration camp]], "Fischer-Hüllstrung had the job of reviving political prisoners after they had been hanged until they were almost dead, in order to prolong the agony of their dying."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2010|author=Ferdinand Schlingensiepen|isbn=0-7735-1531-3|title=Dietrich Bonhoeffer, 1906–1945: Martyr, Thinker, Man of Resistance|publisher=Continuum/T &amp; T Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Japanese surgeons also performed [[vivisection]] and other medical experiments to torture [[United States|American]] prisoners of war in several islands of the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crimesofwar.org/a-z-guide/medical-experiments-on-pows/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Between 1970 and 1971, mentally disorienting interrogation techniques were used against interned prisoners captured in [[Northern Ireland]], including [[white noise]]. The Irish government complained to the [[European Commission for Human Rights]], who found Britain guilty of torture; however the higher [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that the British government's actions were "inhuman and degrading but did not constitute torture".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/war/troubles/origins/internment.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Soviet mental hospitals [[Punitive psychiatry in the Soviet Union|used to hold political prisoners]], very unpleasant medications were given to these "patients" as a means of punishment.  A psychiatric diagnosis was devised to describe people who oppose government policies.
* In 1978, "Pisaot menuh" ("Human Experiments") were performed on seventeen [[political prisoner]]s held at the infamous prison [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum|Tuol Sleng]] in [[Phnom Penh]] under the [[Khmer Rouge]].
* A study called "[[The Aversion Project]]" found that gay conscripts in the [[South African Defence Force]]s (SADF) during the [[apartheid]] era had been forced to submit to "curing" their homosexuality, both by electroshock therapies and by botched [[sex change]]s.
* There have been numerous claims that [[electroconvulsive therapy]] and [[Leukotomy|prefrontal lobotomies]] and similar psychiatric treatments have sometimes been performed not in the patient's best interests, but rather as punishment for misbehaviour or to otherwise make the patient easier to manage. A classic example of this is the Lake Alice, New Zealand atrocity which occurred in the early 1970s. Children admitted to the [[Lake Alice Hospital]]'s open child and adolescent unit were routinely punished with unmodified ECT (that is, [[electroconvulsive therapy#technique|ECT]] without anesthesia). Some governments (e.g. [[Norway]] and [[New Zealand]]) have since begun paying reparations to patients who suffered such treatments. The [[World Health Organization]] has called for a ban on unmodified ECT, and states no form of it should be used on children.
* In 2014, Howard S Schneider, a Jacksonville, Florida pediatric dentist (not to be confused with Howard W Schneider, a pediatric dentist practicing in New York), was accused of [[wikt:sadistic|sadistically]] torturing patients as young as 2. He avoided prosecution by claiming incompetence and is no longer practicing. &lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstcoastnews.com/story/news/local/consumer/on-your-side/2015/05/07/lawsuit-filed-jacksonville-dentist/70950856/|title=Lawsuit alleges torture, abuse, fraud at local dentist's office}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2016, a group consisting of 71 British medical doctors urged that [[Israel]]'s membership in the [[World Medical Association]] should be revoked because Israeli doctors allegedly perform state-endorsed "medical torture" on Palestinians.&lt;ref name="israel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/British-doctors-seek-to-expel-Israel-from-World-Medical-Association-442215|title=British doctors seek to expel Israel from World Medical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asserted medical or professional complicity==
According to the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]]' When Healers Harm campaign, health professionals were complicit in the torture and abuse of detainees during U.S. President [[George W. Bush]]'s "[[war on terror]]".  Health professionals, including medical doctors, psychiatrists, medical examiners, psychologists, and nurses, have been implicated in the torture and abuse of prisoners in [[CIA]] secret prisons and military detention centers, such as those in [[Guantánamo Bay detention camp|Guantánamo]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq]].

Among other things, health professionals are accused of:

* crafting abusive tactics and falsely legitimizing their use;
* advised interrogators on methods of abuse that would exploit prisoners’ vulnerabilities;
* using medical procedures to harm prisoners;
* gauging [[pain]] and monitoring interrogations that risked leaving prisoners in need of treatment;
* checking prisoners to certify that they were capable of surviving additional abuse;
* conditioning medical or mental health treatment on cooperation with interrogation;
* sharing confidential patient information that was used to harm patients;
* covering up evidence of torture and abuse; and
* turning a blind eye to cruel treatment.

To date, no state licensing boards or professional associations have investigated – or recognized, in some cases – abusive conduct by individual members of their professions.  In 2009, after years of denial, the [[American Psychological Association]] finally recognized that psychologists had engaged in torture.  However, the American Psychological Association has not recognized that psychologists were involved in the Bush Administration’s torture policy.  Some criticize the [[American Psychological Association|APA]] for failing to respond to allegations of “collusion between APA officials and the national security apparatus in providing ethical cover for psychologists’ participation in detainee abuse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychoanalystsopposewar.org/blog/2009/06/29/open-letter-in-response-to-the-american-psychological-association-board/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704035404/http://psychoanalystsopposewar.org/blog/2009/06/29/open-letter-in-response-to-the-american-psychological-association-board/ |archivedate=2009-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[American Medical Association]] has made clear that physicians should not be involved in interrogations of any kind, it continues to insist that it has “no specific knowledge of doctors being involved in abuse or torture,” despite evidence to the contrary, including government documents and [[Office of Legal Counsel]] memos, a report by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and multiple accounts by survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armed-services.senate.gov/Publications/Detainee%20Report%20Final_April%2022%202009.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429200942/http://armed-services.senate.gov/Publications/Detainee%20Report%20Final_April%2022%202009.pdf |archivedate=2009-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/olc_memos.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other accounts of medical or professional complicity in torture include:
*The SERE ("[[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape]]") program's chief psychologist, Col. Morgan Banks, issued guidance in early 2003 for the "behavioral science consultants" who helped to devise [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guantánamo]]'s interrogation strategy although he has emphatically denied that he had advocated the use of SERE counter-resistance techniques to break down detainees. The ''New Yorker'' notes that in November, 2001 Banks was detailed to Afghanistan, where he spent four months at [[Bagram Air Base]], "supporting combat operations against Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters".
*Confidential medical records of [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guantánamo]] prisoners were used to identify physical and psychological weaknesses that could be exploited during abusive interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hickman |first=John |year=2013 |title=Selling Guantánamo |location=Gainesville |publisher=University Press of Florida |pages=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2005 report by [[Human Rights Watch]] suggested that torture was routine under the appointed Iraqi government.&lt;ref&gt;http://hrw.org/reports/2005/iraq0105/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dr. [[J.C. Carothers]], British colonial Kenyan psychiatrist, has been implicated by some recent academic historians in designing interrogation of [[Mau Mau]] prisoners.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} His advice was published by the Kenya Government as The Psychology of Mau Mau, in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of Carothers involvement with [[Mau Mau]] in Kenya in the 1950s: {{cite book |last=McCulloch |first=Jock |year=1995 |title=Colonial Psychiatry and "the African Mind" |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FToFMwnBacQC&amp;pg=PA64 64–74]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Similarly, it has been implied that Interim [[Iraq]]i Prime Minister Dr. [[Ayad Allawi]] violated his obligation to medical ethics whilst serving as Western European chief of [[secret police]] for the [[Ba'ath Party|Baath]]ist government of [[Saddam Hussein]]. However, the same sources allege that Allawi had abandoned his medical education at that point and his medical degree "was conferred upon him by the Baath party."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?040628fa_fact&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the '''[[merger]] doctrine''' (a.k.a. "doctrine of merger") was the notion that marriage caused a woman's [[legal]] identity to merge with that of her husband.  

Thus, a woman could not [[lawsuit|sue]] or [[testify]] against her husband any more than he could sue or testify against himself. Since her identity had merged with his, the two were now considered one legal entity.

A '''mesophile''' is an [[organism]] that grows best in moderate [[temperature]], neither too hot nor too cold, typically between {{convert|20|and|45|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;Willey, Joanne M., Linda Sherwood, Christopher J. Woolverton, and Lansing M. Prescott. Prescott, Harley, and Klein's Microbiology. New York: McGraw-Hill Higher Education, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is mainly applied to [[microorganism]]s.  Organisms that prefer extreme environments are known as [[extremophiles]]. Mesophiles have diverse classifications, belonging to two [[domain (biology)|domain]]s: [[Bacteria]], [[Archaea]], and to [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] [[Fungi]] of domain [[Eukaryote|Eucarya]].  Mesophiles belonging to the domain Bacteria can either be [[gram-positive]] or [[gram-negative]]. Gram-positive bacteria have a cell layer made of [[peptidoglycan]] and stains purple. Gram-negative bacteria also contains peptidoglycan, yet the layer is extremely thin and stains red or pink. Oxygen requirements for mesophiles are not just confined to [[aerobic organism|aerobic]] or [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]]. There are three basic shapes of mesophiles: [[coccus]], [[bacillus]], and [[spiral]].

==Habitat==
The habitats of mesophiles can include [[cheese]] and [[yogurt]]. They are often included during fermentation of [[beer]] and [[wine]] making.  Since normal human body temperature is 37 [[celsius|°C]], the majority of human [[pathogens]] are mesophiles, as are most of the organisms comprising the [[human microbiome]].

== Vs. extremophiles==
Mesophiles are the opposite of [[extremophile]]s. Extremophiles that prefer cold environments are termed  [[psychrophile|psychrophilic]], those preferring warmer temperatures are termed [[Thermophile|thermophilic or thermotropic]] and those thriving in extremely hot environments are [[hyperthermophile|hyperthermophilic]].
A genome-wide computational approach has been designed by Zheng, et al. to classify bacteria into mesophilic and thermophilic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hao Zheng|author2=Hongwei Wu|title=Gene-centric association analysis for the correlation between the guanine-cytosine content levels and temperature range conditions of prokaryotic species|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|year=2010|volume=11|issue=Suppl 11|pages=S7|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-11-S11-S7|pmc=3024870|pmid=21172057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
All bacteria have their own optimum environmental surroundings and temperatures in which they thrive. Many factors are responsible for a given organism's optimal temperature range, but evidence suggests that the expression of particular genetic elements ([[alleles]]) can alter the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the organism. A recently published study demonstrated that mesophilic bacteria could be genetically engineered to express certain alleles from psychrophilic bacteria, consequently shifting the restrictive temperature range of the mesophilic bacteria to closely match that of the psychrophilic bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pankowski|first1=Jarosław A.|last2=Puckett|first2=Stephanie M.|last3=Nano|first3=Francis E.|title=Temperature Sensitivity Conferred by ligA Alleles from Psychrophilic Bacteria upon Substitution in Mesophilic Bacteria and a Yeast Species|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|date=15 March 2016|volume=82|issue=6|pages=1924–1932|doi=10.1128/AEM.03890-15|url=http://aem.asm.org/content/82/6/1924.short|issn=0099-2240|pmid=26773080|pmc=4784036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the less stable structure of mesophiles, it has reduced flexibility for [[protein synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Vijayabaskar, Mahalingam S. et al. "Construction of Energy Based Protein Structure Networks: Application in the Comparative Analysis of Thermophiles and Mesophiles" Biophysical Journal, Volume 98 , Issue 3 , 387a&lt;/ref&gt; Mesophiles are not able to synthesize proteins in low temperatures. It is more sensitive to temperature changes, and the [[fatty acid]] composition of the [[membrane]] does not allow for much [[Membrane fluidity|fluidity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = K.Y. | last2 = Torres | first2 = J. A. | year = 1993 | title = EFFECTS of TEMPERATURE and SOLUTE ON the MINIMUM WATER ACTIVITY FOR GROWTH and TEMPERATURE CHARACTERISTIC of SELECTED MESOPHILES and PSYCHROTROPHS | url = | journal = Journal of Food Processing and Preservation | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 305–318 | doi = 10.1111/j.1745-4549.1993.tb00733.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Decreasing the optimal temperature of 37&amp;nbsp;°C to 0&amp;nbsp;°C to 8&amp;nbsp;°C leads to a gradual decrease in protein synthesis. [[Cold-induced proteins]] (CIPs) are induced during low temperatures, which then allows [[Cold-shock domain|cold-shock proteins]] (CSPs) to synthesize. The shift back to the optimal temperature sees an increase, indicating that mesophiles are highly dependent on temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Perrot, F., Hébraud, M., Junter, G.-A. and Jouenne, T. "Protein synthesis in Escherichia coli at 4°C. Electrophoresis." 2000, 21: 1625–1629. doi:10.1002/(SICI)1522-2683(20000501)21:8&lt;1625::AID-ELPS1625&gt;3.0.CO;2-4&lt;/ref&gt; Oxygen availability also affects microorganism growth.&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, N. A. ; Stokes, J. L. " ROLE OF OXYGEN IN THE HIGH CELL YIELDS OF PSYCHROPHILES AND MESOPHILES AT LOW TEMPERATURES." The Journal of Bacteriology, 1963, Vol. 85(1), p.164 [Peer Reviewed Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two explanations for thermophiles being able to survive at such high temperatures whereas mesophiles can not. The most evident explanation is that thermophiles are believed to have cell components that are relatively more stable than the cell components of mesophiles which is why thermophiles are able to live at higher temperatures than mesophiles.&lt;ref name="Koffler 227–240"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koffler|first=Henry|date=2016-11-28|title=PROTOPLASMIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MESOPHILES AND THERMOPHILES1|journal=Bacteriological Reviews|volume=21|issue=4|pages=227–240|issn=0005-3678|pmc=180904|pmid=13488883}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A second school of thought, as represented by the writings of Gaughran (21) and Allen (3), believes that rapid resynthesis of damaged or destroyed cell constituents is the key to the problem of biological stability to heat."&lt;ref name="Koffler 227–240"/&gt;

==Oxygen requirements==
Due to the diversity of mesophiles, oxygen requirements greatly vary. [[Aerobic respiration]] requires the use of [[oxygen]] and anaerobic does not. There are three types of [[anaerobes]]. [[Facultative anaerobes]] grow in the absence of oxygen, using [[fermentation]] instead. During fermentation, sugars are converted to [[acids]], [[alcohol]], or [[gasses]]. If there is oxygen present, it will use aerobic respiration instead. [[Obligate anaerobe]]s cannot grow in the presence of oxygen. [[Aerotolerant anaerobe]]s can withstand oxygen.

==Roles==
Microorganisms play an important role in [[decomposition]] of organic matter and [[mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] of [[nutrients]]. In [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] environments, the diversity of the [[ecosystem]] allows for the diversity of mesophiles. The functions of each mesophile rely on the surroundings, most importantly temperature range.&lt;ref&gt;Ferroni, G.D., Kaminski, J.S. "Psychrophiles, psychrotrophs, and mesophiles in an environment which experiences seasonal temperature fluctuations." Canadian Journal of Microbiology, 1980, 26:1184-1191, 10.1139/m80-198&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bacteria]] such as mesophiles and [[thermophile]]s are used in the [[cheesemaking]] due to their role in [[fermentation]]. "Traditional [[microbiologist]]s use the following terms to indicate the general (slightly arbitrary) optimum temperature for the growth of bacteria: [[psychrophile]]s (15–20 °C), [[mesophiles]] (30–37 °C), thermophiles (50–60 °C) and extreme thermophiles (up to 122 °C)".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Mark. "Mesophilic and Thermophilic Cultures Used in Traditional Cheesemaking." Cheese and Microbes. Washington: ASM Publishing. 2014. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Both mesophiles and thermophiles are used in cheesemaking for the same reason; however, they grow, thrive and die at different temperatures. [[Psychrotrophic bacteria|Psychrotrophic]] bacteria contribute to dairy products spoiling, getting mouldy or going bad due to their ability to grow at lower temperatures such as in a refrigerator.

==Examples==
Some notable mesophiles include ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'', ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', and ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. Other examples of [[species]] of mesophiles are ''[[Clostridium kluyveri]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas maltophilia]]'', ''[[Thiobacillus novellus]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'', and ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]''. Different types of diseases and infections typically have pathogens from mesophilic bacteria such as the ones listed above.

===''Listeria monocytogenes''===
''Listeria monocytogenes'' is a gram-positive bacterium. It is closely related to ''Bacillus'' and ''Staphylococcus''. It is a rod-shaped, facultative anaerobe that is motile by peritrichous [[flagella]]. ''L. monocytogenes'' motility is limited from 20&amp;nbsp;°C to 25&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=LISTERIA/&gt; At the optimal temperature, it loses its motility. This bacterium is responsible for [[listeriosis]] which derives from contaminated food.&lt;ref name=LISTERIA&gt;Magalhã£Es, R. (2014). Listeria monocytogenes. 450-461.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Staphylococcus aureus''===
''Staphylococcus aureus'' was first identified in 1880.&lt;ref name=AUREUS/&gt; It is responsible for different infections stemming from an injury. The bacterium overcomes the body's natural mechanisms. Long lasting infections of ''S. aureus'' includes [[pneumonia]], [[meningitis]], and [[osteomyelitis]]. ''S. aureus'' is commonly contracted in hospital settings.&lt;ref name=AUREUS&gt;Todd, E. (2014). Staphylococcus Aureus. 530-534&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Escherichia coli''===
''Escherichia coli'' is a gram-negative, rod-shaped facultative anaerobic bacterium that does not produce [[spores]].&lt;ref name=COLI/&gt; The bacterium is a member of [[Enterobacteriaceae]]. It is capable of producing [[enterotoxins]] which are [[thermolabile]] or [[thermostable]].&lt;ref name=COLI&gt;Robinson, Richard K.. (2000). Encyclopedia of Food Microbiology, Volumes 1-3 - Escherichia Coli. Elsevier. Online version available at: http://app.knovel.com/hotlink/pdf/id:kt0051LGG3/encyclopedia-food-microbiology/escherichia-coli&lt;/ref&gt; Other characteristics of ''E. coli'' are that it is [[oxidase]]-negative, [[citrate]]-negative, [[methyl red|methyl-red]] positive, and [[Voges-Proskauer]]-negative. To sum up ''E. coli'', it is a [[coliform]]. It is able to use [[glucose]] and [[acetate]] as a carbon source for fermentation. ''E. coli'' is commonly found in the [[Digestive system|gut]] of living organisms.&lt;ref name=ROBINSON/&gt; ''E. coli'' has many capabilities such as being a [[host (biology)|host]] for [[recombinant DNA]] and being a pathogen.&lt;ref name=ROBINSON&gt;Robinson, Richard K..

'''Moha''' (Sanskrit, Pali; Tibetan phonetic: ''timuk'') is a [[Buddhist]] concept of character affliction or poison, and refers to "delusion, confusion, dullness".&lt;ref name=buswelllopezmoha&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E.

* One of the [[Mental_factors_(Buddhism)#Fourteen_unwholesome_mental_factors|fourteen unwholesome mental factors]] within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings

==Etymology and meaning==
''Moha'' appears in the Vedic literature, and has roots in early Vedic word ''mogha'' which means "empty, unreal, vain, useless, foolish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids |author2=William Stede |title=Pali-English Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC&amp;pg=PA543 |year=1921|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1144-7|page= 542}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term, as well as the three defects concept appears in the ancient texts of Jainism and some schools of Hinduism such as [[Nyaya]], in their respective discussion of the theory of rebirths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nathmal Tatia|title=Studies in Jaina Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DZ7IwbORbLgC&amp;pg=PA101|year=1965|publisher=Jain Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-89581-996-3|pages=101–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term means "delusion, confusion, dullness".&lt;ref name=buswelllopezmoha/&gt; The opposite of ''Moha'' is ''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|Prajna]]'' (insight, wisdom). Beliefs different from those considered as insights in Buddhism, are forms of delusions or Moha in Buddhism. Moha is one of the roots of evil, in the Buddhist belief.&lt;ref name=davidloyp28/&gt;

==Application==

Within the Mahayana tradition, ''moha'' is classified as one of the [[three poisons]], which are considered to be the root cause of suffering.

In the Mahayana tradition, ''moha'' is considered to be a subcategory of ''[[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidyā]]''. Whereas ''avidyā'' is defined as a fundamental ignorance, ''moha'' is defined as an ignorance of cause and effect or of reality that accompanies only destructive states of mind or behavior.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;Berzin, Alexander. [http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/about/glossary/glossary.html_80737386.html ''Berzin Archives, Glossary of Buddhist Terms'']&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Moha'' is sometimes replaced by ''avidyā'' in lists of the [[Three poisons (Buddhism)|three poisons]]. In contemporary explanations of the ''three poisons'', teachers are likely to emphasize the fundamental ignorance of ''avidyā'' rather than ''moha''.

{{SikhBeliefs}}
In [[Sikhism]], '''''Nām Japō''''' ([[Gurmukhi]] ਨਾਮ ਜਪੋ), ''Naam Japna'', or ''Naam Simran'' refers to the [[meditation]], vocal singing of [[hymn]]s from the Sri [[Guru Granth Sahib]] or contemplating the various [[Names of God#Sikhism|Names of God]] (or qualities of God), especially the chanting of the word ''[[Waheguru]]'', which means "Wonderful Lord" representing the formless being, the creator of all the forms and the being omnipresent in all forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mosher|first=Lucinda|title=Faith in the neighborhood: Praying: The Rituals of Faith|year=2005|publisher=Church Publishing, Inc.|isbn=9781596271555}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singing of hymns generally is also referred to as ''Nām Jap'', sometimes also called ''Nām [[Simran (Sanskrit word)|Simran]]''. Singing of hymns with musical accompaniment is generally referred to as ''[[Kirtan]]''. While contemplating God's names a devotee is able to get [[Nām Japō|nām]], the divine connection with God. Nām is able to fulfill all desires and cleanse the mind of its impurities distress. Through Nām the devotees are able to harness Godly qualities and remove [[Five Thieves|the five thieves]].

''Nām Japna'' requires the remembrance of God or the [[Akal|Akal Purkh]], the supreme formless power that is timeless and deathless,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Abstracts of Sikh Studies, Volume 6|year=2004|publisher=Institute of Sikh Studies|location=the University of Michigan|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; by repeating and focusing the mind on God's various names or qualities. Some of the names of Gods can be found in the [[Mul Mantar]], which is repeated throughout the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], and also found in [[Guru Gobind Singh]]'s [[Jaap Sahib]], which contains 950 names of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Prithi Pal|title=The History of Sikh Gurus|year=2006|publisher=Lotus Press|isbn=9788183820752|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guideline in the ''[[Sikh Rehat Maryada|Rehat Maryada]]'' of [[Guru Gobind Singh]] demands that the [[Sikh]] engage in ''Naam Simran'' as part of his or her daily routine.

''Nām Japō'' is one of the [[Three pillars of Sikhism]], along with ''[[Kirat karō]]'' and ''[[Vaṇḍ chakkō]]''. Critical importance is given to the meditation in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] as the way in which humans can conquer ego, greed, attachment, anger and lust, together commonly called the [[Five Evils]] or Five Thieves and to bring peace and tranquility into one's mind. The Sikhs practice both the quiet individual recitation of ''Naam'' in one's mind, commonly called ''Naam Simran'', and the loud and communal recitation of ''Naam'', called ''Naam Jaap''. However, this is not a strict definition of these phrases.

Guru Ji says in the Guru Granth Sahib:
{{Quote|With my hands I do God's work; with my tongue I sing God's Glorious Praises.&lt;br&gt;
With my feet, I walk on the Path of my Lord and Master. ((1)) &lt;br&gt;
It is a good time, when I remember Him in meditation. &lt;br&gt;
Meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, I cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ((1)(Pause)) &lt;br&gt;
With your eyes, behold the Blessed Vision of the Saints. &lt;br&gt;
Record the Immortal Lord God within your mind. ((2)) &lt;br&gt;
Listen to the Kirtan of God's Praises, at the Feet of the Holy. &lt;br&gt;
Your fears of birth and death shall depart. ((3))&lt;br&gt;
Enshrine the Lotus Feet of your Lord and Master within your heart. &lt;br&gt;
Thus this human life, so difficult to obtain, shall be redeemed. ((4)(51)(120))|Guru Granth Sahib, page 189&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=189&amp;english=t&amp;id=8044 Srigranth.org (text in red)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''obsolete units of measurement''' of German-speaking countries consist of a variety of units, with varying local standard definitions. Some of these units are still used in everyday speech and even in stores and on street markets as shorthand for similar amounts in the metric system. For example, some customers ask for one pound (''ein Pfund'') of something when they want 500&amp;nbsp;grams.

The [[metric system]] became compulsory on 1 January 1872, in [[Germany]] and on 1 January 1876, in Austria.&lt;ref name="Barnard1879"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnard|first=Frederick Augustus Porter|authorlink=Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard|title=The Metric system of weights and measures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pobxN16e3fgC&amp;pg=PA220|accessdate=27 February 2012|year=1879|publisher=American Metric Bureau|pages=220–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some obsolete German units have names similar to units that were traditionally used in other countries, and that are still used in the United Kingdom ([[imperial units]]) and the United States ([[United States customary units]]).

==German system==

Before the introduction of the metric system in German, almost every town had its own definitions of the units shown below.  Often towns posted local definitions on a wall of the city hall.  For example, the front wall of the old city hall of Rudolstädt (still standing) has two marks which show the "Rudolstädter Elle", the proper length of the Elle in that city.  Supposedly by 1810 there were 112 different standards for the Elle around Germany. {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Length==

===''Meile'' (mile)===

A German geographic mile (''geographische Meile'') is defined as {{frac|1|15}} equatorial degrees, equal to {{convert|7420.54|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=on}}. A common German mile, land mile, or post mile (''Gemeine deutsche Meile'', ''Landmeile'',  ''Postmeile'') was defined in various ways at different places and different times. After the introduction of the metric system in the 19th century, the ''Landmeile'' was generally fixed at {{convert|7500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} (the ''Reichsmeile''), but before then there were many local and regional variants (of which some are shown below):

===''Nösel''===
In general, the ''Nösel'' (also spelled ''Össel'') was a measure of liquid volume equal to half a ''Kanne'' ("[[jar]]," "[[jug (container)|jug]]," "[[bottle]]," "[[Tin can|can]]"). Volume often varied depending on whether it was beer or wine. Its subdivisions were the ''Halbnösel'' ("Half-Nösel") and the ''Viertelnösel'' ("Quarter-Nösel).  

Actual volumes so measured, however, varied from one [[States of Germany|state]] or even one city to another.  Within [[Saxony]],  for example, the "[[Dresden]] jar" held approximately {{convert|1|USqt|L impqt|lk=on|disp=or}}, so a nösel in Dresden was about {{convert|1|USpt|L imppt}}.  The full volume of a "[[Leipzig]] jar" measured {{convert|1.2|L|USqt impqt|sp=us}}; the Leipzig nösel was therefore {{convert|0.6|L|USqt impqt|sp=us}}.

:&lt;big&gt;{{frac|1|320}} Ahm = {{frac|1|64}} Eimer = {{frac|1|16}} Viertel = {{frac|1|8}} Stübchen = {{frac|1|4}} Kannen = {{frac|1|2}} Quartiers = 1 Nösel = 2 Halbnöseln = 4 Viertelnöseln&lt;/big&gt;

The nösel was used in minor commerce, as well as in the household to measure meal, grain, and such. These units of measure were officially valid in Saxony until 1868, when the [[metric system]] was introduced.  Nevertheless, the old measures have continued in private use for decades.

One interesting modification was introduced in [[Thuringia]].  There, the nösel was, by extension, also a measure of area; namely, the area of land which could be sown with one nösel of seed &amp;mdash; or about {{convert|19.36|sqyd|m2 acre}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15886">The '''one gene–one enzyme hypothesis''' is the idea that [[gene]]s act through the production of [[enzymes]], with each gene responsible for producing a single enzyme that in turn affects a single step in a [[metabolic pathway]].  The concept was proposed by [[George Beadle]] and [[Edward Tatum]] in an influential 1941 paper&lt;ref name="PNAS 1941"&gt;

==Origin==
[[File:File-AMNHBeadletatum.jpg|350px|thumb|right|Mention of [[George Beadle|Beadle]] and [[Edward Lawrie Tatum|Tatum's]] 1958 prize on the monument at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City]].]] 
Although some instances of [[Inborn error of metabolism|errors in metabolism]] following [[Mendelian inheritance]] patterns were known earlier, beginning with the 1902 identification by [[Archibald Garrod]] of [[alkaptonuria]] as a Mendelian [[recessive]] trait, for the most part genetics could not be applied to metabolism through the late 1930s.  Another of the exceptions was the work of [[Boris Ephrussi]] and George Beadle, two geneticists working on the eye color pigments of ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' fruit flies in the [[Caltech]] laboratory of [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]].  In the mid-1930s they found that genes affecting eye color appeared to be serially dependent, and that the normal red eyes of ''Drosophila'' were the result of pigments that went through a series of transformations; different eye color gene mutations disrupted the transformations at a different points in the series.  Thus, Beadle reasoned that each gene was responsible for an enzyme acting in the metabolic pathway of pigment synthesis.  However, because it was a relatively superficial pathway rather than one shared widely by diverse organisms, little was known about the biochemical details of fruit fly eye pigment metabolism.  Studying that pathway in more detail required isolating pigments from the eyes of flies, an extremely tedious process.&lt;ref&gt;Morange, pp. 21-24&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving to [[Stanford University]] in 1937, Beadle began working with biochemist [[Edward Tatum]] to isolate the fly eye pigments.  After some success with this approach&amp;mdash;they identified one of the intermediate pigments shortly after another researcher, [[Adolf Butenandt]], beat them to the discovery&amp;mdash;Beadle and Tatum switched their focus to an organism that made genetic studies of biochemical traits much easier: the bread mold ''[[Neurospora crassa]]'', which had recently been subjected to genetic research by one of Thomas Hunt Morgan's researchers, [[Carl C. Lingegren]].  ''Neurospora'' had several advantages: it required a simple [[growth medium]], it grew quickly, and because of the production of [[ascospore]]s during reproduction it was easy to isolate genetic mutants for analysis.  They produced mutations by exposing the fungus to [[X-ray]]s, and then identified strains that had metabolic defects by varying the growth medium. This work of Beadle and Tatum led almost at once to an important generalization.  This was that most mutants unable to grow on minimal medium but able to grow on “complete” medium each require addition of only one particular supplement for growth on minimal medium.  If the synthesis of a particular nutrient (such as an [[amino acid]] or [[vitamin]]) was disrupted by mutation, that mutant strain could be grown by adding the necessary nutrient to the medium.  This finding suggested that most mutations affected only a single metabolic pathway.  Further evidence obtained soon after the initial findings tended to show that generally only a single step in the pathway is blocked.  Following their first report of three such ''[[auxotroph]]'' mutants in 1941, Beadle and Tatum used this method to create series of related mutants and determined the order in which amino acids and some other [[metabolites]] were synthesized in several metabolic pathways.&lt;ref&gt;Fruton, pp. 432-434&lt;/ref&gt;  The obvious inference from these experiments was that each gene mutation affects the activity of a single enzyme.  This led directly to the one gene–one enzyme hypothesis, which, with certain qualifications and refinements, has remained essentially valid to the present day.  As recalled by Horowitz et al.,&lt;ref name=Horowitz&gt;{{cite journal |author=Horowitz NH |title=The sixtieth anniversary of biochemical genetics |journal=Genetics |volume=143 |issue=1 |pages=1–4 |date=May 1996 |pmid=8722756 |pmc=1207243 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the work of Beadle and Tatum also demonstrated that genes have an essential role in biosyntheses.  At the time of the experiments (1941), non-geneticists still generally believed that genes governed only trivial biological traits, such as eye color, and bristle arrangement in fruit flies, while basic biochemistry was determined in the cytoplasm by unknown processes.  Also, many respected geneticists thought that gene action was far too complicated to be resolved by any simple experiment.  Thus Beadle and Tatum brought about a fundamental revolution in our understanding of genetics.

The nutritional mutants of ''Neurospora'' also proved to have practical applications; in one of the early, if indirect, examples of [[military funding of science]] in the biological sciences, Beadle garnered additional research funding (from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and an association of manufacturers of military rations) to develop strains that could be used to [[assay]] the nutrient content of foodstuffs, to ensure adequate nutrition for troops in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Kay, pp. 204-205.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The hypothesis and alternative interpretations==
In their first ''Neurospora'' paper, published in the November 15, 1941, edition of the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'', Beadle and Tatum noted that it was "entirely tenable to suppose that these genes which are themselves a part of the system, control or regulate specific reactions in the system either by acting directly as enzymes or by determining the specificities of enzymes", an idea that had been suggested, though with limited experimental support, as early as 1917; they offered new evidence to support that view, and outlined a research program that would enable it to be explored more fully.&lt;ref name="PNAS 1941"/&gt;  By 1945, Beadle, Tatum and others, working with ''Neurospora'' and other model organisms such as ''[[E. coli]]'', had produced considerable experimental evidence that each step in a metabolic pathway is controlled by a single gene.  In a 1945 review, Beadle suggested that "the gene can be visualized as directing the final configuration of a protein molecule and thus determining its specificity."  He also argued that "for reasons of economy in the evolutionary process, one might expect that with few exceptions  the final specificity of a particular enzyme would be imposed by only one gene."  At the time, genes were widely thought to consist of [[proteins]] or [[nucleoproteins]] (although the [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment]] and related work was beginning to cast doubt on that idea).  However, the proposed connection between a single gene and a single protein enzyme outlived the protein theory of gene structure.  In a 1948 paper, Norman Horowitz named the concept the "one gene–one enzyme hypothesis".&lt;ref name="Fruton, p. 434"/&gt;

Although influential, the one gene–one enzyme hypothesis was not unchallenged.  Among others, [[Max Delbrück]] was skeptical only a single enzyme was actually involved at each step along metabolic pathways.  For many who did accept the results, it strengthened the link between genes and enzymes, so that some biochemists thought that genes ''were'' enzymes; this was consistent with other work, such as studies of the reproduction of [[tobacco mosaic virus]] (which was known to have heritable variations and which followed the same pattern of [[autocatalysis]] as many enzymatic reactions) and the crystallization of that virus as an apparently pure protein.  At the start of the 1950s, the Neurospora findings were widely admired, but the prevailing view in 1951 was that the conclusion Beadle had drawn from them was a vast oversimplification.&lt;ref name=Horowitz /&gt;  Beadle wrote in 1966, that after reading the 1951 Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Genes and Mutations, he had the impression that supporters of the one gene–one enzyme hypothesis “could be counted on the fingers of one hand with a couple of fingers left over.”&lt;ref&gt;Beadle, G. W. (1966) "Biochemical genetics: some recollections", pp. 23-32 in ''Phage and the Origins of Molecular Biology'', edited by J. Cairns, G. S. Stent and J. D. Watson.  Cold Spring Harbor Symposia, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory of Quantitative Biiology, NY. ASIN: B005F08IQ8&lt;/ref&gt;  By the early 1950s, most biochemists and geneticists considered [[DNA]] the most likely candidate for physical basis of the gene, and the one gene–one enzyme hypothesis was reinterpreted accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;Morange, pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

===One gene–one polypeptide===
In attributing an instructional role to genes, Beadle and Tatum implicitly accorded genes an informational capability.  This insight provided the foundation for the concept of a genetic code.  However, it was not until the experiments were performed showing that DNA was the genetic material, that proteins consist of a defined linear sequence of amino acids, and that DNA structure contained a linear sequence of base pairs, was there a clear basis for solving the genetic code.

By the early 1950s, advances in biochemical genetics&amp;mdash;spurred in part by the original hypothesis&amp;mdash;made the one gene–one enzyme hypothesis seem very unlikely (at least in its original form).  Beginning in 1957, [[Vernon Ingram]] and others showed through [[electrophoresis]] and [[Paper chromatography|2D chromatography]] that genetic variations in proteins (such as [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle cell hemoglobin]]) could be limited to differences in just a single polypeptide chain in a [[multimeric protein]], leading to a "one gene–one polypeptide" hypothesis instead.&lt;ref&gt;Berg P, Singer M.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=XsyJXxHaDPQC&amp;pg=PA307&amp;lpg=PA307&amp;dq=history+%22one+gene+one+polypeptide%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gJVxP_VyO7&amp;sig=3WLBBdCrXQUT7Bmmb7LbeT9nX2Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=N3LrSp6yLIXcNt6-wYMM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20%22one%20gene%20one%20polypeptide%22&amp;f=false George Beadle, an uncommon farmer: the emergence of genetics in the 20th century], CSHL Press, 2003.  {{ISBN|0-87969-688-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87969-688-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to geneticist [[Rowland H. Davis]], "By 1958 – indeed, even by 1948 – one gene, one enzyme was no longer a hypothesis to be resolutely defended; it was simply the name of a research program."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, the one gene–one polypeptide perspective cannot account for the various spliced versions in many eukaryote organisms which use a [[spliceosome]] to individually prepare a RNA transcript depending on the various inter- and intra-cellular environmental signals.  This splicing was discovered in 1977 by [[Phillip Sharp]] and [[Richard J. Roberts]]&lt;ref&gt;Chow, Louise T., Richard E. Gelinas, Thomas R. Broker, and Richard J. Roberts. "An amazing sequence arrangement at the 5' ends of adenovirus 2 messenger RNA." ''Cell'' 12, no. 1 (September 1977): 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible anticipation of Beadle and Tatum's results==

Historian [[Jan Sapp]] has studied the controversy in regard to German geneticist [[Franz Moewus]]  who, as some leading geneticists of the 1940s and 50s argued, generated similar results before Beadle and Tatum's celebrated 1941 work.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Sapp (1990), Where the Truth Lies: Franz Moewus and the Origins of Molecular biology, New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Working on the algae ''[[Chlamydomonas]]'', Moewus published, in the 1930s, results that showed that different genes were responsible for different enzymatic reactions in the production of hormones that controlled the organism's reproduction.  However, as Sapp skillfully details, those results were challenged by others who found the data 'too good to be true' statistically, and the results could not be replicated.

'''Pahawh Hmong''' (&lt;small&gt;[[Romanized Popular Alphabet|RPA]]&lt;/small&gt;: ''Phajhauj Hmoob'' {{IPA-hmn|pʰâ hâu m̥ɔ́ŋ|}}, known also as ''Ntawv Pahawh, Ntawv Keeb, Ntawv Caub Fab, Ntawv Soob Lwj)'' is an indigenous [[Semi-syllabary|semi-syllabic]] [[writing system|script]], invented in 1959 by [[Shong Lue Yang]], to write two [[Hmong language]]s, Hmong Daw ''(Hmoob Dawb'' White Miao) and Hmong Njua &lt;small&gt;AKA&lt;/small&gt; Hmong Leng ''(Moob Leeg'' Green Miao).

==Form==
Pahawh is written left to right. Each syllable is written with two letters, an [[syllable onset|onset]] ''(la,'' an initial consonant or [[consonant cluster]]) and a [[syllable rime|rime]] ''(yu,'' a vowel, [[diphthong]], or vowel plus [[syllable coda|final consonant]]).&lt;ref&gt;The only final consonant is {{IPA|[ŋ]}}. However, this is sometimes analyzed as vowel nasalization: ''oo, ee, aa'' {{IPA|/ɔŋ, ɛŋ, aŋ/}} or {{IPA|/ɔ̃, ɛ̃, ã/}}. Thus Pahawh can be considered an alphabet where both consonants and vowels may be complex, much like ''x'' {{IPA|[ks]}} and ''i'' {{IPA|[aɪ]}} in English.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the order of these elements is rime-initial, the opposite of their spoken order. (That is, each syllable would seem to be written right to left, if it were transcribed literally into the Roman alphabet.) This is an indication that Shong conceived of the rimes as primary; Pahawh Hmong might therefore be thought of as a vowel-centered [[abugida]]. Tones and many onsets are distinguished by [[diacritic]]s.

The onset ''k'' is not written, so that a rime letter (V) written by itself is read as ''kV.'' Nor is the rime ''au'' (on mid tone) written, so that an onset letter (C) written by itself is read ''Cau,'' except following a bare rime, as otherwise these could be read as a single syllable. The ''absence'' of an onset, however, is indicated with a [[zero consonant|null-onset letter]]. Again, this is similar to an abugida, but with the roles of consonant and vowel reversed.&lt;ref&gt;Coincidentally, RPA also has an inherent consonant which is not written, [[glottal stop]], along with a null-consonant diacritic, the apostrophe: ''ai'' {{IPA|/ʔāi/}}, ''’ai'' {{IPA|/āi/}}. Few Hmong words are vowel initial, so writing  the absence of a consonant with an apostrophe is more economical than writing glottal stop with an apostrophe.&lt;/ref&gt;

For an example of the positional variation, consider the phrase (in RPA orthography) ''kuv rau tshais rau koj noj'' "I serve you breakfast". Since the first word, ''kuv,'' starts with a ''k,'' it is written as the bare rime ''uv'' in Pahawh. The word ''rau,'' with mid-tone ''au'' as the rime, is normally written as a bare onset ''r,'' and indeed this is the case for the second instance in this sentence. However, since the first ''rau'' follows a bare rime, it cannot be written as a bare onset ''r,'' or the combination might be read as ''ruv'' rather than ''kuv rau.'' Therefore, the combination ''kuv rau'' is written ''uv rau'' rather than ''uv r,'' with the rime ''au'' made explicit (Smalley ''et al.'' 1990:58).

[[Image:Pahawh la glossed.png|right|thumb|Pahawh onsets. Except for the null onset series at lower right, these are consistent for stages 2–4. Row 3 reads ''l-, dl-, dlh-'' in Hmong Njua.]]
[[Image:Pahawh yu glossed.png|left|thumb|Pahawh rimes, stage 2. The tone diacritics are irregular.  Note that ''-v'' tone is sometimes written with the left-hand rime glyph, sometimes with the right. In stage 3, it is consistently written with the right-hand glyph, and all tones have the diacritics of ''koo'' above: [left glyph] ''-b'' none, ''-m'' dot, ''-j'' [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]; [right glyph] ''-v'' none, ''-'' dot, ''-s'' macron, ''-g'' [[trema (diacritic)|trema]]. When used, ''-d'' tone takes the left-hand glyphs with a stroke {{angle bracket|'}} diacritic. The ''ia'' and ''a'' rows may be read ''a'' and ''aa'' in Hmong Njua.]]
Pahawh has twenty onset letters to transcribe sixty phonemic onsets. This is accomplished with two diacritics, a dot and a tack, written above the onset. However, although there is some scattered similarity between the sounds of the resulting forms, there is no overall pattern to the system. For example, the letter for ''h'' with a dot is pronounced ''th,'' and with a tack is pronounced ''pl.'' The null consonant does not take diacritics in Hmong Daw, but does in Hmong Njua, for two onsets, ''ndl'' and ''ndlh,'' which only occur in Hmong Njua. (Similarly, Daw ''d'' and ''dh,'' which do not occur in Njua, are used for Njua ''dl'' and ''dlh,'' which do not occur in Daw.)

The rimes, in contrast, are over-specified. There are thirteen rime sounds, but twenty-six letters to represent them. One of each pair takes four of the eight [[tone (linguistics)|tones]], while the other takes the other four tones. Diacritics (none, dot, macron, and trema) distinguish the tones that each rime letter may carry. One of the tones, written ''-d'' in RPA, is not phonemic but is a [[prosodic unit]]-final [[allophone]] of the [[creaky voice|creaky]] [[register (phonology)|register]] ''-m.'' It may be written in Pahawh by changing the dot diacritic to a short stroke, but it is not used by many people.

Shong used the rimes with the values ''kiab'' and ''kab'' in Hmong Daw for ''kab'' and ''kaab'' ({{IPA|/káŋ/}}) in Hmong Njua. However, Cwjmem retains the Daw values for Njua and adds a pipe (|) to the left of ''kab'' etc. to write ''kaab'' etc.

In addition to phonetic elements, Pahawh Hmong has a minor [[logograph]]ic component, with characters for
*the numerals 0–10, {{e|2}} (hundreds), {{e|4}} (myriads), {{e|6}} (millions), {{e|8}}, {{e|10}}, and {{e|12}} (billions), though the higher numerals have been dropped leaving a positional decimal system
*[[arithmetic]]al signs
*periods of time: year, season, month, day, date
*the most common [[classifier (linguistics)|grammatical classifier]], ''lub,'' which when written out phonetically consists of two very similar letters, and
*eighteen [[clan]] signs. These were never disseminated, but were intended to clarify personal relationships in Hmong refugee camps, where people regularly met strangers of unknown clan. Strict taboos govern the behavior of Hmong men and women from the same clan.

Punctuation is derived from the Roman alphabet, presumably through French or Lao,&lt;ref&gt;Punctuation was introduced in 1969 when Chia Koua Vang, who was literate in RPA, wrote to Shong in prison asking him what to put at the ends of sentences. Neither Shong nor any of his other disciples were literate in any other script at this point, so presumably someone taught him punctuation there. (Smalley ''et al.'' 1990:76–77)&lt;/ref&gt; except for a sign introduced by one of Shong's disciples that replaced Shong's {{angle bracket|!}}, but also includes a native sign for [[reduplication]] and a native [[cantillation]] mark.

===Second and third stage tones===
There are two orthographic systems in use for Pahawh Hmong, the ''second reduced stage'' from 1965 and the ''third reduced stage'' from 1970 (see history, below). Some Hmong communities consider second stage to be more authentic, while others prefer third stage as more regular. It would appear that stage two is more widespread.

The differences are primarily in tone assignment. Bare rimes—that is, rime letters without a tone diacritic—have various values in stage two, but are regularly high tone ''(-b)'' or rising tone ''(-v)'' in stage three. Likewise, although the pedagogic charts are organized so that each column corresponds to a single tone, the tonic diacritics are scattered about the columns in stage two, but correspond to them in stage three. (Stage 4, which today is only used for shorthand, dispenses with the ''-v'' rime letters, replacing them with additional diacritics on the ''-b'' rime letters, so that each rime and tone has a single dedicated glyph.)

Tone transcription is that of the [[Romanized Popular Alphabet]].

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2011}}
[[Image:Pahawh Source rimes.png|thumb|right|Rimes of stage 1&lt;br&gt;(Hmong Daw values)]]
Pahawh Hmong was the product of a native messianic movement, based on the idea that, throughout history, God had given the Hmong power through the gift of writing, and revoked it as divine retribution.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In 1959 [[Shong Lue Yang]] (''Soob Lwj Yaj''), a Hmong spiritual leader from Laos, created Pahawh. Yang was not previously literate in any language.&lt;ref name="Fadiman291"&gt;[[Anne Fadiman|Fadiman, Anne]]. "Note on Hmong Orthography, Pronunciation, and Quotations." ''The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux. 1997. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; An illiterate peasant, Shong claimed to be the Son of God, messiah of the Hmong and [[Khmu people]], and that God had revealed Pahawh to him in 1959, in northern Vietnam near the border with Laos, to restore writing to the Hmong and Khmu people. Over the next twelve years he and his disciples taught it as part of a Hmong cultural revival movement, mostly in Laos after Shong had fled Communist Vietnam. The Khmuic version of the script never caught on, and has disappeared. Shong continually modified the Hmong script, producing four increasingly sophisticated versions, until he was assassinated by Laotian soldiers in 1971 to stop his growing influence as part of the opposition resistance. Knowledge of the later stages of Pahawh come to us through his disciple Chia Koua Vang, who corresponded with Shong in prison.
[[Image:Pahawh Source onsets.png|thumb|right|Onsets of stage 1&lt;br&gt;(Hmong Daw values)]]
*The first stage of Pahawh, Pahawh Pa ''(Pajhawj Paj),'' common called the '''source''' version, had distinct glyphs for all 60 onsets and 91 rimes of both Hmong Daw and Hmong Njua. Although there were diacritics, there was no relationship between them and the sound values of the letters, and many of the diacritics are unique to a single letter. Among the rimes, there was a strong tendency for letters which differed only in diacritic to share the same vowel and differ in tone. However, this was not absolute. For example, a letter shaped like Ü stood for the rime ''iaj,'' while &lt;u&gt;U&lt;/u&gt;, differing only in its diacritic, stood for the rime ''us.'' Plain U without a diacritic did not occur. Similarly, the letter that, without a diacritic, represents the rime ''ag,'' when combined with a diacritic dot represents the onset ''rh.'' Thus it can be seen that at this stage the diacritics were integral parts of their letters, with only the beginnings of an independent existence.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

:Stage 1 was abandoned after Shong revealed the second stage, with only the occasional glyph showing up when people who know it write using other versions. However, it is not considered obsolete, as people remember Shong's instructions to use this source of all later Pahawh as a sacred script.

*The second stage, Pahawh Njia Dua O ''(Pajhawj Ntsiab Duas Ob)'' "second stage reduced version", was the first practical Hmong script. It was taught by Shong in 1965 and is supported today by the Australian Language Institute and Cwjmem (Everson 1999). The consonants are graphically regular, in that each column in the pedagogic charts contains the same diacritic, but are phonetically irregular, in that the diacritics have no consistent meaning. (This situation remained in all later stages.) Tone assignment is irregular, in that the diacritics do not represent specific tones with the rimes any more than they represent specific features with the consonants. For example, the trema sometimes represents the ''-b'' tone, sometimes ''-j, -v,'' or ''-g,'' depending on which rime it is added to. The one exception is the ''-d'' "tone", which is actually a [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] inflection of the ''-m'' tone. Shong added a specific diacritic for this when Chia, who was familiar with RPA, asked him how RPA ''-d'' should be written, but it was treated as extraneous to the tone system, was not included in the rime charts, and was not always taught to Shong's disciples.
*The third stage, Pahawh Njia Dua Pe ''(Pajhawj Ntsiab Duas Peb)'' "third stage reduced version", introduced in 1970, regularized tone assignment, which was irregular in the second stage. It restores the null onset, which with the addition of diacritics covers Hmong Njua consonants not found in Hmong Daw, that had been found in stage 1, but does not otherwise change the onsets. Chia believes the lack of this series in stage two was merely an oversight on his part in his prison correspondence with Shong (Smalley ''et al.'' 1990:70). It was not distributed as widely in Laos as the second stage, due to fear of admitting knowledge of the script after the Communist takeover. Both second and third stage are currently in use in different Hmong communities; however, because the third stage did not appear widely until after Shong's death, there is a suspicion in many communities that it and the fourth stage were invented by Shong's disciples, and therefore are not authentic Pahawh. In the third stage, there is also presence of different signs for month, tens, and zero.
*The final version, Pahawh Tsa ''(Pajhawj Txha)'' "core version", published in 1971 just a month before Shong's death, was a radical simplification with one letter per rime and one diacritic per tone. The onsets were not changed. The only graphic addition was that of three new tone marks, for seven total, but half of the rimes were eliminated: The ''-b, -m, -d, -j'' tones are written as in stage 3; the ''-v, -, -s, -g'' tones now use the same rime letters as the other tones but with different diacritics: [[circumflex]], underlined dot, underlined stroke, and [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]]. (The diaeresis is retained from stage 3, so only the rime letter changes for this tone.) Stage 4 is not widely known, but is used as a kind of [[shorthand]] by some who do know it; indeed, it may be called "Hmong shorthand" in English.

Pahawh is not as widespread as RPA romanization for writing Hmong, partially because of the difficulties in typesetting it, but it is a source of great pride for many Hmong who do not use it, as in Southeast Asia every respectable language has a script of its own, which RPA does not provide.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} However, for some educated Hmong, Pahawh is considered an embarrassing remnant of a superstitious past (Smalley ''et al.'' 1990:165).

==Origin==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}
Because Shong was illiterate, it is sometimes assumed that he invented Pahawh ''ex nihilo.'' However, Shong was acutely aware of writing and of the advantages that it provided; indeed, that was the basis of his messianic movement. It would appear that existing scripts provided his inspiration, even if he did not fully understand them, much as the Roman alphabet inspired the illiterate [[Sequoyah]] when he invented the [[Cherokee syllabary|Cherokee script]], in a process called [[trans-cultural diffusion]]. Not only do the forms of the majority of the letters in the oldest stage of Pahawh closely resemble the letters of the local [[Lao script|Lao alphabet]] and missionary scripts such as [[Pollard script|Pollard]] and [[Fraser alphabet|Fraser]], though they are independent in sound value (much like the relationship between Roman and Cherokee), but the appearance of vowel and tone diacritics in those scripts, which would appear nearly random to the illiterate, may explain the idiosyncratic use of diacritics in early Pahawh. Nevertheless, even if the graphic forms of Pahawh letters derive from other scripts, much of the typology of the script, with its primary rimes and secondary onsets, would appear to be Shong's invention.

The later stages of Pahawh became typologically more like Lao and the Roman alphabet, suggesting that perhaps they influenced its evolution. However, even from the start, Pahawh is "fascinatingly similar [...] and fascinatingly different" from the Lao alphabet (Smalley ''et al.'' 1990:90). For example, it resembles an [[abugida]] such as Lao where the order of writing does not reflect the order of speech, but with the roles of consonant and vowel reversed. There is an inherent vowel, as in Lao, though only on one tone, but also an inherent consonant. In Lao, tone depends on the consonant; it is modified with diacritics, but the patterns of modification are complex. In early Pahawh, tone depends on the rime and is modified with irregular diacritics. Starting with stage 2, there are two tone-classes of rime, just as in Lao there are two tone-classes of consonant.

Nearly all other scripts invented by illiterates are [[syllabary|syllabaries]] like Cherokee. However, to represent Hmong as a syllabary, Pahawh would have needed 60×91 = 5460 letters. By breaking each syllable in two in the fashion of Chinese phonetics, Shong was able to write Hmong, in his original version, with a mere 60+91 = 151 letters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3346">The '''parallel individuation system''', also called '''object tracking system''' is a non-[[symbol]]ic [[cognition|cognitive]] system that supports the representation of numerical values from zero to three (in [[infant]]s) or four (in adults and non-human animals).

==Evidence==
The evidence for parallel individuation system comes from a number of [[experiment]]s on adults, infants and non-human animals. For example, adults perform error-free when they enumerate elements for numerosities from one to four, after which their error rate rises.&lt;ref name=Feigenson/&gt; Similarly, infants of 10 to 12 months represented the values for "exactly one", "exactly two" and "exactly three", but not for higher numbers, in a task based on hidden object retrieval.&lt;ref name=Feigenson/&gt;

[[Number sense in animals|Parallel individuation system in animals]] was demonstrated in an experiment in which [[guppy|guppies]] were tested on their preference of social groups of different size, under the assumption that they have a preference for bigger size groups. In this experiment, fish successfully discriminated between numbers from 1 to 4 but after this number their performance decreased.&lt;ref name=agrillo/&gt; However, not all studies find confirmation of this system and for example [[Petroicidae|New Zealand robins]] showed no difference in their understanding of small (1 to 4) and larger (above 4) amounts.&lt;ref name="Hunt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Simon|author2=Low, Jason|author3=Burns, K.|title=Adaptive numerical competency in a food-hoarding songbird.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|year=2008|volume=275|doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0702|pages=2373–2379|pmc=2603231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Personality''' is defined as the characteristic set of [[behavior]]s, [[cognition]]s, and [[emotion]]al patterns that evolve from biological and environmental factors.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corr|first1=Philip J.|last2=Matthews|first2=Gerald|title=The Cambridge handbook of personality psychology|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, U.K.|isbn=978-0-521-86218-9|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no generally agreed upon definition of personality, most theories focus on motivation and psychological interactions with one's environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sadock|first1=Benjamin|last2=Sadock|first2=Virginia|last3=Ruiz|first3=Pedro|title=Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|isbn=9781451100471}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trait-based personality theories, such as those defined by [[Raymond Cattell]] define personality as the traits that predict a person's behavior. On the other hand, more behaviorally based approaches define personality through learning and habits.  Nevertheless, most theories view personality as relatively stable.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

The study of the psychology of personality, called [[personality psychology]], attempts to explain the tendencies that underlie differences in behavior.  Many approaches have been taken on to study personality, including biological, cognitive, learning and trait based theories, as well as psychodynamic, and humanistic approaches.  Personality psychology is divided among the first theorists, with a few influential theories being posited by [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Alfred Adler]], [[Gordon Allport]], [[Hans Eysenck]], [[Abraham Maslow]], and [[Carl Rogers]].

==Measuring==
Personality can be determined through a variety of tests. However, dimensions of personality and scales of personality tests vary and often are poorly defined. Examples of such tests are the: [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five Inventory]] (BFI), [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]] (MMPI-2), [[Rorschach test|Rorschach Inkblot test]], [[Neurotic Personality Questionnaire KON-2006]],&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span lang="PL"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.archivespp.pl/uploads/images/2009_11_1/21_p_Archives_1_09.pdf|vauthors=Aleksandrowicz JW, Klasa K, Sobański JA, Stolarska D|title=KON-2006 Neurotic Personality Questionnaire|journal=Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy|year=2009|volume=1|pages=21–2}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enneagram of Personality|Enneagram]] test, or [[Hans Eysenck|Eysenck's]] Personality Questionnaire (EPQ-R).

==Five-factor model==
Personality is often broken into statistically-identified factors called the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]], which are [[openness to experience]], [[conscientiousness]], [[Extraversion and introversion|extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], and [[neuroticism]] (or emotional stability). These components are generally stable over time, and about half of the variance appears to be attributable to a person's genetics rather than the effects of one's environment.&lt;ref name="Lucas &amp; Baird"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Briley2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Briley, D. A., Tucker-Drob, E. M.|year=2014|title= Genetic and environmental continuity in personality development: A meta-analysis|journal= Psychological Bulletin|volume=140|issue=5|pages=1303–31|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263324524_Genetic_and_Environmental_Continuity_in_Personality_Development_A_Meta-Analysis|doi=10.1037/a0037091|pmid=24956122|pmc=4152379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research has investigated whether the relationship between happiness and extraversion seen in adults can also be seen in children. The implications of these findings can help identify children that are more likely to experience episodes of depression and develop types of treatment that such children are likely to respond to. In both children and adults, research shows that genetics, as opposed to environmental factors, exert a greater influence on happiness levels. Personality is not stable over the course of a lifetime, but it changes much more quickly during childhood, so personality constructs in children are referred to as temperament. Temperament is regarded as the precursor to personality.&lt;ref name="Holder &amp; Klassen"&gt;Holder &amp; Klassen 2010, p. 419–439.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas McCrae and Costa's Big Five model assesses personality traits in adults, the EAS (emotionality, activity, and sociability) model is used to assess temperament in children. This model measures levels of emotionality, activity, sociability, and shyness in children. The personality theorists consider temperament EAS model similar to the Big Five model in adults; however, this might be due to a conflation of concepts of personality and temperament as described above. Findings show that high degrees of sociability and low degrees of shyness are equivalent to adult extraversion, and correlate with higher levels of [[life satisfaction]] in children.

Another interesting finding has been the link found between acting extraverted and positive affect. Extraverted behaviors include acting talkative, assertive, adventurous, and outgoing. For the purposes of this study, positive affect is defined as experiences of happy and enjoyable emotions.&lt;ref name="Zelenski, Santoro, &amp; Whelan"&gt;Zelenski, Santoro, &amp; Whelan, p. 290-303.&lt;/ref&gt; This study investigated the effects of acting in a way that is counter to a person's dispositional nature. In other words, the study focused on the benefits and drawbacks of introverts (people who are shy, socially inhibited and non-aggressive) acting extraverted, and of extraverts acting introverted. After acting extraverted, introverts' experience of positive affect increased&lt;ref name="Zelenski, Santoro, &amp; Whelan" /&gt; whereas extraverts seemed to experience lower levels of positive affect and suffered from the phenomenon of ego depletion. [[Ego depletion]], or cognitive fatigue, is the use of one's energy to overtly act in a way that is contrary to one's inner disposition. When people act in a contrary fashion, they divert most, if not all, (cognitive) energy toward regulating this foreign style of behavior and attitudes. Because all available energy is being used to maintain this contrary behavior, the result is an inability to use any energy to make important or difficult decisions, plan for the future, control or regulate emotions, or perform effectively on other cognitive tasks.&lt;ref name="Zelenski, Santoro, &amp; Whelan" /&gt;

One question that has been posed is why extraverts tend to be happier than introverts. The two types of explanations attempt to account for this difference are instrumental theories and temperamental theories.&lt;ref name="Lucas &amp; Baird"&gt;Lucas &amp; Baird 2004, p. 473-485.&lt;/ref&gt; The instrumental theory suggests that extraverts end up making choices that place them in more positive situations and they also react more strongly than introverts to positive situations. The temperamental theory suggests that extraverts have a disposition that generally leads them to experience a higher degree of positive affect. In their study of extraversion, Lucas and Baird&lt;ref name="Lucas &amp; Baird" /&gt; found no statistically significant support for the instrumental theory but did, however, find that extraverts generally experience a higher level of positive affect. 	

Research has been done to uncover some of the mediators that are responsible for the correlation between extraversion and happiness. Self-esteem and self-efficacy are two such mediators. Self-efficacy has been found to be related to the personality traits of extraversion and subjective well-being.&lt;ref name="Strobel et al"&gt;Strobel, Tumasjan, &amp; Sporrle, p. 43-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-efficacy is one's belief about abilities to perform up to personal standards, the ability to produce desired results, and the feeling of having some ability to make important life decisions.&lt;ref name="Strobel et al" /&gt; However, the relationship between extraversion (and neuroticism) and subjective happiness is only partially mediated by self-efficacy.&lt;ref name="Strobel et al" /&gt; This implies that there are most likely other factors that mediate the relationship between subjective happiness and personality traits. Another such factor may be self-esteem. Individuals with a greater degree of confidence about themselves and their abilities seem to have both higher degrees of subjective well-being and higher levels of extraversion.&lt;ref&gt;Joshanloo &amp; Afshari 2009, p. 105-113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research has examined the phenomenon of mood maintenance as another possible mediator. Mood maintenance, the ability to maintain one's average level of happiness in the face of an ambiguous situation (meaning a situation that has the potential to engender either positive or negative emotions in different individuals), has been found to be a stronger force in extraverts.&lt;ref name="Lischetzke &amp; Eid"&gt;Lischetzke &amp; Eid 2006, p. 1127-1162.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the happiness levels of extraverted individuals are less susceptible to the influence of external events. Another implication of this finding is that extraverts' positive moods last longer than those of introverts.&lt;ref name="Lischetzke &amp; Eid" /&gt;

==Developmental biological model==

Modern conceptions of personality, such as the [[Temperament and Character Inventory]] have suggested four basic temperaments that are thought to reflect basic and automatic responses to danger and reward that rely on associative learning.  The four temperaments, ''harm avoidance'', ''reward dependence'', ''novelty seeking'' and ''persistence'' are somewhat analogous to ancient conceptions of melancholic, sanguine, choleric, phlegmatic personality types, although the temperaments reflect dimensions rather than distance categories.  While factor based approaches to personality have yielded models that account for significant variance, the developmental biological model has been argued to better reflect underlying biological processes.  Distinct genetic, neurochemical and neuroanatomical correlates responsible for each temperamental trait have been observed, unlike with five factor models.

The harm avoidance trait has been associated with increased reactivity in insular and amygdala salience networks, as well as reduced 5-HT2 receptor binding peripherally, and reduced GABA concentrations.  Novelty seeking has been associated with reduced activity in insular salience networks increased striatal connectivity.  Novelty seeking correlates with dopamine synthesis capacity in the striatum, and reduced auto receptor availability in the midbrain.  Reward dependence has been linked with the [[oxytocin]] system, with increased concentration of plasma oxytocin being observed, as well as increased volume in oxytocin related regions of the [[hypothalamus]].  Persistence has been associated with increased striatal-[[mPFC]] connectivity, increased activation of ventral striatal-orbitofrontal-anterior cingulate circuits, as well as increased salivary amylase levels indicative of increased noradrenergic tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=B|first1=Sadock|last2=V|first2=Sadock|last3=P|first3=Ruiz|editor1-last=Cloninger|editor1-first=R|editor2-last=Svrakic|editor2-first=D|title=Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry|publisher=Wolter Kluwer|isbn=978-1-4511-0047-1|chapter=Personality Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental influences ==
It has been shown that personality traits are more malleable by environmental influences than researchers originally believed.&lt;ref name="Briley2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Jeronimus, B. F., Riese, H., Sanderman, R., Ormel, J.|year=2014|title= Mutual Reinforcement Between Neuroticism and Life Experiences: A Five-Wave, 16-Year Study to Test Reciprocal Causation|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=107|issue=4|pages=751–64|url= http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/107/4/751|doi=10.1037/a0037009|pmid=25111305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personality differences predict the occurrence of life experiences.&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2014" /&gt;

One study that has shown how the home environment, specifically the types of parents a person has, can affect and shape their personality. Mary Ainsworth's [[Strange situation|Strange Situation]] experiment showcased how babies reacted to having their mother leave them alone in a room with a stranger. The different styles of attachment, labelled by Ainsworth, were Secure, Ambivalent, avoidant, and disorganized. Children who were securely attached tend to be more trusting, sociable, and are confident in their day-to-day life. Children who were disorganized were reported to have higher levels of anxiety, anger, and risk-taking behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Children and Their Development|last=Kail|first=Robert|last2=Barnfield|first2=Anne|publisher=Pearson|year=2014|isbn=9780205993024|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judith Rich Harris]]'s group socialization theory postulates that an individual's peer groups, rather than parental figures, are the primary influence of personality and behavior in adulthood. Intra- and intergroup processes, not dyadic relationships such as parent-child relationships, are responsible for the transmission of culture and for environmental modification of children's personality characteristics. Thus, this theory points at the peer group representing the environmental influence on a child's personality rather than the parental style or home environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Judith Rich|date=1995|title=Where is the child's environment? A group socialization theory of development.|url=https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.102.3.458|journal=Psychological Review|volume=102|issue=3|pages=458–489|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.102.3.458|issn=1939-1471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tessuya Kawamoto's ''Personality Change from Life Experiences: Moderation Effect of Attachment Security'' talked about laboratory tests. The study mainly focused on the effects of life experiences on change in personality on and life experiences. The assessments suggested that "the accumulation of small daily experiences may work for the personality development of university students and that environmental influences may vary by individual susceptibility to experiences, like attachment security".&lt;ref&gt;Kawamoto, Tetsuya. "Personality Change from Life Experiences: Moderation Effect of Attachment Security." Japanese Psychological Research, vol. 58, no. 2, Apr. 2016, pp. 218-231. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1111/jpr.12110&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross-cultural studies==
There has been some recent debate over the subject of studying personality in a different culture. Some people think that personality comes entirely from culture and therefore there can be no meaningful study in cross-culture study. On the other hand, others believe that some elements are shared by all cultures and an effort is being made to demonstrate the cross-cultural applicability of "the Big Five".&lt;ref&gt;[[David C. Funder|Funder, D.C.]], (2001). Personality. Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2001. 52:197–221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross-cultural assessment depends on the universality of personality traits, which is whether there are common traits among humans regardless of culture or other factors. If there is a common foundation of personality, then it can be studied on the basis of human traits rather than within certain cultures. This can be measured by comparing whether assessment tools are measuring similar constructs across countries or cultures. Two approaches to researching personality are looking at emic and etic traits. Emic traits are constructs unique to each culture, which are determined by local customs, thoughts, beliefs, and characteristics. Etic traits are considered universal constructs, which establish traits that are evident across cultures that represent a biological bases of human personality.&lt;ref&gt;McCrae, R. R., &amp; Allik, I. U. (2002). The five-factor model of personality across cultures. Springer Science &amp; Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt; If personality traits are unique to individual culture, then different traits should be apparent in different cultures. However, the idea that personality traits are universal across cultures is supported by establishing the Five Factor Model of personality across multiple translations of the NEO-PI-R, which is one of the most widely used personality measures.&lt;ref name="McCrae, R. R. 1997"&gt;McCrae, R. R., &amp; Costa Jr, P. T. (1997). Personality trait structure as a human universal. American psychologist, 52(5), 509.&lt;/ref&gt; When administering the NEO-PI-R to 7,134 people across six languages, the results show a similar pattern of the same five underlying constructs that are found in the American factor structure.&lt;ref name="McCrae, R. R. 1997"/&gt;

Similar results were found using the Big Five Inventory (BFI), as it was administered in 56 nations across 28 languages. The five factors continued to be supported both conceptually and statistically across major regions of the world, suggesting that these underlying factors are common across cultures.&lt;ref name="Schmitt, D. P. 2007"&gt;Schmitt, D. P., Allik, J., McCrae, R. R., &amp; Benet-Martínez, V. (2007). The geographic distribution of Big Five personality traits: Patterns and profiles of human self-description across 56 nations. Journal of cross-cultural psychology, 38(2), 173-212.&lt;/ref&gt; There are some differences across culture but they may be a consequence of using a lexical approach to study personality structures, as language has limitations in translation and different cultures have unique words to describe emotion or situations.&lt;ref name="McCrae, R. R. 1997"/&gt; For example, the term "feeling blue" is used to describe sadness in more Westernized cultures, but does not translate to other languages.  Differences across cultures could be due to real cultural differences, but they could also be consequences of poor translations, biased sampling, or differences in response styles across cultures.&lt;ref name="Schmitt, D. P. 2007"/&gt;  Examining personality questionnaires developed within a culture can also be useful evidence for the universality of traits across cultures, as the same underlying factors can still be found.&lt;ref name="Church, A. T. 2000"&gt;Church, A. T. (2000). Culture and personality: Toward an integrated cultural trait psychology. Journal of Personality, 68(4), 651-703.&lt;/ref&gt; Results from several European and Asian studies have found overlapping dimensions with the Five Factor Model as well as additional culture-unique dimensions.&lt;ref name="Church, A. T. 2000"/&gt; Finding similar factors across cultures provides support for the universality of personality trait structure, but more research is necessary to gain stronger support.&lt;ref name="McCrae, R. R. 1997"/&gt;

==Historical development of concept==
The modern sense of individual personality is a result of the shifts in culture originating in the [[Renaissance]], an essential element in [[modernity]]. In contrast, the Medieval European's sense of [[self]] was linked to a network of social roles: "the [[Medieval household|household]], the [[Kinship|kinship network]], the [[guild]], the [[Corporation (feudal Europe)|corporation]] – these were the building blocks of personhood", [[Stephen Greenblatt]] observes, in recounting the recovery (1417) and career of [[Lucretius]]' poem ''[[De rerum natura]]'': "at the core of the poem lay key principles of a modern understanding of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Greenblatt, ''The Swerve: how the world became modern'', 2011:3, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; "Dependent on the [[family]], the individual alone was nothing," Jacques Gélis observes.&lt;ref&gt;Gélis, "The Child: from anonymity to individuality", in Philippe Ariès and Georges Duby, ''A History of Private Life III: Passions of the Renaissance'' 1989:309.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temperament and philosophy==
[[File:Wm james.jpg|thumb|William James (1842-1910)]]
[[William James]] (1842-1910) argued that '''temperament''' explains a great deal of the controversies in the history of philosophy by arguing that it is a very influential premise in the arguments of philosophers. Despite seeking only impersonal reasons for their conclusions, James argued, the temperament of philosophers influenced their philosophy. Temperament thus conceived is tantamount to a bias. Such bias, James explained, was a consequence of the trust philosophers place in their own temperament. James thought the significance of his observation lay on the premise that in philosophy an objective measure of success is whether a philosophy is peculiar to its philosopher or not, and whether a philosopher is dissatisfied with any other way of seeing things or not.&lt;ref name="Pragmatism and Other Essays"&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=William|title=Pragmatism and Other Essays|date=1970|publisher=Washington Square Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mental make-up ===
James argued that temperament may be the basis of several divisions in academia,  but focused on philosophy in his 1907 lectures on ''[[Pragmatism]]''. In fact, James' lecture of 1907 fashioned a sort of trait theory of the empiricist and rationalist camps of philosophy. As in most modern trait theories, the traits of each camp are described by James as distinct and opposite, and may be possessed in different proportions on a continuum, and thus characterize the personality of philosophers of each camp.  The "mental make-up" (i.e. personality) of rationalist philosophers is described as "tender-minded" and "going by "principles," and that of empiricist philosophers is described as "tough-minded" and "going by "facts." James distinguishes each not only in terms of the philosophical claims they made in 1907, but by arguing that such claims are made primarily on the basis of temperament. Furthermore, such categorization was only incidental to James' purpose of explaining his pragmatist philosophy, and is not exhaustive.&lt;ref name="Pragmatism and Other Essays"/&gt;
		
===Empiricists and rationalists===
[[File:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|John Locke (1632–1704)]]
According to James, the ''temperament'' of [[rationalism|rationalist]] philosophers differed fundamentally from the ''temperament'' of [[empiricism|empiricist]] philosophers of his day. The tendency of rationalist philosophers toward ''refinement'' and ''superficiality'' never satisfied an empiricist temper of mind. Rationalism leads to the creation of ''closed systems'', and such optimism is considered shallow by the fact-loving mind, for whom perfection is far off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=William|title=Pragmatism and other essays|date=1970|publisher=Washington Square Press|location=New York|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rationalism is regarded as ''pretension'', and a temperament most inclined to ''abstraction''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=William|title=Pragmatism and other essays|date=1970|publisher=Washington Square Press|location=New York|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temperament of rationalists, according to James, led to sticking with logic.

[[empiricism|Empiricists]], on the other hand, stick with the external senses rather than logic. British empiricist [[John Locke|John Locke's]]  (1632–1704) explanation of personal identity provides an example of what James referred to. Locke explains the identity of a person, i.e. personality, on the basis of a precise definition of identity, by which the meaning of identity differs according to what it is being applied to. The identity of a person, is quite distinct from the identity of a man, woman, or substance according to Locke. Locke concludes that consciousness is personality because it "always accompanies thinking, it is that which makes every one to be what he calls self,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Locke|first1=John|title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|date=1974|publisher=Random House|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remains constant in different places at different times. Thus his explanation of personal identity is in terms of experience as James indeed maintained is the case for most empiricists.
[[File:Benedictus (Baruch) Spinoza (anoniem schilderij, Gemeentemuseum Den Haag), Bestanddeelnr 935-0843.jpg|thumb|Benedictus Spinoza (1632–1677)]]
Rationalists conceived of the identity of persons differently than empiricists such as Locke who distinguished identity of substance, person, and life. According to Locke, [[Rene Descartes]]  (1596–1650) agreed only insofar as he did not argue that one immaterial spirit is the basis of the person "for fear of making brutes thinking things too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=William|title=Pragmatism and other essays|date=1970|publisher=Washington Square Press|location=New York|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to James, Locke tolerated arguments that a soul was behind the consciousness of any person. However, Locke's successor [[David Hume]]  (1711–1776), and empirical psychologists after him denied the soul except for being a term to describe the cohesion of inner lives.&lt;ref name="Pragmatism and Other Essays"/&gt; However, some research suggests Hume excluded personal identity from his opus [[David Hume|An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding]] because he thought his argument was sufficient but not compelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hume|first1=David|title=An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding|date=1955|publisher=Liberal Arts Press Inc|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Descartes]] himself distinguished active and passive faculties of mind, each contributing to thinking and consciousness in different ways. The passive faculty, Descartes argued, simply receives, whereas the active faculty produces and forms ideas, but does not presuppose thought, and thus cannot be within the thinking thing. The active faculty mustn't be within self because ideas are produced without any awareness of them, and are sometimes produced against one's will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Descartes|first1=Rene|title=Meditations on the First Philosophy|date=1974|publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rationalist philosopher [[Spinoza|Benedictus Spinoza]] (1632–1677) argued that ideas are the first element constituting the human mind, but existed only for actually existing things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedictus|title=The Ethics|date=1974|publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York|edition=The Rationalists}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, ideas of non-existent things are without meaning for Spinoza, because an idea of a non-existent thing cannot exist. Further, Spinoza's rationalism argued that the mind does not know itself, except insofar as it perceives the "ideas of the modifications of body," in describing its external perceptions, or perceptions from without. On the contrary, from within, Spinoza argued, perceptions connect various ideas clearly and distinctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedictus|title=The Ethics|date=1974|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=241|edition=The Rationalists}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mind is not the free cause of its actions for Spinoza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedictus|title=The Ethics|date=1974|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=253|edition=The Rationalists}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza equates the will with the understanding, and explains the common distinction of these things as being two different things as error which results from the individual's misunderstanding of the nature of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedictus|title=The Ethics|date=1974|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=256|edition=The Rationalists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==

The [[biological basis of personality]] is the theory that anatomical structures located in the [[brain]] contribute to personality traits. This stems from [[neuropsychology]], which studies how the structure of the brain relates to various psychological processes and behaviors. For instance, in [[human|human beings]], the [[frontal lobe]]s are responsible for foresight and anticipation, and the [[occipital lobe]]s are responsible for processing visual information. In addition, certain physiological functions such as hormone secretion also affect personality. For example, the [[hormone]] [[testosterone]] is important for sociability, affectivity, [[aggression|aggressiveness]], and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Funder|first=David|title=PERSONALITY|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=February 2001|volume=52|issue=1|pages=197–221|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, studies show that the expression of a personality trait depends on the volume of the brain cortex it is associated with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeYoung|first=Colin G.|title=Testing Predictions From Personality Neuroscience: Brain Structures and the Big Five|journal=Psychological Science|date=June 2010|volume=21|issue=6|pages=820–828|doi=10.1177/0956797610370159|pmid=20435951|pmc=3049165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a confusion among some psychologists who conflate personality with temperament. Temperament traits that are based on weak neurochemical imbalances within neurotransmitter systems are much more stable, consistent in behavior and show up in early childhood; they can't be changed easily but can be compensated for in behavior. In contrast to that, personality traits and features are the product of the socio-cultural development of humans and can be learned and/or changed.

== Personology ==
Personology confers a multidimensional, complex, and comprehensive approach to personality. From a holistic perspective, personology studies personality as a whole, as a system, but in the same time through all its components, levels and spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, H.A. (1938).

[[File:Max stirner.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Stirner by philosophical rival [[Friedrich Engels]]]]
The '''philosophy of Max Stirner''' is credited as a major influence in the development of [[individualism]], [[nihilism]], [[existentialism]], [[post-modernism]] and [[anarchism]] (especially of [[egoist anarchism]], [[individualist anarchism]], [[postanarchism]] and [[post-left anarchy]]). [[Max Stirner]]'s main philosophical work was ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', also known as ''The Ego and His Own'' (''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum'' in German, or more accurately ''The Individual and his Property''). Stirner's philosophy has been cited as an influence on both his contemporaries, most notably [[Karl Marx]] (who was strongly opposed to Stirner's views)&lt;ref&gt;Marx reacted to Stirner with a voluminous polemics ''Saint Max'', that he never published; cf. [http://question-everything.mahost.org/Archive/MarxAndStirner.doc Nicholas Lobkowicz: ''Karl Marx and Max Stirner.''] In: Frederick J. Adelmann (ed.): ''Demythologizing Marxism: A Series Of Studies On Marxism''. Boston: Boston College Chestnut Hill 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as subsequent thinkers such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],&lt;ref&gt;The possible influence on Nietzsche was a heavily disputed topic around 1900 and recently again. For a summary and a fresh view, see [http://www.lsr-projekt.de/poly/ennietzsche.html ''Bernd A. Laska: Nietzsche's Initial Crisis''] (2002); [[#See also|See also]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enrico Arrigoni]], [[Steven T. Byington]], [[Benjamin R. Tucker]], [[Emile Armand]], [[Albert Camus]]&lt;ref name="camus"&gt;"[[Albert Camus]] devotes a section of ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]'' to Stirner". [http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/00/pwillen1/lit/egomax.htm "The Egoism of Max Stirner"] by Sidney Parker.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saul Newman]].

== Thought ==
=== The self ===
Stirner argues that the concept of the self is something impossible to fully comprehend; a so-called "creative nothing" he described as an "end-point of language": {{quotation|The Unique One is the straightforward, sincere, plain-phrase. It is the end point of our phrase world, of this world in whose "beginning was the Word."|Max Stirner|''Stirner's Critics''}}

In order to understand this creative nothing, Stirner uses poetry and vivid imagery. The creative nothing by its dialectical shortcomings creates the need for a description, for meaning: {{quotation|What Stirner says is a word, a thought, a concept; what he means is no word, no thought, no concept. What he says is not what is meant, and what he means is unsayable.|Max Stirner|''Stirner's Critics''}}

Stirner elaborated this attempt to describe the indescribable in the essay ''Stirner's Critics'', written by Stirner in response to Feuerbach and others (in custom with the time, he refers to himself in the third person): {{quotation|Stirner speaks of the Unique and says immediately: Names name you not. He articulates the word, so long as he calls it the Unique, but adds nonetheless that the Unique is only a name. He thus means something different from what he says, as perhaps someone who calls you Ludwig does not mean a Ludwig in general, but means You, for which he has no word. [...] It is the end point of our phrase world, of this world in whose "beginning was the Word."|Max Stirner|''Stirner's Critics''}}

''The Ego and Its Own'' opens and closes with a quotation from [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] that reads "I have taken up my cause without foundation", with the unstated next line of the poem being "and all the world is mine". One of Stirner's central ideas is that in realizing the self is "nothing" one is said to "own the world" because—as the book states in its last line—"all things are nothing to me" [''Ibidem'', p.&amp;nbsp;324]: {{quotation|By bringing the essence into prominence one degrades the hitherto misapprehended appearance to a bare semblance, a deception. The essence of the world, so attractive and splendid, is for him who looks to the bottom of it—emptiness; emptiness is—world's essence (world's doings).|Max Stirner|''The Ego and Its Own'', p. 40}}
{{quotation|[F]or 'being' is abstraction, as is even 'the I'. Only I am not abstraction alone: I am all in all, consequently, even abstraction or nothing: I am all and nothing; I am not a mere thought, but at the same time I am full of thoughts, a thought-world.|Max Stirner|''The Ego and Its Own'', p. 300}}
{{quotation|I say: liberate yourself as far as you can, and you have done your part; for it is not given to every one to break through all limits, or, more expressively, not to everyone is that a limit which is a limit for the rest. Consequently, do not tire yourself with toiling at the limits of others; enough if you tear down yours. [...] He who overturns one of his limits may have shown others the way and the means; the overturning of their limits remains their affair.|Max Stirner|''The Ego and Its Own'', p. 127}}

Stirner describes this world view in brief as "enjoyment" and claims that the "nothingness" of the non-self is "unutterable" (p.&amp;nbsp;314) or "unnameable" (p.&amp;nbsp;132), "unspeakable" yet "a mere word" (p.&amp;nbsp;164; cf. Stirner's comments on the skeptic concepts ataraxia and aphasia, p.&amp;nbsp;26).

=== Egoism ===
Stirner has been broadly understood as a proponent of both [[psychological egoism]] and [[ethical egoism]], although the latter position can be disputed as there is no claim in Stirner's writing in which one ought to pursue one's own interest and further claiming any "ought" could be seen as a new "fixed idea". Therefore, he may be understood as a [[rational egoist]] in the sense that he considered it irrational not to act in one's self-interest. However, how this self-interest is defined is necessarily subjective, allowing both selfish and altruistic normative claims to be included. Further, rationality as an end in and of itself is another fixed idea.

Individual self-realization rests on each individual's desire to fulfill their [[Egoist anarchism|egoism]]. The difference between an unwilling and a willing egoist is that the former will be 'possessed' by an empty idea and believe that they are fulfilling a higher cause, but usually being unaware that they are only fulfilling their own desires to be happy or secure; and the latter, in contrast, will be a person that is able to freely choose its actions, fully aware that they are only fulfilling individual desires: {{quotation|Sacred things exist only for the egoist who does not acknowledge himself, the ''involuntary egoist'' [...] in short, for the egoist who would like not to be an egoist, and abases himself (combats his egoism), but at the same time abases himself only for the sake of "being exalted", and therefore of gratifying his egoism. Because he would like to cease to be an egoist, he looks about in heaven and earth for higher beings to serve and sacrifice himself to; but, however much he shakes and disciplines himself, in the end he does all for his own sake [...]. On this account I call him the involuntary egoist.

[...] As you are each instant, you are your own creature in this very 'creature' you do not wish to lose yourself, the creator. You are yourself a higher being than you are, and surpass yourself [...] just this, as an involuntary egoist, you fail to recognize; and therefore the 'higher essence' is to you—an alien essence. [...] Alienness is a criterion of the "sacred" [''Ibidem'', Cambridge edition, pp. 37–38].}}

The contrast is also expressed in terms of the difference between the voluntary egoist being the possessor of his concepts as opposed to being possessed. Only when one realizes that all sacred truths such as [[law]], [[Rights|right]], [[morality]], [[religion]] and so on are nothing other than artificial concepts and not to be obeyed can one act freely. For Stirner, to be free is to be both one's own "creature" (in the sense of 'creation') and one's own "creator" (dislocating the traditional role assigned to the gods). To Stirner, power is the method of egoism. It is the only justified method of gaining '[[property]]'. Even [[love]] is explained as "consciously egoistic": {{quotation|[L]ove cuts no better figure than any other passion [if] I obey [it] blindly. The ambitious man, who is carried away by ambition [...] has let this passion grow up into a despot against whom he abandons all power of dissolution; he has given up himself because he cannot ''dissolve'' himself, and consequently cannot absolve himself from the passion: he is possessed.

I love men too—not merely individuals, but every one. But I love them with the consciousness of my egoism; I love them because love makes ''me'' happy, I love because loving is natural to me, it pleases me. I know no 'commandment of love'. I have a ''fellow-feeling'' with every feeling being, and their torment torments, their refreshment refreshes me too [''Ibidem'', p. 258].}}

However, Stirner cautioned against any [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]] of the egoist or subject: {{quotation|The egoist, before whom the humane shudder, is a spook as much as the devil is: he exists only as a bogie and phantasm in their brain. If they were not unsophisticatedly drifting back and forth in the antediluvian opposition of good and evil, to which they have given the modern names of "human" and "egoistic," they would not have freshened up the hoary "sinner" into an "egoist" either, and put a new patch on an old garment [Second Part: The Owner: 3 – My Self Enjoyment].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsr-projekt.de/poly/enee.html#secondii3 ''Max Stirner - The Ego and Its Own''].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Anarchism ===
{{main|Egoist anarchism|Individualist anarchism in Europe}}
Stirner proposes that most commonly accepted social institutions&amp;mdash;including the notion of state, property as a right, [[natural rights]] in general and the very notion of society&amp;mdash;were mere illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society that "the individuals are its reality". Stirner wants to "abolish not only the state but also society as an institution responsible for its members".&lt;ref&gt;Heider, Ulrike. ''Anarchism: Left, Right and Green'', San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1994, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

He advocated egoism and a form of [[amoralism]] in which individuals would unite in "[[Union of egoists]]" only when it was in their self-interest to do so. For him, property simply comes about through might: "Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property. [...] "What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing". He says: "I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing. Pray do the like with what you call my property!".&lt;ref name="Stirner, Max p. 248"&gt;Stirner, Max. ''The Ego and Its Own''. p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner considers the world and everything in it, including other persons, available to one's taking or use without moral constraint&lt;ref name="Moggach, Douglas p. 194"&gt;Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;—that rights do not exist in regard to objects and people at all. He sees no rationality in taking the interests of others into account unless doing so furthers one's self-interest, which he believes is the only legitimate reason for acting. He denies society as being an actual entity: "The conquerors form a society which one may imagine so great that it by degrees embraces all humanity; but so-called humanity too is as such only a thought (spook); the individuals are its reality" (''The Ego and Its Own'', Tucker ed., p.&amp;nbsp;329).

Stirner never referred to markets and his philosophy on property causes problems for a market system because—according to proponents of markets—property is not considered to be legitimate if taken by force. Stirner was opposed to communism, seeing it as a form of authority over the individual. He said in ''The Ego and Its Own'': {{quotation|All attempts to enact rational laws about property have put out from the bay of ''love'' into a desolate sea of regulations. Even Socialism and Communism cannot be excepted from this. Everyone one is to be provided with adequate means, for which it is little to the point whether one socialistically finds them still in a personal property, or communistically draws them from a [[Common ownership|community of goods]]. The individual's mind in this remains the same; it remains a mind of dependence. The distributing ''board of equity'' lets me have only what the sense of equity, its ''loving'' care for all, prescribes. For me, the individual, there lies no less of a check in collective wealth than in that of ''individual others''; neither that is mind, nor this: whether the wealth belongs to the collectivity, which confers part of it on me, or to individual possessors, is for me the same constraint, as I cannot decide about either of the two. One the Contrary, Communism, by the abolition of all personal property, only presses me back still more into dependence on another, ''viz.'', on the generality or collectivity; and, loudly as it always attacks the "State," what it intends is itself again a State, a ''status'', a condition hindering my free movement, a sovereign power over me. Communism rightly revolts against the pressure I experience from individual proprietors; but still more horrible is the might that it puts in the hands of the collectivity. Egoism takes another way to root out the non-possessing rabble. It does not say: Wait for what the board of equity will—bestow on you in the name of the collectivity (for such bestowal took place in "States" from the most ancient times, each receiving "according to his desert," and therefore according to the measure in which each was able to ''deserve'' it, to acquire it by ''service''), but: Take hold, and take what you require! With this the war of all against all is declared. ''I'' alone decide what I will have.&lt;ref&gt;Stirner, Max. ''The Ego and Its Own''. Rebel Press. 1982. p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Property ====
Stirner has a concept of "egoistic property" in which he is referring to the absence of moral restrictions on how the individual uses everything in the world, including other people.&lt;ref name="Moggach, Douglas p. 194"/&gt; For Stirner, property come about through might: "Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property. [...] What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing". He says: "I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing. Pray do the like with what you call my property!".&lt;ref name="Stirner, Max p. 248"/&gt; This position on property is much different from the then prevalent form of individualist anarchism, which defended the inviolability of the private property that has been earned through labour.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, David. Anarchy &amp; Culture. [[University of Massachusetts Press]]. 1997. p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[American individualist anarchist]] [[Benjamin Tucker]] rejected the [[natural rights]] philosophy and adopted Stirner's egoism in 1886, with several others joining with him. Since he was a radical anarchist, he preferred a political-economic social condition that was anti-statist, anti-capitalist and anti-authoritarian completely void of authoritarian monopolies (whether they positioned themselves as property or sovereignty) which were the enemies of individual liberation. Stirner's egoist anarchism is all about freeing the individual from the domination of property monopolists such as monarchs, governments, or industrialists while at the same time it positions itself against the anti-individualist nature of the traditional political left. Stirner had no concrete dogma on the issue of property and simply urged individuals to stop being ruled by others regardless of the authorities' moral claims about political sovereignty or property rights.

==== Union of egoists ====
{{main|Union of egoists}}
Stirner's idea of the "Union of egoists" was first expounded in ''The Ego and Its Own''. The Union is understood as a non-systematic association, which Stirner proposed in contradistinction to the [[Sovereign state|state]].&lt;ref name=karl&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Paul|title=Karl Marx and the Anarchists|publisher=[[Routledge]]/[[Kegan Paul]]|location=London|year=1985|isbn=0-7102-0685-2|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union is understood as a relation between egoists which is continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will.&lt;ref name=nonserviam&gt;{{citation|url=http://i-studies.com/journal/n/pdf/nsi-17.pdf#page=13|title=The union of egoists|journal=Non Serviam|volume=1|first=Svein Olav|last=Nyberg|pages=13–14|location=Oslo, Norway|publisher=Svein Olav Nyberg|oclc=47758413|accessdate=1 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207042220/http://i-studies.com/journal/n/pdf/nsi-17.pdf#page=13|archivedate=7 December 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union requires that all parties participate out of a [[Selfishness|conscious egoism]]. If one party silently finds themselves to be suffering, but puts up and keeps the appearance, the union has degenerated into something else.&lt;ref name=nonserviam/&gt; This Union is not seen as an [[authority]] above a person's own will.

==== Revolution ====
Stirner criticizes conventional notions of [[revolution]], arguing that [[social movement]]s aimed at overturning the state are tacitly statist because they are implicitly aimed at the establishment of a new state thereafter. To illustrate this argument, he compares his own social and moral role with that of [[Jesus Christ]]: {{quotation|The time [in which Jesus lived] was politically so agitated that, as is said in the gospels, people thought they could not accuse the founder of Christianity more successfully than if they arraigned him for 'political intrigue', and yet the same gospels report that he was precisely the one who took the least part in these political doings.  But why was he not a revolutionary, not a demagogue, as the Jews would gladly have seen him? [...] Because he expected no salvation from a change of conditions, and this whole business was indifferent to him.  He was not a revolutionary, like Caesar, but an insurgent: not a state-overturner, but one who straightened himself up. [...] [Jesus] was not carrying on any liberal or political fight against the established authorities, but wanted to walk his own way, untroubled about, and undisturbed by, these authorities. [...] But, even though not a ringleader of popular mutiny, not a demagogue or revolutionary, he (and every one of the ancient Christians) was so much the more an insurgent who lifted himself above everything that seemed so sublime to the government and its opponents, and absolved himself from everything that they remained bound to [...]; precisely because he put from him the upsetting of the established, he was its deadly enemy and real annihilator[.]|Max Stirner|''The Ego and Its Own'', pp. 280–281}}

As Stirner specifies in a footnote (p.&amp;nbsp;280), he was here using the word [[Insurgency|insurgent]] "in its [[etymological]] sense", therefore to rise above the religion and government of one's own times and to take control of one's life with no consideration of them, but not necessarily to overthrow them. This contrasts with the method of the revolutionary who brings about a change of conditions by displacing one government with another: {{quotation|The revolution aimed at new arrangements; insurrection leads us no longer to let ourselves be arranged, but to arrange ourselves, and sets no glittering hopes on 'institutions'.  It is not a fight against the established [...] it is only a working forth of me out of the established. [...] Now, as my object is not an overthrow of the established order but my elevation above it, my purpose and deed are not political or social but (as directed toward myself and my ownness alone) an egoistic purpose indeed.|Max Stirner|''The Ego and Its Own'', p. 280}}

Stirner was writing about people liberating themselves from their own limits and rising above limiting social, political and ideological conditions and for each to walk their own way. The passages quoted above are clearly incompatible with David Leopold's conclusion (in his introduction to the [[Cambridge University Press]] edition) that Stirner "saw humankind as 'fretted in dark superstition' but denied that he sought their enlightenment and welfare" (''Ibidem'', p. xxxii). Stirner refused to describe himself as directly liberating others, but his stated purpose in these quotations seems to be to achieve the "enlightenment and welfare" of others by way of demonstration and "[[insurrection]]" as he defines it.

=== Dogma ===
The passages quoted above show the few points of contact between Stirner's philosophy and [[early Christianity]]. It is merely Jesus as an "annihilator" of the established biases and preconceptions of Rome that Stirner can relate to. His reason for "citing" the cultural change sparked by Jesus is that he wants the Christian ideologies of 19th century Europe to collapse, much as the ideology of heathen Rome did before it (e.g. "[the Christian era] will end with the casting off of the ideal, with 'contempt for the spirit'", p.&amp;nbsp;320). As with the [[Skepticism|classical skeptics]] before him, Stirner's method of self-liberation is opposed to faith or belief and he envisions a life free from "dogmatic presuppositions" (p.&amp;nbsp;135, 309) or any "fixed standpoint" (p.&amp;nbsp;295). It is not merely Christian [[dogma]] that his thought repudiates, but also a wide variety of European atheist ideologies that are condemned as [[Crypto-Christianity|crypto-Christian]] for putting ideas in an equivalent role: {{quotation|Among many transformations, the Holy Spirit became in time the 'absolute idea' [in Hegelian philosophy], which again in manifold refractions split into the different ideas of philanthropy, reasonableness, civic virtue, and so on. [...] Antiquity, at its close, had gained its ownership of the world only when it had broken the world's overpoweringness and 'divinity', recognised the world's powerlessness and 'vanity'. [...] [The philosophers of our time say] Concepts are to decide everywhere, concepts to regulate life, concepts to rule.  This is the religious world [of our time], to which Hegel gave a systematic expression, bringing method into the nonsense and completing the conceptual precepts into a rounded, firmly-based dogmatic.  Everything is sung according to concepts and the real man, I, am compelled to live according to these conceptual laws. [...] [[Liberalism]] simply replaced [[Christian]] concepts with [[Humanism|humanist]] ones; human instead of divine, political instead of ecclesiastical, 'scientific' instead of doctrinal etc.|Max Stirner|''The Ego and Its Own'', pp. 87–88}}
{{quotation|The thinker is distinguished from the believer only by believing much more than the latter, who, on his part, thinks of much less as signified by his faith (creed). The thinker has a thousand tenets of faith where the believer gets along with few; but the former brings coherence into his tenets, and take the coherence in turn for the scale to estimate their worth by. p. 304}}

What Stirner proposes is not that concepts should rule people, but that people should rule concepts. The "nothingness" of all truth is rooted in the "nothingness" of the self because the ego is the criterion of (dogmatic) truth. Again, Stirner seems closely comparable to the skeptics in that his radical [[epistemology]] directs us to emphasise [[empirical]] experience (the "unmediated" relationship of mind as world and world as mind), but it leaves only a very limited validity to the category of "truth". When we regard the impressions of the senses with detachment, simply for what they are (e.g. neither good nor evil), we may still correctly assign truth to them: {{quotation|Christianity took away from the things of this world only their irresistibleness [...]. In like manner I raise myself above truths and their power: as I am above the sensual, so I am above the truth.  Before me truths are as common and as indifferent as things; they do not carry me away, and do not inspire me with enthusiasm.  There exists not even one truth, not right, not freedom, humanity, etc., that has stability before me, and to which I subject myself. [...] In words and truths [...] there is no salvation for me, as little as there is for the Christian in things and vanities.  As the riches of this world do not make me happy, so neither do its truths. [...] Along with worldly goods, all sacred goods too must be put away as no longer valuable. (p. 307)}}
{{quotation|Truths are material, like vegetables and weeds; as to whether vegetable or weed, the decision lies in me. (p. 313)}}

In place of such systems of beliefs, Stirner presents a detached life of non-dogmatic, open-minded engagement with the world "as it is" (unpolluted by "faith" of any kind, Christian or humanist), coupled with the awareness that there is no soul, no personal essence of any kind, but that the individual's uniqueness consists solely in its "creative nothingness" prior to all concepts.

== Hegel's possible influence ==
Scholar Lawrence Stepelevich argues that [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] was a major influence on ''The Ego and Its Own''. While the latter has an "un-Hegelian structure and tone" on the whole and is hostile to Hegel's conclusions about the self and the world, Stepelevich argues that Stirner's work is best understood as answering Hegel's question of the role of consciousness after it has contemplated "untrue knowledge" and become "absolute knowledge". Stirner, Stepelevich concludes, presents the consequences of the rediscovering one's self-consciousness after realizing self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stepelevich|first1=Lawrence S.|title=Max Stirner as Hegelian|journal=[[Journal of the History of Ideas]]|volume=46|issue=4|pages=597–614|date=1985|doi=10.2307/2709548|issn=0022-5037|jstor=2709548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Widukind De Ridder has argued that scholars who take Stirner's references to Hegel and the [[Young Hegelians]] as expressions of his own alleged [[Hegelianism]] are highly mistaken. De Ridder argues that ''The Ego and Its Own'' is in part a carefully constructed parody of Hegelianism, deliberately exposing its outwornness as a system of thought; and that Stirner's notions of "ownness" and "egoism" were part of his radical criticism of the implicit teleology of Hegelian dialectics.&lt;ref&gt;De Ridder, Widukind, "Max Stirner, Hegel and the Young Hegelians: A reassessment". In: History of European Ideas, 2008, 285–297.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
Stirner was a philosopher whose "name appears with familiar regularity in historically-orientated surveys of anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of individualist anarchism".&lt;ref  name="SEP"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/max-stirner/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry for Max Stirner].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1844, his ''The Ego and Its Own'' (''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum'' which may literally be translated as ''The Unique Individual and His Property'')&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press. p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; was published and it is considered to be "a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism".&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt;

{{Fantasy}}
{{Speculative fiction|cTopic=Fantasy fiction}}

A '''quest''' is a journey toward a specific mission or a goal. The word serves as a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] device in [[mythology]] and [[fiction]]: a difficult [[Travel|journey]] towards a goal, often [[symbol]]ic or [[Allegory|allegorical]].  Tales of quests figure prominently in the [[folklore]] of every nation&lt;ref&gt;Josepha Sherman, ''Once upon a Galaxy'' p 142 {{ISBN|0-87483-387-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic culture]].  In [[literature]], the object of a quest requires great exertion on the part of the [[hero]], who must overcome many obstacles, typically including much travel.  The aspect of travel allows the storyteller to showcase exotic locations and cultures (an objective of the narrative, not of the character).&lt;ref&gt;Michael O. Riley, Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L. Frank Baum, p 178-9, {{ISBN|0-7006-0832-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The object of a quest may also have [[supernatural]] properties, often leading the protagonist into other worlds and dimensions. The [[moral]] of a quest tale often centers on the changed [[Moral character|character]] of the hero.

==Quest objects==

[[Image:TheKnightAtTheCrossroads.jpg|left|thumb|''A Knight at the Crossroads'' by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]]]

The hero normally aims to obtain something or someone by the quest, and with this object to return home.&lt;ref&gt;
[[W. H. Auden]], "The Quest Hero", ''Understanding the Lord of the Rings: The Best of Tolkien Criticism'', p35 {{ISBN|0-618-42253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object can be something new, that fulfills a lack in his life, or something that was stolen away from him or someone with authority to dispatch him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale, p 36, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the hero has no desire to return; Sir [[Galahad]]'s quest for the [[Holy Grail]] is to find it, not return with it. A return may, indeed, be impossible: [[Aeneas]] quests for a homeland, having lost Troy at the beginning of [[Virgil]]'s ''Aeneid,'' and he does not return to Troy to re-found it but settles in Italy (to become an ancestor of the Romans).

If the hero does return after the culmination of the quest, he may face [[false hero]]es who attempt to pass themselves off as him,&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p60, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt; or his initial response may be a rejection of that return, as [[Joseph Campbell]] describes in his critical analysis of quest literature, ''[[The Hero With a Thousand Faces]]''.

If someone dispatches the hero on a quest, the overt reason may be false, with the dispatcher actually sending him on the difficult quest in hopes of his death in the attempt, or in order to remove him from the scene for a time, just as if the claim were sincere, except that the tale usually ends with the dispatcher being unmasked and punished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p77 {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stories with such false quest-objects include the legends of [[Jason]] and [[Perseus]], the fairy tales ''[[The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird]]'', ''[[Go I Know Not Whither and Fetch I Know Not What]]'', and the story of [[Beren and Lúthien]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]''.

The quest object may, indeed, function only as a convenient reason for the hero's journey. Such objects are termed [[MacGuffin]]s. When a hero is on a quest for several objects that are only a convenient reason for his journey, they are termed plot coupons.

==Literary analysis==
The quest, in the form of the [[Monomyth#The Hero's Journey|Hero's Journey]], plays a central role in the [[Monomyth]] described by [[Joseph Campbell]]; the hero sets forth from the world of common day into a land of adventures, tests, and magical rewards.  Most times in a quest, the knight in shining armor wins the heart of a beautiful maiden/ princess.

==Historical examples==
An early quest story tells the tale of [[Gilgamesh]], who seeks a secret to eternal life after the death of [[Enkidu]], including the search for an [[emerald]].

Another ancient quest tale, [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', tells of [[Odysseus]], whom the gods have cursed to wander and suffer for many years before [[Athena]] persuades the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]] to allow him to return home.  Recovering the [[Golden Fleece]] is the object of the travels of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] in the ''[[Argonautica]]''. [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche]], having lost Cupid, hunted through the world for him, and was set tasks by [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], including a descent into the [[underworld]].

Many [[fairy tale]]s depict the hero or heroine setting out on a quest, such as:

* ''[[East of the Sun and West of the Moon]]'' where the heroine seeks her husband
* ''[[The Seven Ravens]]'' where the heroine seeks her transformed brothers
* ''[[The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was]]''
* ''[[The Golden Bird]]'' where the prince sets out to find the golden bird for his father

Other characters may set out with no more definite aim than to "seek their fortune", or even be cast out instead of voluntarily leaving, but learn of something that could aid them along the way and so have their journey transformed from aimless wandering into a quest.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p63, {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other characters can also set forth on quests — the hero's older brothers commonly do — but the hero is distinguished by his success.

[[Image:Galahad grail.jpg|left|360px|thumb|"Vision of the Holy Grail" (1890) by [[William Morris]]]]

Many medieval [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] sent knights out on quests. The term "[[Knight-errant]]" sprang from this, as ''errant'' meant "roving" or "wandering".  Sir [[Thomas Malory]] included many in ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''.  The most famous—perhaps in all of western literature—centers on the [[Holy Grail]] in [[Arthurian legend]].  This [[monomyth|story cycle]] recounts multiple quests, in multiple variants, telling stories both of the heroes who succeed, like [[Percival]] (in [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s [[Parzival]]) or Sir [[Galahad]] (in the [[Queste del Saint Graal]]), and also the heroes who fail, like Sir [[Lancelot]].  This often sent them into a bewildering [[enchanted forest|forest]].  Despite many references to its pathlessness, the forest repeatedly confronts knights with forks and crossroads, of a labyrinthine complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 177, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The significance of their encounters is often explained to the knights—particularly those searching for the [[Holy Grail]]—by [[hermit]]s acting as [[wise old man|wise old men -- or women]].&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 179-81, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Still, despite their perils and chances of error, such forests, being the location where the knight can obtain the end of his quest, are places where the knights may become worthy; one romance has a maiden urging Sir Lancelot on his quest for the Holy Grail, "which quickens with life and greenness like the forest."&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 181, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So consistently did knights quest that [[Miguel de Cervantes]] set his [[Don Quixote]] on mock quests in a parody of chivalric tales. Nevertheless, while Don Quixote was a fool, he was and remains a hero of chivalry.

==Modern literature==
Quests continued in modern literature.  Analysis can interpret many (perhaps most) stories as a quest in which the main character is seeking something that he desires,&lt;ref&gt;Robert McKee, ''Story:  Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting'', p 196-7 {{ISBN|0-06-039168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the literal structure of a journey seeking something is, itself, still common.  Quests often appear in [[fantasy]] literature,&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Quest ", p 796 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in [[Rasselas]] by [[Samuel Johnson]], or ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', where Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion go on a quest for the way back to Kansas, brains, a heart, and courage respectively.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p 126-7, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quests, also, play a major role in [[Rick Riordan]]'s fantasy books, among them ''[[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]]'', ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'', and ''[[The Kane Chronicles]]''.

A familiar modern literary quest is [[Frodo Baggins]]'s quest to destroy the [[One Ring]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. H. Auden]], "The Quest Hero", ''Understanding the Lord of the Rings:  The Best of Tolkien Criticism'', p45 {{ISBN|0-618-42253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The One Ring, its baleful power, the difficult method which is the only way to destroy it, and the spiritual and psychological torture it wreaks on its Bearer; [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] uses all these elements to tell a meaningful tale of [[friendship]] and the inner struggle with [[temptation]], against a background of [[epic poetry|epic]] and supernatural warfare.

''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' is often thought of as a quest plot, detailing Holden's search not for a tangible object but for a sense of purpose or reason.

Some writers, however, may devise arbitrary quests for items without any importance beyond being the object of the quest.  These items are known as [[MacGuffin]]s, which is sometimes merely used to compare quests and is not always a derogatory term.  Writers may also motivate characters to pursue these objects by meanings of a [[Self-fulfilling prophecy#Literature, media, and the arts|prophecy]] that decrees it, rather than have them discover that it could assist them, for reasons that are given.

[[File:Difference DNA RNA-EN.svg|thumb|300px|A comparison of RNA (''left'') with DNA (''right''), showing the helices and [[nucleobase]]s each employs]]

The '''RNA world''' is a hypothetical stage in the [[evolutionary history of life]] on Earth, in which [[self-replicating]] [[RNA]] molecules proliferated before the evolution of [[DNA]] and [[protein]]s.  The term also refers to the hypothesis that posits the existence of this stage.

[[Alexander Rich]] first proposed the concept of the RNA world in 1962,&lt;ref name="Neveu et al"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Neveu M, Kim HJ, Benner SA | title = The "strong" RNA world hypothesis: fifty years old | journal = Astrobiology | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 391–403 | date = Apr 2013 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1089/ast.2012.0868 | pmid = 23551238 | bibcode = 2013AsBio..13..391N |quote= [The RNA world's existence] has broad support within the community today.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Walter Gilbert]] coined the term in 1986.&lt;ref name="Cech2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cech TR | title = The RNA worlds in context | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 4 | issue = 7 | pages = a006742 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 21441585 | pmc = 3385955 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a006742 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative chemical paths to life have been proposed,&lt;ref name="NC-20150316"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Patel BH, Percivalle C, Ritson DJ, Duffy CD, Sutherland JD | title = Common origins of RNA, protein and lipid precursors in a cyanosulfidic protometabolism | journal = Nature Chemistry | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 301–7 | date = Apr 2015 | pmid = 25803468 | pmc = 4568310 | doi = 10.1038/nchem.2202 | url = http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v7/n4/full/nchem.2202.html | bibcode = 2015NatCh...7..301P }}&lt;/ref&gt; and RNA-based life may not have been the first life to exist.&lt;ref name="Cech2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robertson2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robertson MP, Joyce GF | title = The origins of the RNA world | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = a003608 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 20739415 | pmc = 3331698 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a003608 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the evidence for an RNA world is strong enough that the hypothesis has gained wide acceptance.&lt;ref name="Neveu et al" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20150504"&gt;{{cite news |last= Wade |first= Nicholas |authorlink= Nicholas Wade |title= Making Sense of the Chemistry That Led to Life on Earth |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/science/making-sense-of-the-chemistry-that-led-to-life-on-earth.html |date= May 4, 2015 |work= [[The New York Times]] |accessdate= May 10, 2015 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170709115606/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/science/making-sense-of-the-chemistry-that-led-to-life-on-earth.html |archivedate= July 9, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Copley SD, Smith E, Morowitz HJ | title = The origin of the RNA world: co-evolution of genes and metabolism | journal = Bioorganic Chemistry | volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 430–43 | date = Dec 2007 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.bioorg.2007.08.001 | pmid = 17897696 |quote= The proposal that life on Earth arose from an RNA World is widely accepted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like DNA, RNA can store and replicate genetic information; like protein [[enzyme]]s, RNA enzymes ([[ribozyme]]s) can [[catalyze]] (start or accelerate) chemical reactions that are critical for [[life]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20140925-CZ"&gt;{{cite news |last= Zimmer |first= Carl |authorlink= Carl Zimmer |title= A Tiny Emissary from the Ancient Past |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/science/a-tiny-emissary-from-the-ancient-past.html |date= September 25, 2014 |work= [[The New York Times]] |accessdate= September 26, 2014 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140927022738/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/science/a-tiny-emissary-from-the-ancient-past.html |archivedate= September 27, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most critical components of cells, the [[ribosome]], is composed primarily of RNA. Ribonucleotide moieties in many coenzymes, such as [[Acetyl-CoA]], [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]], [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FADH]] and [[Coenzyme F420|F420]], have long been thought of{{by whom?|date=June 2018}} as surviving remnants of covalently bound coenzymes in an RNA world.&lt;ref name='hong'&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Shen |first1= Liang. |last2= Hong-Fang |first2= Ji |title= Small Cofactors May Assist Protein Emergence from RNA World: Clues from RNA-Protein Complexes |pmid= 21789260 |doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0022494 |volume= 6 |issue= 7 |pmc= 3138788 |year= 2011 |journal= PLOS One |page= e22494|bibcode= 2011PLoSO...622494S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although RNA is fragile, some ancient RNAs may have evolved the ability to [[methylate]] other RNAs to protect them.&lt;ref name="Rana"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Rana |first1= Ajay K. |last2= Ankri |first2= Serge |title= Reviving the RNA World: An Insight into the Appearance of RNA Methyltransferases |pmid= 27375676 |doi= 10.3389/fgene.2016.00099 |volume= 7 |pmc= 4893491 |year= 2016 |journal= Front Genet |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the RNA world existed, it was probably followed by an age characterized by the evolution of [[ribonucleoprotein]]s ([[RNP world]]),&lt;ref name="Cech2012"/&gt; which in turn ushered in the era of DNA and longer proteins. DNA has better stability and durability than RNA; this may explain why it became the predominant storage molecule.&lt;ref name="PiP"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Protein enzymes may have come to replace RNA-based ribozymes as [[Biocatalysis|biocatalysts]] because their greater abundance and diversity of [[monomers]] makes them more versatile. As some co-factors contain both nucleotide and amino-acid characteristics, it may be that amino acids, peptides and finally proteins initially were co-factors for ribozymes.&lt;ref name='hong'/&gt;

== History ==
One of the challenges in studying [[abiogenesis]] is that the system of reproduction and metabolism utilized by all extant life involves three distinct types of interdependent macromolecules ([[DNA]], [[RNA]], and [[protein]]). This suggests that life could not have arisen in its current form, which has led researchers to hypothesize mechanisms whereby the current system might have arisen from a simpler precursor system. The concept of RNA as a primordial molecule&lt;ref name= Cech2012 /&gt; can be found in papers by [[Francis Crick]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crick FH | title = The origin of the genetic code | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 367–79 | date = Dec 1968 | pmid = 4887876 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(68)90392-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Leslie Orgel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Orgel LE | title = Evolution of the genetic apparatus | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 381–93 | date = Dec 1968 | pmid = 5718557 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(68)90393-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[Carl Woese]]'s 1967 book ''The Genetic Code''.&lt;ref&gt;Woese C.R. (1967). The genetic code: The molecular basis for genetic expression. p. 186. Harper &amp; Row&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, the molecular biologist [[Alexander Rich]] posited much the same idea in an article he contributed to a volume issued in honor of Nobel-laureate physiologist [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]].&lt;ref name="Atk06"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Atkins | first1 = John F. | last2 = Gesteland | first2 = Raymond F. | last3 = Cech | first3 = Thomas | name-list-format = vanc | title = The RNA world: the nature of modern RNA suggests a prebiotic RNA world |publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press |location=Plainview, N.Y |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-87969-739-3 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans Kuhn]] in 1972 laid out a possible process by which the modern genetic system might have arisen from a nucleotide-based precursor, and this led Harold White in 1976 to observe that many of the cofactors essential for enzymatic function are either nucleotides or could have been derived from nucleotides. He proposed that these nucleotide cofactors represent "fossils of nucleic acid enzymes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = White HB | title = Coenzymes as fossils of an earlier metabolic state | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 101–4 | date = Mar 1976 | pmid = 1263263 | doi = 10.1007/BF01732468 | bibcode = 1976JMolE...7..101W }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "RNA World" was first used by Nobel laureate [[Walter Gilbert]] in 1986, in a commentary on how recent observations of the catalytic properties of various forms of RNA fit with this hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The RNA World|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |first=Walter |last=Gilbert |authorlink=Walter Gilbert |date=February 1986 |pages=618 |volume=319 |doi=10.1038/319618a0 |issue=6055 |bibcode=1986Natur.319..618G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties of RNA ==
The properties of RNA make the idea of the RNA world hypothesis conceptually plausible, though its general acceptance as an explanation for the origin of life requires further evidence.&lt;ref name="Atk06" /&gt; RNA is known to form efficient catalysts and its similarity to DNA makes clear its ability to store information.

{{Further|Ribozyme}}

[[Ribozyme|RNA enzymes]], or ribozymes, are found in today's DNA-based life and could be examples of [[living fossil]]s. Ribozymes play vital roles, such as that of the [[ribosome]], an RNA-protein complex responsible for protein synthesis.

Among the enzymatic properties important for the beginning of life are:
;Self-replication

The shortest was 165-bases long, though it has been estimated that only part of the molecule was crucial for this function.

Each RNA polymerase ribozyme was engineered to remain linked to its new, synthesized RNA strand, this allowed the team to isolate successful polymerases. The isolated RNA polymerases were again used for another round of evolution. After several rounds of evolution, they obtained one RNA polymerase ribozyme called 24-3 that was able to copy almost any other RNA, from small catalysts to long RNA based enzymes. Particular RNAs were amplified up to 10,000 times, a first RNA version of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The RNA polymerase is not yet able to make copies of itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horning|first=David P.|last2=Joyce|first2=Gerald F.|date=2016-08-15|title=Amplification of RNA by an RNA polymerase ribozyme|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/08/10/1610103113|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=113|issue=35|pages=9786–91|doi=10.1073/pnas.1610103113|issn=0027-8424|pmid=27528667|pmc=5024611|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819184015/http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/08/10/1610103113|archivedate=2016-08-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Catalysis
:The ability to [[Catalysis|catalyze]] simple chemical reactions—which would enhance creation of molecules that are building blocks of RNA molecules (i.e., a strand of RNA that would make creating more strands of RNA easier).

If in vitro evolution works for DNA it will happen much more easily with RNA.
;Amino acid-RNA ligation

;Peptide bond formation
:The ability to catalyse the formation of [[peptide bonds]] between amino acids to produce short [[peptide]]s or longer [[protein]]s. This is done in modern cells by ribosomes, a complex of several RNA molecules known as [[rRNA]] together with many proteins.

=== RNA in information storage ===
RNA is a very similar molecule to DNA, with only two major chemical differences (the backbone of RNA uses ribose instead of deoxyribose and its nucleobases include uracil instead of thymine). The overall structure of RNA and DNA are immensely similar—one strand of DNA and one of RNA can bind to form a double helical structure. This makes the storage of information in RNA possible in a very similar way to the storage of information in DNA. However, RNA is less stable, being more prone to hydrolysis due to the presence of a hydroxyl group at the ribose 2' position.

[[File:RNA chemical structure.GIF|thumb|The major difference between RNA and DNA is the presence of a [[hydroxyl]] group at the 2'-position.]]

==== Comparison of DNA and RNA structure ====
{{Main|RNA|DNA}}

The major difference between RNA and DNA is the presence of a [[hydroxyl]] group at the 2'-position of the [[ribose]] sugar in RNA (illustration, right).&lt;ref name="Atk06" /&gt; This group makes the molecule less stable because, when not constrained in a double helix, the 2' hydroxyl can chemically attack the adjacent [[phosphodiester bond]] to cleave the phosphodiester backbone. The hydroxyl group also forces the ribose into the C3'-''endo'' sugar conformation unlike the C2'-''endo'' conformation of the [[deoxyribose]] sugar in DNA. This forces an RNA double helix to change from a [[B-DNA]] structure to one more closely resembling [[A-DNA]].

RNA also uses a different set of bases than DNA—[[adenine]], [[guanine]], [[cytosine]] and [[uracil]], instead of adenine, guanine, cytosine and [[thymine]]. Chemically, uracil is similar to thymine, differing only by a [[methyl group]], and its production requires less energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humpath.com/uracil |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930044720/http://www.humpath.com/uracil |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of base pairing, this has no effect. Adenine readily binds uracil or thymine. Uracil is, however, one product of damage to cytosine that makes RNA particularly susceptible to mutations that can replace a '''GC''' base pair with a '''GU''' ([[wobble base pair|wobble]]) or '''AU''' [[base pair]].

RNA is thought to have preceded DNA, because of their ordering in the biosynthetic pathways. The deoxyribonucleotides used to make DNA are made from ribonucleotides, the building blocks of RNA, by removing the 2'-hydroxyl group. As a consequence a cell must have the ability to make RNA before it can make DNA.

==== Limitations of information storage in RNA ====
The chemical properties of RNA make large RNA [[molecule]]s inherently fragile, and they can easily be broken down into their constituent nucleotides through [[hydrolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lindahl T | title = Instability and decay of the primary structure of DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 362 | issue = 6422 | pages = 709–15 | date = Apr 1993 | pmid = 8469282 | doi = 10.1038/362709a0 | bibcode = 1993Natur.362..709L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ancient DNA|journal=Scientific American|first=S|last=Pääbo|volume=269|pages=60–66|date=November 1993|issue=5|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1193-86|bibcode=1993SciAm.269e..86P}}&lt;/ref&gt; These limitations do not make use of RNA as an information storage system impossible, simply energy intensive (to repair or replace damaged RNA molecules) and prone to mutation. While this makes it unsuitable for current 'DNA optimised' life, it may have been acceptable for more primitive life.

=== RNA as a regulator ===
{{Main|Riboswitch}}
Riboswitches have been found to act as regulators of gene expression, particularly in bacteria, but also in plants and [[archaea]]. Riboswitches alter their [[secondary structure]] in response to the binding of a [[metabolite]]. This change in structure can result in the formation or disruption of a [[Terminator (genetics)|terminator]], truncating or permitting transcription respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nudler E, Mironov AS | title = The riboswitch control of bacterial metabolism | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–7 | date = Jan 2004 | pmid = 14729327 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibs.2003.11.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, riboswitches may bind or occlude the [[Shine-Dalgarno sequence]], affecting translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tucker BJ, Breaker RR | title = Riboswitches as versatile gene control elements | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 342–8 | date = Jun 2005 | pmid = 15919195 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2005.05.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that these originated in an RNA-based world.&lt;ref name="pmid18778966"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bocobza SE, Aharoni A | title = Switching the light on plant riboswitches | journal = Trends Plant Sci. | volume = 13 | issue = 10 | pages = 526–33 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18778966 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2008.07.004 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[RNA thermometer]]s regulate gene expression in response to temperature changes.&lt;ref name="Nar06"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Narberhaus F, Waldminghaus T, Chowdhury S | title = RNA thermometers | journal = FEMS Microbiology Reviews | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–16 | date = Jan 2006 | pmid = 16438677 | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6976.2005.004.x | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0168-6445&amp;date=2006&amp;volume=30&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support and difficulties ==
The RNA world hypothesis is supported by RNA's ability to store, transmit, and duplicate [[genetics|genetic]] information, as [[DNA]] does. RNA can act as a ribozyme, a special type of [[enzyme]]. Because it can perform the tasks of both DNA and enzymes, RNA is believed to have once been capable of supporting independent life forms.&lt;ref name="Atk06" /&gt; Some [[virus]]es use RNA as their genetic material, rather than DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Patton, John T.

Pyrimidine ribonucleosides and their respective nucleotides have been prebiotically synthesised by a sequence of reactions that by-pass free sugars and assemble in a stepwise fashion by including nitrogenous and oxygenous chemistries. In a series of publications, [[John Sutherland (chemist)|John Sutherland]] and his team at the School of Chemistry, [[University of Manchester]], have demonstrated high yielding routes to [[cytidine]] and [[uridine]] ribonucleotides built from small 2 and 3 carbon fragments such as [[glycolaldehyde]], [[glyceraldehyde]] or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, [[cyanamide]] and [[cyanoacetylene]]. One of the steps in this sequence allows the isolation of [[enantiomer|enantiopure]] ribose aminooxazoline if the enantiomeric excess of glyceraldehyde is 60% or greater, of possible interest towards biological homochirality.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Anastasi, Michael A.

Aminooxazolines can react with cyanoacetylene in a mild and highly efficient manner, controlled by inorganic phosphate, to give the cytidine ribonucleotides.

== Prebiotic RNA synthesis ==
Nucleotides are the fundamental molecules that combine in series to form RNA. They consist of a nitrogenous base attached to a sugar-phosphate backbone. RNA is made of long stretches of specific nucleotides arranged so that their sequence of bases carries information. The RNA world hypothesis holds that in the [[primordial soup]] (or [[primordial sandwich|sandwich]]), there existed free-floating nucleotides. These nucleotides regularly formed bonds with one another, which often broke because the change in energy was so low. However, certain sequences of base pairs have catalytic properties that lower the energy of their chain being created, enabling them to stay together for longer periods of time. As each chain grew longer, it attracted more matching nucleotides faster, causing chains to now form faster than they were breaking down.

These chains have been proposed by some as the first, primitive forms of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Villarreal LP, Witzany G | year = 2013 | title = The DNA Habitat and its RNA Inhabitants: At the Dawn of RNA | url = | journal = Sociology | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 1–12 | doi = 10.4137/GEI.S11490 | pmc = 4510605 | pmid=26217106}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an RNA world, different sets of RNA strands would have had different replication outputs, which would have increased or decreased their frequency in the population, i.e. [[natural selection]]. As the fittest sets of RNA molecules expanded their numbers, novel catalytic properties added by mutation, which benefitted their persistence and expansion, could accumulate in the population. Such an [[autocatalytic set]] of ribozymes, capable of self replication in about an hour, has been identified. It was produced by molecular competition ([[Directed evolution|''in vitro'' evolution]]) of candidate enzyme mixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lincoln TA, Joyce GF | title = Self-sustained replication of an RNA enzyme | journal = Science | volume = 323 | issue = 5918 | pages = 1229–32 | date = Feb 2009 | pmid = 19131595 | pmc = 2652413 | doi = 10.1126/science.1167856 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1167856 | publisher = American Association for the Advancement of Science | laydate = January 12, 2009 | laysource = Medical News Today | laysummary = http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/135031.php | bibcode = 2009Sci...323.1229L | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090122203819/http://sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1167856 | archivedate = January 22, 2009 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition between RNA may have favored the emergence of cooperation between different RNA chains, opening the way for the formation of the first [[protocell]]. Eventually, RNA chains developed with catalytic properties that help [[amino acid]]s bind together (a process called [[peptide bond|peptide-bonding]]). These amino acids could then assist with RNA synthesis, giving those RNA chains that could serve as ribozymes the selective advantage. The ability to catalyze one step in protein synthesis, [[Transfer RNA#Aminoacylation|aminoacylation]] of RNA, has been demonstrated in a short (five-nucleotide) segment of RNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Turk RM, Chumachenko NV, Yarus M | title = Multiple translational products from a five-nucleotide ribozyme | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 10 | pages = 4585–9 | date = Mar 2010 | pmid = 20176971 | pmc = 2826339 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0912895107 | laysummary = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/02/100222162009.htm | laydate = February 24, 2010 | laysource = ScienceDaily | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.4585T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyrimidine, like [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), may have been formed in [[Red giant|giant red stars]] or in [[Cosmic dust|interstellar dust]] and gas clouds, according to the scientists.&lt;ref name="NASA-20150303"&gt;{{cite web |last=Marlaire |first=Ruth |name-list-format=vanc |title=NASA Ames Reproduces the Building Blocks of Life in Laboratory |url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-ames-reproduces-the-building-blocks-of-life-in-laboratory |date=3 March 2015 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=5 March 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305083306/http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-ames-reproduces-the-building-blocks-of-life-in-laboratory/ |archivedate=5 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These three molecules are simpler versions of the four bases in current RNA, which could have been present in larger amounts and could still be [[Forward compatibility|forwards compatibile]] with them, but may have been discarded by evolution in exchange for more optimal base pairs.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/new-study-identifies-possible-ancestors-of-rna/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of DNA==
One of the problems with the RNA world hypothesis is to discover the pathway by which RNA became upgraded to the DNA system. Geoffrey Diemer and Ken Stedman, at Portland State University in Oregon, may have found a solution. While conducting a survey of viruses in a hot acidic lake in Lassen Volcanic National Park, California, they uncovered evidence that a simple DNA virus had acquired a gene from a completely unrelated RNA-based virus. Virologist Luis Villareal of the University of California Irvine also suggests that viruses capable of converting an RNA-based gene into DNA and then incorporating it into a more complex DNA-based genome might have been common in the Virus world during the RNA to DNA transition some 4 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Bob (2012) "First Glimpse at the birth of DNA" (New Scientist April 12, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Diemer GS, Stedman KM | title = A novel virus genome discovered in an extreme environment suggests recombination between unrelated groups of RNA and DNA viruses | journal = Biology Direct | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 13 | date = 19 April 2012 | pmid = 22515485 | doi = 10.1186/1745-6150-7-13 | url = http://www.biologydirect.com/content/7/1/13 | access-date = 7 February 2015 | publisher = [[BioMed Central]] | pmc = 3372434 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150207003856/http://www.biologydirect.com/content/7/1/13 | archivedate = 7 February 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding bolsters the argument for the transfer of information from the RNA world to the emerging DNA world before the emergence of the [[last universal common ancestor]]. From the research, the diversity of this virus world is still with us.

== Viroids ==
{{Main|Viroid}}

Additional evidence supporting the concept of an RNA world has resulted from research on [[viroid]]s, the first representatives of a novel domain of "subviral pathogens".&lt;ref name="pmid5095900"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Diener TO | title = Potato spindle tuber "virus".

Viroids are mostly plant pathogens, which consist of short stretches (a few hundred nucleobases) of highly complementary, circular, single-stranded, and non-coding RNA without a protein coat. Compared with other infectious plant pathogens, viroids are extremely small in size, ranging from 246 to 467 nucleobases. In comparison, the genome of the smallest known viruses capable of causing an infection are about 2,000 nucleobases long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanger HL, Klotz G, Riesner D, Gross HJ, Kleinschmidt AK | title = Viroids are single-stranded covalently closed circular RNA molecules existing as highly base-paired rod-like structures | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 73 | issue = 11 | pages = 3852–6 | date = Nov 1976 | pmid = 1069269 | doi=10.1073/pnas.73.11.3852 | pmc=431239| bibcode = 1976PNAS...73.3852S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Diener proposed that, based on their characteristic properties, viroids are more plausible "living relics" of the RNA world than are [[introns]] or other RNAs then so considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Diener TO | year = 1989 | title = Circular RNAs: Relics of precellular evolution? | url = | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA | volume = 86 | issue = 23| pages = 9370–9374 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.86.23.9370 | pmid = 2480600 | pmc=298497| bibcode = 1989PNAS...86.9370D }}&lt;/ref&gt; If so, viroids have attained potential significance beyond plant pathology to evolutionary biology, by representing the most plausible macromolecules known capable of explaining crucial intermediate steps in the evolution of life from inanimate matter (see: [[abiogenesis]]).

Apparently, Diener's hypothesis lay dormant until 2014, when Flores et al. published a review paper, in which Diener's evidence supporting his hypothesis was summarized.&lt;ref name="Flores, R. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flores R, Gago-Zachert S, Serra P, Sanjuan R, Elena SF | year = 2014 | title = Viroids: Survivors from the RNA World? | url = | journal = Annu.

Pertinent viroid properties listed in 1989 are:

# their small size, imposed by error-prone replication;
# their high guanine and cytosine content, which increases stability and replication fidelity;
# their circular structure, which assures complete replication without genomic tags;
# existence of structural periodicity, which permits modular assembly into enlarged genomes;
# their lack of protein-coding ability, consistent with a ribosome-free habitat; and
# replication mediated in some by ribozymes—the fingerprint of the RNA world.&lt;ref name="Flores, R. 2014" /&gt;

The existence, in extant cells, of RNAs with molecular properties predicted for RNAs of the RNA World constitutes an additional argument supporting the RNA World hypothesis.

A protocell that was haploid (one copy of each RNA gene) would be vulnerable to damage, since a single lesion in any RNA segment would be potentially lethal to the protocell (e.g. by blocking replication or inhibiting the function of an essential gene).

Vulnerability to damage could be reduced by maintaining two or more copies of each RNA segment in each protocell, i.e. by maintaining diploidy or polyploidy. Genome redundancy would allow a damaged RNA segment to be replaced by an additional replication of its homolog. However, for such a simple organism, the proportion of available resources tied up in the genetic material would be a large fraction of the total resource budget. Under limited resource conditions, the protocell reproductive rate would likely be inversely related to ploidy number. The protocell's fitness would be reduced by the costs of redundancy. Consequently, coping with damaged RNA genes while minimizing the costs of redundancy would likely have been a fundamental problem for early protocells.

A cost-benefit analysis was carried out in which the costs of maintaining redundancy were balanced against the costs of genome damage.&lt;ref name=Bernstein84&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernstein H, Byerly HC, Hopf FA, Michod RE | title = Origin of sex | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 110 | issue = 3 | pages = 323–51 | date = Oct 1984 | pmid = 6209512 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-5193(84)80178-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis led to the conclusion that, under a wide range of circumstances, the selected strategy would be for each protocell to be haploid, but to periodically fuse with another haploid protocell to form a transient diploid. The retention of the haploid state maximizes the growth rate. The periodic fusions permit mutual reactivation of otherwise lethally damaged protocells. If at least one damage-free copy of each RNA gene is present in the transient diploid, viable progeny can be formed. For two, rather than one, viable daughter cells to be produced would require an extra replication of the intact RNA gene homologous to any RNA gene that had been damaged prior to the division of the fused protocell. The cycle of haploid reproduction, with occasional fusion to a transient diploid state, followed by splitting to the haploid state, can be considered to be the sexual cycle in its most primitive form.&lt;ref name=Bernstein84 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = Carol | last2 = Bernstein | first2 = Harris | name-list-format = vanc | title = Aging, sex, and DNA repair |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=1991 |pages= |isbn=0-12-092860-4 |oclc= |doi= }} see pgs. 293-297&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of this sexual cycle, haploid protocells with damage in an essential RNA gene would simply die.

This model for the early sexual cycle is hypothetical, but it is very similar to the known sexual behavior of the segmented RNA viruses, which are among the simplest organisms known. [[Orthomyxoviridae|Influenza virus]], whose genome consists of 8 physically separated single-stranded RNA segments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lamb RA, Choppin PW | title = The gene structure and replication of influenza virus | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 52 | issue =  | pages = 467–506 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6351727 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.52.070183.002343 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of this type of virus. In segmented RNA viruses, "mating" can occur when a host cell is infected by at least two virus particles. If these viruses each contain an RNA segment with a lethal damage, multiple infection can lead to reactivation providing that at least one undamaged copy of each virus gene is present in the infected cell. This phenomenon is known as "multiplicity reactivation".

Through the process of viral infection into hosts the three domains of life evolved.&lt;ref name=3V3D&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1450140 | pmid=16505372 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0510333103 | volume=103 | issue=10 | title=Three RNA cells for ribosomal lineages and three DNA viruses to replicate their genomes: a hypothesis for the origin of cellular domain | date=March 2006 | journal=Proc.

[[Steven Benner]] has argued that chemical conditions on the planet [[Mars]], such as the presence of [[boron]], [[molybdenum]] and [[oxygen]], may have been better for initially producing RNA molecules than those on [[Earth]].

== Alternative hypotheses ==

The hypothesized existence of an RNA world does not exclude a "Pre-RNA world", where a metabolic system based on a different nucleic acid is proposed to pre-date RNA. A candidate nucleic acid is peptide nucleic acid ([[Peptide nucleic acid|PNA]]), which uses simple [[peptide bond]]s to link nucleobases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Egholm M, Buchardt O, Christensen L, Behrens C, Freier SM, Driver DA, Berg RH, Kim SK, Norden B, Nielsen PE | title = PNA hybridizes to complementary oligonucleotides obeying the Watson-Crick hydrogen-bonding rules | journal = Nature | volume = 365 | issue = 6446 | pages = 566–8 | date = Oct 1993 | pmid = 7692304 | doi = 10.1038/365566a0 | bibcode = 1993Natur.365..566E | url = http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/pna-hybridizes-to-complementary-oligonucleotides-obeying-the-watsoncrick-hydrogenbonding-rules(e4e4fdf9-920e-48b0-a3fa-86129ffff0b8).html | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171117142659/http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/pna-hybridizes-to-complementary-oligonucleotides-obeying-the-watsoncrick-hydrogenbonding-rules(e4e4fdf9-920e-48b0-a3fa-86129ffff0b8).html | archivedate = 2017-11-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; PNA is more stable than RNA, but its ability to be generated under prebiological conditions has yet to be demonstrated experimentally.

Threose nucleic acid ([[TNA (nucleic acid)|TNA]]) has also been proposed as a starting point, as has glycol nucleic acid ([[GNA (nucleic acid)|GNA]]), and like PNA, also lack experimental evidence for their respective abiogenesis.

An alternative — or complementary — theory of RNA origin is proposed in the [[PAH world hypothesis]], whereby [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s ([[PAHs]]) mediate the synthesis of RNA molecules.&lt;ref&gt;Platts, Simon Nicholas, [http://www.pahworld.com/ "The PAH World – Discotic polynuclear aromatic compounds as a mesophase scaffolding at the origin of life"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203045451/http://pahworld.com/ |date=2011-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PAHs are the most common and abundant of the known polyatomic molecules in the visible [[Universe]], and are a likely constituent of the [[primordial sea]].&lt;ref name=ames&gt;Allamandola, Louis et Al.

E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[iron-sulfur world theory]] proposes that simple metabolic processes developed before genetic materials did, and these energy-producing cycles catalyzed the production of genes.

Some of the difficulties of producing the precursors on earth are bypassed by another alternative or complementary theory for their origin, [[panspermia]]. It discusses the possibility that the earliest life on this planet was carried here from somewhere else in the galaxy, possibly on meteorites similar to the [[Murchison meteorite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernstein MP, Sandford SA, Allamandola LJ, Gillette JS, Clemett SJ, Zare RN | title = UV irradiation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in ices: production of alcohols, quinones, and ethers | journal = Science | volume = 283 | issue = 5405 | pages = 1135–8 | date = Feb 1999 | pmid = 10024233 | doi = 10.1126/science.283.5405.1135 | bibcode = 1999Sci...283.1135B }}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not invalidate the concept of an RNA world, but posits that this world or its precursors originated not on Earth but rather another, probably older, planet.

There are hypotheses that are in direct conflict to the RNA world hypothesis. The relative chemical complexity of the nucleotide and the unlikelihood of it spontaneously arising, along with the limited number of combinations possible among four base forms, as well as the need for RNA polymers of some length before seeing enzymatic activity, have led some to reject the RNA world hypothesis in favor of a metabolism-first hypothesis, where the chemistry underlying cellular function arose first, along with the ability to replicate and facilitate this metabolism.

=== RNA-peptide coevolution ===

Another proposal is that the dual-molecule system we see today, where a nucleotide-based molecule is needed to synthesize protein, and a peptide-based (protein) molecule is needed to make nucleic acid polymers, represents the original form of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kunin V | title = A system of two polymerases--a model for the origin of life | journal = Origins of Life and Evolution of the Biosphere | volume = 30 | issue = 5 | pages = 459–66 | date = Oct 2000 | pmid = 11002892 | doi = 10.1023/A:1006672126867 | bibcode = 2000OLEB...30..459K }}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is called RNA-peptide coevolution,&lt;ref name="pascal"&gt;{{Citation | last = Pascal| first = Robert | contribution = A scenario starting from the first chemical building blocks| year = 2007 | title = From Suns to Life: A Chronological Approach to the History of Life on Earth | editor-last = Reisse | editor-first = Jacques | pages = 163–166 | publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media | isbn = 0-387-45083-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Peptide-RNA world, and offers a possible explanation for the rapid evolution of high-quality replication in RNA (since proteins are catalysts), with the disadvantage of having to postulate the coincident formation of two complex molecules, an enzyme (from peptides) and a RNA (from nucleotides).

== Implications of the RNA world ==
The RNA world hypothesis, if true, has important implications for the [[definition of life]]. For most of the time that followed [[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]]'s elucidation of DNA structure in 1953, life was largely defined in terms of DNA and proteins: DNA and proteins seemed the dominant macromolecules in the living cell, with RNA only aiding in creating proteins from the DNA blueprint.

The RNA world hypothesis places RNA at center-stage when life originated. The RNA world hypothesis is supported by the observations that ribosomes are ribozymes: the catalytic site is composed of RNA, and proteins hold no major structural role and are of peripheral functional importance. This was confirmed with the deciphering of the 3-dimensional structure of the ribosome in 2001. Specifically, peptide bond formation, the reaction that binds [[amino acid]]s together into [[protein]]s, is now known to be catalyzed by an adenine residue in the [[rRNA]].

RNAs are known to play roles in other cellular catalytic processes, specifically in the targeting of enzymes to specific RNA sequences.  In eukaryotes, the processing of [[pre-mRNA]] and [[RNA editing]] take place at sites determined by the base pairing between the target RNA and RNA constituents of [[snRNP|small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs)]].  Such enzyme targeting is also responsible for gene down regulation though [[RNA interference]] (RNAi), where an enzyme-associated guide RNA targets specific mRNA for selective destruction.  Likewise, in eukaryotes the maintenance of [[telomeres]] involves copying of an RNA template that is a constituent part of the [[telomerase]] ribonucleoprotein enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12304-008-9018-0|title=The Viral Origins of Telomeres and Telomerases and their Important Role in Eukaryogenesis and Genome Maintenance|journal=Biosemiotics|volume=1|issue=2|pages=191–206|year=2008|last1=Witzany|first1=Guenther | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another cellular organelle, the [[Vault (organelle)|vault]], includes a ribonucleoprotein component, although the function of this organelle remains to be elucidated.

In the 1960s, sociologist John McKnight coined the term "redlining" to describe the discriminatory practice of fencing off areas where banks would avoid investments based on community demographics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultural Geography: Environments, Landscapes, Identities, Inequalities|last=Norton|first=William|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=0195429540|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the heyday of redlining, the areas most frequently discriminated against were black [[inner city]] neighborhoods. For example, in [[Atlanta]] in the 1980s, a [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning series of articles by investigative reporter [[Bill Dedman]] showed that banks would often lend to lower-income whites but not to middle-income or upper-income blacks.&lt;ref name="Color of Money"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://powerreporting.com/color/|title=The Color of Money |last=Dedman |first=Bill |date=1988-05-01 |publisher=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[blacklist]]s is a related mechanism also used by redliners to keep track of groups, areas, and people that the discriminating party feels should be denied business or aid or other transactions. In the academic literature, redlining falls under the broader category of [[credit rationing]].

== History ==
{{Segregation}}
Although informal discrimination and segregation had existed in the United States, the specific practice called "redlining" began with the [[National Housing Act of 1934]], which established the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA).&lt;ref name = "jackson"/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/the-racist-housing-policy-that-made-your-neighborhood/371439/|title=The Racist Housing Policy That Made Your Neighborhood|last=Madrigal|first=Alexis C.|date=2014-05-22|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Racial segregation and discrimination against minorities and minority communities pre-existed this policy.  The implementation of this federal policy aggravated the decay of minority inner-city neighborhoods caused by the withholding of mortgage capital, and made it even more difficult for neighborhoods to attract and retain families able to purchase homes.&lt;ref name = "wilson"/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}} The assumptions in redlining resulted in a large increase in residential [[racial segregation]] and [[urban decay]] in the United States.

In 1935, the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]] (FHLBB) asked [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation]] (HOLC) to look at 239 cities and create "residential security maps" to indicate the level of security for real-estate investments in each surveyed city.  On the maps, the newest areas—those considered desirable for lending purposes—were outlined in green and known as "Type A". These were typically affluent suburbs on the outskirts of cities. "Type B" neighborhoods, outlined in blue, were considered "Still Desirable", whereas older "Type C" were labeled "Declining" and outlined in yellow.
"Type D" neighborhoods were outlined in red and were considered the most risky for mortgage support. These neighborhoods tended to be the older districts in the center of cities; often they were also [[black neighborhoods]].&lt;ref name="jackson"&gt;{{cite crabgrass}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}} Urban planning historians theorize that the maps were used by private and public entities for years afterward to deny loans to people in black communities.&lt;ref name = "jackson"/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}} But, recent research has indicated that the HOLC did not redline in its own lending activities and that the racist language reflected the bias of the private sector and experts hired to conduct the appraisals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cplan_papers/3/|title=Redlining and the Homeowners' Loan Corporation|author=Hillier, Amy E.|date=2003-05-01|accessdate=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bellwether.metapress.com/content/h128812346540080/ Crossney and Bartelt 2005 Urban Geography]  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120709153741/http://bellwether.metapress.com/content/h128812346540080/ |date=2012-07-09 }}[http://www.mi.vt.edu/data/files/hpd%20vol.16%20issues%203%20and%204/articles/hpd6(3,4)%20crossney.pdf Crossney and Bartelt 2006 Housing Policy Debate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414023817/http://www.mi.vt.edu/data/files/hpd%20vol.16%20issues%203%20and%204/articles/hpd6(3,4)%20crossney.pdf |date=2008-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some redlined maps were also created by private organizations, such as J.M. Brewer's 1934 map of Philadelphia.  Private organizations created maps designed to meet the requirements of the [[Federal Housing Administration]]'s underwriting manual. The lenders had to consider FHA standards if they wanted to receive FHA insurance for their loans. FHA appraisal manuals instructed banks to steer clear of areas with "inharmonious racial groups", and recommended that municipalities enact racially restrictive zoning ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;''Principles to Guide Housing Policy at the Beginning of the Millennium'', Michael Schill &amp; Susan Wachter, [[Cityscape]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url=http://wbhsi.net/~wendyplotkin/DeedsWeb/fha38.html |quote=Recommended restrictions should include provision for the following: Prohibition of the occupancy of properties '''except by the race for which they are intended''' ...Schools should be appropriate to the needs of the new community and they should not be attended in large numbers by '''inharmonious racial groups''' | publisher=[[Federal Housing Administration]] | title=Underwriting Manual: Underwriting and Valuation Procedure Under Title II of the [[National Housing Act of 1934|National Housing Act]] With Revisions to February 1938 | location=Washington, D.C. | chapter=Part II, Section 9, Rating of Location}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a [[National Housing Conference]] in 1973, a group of Chicago community organizations led by The Northwest Community Organization (NCO) formed [[National People's Action]] (NPA), to broaden the fight against disinvestment and mortgage redlining in neighborhoods all over the country. This organization, led by Chicago housewife [[Gale Cincotta]] and [[Shel Trapp]], a professional community organizer, targeted The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the governing authority over federally chartered Savings &amp; Loan institutions (S&amp;L) that held at that time the bulk of the country's home mortgages. NPA embarked on an effort to build a national coalition of urban community organizations to pass a national disclosure regulation or law to require banks to reveal their lending patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hallahan|first=Kirk|title=THE MORTGAGE REDLINING CONTROVERSY, 1972–1975|url=http://lamar.colostate.edu/~pr/redlining.pdf|publisher=Qualitative Studies Division, Association in Journalism and Mass Communication, Montreal August 1992|accessdate=12 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809022759/http://lamar.colostate.edu/~pr/redlining.pdf|archivedate=9 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, urban community organizations had battled neighborhood decay by attacking [[blockbusting]], forcing landlords to maintain properties, and requiring cities to board up and tear down abandoned properties. These actions addressed the short-term issues of neighborhood decline. Neighborhood leaders began to learn that these issues and conditions were symptoms of a disinvestment that was the true, though hidden, underlying cause of these problems. They changed their strategy as more data was gathered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Michael, Westgate and Ann, Vick-Westgate|title=Gale Force, The Battles for Disclosure and Community Reinvestment|year=2011|publisher=Harvard Bookstore|location=Cambridge, Ma.|isbn=978-0615449012|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the help of NPA, a coalition of loosely affiliated community organizations began to form. At the Third Annual Housing Conference held in Chicago in 1974, eight hundred delegates representing 25 states and 35 cities attended. The strategy focused on the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB), which oversaw S&amp;L's in cities all over the country.

In 1974, Chicago's Metropolitan Area Housing Association (MAHA), made up of representatives of local organizations, succeeded in having the Illinois State Legislature pass laws mandating disclosure and outlawing redlining. In Massachusetts, organizers allied with NPA confronted a unique situation. Over 90% of home mortgages were held by state-chartered savings banks. A Jamaica Plain neighborhood organization pushed the disinvestment issue into the statewide gubernatorial race. The Jamaica Plain Banking &amp; Mortgage Committee and its citywide affiliate, The Boston Anti-redlining Coalition (BARC), won a commitment from Democratic candidate [[Michael S. Dukakis]] to order statewide disclosure through the Massachusetts State Banking Commission. After Dukakis was elected, his new Banking Commissioner ordered banks to disclose mortgage-lending patterns by ZIP code. The suspected redlining was revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jordan|first=Patricia|title=Mass Thrifts Plan Suit Over Redlining, Commissioner Stands Firm|journal=American Banker|date=June 12, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NPA and its affiliates achieved disclosure of lending practices with the passage of The [[Home Mortgage Disclosure Act]] of 1975. The required transparency and review of loan practices began to change lending practices. NPA began to work on reinvestment in areas that had been neglected. Their support helped gain passage in 1977 of the [[Community Reinvestment Act]].

According to blackpast.org contributor Brent Gaspaire:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Redlining (1937-   ) {{!}} The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed|url = http://www.blackpast.org/aah/redlining-1937|website = www.blackpast.org|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=As a consequence of redlining, neighborhoods that local banks deemed unfit for investment were left underdeveloped or in disrepair.  Attempts to improve these neighborhoods with even relatively small-scale business ventures were commonly obstructed by financial institutions that continued to label the underwriting as too risky or simply rejected them outright.  When existing businesses collapsed, new ones were not allowed to replace them, often leaving entire blocks empty and crumbling. Consequently, African Americans in those neighborhoods were frequently limited in their access to banking, healthcare, retail merchandise, and even groceries.|sign=|source=}}

Redlining paralyzed the housing market, lowered property values in certain areas and encouraged landlord [[Abandonment (legal)|abandonment]]. As abandonment increased, the population density became lower. Abandoned buildings served as havens for drug dealing and other illegal activity, increasing social problems and reluctance of people to invest in these areas.&lt;ref name = "wilson"/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}}
Because areas were redlined residents in them were unable to obtain loans to improve their homes or get loans to move to a different area. Obviously, the neighborhoods had zero investment while neighborhoods around them improved. When the GI Bill was created during World War II, veterans who once lived in redlined areas were unable to get zero interest loans to build new homes like the rest of the returning soldiers. This forced them to stay in the areas that were poor and uninvested in while the rest of America was growing and moving to the suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sprawling of America.'' Dir. [[Wade Goodwyn]] and Christopher M. Cook. Great Lakes Television Consortium, 2011. Great Lakes Television Consortium. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time the GI Bill was created, the Federal Highway Act was also created. Because the areas that were redlined were so poor, many cities chose to destroy these areas to create the highways. The residents were displaced and forced to move into different uninvested neighborhoods while their homes and businesses were destroyed by the highways.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue, Thomas, and Eric Foner.

A 2017 study by Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago economists found that the practice of redlining—the practice whereby banks discriminated against the inhabitants of certain neighborhoods—had a persistent adverse impact on the neighborhoods, with redlining affecting homeownership rates, home values and credit scores in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2017/wp2017-12|title=The Effects of the 1930s HOLC "Redlining" Maps - Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|website=www.chicagofed.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/upshot/how-redlinings-racist-effects-lasted-for-decades.html|title=How Redlining's Racist Effects Lasted for Decades|last=Badger|first=Emily|date=2017-08-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-26|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since many African-Americans could not access conventional home loans, they had to turn to predatory lenders (who charged high interest rates).&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Due to lower home ownership rates, slumlords were able to rent out apartments that would otherwise be owned.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

=== Legislative action ===
In the United States, the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]] was passed to fight the practice. According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development "The ''Fair Housing Act'' makes it unlawful to discriminate in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale of a dwelling because of race or national origin. The Act also makes it unlawful for any person or other entity whose business includes residential real estate-related transactions to discriminate against any person in making available such a transaction, or in the terms or conditions of such a transaction, because of race or national origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = HUDNo_15-064|url = http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/press/press_releases_media_advisories/2015/HUDNo_15-064b|website = portal.hud.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-04|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150905061813/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fpress%2Fpress_releases_media_advisories%2F2015%2FHUDNo_15-064b|archivedate = 2015-09-05|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] was tasked with administering and enforcing this law.

In the mid-1970s, community organizations,  under the banner of the NPA,  worked to fight against redlining in South Austin, Illinois. One of these organisations was SACCC ([[South Austin Coalition Community Council]]), formed to restore South Austin's neighbourhood and to fight against financial institutions accused of propagating redlining. This got the attention of insurance regulators in the Illinois Department of Insurance,  as well as federal officers enforcing anti-racial discrimination laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1981/02/14/page/S8/article/combatting-redlining-in-austin|title=Combatting redlining in Austin (February 14, 1981)|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current issues==

=== Retail ===

==== Brick and mortar ====
[[Retail]] redlining is a spatially discriminatory practice among retailers. Taxicab services and delivery food may not serve certain areas, based on their ethnic-minority composition and assumptions about business (and perceived crime), rather than data and economic criteria, such as the potential profitability of operating in those areas. Consequently, consumers in these areas are vulnerable to prices set by fewer retailers. They may be exploited by retailers who charge higher prices and/or offer them inferior goods.&lt;ref&gt;Denver D'Rozario, "Retail Redlining: Definition, Theory, Typology, and Measurement", ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 25, No. 2, 175–186 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Online ====

A 2012 study by the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' found that [[Staples Inc.|Staples]], [[Home Depot]], [[Rosetta Stone (software)|Rosetta Stone]] and some other online retailers displayed different prices to customers in different locations (distinct from shipping prices).  Staples based discounts on proximity to competitors like [[OfficeMax]] and [[Office Depot]].  This generally resulted in higher prices for customers in more rural areas, who were on average less wealthy than customers seeing lower prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323777204578189391813881534 |publisher=''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' |authors=Jennifer Valentino-DeVries, Jeremy Singer-Vine, Ashkan Soltani |date=24 Dec 2012 |title= Websites Vary Prices, Deals Based on Users' Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Liquorlining ====
Some service providers target low-income neighborhoods for nuisance sales. When those services are believed to have adverse effects on a community, they may considered to be a form of "reverse redlining."  The term "liquorlining" is sometimes used to describe high densities of liquor stores in low income and/or minority communities relative to surrounding areas. High densities of liquor stores are associated with crime and public health issues, which may in turn drive away supermarkets, grocery stores, and other retail outlets, contributing to low levels of economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://woodstockinst.org/document/liquorlining.pdf |title=Liquorlining: Liquor Store Concentration and Community Development in Lower-income Cook County Neighborhoods |last1=Maxwell |first1=Ann |last2=Daniel |first2=Immergluck |date=January 1997 |website=Woodstock Institute |format=PDF |access-date=14 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416121921/http://woodstockinst.org/document/liquorlining.pdf |archivedate=16 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Controlled for income, nonwhites face higher concentrations of liquor stores than do whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Romley |first1=John A. |last2=Cohen |first2=Deborah |last3=Ringel |first3=Jeanne |last4=Sturm |first4=Roland |display-authors=2 |last-author-amp= |editor-last=Schuckit |editor1-first=Mark A. |date=January 2007 |title=Alcohol and Environmental Justice:The Density of Liquor Stores and Bars in Urban Neighborhoods in the United States |url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/reprints/2008/RAND_RP1323.pdf |format=PDF |journal=''[[Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs]]'' |location= |publisher=Alcohol Research Documentation |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=48–55  |access-date=14 March 2015 |via=[[RAND Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case alleged that the factors Sallie Mae used to [[Underwriting|underwrite]] [[private student loans]] caused a [[disparate impact]] on students attending schools with higher minority populations. The suit also alleged that Sallie Mae failed to properly disclose loan terms to private student loan borrowers.

The lawsuit was settled in 2011. The terms of the settlement included Sallie Mae agreeing to make a $500,000 donation to the [[United Negro College Fund]] and the attorneys for the plaintiffs receiving $1.8 million in attorneys' fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ecf.ctd.uscourts.gov/doc1/04113074545 |title=SDSD District Version 1.3 |publisher=United States District Court for the District of Connecticut |date= |accessdate=July 25, 2014}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Credit cards ====
[[Credit card]] redlining is a spatially discriminatory practice among credit card issuers, of providing different amounts of [[Credit score in the United States|credit]] to different areas, based on their ethnic-minority composition, rather than on economic criteria, such as the potential profitability of operating in those areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1098403 |title=Credit Card Redlining |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |year=2009 |last1=Cohen-Cole |first1=Ethan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars assess certain policies, such as credit card issuers reducing credit lines of individuals with a record of purchases at retailers frequented by so-called "high-risk" customers, to be akin to redlining.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==== Insurance ====
Gregory D. Squires wrote in 2003 that data showed that race continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry.&lt;ref name=Squires2016&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-9906.t01-1-00168 |title=Racial Profiling, Insurance Style: Insurance Redlining and the Uneven Development of Metropolitan Areas |journal=Journal of Urban Affairs |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=391–410 |year=2016 |last1=Squires |first1=Gregory D }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Racial profiling]] or redlining has a long history in the property-insurance industry in the United States. From a review of industry underwriting and marketing materials, court documents, and research by government agencies, industry and community groups, and academics, it is clear that race has long affected and continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry.&lt;ref name=Squires2016/&gt; Home-insurance agents may try to assess the ethnicity of a potential customer just by telephone, affecting what services they offer to inquiries about purchasing a home insurance policy. This type of discrimination is called [[Linguistic Profiling|linguistic profiling]].&lt;ref name=SquiresChadwick2006&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1078087405281064 |title=Linguistic Profiling |journal=Urban Affairs Review |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=400–15 |year=2016 |last1=Squires |first1=Gregory D |last2=Chadwick |first2=Jan }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been concerns raised about redlining in the [[car insurance|automotive insurance]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itd.idaho.gov/transporter/2003/080803_Trans/080803_MIuninsured.html Karen Bouffard, "Michigan to crack down on uninsured drivers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128033237/http://www.itd.idaho.gov/transporter/2003/080803_Trans/080803_MIuninsured.html |date=2007-11-28 }}, ''[[The Detroit News]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews of [[insurance score]]s based on credit are shown to have unequal results by ethnic group. The Ohio Department of Insurance in the early 21st century allows insurance providers to use maps and collection of demographic data by ZIP code in determining insurance rates. The FHEO Director of Investigations at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Sara Pratt, wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like other forms of discrimination, the history of insurance redlining began in conscious, overt racial discrimination practiced openly and with significant community support in communities throughout the country. There was documented overt discrimination in practices relating to residential housing—from the appraisal manuals which established an articulated "policy" of preferences based on race, religion and national origin. to lending practices which only made loans available in certain parts of town or to certain borrowers, to the decision-making process in loans and insurance which allowed the insertion of discriminatory assessments into final decisions about either.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fairhousing.com/resources/history-insurance-redlining|title=The History of Insurance Redlining {{!}} National Fair Housing Advocate Online|website=fairhousing.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Mortgages ====
'''Reverse redlining''' occurs when a lender or insurer particularly targets minority consumers, not to deny them loans or insurance, but to charge them more than would be charged to a similarly situated white consumer, specifically marketing the most expensive and onerous loan products. These communities had [[Mortgage discrimination|largely been ignored by most lenders]] just a couple of decades earlier. In the 2000s some financial institutions considered black communities as suitable for subprime mortgages. [[Wells Fargo]] partnered with churches in black communities, where the pastor would deliver "wealth building" seminars in their sermons, and the bank would make a donation to the church in return for every new mortgage application. Working-class blacks wanted a part of the nation's home-owning trend. Instead of contributing to homeownership and community progress, predatory lending practices through reverse redlining stripped the equity homeowners struggled to build and drained the wealth of those communities for the enrichment of [[Financial institution|financial firms]]. The growth of [[subprime lending]] (higher cost loans to borrowers with flaws on their credit records) prior to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 financial crisis]], coupled with growing law enforcement activity in those areas, clearly showed a surge in a range of manipulative practices. Not all subprime loans were predatory, but virtually all [[Predatory lending|predatory loans]] were subprime. Some subprime loans certainly benefit high-risk borrowers who would not qualify for conventional, [[prime loan]]s. Predatory loans, however, charge unreasonably higher rates and fees by compared to the risk, trapping homeowners in unaffordable debt and often costing them their homes and life savings.&lt;ref name="The Recession's Racial Divide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell"/&gt;

A survey of two districts of similar incomes, one being largely white and the other largely black, found that bank branches in the black community offered largely subprime loans and almost no prime loans. Studies found out that high-income blacks were almost twice as likely to end up with subprime home-purchase mortgages as did low-income whites. Some loan officers referred to blacks as "mud people" and to subprime lending as "ghetto loans."&lt;ref name="The Recession's Racial Divide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/minority-families-face-wave-of-foreclosures |title=Minority families face wave of foreclosures: Consumer groups urge more 'teeth' in laws combating predators |first=Ruth |last=Mantell |date=July 6, 2007 |accessdate=December 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lower savings rate and a distrust of banks, stemming from a legacy of redlining, may help explain why there are fewer branches in minority neighborhoods. In the early 21st century, brokers and telemarketers actively pushed subprime mortgages. A majority of the loans were refinance transactions, allowing homeowners to take cash out of their appreciating property or pay off credit card and other debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/weekinreview/04bajaj.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Vikas | last1=Bajaj | first2=Ford | last2=Fessenden | title=What's Behind the Race Gap? |date=November 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redlining has helped preserve [[Housing segregation in the United States|segregated]] living patterns for blacks and whites in the United States, as discrimination is often contingent on the racial composition of neighborhoods and the race of the applicant. Lending institutions such as [[Wells Fargo]] have been shown to treat black mortgage applicants differently when they are buying homes in white neighborhoods than when buying homes in black neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="The Recession's Racial Divide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen R Holloway (1998), "Exploring the Neighborhood Contingency of Race Discrimination in Mortgage Lending in Columbus, Ohio", ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', 88 (2), 252–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan Immergluck writes that in 2002 small businesses in black neighborhoods received fewer loans, even after accounting for business density, business size, industrial mix, neighborhood income, and the credit quality of local businesses.&lt;ref&gt;"Redlining Redux", ''Urban Affairs Review,'' Vol. 38, No. 1, 22–41 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Several state attorneys general have begun investigating these practices, which may violate fair lending laws. The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] filed a class-action lawsuit charging systematic racial discrimination by more than a dozen banks.

=== Environmental racism ===
{{Main|Environmental racism}}
{{See also|Race and health}}
Policies related to redlining and [[urban decay]] can also act as a form of [[environmental racism]], which in turn affect public health. Urban minority communities may face environmental racism in the form of parks that are smaller, less accessible and of poorer quality than those in more affluent or white areas in some cities.&lt;ref name="parks"&gt;''[http://www.berkeleydaily.org/text/article.cfm?issue=11-13-07&amp;storyID=28458 Minority Communities Need More Parks, Report Says]'' by Angela Rowen ''The Berkeley Daily Planet''&lt;/ref&gt; This may have an indirect effect on health, since young people have fewer places to play, and adults have fewer opportunities for exercise.&lt;ref name="parks" /&gt;

Robert Wallace writes that the pattern of the [[AIDS]] outbreak during the 80s was affected by the outcomes of a program of "[[planned shrinkage]]" directed at African-American and Hispanic communities. It was implemented through systematic denial of municipal services, particularly fire protection resources, essential to maintain urban levels of population density and ensure community stability.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, R. "Urban desertification, public health and public order: 'planned shrinkage', violent death, substance abuse and AIDS in the Bronx." ''Soc Sci Med,'' 1990 – ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/ref&gt; [[Institutionalized racism]] affects general health care as well as the quality of AIDS health intervention and services in minority communities. The over-representation of minorities in various disease categories, including AIDS, is partially related to environmental racism. The national response to the AIDS epidemic in minority communities was slow during the 80s and 90s, showing an insensitivity to ethnic diversity in prevention efforts and AIDS health services.&lt;ref&gt;"AIDS and racism in America." Hutchinson J., ''Journal of the National Medical Association,'' 1992 Feb;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Combating redlining ==
'''Fair Housing Act'''

The Fair Housing Act (also known as the Civil Rights Act) of 1968 was passed in order to help protect minority individuals from the discriminatory practices of financial institutions and agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/progdesc/title8|title=HUD.gov / U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)|website=www.hud.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-09-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928145907/https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/progdesc/title8#|archive-date=2017-09-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guidelines'''

The Human Relations Commissions of Pennsylvania adopted guidelines regarding redlining. The guidelines demonstrate practices that are to be prohibited in the selling of property to people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phrc.pa.gov/Resources/Law-and-Legal/Documents/Policies%20and%20Guidelines/Predatory%20Lending%20Guidelines.pdf|title=Unlawful Discriminatory Predatory and Reverse Redlining Guidelines in Housing and Commercial Property|last=Human Relations Commission|first=Pennsylvania|date=2017-09-27|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''right to adequate clothing''', or the '''right to clothing''', is recognized as a [[human right]] in various [[international human rights instruments]]; this, together with the [[right to food]] and the [[right to housing]], are parts of the [[right to an adequate standard of living]] as recognized under [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights#Right to an adequate standard of living|Article 11]] of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR). The right to clothing is similarly recognized under [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights#Article 25|Article 25]] of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR).{{sfn |James |2008 |p=1}}

==Beneficiaries==
The right to clothing forms an aspect of the right to an adequate standard of living, and as such, is regarded as something that needs to be ensured so as to prevent people from living below the poverty line.{{sfn |IHRC |2014}} Indeed, being ill-clothed is emblematic of acute poverty:

{{Quote |We see it in the shivering or sweltering discomfort of 'beggars,' the homeless, the drug dependent and the 'derelict,' the elderly, the invalided, the 'street kid' or the just plain poor. Their plight has provoked condemnation, blame, disgust and derision, but religious, moral and secular creeds have in contrast exhorted us to respond with love, charity, mercy, with empathy and in a spirit of justice.{{sfn |James |2008 |pp=1-2}}|Dr Stephen James |A Forgotten Right? The Right to Clothing in International Law}}

To illustrate how far-reaching the right to clothing potentially is, Dr Stephen James has provided a non-exhaustive list of beneficiaries of the right to minimum clothing. Included on this list are those sections of society that suffer the greatest from a lack of clothing, such as:{{sfn |James |2008 |p=3}}

[[File:Homesless in Roma.jpg|thumb|The homeless are a section of society that suffer greatly from a lack of adequate clothing.]]
[[File:Street Child, Srimangal Railway Station.jpg|thumb|[[Street child]]ren also suffer greatly.]]

* The poor, including the [[unemployed]], [[underemployment|under-employed]] and [[working poor]];
* [[Pensioner]]s and others dependent on [[social security]];
* The [[homeless]] and others in inadequate shelter;
* Those in emergency accommodation (for example, [[Women's Refuges|women's refuges]]), whether of a state or private character (including charitable accommodation);
* The elderly, whether in privately owned or rented accommodation, or state, commercial or charitable nursing homes, hospitals and hospices;
* Persons suffering from serious mental illness or from intellectual or physical disabilities (whether the live at home independently, with family members or others, or in Community Residential Units, half-way houses, public or private hospitals and other institutions);
* Children and adolescents, especially [[orphans]] and juvenile offenders in foster care, state institutions or detention centres;
* The ill and injured in hospitals (or rehabilitation centres), including those being treated for [[alcoholism]] and other [[Drug addiction|drug-related dependencies]];
* Prisoners, on remand or otherwise;
* Workers in hazardous industries (for instance, [[chemical manufacturing]] and [[mining]] industries), or working under generally oppressive conditions (for example, [[sweatshops]]), whose lives or health depend on protective clothing (including child workers);
* [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous persons]] living in impoverished conditions;
* [[Refugees]], [[asylum-seekers]], and [[migrant workers]] (especially those working in the black market as '[[illegal aliens]]'); and,
* The victims of natural disasters, civil unrest, civil and international war (including [[prisoners of war]]), [[Genocide|genocidal persecutions]] and other traumatic dislocations.

== Recognition ==
The lack of discussion about the right to clothing has led to uncertainty as to the ambit of the right and how much clothing is required. Matthew Craven notes that a minimum level of clothing is what is required to be provided; it is of "paramount importance not least because at minimum levels it represents a question of survival." {{sfn |Craven |1995 |p=287}} This requirement of a "minimum" or "adequate" standard is mirrored in reports from the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child|UN Committee on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC){{sfn |CRC |2005}} and a report from the Consortium For Street Children,{{sfn |CSC |2009}} as well as a number of General Comments from the [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (CESCR) as regards the elderly,{{sfn |CESCR |1996}} disabled,{{sfn |CESCR |1995}} and workers.{{sfn |CESCR |2000}} There is, however, no indication as to what such a "minimum" or "adequate" standard entails: indeed, only rarely has the CESCR questioned a party state of the ICESCR on its performance with respect to the right to clothing.{{sfn |James |2008 |p=4}}{{sfn |Craven |1995 |pp=349, 413}}

There has been limited academic commentary on the ambit of the right to clothing with regards to refugees. James Hathaway has argued that refugees should have access to clothing that suitable for the climate and is sufficient for any work or other roles they may wish to undertake. Furthermore, they should not be compelled to wear any sort of clothing that would lead to social stigma or discrimination as foreigners.{{sfn |Hathaway |2005 |p=503}} On the other hand, however, should refugees choose to wear clothing that is representative of their culture, country of origin or society, they are protected under Article 27 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] to do so.{{sfn |Hathaway |2005 |p=504}} The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has tended towards applying context-specific interpretations on what is an adequate standard of clothing; so far, the right in its general sense has not yet been considered in a general comment.{{sfn |Hathaway |2005 |p=504, footnote 1047}}

The right to clothing has been recognised domestically for millennia &amp;nbsp;– at least partially &amp;nbsp;– but has received very little recognition on the international scene.{{sfn |James |2008 |pp=1-2}} It is not clear why there is a lack of recognition; one author has suggested that the lack of elaboration is due to the variations in cultural needs and wants.{{sfn |IHRC |2014}} However, this explanation has been regarded as "not plausible": Dr James notes that "[c]ultural, environmental and economic variations in 'needs and wants' are surely as marked with regard to housing, health as they are in relation to clothing, but this has not prevented detailed elaboration of those rights in international law."{{sfn |James |2008 |p=4}} Matthew Craven concluded in 1995 that:

{{quote|The right to clothing, although specifically included in the Covenant, has had little attention either from the Committee [CESCR] or independent commentators. As far as the Committee is concerned, no reference to clothing is to be found in reporting guidelines, and only the occasional question has been asked of States by individual members. The impression given is that clothing is not a matter in which the State may exercise a great deal of control, nor one that the Committee feels is of great importance.{{sfn |Craven |1995 |pp=349, 413}}|Matthew Craven |The international covenant on economic, social, and cultural rights : a perspective on its development}}

However, Dr James has remarked: "...none of us can be complacent that we will not find ourselves [...] in need of adequate clothing. The right is of great practical importance. It is an essential subsistence right, not an embellishment or a legal absurdity".{{sfn |James |2008 |p=4}} He also called for further discussion and academic commentary, arguing:

{{quote|We must remember the right to adequate clothing when examining the right to an adequate standard of living in international law. The health, dignity and very lives of a range of vulnerable people [...] can be at risk when they are not adequately clothed. [...] [I]t will be useful to explore the possibilities that lie in reasoning by analogy from CESCR jurisprudence on other rights within Article 11 of the ICESCR. After all, the CESCR has begun to develop criteria, in some cases quite detailed, regarding required standards in relation to 'adequate' housing, health, food, water and so on. There is no reason why a similar approach might not be undertaken in relation to the right to adequate clothing.{{sfn |James |2008 |pp=23-24}}|Dr Stephen James |A Forgotten Right? The Right to Clothing in International Law}}

==Interaction between the right to clothing and other human rights==

As the right to clothing concerns such a fundamental aspect of humanity, it naturally interacts with other human rights that are contained within various human rights instruments.{{sfn |James |2008 |pp=13-17}}

===Right to life===
{{main|Right to Life}}

Everyone has the essential right to life, as confirmed under [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights#Article 3|Article 3]] of the UDHR. However, if people are not adequately clothed, they are far more exposed to the elements. Without warm clothing, a person may well die from [[hypothermia]] during a cold winter; clothing that is inappropriately warm, on the other hand, could contribute to [[heat stroke]], [[dehydration]] and [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]] during summer or in tropical climates. Furthermore, inadequate clothing could increase exposure to [[ultraviolet rays]]; aggravate [[Allergy|allergies]] and skin conditions; and worsen pre-existing medical conditions.{{sfn |James |2008 |p=12}}

Additionally, access to medical care&amp;nbsp;– similarly confirmed under [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights#Article 25|Article 25]] of the UDHR as well as [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights#Right to health|Article 12]] of the ICESCR &amp;nbsp;– can be impeded by inadequate access to clothing, particularly if the access to therapeutic clothing or orthopedic footwear is unavailable or prohibitively expensive.{{sfn |James |2008 |p=12}}

===Right to freedom of expression===
{{main|Freedom of speech}}

Wearing clothes&amp;nbsp;– or more accurately, choosing which clothes to wear&amp;nbsp;– is, for many people, an important part of expression as confirmed under [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights#Article 19|Article 19]] of the UDHR. Persons with serious disabilities may be dress inappropriately, denying their desired expression. Furthermore, being forced to wear dirty, ripped, ill-fitting and even extremely outdated clothing may invite ridicule and contempt and inflict shame.{{sfn |James |2008 |p=13}} This can be particularly true with school children &amp;nbsp;– parents may be reluctant to consider sending a child to school as a result of ridicule and shame brought through the clothing the child wears.{{sfn |Kornbluh |2007 |pp=39–41}} A distinction should be drawn, however, between those who are forced to wear ripped, ill-fitting or extremely outdated clothing and those who consciously choose to wear such clothes as a 'fashion statement'.{{sfn |James |2008 |p=13}}

===Right to freedom from discrimination===
{{main|Freedom from discrimination}}

The clothes that people choose to wear can identify a great number of things about a person: religious affiliations, ethnicity, national or political identity, culture, or race. Arguably, the clothes that an impoverished person wears can indicate their poverty. This sign of poverty or poorer economic status can be a cause of discrimination and of vilification. Additionally, clothing which is culturally distinctive or [[Religious clothing|denotes religious affiliation]] could provoke discrimination and lead to a denial of social, economic, or political opportunities.{{sfn |James |2008 |p=14}}

===Right to freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment===
{{main|Torture|Cruel and unusual punishment}}

There is a large potential for "abuses of trust, for humiliations and various physical abuses in medical and institutional settings, especially in relation to women and children, the disabled and elderly."{{sfn |James |2008 |p=14}} If a person is denied access to adequate clothing &amp;nbsp;– especially essential clothes, such as undergarments &amp;nbsp;– it is possible that they may be rendered vulnerable to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment under the ambit of [[Universal declaration of human rights#Article 5|Article 5]] of the UDHR. Such denial would include forcibly taking clothes, and is of particular importance in the context of detention and prisons: "[o]ne can literally be left naked in the midst of power, a tragic condition [...] seen too often in prisons, in war and in concentration camps."{{sfn |James |2008 |p=14}} Examples of such abuses in [[Abu Ghraib]] prison in Iraq and [[Guantanamo Bay]] have found to have caused serious mental illnesses, including [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], resulting from forcing prisoners to strip naked and parade in front of female guards, as well as male detainees being forced to wear female underwear.{{sfn |Hess |2008}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9066">In [[coding theory]], the '''Sardinas–Patterson algorithm''' is a classical algorithm for determining in [[polynomial time]] whether a given [[variable-length code]] is uniquely decodable, named after August Albert Sardinas and George W. Patterson, who published it in 1953.{{sfnp|Sardinas|Patterson|1953}} The algorithm carries out a systematic search for a string which admits two different decompositions into codewords. As [[Donald Knuth|Knuth]] reports, the algorithm was rediscovered about ten years later in 1963 by [[Robert Floyd|Floyd]], despite the fact that it was at the time already well known in coding theory.&lt;ref&gt;Knuth (2003), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Idea of the algorithm==

Consider the code  &lt;math&gt;\{\, a \mapsto 1, b \mapsto 011, c\mapsto 01110, d\mapsto 1110, e\mapsto 10011\,\}&lt;/math&gt;. This code, which is based on an example by Berstel,&lt;ref&gt;Berstel et al. (2009), Example 2.3.1 p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of a code which is not uniquely decodable, since the string

:011101110011

can be interpreted as the sequence of codewords

:01110 – 1110 – 011,

but also as the sequence of codewords

:011 – 1 – 011 – 10011.

Two possible decodings of this encoded string are thus given by ''cdb'' and ''babe''.

In general, a codeword can be found by the following idea: In the first round, we choose two codewords &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Prefix (computer science)|prefix]] of &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt;, that is,
&lt;math&gt;x_1w = y_1&lt;/math&gt; for some "dangling suffix" &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;. If one tries first &lt;math&gt;x_1=011&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_1=01110&lt;/math&gt;, the dangling [[Suffix (computer science)|suffix]] is &lt;math&gt;w = 10&lt;/math&gt;. If we manage to find two sequences &lt;math&gt;x_2,\ldots,x_p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2,\ldots,y_q&lt;/math&gt; of codewords such that
&lt;math&gt;x_2\cdots x_p = wy_2\cdots y_q&lt;/math&gt;, then we are finished: For then the string &lt;math&gt;x = x_1x_2\cdots x_p&lt;/math&gt; can alternatively be decomposed as &lt;math&gt;y_1y_2\cdots y_q&lt;/math&gt;, and we have found the desired string having at least two different decompositions into codewords.

In the second round, we try out two different approaches: the first trial is to look for a codeword that has ''w'' as prefix. Then we obtain a new dangling suffix ''w''', with which we can continue our search. If we eventually encounter a dangling suffix that is itself a codeword (or the [[empty word]]), then the search will terminate, as we know there exists a string with two decompositions. The second trial is to seek for a codeword that is itself a prefix of ''w''. In our example, we have &lt;math&gt;w = 10&lt;/math&gt;, and the sequence ''1'' is a codeword. We can thus also continue with ''w'=0'' as the new dangling suffix.

==Precise description of the algorithm==

The algorithm is described most conveniently using quotients of [[formal language]]s. In general, for two sets of strings ''D'' and ''N'', the (left) quotient &lt;math&gt;N^{-1}D&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the residual words obtained from ''D'' by removing some prefix in ''N''. Formally, &lt;math&gt;N^{-1}D = \{\,y \mid xy\in D ~\textrm{ and }~ x \in N \,\}&lt;/math&gt;. Now let &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; denote the (finite) set of codewords in the given code.

The algorithm proceeds in rounds, where we maintain in each round not only one dangling suffix as described above, but the (finite) set of all potential dangling suffixes. Starting with round &lt;math&gt;i=1&lt;/math&gt;, the set of potential dangling suffixes will be denoted by &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt;. The sets &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; are defined [[recursive definition|inductively]] as follows:

&lt;math&gt;S_1 = C^{-1}C \setminus \{\varepsilon\}&lt;/math&gt;. Here, the symbol &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[empty word]].

&lt;math&gt;S_{i+1} = C^{-1}S_i\cup S_i^{-1}C&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;i\ge 1&lt;/math&gt;.

The algorithm computes the sets &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; in increasing order of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. As soon as one of the &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; contains a word from ''C'' or the empty word, then the algorithm terminates and answers that the given code is not uniquely decodable. Otherwise, once a set &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt;
equals a previously encountered set &lt;math&gt;S_j&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;j&lt;i&lt;/math&gt;, then the algorithm would enter in principle an endless loop. Instead of continuing endlessly, it answers that the given code is uniquely decodable.

==Termination and correctness of the algorithm==
Since all sets &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; are sets of suffixes of a finite set of codewords, there are only finitely many different candidates for &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt;. Since visiting one of the sets for the second time will cause the algorithm to stop, the algorithm cannot continue endlessly and thus must always [[wikt:terminate|terminate]]. More precisely, the total number of dangling suffixes that the algorithm considers is at most equal to the total of the lengths of the codewords in the input, so the algorithm runs in [[polynomial time]] as a function of this input length. By using a [[suffix tree]] to speed the comparison between each dangling suffix and the codewords, the time for the algorithm can be bounded by O(''nk''), where ''n'' is the total length of the codewords and ''k'' is the number of codewords.{{sfnp|Rodeh|1982}} The algorithm can be implemented using a pattern matching machine. {{sfnp| Apostolico and Giancarlo |1984}} The algorithm can also be implemented to run on a [[nondeterministic Turing machine]] that uses only [[NL (complexity)|logarithmic space]]; the problem of testing unique decipherability is [[NL-complete]], so this space bound is optimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rytter|1986}} proves that the complementary problem, of testing for the existence of a string with two decodings, is NL-complete, and therefore that unique decipherability is co-NL-complete. The equivalence of NL-completeness and co-NL-completeness follows from the [[Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A proof that the algorithm is [[correctness (computer science)|correct]], i.e. that it always gives the correct answer, is found in the textbooks by [[Arto Salomaa|Salomaa]]&lt;ref&gt;Salomaa (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; and by Berstel et al.&lt;ref&gt;Berstel et al. (2009), Chapter 2.3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 15''' of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] contains guaranteed [[Social equality|equality right]]s. As part of the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]], the section prohibits certain forms of [[discrimination]] perpetrated by the governments of [[Canada]] with the exception of ameliorative programs ([[affirmative action]]) and rights or privileges guaranteed by or under the Constitution of Canada in respect of denominational, separate or dissentient schools ([[Section Twenty-nine of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|religious education]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Mendes|editor1-first=Errol|editor2-last=Beaulac|editor2-first=Stéfane |title=Charte canadienne des droits et libertés / Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|date=2013|publisher=LexisNexis Canada|location=Markham, ON|isbn=9780433471400|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rights under section 15 include [[racial equality]], [[sexual equality]], mental [[disability]], and physical disability. In its jurisprudence, it has also been a source of [[gay rights in Canada]]. These rights are guaranteed to "every individual", that is, every [[natural person]]. This wording excludes "[[legal person]]s" such as corporations, contrasting other sections that use the word "everyone", where "legal persons" were meant to be included. Section 15 has been in force since 1985.

==Text==
Under the heading of "Equality Rights" this section states: 
{{cquote|15. (1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.

(2) Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.}}

==Background==
The [[Canadian Bill of Rights]] of 1960 had guaranteed the "right of the individual to equality before the law and the protection of the law."  Equal protection of the law is a right that has been guaranteed by the [[Equal Protection Clause]] in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]] since 1868.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W. ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003), 1067.&lt;/ref&gt;  Section 15 itself dates back to the earliest draft of the Charter, published in October 1980, but it was worded differently. It read,

{{cquote|(1) Everyone has the right to equality before the law and to equal protection of the law without discrimination because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age or sex.

(2) This section does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged persons or groups.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, pages 1062–1063.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the drafting, the guarantee to "everyone" was dropped in favour of "every individual," with the intent that corporations could not invoke equality rights.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, page 744.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, while the original version spoke of equality before the law and equal protection of the law, the section ultimately enacted included guarantees of equality under the law and equal benefit of the law. The reason for these additions was to encourage a generous reading of section 15. In the Bill of Rights cases ''[[Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell]]'' (1974) and ''[[Bliss v. Canada (Attorney General)|Bliss v. Canada]]'' (1979), Supreme Court Justice [[Roland Ritchie]] had said only the application, and not the outcome, of the law must be equal, thereby necessitating an explicit guarantee of equality under the law; and that legal benefits need not be equal, thereby necessitating an explicit guarantee of equal benefit of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, pages 1066–1067.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Charter itself came into effect on April 17, 1982, section 15 was not [[coming into force|brought into force]] until April 17, 1985, in accordance with [[Section Thirty-two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 32(2)]] of the Charter. The reason for this was so that provincial and federal governments would have enough time to review their legislation and make the appropriate changes to any discriminatory laws.

==Meaning and purpose of equality==
According to the Supreme Court of Canada's Section 15 jurisprudence, the equality guarantees of section 15 are aimed at preventing the "violation of essential human dignity and freedom through the imposition of disadvantage, stereotyping, or political and social prejudices, and to promote a society in which all persons enjoy equal recognition at law as human beings or as members of Canadian society, equally capable and equally deserving of concern, respect and consideration." (Iacobucci J. in ''[[Law v. Canada]]'', [1999])

To that end, the Charter recognizes four dimensions of equality, including [[substantive equality]].

* ''Equality before the law'' is equality in the administration of justice, where all individuals are subject to the same criminal laws in the same manner by law enforcement and the courts.
* ''Equality under the law'' is equality in the substance of the law, where the content of the law is equal and fair to everyone so that everyone experiences the same result.
* ''Equal benefit of the law'' ensures that benefits imposed by law will be proportionate.
* ''Equal protection of the law'' ensure that the protections imposed by law will be proportionate so that the human dignity of every person is equally safeguarded by the law.

Unlike formal equality, which overlooks personal differences, substantive equality is concerned with the impact of the law on different groups of individuals. Substantive equality requires that there be an equal impact on the person affected by the law.

==Application of section fifteen==
In any challenge of section 15(1) the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] is always on the claimant. The Supreme Court of Canada has endorsed a [[purposive interpretation]] of Section 15.

===Current interpretation===
After ''[[Law v. Canada]]'' (1999) the question of whether dignity was affected was key to a section 15 analysis. In ''[[R. v. Kapp]]'' (2008), the problems with the dignity analysis were recognized and the dignity analysis was jettisoned. The Court established a two-part test based on the one found in ''[[Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia]]'' (1989): (1) Does the law create a distinction based on an enumerated or analogous ground? (2) Does the distinction create a disadvantage by perpetuating prejudice or stereotyping?

In ''[[Quebec (Attorney General) v. A]]'' (2013) a majority of the Court found that perpetuating prejudice or stereotyping did not form an additional requirement in the second part of the test. The majority itself split on the correct way to apply the second part of the test, leaving the present state of the law on Section 15 unclear.

====Enumerated or analogous grounds====
[[Image:Hendricks-leboeuf2.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Discrimination based upon [[sexual orientation]] is an analogous ground for discrimination, leading all but two provincial courts to legalize [[same-sex marriage in Canada]].]]

The concept of ''enumerated or analogous grounds'' originated in the essential 1989 ''Andrews'' case to refer to personal characteristics that, when being the basis of discrimination, show the discrimination is unconstitutional under section 15. There are nine enumerated grounds explicitly mentioned in section 15, although they are not actually numbered. In practice, the enumerated grounds have been given liberal and broad interpretations. For example, discrimination on the basis of [[pregnancy]] has been ruled to be sex discrimination (''[[Brooks v. Canada Safeway Ltd.]]'').

As section 15's words "in particular" hint that the explicitly named grounds do not exhaust the scope of section 15, additional grounds can be considered if it can be shown that the group or individual's equality rights were denied in comparison with another group that shares all of the same characteristics except for the personal characteristic at issue. A personal characteristic is considered ''analogous'' to the ones enumerated in section 15 if it is "immutable" or cannot be changed or can only be changed at excessive cost (constructively immutable). Thus far, several analogous grounds have been identified:

* [[sexual orientation]] (''[[Egan v. Canada]]'' [1995], ''[[Vriend v. Alberta]]'' [1998], ''[[M. v. H.]]'' [1999]  ''[[Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada]]'' [2000])  This finding has led provincial courts (the Supreme Court declined in ''[[Reference re Same-Sex Marriage]]'' to rule on the issue as the government had voiced its intent to legalize them anyway) to find that laws against [[same-sex marriage in Canada]] would be unconstitutional. In ''[[Halpern v. Canada (Attorney General)]]'' (2003), the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] used section 15 to legalize [[same-sex marriage in Ontario]].
* [[marriage|marital status]] (''[[Miron v. Trudel]]'', [1995], ''[[Nova Scotia (Attorney General) v. Walsh|Nova Scotia v. Walsh]]'' [2002]),
* off-reserve aboriginal status/"Aboriginality-residence" (''[[Corbiere v. Canada]]'').
* citizenship (''[[Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia]]'', [1989], ''[[Lavoie v. Canada]]'' [2000])

As well, the courts have rejected several analogous grounds including:
* having a "taste for marijuana". (''[[R. v. Malmo-Levine]]'')
* employment status (''Reference Re Workers' Compensation Act'' [1989], ''Delisle v. Canada'' [1999])
* litigants against the Crown (''Rudolph Wolff v. Canada'' [1990])
* province of prosecution/residence (''[[R. v. Turpin]]'' [1989], R. v. S. (S.) [1990])
* membership in military (''[[R. v. Genereux]]'')
* new resident of province (''[[Haig v. Canada]]'')
* persons committing crimes outside Canada (''[[R. v. Finta]]'')
* begging and extreme poverty (''[[R. v. Banks]]'')

===Past interpretations: the Law test===
As first outlined in ''[[Law v. Canada]]'', discrimination can be identified through a three-step test.

# Did the ''law, program, or activity'' impose ''differential treatment'' between the claimant and a comparator group? That is, was a distinction created between the groups in purpose or effect?
# If so, was the differential treatment based on ''enumerated or analogous'' grounds?
# If so, did the law in question have a purpose or effect that is ''discriminatory'' within the meaning of the equality guarantee?

====Differential treatment====
This step asks whether there is a formal distinction between the claimant and a comparator group based on one or more personal characteristics or else does it fail to take into account the claimant's current disadvantaged position?

The selection of the ''comparator group'' is integral. They must possess all the qualities of the claimant except for the personal characteristic at issue. (''[[Corbiere v. Canada]]'' [1999] 2 S.C.R. 203)  In ''[[Hodge v. Canada (Minister of Human Resources Development)]]'' (2004), it was noted that a court may reject a claimant's choice for a comparator group, and that choosing the wrong comparator group may cause the rights claim to fail.

In ''[[Withler v. Canada (Attorney General)]]'' (2011), the Supreme Court has jettisoned the ''comparator group'' requirement, mandating that instead a contextual analysis is the way to go. They recognized that comparator group analysis was leading to much injustice, something also noted in ''R. v. Kapp''.

====Discrimination====
For discrimination to be found it must be determined if the burden or denial of benefit harms an individual's ''human dignity'' (''Law v. Canada''). That is, the discrimination will marginalize, ignore, or devalue an individual's sense of ''self-respect'' and ''self-worth''.

''Law'' suggests four "contextual factors" which  can help guide a contextual analysis of whether the imputed distinction violates the human dignity of the claimant. None of these are determinative of discrimination, and the Court must not consider all of them in every case. This list is also not exhaustive, although the standard ''Law'' analysis has yet to develop any additional factors:

# ''pre-existing disadvantage''
# ''correlation between the grounds of the claim and the actual needs, capacities, and circumstances''
# ''ameliorative purpose or effect of the law on more disadvantaged groups''
# ''nature and scope of interest''

Jurisprudence has shown that each of these factors are weighed differently depending on the context.

Pre-existing disadvantage asks whether there was a pre-existing disadvantage or vulnerability experienced by the claimant. In ''Corbiere v. Canada'' McLachlin described this factor to be the most compelling and suggestive of discrimination if proven. However, the absence of a pre-existing disadvantage does not necessarily preclude a claimant from succeeding as seen in ''Trociuk v. British Columbia''.

With correlation between grounds and reality, the claimant must show that there is a link between the grounds raise and the claimant's actual needs, circumstances, and capacities. Discrimination will be more difficult to establish if the law takes the qualities of the claimant into account. In ''[[Gosselin v. Quebec (Attorney General)]]'' [2002] the court was sharply divided on this point. The majority said that the law that provided less social assistance to youth was connected to the ability of youth to find employment easily. However, the dissenters insisted that the evidence did not show this to be actual qualities, but were rather stereotypes.

The ameliorative purpose factor asks whether there is a distinction made for the purpose of aiding an even less advantaged group. If this can be shown then it is unlikely that the claimant would be able to show a violation of their dignity. However, ''Lovelace v. Ontario'' warned that the analysis should not be reduced to a balancing of relative disadvantages.

The final factor of nature and scope considers the nature and scope of the interest affected by the law. The more severe and localized the results of the law for those affected the more likely to show that the distinctions in treatment responsible are discriminatory.

==Enforcement==
Section 15, like the rest of the Charter, is mainly enforced by the courts through litigation under [[Section Twenty-four of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|sections 24]] and 52 of the [[Constitution Act, 1982]]. Such litigation can be very costly.

To overcome this barrier, the federal government expanded the Court Challenges Program of Canada&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccppcj.ca/e/about/about.shtml Court Challenges Program of Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060411165618/http://www.ccppcj.ca/e/about/about.shtml |date=2006-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1985 to fund test cases challenging federal legislation in relation to the equality rights guaranteed by the Charter. Some funding has been provided to challenge provincial laws under a variety of programs in the past, but its availability has varied considerably from province to province.&lt;ref&gt;Arne Peltz &amp; Betsy Gibbons, [http://www.ccppcj.ca/documents/justice-e.html "Deep Discount Justice: The Challenge of Going to Court with a Charter Claim and No Money"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509063345/http://www.ccppcj.ca/documents/justice-e.html |date=2006-05-09 }}, 1999. URL accessed on March 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, the Conservative federal government announced that it would be "trimming the fat and refocusing spending on the priorities of Canadians." This included cutting all funding to the Court Challenges Program.&lt;ref&gt;Canada Department of Finance [http://www.fin.gc.ca/news06/06-047e.html "Press Release"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128092005/http://www.fin.gc.ca/news06/06-047e.html |date=2006-11-28 }}, URL accessed on December 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the newly elected Liberal government announced they would be providing $5 million annually to restore the Court Challenges Program.&lt;ref&gt;Canada Department of Finance [http://www.budget.gc.ca/2016/docs/plan/ch5-en.html "Budget 2016: Chapter 5 - An Inclusive and Fair Canada"], URL accessed on April 15, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Chan was one of the 6 young British artists featured in the BBC’s series [[School of Saatchi]].&lt;ref name="saatchiart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazine.saatchiart.com/articles/artnews/london-solo-show-for-bbc-school-of-saatchi-finalist-suki-chan|title=London Solo Show for BBC School of Saatchi Finalist Suki Chan : Saatchi Art Magazine : News and Updates for Art Lovers|publisher=magazine.saatchiart.com|accessdate=2014-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thebookoftravels"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookoftravels.org/acknowledgements/suki-chan|title=Suki Chan &amp;#124; The Book of Travels|publisher=thebookoftravels.org|accessdate=2014-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the show, Chan elicited rare praise from artist [[Tracey Emin]] who said that her work was better than some established artists. "The film's flipping brilliant," she said. "There's a few artists' names come to mind when I saw it but this knocks spots off them."&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/6624377/Charles-Saatchi-hunts-for-new-star-on-artists-answer-to-X-Factor.html|title=Charles Saatchi hunts for new star on artists' answer to X Factor - Telegraph|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=2014-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chan’s work also received a positive review in The Guardian newspaper from the art critic Robert Clark who wrote “Suki Chan’s art makes us wonder in more ways than one. It enables us to treasure the wonder of the world through daring to suggest the dreadful cost of the loss of such wonderful phenomena.”&lt;ref name="thebookoftravels"/&gt;&lt;ref name="saatchionline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ap.saatchionline.com/art/Photography-Sleep-Walk-Sleep-Talk-film-still/11145/1434865/view|title=Saatchi Art Artist: Suki Chan; Color 2009 Photography "Sleep Walk Sleep Talk, film still"|publisher=ap.saatchionline.com|accessdate=2014-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Chan received a Wellcome Trust Small Arts Award and a grant from the Arts Council of England to develop Lucida, a multi-screen interactive video installation that exposes the complex relationship between the human eye, the brain and vision. The piece was developed in dialogue with scientists including [[Colin Blakemore]], Richard Wingate, [[J. Kevin O'Regan]] and [[Iain McGilchrist]].&lt;ref name="elephant"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elephant.art/5-questions-suki-chan/|title=ELEPHANT.art - 5 Questions with Suki Chan|publisher=ELEPHANT.art|accessdate=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase '''sustainable industries''' is related to the development of [[industry|industrial]] processes in a [[sustainability|sustainable]] way.

== History ==
The earliest mention of the phrase "sustainable industries" appeared in 1990 in a story about a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] group [[Reforestation|reforesting]] a [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical forest]] to help create sustainable industries for the local populace.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, Bill. "Our Troubled Earth – Japan." ''The Seattle Times.'' November 13, 1990. Page F-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, a study entitled “Jobs in a Sustainable Economy” by Michael Renner of the [[Worldwatch Institute]] was published, using the term "sustainable industries".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Renner, [http://www.worldwatch.org/node/886 “Jobs in a Sustainable Economy”]. Worldwatch Institute #104 (September 1991). {{ISBN|1-878071-05-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 1991 report concluded, "Contrary to the jobs-versus-owls rhetoric that blames environmental restrictions for layoffs, the movement toward an environmentally sustainable [[World economy|global economy]] will create far more jobs than it eliminates. The chief reason: non-[[Pollution|polluting]], environmentally sustainable industries tend to be intrinsically more labour intensive and less resource intensive than traditional processes."  Among the features of sustainable industry offered in the paper were [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], resource conservation to meet the needs of future generations, safe and skill-enhancing working conditions, [[Waste minimisation|low waste production]] processes, and the use of safe and environmentally compatible materials. Some of the benefits, however would be offset by higher prices (due to labor costs) and a theoretically larger population needed to perform the same amount of work, increasing the [[Agriculture|agricultural]] and other loads on the system.

In February 2003 the business magazine Sustainable Industries was first published, offering news and analysis of core industries such as [[clean energy]] and [[green building]]. By 2012 the company had expanded to include digital media and event production with the Sustainable Industries Economic Forum in the U.S. Sustainable Industries merged with Triple Pundit in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.triplepundit.com/2011/10/triplepundit-sustainable-industries/ Big News: TriplePundit.com and Sustainable Industries Merge]" Triple Pundit, Oct. 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 2013 Sustainable Industries stopped publishing under its masthead.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://twitter.com/sustainablemag/status/414167450356170753 Farewell Transmission]" Twitter, Dec. 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
