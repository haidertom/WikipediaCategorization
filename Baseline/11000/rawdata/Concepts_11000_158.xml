The '''abstract system of title transfer''' (German ''Abstraktionsprinzip'') is a legal term in [[Law of Germany|German law]] relating to the [[law of obligations]] (''Schuldrecht'') and [[property law]] (''Eigentumsrecht''). Although no express reference to it is made in the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German Civil Code]] (BGB), the concept of separating a personal undertaking to pay or exchange goods or legal rights (e.g. through [[contract]]) from the conveyance of title to those goods or legal rights (e.g. through a [[deed]] or [[land registration]]) is fundamental to German [[private law]] (as well as [[Dutch law]], [[South African property law|South African law]], and [[Common law system|Common law]]).

==General features==
Abstract title transfer dominates the entire BGB and is vital for the understanding of how it treats legal transactions, such as [[contract]]s. For example, under the BGB's system, [[ownership]] is not transferred by a sale contract, as in some other jurisdictions (e.g. France, Spain, Italy, etc.). Instead, the sale contract merely obligates the seller to transfer ownership of the good sold to the buyer, while the buyer is obligated to pay the stipulated price. The buyer does not automatically gain ownership by virtue of the contract of sale whereas the seller has not automatically gained ownership of the money. Article 433 of the BGB explicitly states this obligation of the seller, as well as the buyer's obligation to pay the agreed upon price and take the thing he bought. So, seller and buyer have just made reciprocal undertakings and gained reciprocal obligations. For transfer of ownership, another contract is necessary which is governed by ss. 929 et seq. Thus, in a simple purchase of goods paid immediately in cash, German civil law interprets the transaction as (at least) three contracts: the contract of sale itself, obligating the seller to transfer ownership of the product to the buyer and the buyer to pay the price; a contract that transfers ownership of the product to the buyer, fulfilling the seller’s obligation; and a contract that transfers ownership of the money (bills and coins) from the buyer to the seller, fulfilling the buyer’s obligation.

This doesn't mean that contracts in Germany are more complicated to the people involved. Especially the contracts of everyday life don't differ from those in other countries in their outer appearance. For instance, if someone buys a newspaper at a newsstand without saying one single word to the seller, all the three abovementioned contracts are performed and can be construed to have been performed from the parties' behavior.

==Function==
Although abstract title transfer seemingly contradicts the usual common sense interpretation of commercial transactions, it is undisputed among the German legal community. The main advantage of the abstract system is its ability to provide a secure legal construction to nearly any financial transaction however complicated this transaction may be. A good example is retention of title. If someone buys something and pays the purchase price by installments, the system faces two conflicting interests: the buyer wants to have the purchased goods immediately, whereas the seller wants to secure full payment of the purchase price. Under abstract title transfer, the BGB has a simple answer to that: the purchase contract obligates the buyer to pay the full price and requires the seller to transfer property upon receipt of the last installment. Since the obligations and the actual conveyance of title are in two different contracts, it is quite simple to secure both parties' interests. The seller retains title up to the last payment, and the buyer is merely the holder of the purchased goods. If he fails to pay in full the seller may reclaim his property just like any other owner.

==Critics==
Critics say that what German legal scholars call ''Verpflichtungsgeschäft'' and ''Verfügungsgeschäft'' (i.e. undertakings vs. conveyance) are actually the same thing, but expressed in other words. Stating that this difference turns the transaction into something more secure is a false inference. In fact, all other jurisdictions preserve the same certainty through other legal doctrines and devices in their civil codes, not necessarily demanding a double-analysis of the same matter and treating it like two different legal acts.

This is the main criticism of those jurisdictions that follow the opposite system, the causal system of title transfer (Germ: ''Kausalprinzip'' or ''Prinzip der kausalen Tradition''), which follows the [[canon law]] [[Legal maxim|maxim]] ''solo consensus obligat'', under which the [[meeting of the minds]] in a [[contract of sale]] is sufficient both to create obligations and convey title. This includes mainly jurisdictions that have adopted or been influenced by the [[Napoleonic Code]], e.g. [[Law of France|France]], [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana]], [[Quebec law|Quebec]], [[Law of Spain|Spain]], [[Law of Portugal|Portugal]], [[African French|French-speaking Africa]], much of Latin America, etc.

== Origin of Crabtree effect in yeast ==
Approximately 100 million years ago (mya), within the yeast lineage there was a [[whole genome duplication]] (WGD).&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Kenneth H.|title=Origin of the Yeast Whole-Genome Duplication|url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002221|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=13|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002221|pmc=4529243|pmid=26252643|pages=e1002221}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A majority of Crabtree-positive yeasts are post-WGD yeasts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  It was believed that the WGD was a mechanism for the development of Crabtree effect in these species due to the duplication of [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] (ADH) encoding genes and hexose transporters.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  However, recent evidence has shown that aerobic fermentation originated before the WGD and evolved as a multi-step process, potentially aided by the WGD.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  The origin of aerobic fermentation, or the first step, in ''Saccharomyces'' crabtree-positive yeasts likely occurred in the interval between the ability to grow under anaerobic conditions, horizontal transfer of anaerobic DHODase (encoded by URA1 with bacteria), and the loss of respiratory chain Complex I.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  A more pronounced Crabtree effect, the second step, likely occurred near the time of the WGD event.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Later evolutionary events that aided in the evolution of aerobic fermentation are better understood and outlined in the Genomic basis of the crabtree effect section.

=== Driving forces ===
It is believed that a major driving force in the origin of aerobic fermentation was its simultaneous origin with modern fruit (~125 mya).&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  These fruit provided an abundance of simple sugar food source for microbial communities, including both yeast and bacteria.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Bacteria, at that time, were able to produce biomass at a faster rate than the yeast.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Producing a toxic compound, like ethanol, can slow the growth of bacteria, allowing the yeast to be more competitive.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  However, the yeast still had to use a portion of the sugar it consumes to produce ethanol.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Crabtree-positive yeasts also have increased glycolytic flow, or increased uptake of glucose and conversion to pyruvate, which compensates for using a portion of the glucose to produce ethanol rather than biomass.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Therefore, it is believed that the original driving force was to kill competitors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  This is supported by research that determined the kinetic behavior of the ancestral ADH protein, which was found to be optimized to make ethanol, rather than consume it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Further evolutionary events in the development of aerobic fermentation likely increased the efficiency of this lifestyle, including increased tolerance to ethanol and the repression of the respiratory pathway.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  In high sugar environments, ''S. cerevisiae'' outcompetes and dominants all other yeast species, except its closest relative ''[[Saccharomyces paradoxus]]''.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The ability of ''S. cerevisiae'' to dominate in high sugar environments evolved more recently than aerobic fermentation and is dependent on the type of high-sugar environment.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  Other yeasts' growth is dependent on the pH and nutrients of the high-sugar environment.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Kathryn M.|last2=Liu|first2=Ping|last3=Fay|first3=Justin C.|date=2015-08-01|title=Evolution of ecological dominance of yeast species in high-sugar environments|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.12707/abstract|journal=Evolution|language=en|volume=69|issue=8|pages=2079–2093|doi=10.1111/evo.12707|issn=1558-5646|pmc=4751874|pmid=26087012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genomic basis of the crabtree effect ==
The genomic basis of the crabtree effect is still being investigated, and its evolution likely involved multiple successive molecular steps that increased the efficiency of the lifestyle.

=== Expansion of hexose transporter genes ===
[[Glucose transporter|Hexose transporters]] (HXT) are a group of proteins that are largely responsible for the uptake of glucose in yeast.  In ''S. cerevisiae'', 20 ''HXT'' genes have been identified and 17 encode for glucose transporters (''HXT1-HXT17''), ''GAL2'' encodes for a galactose transporter, and ''SNF3'' and ''RGT2'' encode for glucose sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boles|first=E.|last2=Hollenberg|first2=C. P.|date=1997-08-01|title=The molecular genetics of hexose transport in yeasts|journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews|volume=21|issue=1|pages=85–111|issn=0168-6445|pmid=9299703|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.1997.tb00346.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of glucose sensor genes have remained mostly consistent through the budding yeast lineage, however glucose sensors are absent from ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]''.  ''Sch. pombe'' is a Crabtree-positive yeast, which developed aerobic fermentation independently from ''Saccharomyces'' lineage, and detects glucose via the cAMP-signaling pathway.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  The number of transporter genes vary significantly between yeast species and has continually increased during the evolution of the ''S. cerevisiae'' lineage.  Most of the transporter genes have been generated by tandem duplication, rather than from the WGD.  ''Sch. pombe'' also has a high number of transporter genes compared to its close relatives.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Glucose uptake is believed to be a major rate-limiting step in glycolysis and replacing ''S. cerevisiae''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s ''HXT1-17'' genes with a single chimera ''HXT'' gene results in decreased ethanol production or fully respiratory metabolism.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  Thus, having an efficient glucose uptake system appears to be essential to ability of aerobic fermentation.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  There is a significant positive correlation between the number of hexose transporter genes and the efficiency of ethanol production.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== CNV in glycolysis genes ===
[[File:Ethanol Fermentation english.png|thumb|A scheme of transformation of glucose to alcohol by alcoholic fermentation.]]
After a WGD, one of the duplicated gene pair is often lost through fractionation; less than 10% of WGD gene pairs have remained in ''S. cerevisiae'' genome.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  A little over half of WGD gene pairs in the [[glycolysis]] reaction pathway were retained in post-WGD species, significantly higher than the overall retention rate.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  This has been associated with an increased ability to metabolize glucose into pyruvate, or higher rate of glycolysis.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  After glycolysis, pyruvate can either be further broken down by [[pyruvate decarboxylase]] (Pdc) or [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]] (Pdh).  The kinetics of the enzymes are such that when pyruvate concentrations are high, due to a high rate of glycolysis, there is increased flux through Pdc and thus the fermentation pathway.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  The WGD is believed to have played a beneficial role in the evolution of the Crabtree effect in post-WGD species partially due to this increase in copy number of glycolysis genes.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== CNV in fermentation genes ===
The fermentation reaction only involves two steps.  Pyruvate is converted to acetaldehyde by Pdc and then acetaldehyde is converted to ethanol by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] (Adh).  There is no significant increase in the number of ''Pdc'' genes in Crabtree-positive compared to Crabtree-negative species and no correlation between number of ''Pdc'' genes and efficiency of fermentation.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-55013-3_5|title=Comparative Genomics and Evolutionary Genetics of Yeast Carbon Metabolism|last=Lin|first=Zhenguo|last2=Li|first2=Wen-Hsiung|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642550126|editor-last=Piškur|editor-first=Jure|pages=97–120|language=en|editor-last2=Compagno|editor-first2=Concetta}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are five ''Adh'' genes in ''S. cerevisiae''.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Adh1 is the major enzyme responsible for catalyzing the fermentation step from acetaldehyde to ethanol.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Adh2 catalyzes the reverse reaction, consuming ethanol and converting it to acetaldehyde.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The ancestral, or original, Adh had a similar function as Adh1 and after a duplication in this gene, Adh2 evolved a lower K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; for ethanol.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Adh2 is believed to have increased yeast species' tolerance for ethanol and allowed Crabtree-positive species to consume the ethanol they produced after depleting sugars.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  However, Adh2 and consumption of ethanol is not essential for aerobic fermentation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  ''Sch. pombe'' and other Crabtree positive species do not have the ''ADH2''  gene and consumes ethanol very poorly.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Differential expression ===
In Crabtree-negative species, respiration related genes are highly expressed in the presence of oxygen.  However, when ''S. cerevisiae'' is grown on glucose in aerobic conditions, respiration-related gene expression is repressed.  Mitochondrial ribosomal proteins expression is only induced under environmental stress conditions, specifically low glucose availability.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Genes involving mitochondrial energy generation and phosphorylation oxidation, which are involved in respiration, have the largest expression difference between aerobic fermentative yeast species and respiratory species.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  In a comparative analysis between ''Sch. pombe'' and ''S. cerevisiae'', both of which evolved aerobic fermentation independently, the expression pattern of these two fermentative yeasts were more similar to each other than a respiratory yeast, ''C. albicans''.  However, ''S. cerevisiae'' is evolutionarily closer to ''C. albicans''.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Regulatory rewiring was likely important in the evolution of aerobic fermentation in both lineages.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

== Domestication and aerobic fermentation ==
[[File:Wine Grapes with dusting that contains yeast.jpg|thumb|A close up picture of ripening wine grapes. The light white "dusting" is a film that also contains wild yeasts.]]
Aerobic fermentation is also essential for multiple industries, resulting in human domestication of several yeast strains.  Beer and other alcoholic beverages, throughout human history, have played a significant role in society through drinking rituals, providing nutrition, medicine, and uncontaminated water.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Legras|first=Jean-Luc|last2=Merdinoglu|first2=Didier|last3=Cornuet|first3=Jean-Marie|last4=Karst|first4=Francis|date=2007-05-01|title=Bread, beer and wine: Saccharomyces cerevisiae diversity reflects human history|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=16|issue=10|pages=2091–2102|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03266.x|issn=0962-1083|pmid=17498234}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the domestication process, organisms shift from natural environments that are more variable and complex to simple and stable environments with a constant substrate. This often favors specialization adaptations in domesticated microbes, associated with relaxed selection for non-useful genes in alternative metabolic strategies or pathogenicity.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Domestication might be partially responsible for the traits that promote aerobic fermentation in industrial species.  Introgression and HGT is common in ''Saccharomyces'' domesticated strains.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Many commercial wine strains have significant portions of their DNA derived from HGT of non-''Saccharomyces'' species.  HGT and introgression are less common in nature than is seen during domestication pressures.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  For example, the important industrial yeast strain ''[[Saccharomyces pastorianus]]'', is an interspecies hybrid of ''S. cerevisiae'' and the cold tolerant ''[[Saccharomyces eubayanus|S. eubayanus]].''&lt;ref name=":17"/&gt;  This hybrid is commonly used in lager-brewing, which requires slow, low temperature fermentation.&lt;ref name=":17"/&gt;

== Aerobic fermentation in non-yeast species ==

=== Plants ===
Alcoholic fermentation is often used by plants in anaerobic conditions to produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and regenerate [[NAD+|NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] to allow for glycolysis to continue.  For most plant tissues, fermentation only occurs in anaerobic conditions, but there are a few exceptions.  In the pollen of [[maize]] (''Zea mays'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tadege|first=Million|last2=Dupuis|first2=Isabelle|last3=Kuhlemeier|first3=Cris|date=1999-08-01|title=Ethanolic fermentation: new functions for an old pathway|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138599014508|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=4|issue=8|pages=320–325|doi=10.1016/S1360-1385(99)01450-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[tobacco]] (''Nicotiana tabacum'' &amp; ''Nicotiana plumbaginifolia''), the fermentation enzyme ADH is abundant, regardless of the oxygen level.  In tobacco pollen, PDC is also highly expressed in this tissue and transcript levels are not influenced by oxygen concentration.  Tobacco pollen, similar to Crabtree-positive yeast, perform high levels of fermentation dependent on the sugar supply, and not oxygen availability.  In these tissues, respiration and alcoholic fermentation occur simultaneously with high sugar availability.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tadege|first=M.|last2=Kuhlemeier|first2=C.|date=1997-10-01|title=Aerobic fermentation during tobacco pollen development|journal=Plant Molecular Biology|volume=35|issue=3|pages=343–354|issn=0167-4412|pmid=9349258|doi=10.1023/A:1005837112653}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fermentation produces the toxic acetaldehyde and ethanol, that can build up in large quantities during pollen development.  It has been hypothesized that acetaldehyde is a pollen factor that causes [[cytoplasmic male sterility]].  Cytoplasmic male sterility is a trait observed in maize, tobacco and other plants in which there is an inability to produce viable pollen.  It is believed that this trait might be due to the expression of the fermentation genes, ADH and PDC, a lot earlier on in pollen development than normal and the accumulation of toxic aldehyde.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Trypanosomatids ===
When grown in glucose-rich media, [[Trypanosomatida|trypanosomatid]] parasites degrade glucose via aerobic fermentation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  In this group, this phenomenon is not a pre-adaptation to/or remnant of anaerobic life, shown through their inability to survive in anaerobic conditions.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;  It is believed that this phenomenon developed due to the capacity for a high glycolytic flux and the high glucose concentrations of their natural environment.  The mechanism for repression of respiration in these conditions is not yet known.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bringaud|first=Frédéric|last2=Rivière|first2=Loïc|last3=Coustou|first3=Virginie|date=2006-09-01|title=Energy metabolism of trypanosomatids: Adaptation to available carbon sources|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166685106001150|journal=Molecular and Biochemical Parasitology|volume=149|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1016/j.molbiopara.2006.03.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''E. coli'' mutant ===
A couple ''Escherichia coli'' mutant strains have been bioengineered to ferment glucose under aerobic conditions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  One group developed the ECOM3 (''E. coli'' cytochrome oxidase mutant) strain by removing three terminal cytochrome oxidases (cydAB, cyoABCD, and cbdAB) to reduce oxygen uptake.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  After 60 days of adaptive evolution on glucose media, the strain displayed a mixed phenotype.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  In aerobic conditions, some populations' fermentation solely produced lactate, while others did mixed-acid fermentation.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;[[File:Warburgh Effect.gif|thumb|Myc and HIF-1 regulate glucose metabolism and stimulate the Warburg effect.]]

=== Tumor cells ===
One of the hallmarks of cancer is altered metabolism or deregulating cellular energetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanahan|first=Douglas|date=4 March 2011|title=Hallmarks of Cancer: The Next Generation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867411001279|journal=Cell|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013|pmid=21376230|access-date=|volume=144|pages=646–674}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cancers cells often have reprogrammed their glucose metabolism to perform lactic acid fermentation, in the presence of oxygen, rather than send the pyruvate made through glycolysis to the mitochondria. This is referred to as the [[Warburg effect (oncology)|Warburg effect]], and is associated with high consumption of glucose and a high rate of glycolysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warburg|first=Prof Otto|date=1925-03-01|title=über den Stoffwechsel der Carcinomzelle|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01726151|journal=Klinische Wochenschrift|language=de|volume=4|issue=12|pages=534–536|doi=10.1007/BF01726151|issn=0023-2173}}&lt;/ref&gt;   ATP production in these cancer cells is often only through the process of glycolysis and pyruvate is broken down by the fermentation process in the cell's cytoplasm.  This phenomenon is often seen as counterintuitive, since cancer cells have higher energy demands due to the continued proliferation and respiration produces significantly more ATP than glycolysis alone (fermentation produces no additional ATP).  Typically, there is an up-regulation in glucose transporters and enzymes in the glycolysis pathway (also seen in yeast).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diaz-Ruiz|first=Rodrigo|last2=Rigoulet|first2=Michel|last3=Devin|first3=Anne|title=The Warburg and Crabtree effects: On the origin of cancer cell energy metabolism and of yeast glucose repression|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0005272810006869|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Bioenergetics|volume=1807|issue=6|pages=568–576|doi=10.1016/j.bbabio.2010.08.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many parallel aspects of aerobic fermentation in tumor cells that are also seen in Crabtree-positive yeasts. Further research into the evolution of aerobic fermentation in yeast such as ''S. cerevisiae'' can be a useful model for understanding aerobic fermentation in tumor cells.  This has a potential for better understanding cancer and cancer treatments.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7293">The '''ambient optic array''' is the structured arrangement of [[light]] with respect to a point of observation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trincoll.edu/depts/ecopsyc/perils/folder5/terms.html Terms Used in Ecological Optics]&lt;/ref&gt; American psychologist [[James J. Gibson]] posited the existence of the ambient optic array as a central part of his [[ecological psychology|ecological approach to optics]]. For Gibson, perception is a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up process]], whereby the agent accesses information about the environment directly from invariant structures in the ambient optic array, rather than recovering it by means of complex cognitive processes. More controversially, Gibson claimed that agents can also directly pick-up the various [[affordance]]s of the environment, or opportunities for the observer to act in the environment, from the ambient optic array.&lt;ref name="Noë"&gt;Noë, A. (2004). 3.9 Gibson, Affordences and the Ambient Optic Array. ''Action In Perception ''(pp. 103-106). Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The optic array as reflected angles of light==
Gibson stressed that the environment is not composed of geometrical solids on a plane, as in a painting, but is instead best understood as objects nested within one another and organized hierarchically by size. The ambient optic array, therefore, is also organized hierarchically by size, though the components are the [[solid angles]] from the object to the point of observation. Large solid angles come from the facades of various objects and interspaces between objects in the environment. Smaller solid angles are nested within the larger angles, and detail the facets and finer properties of the object. As the observer explores the environment, her relation to these angles change, and accordingly the appearance of the environment changes. For example, objects appear to grow larger or smaller depending on whether the observer moves towards or away from the object. This is because the angle [[subtended angle|subtended]] by the object to the observer becomes bigger as the observer gets closer, and smaller as the observer recedes. However the objective size of the actual object in the environment never changes.&lt;ref name="Gibson"&gt;Gibson, J. J. (1986). ''The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception''. Hillsdale (N.J.): Lawrence Erlbaum Associates&lt;/ref&gt; Put simply by philosopher [[Alva Noë]], the ambient optic array is "how things look from here in these conditions."&lt;ref name="Noë"/&gt;

==Invariants and direct perception ==
Gibson was interested in the structures of the ambient optic array that are invariant, or structures that remain static regardless of the actions of the observer. For example Gibson noted that the upper hemisphere of the array (the sky) tends to be much less structured and brighter than the lower hemisphere (the cluttered earth). No matter what the observer does, the light will always be structured in this way.&lt;ref name="Reed"&gt;Reed, E. (1996). 4. ''Encountering the World: Toward An Ecological Psychology'' (pp. 48-49). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He also noticed that "[[optical flow]] patterns", or optical flow invariants, are produced in the array as the agent moves about the environment. The above example of objects "growing" or "shrinking" as an observer moves towards or away from them is an example of an optical flow invariant, as the array will always transform like this under those conditions. Gibson hypothesized that agents evolved to ''directly'' access relevant [[information]] about themselves and the environment from the invariant structures in the array, without the need for high level cognitive computations.&lt;ref name="Gibson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Braisby"&gt;Braisby, N., &amp; Cellatly, A. (2012). 3.3 Flow in the ambient optic array. ''Cognitive Psychology'' (2nd ed., pp. 78-79). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, in the aforementioned case of objects appearing to grow or shrink, no cognitive processes mediate the observer sensing the apparent growth in size of the object and the observer perceiving that she has now moved toward the object (or the object has moved toward her).

These invariant properties are linked with Gibson's idea of [[affordance]]s. According to Gibson, an affordance is a property of the environment, much like color and size are. For an animal with the appropriate physiological equipment, a tree affords the ability to climb up it, or the ground the ability to walk upon it. Therefore, he claimed, affordances are also specified in the ambient optic array. This means that not only can an agent directly perceive that there is a horizontal surface or that a tree is a tree, but that a horizontal surface is "walk-on-able" or that a tree is "climb-up-able".&lt;ref name="Noë"/&gt; In fact, the agent's perceptual system is so attuned to the invariant information, Gibson argues, that the agent need not consult any of its prior experiences in order to interact with the environment.&lt;ref name="Braisby"/&gt; This implies that agents pick-up meaning and value directly from the environment, rather than project it onto the world.

== Criticism ==
Many critics have rejected at least some of Gibson's claims. Psychologist [[Richard Gregory]] asserted that Gibson's bottom-up approach to perception is incomplete. He argued that visual illusions like the [[Necker cube]] are the result of the brain's indecision between two equally plausible hypotheses about the cube's orientation. The cube appears to "flip" between these two orientations even though the sensory information remains static. Therefore, Gregory reasoned that top-down processes must mediate perception. In response, Gibson argued that illusions like the Necker cube are the result of artifice and would not be encountered by agents in realistic perceptual situations, and therefore are irrelevant. However, the [[Motion aftereffect|waterfall illusion]] is an example of a naturally occurring illusion and cannot be accounted for by Gibson's theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simplypsychology.org/perception-theories.html Visual Perception Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, these two approaches can be reconciled. For example, [[Ulric Neisser]] developed the perceptual cycle, which involves top-down and bottom-up perceptual processes interacting and informing each other. The processes are causally linked, but of equal importance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://learngen.org/~aust/EdTecheBooks/AECT_HANDBOOK96/08/08-05.html The perceptual cycle.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, [[David Marr (neuroscientist)|David Marr]] claimed that Gibson had profoundly underestimated the intricacy of visual information processing. While useful information may exist directly in the ambient optic array, Gibson does not elaborate on the mechanisms of the direct pick-up of this information. Marr argues that this is a complex information processing problem, and not as simple as Gibson makes it out to be.&lt;ref&gt;Noë, A., &amp; Thompson, E. (2002). 11: Selections from Vision.

'''Anthropodermic bibliopegy''' is the practice of [[Bookbinding|binding books]] in [[human skin]]. As of April 2016, The Anthropodermic Book Project "has identified 47 alleged anthropodermic books in the world's libraries and museums. Of those, 30 books have been tested or are in the process of being tested. Seventeen of the books have been confirmed as having human skin bindings and nine were proven to be not of human origin but of sheep, pig, cow, or other animals."&lt;ref&gt;Megan Rosenbloom, ''[http://iis-exhibits.library.ucla.edu/alhhs/Watermark_Vol_39_No_3_Summer_2016.pdf#page=20 A Book by its Cover: Identifying &amp; Scientifically Testing the World's Books Bound in Human Skin]'', ''Watermark: Newsletter of the Archivists and Librarians in the History of the Health Sciences'', volume XXXIX, number 3 (Summer 2016), page 22&lt;/ref&gt; (The confirmed figures as of  August 2017 have increased to 18 bindings identified as human and 14 disproved.&lt;ref&gt;[https://anthropodermicbooks.org/ The Anthropodermic Books Project], home page, checked 7 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;)

''Bibliopegy'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|ɪ|b|l|i|ˈ|ɒ|p|ɪ|dʒ|i}} {{respell|BIB|lee|OP|i|jee}}) is a rare&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=bibliopegy&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cbibliopegy%3B%2Cc0 Google Ngrams Viewer for ''bibliopegy'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] places it in Frequency Band 2, for 'words which occur fewer than 0.01 times per million words in typical modern English usage. These are almost exclusively terms which are not part of normal discourse and would be unknown to most people. Many are technical terms from specialized discourses.' [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/18644 OED entry for ''bibliopegy''], checked 1 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; synonym for [[bookbinding]]. It combines the [[Ancient Greek]] [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B2%CE%B9%CE%B2%CE%BB%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%BD βιβλίον] (''biblion'' = book) and πηγία (''pegia'', from ''pegnynai'' = to fasten).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/18644 OED entry for ''bibliopegy''], checked 9 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] dates from 1876; [[Merriam-Webster]] gives the date of first use as ''circa'' 1859&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bibliopegy Merriam-Webster definition for ''bibliopegy''], checked 9 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and the OED records an instance of ''bibliopegist'' for a bookbinder from 1824.

The word ''anthropodermic'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|θ|r|oʊ|p|ə|ˈ|d|ɜːr|m|ɪ|k}} {{respell|AN|throh|pə|DUR|mik}}), combining the Ancient Greek [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%84%CE%BD%CE%B8%CF%81%CF%89%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%82 ἄνθρωπος] (''anthropos'' = man or human) and [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B4%CE%AD%CF%81%CE%BC%CE%B1 δέρμα] (''derma'' = skin), does not appear in the Oxford English Dictionary and appears never to be used in contexts other than bookbinding. The phrase 'anthropodermic bibliopegy' has been used at least since [[Lawrence S. Thompson]]'s article on the subject, published in 1946. The practice of binding a book in the skin of its author - as with ''The Highwayman'', discussed below - has been called 'autoanthropodermic bibliopegy'&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, ''Religatum de Pelle Humana'', pages 140-142&lt;/ref&gt; (from [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/αὐτός αὐτός] ''autos'', self).

== History ==
[[File:S. Pinaeus, De integritatis et corruptionis virginum... Wellcome L0030772.jpg|thumb|A book in the [[Wellcome Library]] bound in human skin.]]

One of the earliest examples of a binding claimed to be in human skin is the account published in 1606 of the execution of [[Henry Garnet]] for his involvement in the [[Gunpowder Plot]], ''A True and Perfect Relation of the Whole Proceedings Against ... Garnet a Jesuit''. A copy auctioned in 2007 was claimed by the auctioneer to be bound in Garnet's own skin.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Dibbell, [http://philobiblos.blogspot.co.uk/2007/11/garnet-book-images.html ''Garnet Book Images''] PhiloBiblos, 28 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early reference to a book bound in human skin is found in the travels of [[Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach]]. Writing about his visit to [[Bremen]] in 1710: {{Quote|text=Auch sahen wir noch ein klein Büchelgen in Duodetz, ''[[Martin Moller|Molleri]] manuale præparationis ad mortem''.

During the [[French Revolution]], there were rumours that a [[tannery]] for human skin had been established at [[Meudon]] outside Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbloom, ''Lapham's Quarterly''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Carnavalet Museum]] owns a volume containing the [[French Constitution of 1793]] and ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man]]'' described as 'passing for being made in human skin imitating calf'.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbloom, ''Lapham's Quarterly''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of well-attested anthropodermic bindings date from the 19th century.

Surviving examples of human skin bindings have often been commissioned, performed, or collected by medical doctors, who have access to [[cadaver]]s, sometimes those of executed criminals, such as the case of [[John Horwood]] in 1821 and the [[Red Barn Murder#Execution and dissection|Red Barn Murder]] in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/3573244.stm|title=Killer cremated after 180 years|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=4 July 2007 | date=17 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another tradition, with less supporting evidence, is that books of [[erotica]]&lt;ref name="Thompson1946"&gt;{{cite book|first=Lawrence|last=Thompson|authorlink=Lawrence S.

The [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] preserves a notebook bound in the skin of the murderer [[Burke and Hare murders|William Burke]] after his execution and subsequent public dissection by Professor [[Alexander Monro (tertius)|Alexander Monro]] in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;[https://museum.rcsed.ac.uk/the-collection/key-collections/key-object-page/pocketbook-made-from-burkes-skin Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6kJlKpAQ6?url=https://museum.rcsed.ac.uk/the-collection/key-collections/key-object-page/pocketbook-made-from-burkes-skin |date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What Lawrence Thompson called "the most famous of all anthropodermic bindings" is exhibited at the [[Boston Athenaeum]], titled ''[[Narrative of the Life of James Allen|The Highwayman: Narrative of the Life of James Allen alias George Walton]]''. It is by [[James Allen (highwayman)|James Allen]], who made his [[deathbed confession]] in 1837 and asked for a copy bound in his own skin to be presented to a man he once tried to rob and admired for his bravery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.bostonathenaeum.org/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=353244|title=Narrative of the life of James Allen, alias George Walton, alias Jonas Pierce, alias James H.

The [[Newberry Library]] in Chicago owns an Arabic manuscript written in 1848, with a handwritten note that it is bound in human skin, though "it is the opinion of the conservation staff that the binding material is not human skin, but rather highly burnished goat". This book is mentioned in the novel ''[[The Time Traveler's Wife]]'', much of which is set in the Newberry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newberry.org/time-traveler-s-wife|title=Time Traveler’s Wife - Newberry|website=www.newberry.org|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French astronomer [[Camille Flammarion]]'s book ''Les terres du ciel'' (The Worlds of the Sky) (1877) was bound with the skin donated from a female admirer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hlrecord.org/?p=12516|title=Books Bound in Human Skin; Lampshade Myth? - The Harvard Law Record|website=hlrecord.org|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A portion of the binding in the copy of [[Dale Carnegie]]'s ''[[Lincoln the Unknown]]'' that is part of the collection of [[Temple University]]'s Charles L. Blockson Collection was "taken from the skin of a Negro at a Baltimore Hospital and tanned by the Jewell Belting Company".&lt;ref&gt;Temple University Libraries and Charles L. Blockson, ''Catalogue of the Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection: A Unit of the Temple University Libraries'', Temple University Press, 1990, p. 16. {{ISBN|0877227497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Library of Australia]] holds a book of 18th century poetry with the inscription "Bound in human skin" on the first page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/poems-bound-up-in-a-human-skin/2250959.aspx|title=Poems bound up in a human skin|publisher=Canberra Times|date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An exhibition of fine bindings at the [[Grolier Club]] in 1903 included, in a section of 'Bindings in Curious Materials', three editions of Holbein's '[[Danse Macabre|''Dance of Death'']]' in 19th century human skin bindings;&lt;ref&gt;The Grolier Club of the City of New York.

Other examples of the Dance of Death include an 1856 edition offered at auction by [[Leonard Smithers]] in 1895&lt;ref&gt;Callum James, [https://web.archive.org/web/20101017031405/callumjames.blogspot.com/2009/05/leonard-smithers-human-skin-binding.html Leonard Smithers: Human Skin Binding], ''Front Free Endpaper'' (May 27, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and an 1842 edition from the personal library of [[Florin Abelès]] was [http://www.auction.fr/_fr/lot/reliure-en-peau-humaine-la-danse-des-morts-hellip-1203059 offered at auction] by Piasa of Paris in 2006. Bookbinder Edward Hertzberg describes the Monastery Hill Bindery having been approached by "[a]n Army Surgeon ... with a copy of Holbein's ''Dance of Death'' with the request that we bind it in a piece of human skin, which he brought along."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Ernst Hertzberg and Sons Monastery Hill Bindery| last = Hertzberg| first = Edward| title = Forty-four years as a bookbinder| location = Chicago| date = 1933| page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identification ==

The identification of human skin bindings has been attempted by examining the pattern of [[hair follicles]], to distinguish human skin from that of other animals typically used for bookbinding, such as calf, sheep, goat, and pig. This is a necessarily subjective test, made harder by the distortions in the process of treating leather for binding. Testing a [[DNA]] sample is possible in principle, but DNA can be destroyed when skin is tanned, it degrades over time, and it can be contaminated by human readers.&lt;ref&gt;The Anthropodermic Book Project,
[https://anthropodermicbooks.org/about/the-science/ The Science], checked 13 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, [[peptide mass fingerprinting]] (PMF) and [[matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI) have recently been used to identify the material of bookbindings. A tiny sample is extracted from the book's covering and the [[collagen]] analysed by [[mass spectrometry]] to identify the variety of [[proteins]] which are characteristic of different species. PMF can identify skin as belonging to a [[primate]]; since monkeys were almost never used as a source of skin for bindings, this implies human skin.

The Historical Medical Library of the [[College of Physicians of Philadelphia]] owns five anthropodermic books, confirmed by [[peptide mass fingerprinting]] in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;Beth Lander, [http://histmed.collegeofphysicians.org/welcome/ Fugitive Leaves]&lt;/ref&gt; of which three were bound from the skin of one woman.&lt;ref&gt;Beth Lander, [http://histmed.collegeofphysicians.org/skin-she-lived-in/ The Skin She Lived In: Anthropodermic Books in the Historical Medical Library]&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it the largest collection of such books in one institution. The books can be seen in the associated [[Mütter Museum]].

The [[John Hay Library]] at [[Brown University]] owns four anthropodermic books, also confirmed by PMF:&lt;ref&gt;John Hay Library.[http://library.brown.edu/hay/faq.php#7 Frequently Asked Questions: Is it true the John Hay Library has books bound in human skin?]&lt;/ref&gt; Vesalius's [[De Humani Corporis Fabrica]], two nineteenth-century editions of Holbein's ''[[Dance of Death]]'', and ''Mademoiselle Giraud, My Wife'' (1891).

Three books in the libraries of [[Harvard University]] have been reputed to be bound in human skin, but peptide mass fingerprinting has confirmed only one, [http://id.lib.harvard.edu/aleph/005786452/catalog ''Des destinées de l'ame'' by Arsène Houssaye], held in the [[Houghton Library]].&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Heather. "[http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/houghton/2014/06/04/caveat-lecter/ Caveat Lecter]", ''Houghton Library Blog''. June 4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; (The other two books at Harvard were determined to be bound in sheepskin, the first being [http://id.lib.harvard.edu/aleph/005593425/catalog Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''] held in the Countway Library, the second being a treatise on Spanish law, ''[http://id.lib.harvard.edu/aleph/004317553/catalog Practicarum quaestionum circa leges regias Hispaniae]'', held in the library of [[Harvard Law School]].&lt;ref name=HLSblog&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etseq.law.harvard.edu/2014/04/852-rare-old-books-new-technologies-and-the-human-skin-book-at-hls/ |work=The Harvard Law School Library Blog |title=852 RARE: Old Books, New Technologies, and "The Human Skin Book" at HLS |author=Karen Beck |date=April 3, 2014 |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The Harvard skin book belonged to Dr Ludovic Bouland of Strasbourg, who owned a second, [http://search.wellcomelibrary.org/iii/encore/record/C__Rb1283248 ''De integritatis &amp; corruptionis virginum notis''], now in the [[Wellcome Library]] in London. The Wellcome also owns a notebook labelled as bound in the skin of 'the Negro whose Execution caused the War of Independence', presumably [[Crispus Attucks]], but the library doubts that it is actually human skin.

Peptide mass fingerprinting was also used to determine the binding material for a miniature devotional book in the University of California's [[Bancroft Library]], [http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/record=b10357222~S1 ''L'office de l'Eglise en françois'']. It is now known not to be bound in human skin but horse hide, or a mixture of horse and goatskin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.berkeley.edu/2016/07/25/summer-myth-busters-tackle-campus-tall-tales/ Summer myth-busters tackle campus tall tales], Berkeley News.&lt;/ref&gt;

The binding of books in human skin is also a common element within horror films and works of fiction.

'''Fiction'''
* In [[H.P. Lovecraft]]'s horror story '[[The Hound]]' (1922), the narrator and his friend St John, who are graverobbers, have a collection of macabre artefacts. Amongst them, "A locked portfolio, bound in tanned human skin, held certain unknown and unnameable drawings which it was rumoured [[Goya]] had perpetrated but dared not acknowledge."&lt;ref&gt;H.P. Lovecraft, ''Dagon &amp; Other Macabre Tales''. Sauk City, WI: Arkham House, 1965, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[David H. Keller]]'s short story "Binding Deluxe", first published in ''[[Marvel Tales]]'' (May 1934), a bookbinder uses the skins of the men she murders to create a "deluxe" binding for a set of ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.
* In [[Brian Lumley]]'s story 'Billy's Oak' (1970), a book, the ''Cthaat Aquadingen'', is bound in human skin. Although over 400 years old, it still sweats.
*[[P. C. Hodgell]]'s Kencyr series (1982 onwards) features "the Book Bound in Pale Leather", which appears to be bound in living human skin.
*[[Chuck Palahniuk]]'s novel ''[[Lullaby (Palahniuk novel)|Lullaby]]'' (2002) features a book bound in human skin called "The [[Grimoire]]".
* In the novel ''The Journal of Dora Damage'' (2008) by Belinda Starling, a bookbinder is brought "leather" by a client with which to undertake a "special binding" of this nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Novák|first1=Caterina|title=Those Very ‘Other’ Victorians: Interrogating Neo-Victorian Feminism in The Journal of Dora Damage|journal=Neo-Victorian Studies|date=2013|volume=6|issue=2|url=http://www.neovictorianstudies.com/past_issues/6-2%202013/NVS%206-2-5%20C-Novak.pdf|accessdate=30 November 2015|issn=1757-9481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the novel ''The Eye of God'' (2013) by [[James Rollins]], Vigor receives a package from Father Josip Tarasco that contains a skull and an ancient book bound in human skin. 
* In “The Book Of Life” by Deborah Harkness (the final book in the A Discovery of Witches trilogy) the book is made entirely of human / creature materials including the binding, ink, and paper.

'''Television and cinema'''
*In the ''[[The Evil Dead (franchise)|Evil Dead]]'' series of films and comic books originally created by [[Sam Raimi]] in 1981, a fictional [[Sumer]]ian book called the ''[[Necronomicon|Necronomicon Ex-Mortis]]'' is bound in human skin and inked with human blood.
*In the [[Disney]] film ''[[Hocus Pocus (movie)|Hocus Pocus]]'' (1993), the eldest Sanderson sister's (played by [[Bette Midler]]) fictional spellbook is bound in a patchwork of human skin with an enchanted, moving human eye embedded in the cover.
*[[Peter Greenaway]]'s 1996 film ''[[The Pillow Book (movie)|The Pillow Book]]'' contains a sequence in which the body of a writer's lover is exhumed by an obsessed publisher; and his skin, which she wrote upon after his death, is painstakingly tanned and bound into a book.
*The eponymous book in the Canadian television series ''[[Todd and the Book of Pure Evil]]'' (2010) is allegedly bound in human skin.
*In the episode "Like a Virgin" (2011) of the TV series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', the book containing the spell to release the Mother of All is printed (rather than bound) on human skin.

Back in 1911, a dispute occurred between Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao regarding the latter fielding ineligible English players in the [[1911 Copa del Rey]];&lt;ref name=cien/&gt; they had also employed the services of several (non-Basque) players from [[Atlético Madrid]] which was then a branch of the Bilbao club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://memoriasdelfutbolvasco.wordpress.com/2014/03/30/manuel-garnica/ | title = Manuel Garnica, the "Saint" who scored a goal with Athletic | trans-title =Manuel Garnica, el “Santo” que metió un gol con el Athletic |language=es|website = Memorias del Fútbol Vasco (Memories of Basque Football) | date= 30 March 2014 |accessdate = 15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.abc.es/20120508/deportes-futbol/abci-historia-athletic-atletico-201205071903.html  | title = Athletic-Atlético, historia de dos parientes| trans-title= Athletic-Atlético, history of two relatives| language=es |newspaper = [[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]] | date=8 May 2012|accessdate = 10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation]] introducing a rule for the next year's competition that all players must be Spanish citizens.&lt;ref name=origin&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vavel.com/es/futbol/2017/03/11/real-sociedad/764769-athletic-el-origen-de-la-filosofia.html|title=Athletic Club: el origen de la filosofía|trans-title=Athletic Club: origin of the philosophy| language=Spanish |publisher=[[Vavel]]| date=11 March 2017|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a large proportion of the players in that early era were Basque,&lt;ref name=special/&gt; relying on locals was no impediment to Athletic and they chose to maintain that approach even when the regulations were relaxed some years later.

==Origins of players==
===Ethnic minorities===

That was ended in 2011 when [[Jonas Ramalho]], whose father is [[Angola]]n, made his debut.&lt;ref name=bbcporque/&gt;&lt;ref name=cien/&gt;&lt;ref name=myth&gt;[https://www.si.com/more-sports/2011/11/23/jonas Jonas Ramalho helping to dispel longstanding Athletic Bilbao myth]; ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', 23 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 [[Iñaki Williams]] (born in Bilbao to [[Immigration to Spain|Liberian immigrant]] parents) became Athletic's first black goalscorer.&lt;ref name=methods/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11827/9723739/inaki-williams-becomes-first-black-athletic-bilbao-goalscorer-in-117-year-history Inaki Williams becomes first black Athletic Bilbao goalscorer in 117-year history]; [[Sky Sports]], 20 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Ramalho, in 2000 the first African-born player in the club's youth system was Blanchard Moussayou&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.eus/en/players/1198/blanchard-mooussayou-sambou.html|title=Blanchard Mooussayou Sambou|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose promising career was curtailed by injury; some years later, he stated his belief that it was 'twice as hard' for a black player to make an impact at the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bizkaia.eldesmarque.com/athletic-club/noticias/28239-blanchard-q|title=Blanchard: "El jugador negro tiene aquí doble dificultad" |trans-title=Blanchard: "The black player has double difficulty here"|language=Spanish|newspaper=El Desmarque|date=22 November 2011|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former academy trainee [[Yuri Berchiche]], who rejoined Athletic in the summer of 2018 as one of the club's most expensive signings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/en/football/spanish-football/2018/07/02/5b3a066ae5fdea43378b4650.html|title=Athletic Club seal four-year Yuri Berchiche deal|newspaper=Marca|date=2 July 2018|accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; has an Algerian father but showed no interest in playing for [[Algeria national football team|their national team]] when the matter was put to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.algerie-focus.com/2017/12/football-yuri-berchiche-balaie-possibilite-de-defendre-couleurs-de-lalgerie/|title=Football / Yuri Berchiche balaie la possibilité de défendre les couleurs de l'Algérie|trans-title=Football / Yuri Berchiche sweeps the possibility of defending the colours of Algeria|publisher=Algérie Focus|language=fr|date=10 December 2017|accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://observalgerie.com/actualite-algerie/sport/equipe-nationale-yuri-berchiche-dit-non-a-lalgerie/|title= Équipe nationale : Yuri Berchiche dit non à l'Algérie|trans-title=National team: Yuri Berchiche says no to Algeria|publisher=ObservAlgerie|language=fr|date=16 April 2018|accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, Athletic's academy teams include a small number of players of an ethnic minority (mostly [[Afro-Spaniard]]) background, including Cameroon-born goalkeeper [[Chris Atangana]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://as.com/futbol/2017/11/14/primera/1510687840_265078.html |title=Atangana surge entre los sucesores de Arrizabalaga |trans-title=Atangana emerges among the successors of Arrizabalaga |language=Spanish|publisher=Diario AS |date=14 November 2017 |accessdate=3 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; forward Nico Williams (the younger brother of Iñaki),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bizkaia.eldesmarque.com/athletic-club/noticias/63256-nico-sigue-la-estela-de-inaki-williams |title=Nico sigue la estela de Iñaki Williams |trans-title=Nico follows in the wake of Iñaki Williams |language=Spanish|publisher=El Desmarque  |date=12 October 2017 |accessdate=3 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and defender Loic Boum, also of [[Cameroon]]ian origin, who having been orphaned as a child was a ward of the [[Government of Navarre]] when he moved to the club in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://athletic.elcorreo.com/noticias/201406/04/lezama-pide-permiso-gobierno-20140604171608.html|title=El Athletic, a por un infantil camerunés de Osasuna |trans-title=Athletic, in for a Cameroonian child from Osasuna |language=Spanish|publisher=El Correo |date=5 June 2014 |accessdate=3 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lacanteradelezama.com/loic-boum-es-ya-nuevo-jugador-del-athletic/ |title=Loic Boum es ya nuevo jugador del Athletic |trans-title=Loic Boum is now a new Athletic player |language=Spanish|publisher=La Cantera de Lezama |date=4 August 2014 |accessdate=3 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===French players===
The club also rarely fielded players from the French [[Northern Basque Country]], with [[Bixente Lizarazu]] being the first French Basque to play for the club in 1996&lt;ref name=cien/&gt;&lt;ref name=myth/&gt;&lt;ref name=Voluntad/&gt; and [[Aymeric Laporte]] the first to successfully graduate from the [[youth system]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/these-football-times/2014/dec/08/french-basque-country-rugby-heartland-deschamps-lizarazu |title=The French Basque Country: a rugby heartland with world-class footballers |work=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moyes/&gt;

Laporte's signing in 2009 prompted debate regarding the definitions of the policy, as he had no link to the Basque region through birth or residency, and a blood link only via [[Grandparent#Great-grandparents|great-grandparents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bizkaia.eldesmarque.com/athletic-club/noticias/36668-laporte-tengo-sangre-vasca-por-parte-de-mis-bisabuelos |title=Laporte: "Tengo sangre vasca por parte de mis bisabuelos" |trans-title=Laporte: "I have Basque blood through my great-grandparents" |publisher=El Desmarque |language=Spanish|date=25 July 2013 |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=among&gt;{{cite web |url=http://onlyfootball.fr/?p=513 |title=Aymeric Laporte, un Basque parmi les Basques |trans-title=Aymeric Laporte, a Basque among the Basques |publisher=Only Football |language=French|date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=butterflies&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sofoot.com/aymeric-laporte-a-arrete-de-regarder-les-papillons-173450.html |title=Aymeric Laporte a "arrêté de regarder les papillons" |trans-title=Aymeric Laporte "stopped watching the butterflies” |publisher=So Foot |language=French |date=26 September 2013|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moyes/&gt; He did join a team in the territory, [[Aviron Bayonnais FC|Aviron Bayonnais]],&lt;ref name=ownbio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aymericlaporte.com/en/bio/|title=Biography - Athletic Bilbao signing and beginnings|trans-title=|work=Aymeric Laporte official website |date=|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=butterflies/&gt; but only by arrangement after the initial approach from Athletic, as he was too young to move to a club outside France at the time – he arrived formally in 2010.&lt;ref name=methods/&gt;

{{ill|Yanis Rahmani|eu}}, a [[Algerians in France|Frenchman of Algerian origin]] raised in [[Sestao]],&lt;ref name=abre/&gt; progressed as far as Basconia at the same time as Laporte but did not turn professional with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mirandes.elcorreo.com/noticias/201706/27/extremo-zurdo-yanis-rahmani-20170626234606.html |title=El extremo zurdo Yanis Rahmani se incorpora al Mirandés para las dos próximas temporadas |trans-title=The left winger Yanis Rahmani joins the Mirandés for the next two seasons|language=Spanish|newspaper =El Correo|date=27 June 2017|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Griezmann debate====
[[Antoine Griezmann]], the French forward developed by Real Sociedad, was the subject of debate regarding his eligibility for a theoretical move to Athletic as he emerged as an elite player in 2012.&lt;ref name=impossible/&gt; Hailing from [[Bourgogne-Franche-Comté|Burgundy]], he arrived at the San Sebastián club aged 14&lt;ref name=antoine&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/griezmann-not-interested-bilbao-speculation|title=Griezmann not interested in Bilbao speculation|publisher=FourFourTwo|date=5 September 2013|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but only to play football for their academy teams rather than for some other non-sporting reason, and has no connection to the French Basque Country other than attending school there after signing for Real.

The opinions of some (including Athletic's academy director [[José María Amorrortu]]) &lt;ref name=impossible&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marca.com/en/football/spanish-football/2017/01/19/5880a91522601d4a498b4577.html |title=Athletic Club's impossible dream of signing Griezmann |newspaper=Marca|date=19 January 2017|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; were that his training at a Basque club from a young age adhered to the policy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eitb.eus/es/deportes/futbol/athletic/detalle/900544/el-athletic-interesado-antoine-griezmann--real-sociedad/|title=¿Puede fichar el Athletic a Griezmann?|trans-title=Can Athletic sign Griezmann?|language=Spanish|publisher=EITB|date=6 June 2012|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others insisted that he had the same (ineligible) status as any adult player transferred in by Real and the other local professional clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/es/news/4194/editoriales/2012/09/28/3407931/antoine-griezmann-no-entra-en-la-filosof%C3%ADa-del-athletic-de|title=Antoine Griezmann no entra en la filosofía del Athletic de Bilbao|trans-title=Antoine Griezmann does not enter the philosophy of Athletic Bilbao|language=Spanish|publisher=Goal|date=28 September 2012|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any event, Griezmann showed little interest in joining Athletic,&lt;ref name=antoine/&gt; subsequently moved on to [[Atlético Madrid]]&lt;ref name=impossible/&gt; and was voted the [[2016 Ballon d'Or|world's third best player]] in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/12/cristiano-ronaldo-ballon-dor-fourth-lionel-messi|title=Cristiano Ronaldo wins Ballon d’Or for the fourth time|date=12 December 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; making any move to Bilbao unlikely in the medium term. In respect of any future players of a similar trajectory, Athletic's position on recruitment remains unconfirmed.

===Players of Basque descent===
[[File:Fernando Amorebieta.png|thumb|right|120px|[[Fernando Amorebieta]], born in Venezuela but raised in the Basque Country]]
In 1980 the club was believed to have given serious consideration to signing [[Iker Zubizarreta]], a young [[Venezuelan people|Venezuelan]] of Basque heritage (his grandfather [[Félix Zubizarreta|Félix]] had starred for Athletic in the 1910s) who had impressed at the [[Football at the 1980 Summer Olympics|football tournament]] at the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], but decided not to pursue it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.naiz.eus/en/hemeroteca/gara/editions/2015-08-06/hemeroteca_articles/iker-zubizarreta-el-nieto-de-leon-que-pudo-ser-cachorro|title=Iker Zubizarreta: el nieto de león que pudo ser cachorro |trans-title=Iker Zubizarreta: grandson of a lion who could have been a puppy|language=Spanish|publisher=[[Gara]]|date=6 August 2015|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, media sources claimed that Athletic had shown interest in young [[Mexican people|Mexican]] midfielder [[Jonathan Espericueta]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news 
|url=http://futbol.as.com/futbol/2011/06/26/mas_futbol/1309069655_850215.html |title=Interés por el mexicano Espericueta|trans-title=Interest in the Mexican Espericueta |language=Spanish

===Players from Biscay===
It was once the case that Athletic would usually recruit from the [[Biscay]] province surrounding [[Bilbao]]&lt;ref name=myth/&gt; while the other leading clubs Real Sociedad and [[CA Osasuna|Osasuna]] would focus on players from their respective provinces [[Gipuzkoa]] and [[Navarre]]. In recent decades (with the pool of potential players declining due to a low birth rate in the area),&lt;ref name=lehendakari/&gt; Athletic expanded their recruitment in these other areas in their efforts to accommodate the best players with any Basque links.

That change of focus also led to fewer players from the home province being selected; in a 2011 fixture, none of the Athletic starters or substitutes were from Biscay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.footballwhispers.com/blog/athletic-bilbaos-transfer-policy| title = Football Whispers – Athletic Bilbao’s transfer policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.athletic-club.eus/en/match-statistics/1_4456/2010-11_real-zaragoza_athletic-club.html| title = Real Zaragoza 2 Athletic Club 1 02/03/2011|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in subsequent years more local players made the grade, and the situation appears unlikely to occur again in the near future – twelve of the 25 players in the [[2016–17 Athletic Bilbao season#Squad|2016–17 squad]] were born in Biscay, and in November 2017 a study showed that 77% of players in the academy teams hailed from the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bizkaia.eldesmarque.com/athletic-club/noticias/64416-el-77-de-canteranos-del-athletic-son-vizcainos|title=El 77% de canteranos del Athletic son vizcaínos|trans-title=77% of Athletic homegrown players are from Biscay|language=Spanish|newspaper=El Desmarque|date=27 November 2017|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Players from outside the region===
On the other hand, the definitions of the philosophy are stretched occasionally to accommodate promising youngsters with little Basque connection, which does not always sit well with some of the club's followers.

[[Enric Saborit]], originally from [[Catalonia]], who graduated through the youth and reserve levels to reach the first team, caused questions to be asked when he signed in 2008; he had no connection with the region by birth or blood, but while already 16 years old and playing in [[RCD Espanyol]]'s ''cantera'' teams, he moved to [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] where his mother had relocated for work two years earlier. As soon as he became a resident of the territory, Saborit was deemed eligible by Athletic to play for the club.&lt;ref name=debate&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archivo.marca.com/edicion/marca/futbol/1a_division/athletic/es/desarrollo/1094438.html |title=Saborit abre el debate de la filosofía del club |trans-title=Saborit opens debate on club philosophy |publisher=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]|language=Spanish|date=27 February 2008 |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abre/&gt;&lt;ref name=catalan&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/deportes/futbol/20170104/413083135665/saborit-catalan-athletic.html |title=Saborit, un catalán en el Athletic |trans-title=Saborit, a Catalan at Athletic|publisher=[[La Vanguardia]]|language=Spanish|date=5 January 2017 |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bananas Unpeeled''''' is a 26 minute film shot in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]], investigating the social and environmental issues faced by [[plantation]] workers and small farmers in the Caribbean.
It examines [[fair trade]] policies and labeling as a positive alternative for workers on plantations where harsh working conditions and environmental damage are the norm.

The film was made by independent film-maker [[Nick Shaw]] and introduced by the political activist and comedian [[Mark Thomas]].

This educational resource (the film and corresponding teacher action booklet) was quickly taken up by leading British [[NGO]]'s ([[OXFAM]], [[People &amp; Planet]]). Used extensively by schools, universities, [[trade union]] organisations, etc., it helped with the introduction of the "[[fair trade banana]]" into Great Britain.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} The [[The Co-operative Group|Co-Op UK supermarket chain]] was the first to introduce Fair trade Bananas into their stores. To date, several other supermarket chains have followed this example (e.g. [[Waitrose]], [[Sainsbury's]]).

The story behind the making of the film is mentioned in the 2008 book ''Fighting the Banana Wars and other Fairtrade Battles'' by Harriet Lamb, [[Order of the British Empire|C.B.E.]], director of the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] (UK).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lamb | first = Harriet | title = Fighting the Banana Wars and Other Fairtrade Battles | publisher = Rider &amp; Co | location = London | year = 2008 | isbn = 1-84604-083-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Başbağlar massacre''' ({{lang-tr|Başbağlar Katliamı}}) is the name given to the 5 July 1993 event in which 33 civilians were killed, and the village of [[Başbağlar]] near [[Erzincan]] burnt down. Ex-special forces soldier Ayhan Çarkin claimed that the [[Deep state in Turkey|deep state]] was behind the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;Basbaglar katliami, Bilan kazasi olayi, Jave köyleri...Ayni ekip yapti bunlari. Basbaglar katliami kesinlikle Ergenekon zihniyeti ürünüdür, [http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/ayhan-carkin-emniyette-1044071]&lt;/ref&gt; The attack was attributed to the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK). Some journalists and politicians have argued that both incidents were part of a "[[strategy of tension]]" that was part of [[1993 alleged Turkish military coup|an alleged military coup in 1993]].

== Background ==
The small village of [[Başbağlar]] is located 220 kilometers from the city of [[Erzincan]] in the eastern [[Anatolia]]n [[Erzincan Province|province of Erzincan]]'s [[Kemaliye|Kemaliye district]].

==Incident==
Turkish authorities claimed that approximately 100 heavily armed militants rampaged through the village, dragged all the civilians to the village square and burned their homes and property. After an hour of propaganda session dozens of men from the village were killed in front of their families. The militants then moved on to setting the whole village on fire. 214 homes, the school, the mosque and the community center were burnt down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haber10.com/haber/129118/ "Başbağlar da 15 yıldır adalet bekliyor"], Haber10, July 6, 2008.

The Başbağlar massacre is considered one of the bloodiest mass killings in the history of the PKK. The massacre, in which those killed were [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]], is believed to have been in retaliation for the [[Sivas massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/Default.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=sorrow-of-basbaglar-massacre-will-not-be-forgotten-says-minister-2010-07-05|title=Turkish minister remembers victims of Başbağlar massacre|last=|first=|date=|website=Hürriyet Daily News|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
Nearly twenty people were allegedly arrested as part of the investigation, in which two people were jailed and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] for being members of the PKK. Turkish authorities claimed that although the PKK apparently claimed responsibility for the attack, during interrogations, jailed PKK leader [[Abdullah Öcalan]] said that he had been unaware of the incident. In 1998 the case was closed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radikal.com.tr/1998/10/24/turkiye/bas.html "Başbağlar'da geç gelen adalet" (Late justice at Başbağlar)], [[Radikal]], October 24, 1998.

== Reactions ==
On 5 July 2010, the Turkish minister [[Faruk Çelik]] visited Başbağlar to commemorate the day, he said: "No matter how many years pass after this incident, we will never forget this sorrow and those who caused it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/Default.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=sorrow-of-basbaglar-massacre-will-not-be-forgotten-says-minister-2010-07-05|title=Turkish minister remembers victims of Başbağlar massacre|last=|first=|date=|website=Hürriyet Daily News|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11795">In [[mathematics]], a '''Borel set''' is any set in a [[topological space]] that can be formed from [[open set]]s (or, equivalently, from [[closed set]]s) through the operations of [[countable]] [[union (set theory)|union]], countable [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]], and [[relative complement]].  Borel sets are named after [[Émile Borel]].

For a topological space ''X'', the collection of all Borel sets on ''X'' forms a [[sigma-algebra|&amp;sigma;-algebra]], known as the '''Borel algebra''' or '''Borel &amp;sigma;-algebra'''.  The Borel algebra on ''X'' is the smallest σ-algebra containing all open sets (or, equivalently, all closed sets).

Borel sets are important in [[measure theory]], since any measure defined on the open sets of a space, or on the closed sets of a space, must also be defined on all Borel sets of that space. Any measure defined on the Borel sets is called a [[Borel measure]].  Borel sets and the associated [[Borel hierarchy]] also play a fundamental role in [[descriptive set theory]].

In some contexts, Borel sets are defined to be generated by the [[compact set]]s of the topological space, rather than the open sets. The two definitions are equivalent for many [[well-behaved]] spaces, including all [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[σ-compact space]]s, but can be different in more [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] spaces.

== Generating the Borel algebra ==

In the case ''X'' is a [[metric space]], the Borel algebra in the first sense may be described ''generatively'' as follows.

For a collection ''T'' of subsets of ''X'' (that is, for any subset of the [[power set]] P(''X'') of ''X''), let
* &lt;math&gt;T_\sigma &lt;/math&gt; be all countable unions of elements of ''T''
* &lt;math&gt;T_\delta &lt;/math&gt; be all countable intersections of elements of ''T''
* &lt;math&gt; T_{\delta\sigma}=(T_\delta)_\sigma.&lt;/math&gt;

Now define by [[transfinite induction]] a sequence ''G&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'', where ''m'' is an [[ordinal number]], in the following manner:
* For the base case of the definition, let &lt;math&gt; G^0&lt;/math&gt; be the collection of open subsets of ''X''.
* If ''i'' is not a [[limit ordinal]], then ''i'' has an immediately preceding ordinal ''i &amp;minus; 1''. Let 
*: &lt;math&gt; G^i = [G^{i-1}]_{\delta \sigma}.&lt;/math&gt;
* If ''i'' is a limit ordinal, set
*:&lt;math&gt; G^i = \bigcup_{j &lt; i} G^j. &lt;/math&gt;

The claim is that the Borel algebra is ''G''&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, where ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[first uncountable ordinal|first uncountable ordinal number]]. That is, the Borel algebra can be ''generated'' from the class of open sets by iterating the operation

:&lt;math&gt; G \mapsto G_{\delta \sigma}. &lt;/math&gt;

to the first uncountable ordinal.

To prove this claim, note that any open set in a metric space is the union of an increasing sequence of closed sets. In particular, complementation of sets maps ''G&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' into itself for any limit ordinal  ''m''; moreover if ''m'' is an uncountable limit ordinal, ''G&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' is closed under countable unions.

Note that for each Borel set ''B'', there is some countable ordinal &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''B'' can be obtained by iterating the operation over &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;. However, as ''B'' varies over all Borel sets, &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; will vary over all the countable ordinals, and thus the first ordinal at which all the Borel sets are obtained is &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the first uncountable ordinal.

=== Example ===
An important example, especially in the [[probability theory|theory of probability]], is the Borel algebra on the set of [[real number]]s. It is the algebra on which the [[Borel measure]] is defined.  Given a real random variable defined on a [[probability space]], its  [[probability distribution]] is by definition also a measure on the Borel algebra.

The Borel algebra on the reals is the smallest σ-algebra on '''R''' which contains all the [[interval (mathematics)|intervals]].

In the construction by transfinite induction, it can be shown that, in each step, the [[cardinality|number]] of sets is, at most, the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. So, the total number of Borel sets is less than or equal to
:&lt;math&gt;\aleph_1 \cdot 2 ^ {\aleph_0}\, = 2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;.

In fact, the cardinality of the collection of Borel sets is equal to that of the continuum (compare to the number of Lebesgue measurable sets that exist, which is strictly larger and equal to &lt;math&gt;2^{2^{\aleph_0}}&lt;/math&gt;).

== Standard Borel spaces and Kuratowski theorems ==

{{see also|Standard Borel space}}

Let ''X'' be a topological space. The '''Borel space''' associated to ''X'' is the pair (''X'',''B''), where ''B'' is the σ-algebra of Borel sets of ''X''.

[[George Mackey|Mackey]] defined a Borel space somewhat differently, writing that it is "a set together with a distinguished σ-field of subsets called its Borel sets." &lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Mackey| first=G.W. | title=Ergodic  Theory  and Virtual  Groups |  year=1966 | journal=Math. Ann.|volume=166|pages=187&amp;ndash;207|publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]]|issue=3|authorlink=George Mackey|doi=10.1007/BF01361167|issn=0025-5831|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01361167|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern usage is to call the distinguished sub-algebra ''measurable sets'' and such spaces [[measurable space|''measurable spaces'']]. The reason for this distinction is that the Borel sets are the σ-algebra generated by ''open'' sets (of a topological space), whereas Mackey's definition refers to a set equipped with an ''arbitrary'' σ-algebra. There exist measurable spaces that are not Borel spaces, for any choice of topology on the underlying space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathoverflow.net/questions/87838/is-every-sigma-algebra-the-borel-algebra-of-a-topology Jochen Wengenroth (mathoverflow.net/users/21051), Is every sigma-algebra the Borel algebra of a topology?, http://mathoverflow.net/questions/87888 (version: 2012-02-09)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Measurable spaces form a [[category (mathematics)|category]] in which the [[morphism]]s are [[measurable function]]s between measurable spaces. A function &lt;math&gt;f:X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; is [[measurable function|measurable]] if it [[pullback|pulls back]] measurable sets, i.e., for all measurable sets ''B'' in ''Y'', &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt; is a measurable set in ''X''.

'''Theorem'''.  Let ''X'' be a [[Polish space]], that is, a topological space such that there is a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] ''d'' on ''X'' which defines the topology of ''X'' and which makes ''X'' a complete [[separable space|separable]] metric space.  Then ''X'' as a Borel  space is [[isomorphic]] to one of
# '''R''', 
# '''Z''', 
# a finite space. 
(This result is reminiscent of [[Maharam's theorem]].)

Considered as Borel spaces, the real line '''R''', the union of '''R''' with a countable set, and '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; are isomorphic.

A '''[[standard Borel space]]''' is the Borel space associated to a [[Polish space]]. A standard Borel space is characterized up to isomorphism by its cardinality,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Srivastava| first=S.M. | title=A Course on Borel Sets |  year=1991 | publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] | isbn=0-387-98412-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and any uncountable standard Borel space has the cardinality of the continuum.

For subsets of Polish spaces, Borel sets can be characterized as those sets which are the ranges of continuous injective maps defined on Polish spaces.  Note however, that the range of a continuous noninjective map may fail to be Borel.  See [[analytic set]].

Every [[probability measure]] on a standard Borel space turns it into a [[standard probability space]].

== Non-Borel sets ==
{{anchor|counterexample}}

An example of a subset of the reals which is non-Borel, due to [[Nikolai Luzin|Lusin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Lusin | first=Nicolas | year=1927 | title=Sur les ensembles analytiques | journal=Fundamenta Mathematicae | publisher=Institute of mathematics, Polish academy of sciences | volume=10 | pages=1–95 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; (see Sect. 62, pages 76–78), is described below. In contrast, an example of a [[non-measurable set]] cannot be exhibited, though its existence can be proved.

Every [[irrational number]] has a unique representation by an infinite [[continued fraction]]

:&lt;math&gt;x = a_0 + \cfrac{1}{a_1 + \cfrac{1}{a_2 + \cfrac{1}{a_3 + \cfrac{1}{\ddots\,}}}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; is some [[integer]] and all the other numbers &lt;math&gt;a_k&lt;/math&gt; are ''positive'' integers. Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all irrational numbers that correspond to sequences &lt;math&gt;(a_0,a_1,\dots)&lt;/math&gt; with the following property: there exists an infinite [[subsequence]] &lt;math&gt;(a_{k_0},a_{k_1},\dots)&lt;/math&gt; such that each element is a [[divisor]] of the next element. This set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is not Borel. In fact, it is [[analytic set|analytic]], and complete in the class of analytic sets. For more details see [[descriptive set theory]] and the book by [[Alexander S. Kechris|Kechris]], especially Exercise (27.2) on page 209, Definition (22.9) on page 169, and Exercise (3.4)(ii) on page 14.

Another non-Borel set is an inverse image &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}[0]&lt;/math&gt; of an [[Parity function#Infinite parity function|infinite parity function]] &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{0, 1\}^{\omega} \to \{0, 1\}&lt;/math&gt;. However, this is a proof of existence (via the axiom of choice), not an explicit example.

==Alternative non-equivalent definitions==

According to [[Paul Halmos|P. Halmos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Halmos|1950|loc=page 219}}&lt;/ref&gt; a subset of a locally compact Hausdorff topological space is called a ''Borel set'' if it belongs to the smallest [[Sigma-ring|σ–ring]] containing all compact sets.

Norberg and Vervaat &lt;ref&gt;Tommy Norberg and Wim Vervaat, Capacities on non-Hausdorff spaces, in: ''Probability and Lattices'', in: CWI Tract, vol. 110, Math. Centrum Centrum Wisk. Inform., Amsterdam, 1997, pp. 133-150&lt;/ref&gt; redefine the Borel algebra of a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; as the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;–algebra generated by its open subsets and its compact [[Saturated set|saturated subset]]s. This definition is well-suited for applications in the case where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is not Hausdorff. It coincides with the usual definition if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is [[second countable]] or if every compact saturated subset is closed (which is the case in particular if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is Hausdorff).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29914">Formerly known as the '''World Life Issues on Environment and Development''' (WCED), the mission of the '''Brundtland Commission''' is to unite countries to pursue [[sustainable development]] together. The Chairperson of the Commission, [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], was appointed by [[United Nations]] [[UNSG|Secretary-General]] [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]] in December 1983. At the time, the [[UN General Assembly]] realized that there was a heavy deterioration of the human environment and natural resources. To rally countries to work and pursue sustainable development together, the UN decided to establish the '''Brundtland Commission'''. Gro Harlem Brundtland was the former [[Prime Minister of Norway]] and was chosen due to her strong background in the sciences and [[public health]]. The Brundtland Commission officially dissolved in December 1987 after releasing ''[[Our Common Future]]'', also known as the ''[[Our Common Future|Brundtland Report]]'', in October 1987. The document popularized (and defined) the term 
"[[Sustainable Development]]". ''[[Our Common Future]]'' won the [[University of Louisville]] [[Grawemeyer Award]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=grawemeyer.org&gt;{{cite web|title=1991- The United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development|url=http://grawemeyer.org/worldorder/previous-winners/1991-the-united-nations-world-commission-on-environment-and-development.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103112536/http://grawemeyer.org/worldorder/previous-winners/1991-the-united-nations-world-commission-on-environment-and-development.html|archivedate=2013-11-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization Center for Our Common Future was started in April 1988 to take the place of the Commission.

==History==
Ten years after the 1972 [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]], a number of global environmental challenges had clearly not been adequately addressed.  In several ways, these challenges had grown. Particularly, the underlying problem of how to reduce poverty in low-income countries through more productive and industrialized economy without, in the process, exacerbating the global and local environmental burdens, remained unresolved. Neither high-income countries in the North nor low-income countries in the South were willing to give up an economic development based on growth, but environmental threats, ranging from pollution, acid rain, deforestation and desertification, the destruction of the ozone layer, to early signs of climate change, were impossible to overlook and increasingly unacceptable. There was a tangible need for a developmental concept that would allow reconciling economic development with [[environmental protection]]. Views differed on several questions: were local environmental problems the result of local developments or of a global economic system that forced particularly low-income countries to destroy their environmental basis? Did environmental burdens result mainly from destructive economic growth-based development or from a lack of economic development and modernization? Would reconciling the economy and the environment require mainly technical means by using more resource-efficient technologies or mainly social and structural changes that would include political decision-making as well as changes in private consumption patterns?
The 1980 World Conservation Strategy of the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]], was the first report that included a very brief chapter on a concept called "sustainable development". It focused on global structural changes and was not widely read. The UN initiated an independent commission, which was asked to provide an analysis of existing problems and ideas for their solution, similar to earlier commissions such as the Independent Commission on International Development Issues (Brandt Commission) and the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues (Palme Commission).&lt;ref&gt;Iris Borowy, Defining Sustainable Development: the World Commission on Environment and Development (Brundtland Commission), Milton Park: earthscan/Routledge, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1983, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]], asked the Prime Minister of Norway, [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], to create an organization independent of the UN to focus on environmental and developmental problems and solutions after an affirmation by the General Assembly resolution in the fall of 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/r10/oi.nsf/8bb15fe43a5fb81788256b58005ff079/398761d6c3c7184988256fc40078499b!OpenDocument|title=History of Sustainability&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=epa.gov|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502230314/http://yosemite.epa.gov/r10/oi.nsf/8bb15fe43a5fb81788256b58005ff079/398761d6c3c7184988256fc40078499b!OpenDocument|archivedate=2 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new organization was the Brundtland Commission, or more formally, the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED). The Brundtland Commission was first headed by [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] as Chairman and [[Mansour Khalid]] as Vice-Chairman.

The organization aimed to create a united international community with shared sustainability goals by identifying sustainability problems worldwide, raising awareness about them, and suggesting the implementation of solutions. In 1987, the Brundtland Commission published the first volume of “[[Our Common Future]],” the organization’s main report. “[[Our Common Future]]” strongly influenced the [[Earth Summit]] in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992 and the third UN Conference on Environment and Development in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2002. Also, it is credited with crafting the most prevalent definition of sustainability, as seen below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonfuture.oregonstate.edu/part1/pf1_03.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623004236/http://oregonfuture.oregonstate.edu/part1/pf1_03.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 June 2010|title=This Norwegian's past may connect with your future|date=23 June 2010|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events before Brundtland===

During the 1980s it had been revealed that the [[World Bank]] had started to experience an expanded role in intervening with the economic and social policies of the [[Third World]]. This was most notable through the events at [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Bretton Woods]] in 1945. The ideas of [[neoliberalism]] and the institutions promoting [[economic globalization]] dominated the political agenda of the world's then leading trading nations: the United States under President [[Ronald Reagan]] and the United Kingdom under Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], both classical liberals.

These events led into an era of [[free market]]s built on a distortion of the international order forged in 1945 at Bretton Woods. Bretton Woods was transformed through the 1980s and 1990s, finally ending in 1995 with the establishment of the [[World Trade Organization]] ushered in by United States President [[Bill Clinton]]. Bretton Woods was formed as an arrangement among the industrialized nation states, but was transformed into a global regime of ostensibly free markets that privileged [[multinational corporations]] and actually undermined the [[sovereignty]] of the very national communities that established Bretton Woods.

The Brundtland Report was intended as a response to the conflict between the nascent order promoting globalized economic growth and the accelerating ecological degradation occurring on a global scale. The challenge posed in the 1980s was to harmonize prosperity with ecology. This postulated finding the means to continue economic growth without undue harm to the environment. To address the urgent needs of developing countries (Third World), the United Nations saw a need to strike a better balance of human and environmental well-being. This was to be achieved by redefining the concepts of "economic development" as the new idea of "sustainable development" - as it was called in the Brundtland Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldsustainability.pbworks.com/w/page/15443575/PreludeToBrundtland|title=ProfWork / PreludeToBrundtland|work=pbworks.com|accessdate=18 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118221135/http://worldsustainability.pbworks.com/w/page/15443575/PreludeToBrundtland|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand this paradigm shift, we start with the meaning of the key term: development

===Resolution establishing the Commission===

The 1983 [[UN General Assembly|General Assembly]] passed Resolution 38/161 "Process of preparation of the Environmental Perspective to the Year 2000 and Beyond", establishing the Commission.&lt;ref name="estabRes"/&gt; In A/RES/38/161, the General Assembly:

:"8. Suggests that the Special Commission, when established, should focus mainly on the following terms of reference for its work:

::(a) To propose long-term environmental strategies for achieving sustainable development to the year 2000 and beyond;

::(b) To recommend ways in which concern for the environment may be translated into greater co-operation among developing countries and between countries at different stages of economic and social development and lead to the achievement of common and mutually supportive objectives which take account of the interrelationships between people, resources, environment and development;

::(c) To consider ways and means by which the international community can deal more effectively with environmental concerns, in the light of the other recommendations in its report;

::(d) To help to define shared perceptions of long-term environmental issues and of the appropriate efforts needed to deal successfully with the problems of protecting and enhancing the environment, a long-term agenda for action during the coming decades, and aspirational goals for the world community, taking into account the relevant resolutions of the session of a special character of the Governing Council in 1982;"&lt;ref name="estabRes"&gt;United Nations. 1983.

==Modern definition of sustainable development==
{{Main|Sustainable development}}
The Brundtland Commission draws upon several notions in its definition of [[sustainable development]], which is the most frequently cited definition of the concept to date.

A key element in the definition is the unity of environment and development. The Brundtland Commission argues against the assertions of the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment and provides an alternative perspective on sustainable development, unique from that of the 1980 World Conservation Strategy of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The Brundtland Commission pushed for the idea that while the "environment" was previously perceived as a sphere separate from human emotion or action, and while "development" was a term habitually used to describe political goals or economic progress, it is more comprehensive to understand the two terms in relation to each other (We can better understand the environment in relation to development and we can better understand development in relation to the environment, because they cannot and should not be distinguished as separate entities). Brundtland argues:

"...the "environment" is where we live; and "development" is what we all do in attempting to improve our lot within that abode. The two are inseparable."

The Brundtland Commission insists upon the environment being something beyond physicality, going beyond that traditional school of thought to include social and political atmospheres and circumstances. It also insists that development is not just about how poor countries can ameliorate their situation, but what the entire world, including developed countries, can do to ameliorate our common situation.

The term sustainable development was coined in the paper ''Our Common Future'', released by the Brundtland Commission.
Sustainable development is the kind of development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The two key concepts of sustainable development are:
• the concept of "needs" in particular the essential needs of the world's poorest people, to which they should be given overriding priority; and
• the idea of limitations which is imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet both present and future needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Editorials/Kates-apr05-full.html|title=Environment Magazine - What Is Sustainable Development? Goals, Indicators, Values, and Practice|first=Environment Magazine - Taylor and|last=Francis|work=environmentmagazine.org|accessdate=18 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118214557/http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Editorials/Kates-apr05-full.html|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most agree that the central idea of the Brundtland Commission's definition of "sustainable development" is that of intergenerational equity. In sum, the "needs" are basic and essential, economic growth will facilitate their fulfillment, and equity is encouraged by citizen participation. Therefore, another characteristic that really sets this definition apart from others is the element of humanity that the Brundtland Commission integrates.

The particular ambiguity and openness-to-interpretation of this definition has allowed for widespread support from diverse efforts, groups and organizations. However, this has also been a criticism; perceived by some notable commentators as "self-defeating and compromised rhetoric".&lt;ref&gt;Manns, .J., "Beyond Brudtland's Compromise", Town &amp; Country Planning, August 2010, pp.337-340 {{cite web |url=http://www.tcpa.org.uk/resources.php?action=resource&amp;id=900 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416182659/http://www.tcpa.org.uk/resources.php?action=resource&amp;id=900 |archivedate=2015-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It nonetheless lays out a core set of guiding principles that can be enriched by an evolving global discourse. As a result of the work of the Brundtland Commission, the issue of sustainable development is on the agenda of numerous international and national institutions, as well as corporations and city efforts. The definition gave light to new perspectives on the sustainability of an ever-changing planet with an ever-changing population.

-Brundtland commission
(Our Common Future)
The Report of the Brundtland Commission, Our Common Future, was published by Oxford University Press in 1987, and was welcomed by the General Assembly Resolution 42/187. Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, General Assembly Resolution 42/187, 11 December 1987. One version with links to cited documents Our Common Future, Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987. Published as Annex to General Assembly document A/42/427, Development and International Co-operation is available.

The document was the culmination of a “900-day” international-exercise which catalogued, analysed, and synthesised written submissions and expert testimony from “senior government representatives, scientists and experts, research institutes, industrialists, representatives of non-governmental organizations, and the general public” held at public hearings throughout the world.

The Brundtland Commission's mandate was to: “[1] re-examine the critical issues of environment and development and to formulate innovative, concrete, and realistic action proposals to deal with them; [2] strengthen international cooperation on environment and development and assess and propose new forms of cooperation that can break out of existing patterns and influence policies and events in the direction of needed change; and [3] raise the level of understanding and commitment to action on the part of individuals, voluntary organizations, businesses, institutes, and governments” (1987: 347). “The Commission focused its attention on the areas of population, food security, the loss of species and genetic resources, energy, industry, and human settlements - realizing that all of these are connected and cannot be treated in isolation one from another” (1987: 27).

The Brundtland Commission Report recognised that human resource development in the form of poverty reduction, gender equity, and wealth redistribution was crucial to formulating strategies for environmental conservation, and it also recognised that environmental-limits to economic growth in industrialised and industrialising societies existed. As such, the Report offered “the analysis, the broad remedies, and the recommendations for a sustainable course of development” within such societies (1987:16). However, the Report was unable to identify the mode(s) of production that are responsible for degradation of the environment, and in the absence of analysing the principles governing market-led economic growth, the Report postulated that such growth could be reformed and expanded; this lack of analysis resulted in an obfuscated-introduction of the term sustainable development.

The report deals with sustainable development and the change of politics needed for achieving it. The definition of this term in the report is quite well known and often cited:

:"Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs". It contains two key concepts:
:*the concept of "needs", in particular the essential needs of the world's poor, to which overriding priority should be given; and
:*the idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet present and future needs."

==Structure==
The Brundtland Commission was chaired by former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland. Politicians, civil servants, and environmental experts make up the majority of the members. Members of the commission represent 21 different nations (both developed and developing countries are included). Many of the members are important political figures in their home country. One example is [[William Ruckelshaus]], former head of the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]. All members of the commission were appointed by both Gro Harlem Brundtland and [[Mansour Khalid]], the Chairman and Vice Chairman.

The commission focuses on setting up networks to promote environmental stewardship. Most of these networks make connections between governments and non-government entities. One such network is Bill Clinton's Council on Sustainable Development. In this council government and business leaders come together to share ideas on how to encourage sustainable development. The Brundtland Commission has been the most successful in forming international ties between governments and multinational corporations. The 1992 and 2002 [[Earth Summit]]s were the direct result of the Brundtland Commission. The international structure and scope of the Brundtland Commission allow multiple problems (such as [[deforestation]] and [[ozone depletion]]) to be looked at from a holistic approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/csd/csd15/media/backgrounder_brundtland.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=17 April 2012|website=archive.org|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417131934/http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/csd/csd15/media/backgrounder_brundtland.pdf|archivedate=17 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainability efforts==
The three main pillars of sustainable development include economic growth, environmental protection, and social equality. While many people agree that each of these three ideas contribute to the overall idea of sustainability, it is difficult to find evidence of equal levels of initiatives for the three pillars in countries' policies worldwide. With the overwhelming number of countries that put economic growth on the forefront of sustainable development, it is evident that the other two pillars have been suffering, especially with the overall well being of the environment in a dangerously unhealthy state. The Brundtland Commission has put forth a conceptual framework that many nations agree with and want to try to make a difference with in their countries, but it has been difficult to change these concepts about sustainability into concrete actions and programs. Implementing sustainable development globally is still a challenge, but because of the Brundtland Commission's efforts, progress has been made. After releasing their report, ''Our Common Future'', the Brundtland Commission called for an international meeting to take place where more concrete initiatives and goals could be mapped out. This meeting was held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil. A comprehensive plan of action, known as [[Agenda&amp;nbsp;21]], came out of the meeting. Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 entailed actions to be taken globally, nationally, and locally in order to make life on Earth more sustainable going into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/index.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405221844/http://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/index.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 April 2012|title=DSD :: Resources - Publications - Core Publications|date=5 April 2012|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic Growth===
Economic Growth is the pillar that most groups focus on when attempting to attain more sustainable efforts and development. In trying to build their economies, many countries focus their efforts on resource extraction, which leads to unsustainable efforts for environmental protection as well as economic growth sustainability. While the Commission was able to help to change the association between economic growth and resource extraction, the total worldwide consumption of resources is projected to increase in the future. So much of the natural world has already been converted into human use that the focus cannot simply remain on economic growth and omit the ever-growing problem of environmental sustainability. Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 reinforces the importance of finding ways to generate economic growth without hurting the environment. Through various trade negotiations such as improving access to markets for exports of developing countries, Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 looks to increase economic growth sustainability in countries that need it most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/res_agenda21_02.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408182141/http://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/res_agenda21_02.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 April 2012|title=DSD :: Resources - Publications - Core Publications|date=8 April 2012|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental Protection===
Environmental Protection has become more important to government and businesses over the last 20&amp;nbsp;years, leading to great improvements in the number of people willing to invest in green technologies. For the second year in a row in 2010, the United States and Europe added more power capacity from renewable sources such as wind and solar. In 2011 the efforts continue with 45 new wind energy projects beginning in 25 different states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awea.org/learnabout/publications/reports/upload/3Q-2011-AWEA-Market-Report-for-Public.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118220031/http://www.awea.org/learnabout/publications/reports/upload/3Q-2011-AWEA-Market-Report-for-Public.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on environmental protection has transpired globally as well, including a great deal of investment in renewable energy power capacity. Eco-city development occurring around the world helps to develop and implement water conservation, smart grids with renewable energy sources, LED street lights and energy efficient building. The consumption gap remains, consisting of the fact that "roughly 80 percent of the natural resources used each year are consumed by about 20 percent of the world's population". This level is striking and still needs to be addressed now and throughout the future.&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/climatechange/shared/gsp/docs/GSP1-6_Background%20on%20Sustainable%20Devt.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321094820/http://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/climatechange/shared/gsp/docs/GSP1-6_Background%20on%20Sustainable%20Devt.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social Equality===
The Social Equality and Equity as pillars of sustainable development focus on the social well-being of people. The growing gap between incomes of rich and poor is evident throughout the world with the incomes of the richer households increasing relative to the incomes of middle - or lower-class households.This is attributed partly to the land distribution patterns in rural areas where majority live from land. Global inequality has been declining, but the world is still extremely unequal, with the richest 1% of the world’s population owning 40% of the world’s wealth and the poorest 50% owning around 1%. The Brundtland Commission made a significant impact trying to link environment and development and thus, go away from the idea of environmental protection whereby some scholars saw environment as something of its sake. The Commission has thus reduced the number of people living on less than a dollar a day to just half of what it used to be, as many can approach the environment and use it.These achievements can also be attributed to economic growth in [[China]] and [[India]].&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;

In [[satellite communications]], '''carrier-to-noise-density ratio''' ('''''C/N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''''') is the [[ratio]] of the [[carrier signal|carrier]] [[power (physics)|power]] ''C'' to the [[noise power density]] ''N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', expressed in [[dB-Hz]].
When considering only the [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] as a source of noise, it is called '''carrier-to-receiver-noise-density ratio'''.

It determines whether a receiver can lock on to the carrier and if the information [[encoded]] in the [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] can be retrieved, given the amount of noise present in the received signal. The carrier-to-receiver noise density ratio is usually expressed in [[decibel|dBHz]].

The noise power density, ''N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''=''kT'', is the receiver noise power per [[hertz]], which can be written in terms of the [[Boltzmann constant]] ''k'' (in joules per [[kelvin]]) and the [[noise temperature]] ''T''  (in kelvins).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64795">[[File:Rectangular coordinate systems index lowered.svg|thumb|Two different 3d [[Orthonormal basis|orthonormal bases]]: each basis consists of unit vectors that are mutually perpendicular.]]

In [[geometry]] and [[linear algebra]], a '''Cartesian tensor''' uses an [[orthonormal basis]] to [[Representation (mathematics)|represent]] a [[tensor]] in a [[Euclidean space]] in the form of components. Converting a tensor's components from one such basis to another is through an [[orthogonal transformation]].

The most familiar coordinate systems are the [[Two-dimensional space|two-dimensional]] and [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Cartesian coordinate]] systems. Cartesian tensors may be used with any Euclidean space, or more technically, any finite-dimensional [[vector space]] over the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[real number]]s that has an [[inner product]].

Use of Cartesian tensors occurs in [[physics]] and [[engineering]], such as with the [[Cauchy stress tensor]] and the [[moment of inertia]] tensor in [[rigid body dynamics]]. Sometimes general [[curvilinear coordinates]] are convenient, as in high-deformation [[continuum mechanics]], or even necessary, as in [[general relativity]]. While orthonormal bases may be found for some such coordinate systems (e.g. [[tangent]] to [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]]), Cartesian tensors may provide considerable simplification for applications in which rotations of rectilinear coordinate axes suffice. The transformation is a [[passive transformation]], since the coordinates are changed and not the physical system.

==Cartesian basis and related terminology==

===Vectors in three dimensions===

In [[three-dimensional space|3d]] [[Euclidean space]], ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[standard basis]] is '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;. Each basis vector points along the x-, y-, and z-axes, and the vectors are all [[unit vector]]s (or normalized), so the basis is [[orthonormal]].

Throughout, when referring to [[Cartesian coordinates]] in [[three dimensions]], a right-handed system is assumed and this is much more common than a left-handed system in practice, see [[orientation (vector space)]] for details.
simi
For Cartesian tensors of order 1, a Cartesian vector '''a''' can be written algebraically as a [[linear combination]] of the basis vectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = a_\text{x}\mathbf{e}_\text{x} + a_\text{y}\mathbf{e}_\text{y} + a_\text{z}\mathbf{e}_\text{z} &lt;/math&gt;

where the [[coordinate vector|coordinate]]s of the vector with respect to the Cartesian basis are denoted ''a''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;. It is common and helpful to display the basis vectors as [[column vector]]s

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}_\text{x} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{e}_\text{y} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{e}_\text{z} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

when we have a [[coordinate vector]] in a column vector representation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} a_\text{x} \\ a_\text{y} \\ a_\text{z} \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

A [[row vector]] representation is also legitimate, although in the context of general curvilinear coordinate systems the row and column vector representations are used separately for specific reasons – see [[Einstein notation]] and [[covariance and contravariance of vectors]] for why.

The term "component" of a vector is ambiguous: it could refer to:

*a specific coordinate of the vector such as ''a''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; (a scalar), and similarly for ''x'' and ''y'', or
*the coordinate scalar-multiplying the corresponding basis vector, in which case the "y-component" of '''a''' is ''a''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; (a vector), and similarly for ''x'' and ''z''.

A more general notation is [[tensor index notation]], which has the flexibility of numerical values rather than fixed coordinate labels. {{anchor|indices replace labels}}&lt;!---PLEASE DON'T DELETE THIS ANCHOR, IT'S USED LATER---&gt;The Cartesian labels are replaced by tensor indices in the basis vectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and coordinates ''A''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In general, the notation '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; refers to ''any'' basis, and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; refers to the corresponding coordinate system; although here they are restricted to the Cartesian system. Then:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = a_1\mathbf{e}_1 + a_2\mathbf{e}_2 + a_3\mathbf{e}_3 = \sum_{i=1}^3 a_i\mathbf{e}_i&lt;/math&gt;

It is standard to use the [[Einstein notation]]—the summation sign for summation over an index that is present exactly twice within a term may be suppressed for notational conciseness:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \sum_{i=1}^3 a_i\mathbf{e}_i \equiv a_i\mathbf{e}_i &lt;/math&gt;

An advantage of the index notation over coordinate-specific notations is the independence of the dimension of the underlying vector space, i.e. the same expression on the right hand side takes the same form in higher dimensions (see below). Previously, the Cartesian labels x, y, z were just labels and ''not'' indices. (It is informal to say "''i'' = x, y, z").

===Second order tensors in three dimensions===

A [[dyadic tensor]] '''T''' is an order 2 tensor formed by the [[tensor product]] &amp;otimes; of two Cartesian vectors '''a''' and '''b''', written '''T''' = '''a''' &amp;otimes; '''b'''. Analogous to vectors, it can be written as a linear combination of the tensor basis {{nowrap|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;otimes; '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;xx&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{nowrap|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;otimes; '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;}}, ..., {{nowrap|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;otimes; '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;zz&lt;/sub&gt;}} (the right hand side of each identity is only an abbreviation, nothing more):

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{ccl}
\mathbf{T} &amp; = &amp; \left(a_\text{x}\mathbf{e}_\text{x} + a_\text{y}\mathbf{e}_\text{y} + a_\text{z}\mathbf{e}_\text{z}\right)\otimes\left(b_\text{x}\mathbf{e}_\text{x} + b_\text{y}\mathbf{e}_\text{y} + b_\text{z}\mathbf{e}_\text{z}\right) \\
&amp;  &amp; \\
&amp; = &amp; a_\text{x} b_\text{x} \mathbf{e}_\text{x} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{x} + a_\text{x} b_\text{y}\mathbf{e}_\text{x} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{y} + a_\text{x} b_\text{z}\mathbf{e}_\text{x} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{z} \\
&amp; &amp; {} + a_\text{y} b_\text{x}\mathbf{e}_\text{y} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{x} + a_\text{y} b_\text{y}\mathbf{e}_\text{y} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{y} + a_\text{y} b_\text{z}\mathbf{e}_\text{y} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{z} \\
&amp; &amp; {} + a_\text{z} b_\text{x} \mathbf{e}_\text{z} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{x} + a_\text{z} b_\text{y}\mathbf{e}_\text{z} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{y} + a_\text{z} b_\text{z}\mathbf{e}_\text{z} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{z}  \\
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Representing each basis tensor as a matrix:

:&lt;math&gt; 
{\mathbf{e}_\text{x} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{x}} \equiv \mathbf{e}_\text{xx} = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}\,,\quad
{\mathbf{e}_\text{x} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{y}} \equiv \mathbf{e}_\text{xy} = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}\,,\cdots \quad {\mathbf{e}_\text{z} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{z}} \equiv \mathbf{e}_\text{zz} = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

then '''T''' can be represented more systematically as a matrix:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T} = \begin{pmatrix} 
a_\text{x} b_\text{x} &amp; a_\text{x} b_\text{y} &amp; a_\text{x} b_\text{z} \\ 
a_\text{y} b_\text{x} &amp; a_\text{y} b_\text{y} &amp; a_\text{y} b_\text{z} \\
a_\text{z} b_\text{x} &amp; a_\text{z} b_\text{y} &amp; a_\text{z} b_\text{z}
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

See [[matrix multiplication#The inner and outer products|matrix multiplication]] for the notational correspondence between matrices and the dot and tensor products.

More generally, whether or not '''T''' is a tensor product of two vectors, it is always a linear combination of the basis tensors with coordinates ''T''&lt;sub&gt;xx&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''T''&lt;sub&gt;zz&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{ccl}
\mathbf{T}&amp; = &amp; T_\text{xx}\mathbf{e}_\text{xx} + T_\text{xy}\mathbf{e}_\text{xy} + T_\text{xz}\mathbf{e}_\text{xz} \\
&amp; &amp; {} + T_\text{yx}\mathbf{e}_\text{yx} + T_\text{yy}\mathbf{e}_\text{yy} + T_\text{yz}\mathbf{e}_\text{yz} \\
&amp; &amp; {} + T_\text{zx}\mathbf{e}_\text{zx} + T_\text{zy}\mathbf{e}_\text{zy} + T_\text{zz}\mathbf{e}_\text{zz}  
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

while in terms of tensor indices:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = T_{ij} \mathbf{e}_{ij} \equiv \sum_{ij} T_{ij} \mathbf{e}_i \otimes \mathbf{e}_j \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and in matrix form:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T} = \begin{pmatrix} 
T_\text{xx} &amp; T_\text{xy} &amp; T_\text{xz} \\ 
T_\text{yx} &amp; T_\text{yy} &amp; T_\text{yz} \\
T_\text{zx} &amp; T_\text{zy} &amp; T_\text{zz}
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Second order tensors occur naturally in physics and engineering when physical quantities have directional dependence in the system, often in a "stimulus-response" way. This can be mathematically seen through one aspect of tensors - they are [[multilinear function]]s. A second order tensor '''T''' which takes in a vector '''u''' of some magnitude and direction will return a vector '''v'''; of a different magnitude and in a different direction to '''u''', in general. The notation used for [[function (mathematics)|function]]s in [[mathematical analysis]] leads us to write {{nowrap|'''v''' {{=}} '''T'''('''u''')}},&lt;ref name="MTW notation"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Charles W. Misner|C.W. Misner]], [[Kip S. Thorne|K.S. Thorne]], [[John A. Wheeler|J.A. Wheeler]]|title=[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]|page=|isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}, used throughout&lt;/ref&gt; while the same idea can be expressed in matrix and index notations&lt;ref name="Kibble notation"&gt;{{cite book|title=classical mechanics|year=1973|publisher=McGraw Hill|edition=2nd|series=European physics series|author=T. W. B. Kibble|isbn=978-0-07-084018-8}}, see Appendix C.&lt;/ref&gt; (including the summation convention), respectively:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} 
v_\text{x} \\ 
v_\text{y} \\
v_\text{z}
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 
T_\text{xx} &amp; T_\text{xy} &amp; T_\text{xz} \\ 
T_\text{yx} &amp; T_\text{yy} &amp; T_\text{yz} \\
T_\text{zx} &amp; T_\text{zy} &amp; T_\text{zz}
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 
u_\text{x} \\ 
u_\text{y} \\
u_\text{z}
\end{pmatrix}\,,\quad v_i = T_{ij}u_j &lt;/math&gt;

By "linear", if {{nowrap|'''u''' {{=}} ''ρ'''''r''' + ''σ'''''s'''}} for two scalars ''ρ'' and ''σ'' and vectors '''r''' and '''s''', then in function and index notations:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{T}(\rho\mathbf{r} + \sigma\mathbf{s}) = \rho\mathbf{T}(\mathbf{r}) + \sigma\mathbf{T}(\mathbf{s}) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; v_i = T_{ij}(\rho r_j + \sigma s_j) = \rho T_{ij} r_j + \sigma T_{ij} s_j &lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for the matrix notation. The function, matrix, and index notations all mean the same thing. The matrix forms provide a clear display of the components, while the index form allows easier tensor-algebraic manipulation of the formulae in a compact manner. Both provide the physical interpretation of ''directions''; vectors have one direction, while second order tensors connect two directions together. One can associate a tensor index or coordinate label with a basis vector direction.

The use of second order tensors are the minimum to describe changes in magnitudes and directions of vectors, as the [[dot product]] of two vectors is always a scalar, while the [[cross product]] of two vectors is always a pseudovector perpendicular to the plane defined by the vectors, so these products of vectors alone cannot obtain a new vector of any magnitude in any direction. (See also below for more on the dot and cross products). The tensor product of two vectors is a second order tensor, although this has no obvious directional interpretation by itself.

The previous idea can be continued: if '''T''' takes in two vectors '''p''' and '''q''', it will return a scalar ''r''. In function notation we write ''r'' = '''T'''('''p''', '''q'''), while in matrix and index notations (including the summation convention) respectively:

:&lt;math&gt; r = \begin{pmatrix} 
p_\text{x} &amp; 
p_\text{y} &amp;
p_\text{z}
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 
T_\text{xx} &amp; T_\text{xy} &amp; T_\text{xz} \\ 
T_\text{yx} &amp; T_\text{yy} &amp; T_\text{yz} \\
T_\text{zx} &amp; T_\text{zy} &amp; T_\text{zz}
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 
q_\text{x} \\ 
q_\text{y} \\
q_\text{z}
\end{pmatrix}\,,\quad r = p_i T_{ij} q_j &lt;/math&gt;

The tensor '''T''' is linear in both input vectors. When vectors and tensors are written without reference to components, and indices are not used, sometimes a dot · is placed where summations over indices (known as [[tensor contraction]]s) are taken. For the above cases:&lt;ref name="MTW notation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kibble notation"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{T}\cdot\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; r = \mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{T}\cdot\mathbf{q}&lt;/math&gt;

motivated by the dot product notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} \equiv a_i b_i&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, a tensor of order ''m'' which takes in ''n'' vectors (where ''n'' is between 0 and ''m'' inclusive) will return a tensor of order {{nowrap|''m'' − ''n''}}, see [[tensor#As multilinear maps|Tensor: As multilinear maps]] for further generalizations and details. The concepts above also apply to pseudovectors in the same way as for vectors. The vectors and tensors themselves can vary within throughout space, in which case we have [[vector field]]s and [[tensor field]]s, and can also depend on time.

For the electrical conduction example, the index and matrix notations would be:

:&lt;math&gt;J_i = \sigma_{ij}E_j \equiv \sum_{j} \sigma_{ij}E_j &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} J_\text{x} \\ J_\text{y} \\ J_\text{z} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 
\sigma_\text{xx} &amp; \sigma_\text{xy} &amp; \sigma_\text{xz} \\ 
\sigma_\text{yx} &amp; \sigma_\text{yy} &amp; \sigma_\text{yz} \\
\sigma_\text{zx} &amp; \sigma_\text{zy} &amp; \sigma_\text{zz}
\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} E_\text{x} \\ E_\text{y} \\ E_\text{z} \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

while for the rotational kinetic energy ''T'':

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{1}{2} \omega_i I_{ij} \omega_j \equiv \frac{1}{2} \sum_{ij} \omega_i I_{ij} \omega_j \,,&lt;/math&gt;

===Vectors and tensors in ''n'' dimensions===

In ''n''-dimensional Euclidean space over the real numbers, ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the standard basis is denoted '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ... '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Each basis vector '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; points along the positive ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis, with the basis being orthonormal. Component ''j'' of '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is given by the [[Kronecker delta]]:

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{e}_i)_j = \delta_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;

A vector in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; takes the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = a_i\mathbf{e}_i \equiv \sum_i a_i\mathbf{e}_i \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly for the order 2 tensor above, for each vector '''a''' and '''b''' in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = a_i b_j \mathbf{e}_{ij} \equiv \sum_{ij} a_i b_j \mathbf{e}_i \otimes \mathbf{e}_j \,,&lt;/math&gt;

or more generally:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T} = T_{ij} \mathbf{e}_{ij} \equiv \sum_{ij} T_{ij} \mathbf{e}_i \otimes \mathbf{e}_j \,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Transformations of Cartesian vectors (any number of dimensions)==

[[File:Rectangular coordinate system position vector index lowered.svg|thumb|The same [[position vector]] '''x''' represented in two 3d rectangular coordinate systems each with an [[orthonormal basis]], the cuboids illustrate the [[parallelogram law]] for adding vector components.]]

===Meaning of "invariance" under coordinate transformations===

The [[position vector]] '''x''' in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is a simple and common example of a vector, and can be represented in ''any'' [[coordinate system]]. Consider the case of [[rectangular coordinate system]]s with orthonormal bases only. It is possible to have a coordinate system with rectangular geometry if the basis vectors are all mutually perpendicular and not normalized, in which case the basis is ortho''gonal'' but not ortho''normal''. However, orthonormal bases are easier to manipulate and are often used in practice. The following results are true for orthonormal bases, not orthogonal ones.

In one rectangular coordinate system, '''x''' as a contravector has coordinates ''x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' and basis vectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, while as a covector it has coordinates ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and basis covectors '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;, and we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=x^i\mathbf{e}_i\,,\quad \mathbf{x}=x_i\mathbf{e}^i&lt;/math&gt;

In another rectangular coordinate system, '''x''' as a contravector has coordinates ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' and bases {{overline|'''e'''}}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, while as a covector it has coordinates ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and bases {{overline|'''e'''}}&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;, and we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=\bar{x}^i\bar{\mathbf{e}}_i\,,\quad \mathbf{x}=\bar{x}_i\bar{\mathbf{e}}^i&lt;/math&gt;

Each new coordinate is a function of all the old ones, and vice versa for the [[inverse function]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{x}{}^i=\bar{x}{}^i\left(x^1,x^2,\cdots\right) \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad x{}^i = x{}^i\left(\bar{x}^1,\bar{x}^2,\cdots\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{x}{}_i=\bar{x}{}_i\left(x_1,x_2,\cdots\right) \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad x{}_i = x{}_i\left(\bar{x}_1,\bar{x}_2,\cdots\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly each new basis vector is a function of all the old ones, and vice versa for the inverse function:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{e}}{}_j = \bar{\mathbf{e}}{}_j\left(\mathbf{e}_1,\mathbf{e}_2\cdots\right) \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad \mathbf{e}{}_j = \mathbf{e}{}_j \left(\bar{\mathbf{e}}_1,\bar{\mathbf{e}}_2\cdots\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{e}}{}^j = \bar{\mathbf{e}}{}^j\left(\mathbf{e}^1,\mathbf{e}^2\cdots\right) \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad \mathbf{e}{}^j = \mathbf{e}{}^j \left(\bar{\mathbf{e}}^1,\bar{\mathbf{e}}^2\cdots\right)&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''i'', ''j''.

A vector is invariant under any change of basis, so if coordinates transform according to a [[transformation matrix]] '''L''', the bases transform according to the [[matrix inverse]] '''L'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and conversely if the coordinates transform according to inverse '''L'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, the bases transform according to the matrix '''L'''. The difference between each of these transformations is shown conventionally through the indices as superscripts for contravariance and subscripts for covariance, and the coordinates and bases are [[linear transformation|linearly transformed]] according to the following rules:

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Vector elements

| &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}^j = x^i (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}})_i{}^j = x^i \mathsf{L}_i{}^j&lt;/math&gt;

|-

| &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}_j \bar{\mathbf{e}}^j = x_i (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_j{}^i \mathsf{L}_k{}^j \mathbf{e}^k = x_i \delta^i{}_k \mathbf{e}^k = x_i \mathbf{e}^i&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

where L&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt; represents the entries of the [[transformation matrix]] (row number is ''i'' and column number is ''j'') and ('''L'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the entries of the [[inverse matrix]] of the matrix L&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;.

If '''L''' is an [[orthogonal transformation]] ([[orthogonal matrix]]), the objects transforming by it are defined as '''Cartesian tensors'''. This geometrically has the interpretation that a rectangular coordinate system is mapped to another rectangular coordinate system, in which the [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] of the vector '''x''' is preserved (and distances are preserved).

The [[determinant]] of '''L''' is det('''L''') = ±1, which corresponds to two types of orthogonal transformation: (+1) for [[rotation (mathematics)|rotations]] and (−1) for [[improper rotation]]s (including [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s).

There are considerable algebraic simplifications, the [[matrix transpose]] is the [[inverse matrix|inverse]] from the definition of an orthogonal transformation:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{\mathrm{T}}=\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1}\Rightarrow(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_i{}^j=(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{\mathrm{T}})_i{}^j=(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}})^j{}_i=\mathsf{L}^j{}_i&lt;/math&gt;

From the previous table, orthogonal transformations of covectors and contravectors are identical. There is no need to differ between [[raising and lowering indices]], and in this context and applications to physics and engineering the indices are usually all subscripted to remove confusion for [[exponent]]s. All indices will be lowered in the remainder of this article. One can determine the actual raised and lowered indices by considering which quantities are covectors or contravectors, and the relevant transformation rules.

Exactly the same transformation rules apply to any vector '''a''', not only the position vector. If its components ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; do not transform according to the rules, '''a''' is not a vector.

Despite the similarity between the expressions above, for the change of coordinates such as {{nowrap|''{{overline|x}}&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;'' {{=}} '''L'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;''x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, and the action of a tensor on a vector like {{nowrap|''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''T&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, '''L''' is not a tensor, but '''T''' is. In the change of coordinates, '''L''' is a ''matrix'', used to relate two rectangular coordinate systems with orthonormal bases together. For the tensor relating a vector to a vector, the vectors and tensors throughout the equation all belong to the same coordinate system and basis.

===Derivatives and Jacobian matrix elements===

The entries of '''L''' are [[partial derivative]]s of the new or old coordinates with respect to the old or new coordinates, respectively.

Differentiating ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' with respect to ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\bar{x}_i}{\partial x_k}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x_k}(x_j \mathsf{L}_{ji})=\mathsf{L}_{ji}\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial x_k}= \delta_{kj}\mathsf{L}_{ji} = \mathsf{L}_{ki}&lt;/math&gt;

so

:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{L}_i{}^j \equiv \mathsf{L}_{ij} = \frac{\partial\bar{x}_j}{\partial x_i} &lt;/math&gt;

is an element of the [[Jacobian matrix]]. There is a (partially mnemonical) correspondence between index positions attached to '''L''' and in the partial derivative: ''i'' at the top and ''j'' at the bottom, in each case, although for Cartesian tensors the indices can be lowered.

Conversely, differentiating ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' with respect to ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial\bar{x}_k}=\frac{\partial}{\partial\bar{x}_k}(\bar{x}_i(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{ij})=\frac{\partial\bar{x}_i}{\partial\bar{x}_k}(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{ij}=\delta_{ki} (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{ij}=(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{kj}&lt;/math&gt;
 
so

:&lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_i{}^j \equiv (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{ij}=\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial\bar{x}_i}&lt;/math&gt;

is an element of the inverse Jacobian matrix, with a similar index correspondence.
 
Many sources state transformations in terms of the partial derivatives:

{{Equation box 1

\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the explicit matrix equations in 3d are:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{x}}=\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}\bar{x}_1\\
\bar{x}_2\\
\bar{x}_3
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial\bar{x}_1}{\partial x_1} &amp; \frac{\partial\bar{x}_1}{\partial x_2} &amp; \frac{\partial\bar{x}_1}{\partial x_3}\\
\frac{\partial\bar{x}_2}{\partial x_1} &amp; \frac{\partial\bar{x}_2}{\partial x_2} &amp; \frac{\partial\bar{x}_2}{\partial x_3}\\
\frac{\partial\bar{x}_3}{\partial x_1} &amp; \frac{\partial\bar{x}_3}{\partial x_2} &amp; \frac{\partial\bar{x}_3}{\partial x_3}
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\
x_2\\
x_3
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

similarly for

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1}\bar{\mathbf{x}}=\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{\mathrm{T}}\bar{\mathbf{x}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Projections along coordinate axes===

[[File:Rectangular coordinate systems angles index lowered.svg|500px|thumb|'''Top:''' Angles from the ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' axes to the ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' axes. '''Bottom:''' Vice versa.]]

As with all linear transformations, '''L''' depends on the basis chosen. For two orthonormal bases

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{e}}_i\cdot\bar{\mathbf{e}}_j=\mathbf{e}_i\cdot\mathbf{e}_j=\delta_{ij}\,,\quad\left|\mathbf{e}_i\right|=\left|\bar{\mathbf{e}}_i\right|=1\,,&lt;/math&gt;
 
* projecting '''x''' to the ''{{overline|x}}'' axes: &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}_i=\bar{\mathbf{e}}_i\cdot\mathbf{x}=\bar{\mathbf{e}}_i\cdot x_j\mathbf{e}_j=x_i \mathsf{L}_{ij} \,, &lt;/math&gt;
* projecting '''x''' to the ''x'' axes: &lt;math&gt;x_i=\mathbf{e}_i\cdot\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{e}_i\cdot\bar{x}_j\bar{\mathbf{e}}_j=\bar{x}_j(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{ji} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence the components reduce to [[direction cosine]]s between the ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' axes:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{L}_{ij} = \bar{\mathbf{e}}_i\cdot\mathbf{e}_j=\cos\theta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{ij} = \mathbf{e}_i\cdot\bar{\mathbf{e}}_j=\cos\theta_{ji}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''θ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''θ&lt;sub&gt;ji&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the angles between the ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' axes. In general, ''θ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' is not equal to ''θ&lt;sub&gt;ji&lt;/sub&gt;'', because for example ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; are two different angles.

The transformation of coordinates can be written:

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c}
\bar{x}_j = x_i \left(\bar{\mathbf{e}}_i\cdot\mathbf{e}_j \right) = x_i\cos\theta_{ij}\\
\upharpoonleft\downharpoonright\\
x_j = \bar{x}_i \left( \mathbf{e}_i\cdot\bar{\mathbf{e}}_j \right) = \bar{x}_i\cos\theta_{ji}
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border = 1
|border colour = black
|background colour=white}}

and the explicit matrix equations in 3d are:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{x}}=\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
\bar{x}_1\\
\bar{x}_2\\
\bar{x}_3
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\bar{\mathbf{e}}_1\cdot\mathbf{e}_1 &amp; \bar{\mathbf{e}}_1\cdot\mathbf{e}_2 &amp; \bar{\mathbf{e}}_1\cdot\mathbf{e}_3\\
\bar{\mathbf{e}}_2\cdot\mathbf{e}_1 &amp; \bar{\mathbf{e}}_2\cdot\mathbf{e}_2 &amp; \bar{\mathbf{e}}_2\cdot\mathbf{e}_3\\
\bar{\mathbf{e}}_3\cdot\mathbf{e}_1 &amp; \bar{\mathbf{e}}_3\cdot\mathbf{e}_2 &amp; \bar{\mathbf{e}}_3\cdot\mathbf{e}_3
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\
x_2\\
x_3
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\cos\theta_{11} &amp; \cos\theta_{12} &amp; \cos\theta_{13}\\
\cos\theta_{21} &amp; \cos\theta_{22} &amp; \cos\theta_{23}\\
\cos\theta_{31} &amp; \cos\theta_{32} &amp; \cos\theta_{33}
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\
x_2\\
x_3
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

similarly for

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1}\bar{\mathbf{x}}=\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{\mathrm{T}}\bar{\mathbf{x}}&lt;/math&gt;

The geometric interpretation is the ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' components equal to the sum of projecting the ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' components onto the ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' axes.

The numbers '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;sdot;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; arranged into a matrix would form a [[symmetric matrix]] (a matrix equal to its own transpose) due to the symmetry in the dot products, in fact it is the [[metric tensor]] '''g'''. By contrast '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;sdot;{{overline|'''e'''}}&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; or {{overline|'''e'''}}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;sdot;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; do ''not'' form symmetric matrices in general, as displayed above. Therefore, while the '''L''' matrices are still orthogonal, they are not symmetric.

Apart from a rotation about any one axis, in which the ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for some ''i'' coincide, the angles are not the same as [[Euler angle]]s, and so the '''L''' matrices are not the same as the [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]].

==Transformation of the dot and cross products (three dimensions only)==

The [[dot product]] and [[cross product]] occur very frequently, in applications of vector analysis to physics and engineering, examples include:

*[[power (physics)|power]] transferred ''P'' by an object exerting a force '''F''' with velocity '''v''' along a straight-line path: 
::&lt;math&gt;P = \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt;
*tangential [[velocity]] '''v''' at a point '''x''' of a rotating [[rigid body]] with [[angular velocity]] '''ω''': 
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;
*[[potential energy]] ''U'' of a [[magnetic dipole]] of [[magnetic moment]] '''m''' in a uniform external [[magnetic field]] '''B''': 
::&lt;math&gt;U=-\mathbf{m}\cdot\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;
*[[angular momentum]] '''J''' for a particle with [[position vector]] '''r''' and [[momentum]] '''p''': 
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{r}\times \mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;
*[[torque]] '''τ''' acting on an [[electric dipole]] of [[electric dipole moment]] '''p''' in a uniform external [[electric field]] '''E''': 
::&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{p}\times\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt;
*induced surface [[current density]] '''j'''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; in a magnetic material of [[magnetization]] '''M''' on a surface with [[unit normal]] '''n''': 
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j}_\mathrm{S} = \mathbf{M} \times \mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;

How these products transform under orthogonal transformations is illustrated below.

===Dot product, Kronecker delta, and metric tensor===

The [[dot product]] &amp;sdot; of each possible pairing of the basis vectors follows from the basis being orthonormal. For perpendicular pairs we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{cccc}
\mathbf{e}_\text{x}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{y} &amp; = \mathbf{e}_\text{y}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{z} &amp; =\mathbf{e}_\text{z}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{x}\\
\mathbf{e}_\text{y}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{x} &amp; =\mathbf{e}_\text{z}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{y} &amp; =\mathbf{e}_\text{x}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{z} &amp; =0
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

while for parallel pairs we have

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_\text{x}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{x}=\mathbf{e}_\text{y}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{y}=\mathbf{e}_\text{z}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{z}=1 .&lt;/math&gt;

Replacing Cartesian labels by index notation as shown [[#indices replace labels|above]], these results can be summarized by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i\cdot\mathbf{e}_j = \delta_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''δ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the components of the [[Kronecker delta]]. The Cartesian basis can be used to represent ''δ'' in this way.

In addition, each [[metric tensor]] component ''g&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' with respect to any basis is the dot product of a pairing of basis vectors:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij} = \mathbf{e}_i\cdot\mathbf{e}_j .&lt;/math&gt;

For the Cartesian basis the components arranged into a matrix are:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g} = \begin{pmatrix} 
g_\text{xx} &amp; g_\text{xy} &amp; g_\text{xz} \\
g_\text{yx} &amp; g_\text{yy} &amp; g_\text{zz} \\
g_\text{zx} &amp; g_\text{zy} &amp; g_\text{zz} \\
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 
\mathbf{e}_\text{x}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{x} &amp; \mathbf{e}_\text{x}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{y} &amp; \mathbf{e}_\text{x}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{z} \\
\mathbf{e}_\text{y}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{x} &amp; \mathbf{e}_\text{y}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{y} &amp; \mathbf{e}_\text{y}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{z} \\
\mathbf{e}_\text{z}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{x} &amp; \mathbf{e}_\text{z}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{y} &amp; \mathbf{e}_\text{z}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{z} \\
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

so are the simplest possible for the metric tensor, namely the [[identity matrix|''δ'']]:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij} = \delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

This is ''not'' true for general bases: [[orthogonal coordinates]] have [[diagonal matrix|diagonal]] metrics containing various scale factors (i.e. not necessarily 1), while general [[curvilinear coordinates]] could also have nonzero entries for off-diagonal components.

The dot product of two vectors '''a''' and '''b''' transforms according to

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} = \bar{a}_j \bar{b}_j = a_i \mathsf{L}_{ij} b_k(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{jk} = a_i \delta_i{}_k b_k = a_i b_i &lt;/math&gt;

which is intuitive, since the dot product of two vectors is a single scalar independent of any coordinates. This also applies more generally to any coordinate systems, not just rectangular ones; the dot product in one coordinate system is the same in any other.

===Cross and product, Levi-Civita symbol, and pseudovectors===

For the [[cross product]] × of two vectors, the results are (almost) the other way round. Again, assuming a right-handed 3d Cartesian coordinate system, [[cyclic permutation]]s in perpendicular directions yield the next vector in the cyclic collection of vectors:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_\text{x}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{y} = \mathbf{e}_\text{z}\,\quad \mathbf{e}_\text{y}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{z} = \mathbf{e}_\text{x}\,\quad \mathbf{e}_\text{z}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{x} = \mathbf{e}_\text{y}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_\text{y}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{x} = - \mathbf{e}_\text{z}\,\quad \mathbf{e}_\text{z}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{y} = -\mathbf{e}_\text{x}\,\quad \mathbf{e}_\text{x}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{z} = -\mathbf{e}_\text{y}&lt;/math&gt;

while parallel vectors clearly vanish:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_\text{x}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{x}=\mathbf{e}_\text{y}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{y}=\mathbf{e}_\text{z}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{z} = \boldsymbol{0}&lt;/math&gt;

and replacing Cartesian labels by index notation as [[#indices replace labels|above]], these can be summarized by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i\times\mathbf{e}_j=\left [ \begin{array}{cc}
+\mathbf{e}_k &amp; \text{cyclic permutations: } (i,j,k) = (1,2,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2) \\
-\mathbf{e}_k &amp; \text{anticyclic permutations: } (i,j,k) = (2,1,3), (3,2,1), (1,3,2) \\
\boldsymbol{0} &amp; i=j
\end{array}\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'', ''j'', ''k'' are indices which take values 1, 2, 3. It follows that:

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{e}_k\cdot\mathbf{e}_i\times\mathbf{e}_j}=\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
+1 &amp; \text{cyclic permutations: } (i,j,k) = (1,2,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2) \\
-1 &amp; \text{anticyclic permutations: } (i,j,k) = (2,1,3), (3,2,1), (1,3,2) \\
0 &amp; i=j\text{ or }j=k\text{ or }k=i
\end{array}\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

These permutation relations and their corresponding values are important, and there is an object coinciding with this property: the [[Levi-Civita symbol]], denoted by ''ε''. The Levi-Civita symbol entries can be represented by the Cartesian basis:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ijk} = \mathbf{e}_i\cdot \mathbf{e}_j\times\mathbf{e}_k&lt;/math&gt;

which geometrically corresponds to the [[volume]] of a [[cube]] spanned by the orthonormal basis vectors, with sign indicating [[orientation (vector space)|orientation]] (and ''not'' a "positive or negative volume"). Here, the orientation is fixed by ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;123&lt;/sub&gt; = +1, for a right-handed system. A left-handed system would fix ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;123&lt;/sub&gt; = −1 or equivalently ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;321&lt;/sub&gt; = +1.

The [[scalar triple product]] can now be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = c_i\mathbf{e}_i \cdot a_j\mathbf{e}_j \times b_k\mathbf{e}_k = \varepsilon_{ijk} c_i a_j b_k  &lt;/math&gt;

with the geometric interpretation of volume (of the [[parallelepiped]] spanned by '''a''', '''b''', '''c''') and algebraically is a [[determinant]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|edition=2nd|author1=M. R. Spiegel |author2=S. Lipcshutz |author3=D. Spellman | title=Vector analysis| series=Schaum’s Outlines|publisher=McGraw Hill |page=23|year=2009 | isbn=978-0-07-161545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{vmatrix} c_\text{x} &amp; a_\text{x} &amp; b_\text{x} \\ c_\text{y} &amp; a_\text{y} &amp; b_\text{y} \\ c_\text{z} &amp; a_\text{z} &amp; b_\text{z} \end{vmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

This in turn can be used to rewrite the [[cross product]] of two vectors as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{ll}
&amp; (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b})_i = {\mathbf{e}_i \cdot \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}} = \varepsilon_{\ell jk} {(\mathbf{e}_i)}_\ell a_j b_k = \varepsilon_{\ell jk} \delta_{i \ell} a_j b_k = \varepsilon_{ijk} a_j b_k \\
\Rightarrow &amp; {\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}} = (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b})_i \mathbf{e}_i = \varepsilon_{ijk} a_j b_k \mathbf{e}_i 
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Contrary to its appearance, the Levi-Civita symbol is ''not a tensor'', but a [[pseudotensor]], the components transform according to:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\varepsilon}_{pqr} = \det(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}) \varepsilon_{ijk} \mathsf{L}_{ip}\mathsf{L}_{jq}\mathsf{L}_{kr} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the transformation of the cross product of '''a''' and '''b''' is:
&lt;!---PLEASE LEAVE THE SPACES \;\; FOR CLARITY, AND LEAVE IN ALL THE STEPS - CLARITY IS NOT "TEXTBOOKY" - THANKS---&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(\bar{\mathbf{a}} \times \bar{\mathbf{b}})_i &amp; = \bar{\varepsilon}_{ijk} \bar{a}_j \bar{b}_k \\
&amp; = \det(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}) \;\; \varepsilon_{pqr} \mathsf{L}_{pi}\mathsf{L}_{qj} \mathsf{L}_{rk} \;\; a_m \mathsf{L}_{mj} \;\; b_n \mathsf{L}_{nk} \\
&amp; = \det(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}) \;\; \varepsilon_{pqr} \;\; \mathsf{L}_{pi} \;\; \mathsf{L}_{qj} (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{jm} \;\; \mathsf{L}_{rk} (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{kn} \;\; a_m \;\; b_n \\
&amp; = \det(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}) \;\; \varepsilon_{pqr} \;\; \mathsf{L}_{pi}  \;\;  \delta_{qm} \;\; \delta_{rn} \;\; a_m \;\; b_n \\
&amp; = \det(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}) \;\; \mathsf{L}_{pi}  \;\;  \varepsilon_{pqr} a_q b_r \\
&amp; = \det(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}) \;\; (\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b})_p  \mathsf{L}_{pi}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and so '''a''' × '''b''' transforms as a [[pseudovector]], because of the determinant factor.

The [[tensor index notation]] applies to any object which has entities that form [[multidimensional array]]s – not everything with indices is a tensor by default. Instead, tensors are defined by how their coordinates and basis elements change under a transformation from one coordinate system to another.

Note the cross product of two vectors is a pseudovector, while the cross product of a pseudovector with a vector is another vector.

===Applications of the ''δ'' tensor and ''ε'' pseudotensor===

Other identities can be formed from the ''δ'' tensor and ''ε'' pseudotensor, a notable and very useful identity is one that converts two Levi-Civita symbols adjacently contracted over two indices into an antisymmetrized combination of Kronecker deltas:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ijk}\varepsilon_{pqk} = \delta_{ip}\delta_{jq} - \delta_{iq}\delta_{jp} &lt;/math&gt;

The index forms of the dot and cross products, together with this identity, greatly facilitate the manipulation and derivation of other [[vector calculus identities|identities in vector calculus]] and algebra, which in turn are used extensively in physics and engineering. For instance, it is clear the dot and cross products are distributive over vector addition:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot(\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} ) =  a_i ( b_i + c_i ) =  a_i b_i + a_i c_i = \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{c} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}\times(\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c}) = \mathbf{e}_i\varepsilon_{ijk} a_j ( b_k + c_k ) = \mathbf{e}_i \varepsilon_{ijk} a_j b_k + \mathbf{e}_i \varepsilon_{ijk} a_j c_k = \mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{c}&lt;/math&gt;

without resort to any geometric constructions - the derivation in each case is a quick line of algebra. Although the procedure is less obvious, the vector triple product can also be derived. Rewriting in index notation:

:&lt;math&gt; \left[ \mathbf{a}\times(\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{c})\right]_i = \varepsilon_{ijk} a_j ( \varepsilon_{k \ell m} b_\ell c_m ) = (\varepsilon_{ijk} \varepsilon_{k \ell m} ) a_j b_\ell c_m &lt;/math&gt;

and because cyclic permutations of indices in the ''ε'' symbol does not change its value, cyclically permuting indices in ''ε&lt;sub&gt;k{{ell}}m&lt;/sub&gt;'' to obtain ''ε&lt;sub&gt;{{ell}}mk&lt;/sub&gt;'' allows us to use the above ''δ''-''ε'' identity to convert the ''ε'' symbols into ''δ'' tensors:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\left[ \mathbf{a}\times(\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{c})\right]_i &amp; = ( \delta_{i\ell} \delta_{jm} - \delta_{im} \delta_{j\ell} ) a_j b_\ell c_m \\
&amp; = \delta_{i\ell} \delta_{jm} a_j b_\ell c_m - \delta_{im} \delta_{j\ell} a_j b_\ell c_m \\ 
&amp; = a_j b_i c_j -  a_j b_j c_i \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

thusly:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\times(\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{c}) = (\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{c})\mathbf{b} -  (\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b})\mathbf{c}&lt;/math&gt;

Note this is antisymmetric in '''b''' and '''c''', as expected from the left hand side. Similarly, via index notation or even just cyclically relabelling '''a''', '''b''', and '''c''' in the previous result and taking the negative:

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{a}\times \mathbf{b})\times\mathbf{c} = (\mathbf{c}\cdot\mathbf{a})\mathbf{b} - (\mathbf{c}\cdot\mathbf{b})\mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt;

and the difference in results show that the cross product is not associative. More complex identities, like quadruple products;

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{a}\times \mathbf{b})\cdot(\mathbf{c}\times\mathbf{d}), \quad (\mathbf{a}\times \mathbf{b})\times(\mathbf{c}\times\mathbf{d}) ,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

and so on, can be derived in a similar manner.

==Transformations of Cartesian tensors (any number of dimensions)==

Tensors are defined as quantities which transform in a certain way under linear transformations of coordinates.

===Second order===
Text below contradics introduced above contravariant and covariant vectors (tensors)

Let '''a''' = ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''b''' = ''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be two vectors, so that they transform according to ''{{overline|a}}&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''{{overline|b}}&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''.

Taking the tensor product gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}=a_i\mathbf{e}_i\otimes b_j\mathbf{e}_j=a_i b_j\mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_j&lt;/math&gt;

then applying the transformation to the components

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{a}_p\bar{b}_q= a_i \mathsf{L}_i{}_p b_j \mathsf{L}_j{}_q = \mathsf{L}_i{}_p\mathsf{L}_j{}_q a_i b_j &lt;/math&gt;

and to the bases

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{e}}_p\otimes\bar{\mathbf{e}}_q = (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{pi}\mathbf{e}_i\otimes(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{qj}\bar{\mathbf{e}}_j = (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{pi}(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{qj}\mathbf{e}_i\otimes\bar{\mathbf{e}}_j = \mathsf{L}_{ip} \mathsf{L}_{jq} \mathbf{e}_i\otimes\bar{\mathbf{e}}_j&lt;/math&gt;

gives the transformation law of an order-2 tensor. The tensor '''a'''&amp;otimes;'''b''' is invariant under this transformation:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{cl}
\bar{a}_p\bar{b}_q\bar{\mathbf{e}}_p\otimes\bar{\mathbf{e}}_q &amp; = \mathsf{L}_{kp} \mathsf{L}_{\ell q} a_k b_{\ell} \, (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{pi} (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{qj} \mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_j \\
 &amp; = \mathsf{L}_{kp} (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{pi} \mathsf{L}_{\ell q} (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{q j} \, a_k b_{\ell} \mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_j \\
 &amp; = \delta_k{}_i \delta_{\ell j}  \, a_k b_{\ell} \mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_j \\
 &amp; = a_ib_j\mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_j
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, for any order-2 tensor

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}=R_{ij}\mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_j\,,&lt;/math&gt;

the components transform according to;

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{R}_{pq}=\mathsf{L}_i{}_p\mathsf{L}_j{}_q R_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;,

and the basis transforms by:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{e}}_p\otimes\bar{\mathbf{e}}_q = (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{ip}\mathbf{e}_i\otimes (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{jq}\mathbf{e}_j&lt;/math&gt;

If '''R''' does not transform according to this rule - whatever quantity '''R''' may be, it's not an order 2 tensor.

===Any order===

More generally, for any order ''p'' tensor

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = T_{j_1 j_2 \cdots j_p} \mathbf{e}_{j_1}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j_2}\otimes\cdots\mathbf{e}_{j_p}&lt;/math&gt;

the components transform according to;

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{T}_{j_1j_2\cdots j_p} = \mathsf{L}_{i_1 j_1} \mathsf{L}_{i_2 j_2}\cdots \mathsf{L}_{i_p j_p} T_{i_1 i_2\cdots i_p}&lt;/math&gt;

and the basis transforms by:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{e}}_{j_1}\otimes\bar{\mathbf{e}}_{j_2}\cdots\otimes\bar{\mathbf{e}}_{j_p}=(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{j_1 i_1}\mathbf{e}_{i_1}\otimes(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{j_2 i_2}\mathbf{e}_{i_2}\cdots\otimes(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{j_p i_p}\mathbf{e}_{i_p}&lt;/math&gt;

For a [[pseudotensor]] '''S''' of order ''p'', the components transform according to;

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{S}_{j_1j_2\cdots j_p} = \det(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}) \mathsf{L}_{i_1 j_1} \mathsf{L}_{i_2 j_2}\cdots \mathsf{L}_{i_p j_p} S_{i_1 i_2\cdots i_p}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Pseudovectors as antisymmetric second order tensors==

The antisymmetric nature of the cross product can be recast into a tensorial form as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=classical mechanics|year=1973|publisher=McGraw Hill|edition=2nd|series=European physics series|pages=234–235|author=T. W. B. Kibble|isbn=978-0-07-084018-8}}, see Appendix C.&lt;/ref&gt; Let '''c''' be a vector, '''a''' be a pseudovector, '''b''' be another vector, and '''T''' be a second order tensor such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{T}\cdot\mathbf{b} &lt;/math&gt;

As the cross product is linear in '''a''' and '''b''', the components of '''T''' can be found by inspection, and they are:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; - a_\text{z} &amp; a_\text{y} \\
a_\text{z} &amp; 0 &amp; - a_\text{x} \\
- a_\text{y} &amp; a_\text{x} &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

so the pseudovector '''a''' can be written as an antisymmetric tensor. This transforms as a tensor, not a pseudotensor. For the mechanical example above for the tangential velocity of a rigid body, given by {{nowrap|'''v''' {{=}} '''ω''' × '''x'''}}, this can be rewritten as {{nowrap|'''v''' {{=}} '''Ω''' · '''x'''}} where '''Ω''' is the tensor corresponding to the pseudovector '''ω''':

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Omega} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; - \omega_\text{z} &amp; \omega_\text{y} \\
\omega_\text{z} &amp; 0 &amp; - \omega_\text{x} \\
- \omega_\text{y} &amp; \omega_\text{x} &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

For an example in [[electromagnetism]], while the [[electric field]] '''E''' is a [[vector field]], the [[magnetic field]] '''B''' is a pseudovector field. These fields are defined from the [[Lorentz force]] for a particle of [[electric charge]] ''q'' traveling at velocity '''v''':

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}) = q(\mathbf{E} - \mathbf{B} \times \mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt;

and considering the second term containing the cross product of a pseudovector '''B''' and velocity vector '''v''', it can be written in matrix form, with '''F''', '''E''', and '''v''' as column vectors and '''B''' as an antisymmetric matrix:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix}
F_\text{x} \\
F_\text{y} \\
F_\text{z} \\
\end{pmatrix} = q\begin{pmatrix}
E_\text{x} \\
E_\text{y} \\
E_\text{z} \\
\end{pmatrix} - q \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; - B_\text{z} &amp; B_\text{y} \\
B_\text{z} &amp; 0 &amp; - B_\text{x} \\
- B_\text{y} &amp; B_\text{x} &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
v_\text{x} \\
v_\text{y} \\
v_\text{z} \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If a pseudovector is explicitly given by a cross product of two vectors (as opposed to entering the cross product with another vector), then such pseudovectors can also be written as antisymmetric tensors of second order, with each entry a component of the cross product. The angular momentum of a classical pointlike particle orbiting about an axis, defined by {{nowrap|'''J''' {{=}} '''x''' × '''p'''}}, is another example of a pseudovector, with corresponding antisymmetric tensor:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; - J_\text{z} &amp; J_\text{y} \\
J_\text{z} &amp; 0 &amp; - J_\text{x} \\
- J_\text{y} &amp; J_\text{x} &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; - (x p_\text{y} - y p_\text{x}) &amp; (z p_\text{x} - x p_\text{z}) \\
(x p_\text{y} - y p_\text{x}) &amp; 0 &amp; - (y p_\text{z} - z p_\text{y}) \\
- (z p_\text{x} - x p_\text{z}) &amp; (y p_\text{z} - z p_\text{y}) &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Although Cartesian tensors do not occur in the theory of relativity; the tensor form of orbital angular momentum '''J''' enters the spacelike part of the [[relativistic angular momentum]] tensor, and the above tensor form of the magnetic field '''B''' enters the spacelike part of the [[electromagnetic tensor]].

==Vector and tensor calculus==

It should be emphasized the following formulae are only so simple in Cartesian coordinates - in general curvilinear coordinates there are factors of the metric and its determinant - see [[tensors in curvilinear coordinates]] for more general analysis.

===Vector calculus===

Following are the differential operators of [[vector calculus]]. Throughout, left Φ('''r''', ''t'') be a [[scalar field]], and

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r},t) = A_\text{x}(\mathbf{r},t)\mathbf{e}_\text{x} + A_\text{y}(\mathbf{r},t)\mathbf{e}_\text{y} + A_\text{z}(\mathbf{r},t)\mathbf{e}_\text{z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r},t) = B_\text{x}(\mathbf{r},t)\mathbf{e}_\text{x} + B_\text{y}(\mathbf{r},t)\mathbf{e}_\text{y} + B_\text{z}(\mathbf{r},t)\mathbf{e}_\text{z}&lt;/math&gt;

be [[vector field]]s, in which all scalar and vector fields are functions of the [[position vector]] '''r''' and time ''t''.

The [[gradient]] operator in Cartesian coordinates is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla = \mathbf{e}_\text{x}\frac{\partial}{\partial x} +  \mathbf{e}_\text{y}\frac{\partial}{\partial y} + \mathbf{e}_\text{z}\frac{\partial}{\partial z} &lt;/math&gt;

and in index notation, this is usually abbreviated in various ways:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_i \equiv \partial_i \equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} &lt;/math&gt;

This operator acts on a scalar field Φ to obtain the vector field directed in the maximum rate of increase of Φ:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\nabla\Phi\right)_i = \nabla_i \Phi &lt;/math&gt;

The index notation for the dot and cross products carries over to the differential operators of vector calculus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|edition=2nd|author1=M. R. Spiegel |author2=S. Lipcshutz |author3=D. Spellman | title=Vector analysis| series=Schaum’s Outlines|publisher=McGraw Hill |page=197| year=2009 | isbn=978-0-07-161545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[directional derivative]] of a scalar field Φ is the rate of change of Φ along some direction vector '''a''' (not necessarily a [[unit vector]]), formed out of the components of '''a''' and the gradient:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot(\nabla\Phi) = a_j (\nabla\Phi)_j &lt;/math&gt;

The [[divergence]] of a vector field '''A''' is:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\mathbf{A} = \nabla_i A_i &lt;/math&gt;

Note the interchange of the components of the gradient and vector field yields a different differential operator

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}\cdot\nabla =  A_i \nabla_i &lt;/math&gt;

which could act on scalar or vector fields. In fact, if '''A''' is replaced by the [[velocity field]] '''u'''('''r''', ''t'') of a fluid, this is a term in the [[material derivative]] (with many other names) of [[continuum mechanics]], with another term being the partial time derivative:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{D}{D t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla&lt;/math&gt;

which usually acts on the velocity field leading to the non-linearity in the [[Navier-Stokes equations]].

As for the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of a vector field '''A''', this can be defined as a pseudovector field by means of the ''ε'' symbol:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\nabla\times\mathbf{A}\right)_i = \varepsilon_{ijk} \nabla_j A_k &lt;/math&gt;

which is only valid in three dimensions, or an antisymmetric tensor field of second order via antisymmetrization of indices, indicated by delimiting the antisymmetrized indices by square brackets (see [[Ricci calculus]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\nabla\times\mathbf{A}\right)_{ij} = \nabla_i A_j - \nabla_j A_i = 2\nabla_{[i} A_{j]}&lt;/math&gt;

which is valid in any number of dimensions. In each case, the order of the gradient and vector field components should not be interchanged as this would result in a different differential operator:

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_{ijk} A_j \nabla_k &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A_i \nabla_j - A_j \nabla_i = 2 A_{[i} \nabla_{j]} &lt;/math&gt;

which could act on scalar or vector fields.

Finally, the [[Laplacian operator]] is defined in two ways, the divergence of the gradient of a scalar field Φ:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot(\nabla \Phi) = \nabla_i (\nabla_i \Phi) &lt;/math&gt;

or the square of the gradient operator, which acts on a scalar field Φ or a vector field '''A''':

:&lt;math&gt;(\nabla\cdot\nabla) \Phi = (\nabla_i \nabla_i) \Phi &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(\nabla\cdot\nabla) \mathbf{A} = (\nabla_i \nabla_i) \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt;

In physics and engineering, the gradient, divergence, curl, and Laplacian operator arise inevitably in [[fluid mechanics]], [[Newtonian gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], [[heat conduction]], and even [[quantum mechanics]].

Vector calculus identities can be derived in a similar way to those of vector dot and cross products and combinations. For example, in three dimensions, the curl of a cross product of two vector fields '''A''' and '''B''':

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left[\nabla\times(\mathbf{A}\times\mathbf{B})\right]_i &amp; = \varepsilon_{ijk} \nabla_j (\varepsilon_{k\ell m} A_\ell B_m) \\
&amp; = (\varepsilon_{ijk} \varepsilon_{\ell m k} ) \nabla_j (A_\ell B_m) \\
&amp; = (\delta_{i\ell}\delta_{jm} - \delta_{im}\delta_{j\ell}) (B_m \nabla_j A_\ell + A_\ell \nabla_j B_m ) \\
&amp; = (B_j \nabla_j A_i  + A_i \nabla_j B_j ) - (B_i \nabla_j A_j + A_j \nabla_j B_i ) \\
&amp; = (B_j \nabla_j)A_i  + A_i(\nabla_j B_j ) - B_i (\nabla_j A_j ) - (A_j \nabla_j) B_i \\
&amp; = \left[(\mathbf{B} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{A}  + \mathbf{A}(\nabla\cdot \mathbf{B}) - \mathbf{B}(\nabla\cdot \mathbf{A} ) - (\mathbf{A}\cdot \nabla) \mathbf{B} \right]_i \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[product rule]] was used, and throughout the differential operator was not interchanged with '''A''' or '''B'''. Thus:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times(\mathbf{A}\times\mathbf{B}) = (\mathbf{B} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{A}  + \mathbf{A}(\nabla\cdot \mathbf{B}) - \mathbf{B}(\nabla\cdot \mathbf{A} ) - (\mathbf{A}\cdot \nabla) \mathbf{B} &lt;/math&gt;

===Tensor calculus===

One can continue the operations on tensors of higher order. Let '''T''' = '''T'''('''r''', ''t'') denote a second order tensor field, again dependent on the position vector '''r''' and time ''t''.

For instance, the gradient of a vector field in two equivalent notations ("dyadic" and "tensor", respectively) is:

:&lt;math&gt;(\nabla \mathbf{A})_{ij} \equiv (\nabla \otimes \mathbf{A})_{ij} = \nabla_i A_j &lt;/math&gt;

which is a tensor field of second order.

The divergence of a tensor is:

:&lt;math&gt;(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{T})_j = \nabla_i T_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;

which is a vector field. This arises in continuum mechanics in [[Continuum mechanics#Governing equations|Cauchy's laws of motion]] - the divergence of the Cauchy stress tensor '''σ''' is a vector field, related to [[body force]]s acting on the fluid.

==Difference from the standard tensor calculus==

Cartesian tensors are as in [[tensor algebra]], but [[Euclidean space#Euclidean structure|Euclidean structure]] of and restriction of the basis brings some simplifications compared to the general theory.

The general tensor algebra consists of general [[mixed tensor]]s of type (''p'', ''q''):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = T_{j_1 j_2 \cdots j_q}^{i_1 i_2 \cdots i_p} \mathbf{e}_{i_1 i_2 \cdots i_p}^{j_1 j_2 \cdots j_q} &lt;/math&gt;

with basis elements:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_{i_1 i_2 \cdots i_p}^{j_1 j_2 \cdots j_q} = \mathbf{e}_{i_1}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{i_2}\otimes\cdots\mathbf{e}_{i_p}\otimes\mathbf{e}^{j_1}\otimes\mathbf{e}^{j_2}\otimes\cdots\mathbf{e}^{j_q}&lt;/math&gt;

the components transform according to:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{T}_{\ell_1 \ell_2 \cdots \ell_q}^{k_1 k_2 \cdots k_p} = \mathsf{L}_{i_1}{}^{k_1} \mathsf{L}_{i_2}{}^{k_2} \cdots \mathsf{L}_{i_p}{}^{k_p} (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{\ell_1}{}^{j_1}(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{\ell_2}{}^{j_2} \cdots (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{\ell_q}{}^{j_q} T_{j_1 j_2 \cdots j_q}^{i_1 i_2 \cdots i_p}&lt;/math&gt;

as for the bases:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{e}}_{k_1 k_2 \cdots k_p}^{\ell_1 \ell_2 \cdots \ell_q} = (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{k_1}{}^{i_1} (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{k_2}{}^{i_2} \cdots (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{k_p}{}^{i_p} \mathsf{L}_{j_1}{}^{\ell_1} \mathsf{L}_{j_2}{}^{\ell_2} \cdots \mathsf{L}_{j_q}{}^{\ell_q} \mathbf{e}_{i_1 i_2 \cdots i_p}^{j_1 j_2 \cdots j_q}&lt;/math&gt;

For Cartesian tensors, only the order {{nowrap|''p'' + ''q''}} of the tensor matters in a Euclidean space with an orthonormal basis, and all {{nowrap|''p'' + ''q''}} indices can be lowered.  A Cartesian basis does not exist unless the vector space has a positive-definite metric, and thus cannot be used in [[special relativity|relativistic]] contexts.

==History==

[[Dyadic tensor]]s were historically the first approach to formulating second-order tensors, similarly triadic tensors for third-order tensors, and so on. Cartesian tensors use [[tensor index notation]], in which the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|variance]] may be glossed over and is often ignored, since the components remain unchanged by [[raising and lowering indices]].

'''Charles Martin''' (August 31, 1959 – January 26, 2005) was a [[Professional sports|professional]] [[American football]] player, who is best known for his career with the [[Green Bay Packers]], and in particular for causing a season-ending injury to [[Chicago Bears]] [[Starting lineup|starting]] [[quarterback]] [[Jim McMahon]] on November 23, 1986. Martin also played for the [[Birmingham Stallions]] of the [[USFL]], the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] of the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]], and the [[Houston Oilers]] and [[Atlanta Falcons]] in the [[NFL]].

== Early career ==
Martin attended [[Cherokee High School (Georgia)|Cherokee High School]] in [[Canton, Georgia]] and was nicknamed "Too Mean" for his tendency to pile on ball carriers after the whistle.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-02-01/sports/0502010334_1_charles-martin-bears-division-ii-all-american|title=To Bears fans, Charles Martin will always be recalled for the body slam that ended Jim McMahon's season in 1986.

== Professional career ==

=== Birmingham Stallions ===
Martin began his pro football career with the [[Birmingham Stallions]] of the [[USFL]] in 1983, but was cut after his first season.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Edmonton Eskimos ===
Martin was signed by the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] in early 1984 but was cut before he could make it through a season.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Green Bay Packers ===
Martin immediately jumped into a starting role once he was signed by the [[Green Bay Packers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/1985-chicago-bears/1985-bears-coverage-usfl-demise-hurts-bears/|title=1985 Bears Coverage: USFL demise hurts Bears|work=Chicago Sun-Times|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed with the Packers after he was not selected in the Supplemental Draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m9o2_k8zu4QC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=charles+martin+usfl&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JQPQFA7bgQ&amp;sig=1QjiBG2L7KcV9-r9XbTy84VJ1w4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwih2fKUqZnYAhUnzoMKHTx0A2wQ6AEIbDAN#v=onepage&amp;q=charles%20martin%20usfl&amp;f=false|title=Packers by the Numbers: Jersey Numbers and the Players who Wore Them|last=Maxymuk|first=John|date=2003|publisher=Big Earth Publishing|isbn=9781879483903|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== 1986 McMahon incident ====
During pre-game warm-ups, Martin displayed a white hand-towel with a list of five Bears offensive players' numbers: 9 for [[Jim McMahon]], 34 for [[Walter Payton]], 83 for [[Willie Gault]], 63 for [[Jay Hilgenberg]] and 29 for [[Dennis Gentry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/thirty-years-ago-bears-packers-featured-the-dirtiest-hit-in-nfl-history-102016|title=Thirty years ago, Bears-Packers featured the dirtiest hit in NFL history|date=2016-10-20|work=FOX Sports|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin wore the towel during the game. He allegedly claimed that it was a hit-list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scout.com/nfl/packers/Article/Charles-Martin-dead-at-46-104169708|title=Charles Martin dead at 46|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Bears quarterback Jim McMahon threw an [[interception]], Martin grabbed him from behind and body-slammed him shoulder first to the ground. Replays showed that Martin hit McMahon at least two seconds after the pass was thrown, well after McMahon was out of the play. McMahon landed full force on his previously injured shoulder,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; a situation exacerbated by [[Soldier Field]]'s artificial turf surface of the time—and was knocked out for the rest of the season.  Martin was ejected from the game by referee [[Jerry Markbreit]] and suspended for two games.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/26/sports/martin-of-packers-suspended.html | work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Janofsky | title=Martin Of Packers Suspended | date=November 26, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Markbreit later said that Martin complained about the ejection until the threat of letting Bears players come after him was spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/chicago/bears/post/_/id/4675356/the-infamous-hit-from-the-refs-perspective|title=The infamous hit from the ref's perspective|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the game, the Packers defensive coordinator defended Martin, saying "We tell people that if we intercept a pass, go get anybody near you."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=100 Things Packers Fans Should Know and Do Before They Die|last=Reischel|first=Rob|publisher=Triumph Books|year=2010|isbn=978-1-60078-398-2|location=Chicago|pages=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first multi-game suspension for an on-field incident in modern NFL history, and would remain the longest suspension for an on-field incident until [[Albert Haynesworth]] of the [[Tennessee Titans]] was suspended five games for stomping on the head of [[Dallas Cowboys]] [[Center (American football)|center]] [[Andre Gurode]] in [[2006 NFL season|2006]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=2610577|title=Haynesworth penalty comes in: Five games|date=2006-10-02|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin played for the Packers from [[1984 NFL season|1984]]–[[1987 NFL season|1987]]. He was cut early in the 1987 season after being implicated in a Green Bay bar fight.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Houston Oilers ===
Martin played for the [[Houston Oilers|Oilers]] in the latter part of the 1987 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ign.com/boards/threads/former-packer-defensive-end-charles-martin-passes-away.77646003/|title=Former Packer Defensive End Charles Martin passes away.|work=IGN Boards|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a game against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], Martin speared Steelers [[running back]] [[Earnest Jackson]], sparking a rivalry between Oilers coach [[Jerry Glanville]] and Steelers coach [[Chuck Noll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-16/sports/sp-48_1_oiler-linebacker|title=Oilers Try to Make It a Mobile House of Pain|last=WOLF|first=BOB|date=1989-09-16|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-12-21|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atlanta Falcons ===
He closed out his career with the [[Atlanta Falcons|Falcons]] in [[1988 NFL season|1988]], the only season in which he did not start a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MartCh20.htm|title=Charles Martin  Stats {{!}} Pro-Football-Reference.com|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Martin was suspended two games in 1986 due to an incident at a bar. He later went into alcohol abuse treatment, and divorced both of his wives. He was arrested for disorderly conduct in 1987 for throwing an egg at the car of an NFL replacement player.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Martin died in 2005 at age 45 in [[Houston]] due to complications from [[kidney failure]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''climate-friendly school''' is a school that uses [[education for sustainable development]] (ESD) to promote a culture of sustainability in which students, staff and families hold shared values and beliefs about the importance of taking action for a more sustainable society. Taking care of the environment and contributing to reducing [[climate change]] is an integral part of this. [[Climate action]] means different things to different schools. Some schools see climate action as key to “doing their part” to take care of the planet. For other schools, it is about addressing issues directly affecting them. For example, several schools in disaster-prone [[Japan]] see climate action as a practical way of helping students and their families stay safe and prepare for the future.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002467/246740e.pdf|title=Getting Climate-Ready: A Guide for Schools on Climate Action|last=Gibb|first=Natalie|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100193-2|location=|pages=5, 7–8, 10, 15, 18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Whole-school approach to climate action ==
[[File:Figure 1 Whole school approach to climate change Getting Climate-Ready.svg|thumb|The whole-school approach to climate change]]
In a whole-school approach, students’ classroom learning about climate change is reinforced by the formal and informal messages promoted by the school’s values and actions. In other words, students and other members of the school community live what they learn, and learn what they live. The whole-school approach to climate change means that an educational institution includes action for reducing climate change in every aspect of school life. This includes school governance, teaching content and methodology, campus and facilities management as well as cooperation with partners and the broader communities. The active involvement of all internal and external school stakeholders, namely students, teachers, principals, school staff at all levels and the wider school community such as families and community members in reflecting and acting on climate change is key to a whole-school approach.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== 1st Experimental Lyceum of Athens-Gennadeio, Athens, Greece ===
As an experimental school, the 1st Experimental Lyceum of Athens-Gennadeio is encouraged to introduce innovative programmes. In 2013, the school introduced complex systems into biology and chemistry courses for 157 senior secondary students. In the complex systems unit, students worked in groups to investigate climate change, virus transmission, and ecosystem dynamics with the help of computer simulations. Through their investigations, students discovered the properties of complex systems, such as positive and negative [[Feedback|feedback loops]]. They also had opportunities to apply their learning. For example, a group of students measured the energy sustainability of the school building, to find its weaknesses and construct an action plan to improve it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Al-Kawthar Secondary School, Beirut, Lebanon ===
Al-Kawthar Secondary School works to raise awareness of climate change within their school. So far, 2,421 students, 310 teachers, and 110 families have been involved in projects including [[Tree planting|tree-planting]], making handicrafts from recycled materials, visiting national forests, recycling, and conserving water. The school also hosted film nights and workshops where students, families and teachers suggested ways to save the planet. Following the ISO-26000 guidelines for socially responsible institutions, the school has committed to a continuous process of improvement. At the beginning of the school year, the environmental committee develops an action plan based on what was learned and achieved the previous year. The committee keeps a record of their activities, so the school can identify high-impact activities and activities that could be scaled up. Teachers and students deepen their learning by sharing their experiences with other schools in [[Lebanon]] and around the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ASPnet Schools, Côte d’Ivoire ===
In [[Ivory Coast|Côte d'Ivoire]], one of the most widespread uses of forest resources is in [[traditional medicine]] which is of vital importance with regard to primary health care and contributes to preserving traditional knowledge and cultural heritage. Realizing that the biodiversity of their forests is under threat, the [[UNESCO ASPNet|ASPnet]] schools, together with university researchers and medical practitioners, united their forces to come to the rescue of the forest resources in Côte d'Ivoire. The schools promote botanical gardens where parents as well as traditional medicine practitioners teach students how to conserve and manage forest resources in a more sustainable way. Through the study visits in the botanical garden, students acquire traditional knowledge of medicinal plant cultivation which will enable them to identify, protect, preserve and promote the medicinal plants which have tremendous ecological and cultural importance in Côte d'Ivoire. In collaboration with the experts and researchers, the ASPnet schools are now considering creating a genebank as well as replanting endangered species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Colégio Israelita Brasileiro A. Liessen, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil ===
Colégio Israelita Brasileiro A. Liessen's environment team has invited janitors, teachers, students, engineers and others to participate in experiential, non-formal learning activities. They created a [[green roof]], built [[Solar cooker|solar ovens]] and bamboo bicycle racks, planted spice, flower, and meditation gardens, and converted used cooking oil into [[biodiesel]]. These activities have created bonds between different members of the school community, awakened a sense of belonging and pride in the school, and built an environment where ideas and information are shared freely. The environment team has also offered trainings for school community members in order to secure buy-in for the projects. For example, training on waste sorting and cooking oil collection was offered to employees. Also, a gardening workshop was organized for student volunteers, so they could assist maintenance staff in caring for the expanding school gardens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Endrupskolen School, Fredensborg, Denmark ===
Thanks to a partnership with a local non-profit organization, Endrupskolen School offers students inspiring and hands-on learning experiences. Eight times throughout the school year, students visit gardens, farms and kitchens run by the non-profit organization “Haver til Maver.” During each visit, classes meet experts such as farmers, cooks, biologists or gardeners who guide students in exploring plants, trees, vegetables, smells and tastes. According to Endrupskolen teachers, these visits have given students the skills and commitment needed to build better food futures for themselves, their families and society as a whole. In addition, learning outside the traditional classroom has helped students develop better relationships with their peers and a better sense of self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Nagoya International School, Nagoya, Japan ===
The [[Nagoya International School]] is committed to developing a school culture of sustainability, as expressed in their school mission statement. The institution aims to “nurture in its students the capacity to objectively define what is truly needed in the global society, to take action on their own, and to become active agents for [[sustainable development]].”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation, Japan (and global) ===
'''Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation''' is an education-services organization that provides capstone education programs free of charge to engineering students and other stakeholders. These programs are intended to complement—but not to replace—coursework required by academic degree programs of study. The programs are educational opportunities, and students are not paid money for their participation. All correspondence among members is completed via e-mail, and all meetings are held via Skype, with English as the language of instruction and publication. Students and other stakeholders are never asked to travel or leave their geographic locations, and are encouraged to publish organizational documents in their personal, primary languages, when English is a secondary language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5084">In [[mathematics]], a '''composition ring''', introduced in {{harv|Adler|1962}}, is a [[commutative ring]] (''R'', 0,  +, &amp;minus;, ·), possibly without an identity 1 (see [[non-unital ring]]), together with an operation

: &lt;math&gt;\circ: R \times R \rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt;

such that, for any three elements &lt;math&gt;f,g,h\in R&lt;/math&gt; one has

# &lt;math&gt;(f+g)\circ h=(f\circ h)+(g\circ h)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;(f\cdot g)\circ h = (f\circ h)\cdot (g\circ h)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)\circ h = f\circ  (g\circ h).&lt;/math&gt;

It is ''not'' generally the case that &lt;math&gt;f\circ g=g\circ f&lt;/math&gt;, ''nor'' is it generally the case that &lt;math&gt;f\circ (g+h)&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;f\circ (g\cdot h)&lt;/math&gt;) has any algebraic relationship to &lt;math&gt;f\circ g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f\circ h&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==

There are a few ways to make a commutative ring ''R'' into a composition ring without introducing anything new.
*Composition may be defined by &lt;math&gt;f\circ g=0&lt;/math&gt; for all ''f'',''g''. The resulting composition ring is a rather uninteresting.
*Composition may be defined by &lt;math&gt;f\circ g=f&lt;/math&gt; for all ''f'',''g''. This is the composition rule for constant functions.
*If ''R'' is a [[boolean ring]], then multiplication may double as composition: &lt;math&gt;f\circ g=fg&lt;/math&gt; for all ''f'',''g''.
More interesting examples can be formed by defining a composition on another ring constructed from ''R''.
*The polynomial ring ''R''[''X''] is a composition ring where &lt;math&gt;(f\circ g) (x)=f(g(x))&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;f, g \in R&lt;/math&gt;.
*The formal power series ring ''R''{{brackets|''X''}} also has a substitution operation, but it is only defined if the series ''g'' being substituted has zero constant term (if not, the constant term of the result would be given by an infinite series with arbitrary coefficients). Therefore, the subset of ''R''{{brackets|''X''}} formed by power series with zero constant coefficient can be made into a composition ring with composition given by the same substitution rule as for polynomials. Since nonzero constant series are absent, this composition ring does not have a multiplicative unit.
*If ''R'' is an integral domain, the field ''R''(''X'') of rational functions also has a substitution operation derived from that of polynomials: substituting a fraction ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for ''X'' into a polynomial of degree ''n'' gives a rational function with denominator &lt;math&gt;g_2^n&lt;/math&gt;, and substituting into a fraction is given by
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{f_1}{f_2}\circ g=\frac{f_1\circ g}{f_2\circ g}.&lt;/math&gt;
:However, as for formal power series, the composition cannot always be defined when the right operand ''g'' is a constant: in the formula given the denominator &lt;math&gt;f_2\circ g&lt;/math&gt; should not be identically zero. One must therefore restrict to a subring of ''R''(''X'') to have a well-defined composition operation; a suitable subring is given by the rational functions of which the numerator has zero constant term, but the denominator has nonzero constant term. Again this composition ring has no multiplicative unit; if ''R'' is a field, it is in fact a subring of the formal power series example.
*The set of all functions from ''R'' to ''R'' under pointwise addition and multiplication, and with &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; given by composition of functions, is a composition ring. There are numerous variations of this idea, such as the ring of continuous, smooth, holomorphic, or polynomial functions from a ring to itself, when these concepts makes sense.

For a concrete example take the ring &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb Z}[x]&lt;/math&gt;, considered as the ring of polynomial maps from the integers to itself.  A ring endomorphism
: &lt;math&gt;F:{\mathbb Z}[x]\rightarrow{\mathbb Z}[x]&lt;/math&gt;
of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb Z}[x]&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the image under &lt;math&gt; F&lt;/math&gt; of the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, which we denote by
: &lt;math&gt;f=F(x)&lt;/math&gt;
and this image &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; can be any element of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb Z}[x]&lt;/math&gt;.    Therefore, one may consider the elements &lt;math&gt;f\in{\mathbb Z}[x]&lt;/math&gt; as endomorphisms and assign &lt;math&gt;\circ:{\mathbb Z}[x]\times{\mathbb Z}[x]\rightarrow{\mathbb Z}[x]&lt;/math&gt;, accordingly.  One easily verifies that &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb Z}[x]&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the above axioms.  &lt;!-- Is &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb Z}[x]&lt;/math&gt;  the free composition ring on one generator?--&gt; For example, one has
: &lt;math&gt;(x^2+3x+5)\circ(x-2)=(x-2)^2+3(x-2)+5=x^2-x+3.&lt;/math&gt;
This example is isomorphic to the given example for ''R''[''X''] with ''R'' equal to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt;, and also to the subring of all functions &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z\to\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; formed by the polynomial functions.

'''Domestic violence in same-sex relationships''' is a pattern of violence or abuse that occurs within same-sex relationships.

===General===
The ''Encyclopedia of Victimology and Crime Prevention'' states, "For several methodological reasons&amp;nbsp;– nonrandom sampling procedures and self-selection factors, among others&amp;nbsp;– it is not possible to assess the extent of same-sex domestic violence. Studies on abuse between gay male or lesbian partners usually rely on small convenience samples such as lesbian or gay male members of an association."&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;{{cite book| authors=Bonnie S. Fisher, Steven P.

===Gay males and lesbians===
{{further information|Domestic violence#Same-sex relationships|Domestic violence in lesbian relationships}}
Some sources state that [[Human male sexuality|gay]] and [[lesbian]] couples experience domestic violence at the same frequency as [[heterosexual]] couples,&lt;ref name="Karmen"&gt;{{cite book| author=Andrew Karmen| title = Crime Victims: An Introduction to Victimology| publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2010|page=255|accessdate = August 19, 2014| isbn = 0495599298 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=yb4Nkeks15AC&amp;pg=PA255}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other sources state domestic violence among gay, lesbian, and [[bisexual]] individuals might be higher than among heterosexual individuals, that gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals are less likely to report domestic violence that has occurred in their intimate relationships than heterosexual couples are, or that lesbian couples experience domestic violence less than heterosexual couples do.&lt;ref name="Hampton"&gt;{{cite book| authors=Robert L. Hampton, Thomas P. Gullotta| title = Interpersonal Violence in the African-American Community: Evidence-Based Prevention and Treatment Practices| publisher =[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]]|year = 2010|page=49|accessdate = August 19, 2014| isbn = 0387295984 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=IAG1R-ZMmkYC&amp;pg=PA49}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, some researchers commonly assume that lesbian couples experience domestic violence at the same rate as heterosexual couples, and have been more cautious when reporting domestic violence among gay male couples.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt; According to a 2012 report from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP) of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and HIV-Affected Intimate Partner Violence Gay men were more likely to require medical attention and suffer injuries as a result of IPV. Gay men were close to two times (1.7) more likely to require medical attention and 16 times more likely to suffer injury as compared to individuals who did not identify as gay men.&lt;ref&gt; "Who is Doing What to Whom? Determining the Core Aggressor in Relationships Where Domestic Violence Exists." National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. https://www.speakcdn.com/assets/2497/who_is_doing_what_to_whom.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 review of the literature found that rates of domestic violence among same-sex couples are similar to or greater than opposite-sexed couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stiles-Shields |first1=C |last2=Carroll |first2=RA |title=Same-Sex Domestic Violence: Prevalence, Unique Aspects, and Clinical Implications. |journal=Journal of sex &amp; marital therapy |date=2015 |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=636-48 |doi=10.1080/0092623X.2014.958792 |pmid=25189218}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In a 2010 [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) study, reporting on domestic violence in the U.S., 26% of gay men said that they experienced [[physical violence]], [[stalking]], or [[rape]] by their partners.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Walters, Mikel L., Jieru Chen, and Matthew J. Breiding. "The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS): 2010 findings on victimization by sexual orientation." Atlanta, GA: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 648, no. 73 (2013): 6.&lt;/ref&gt; 29% of heterosexual men reported similar violence in the same study.

The CDC also stated that 40% of lesbian women reported physical violence by their partners, and 44% reported experiencing physical violence, stalking, or rape by their partners. In contrast, 35% of heterosexual women reported physical violence, stalking, or rape by their partners in the same study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Literature on intimate partner violence (IPV) among same-gender female couples, researchers found that internalized homophobia and discrimination were correlated with IPV.&lt;ref&gt;[[cite url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-6402.2005.00220.x&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, research done on psychological aggression of lesbian relationships, researchers found that internalized homophobia and social constraints in talking with friends about sexual identity issues showed correlation with IPV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0361684313517866 | volume=38 | title=Sexual Minority Stressors and Psychological Aggression in Lesbian Women’s Intimate Relationships | year=2014 | journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly | pages=535–550 | last1 = Lewis | first1 = Robin J. | last2 = Milletich | first2 = Robert J. | last3 = Derlega | first3 = Valerian J. | last4 = Padilla | first4 = Miguel A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literature on intimate partner violence (IPV) among same-gender male couples, SES, attachment orientation, HIV status, and public outness, and internalized homophobia showed relationship with intimate partner violence in gay men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1891/0886-6708.23.3.344 | volume=23 | title=Correlates of Partner Abuse in Male Same-Sex Relationships | year=2008 | journal=Violence and Victims | pages=344–360 | last1 = Bartholomew | first1 = Kim | last2 = Regan | first2 = Katherine V. | last3 = Oram | first3 = Doug | last4 = White | first4 = Monica A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a study conducted on the predictors of IPA of gay men found a correlation between public outness, alcohol consumption, and internalized homophobia &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10896-014-9620-7 | volume=29 | title=Predictors of Women’s Same-Sex Partner Violence Perpetration | year=2014 | journal=Journal of Family Violence | pages=653–664 | last1 = Milletich | first1 = Robert J. | last2 = Gumienny | first2 = Leslie A. | last3 = Kelley | first3 = Michelle L. | last4 = D'Lima | first4 = Gabrielle M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bisexual===
Although [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] people may be in relationships with people of any gender, they are often victims of domestic violence. The CDC reported that 61% of bisexual women said they experienced physical violence, stalking, or rape by their partners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For men in the same study, 37% reported having experienced similar violence.

For both men and women, the percentage of bisexual people who have experienced domestic violence is higher than either gay men or lesbians. The high rate of domestic violence faced by bisexual people may be in part because of the [[Biphobia|specific challenges bisexual people face]] in receiving help, as bisexuality is often misunderstood, even by those who administer domestic violence help professionally.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Transgender===
[[Transgender]] people may be in relationships with people of any gender, but they experience high rates of domestic violence. Comparatively, little research has been conducted on domestic violence towards transgender individuals, especially within the context of romantic relationships. In a 2009 United States study, 56% to 66% of transgender individuals reported experiencing violence within their homes, though not necessarily by a romantic partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stotzer | first1 = Rebecca L | year = 2009 | title = Violence against transgender people: A review of United States data | url = | journal = Aggression and Violent Behavior | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 170–179 | doi=10.1016/j.avb.2009.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences and factors ==

=== Legal issues ===
Members of same-sex relationships who face domestic violence often have issues accessing legal recourse, as domestic violence laws are often drafted in such a way as to only include different sex partnerships.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some are worried about being involved in the legal system because they are afraid they will be mistreated or dismissed due to their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Although often the abuser can still be arrested or tried for [[assault]] or similar crimes, not classifying the crime as domestic may change how it is dealt with in the court system and change how the victim is treated. Also, studies have shown that law enforcement officers do not treat domestic violence in same-sex relationships as seriously as domestic violence in heterosexual relationships.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Victims of domestic violence in same sex relationships do have legal rights afforded to them in some U.S. states, whether or not they are married to their partner, although the requirements and protections vary by state.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Some of these rights include having a [[Injunction|civil protection order]] or [[restraining order]] placed on the abuser to keep them from stalking or harassing the victim.

Some cities and states in the U.S. are working to improve the legal situation for LGBT victims of domestic violence, through policy change and police training.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] the city has created an LGBT unit of their police department to combat [[Violence against LGBT people|homophobic violence]] and to deal with [[Transphobia|violence against transgender people]] by professionals who are also members of the [[LGBT community]].&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mpdc.dc.gov/page/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-liaison-unit-lgbtlu|title=Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Liaison Unit (LGBTLU) {{!}} mpdc|website=mpdc.dc.gov|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/10/06/496404041/for-d-c-s-lgbt-community-a-police-liaison-who-can-relate|title=For D.C.'s LGBT Community, A Police Liaison Who Can Relate|website=NPR.org|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HIV/AIDS ===
[[File:Minnesota AIDS Project - HIV Stigma Stops Here - Twin Cities Pride Parade (9180874836).jpg|thumb|People carry a banner promoting the end of HIV stigma at a [[Pride parade|Pride Parade]]]]

[[HIV/AIDS]] may create additional problems for those in violent relationships, financially, emotionally, and health wise, whether it is the perpetrator or the victim who is living with HIV or AIDS.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncavp.org/issues/DomesticViolence.aspx|title=NCAVP :: Issues :: Domestic Violence|website=www.ncavp.org|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This specifically affects those in same-sex relationships because [[men who have sex with men]], no matter how they identity, are significantly more likely to have HIV or AIDS than others.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-social-issues/key-affected-populations/men-sex-men|title=Men who have sex with men, HIV and AIDS {{!}} AVERT|website=www.avert.org|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those living with HIV are often financially dependent on their partners, making it more difficult to leave abusive relationships.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If it is the victim who has HIV or AIDS the abuser may take control of their finances in order to have even more control over their life.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This issue is compounded by the fact that those living with HIV or AIDS may often become too sick to work and support themselves, and that even when they are able to work they often face [[discrimination]] in the workplace or in the hiring process, even though this is technically illegal under the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/resources/hiv-aids-and-employment-discrimination|title=HIV &amp; AIDS and Employment Discrimination {{!}} Human Rights Campaign|last=Campaign|first=Human Rights|website=Human Rights Campaign|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abusers may use emotional tactics to exert control over their partners, whether it is them or the victim who has HIV or AIDS.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Some abusive partners may threaten to reveal their partner's positive [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|HIV status]] to others as a form of control, as there is a [[Discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS|stigma surrounding HIV and AIDS]] that could affect a victim's life.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; If it is the abuser who has HIV or AIDS, the victim may fear that leaving someone who is sick makes them seem shallow, uncaring, or discriminatory, or the abuser may insinuate that if their partner leaves the relationship the abuser will become sicker as a result.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Oppositionally, if it is the victim who has HIV or AIDS, the abuser may imply that the victim will be unable to find another partner due to their positive HIV status or that they will die alone.The abuser may also claim that it is the victim's fault that the abuser has HIV or AIDS, essentially [[Emotional blackmail|emotionally blackmailing]] them to stay in the relationship.

There are many health related ways that HIV or AIDS can affect domestic violence in same-sex relationships.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Some perpetrators of domestic violence purposefully try to transmit [[Sexually transmitted infection|STDs]] to their partner or to transmit their partner's STD to themselves, as a tactic to control their partner. Additionally, many people in same-sex relationships who experienced domestic violence experienced violence specifically because they had asked their partners to use [[condom]]s or other [[prophylactics]], which are known to limit the spread of HIV.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In conjunction with this, abusers may tamper with their partner's [[pre-exposure prophylaxis]] medications that prevent the spread of HIV, or may use the social [[Slut-shaming|stigma surrounding the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis]] to convince their partner not to use it.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calabrese|first=Sarah K.|last2=Underhill|first2=Kristen|date=2016-10-26|title=How Stigma Surrounding the Use of HIV Preexposure Prophylaxis Undermines Prevention and Pleasure: A Call to Destigmatize "Truvada Whores"|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=105|issue=10|pages=1960–1964|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2015.302816|issn=0090-0036|pmc=4566537|pmid=26270298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dean|first=Tim|title=Mediated Intimacies: Raw Sex, Truvada, &amp; the Biopolitics of Chemoprophylaxis|url=https://www.academia.edu/19691468/Mediated_Intimacies_Raw_Sex_Truvada_and_the_Biopolitics_of_Chemoprophylaxis|journal=Sexualities|publication-date=February 2015|volume=18|pages=224–246|doi=10.1177/1363460715569137|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abuser may also tamper with their partner's or their own [[Management of HIV/AIDS|HIV medication]], or keep their partner from receiving health care in other ways.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Furthermore, those with HIV or AIDS may be more affected by physical violence than those who are healthy, as their [[immune system]]s are weak and physical injuries will be harder to recover from. Those living with HIV or AIDS may also be more affected by [[emotional trauma]] for the same reason.

=== Homophobia ===
Homophobia plays a role in causing domestic violence in same-sex relationships as well as being a systemic issue as to why victims of same-sex domestic violence lack access to resources.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

One way this occurs is through the fear of being "[[Outing|outed]]," as abusers may use this fear of being outed to control their partners or an abuser may use the fact that they are not out to limit their partner's exposure to other LGBT people who would recognize that their relationship is unhealthy.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/domestic_violence1/publications/ABA_LGBT-rights_Final.authcheckdam.pdf|title=What Rights Do I Have As An LGBT Victim of Domestic Violence?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.americanbar.org|publisher=American Bar Association|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Another way homophobia plays a role in domestic violence is that people in same-sex relationships may feel that they have a duty to represent the LGBT community in a positive manner, and that if their relationship is abusive it is proof that homosexuality is inherently wrong, immoral, or otherwise flawed.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Further, the abuser may frame the abuse as justified because of the victim's [[Sexual orientation]], or imply that no one will help the victim because of their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehotline.org/is-this-abuse/lgbt-abuse/|title=The National Domestic Violence Hotline {{!}}   LGBTQ Abuse|website=www.thehotline.org|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a systematic level, many resources offered to victims of domestic violence are not offered to victims of domestic violence in same-sex relationships. This refusal to help victims of same-sex domestic violence victims occurs both by private domestic violence help centers and by law enforcement, who may not treat same-sex domestic violence as seriously as domestic violence in heterosexual relationships.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Gendered expectations ===
Historically, domestic violence was viewed by many [[Feminism|feminists]] as "a manifestation of patriarchal power."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This definition saw domestic violence as a phenomenon acted out by men onto women, therefore leaving out [[Domestic violence against men|male victims of domestic violence]] and victims of domestic violence in same-sex relationships. Some abusers even capitalize on the idea that domestic violence cannot occur in same-sex relationships to convince their partner that the abuse is normal or non-abusive.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

One idea that persists and is harmful to lesbians, is that sexual assault is less serious or aggressive when perpetrated by women.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, being sexually assaulted can be traumatic to victims regardless of the gender of the perpetrator. Similarly, women stalking other women or men seem as less threatening than the same actions being perpetrated by men, so lesbian victims of stalking may be ignored by law enforcement and other individuals.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Part of this problem that specifically impacts lesbians is that lesbians are assumed to have perfect relationships specifically because there is no man involved in the situation. This idea of a "lesbian utopia" makes it more difficult for lesbians to report domestic violence, because often people don't believe it can be true.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Gay men may feel that being battered is a threat to their [[masculinity]], and thus are hesitant to report domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Some abusers may frame the abuse as simply an "expression of masculinity," which normalizes the physical violence.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Data collection issues ===
There are several problems with data collection about domestic violence in same-sex relationships, including lack of reporting, biased sampling, and lack of interest in studying same-sex domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For example, if samples are taken at a center that caters to LGBT individuals, the results may be unregularly high, as those who use these services may also be those in need of help, or unregularly low, as abusers often limit their partner's exposure to others, especially those who may recognize their relationship as abusive.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12038">'''"Esquisse d'un Programme"''' (Sketch of a Programme) is a famous proposal for long-term mathematical research made by the German-born, French mathematician [[Alexander Grothendieck]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Scharlau, Winifred (September 2008), written at Oberwolfach, Germany, "Who is Alexander Grothendieck", ''Notices of the American Mathematical Society'' (Providence, RI: American Mathematical Society) 55(8): 930–941, {{issn|1088-9477}}, {{OCLC|34550461}}, http://www.ams.org/notices/200808/tx080800930p.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He pursued the sequence of logically linked ideas in his important project proposal from 1984 until 1988, but his proposed research continues to date to be of major interest in several branches of advanced mathematics. Grothendieck's vision provides inspiration today for several developments in mathematics such as the extension and generalization of [[Galois theory]], which is currently being extended based on his original proposal.

==Brief history==
Submitted in 1984, the ''Esquisse d'un Programme''&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Grothendieck, 1984. "[http://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~leila.schneps/grothendieckcircle/EsquisseFr.pdf Esquisse d'un Programme]", (1984 manuscript), finally published in Schneps and Lochak (1997, I), pp.5-48; English transl., ibid., pp. 243-283. {{MR|1483107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://matematicas.unex.es/~navarro/res/esquisseeng.pdf|title=Sketch of a programme ''(English translation, hosted by the University of Extremadura)''|accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a proposal submitted by Alexander Grothendieck for a position at the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research|Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]]. The proposal was not successful, but Grothendieck obtained a special position where, while keeping his affiliation at the university of Montpellier, he was paid by the CNRS and released of his teaching obligations. Grothendieck held this position from 1984 till 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Rehmeyer, Julie (May 9, 2008), "Sensitivity to the Harmony of Things", ''Science News''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Allyn (November, 2004) "Comme Appelé du Néant - As if summoned from the void: the life of Alexandre Grothendieck", Notices of the AMS&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal was not formally published until 1997, because the author "could not be found, much less his permission requested".&lt;ref&gt;Schneps and Lochak (1997, I) p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The outlines of ''[[dessin d'enfant|dessins d'enfants]]'', or "children's  drawings", and "[[Anabelian geometry]]", that are contained in this manuscript continue to inspire research; thus, "'''Anabelian geometry''' is a proposed theory in [[mathematics]], describing the way the [[algebraic fundamental group]] ''G'' of an [[algebraic variety]] ''V'', or some related geometric object, determines how ''V'' can be mapped into another geometric object ''W'', under the assumption that ''G'' is '''not'''  an [[abelian group]], in the sense of being strongly [[noncommutative]]. The word ''anabelian'' (an [[alpha privative]] ''an-'' before ''abelian'') was introduced in ''Esquisse d'un Programme''. While the work of Grothendieck was for many years unpublished, and unavailable through the traditional formal scholarly channels, the formulation and predictions of the proposed theory received much attention, and some alterations, at the hands of a number of mathematicians. Those who have researched in this area have obtained some expected and related results, and in the 21st century the beginnings of such a theory started to be available."''

===Extensions of Galois's theory for groups: Galois groupoids, categories and functors===
[[Galois]] has developed a powerful, fundamental [[algebraic theory]] in mathematics that provides very efficient computations for certain algebraic problems by utilizing the algebraic concept of [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], which is now known as the theory of [[Galois group]]s; such computations were not possible before, and also in many cases are much more effective than the 'direct' calculations without using groups.&lt;ref&gt;Cartier, Pierre (1998), "La Folle Journée, de Grothendieck à Connes et Kontsevich — Évolution des Notions d'Espace et de Symétrie", ''Les Relations entre les Mathématiques et la Physique Théorique — Festschrift for the 40th anniversary of the ''IHÉS'', Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques'', pp. 11–19&lt;/ref&gt; To begin with, Alexander Grothendieck stated in his proposal:'' "Thus, the group of Galois is realized as the [[automorphism group]] of a concrete, [[pro-finite group]] which respects certain structures that are essential to this group."'' This fundamental, Galois group theory in mathematics has been considerably expanded, at first to [[groupoids]]- as proposed in Alexander Grothendieck's ''Esquisse d' un Programme'' (''EdP'')- and now already partially carried out for groupoids; the latter are now further developed beyond groupoids to categories by several groups of mathematicians. Here, we shall focus only on the well-established and fully validated extensions of Galois' theory. Thus, EdP also proposed and anticipated, along previous Alexander Grothendieck's ''[[IHÉS]]'' seminars ([[SGA1]] to [[SGA4]]) held in the 1960s, the development of even more powerful extensions of the original Galois's theory for groups by utilizing categories, [[functors]] and [[natural transformations]], as well as further expansion of the manifold of ideas presented in Alexander Grothendieck's ''[[Descent theory|Descent Theory]]''. The notion of [[Motive (algebraic geometry)|motive]] has also been pursued actively. This was developed into the [[motivic Galois group]], [[Grothendieck topology]] and Grothendieck category
.&lt;ref&gt;http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/GrothendieckCategory.html&lt;/ref&gt; Such developments were recently extended in [[algebraic topology]] ''via'' [[representable functor]]s and the [[fundamental groupoid functor]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1316">'''Finality''', in [[law]], is the concept that certain disputes must achieve a resolution from which no further [[appeal]] may be taken, and from which no collateral proceedings may be permitted to disturb that resolution. For example, in some jurisdictions, a person convicted of a crime may not sue their defence attorney for incompetence or [[legal malpractice]] if the civil [[lawsuit]] would call into question the finality of the criminal conviction.  Finality is considered to be important because, absent this there would be no certainty as to the meaning of the law, or the outcome of any legal process. The principle is an aspect of the separation of powers, that being a distinction between the executive and the judicial power. This concept was defined within NSW v Kable [2013]. In this case, the court explained that unless orders were valid until set aside, "the exercise of judicial power could yield no adjudication of right and liability to which immediate effect could be given". 

The importance of finality is the source of the concept of ''[[res judicata]]'' - that the decisions of one court are settled law, and may not be retried in another case brought in a different court.

In [[United States constitutional law]], the '''good-faith exception''' (also '''good-faith doctrine''') is a [[legal doctrine]] providing an exemption to the [[exclusionary rule]]. 

The exemption allows evidence collected in violation of [[privacy rights]] as interpreted from the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] to be admitted at [[trial (law)|trial]] if [[police officer]]s acting in [[good faith]] (''bona fides'') relied upon a defective search warrant &amp;mdash; that is, they had reason to believe their actions were legal (measured under the [[reasonable person]] test). 

The rule was established in the two [[companion case]]s decided by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in 1984: ''[[United States v. Leon]]'' (468 U.S. 897) and ''[[Massachusetts v. Sheppard]]'' (468 U.S. 981). The exception permits the courts to consider the mental state of the police officer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10152">In [[evolutionary developmental biology]], '''homeosis''' is the transformation of one [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] into another, arising from [[mutation]] in or misexpression of certain developmentally critical [[gene]]s, specifically homeotic genes. In animals, these developmental genes specifically control the development of organs on their anteroposterior axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Beyond homeosis—HOX function in morphogenesis and organogenesis|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1432-0436.2003.7108004.x/abstract|journal = Differentiation|date = 2003-10-01|issn = 1432-0436|pages = 461–476|volume = 71|issue = 8|doi = 10.1046/j.1432-0436.2003.7108004.x|first = James Castelli-Gair|last = Hombría|first2 = Bridget|last2 = Lovegrove}}&lt;/ref&gt; In plants, however, the developmental genes affected by homeosis may control anything from the development of a [[stamen]] or petals to the development of chlorophyll.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sattler|first=Rolf|date=October 1998|title=Homeosis in Plants|jstor=2444710|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=75|pages=1606–1617|doi=10.2307/2444710|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homeosis may be caused by mutations in [[Hox genes]], found in animals, or others such as the [[MADS-box]] family in plants. Homeosis is a characteristic that has helped [[insect]]s become as successful and diverse as they are.&lt;ref&gt;Lodish et al., 2003. ''Molecular Cell Biology, 5th Edition''. W.H. Freeman and Company, New York.{{Page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeotic mutations work by changing segment identity during development. For example, the ''[[Ultrabithorax]]'' [[genotype]] gives a [[phenotype]] wherein metathoracic and first [[abdominal]] segments become mesothoracic segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/287795a0 |title=Mutations affecting segment number and polarity in [[Drosophila]] |year=1980 |last1=Nüsslein-Volhard |first1=Christiane |last2=Wieschaus |first2=Eric |journal=Nature |volume=287 |issue=5785 |pages=795–801 |pmid=6776413|bibcode=1980Natur.287..795N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another well-known example is ''[[Antennapedia]]'': a [[gain-of-function]] [[allele]] causes legs to develop in the place of [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/325816a0 |title=Redesigning the body plan of [[Drosophila]] by ectopic expression of the homoeotic gene Antennapedia |year=1987 |last1=Schneuwly |first1=Stephan |last2=Klemenz |first2=Roman |last3=Gehring |first3=Walter J. |journal=Nature |volume=325 |issue=6107 |pages=816–818 |pmid=3821869|bibcode=1987Natur.325..816S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Plant morphology|botany]], [[Rolf Sattler]] has revised the concept of homeosis (replacement) by his emphasis on partial homeosis in addition to complete homeosis; this revision is now widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2444710 |pages=1606–1617 |last1=Sattler |first1=R. |title=Homeosis in Plants |volume=75 |issue=10 |journal=American Journal of Botany |year=1988 |doi=10.2307/2444710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeotic mutants in [[angiosperms]] are thought to be rare in the wild: in the annual plant ''[[Clarkia]]'' ([[Onagraceae]]), homeotic mutants are known where the petals are replaced by a second whorl of sepal-like organs, originating via a mutation governed by a single recessive gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/358671a0 |title=Bicalyx is a natural homeotic floral variant |year=1992 |last1=Ford |first1=V. S. |last2=Gottlieb |first2=L. D. |journal=Nature |volume=358 |issue=6388 |pages=671–673|bibcode=1992Natur.358..671F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of lethal or deleterious consequences in floral mutants resulting in distinct morphological expressions has been a factor in the evolution of Clarkia, and perhaps also in many other plant groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2461245 |pages=681–709 |last1=Gottlieb |first1=L. D. |title=Genetics and Morphological Evolution in Plants |volume=123 |issue=5 |journal=The American Naturalist |year=1984 |doi=10.1086/284231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homeotic mechanisms in animals==
Following the work on homeotic mutants by [[Edward B. Lewis|Ed Lewis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A gene complex controlling segmentation in [[Drosophila]] |year=1978 |last1=Lewis |first1=EB |journal=Nature |volume=276 |issue=5688 |pages=565–570 |pmid=103000 |doi=10.1038/276565a0|bibcode=1978Natur.276..565L }}&lt;/ref&gt; the phenomenology of homeosis in [[Metazoa|animals]] was further elaborated by discovery of a conserved DNA binding sequence present in many  homeotic proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A conserved DNA sequence in homoeotic genes of the [[Drosophila]] Antennapedia and bithorax complexes |year=1984 |last1=McGinnis |first1=W |last2=Levine |first2=MS |last3=Hafen |first3=E |last4=Kuroiwa |first4=A |last5=Gehring |first5=WJ  |journal=Nature |volume=308 |issue=5958 |pages=428–433 |pmid=6323992 |doi=10.1038/308428a0|bibcode=1984Natur.308..428M }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thus, the 60 amino acid DNA binding protein domain was named the [[homeodomain]], while the 180 bp nucleotide sequence encoding it was named the [[homeobox]]. The homeobox gene clusters studied by Ed Lewis were named the [[Hox genes]], although it should be noted that many more homeobox genes are encoded by animal [[genome]]s than those in the Hox gene clusters.

The homeotic-function of certain proteins was first postulated to be that of a "selector" as proposed by [[Antonio Garcia-Bellido]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Genetic control of wing disc development in [[Drosophila]]. |year=1975 |last1=Garcia-Bellido |first1=A |journal=Ciba Found. Symp |volume=0 |pages=161–-182 |pmid=1039909}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
By definition selectors were imagined to be ([[transcription factor]]) proteins that stably determined one of two possible cell fates for a cell and its cellular descendants in a [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]].   
While most animal homeotic functions are associated with homeobox-containing factors, not all homeotic proteins in animals are encoded by homeobox genes, and further not all homeobox genes are necessarily associated with homeotic functions or ([[mutant]]) phenotypes.
The concept of homeotic selectors was further elaborated or at least qualified by [[Michael Akam]] in a so-called "post-selector gene" model that incorporated additional findings and "walked back" the "orthodoxy" of selector-dependent stable binary switches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hox genes, homeosis and the evolution of segment identity: no need for hopeless monsters.|year=1998 |last1=Akam |first1=M |journal=International Journal of Developmental Biology |volume=42 | pages=445–451 |pmid=9654030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[Compartment (development)|tissue compartments]] is deeply intertwined with the selector model of homeosis because the selector-mediated maintenance of cell fate can be restricted into different organizational units of an animal's [[body plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Signals and mechanics shaping compartment boundaries in [[Drosophila]] |year=2015 |last1=Umetsu |first1=D |last2=Dahmann |first2=C |journal=Wiley Interdiscip Rev Dev Biol |volume=4 |pages=407–417 |pmid=25755098 |doi=10.1002/wdev.178}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this context, newer insights into homeotic mechanisms were found by [[Albert Erives]] and colleagues by focusing on [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer DNAs]] that are co-targeted by homeotic selectors and different combinations of developmental signals.&lt;ref name=Stroebele/&gt;
This work identifies a protein biochemical difference between the [[transcription factor]]s that function as homeotic selectors versus the [[transcription factor]]s that function as effectors of developmental signaling pathways, such as the [[Notch signaling pathway]] and the [[Transforming growth factor beta superfamily|BMP signaling pathway]].&lt;ref name="Stroebele"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Integration of Orthogonal Signaling by the Notch and Dpp Pathways in Drosophila |year=2016 |last1=Stroebele |first1=E |last2=Erives |first2=A |journal=Genetics |volume=203 |pages=219–240 |pmid=26975664 |doi=10.1534/genetics.116.186791 |pmc=4858776}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This work proposes that homeotic selectors function to "license" [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer DNAs]] in a restricted [[Compartment (development)|tissue compartment]] so that the enhancers are enabled to read-out developmental signals, which are then integrated via [[Polyglutamine tract|polyglutamine]]-mediated aggregation.&lt;ref name=Stroebele/&gt;

==Homeotic mechanisms in plants==
Like the complex [[Multicellular organism|multicellularity]] seen in [[animals]], the multicellularity of [[land plants]] is developmentally organized into [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] and [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] units via [[transcription factor]] genes with homeotic effects.&lt;ref name="Sablowski"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Control of patterning, growth, and differentiation by floral organ identity genes. |year=2015 |last1=Sablowski |first1=R |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=1065–1073 |pmid=25609826 |doi=10.1093/jxb/eru514}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although plants have homeobox-containing genes, plant homeotic factors tend to possess [[MADS-box]] DNA binding domains.
Animal genomes also possess a small number [[MADS-box]] factors.
Thus, in the independent evolution of [[Multicellular organism|multicellularity]] in plants and animals, different [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] transcription factor families were [[Exaptation|co-opted]] to serve homeotic functions. 
MADS-domain factors have been proposed to function as co-factors to more specialized factors and thereby help to determine organ identity.&lt;ref name=Sablowski/&gt;
This has been proposed to correspond more closely to the interpretation of animal homeotics outlined by [[Michael Akam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hox genes: From master genes to micromanagers |year=1998 |last1=Akam |first1=M |journal=Current Biology |volume=8 |pages=R676 |pmid=9768351 |doi=10.1016/s0960-9822(98)70433-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30395">The '''illusion of control''' is the tendency for people to overestimate their ability to control events; for example, it occurs when someone feels a sense of control over outcomes that they demonstrably do not influence.&lt;ref name="thompson_defn"&gt;{{harvnb| Thompson|1999|pp=187,124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect was named by psychologist [[Ellen Langer]] and has been replicated in many different contexts.&lt;ref name="plous171"&gt;{{harvnb |Plous|1993|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought to influence [[gambling]] behavior and belief in the [[paranormal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vyse|1997|pp=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[illusory superiority]] and [[optimism bias]], the illusion of control is one of the [[positive illusions]].

Psychological theorists have consistently emphasized the importance of perceptions of control over life events. One of the earliest instances of this is when [[Alfred Adler|Adler]] argued that people strive for proficiency in their lives. [[Fritz Heider|Heider]] later proposed that humans have a strong motive to control their environment and Wyatt Mann hypothesized a basic competence motive that people satisfy by exerting control. [[Bernard Weiner|Wiener]], an [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]] theorist, modified his original theory of achievement motivation to include a controllability dimension. [[Harold Kelley|Kelley]] then argued that people's failure to detect noncontingencies may result in their attributing uncontrollable outcomes to personal causes. Nearer to the present, Taylor and Brown&lt;ref name="taylor"/&gt; argued that positive illusions, including the illusion of control, foster mental health.&lt;ref name="Social behavior"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Presson|first=Paul K.|last2=Benassi|first2=Victor A.|title=Illusion of control: A meta-analytic review|journal=Journal of Social Behavior &amp; Personality|year=1996|volume=11|issue=3|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1996-06041-006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The illusion is more common in familiar situations, and in situations where the person knows the desired outcome.&lt;ref name="thompson187"&gt;{{harvnb| Thompson|1999|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feedback that emphasizes success rather than failure can increase the effect, while feedback that emphasizes failure can decrease or reverse the effect.&lt;ref name=thompson188 /&gt; The illusion is weaker for [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] individuals and is stronger when individuals have an emotional need to control the outcome.&lt;ref name=thompson187 /&gt; The illusion is strengthened by stressful and competitive situations, including [[trader (finance)|financial trading]].&lt;ref name=trading /&gt; Although people are likely to overestimate their control when the situations are heavily chance-determined, they also tend to underestimate their control when they actually have it, which runs contrary to some theories of the illusion and its adaptiveness.&lt;ref name="Control"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gino|first1=Francesca|last2=Sharek|first2=Zachariah|last3=Moore|first3=Don A.|title=Keeping the illusion of control under control: Ceilings, floors, and imperfect calibration|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|date=2011|volume=114|issue=2|pages=104–114|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2010.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; People also showed a higher illusion of control when they were allowed to become familiar with a task through practice trials, make their choice before the event happens like with throwing dice, and when they can make their choice rather than have it made for them with the same odds.  People are more likely to show control when they have more answers right at the beginning than at the end, even when the people had the same number of correct answers.&lt;ref name="Social behavior" /&gt;

The illusion might arise because people lack direct [[introspection|introspective]] insight into whether they are in control of events. This has been called the [[introspection illusion]]. Instead they may judge their degree of control by a process that is often unreliable. As a result, they see themselves as responsible for events when there is little or no [[causality|causal link]]. In one study, college students were in a virtual reality setting to treat a fear of heights using an elevator. Those who were told that they had control, yet had none felt as though they had as much control as those who actually did have control over the elevator. Those who were led to believe they did not have control said they felt as though they had little control.&lt;ref name="Virtual Reality Illusion of Control"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hobbs|first=Christin |author2=Kreiner, Honeycutt |author3=Hinds, Brockman|title=The Illusion of Control in a Virtual Reality Setting|journal=North American Journal of Psychology|year=2010|volume=12|issue=3|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/article/North-American-Journal-Psychology/245167898.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By proxy==
At times, people attempt to gain control by transferring responsibility to more capable or “luckier” others to act for them.  By forfeiting direct control, it is perceived to be a valid way of maximizing outcomes. This illusion of control by proxy is a significant theoretical extension of the traditional illusion of control model. People will of course give up control if another person is thought to have more knowledge or skill in areas such as medicine where actual skill and knowledge are involved. In cases like these it is entirely rational to give up responsibility to people such as doctors. However, when it comes to events of pure chance, allowing another to make decisions (or gamble) on one's behalf, because they are seen as luckier is not rational and would go against people's well-documented desire for control in uncontrollable situations.  However, it does seem plausible since people generally believe that they can possess luck and employ it to advantage in games of chance, and it is not a far leap that others may also be seen as lucky and able to control uncontrollable events.

In one instance, a lottery pool at a company decides who picks the numbers and buys the tickets based on the wins and losses of each member. The member with the best record becomes the representative until they accumulate a certain number of losses and then a new representative is picked based on wins and losses. Even though no member is truly better than the other and it is all by chance, they still would rather have someone with seemingly more luck to have control over them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Enzle|first=Michael E.|author2=Michael J. A. Wohl|title=Illusion of control by proxy: Placing one's fate in the hands of another|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|date=March 2009|volume=48|issue=1|pages=183–200|doi=10.1348/014466607x258696}}&lt;!--|accessdate=7 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In another real-world example, in the 2002 Olympics men's and women's hockey finals, Team Canada beat Team USA but it was later believed that the win was the result of the luck of a [[Loonie#Lucky loonie|Canadian coin]] that was secretly placed under the ice before the game. The members of Team Canada were the only people who knew the coin had been placed there. The coin was later put in the Hockey Hall of Fame where there was an opening so people could touch it. People believed they could transfer luck from the coin to themselves by touching it, and thereby change their own luck.

==Demonstration==
The illusion of control is demonstrated by three converging lines of evidence: 1) laboratory experiments, 2) observed behavior in familiar games of chance such as lotteries, and 3) self-reports of real-world behavior.&lt;ref name="illusions116"&gt;{{harvnb| Thompson|2004|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One kind of laboratory demonstration involves two lights marked "Score" and "No Score". Subjects have to try to control which one lights up. In one version of this experiment, subjects could press either of two buttons.&lt;ref name="Jenkins1965"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jenkins|first1=Herbert M.|last2=Ward|first2=William C.|title=Judgment of contingency between responses and outcomes|journal=Psychological Monographs: General and Applied|date=1965|volume=79|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1037/h0093874|pmid=14300511}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another version had one button, which subjects decided on each trial to press or not.&lt;ref name="allan_jenkins"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allan |first1= L.G.|last2=Jenkins |first2=H.M. |year=1980 |title=The judgment of contingency and the nature of the response alternatives |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychology |volume=34 |pages=1–11 |doi=10.1037/h0081013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects had a variable degree of control over the lights, or none at all, depending on how the buttons were connected. The experimenters made clear that there might be no relation between the subjects' actions and the lights.&lt;ref name="allan_jenkins" /&gt; Subjects estimated how much control they had over the lights. These estimates bore no relation to how much control they actually had, but was related to how often the "Score" light lit up. Even when their choices made no difference at all, subjects confidently reported exerting some control over the lights.&lt;ref name="allan_jenkins" /&gt;

Ellen Langer's research demonstrated that people were more likely to behave as if they could exercise control in a chance situation where "skill cues" were present.&lt;ref name="langer1975"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langer |first=Ellen J.  |year=1975 |title= The Illusion of Control |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=311–328 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.32.2.311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="headstails"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Langer |first1= Ellen J. |last2=Roth |first2=Jane |year=1975 |title= Heads I win, tails it's chance: The illusion of control as a function of the sequence of outcomes in a purely chance task |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=951–955 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.32.6.951}}&lt;/ref&gt; By skill cues, Langer meant properties of the situation more normally associated with the exercise of skill, in particular the exercise of choice, competition, familiarity with the stimulus and involvement in decisions. One simple form of this effect is found in [[casino]]s: when rolling [[dice]] in a [[craps]] game people tend to throw harder when they need high numbers and softer for low numbers.&lt;ref name="plous171" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Henslin |first=J. M. |year=1967 |title=Craps and magic |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=73 |issue=3 |pages=316–330 |doi=10.1086/224479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another experiment, subjects had to predict the outcome of thirty coin tosses. The feedback was rigged so that each subject was right exactly half the time, but the groups differed in where their "hits" occurred. Some were told that their early guesses were accurate. Others were told that their successes were distributed evenly through the thirty trials. Afterwards, they were surveyed about their performance. Subjects with early "hits" overestimated their total successes and had higher expectations of how they would perform on future guessing games.&lt;ref name="plous171" /&gt;&lt;ref name="headstails" /&gt; This result resembles the ''[[Confirmation bias#Preference for early information|irrational primacy effect]]'' in which people give greater weight to information that occurs earlier in a series.&lt;ref name="plous171" /&gt; Forty percent of the subjects believed their performance on this chance task would improve with practice, and twenty-five percent said that distraction would impair their performance.&lt;ref name="plous171" /&gt;&lt;ref name="headstails" /&gt;

Another of Langer's experiments—replicated by other researchers—involves a lottery. Subjects are either given tickets at random or allowed to choose their own. They can then trade their tickets for others with a higher chance of paying out. Subjects who had chosen their own ticket were more reluctant to part with it. Tickets bearing familiar symbols were less likely to be exchanged than others with unfamiliar symbols. Although these lotteries were random, subjects behaved as though their choice of ticket affected the outcome.&lt;ref name="langer1975" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|2004|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Participants who chose their own numbers were less likely to trade their ticket even for one in a game with better odds.&lt;ref name="Social behavior" /&gt;

Another way to investigate perceptions of control is to ask people about hypothetical situations, for example their likelihood of being involved in a motor vehicle accident. On average, drivers regard accidents as much less likely in "high-control" situations, such as when they are driving, than in "low-control" situations, such as when they are in the passenger seat. They also rate a high-control accident, such as driving into the car in front, as much less likely than a low-control accident such as being hit from behind by another driver.&lt;ref name="illusions116" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=It won't happen to me: Unrealistic optimism or illusion of control? |last=McKenna |first= F. P. |journal=British Journal of Psychology |year=1993 |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=39–50|publisher=British Psychological Society|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1993.tb02461.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hardman /&gt;

==Explanations==
Ellen Langer, who first demonstrated the illusion of control, explained her findings in terms of a confusion between skill and chance situations. She proposed that people base their judgments of control on "skill cues". These are features of a situation that are usually associated with games of skill, such as competitiveness, familiarity and individual choice. When more of these skill cues are present, the illusion is stronger.&lt;ref name="thompson188"&gt;{{harvnb| Thompson|1999|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trading /&gt;&lt;ref name="pohl_explanations"&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|2004|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suzanne Thompson and colleagues argued that Langer's explanation was inadequate to explain all the variations in the effect. As an alternative, they proposed that judgments about control are based on a procedure that they called the "control heuristic".&lt;ref name=thompson188 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Illusions of Control, Underestimations, and Accuracy: A Control Heuristic Explanation| first1=Suzanne C. |last1=Thompson |first2=Wade |last2=Armstrong| first3=Craig |last3=Thomas|journal=Psychological Bulletin |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=123 |issue=2|year=1998| pages=143–161 |pmid=9522682|ref=harv | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.123.2.143}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory proposes that judgments of control to depend on two conditions; an intention to create the outcome, and a relationship between the action and outcome. In games of chance, these two conditions frequently go together. As well as an intention to win, there is an action, such as throwing a die or pulling a lever on a [[slot machine]], which is immediately followed by an outcome. Even though the outcome is selected randomly, the control heuristic would result in the player feeling a degree of control over the outcome.&lt;ref name="pohl_explanations" /&gt;

[[Self-regulation theory]] offers another explanation. To the extent that people are driven by internal goals concerned with the exercise of control over their environment, they will seek to reassert control in conditions of chaos, uncertainty or stress. One way of coping with a lack of real control is to falsely attribute oneself control of the situation.&lt;ref name="trading" /&gt;

The [[core self-evaluations]] (CSE) trait is a stable personality trait composed of [[locus of control]], [[neuroticism]], [[self-efficacy]], and [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref name=Judge1997&gt;{{cite book|last1=Judge|first1=Timothy A.|last2=Locke|first2=Edwin A.|last3=Durham|first3=Cathy C.|year=1997|chapter=The dispositional causes of job satisfaction: A core evaluations approach|title=Research in Organizational Behavior|volume=19|pages=151–188|isbn=978-0762301799}}&lt;/ref&gt; While those with high core self-evaluations are likely to believe that they control their own environment (i.e., internal locus of control),&lt;ref name="Judge2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Judge|first1=Timothy A.|last2=Kammeyer-Mueller|first2=John D.|title=Implications of core self-evaluations for a changing organizational context|journal=Human Resource Management Review|volume=21|issue=4|year=2011|pages=331–341| url=http://timothy-judge.com/documents/ImplicationsofCSEsforachangingorgcontext.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.hrmr.2010.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; very high levels of CSE may lead to the illusion of control.

==Benefits and costs to the individual==
{{see also|Depressive realism}}
Taylor and Brown have argued that positive illusions, including the illusion of control, are adaptive as they motivate people to persist at tasks when they might otherwise give up.&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor |first1=Shelley E. |last2=Brown |first2=Jonathon D. |title=Illusion and well-being: A social psychological perspective on mental health. |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=103 |issue=2 |year=1988 |pages=193–210 |url=http://taylorlab.psych.ucla.edu/1988_Illusion%20and%20well-being_A%20social%20psychological%20perspective%20on%20mental%20health.pdf |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.103.2.193 |pmid=3283814 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719204438/http://taylorlab.psych.ucla.edu/1988_Illusion%20and%20well-being_A%20social%20psychological%20perspective%20on%20mental%20health.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This position is supported by [[Albert Bandura]]'s claim that "optimistic self-appraisals of capability, that are not unduly disparate from what is possible, can be advantageous, whereas [[veridical]] judgements can be self-limiting".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bandura |first= A.  |year=1989 |title=Human Agency in Social Cognitive Theory |journal=American Psychologist |volume= 44 |issue=9 |pages=1175–1184 |doi=10.1037/0003-066x.44.9.1175|pmid= 2782727  }}&lt;/ref&gt; His argument is essentially concerned with the adaptive effect of optimistic beliefs about control and performance in circumstances where control is possible, rather than perceived control in circumstances where outcomes do not depend on an individual's behavior.

Bandura has also suggested that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In activities where the margins of error are narrow and missteps can produce costly or injurious consequences, personal well-being is best served by highly accurate efficacy appraisal."&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1997). ''[[Self-efficacy: The exercise of control]]''. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Taylor and Brown argue that positive illusions are [[Adaptive behavior|adaptive]], since there is evidence that they are more common in normally mentally healthy individuals than in depressed individuals. However, Pacini, Muir and Epstein have shown that this may be because depressed people overcompensate for a tendency toward maladaptive intuitive processing by exercising excessive rational control in trivial situations, and note that the difference with non-depressed people disappears in more consequential circumstances.&lt;ref name="PaciniMuir1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pacini|first1=Rosemary|last2=Muir|first2=Francisco|last3=Epstein|first3=Seymour|title=Depressive realism from the perspective of cognitive-experiential self-theory|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=74|issue=4|year=1998|pages=1056–1068|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.4.1056|pmid=9569659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also [[empirical evidence]] that high self-efficacy can be maladaptive in some circumstances. In a scenario-based study, Whyte et al. showed that participants in whom they had induced high self-efficacy were significantly more likely to escalate commitment to a failing course of action.&lt;ref name="WhyteSaks1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whyte|first1=Glen|last2=Saks|first2=Alan M.|last3=Hook|first3=Sterling|title=When success breeds failure: the role of self-efficacy in escalating commitment to a losing course of action|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|volume=18|issue=5|year=1997|pages=415–432|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-1379(199709)18:5&lt;415::AID-JOB813&gt;3.0.CO;2-G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knee and Zuckerman have challenged the definition of mental health used by Taylor and Brown and argue that lack of illusions is associated with a non-defensive personality oriented towards growth and learning and with low ego involvement in outcomes.&lt;ref name=KneeZuckerman1998&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knee|first1=C.Raymond|last2=Zuckerman|first2=Miron|title=A Nondefensive Personality: Autonomy and Control as Moderators of Defensive Coping and Self-Handicapping|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|date=1998|volume=32|issue=2|pages=115–130|doi=10.1006/jrpe.1997.2207 |url=http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/biases/32_J_Research_Personality_115_(Knee).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They present evidence that self-determined individuals are less prone to these illusions. In the late 1970s, [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson|Abramson]] and [[Lauren Alloy|Alloy]] demonstrated that depressed individuals held a more accurate view than their non-depressed counterparts in a test which measured illusion of control.&lt;ref name="AbramsonAlloy1980"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Baum|editor-first1=A.|editor-last2=Singer|editor-first2=J.

However, when replicating the findings Msetfi et al. (2005, 2007) found that the overestimation of control in nondepressed people only showed up when the interval was long enough, implying that this is because they take more aspects of a situation into account than their depressed counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17470210601002595 |vauthors=Msetfi RM, Murphy RA, Simpson J |year=2007 |title=Depressive realism and the effect of intertrial interval on judgements of zero, positive, and negative contingencies |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=461–481 |pmid=17366312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.134.1.10 |vauthors=Msetfi RM, Murphy RA, Simpson J, Kornbrot DE |year=2005 |title=Depressive realism and outcome density bias in contingency judgments: the effect of the context and intertrial interval |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology.

(2007) has proposed that the pessimistic bias of depressives resulted in "depressive realism" when asked about estimation of control, because depressed individuals are more likely to say no even if they have control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17470210601002686 |vauthors=Allan LG, Siegel S, Hannah S |year=2007 |title=The sad truth about depressive realism |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=482–495 |url=http://psych.mcmaster.ca/hannahsd/pubs/AllanSiegelHannah%2707.pdf |format=PDF |pmid=17366313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of studies have found a link between a sense of control and health, especially in older people.&lt;ref name="plous172"&gt;{{harvnb |Plous|1993|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fenton-O'Creevy et al.&lt;ref name="trading" /&gt; argue, as do Gollwittzer and Kinney,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gollwitzer |first1= P.M. |last2=Kinney |first2=R.F. |year=1989 |title=Effects of Deliberative and Implemental Mind-Sets On Illusion of Control |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=531–542 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.56.4.531}}&lt;/ref&gt; that while illusory beliefs about control may promote goal striving, they are not conducive to sound decision-making. Illusions of control may cause insensitivity to feedback, impede learning and predispose toward greater objective risk taking (since subjective risk will be reduced by illusion of control).

==Applications==
Psychologist [[Daniel Wegner]] argues that an illusion of control over external events underlies belief in [[psychokinesis]], a supposed paranormal ability to move objects directly using the mind.&lt;ref name="selfismagic"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wegner|first=Daniel M.|title=Are we free?: psychology and free will|editor=John Baer |editor2=[[James C.

In one experiment, subjects watched a [[basketball]] player taking a series of [[free throws]]. When they were instructed to visualise him making his shots, they felt that they had contributed to his success.&lt;ref name=Pronin2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pronin |first1=Emily |last2=Wegner |first2=Daniel M. |last3=McCarthy |first3=Kimberly |last4=Rodriguez |first4=Sylvia |title=Everyday magical powers: The role of apparent mental causation in the overestimation of personal influence. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |date=2006 |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=218–231 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.91.2.218 |url=http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~wegner/pdfs/Pronin%2C%20Wegner%2C%20McCarthy%2C%20%26%20Rodriguez%20%282006%29.pdf |pmid=16881760 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105011719/http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~wegner/pdfs/Pronin%2C%20Wegner%2C%20McCarthy%2C%20%26%20Rodriguez%20%282006%29.pdf |archivedate=2011-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study examined traders working in the [[City of London]]'s [[investment banking|investment banks]]. They each watched a graph being plotted on a computer screen, similar to a real-time graph of a stock price or index. Using three computer keys, they had to raise the value as high as possible. They were warned that the value showed random variations, but that the keys might have some effect. In fact, the fluctuations were not affected by the keys.&lt;ref name="trading" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hardman" /&gt; The traders' ratings of their success measured their susceptibility to the illusion of control. This score was then compared with each trader's performance. Those who were more prone to the illusion scored significantly lower on analysis, [[risk management]] and contribution to profits.

'''Industrial melanism''' is an [[evolution]]ary effect prominent in several [[arthropod]]s, where dark [[pigmentation]] ([[melanism]]) has evolved in an environment affected by [[industrial pollution]], including sulphur dioxide gas and dark soot deposits. Sulphur dioxide kills [[lichen]]s, leaving tree [[Bark (botany)|bark]] bare where in clean areas it is boldly patterned, while soot darkens bark and other surfaces. Darker pigmented individuals have a higher fitness in those areas as their [[camouflage]] matches the polluted background better; they are thus favoured by [[natural selection]].  This change, extensively studied by [[Bernard Kettlewell]], is a popular [[Teaching of evolution|teaching example in Darwinian evolution]], providing [[Coloration evidence for natural selection|evidence for natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Majerus2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Majerus |first1=Michael E.

Industrial melanism is widespread in the [[Lepidoptera]] (butterflies and moths), involving over 70 species such as ''[[Odontopera bidentata]]'' (scalloped hazel)&lt;ref name=CookTurner2008&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cook |first1=L.

The rapid decline of melanism that has accompanied the reduction of pollution, in effect a [[natural experiment]], makes natural selection for camouflage "the only credible explanation".&lt;ref name=CookTurner2008/&gt;

Other explanations for the observed correlation with industrial pollution have been proposed, including strengthening the immune system in a polluted environment, absorbing heat more rapidly when sunlight is reduced by air pollution, and the ability to excrete trace elements into melanic scales and feathers.

==History==
[[File:Biston betularia 20110529 102239 8073M.JPG|thumb|upright|Intermediate ''insularia'' form (between pale ''typica'' and dark ''carbonaria'' in tone) of peppered moth on a [[lichen]]-covered [[birch]] tree: [[Bernard Kettlewell]] counted the frequencies of all three forms.&lt;ref name=Kettlewell1955/&gt;]]

Industrial melanism was first noticed in 1900 by the geneticist [[William Bateson]]; he observed that the colour morphs were inherited, but did not suggest an explanation for the [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]].&lt;ref name=CookTurner2008/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bateson, William |authorlink=William Bateson |year=1900 |title=Collective enquiry as to progressive melanism in moths—memorandum from the Evolution Committee of the Royal Society |journal=Entomological Record |volume=12 |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, the geneticist [[Leonard Doncaster]] described the increase in frequency of the melanic forms of several moth species from about 1800 to 1850 in the [[Industrial Revolution|heavily industrialised]] north-west region of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Doncaster, Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Doncaster |year=1906 |title=Collective enquiry as to progressive melanism in Lepidoptera |journal=Entomological Record |volume=18 |pages=165–168, 206–208, 222–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, the evolutionary biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] constructed a [[mathematical model|mathematical argument]] showing that the rapid growth in frequency of the ''carbonaria''  form of the peppered moth, ''Biston betularia'', implied [[natural selection|selective pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haldane |first=J.

From 1955 onwards, the geneticist [[Bernard Kettlewell]] conducted [[Kettlewell's experiment|a series of experiments]] exploring the [[peppered moth evolution|evolution of melanism in the peppered moth]]. He used a [[capture-mark-recapture]] technique to show that dark forms survived better than light ones.&lt;ref name=Kettlewell1955&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kettlewell |first1=H. B.

By 1973, pollution in England had begun to decrease, and the dark ''carbonaria'' form had declined in frequency. This provided convincing evidence, gathered and analysed by Kettlewell and others such as the entomologist and geneticist [[Michael Majerus]] and the population geneticist Laurence M. Cook, that its rise and fall had been caused by natural selection in response to the changing pollution of the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kettlewell, H. B.

==Taxonomic range==

Industrial melanism is known from over 70 species of [[moth]] that Kettlewell found in England, and many others from Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hendry |first1=Andrew P. |last2=Kinnison |first2=Michael T. |title=Microevolution Rate, Pattern, Process |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E031CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA185 |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-010-0585-2 |pages=185–}}, which cites Kettlewell 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;
Among these, ''[[Apamea crenata]]'' (clouded border brindle moth) and ''[[Acronicta rumicis]]'' (knot grass moth) are always polymorphic, though the melanic forms are more common in cities and (like those of the peppered moth) are declining in frequency as those cities become less polluted.&lt;ref name=CookTurner2008/&gt;

Among other insects, industrial melanism has been observed in a [[beetle]], ''[[Adalia bipunctata]]'', the two-spot ladybird.&lt;ref name="MuggletonLonsdale1975"/&gt;

In the vertebrates, industrial melanism is known from the turtle-headed seasnake ''[[Emydocephalus annulatus]]'',&lt;ref name=Goiran/&gt; and may be present in urban [[feral pigeon]]s.&lt;ref name="ChatelainGasparini2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chatelain |first1=M. |last2=Gasparini |first2=J. |last3=Jacquin |first3=L. |last4=Frantz |first4=A. |title=The adaptive function of melanin-based plumage coloration to trace metals |journal=Biology Letters |volume=10 |issue=3 |year=2014 |pages=20140164–20140164 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2014.0164|pmc=3982444 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, peppered moths lived where light-colored [[lichen]]s covered the trees. For [[camouflage]] from predators against that clean background, they had generally light coloration.&lt;ref name=MuggletonLonsdale1975/&gt; During the [[Industrial Revolution]] in England, [[sulphur dioxide]] pollution in the atmosphere reduced the lichen cover, while [[soot]] blackened the bark of urban trees, making the light-colored moths more vulnerable to predation. This provided a selective advantage to the gene responsible for melanism, and the darker-colored moths increased in frequency.&lt;ref name="Grant1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grant|first1=Bruce S. |title=Fine Tuning the Peppered Moth Paradigm |journal=Evolution |volume=53 |issue=3 |year=1999 |pages=980–984 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1999.tb05394.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McIntyre, N.

Melanic ''B. betularia'' have been widely observed in North America. In 1959, 90% of ''B. betularia'' in Michigan and Pennsylvania were melanic. By 2001, melanism dropped to 6% of the population, following clean air legislation.&lt;ref name=Grant2002&gt;{{cite journal |author=Grant, B. S.; Wiseman L.

===Controversy===

Kettlewell's experiments were criticised by the zoologist Theodore David Sargent, who failed to reproduce Kettlewell's results between 1965 and 1969, and argued that Kettlewell had specially trained his birds to give the desired results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sargent |first1=TD |title=Cryptic moths: effects on background selections of painting the circumocular scales |journal=Science |year=1968 |volume=159 |issue=3810 |pages=100–101 |pmid=5634373 |doi=10.1126/science.159.3810.100|bibcode=1968Sci...159..100S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sargent |first1=T.

It has been suggested that the demonstrated relationship between melanism and pollution can not be fully proven because the exact reason for increase in survivability can not be tracked and pin-pointed. However, as air quality has improved in industrial areas of America and Britain, through improved [[regulation]], offering the conditions for a [[natural experiment]], melanism has sharply declined in moths including ''B. betularia'' and ''[[Odontopera bidentata]]''. Cook and J. R. G. Turner have concluded that "natural selection is the only credible explanation for the overall decline",&lt;ref name=CookTurner2008/&gt; and other biologists working in the area concur with this judgement.&lt;ref name=Grant1998&gt;{{cite journal |author=Grant, B.

===Immunity===

In 1921, the evolutionary biologist [[Richard Goldschmidt]] argued that the observed increase in the melanic form of the black arches moth, ''[[Lymantria monacha]]'', could not have been caused by [[mutation pressure]] alone, but required a selective advantage from an unknown cause: he did not consider camouflage as an explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldschmidt |first=R. |authorlink=Richard Goldschmidt |title=Controversial Geneticist and Creative Biologist: A Critical Review of His Contributions with an Introduction by Karl von Frisch |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D5L5BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75 |year=2013 |publisher=[[Birkhäuser]] |isbn=978-3-0348-5855-7 |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly a century later, it was suggested that the moth's industrial melanism might, in addition ([[pleiotropy]]) to providing camouflage with "the well-known protective dark coloration",&lt;ref name=Mikkola2010/&gt; also confer better immunity to toxic chemicals from industrial pollution. The darker forms have a stronger [[immune response]] to foreign objects; these are encapsulated by [[haemocyte]]s (insect blood cells), and the capsule so formed is then hardened with deposits of the dark pigment, [[melanin]].&lt;ref name=Mikkola2010&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mikkola, K.; Rantala, M. J. |date=2010 |title=Immune defence, a possible nonvisual selective factor behind the industrial melanism of moths (Lepidoptera) |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=99 |issue=4 |pages=831–838 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2010.01398.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillespie andKanost1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gillespie |first1=Jeremy P. |last2=Kanost |first2=Michael R. |last3=Trenczek |first3=Tina |title=Biological Mediators of Insect Immunity |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=42 |issue=1 |year=1997 |pages=611–643 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.42.1.611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trace metal excretion===

A non-camouflage mechanism has been suggested for some vertebrates. In tropical ocean regions subject to industrial pollution the turtle-headed seasnake ''[[Emydocephalus annulatus]]'' is more likely to be melanic. These snakes shed their skin every two to six weeks. Sloughed skin contains toxic minerals, higher for dark skin, so industrial melanism could be selected for through improved excretion of trace elements.{{efn|The article does not address whether this is a genetic mutation or reversible adaptation by individuals.&lt;ref name=Goiran/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Goiran&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goiran, C.; Bustamante, P.; Shine, R. |title=Industrial Melanism in the Seasnake Emydocephalus annulatus |journal=Current Biology |volume=27 |issue=16 |pages=2510–2513.e2 |year=2017 |pmid=28803870 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2017.06.073}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same may apply in the case of urban feral pigeons, which have the ability to remove trace metals such as zinc to their feathers. However, toxic lead was not found to accumulate in feathers, so the putative mechanism is limited in its range.&lt;ref name="ChatelainGasparini2014"/&gt;

===Thermal advantage===

}}

Melanic forms of the two-spot ladybird ''[[Adalia bipunctata]]'' are very frequent in and near cities, and rare in unpolluted countryside, so they appear to be industrial. Ladybirds are [[aposematic]] (with conspicuous warning coloration), so camouflage cannot explain the distribution. A proposed explanation is that the melanic forms have a thermal advantage directly linked to the pollution aspect of industrialization, since smoke and particulates in the air reduce the amount of sunlight that reaches the habitats of these species. Melanic phenotypes should then be favoured by natural selection, as the dark coloration absorbs the limited sunlight better.&lt;ref name="MuggletonLonsdale1975"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Muggleton |first1=John |last2=Lonsdale |first2=David |last3=Benham |first3=Brian R. |title=Melanism in ''Adalia bipunctata'' L. (Col., Coccinellidae) and its Relationship to Atmospheric Pollution |journal=The Journal of Applied Ecology |volume=12 |issue=2 |year=1975 |pages=451 |doi=10.2307/2402167}}&lt;/ref&gt; A possible explanation might be that in colder environments, the thermal advantages of industrial melanism might increase activity and the likelihood to mate. In the Netherlands, melanic ''A. bipunctata'' had a distinct mating advantage over the non-melanic form.&lt;ref name="De JongVerhoog1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=De Jong |first1=Peter W. |last2=Verhoog |first2=Michelle D. |last3=Brakefield |first3=Paul M. |title=Sperm competition and melanic polymorphism in the 2-spot ladybird, ''Adalia bipunctata'' (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae)  |journal=Heredity |volume=70 |issue=2 |year=1993 |pages=172–178 |doi=10.1038/hdy.1993.26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MuggletonLonsdale1975/&gt;

However, thermal melanism failed to explain the distribution of the species near [[Helsinki]] where the city forms a relatively warm 'heat island', while near the Finnish coast there is more sunlight as well as more melanism, so the selective pressure driving melanism requires a different explanation.&lt;ref name=Mikkola1988&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mikkola, K.; Albrecht, A. |year=1988 |title=The melanism of ''Adalia-bipunctata'' around the Gulf of Finland as an industrial phenomenon (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) |journal=Annales Zoologici Fennici |volume=25 |pages=77-85 |jstor=23734522}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in [[Birmingham]] similarly found no evidence of thermal melanism but a strong correlation with smoke pollution; melanism declined from 1960 to 1978 as the city became cleaner. Further, the same study found that a related species, ''[[Adalia decempunctata]]'', experienced no change in frequency of melanism in the same places in that period.&lt;ref name="BrakefieldLees1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brakefield |first1=Paul M. |last2=Lees |first2=David R. |title=Melanism in Adalia ladybirds and declining air pollution in Birmingham |journal=Heredity |volume=59 |issue=2 |year=1987 |pages=273–277 |doi=10.1038/hdy.1987.123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inherent powers''' are powers held by a [[sovereign state]]. In the [[United States]], the [[President of the United States|President]] derives these [[Political power|powers]] from the loosely worded statements in the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] that "the executive Power shall be [[vested]] in a [[President]]" and the president should "take care that the laws be faithfully executed" (defined in practice, rather than by constitutional or [[statutory]] law).

In re Debs, 158 U.S. 564 (1896)[1] was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision involving [[Eugene V. Debs]] and labor unions. Debs (president of the [[American Railway Union]]) was involved in the [[Pullman Strike]] earlier in 1894, and challenged the federal injunction ordering the strikers back to work. The injunction had been issued because of the hindrance to transportation of U.S. Mail. However, Debs refused to end the strike and was cited for contempt of court; he appealed the decision to the courts. The main question being debated was whether the [[President]] had a right to issue the injunction, which dealt with both interstate and intrastate commerce and shipping on rail cars. The legislative branch had never [[delegated]] to the President the power to issue an injunction. However, in a unanimous decision written by Justice David Josiah Brewer, the court ruled in favor of the U.S. government. Joined by Chief Justice Melville Fuller and Associate Justices [[Stephen Johnson Field]], John Marshall Harlan, Horace Gray, Henry Billings Brown, George Shiras, Jr., [[Howell Edmunds Jackson]] and Edward Douglass White, the court ruled that the government had a right to regulate interstate commerce and ensure the operations of the Postal Service, along with a responsibility to "ensure the general welfare of the public." 

The constitution is interpreted by the government and the people. However, the limits of inherent powers were articulated in ''Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer'', 343 U.S. 579 (1952)[1]. This case was a Supreme Court decision limiting the power of the president to seize private property in the absence of either specifically enumerated authority under Article Two of the United States Constitution or statutory authority conferred on him by Congress. However, Justice Black's majority decision was qualified by separate concurring opinions of five other members of the Court; this made it difficult to determine the details and limits of the president's power to seize private property in emergencies. Justice Jackson's concurring opinion provided three categories to be considered:
*Congress authorizes (express or implied)
*Congress disapproves (express or implied)
*Congress does nothing (which can invite judicial consideration of the president's actions)

'''Intermedia''' was a term used in the mid-1960s by [[Fluxus]] artist [[Dick Higgins]] to describe various inter-disciplinary art activities that occurred between genres in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/leonardo/v034/34.1higgins.pdf Dick Hggins, "Intermedia", re-published in Leonardo, vol 34, 2001, p49 - 54, with an Appendix by Hannah Higgins]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hannah B Higgins, "The Computational Word Works of [[Eric Andersen (artist)|Eric Andersen]] and Dick Higgins" in H. Higgins, &amp; D. Kahn (eds), ''Mainframe experimentalism: Early digital computing in the experimental arts'', p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

The areas such as those between [[drawing]] and [[poetry]], or between [[painting]] and [[theatre]] could be described as "intermedia". With repeated occurrences, these new genres between genres could develop their own names (e.g. [[visual poetry]], [[performance art]]); historically, an example is [[haiga]], which combined brush painting and [[haiku]] into one composition.&lt;ref&gt;''Classic Haiku'' ed. [[Tom Lowenstein]], London: Duncan Baird Publishers, 2007, {{ISBN|9781844834860}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Higgins described the tendency of what he thought was the most interesting and best in the new art to cross boundaries of recognized media or even to fuse the boundaries of art with media&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artpool.hu/Fluxus/Higgins/intermedia2.html|author=Higgins, Dick|title=Statement on Intermedia|website=Artpool|publisher=[[Something Else Press]]|location=New York|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; that had not previously been considered for art forms, including computers. 

{{quote|Part of the reason that [[Duchamp]]'s objects are fascinating while [[Picasso]]'s voice is fading is that the Duchamp pieces are truly between media, between sculpture and something else, while a Picasso is readily classifiable as a painted ornament. Similarly, by invading the land between [[collage]] and [[photography]], the German [[John Heartfield]] produced what are probably the greatest graphics of our century ...|Higgins|Intermedia, 1965, Leonardo, vol. 34, p. 49}}

With characteristic modesty, he often noted that [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] had first used the term.&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, Samuel 'Lecture 111 : On Spenser'&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gene Youngblood]] also described intermedia, beginning in his "Intermedia" column for the [[Los Angeles Free Press]] beginning in 1967 as a part of a global network of multiple media that was "expanding consciousness"—the intermedia network—that would turn all people into artists by proxy. He gathered and expanded ideas from this series of columns in his 1970 book [[Expanded Cinema]], with an introduction by [[Buckminster Fuller]].

==Academia==

In 1968, [[Hans Breder]] founded the first university program in the United States to offer an M.F.A. in intermedia. The Intermedia Area&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~interart/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060108125036/http://www.uiowa.edu/~interart/ |archivedate=2006-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[The University of Iowa]] graduated artists such as [[Ana Mendieta]] and [[Charles Ray (artist)|Charles Ray]]. In addition, the program developed a substantial visiting artist tradition, bringing artists such as [[Dick Higgins]], [[Vito Acconci]], [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Karen Finley]], [[Robert Wilson (dramatist)|Robert Wilson]] and others to work directly with Intermedia students.

Over the years, especially on the Iowa campus, ''intermedia'' has been used interchangeably with ''[[multi-media]]''.  However, recently the latter term has become identified with [[electronic media]] in [[pop-culture]].  While Intermedia values both disciplines, the term "Intermedia" has become the preferred term for [[interdisciplinary]] practice.

Two other prominent University programs that focus on intermedia are the Intermedia program&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.asu.edu/intermedia/]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Arizona State University]] and the Intermedia M.F.A.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intermediamfa.org/]&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of Maine, founded and directed by Fluxus scholar and author Owen Smith. Additionally, the Roski School of Fine Arts at the [[University of Southern California]] features Intermedia as an area of emphasis in their B.A. and B.F.A. programs. [[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec|QC]] offers a B.F.A. in Intermedia/Cyberarts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studio-arts.concordia.ca/undergraduate-programs/intermediacyberarts/]&lt;/ref&gt; Herron School of Art and Design, Indiana University, Purdue University, Indianapolis, has a M.F.A. Program Photography and Intermedia degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herron.iupui.edu/visualart/photography-intermedia Intermedia]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Oregon]] offers a Master of Music degree in Intermedia Music Technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~fmo/master/ Master of Music in Intermedia Music Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, Edinburgh College of Art [within University of Edinburgh] introduced a BA (Hons) Degree in Intermedia Arts, and intermedia can be a focus of study in Masters programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eca.ed.ac.uk/school-of-art/undergraduate/intermedia-ba-hons]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Interplanetary spaceflight''' or '''interplanetary travel''' is [[travel]] between [[planets]], usually within a single [[planetary system]].&lt;ref&gt;Interplanetary Flight: an introduction to astronautics. London: Temple Press, [[Arthur C. Clarke]], 1950&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, [[spaceflight]]s of this type are confined to travel between the planets of the [[Solar System]].

==Current achievements in interplanetary travel==

[[File:Pluto’s Heart - Like a Cosmic Lava Lamp.jpg|thumb|The plains of Pluto, as seen by ''New Horizons'' after its nearly 10-year voyage]]
Remotely guided [[space probe]]s have flown by all of the planets of the Solar System from Mercury to Neptune, with the [[New Horizons]] probe having flown by the dwarf planet [[Pluto]] and the [[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn spacecraft]] currently orbiting the dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]. The most distant spacecraft, [[Voyager 1]], has left the Solar System, while [[Pioneer 10]], [[Pioneer 11]], [[Voyager 2]] and [[New Horizons]] are on course to leave it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Spacecraft Embarks on Historic Journey Into Interstellar Space|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-277|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, planetary orbiters and landers return much more detailed and comprehensive information than fly-by missions.  Space probes have been placed into orbit around all the five planets known to the ancients:  first [[Mars]] ([[Mariner 9]], 1971), then [[Venus]] ([[Venera 9]], 1975; but landings on Venus and atmospheric probes were performed even earlier), [[Jupiter]] ([[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]], 1995), [[Saturn]] ([[Cassini/Huygens]], 2004), and most recently [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] ([[MESSENGER]], March 2011), and have returned data about these bodies and their [[natural satellite]]s.

The [[NEAR Shoemaker]] mission in 2000 orbited the large near-Earth asteroid [[433 Eros]], and was even successfully landed there, though it had not been designed with this maneuver in mind.  The Japanese [[ion drive|ion-drive]] spacecraft [[Hayabusa (spacecraft)|Hayabusa]] in 2005 also orbited the small [[near-Earth asteroid]] [[25143 Itokawa]], landing on it briefly and returning grains of its surface material to Earth.  Another powerful ion-drive mission, [[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]], has orbited the large asteroid [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] (July 2011 – September 2012) and later moved on to the dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], arriving in March 2015.

Remotely controlled landers such as [[Viking program|Viking]], [[Mars Pathfinder|Pathfinder]] and the two [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s have landed on the surface of Mars and several [[Venera]] and [[Vega program|Vega]] spacecraft have landed on the surface of Venus. The [[Huygens probe]] successfully landed on Saturn's moon, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].

No manned missions have been sent to any planet of the Solar System. [[NASA]]'s [[Apollo program]], however, landed twelve people on the [[Moon]] and returned them to [[Earth]].  The American [[Vision for Space Exploration]], originally introduced by President [[George W. Bush]] and put into practice through the [[Constellation program]], had as a long-term goal to eventually send human astronauts to Mars. However, on February 1, 2010, President Barack Obama proposed cancelling the program in Fiscal Year 2011.  An earlier project which received some significant planning by NASA included a manned fly-by of Venus in the [[Manned Venus Flyby]] mission, but was cancelled when the [[Apollo Applications Program]] was terminated due to NASA budget cuts in the late 1960s.

==Reasons for interplanetary travel==
[[File:Spacecolony3.jpeg|thumb|Space colony]]
The costs and risk of interplanetary travel receive a lot of publicity — spectacular examples include the malfunctions or complete failures of unmanned probes such as [[Mars 96]], [[Deep Space 2]] and [[Beagle 2]] (the article [[List of Solar System probes]] gives a full list).

Many astronomers, geologists and biologists believe that exploration of the Solar System provides knowledge that could not be gained by observations from Earth's surface or from orbit around Earth. But they disagree about whether manned missions make a useful scientific contribution — some think robotic probes are cheaper and safer, while others argue that either astronauts advised by Earth-based scientists, or spacefaring scientists advised by Earth-based scientists, can respond more flexibly and intelligently to new or unexpected features of the region they are exploring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://zuserver2.star.ucl.ac.uk/~iac/spaceflight.html | title=The Scientific Case for Human Spaceflight | last=Crawford | first=I.A. | date=1998 | journal=Astronomy and Geophysics | pages=14–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who pay for such missions (primarily in the public sector) are more likely to be interested in benefits for themselves or for the human race as a whole. So far the only benefits of this type have been "spin-off" technologies which were developed for space missions and then were found to be at least as useful in other activities ([http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/ NASA] publicizes spin-offs from its activities).

Other practical motivations for interplanetary travel are more speculative, because our current technologies are not yet advanced enough to support test projects. But [[science fiction]] writers have a fairly good track record in predicting future technologies — for example [[Geosynchronous orbit|geosynchronous communications satellites]] ([[Arthur C. Clarke]]) and many aspects of computer technology ([[Mack Reynolds]]).

Many science fiction stories (notably [[Ben Bova]]'s [[Grand Tour (novel series)|Grand Tour]] stories) feature detailed descriptions of how people could extract minerals from [[asteroid]]s and energy from sources including orbital [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s (unhampered by clouds) and the very strong [[magnetic field]] of Jupiter. Some point out that such techniques may be the only way to provide rising standards of living without being stopped by pollution or by depletion of Earth's resources (for example [[peak oil]]).

Finally, colonizing other parts of the Solar System would prevent the whole human species from being exterminated by any one of a number of possible events (see [[Human extinction]]).  One of these possible events is an [[asteroid impact]] like the one which may have resulted in the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]]. Although various [[Spaceguard]] projects monitor the Solar System for objects that might come dangerously close to Earth, current [[asteroid deflection strategies]] are crude and untested. To make the task more difficult, [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s are rather sooty and therefore very hard to detect. Although carbonaceous chondrites are thought to be rare, some are very large and the suspected "[[Chicxulub Crater|dinosaur-killer]]" may have been a carbonaceous chondrite.

Some scientists, including members of the [[Space Studies Institute]], argue that the vast majority of mankind eventually will live in space and will benefit from doing this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ssi.org/?page_id=2 | title=A Space Roadmap: Mine the Sky, Defend the Earth, Settle the Universe | last=Valentine | first=L | date=2002 | publisher=Space Studies Institute, Princeton | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223030553/http://ssi.org/?page_id=2 | archivedate=2007-02-23 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economical travel techniques==
One of the main challenges in interplanetary travel is producing the very large velocity changes necessary to travel from one body to another in the Solar System.

Due to the Sun's gravitational pull, a spacecraft moving farther from the Sun will slow down, while a spacecraft moving closer will speed up. Also, since any two planets are at different distances from the Sun, the planet from which the spacecraft starts is moving around the Sun at a different speed than the planet to which the spacecraft is travelling (in accordance with [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's Third Law]]). Because of these facts, a spacecraft desiring to transfer to a planet closer to the Sun must decrease its speed with respect to the Sun by a large amount in order to intercept it, while a spacecraft traveling to a planet farther out from the Sun must increase its speed substantially.&lt;ref name=curtisbook&gt;{{cite book |last=Curtis |first=Howard |date=2005 |title=[[Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students]] |edition=1st |publisher=Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann |isbn=0750661690 |page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, if additionally the spacecraft wishes to enter into orbit around the destination planet (instead of just flying by it), it must match the planet's orbital speed around the Sun, usually requiring another large velocity change.

Simply doing this by brute force – accelerating in the shortest route to the destination and then matching the planet's speed – would require an extremely large amount of fuel. And the fuel required for producing these velocity changes has to be launched along with the payload, and therefore even more fuel is needed to put both the spacecraft and the fuel required for its interplanetary journey into orbit. Thus, several techniques have been devised to reduce the fuel requirements of interplanetary travel.

As an example of the velocity changes involved, a spacecraft travelling from low Earth orbit to Mars using a simple trajectory must first undergo a change in speed (also known as a [[delta-v]]), in this case an increase, of about 3.8&amp;nbsp;km/s. Then, after intercepting Mars, it must change its speed by another 2.3&amp;nbsp;km/s in order to match Mars' orbital speed around the Sun and enter an orbit around it.&lt;ref name=marsdeltavs&gt;{{cite web|title=Rockets and Space Transportation |url=http://www.pma.caltech.edu/~chirata/deltav.html |accessdate=June 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701211813/http://www.pma.caltech.edu/~chirata/deltav.html |archivedate=July 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, launching a spacecraft into low Earth orbit requires a change in speed of about 9.5&amp;nbsp;km/s.

===Hohmann transfers===
[[File:Hohmann transfer orbit2.svg|frame|right|Hohmann Transfer Orbit: a spaceship leaves from point 2 in Earth's orbit and arrives at point 3 in Mars' (not to scale)]]
For many years economical interplanetary travel meant using the [[Hohmann transfer orbit]]. Hohmann demonstrated that the lowest energy route between any two orbits is an [[ellipse|elliptical]] "orbit" which forms a [[tangent]] to the starting and destination orbits. Once the spacecraft arrives, a second application of thrust will re-circularize the orbit at the new location. In the case of planetary transfers this means directing the spacecraft, originally in an orbit almost identical to Earth's, so that the [[aphelion]] of the transfer orbit is on the far side of the Sun near the orbit of the other planet. A spacecraft traveling from Earth to Mars via this method will arrive near Mars orbit in approximately 8.5 months, but because the orbital velocity is greater when closer to the center of mass (i.e. the Sun) and slower when farther from the center, the spacecraft will be traveling quite slowly and a small application of thrust is all that is needed to put it into a circular orbit around Mars. If the manoeuver is timed properly, Mars will be "arriving" under the spacecraft when this happens.

The Hohmann transfer applies to any two orbits, not just those with planets involved. For instance it is the most common way to transfer satellites into [[geostationary orbit]], after first being "parked" in [[low Earth orbit]]. However, the Hohmann transfer takes an amount of time similar to ½ of the orbital period of the outer orbit, so in the case of the outer planets this is many years – too long to wait. It is also based on the assumption that the points at both ends are massless, as in the case when transferring between two orbits around Earth for instance. With a planet at the destination end of the transfer, calculations become considerably more difficult.

===Gravitational slingshot===
{{main|gravitational slingshot}}
[[File:Gravitational slingshot.svg|thumb|200px|left|Simplified example of a gravitational slingshot: the spacecraft's velocity changes by up to twice the planet's velocity]]
[[File:Voyager 2 velocity vs distance from sun.svg|thumb|right|Plot of Voyager 2's heliocentric velocity against its distance from the Sun, illustrating the use of gravity assist to accelerate the spacecraft by Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. To observe [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], Voyager 2 passed over Neptune's north pole resulting in an acceleration out of the plane of the ecliptic and reduced velocity away from the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dave Doody|url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf4-1.php |title=Basics of Space Flight Section I. The Environment of Space |publisher=.jpl.nasa.gov |date=2004-09-15 |accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The gravitational slingshot technique uses the [[gravity]] of planets and moons to change the speed and direction of a spacecraft without using fuel. In typical example, a spacecraft is sent to a distant planet on a path that is much faster than what the Hohmann transfer would call for. This would typically mean that it would arrive at the planet's orbit and continue past it. However, if there is a planet between the departure point and the target, it can be used to bend the path toward the target, and in many cases the overall travel time is greatly reduced. A prime example of this are the two crafts of the [[Voyager program]], which used slingshot effects to change trajectories several times in the outer Solar System. It is difficult to use this method for journeys in the inner part of the Solar System, although it is possible to use other nearby planets such as Venus or even the [[Moon]] as slingshots in journeys to the outer planets.

This maneuver can only change an object's velocity relative to a third, uninvolved object, – possibly the “centre of mass” or the Sun. There is no change in the velocities of the two objects involved in the maneuver relative to each other.  The Sun cannot be used in a gravitational slingshot because it is stationary compared to rest of the Solar System, which orbits the Sun.  It may be used to send a spaceship or probe into the galaxy because the Sun revolves around the center of the Milky Way.

===Powered slingshot===
{{main|oberth effect}}
A powered slingshot is the use of a rocket engine at or around closest approach to a body ([[periapsis]]). The use at this point multiplies up the effect of the delta-v, and gives a bigger effect than at other times.

===Fuzzy orbits===
Computers did not exist when [[Hohmann transfer orbit]]s were first proposed (1925) and were slow, expensive and unreliable when [[gravitational slingshot]]s were developed (1959). Recent advances in [[computing]] have made it possible to exploit many more features of the gravity fields of astronomical bodies and thus calculate even [[Low energy transfer|lower-cost trajectories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://discovermagazine.com/1994/sep/gravitysrim419/article_view?b_start:int=1&amp;-C= | title= Gravity's Rim | publisher=discovermagazine.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Belbruno |first=E. |date=2004 |url=http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/titles/7687.html |title=Capture Dynamics and Chaotic Motions in Celestial Mechanics: With the Construction of Low Energy Transfers |publisher=Princeton University Press |location= |isbn=9780691094809 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paths have been calculated which link the [[Lagrange points]] of the various planets into the so-called [[Interplanetary Transport Network]]. Such "fuzzy orbits" use significantly less energy than Hohmann transfers but are much, much slower. They aren't practical for manned missions because they generally take years or decades, but may be useful for high-volume transport of low-value [[commodity|commodities]] if humanity develops a space-based economy.

===Aerobraking===
[[File:Apollo cm.jpg|thumb|Apollo Command Module flying at a high [[angle of attack]] to aerobrake by skimming the atmosphere (artistic rendition)]]
[[Aerobraking]] uses the [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] of the target planet to slow down. It was first used on the [[Apollo program]] where the returning spacecraft did not enter Earth orbit
but instead used a S-shaped vertical descent profile (starting with an initially steep descent, followed by a leveling out, followed by a slight climb, followed by a return to a positive rate of descent continuing to splash-down in the ocean) through Earth's atmosphere to reduce its speed until the parachute system could be deployed enabling a safe landing. Aerobraking does not require a thick atmosphere – for example most Mars landers use the technique, and [[Mars#Atmosphere|Mars' atmosphere]] is only about 1% as thick as Earth's.

Aerobraking converts the spacecraft's [[kinetic energy]] into heat, so it requires a [[heatshield]] to prevent the craft from burning up. As a result, aerobraking is only helpful in cases where the fuel needed to transport the heatshield to the planet is less than the fuel that would be required to brake an unshielded craft by firing its engines. This can be addressed by creating heatshields from material available near the target&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/744615main_2011-Hogue-Final-Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Improved technologies and methodologies==
Several technologies have been proposed which both save fuel and provide significantly faster travel than the traditional methodology of using [[#Hohmann transfers|Hohmann transfers]]. Some are still just theoretical, but over time, several of the theoretical approaches have been tested on spaceflight missions.  For example, the [[Deep Space 1]] mission was a successful test of an [[ion drive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/deep-space-1-ds1/|title=Deep Space 1|website=www.jpl.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These improved technologies typically focus on one or more of:
* [[Space propulsion]] systems with much better fuel economy. Such systems would make it possible to travel much faster while keeping the fuel cost within acceptable limits.
* Using solar energy and [[in-situ resource utilization]] to avoid or minimize the expensive task of shipping components and fuel up from the Earth's surface, against the Earth's gravity (see "Using non-terrestrial resources", below).
* Novel methodologies of using energy at different locations or in different ways that can shorten transport time or reduce [[cost]] per unit mass of [[space transport]]

Besides making travel faster or cost less, such improvements could also allow greater design "safety margins" by reducing the imperative to make spacecraft lighter.

===Improved rocket concepts===
{{main|Spacecraft propulsion}}
All rocket concepts are limited by the [[rocket equation]], which sets the characteristic velocity available as a function of exhaust velocity and mass ratio, of initial (''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, including fuel) to final (''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, fuel depleted) mass.  The main consequence is that mission velocities of more than a few times the velocity of the rocket motor exhaust (with respect to the vehicle) rapidly become impractical.

====Nuclear thermal and solar thermal rockets====
[[File:Nuclear thermal rocket en.png|thumb|250px|Sketch of nuclear thermal rocket]]
In a [[nuclear thermal rocket]] or [[solar thermal rocket]] a working fluid, usually [[hydrogen]], is heated to a high temperature, and then expands through a [[nozzle|rocket nozzle]] to create [[thrust]]. The energy replaces the chemical energy of the reactive chemicals in a traditional [[rocket engine]]. Due to the low molecular mass and hence high thermal velocity of hydrogen these engines are at least twice as fuel efficient as chemical engines, even after including the weight of the reactor.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

The US [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] and NASA tested a few designs from 1959 to 1968. The NASA designs were conceived as replacements for the upper stages of the [[Saturn V]] launch vehicle, but the tests revealed reliability problems, mainly caused by the vibration and heating involved in running the engines at such high thrust levels. Political and environmental considerations make it unlikely such an engine will be used in the foreseeable future, since nuclear thermal rockets would be most useful at or near the Earth's surface and the consequences of a malfunction could be disastrous. Fission-based thermal rocket concepts produce lower exhaust velocities than the electric and plasma concepts described below, and are therefore less attractive solutions. For applications requiring high thrust-to-weight ratio, such as planetary escape, nuclear thermal is potentially more attractive.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

====Electric propulsion====
[[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|Electric propulsion]] systems use an external source such as a [[nuclear reactor]] or [[solar cell]]s to generate [[electricity]], which is then used to accelerate a chemically inert propellant to speeds far higher than achieved in a chemical rocket. Such drives produce feeble thrust, and are therefore unsuitable for quick maneuvers or for launching from the surface of a planet. But they are so economical in their use of
[[reaction mass]] that they can keep firing continuously for days or weeks, while chemical rockets use up reaction mass so quickly that they can only fire for seconds or minutes. Even a trip to the Moon is long enough for an electric propulsion system to outrun a chemical rocket – the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions took 3 days in each direction.

NASA's [[Deep Space 1|Deep Space One]] was a very successful test of a prototype [[ion drive]], which fired for a total of 678 days and enabled the probe to run down Comet Borrelly, a feat which would have been impossible for a chemical rocket. [[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]], the first NASA operational (i.e., non-technology demonstration) mission to use an ion drive for its primary propulsion, is currently on track to explore and orbit the large [[main-belt asteroid]]s [[1 Ceres]] and [[4 Vesta]].  A more ambitious, nuclear-powered version was intended for an unmanned Jupiter mission, the [[Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter]] (JIMO), originally planned for launch sometime in the next decade. Due to a shift in priorities at NASA that favored manned space missions, the project lost funding in 2005.  A similar mission is currently under discussion as the US component of a joint NASA/ESA program for the exploration of [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]].

A NASA multi-center Technology Applications Assessment Team led from the [[Johnson Spaceflight Center]], has as of January 2011 described "Nautilus-X", a concept study for a multi-mission space exploration vehicle useful for missions beyond [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO), of up to 24 months duration for a crew of up to six.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=36068 Nautilus-X] – NASA's Multi-mission Space Exploration Vehicle Concept&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spirit.as.utexas.edu/~fiso/telecon/Holderman-Henderson_1-26-11/Holderman_1-26-11.pdf NAUTILUS-X] NASA/JSC Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle, Jan. 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although [[Nautilus-X]] is adaptable to a variety of mission-specific propulsion units of various low-thrust, high [[specific impulse]] (I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;) designs, nuclear ion-electric drive is shown for illustrative purposes.  It is intended for integration and checkout at the [[International Space Station]] (ISS), and would be suitable for deep-space missions from the ISS to and beyond the Moon, including [[Lagrangian point|Earth/Moon L1]], [[Lagrangian point|Sun/Earth L2]], [[Near-Earth object|near-Earth asteroidal]], and Mars orbital destinations.  It incorporates a reduced-g centrifuge providing artificial gravity for crew health to ameliorate the effects of long-term 0g exposure, and the capability to mitigate the space radiation environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moonandback.com/2011/02/21/nasa-team-produces-nautilus-x-a-fascinating-spacecraft/  "NASA Team Produces NAUTILUS-X, A Fascinating Spacecraft"] February 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fission powered rockets====
The electric propulsion missions already flown, or currently scheduled, have used [[solar electric]] power, limiting their capability to operate far from the Sun, and also limiting their peak acceleration due to the mass of the electric power source.  Nuclear-electric or plasma engines, operating for long periods at low thrust and powered by fission reactors, can reach speeds much greater than chemically powered vehicles.

====Fusion rockets====
[[Fusion rocket]]s,  powered by [[nuclear fusion]] reactions, would "burn" such light element fuels as deuterium, tritium, or &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He.  Because fusion yields about 1% of the mass of the nuclear fuel as released energy, it is energetically more favorable than fission, which releases only about 0.1% of the fuel's mass-energy. However, either fission or fusion technologies can in principle achieve velocities far higher than needed for Solar System exploration, and fusion energy still awaits practical demonstration on Earth.

One proposal using a fusion rocket was [[Project Daedalus]].  Another fairly detailed vehicle system, designed and optimized for crewed Solar System exploration, "Discovery II",&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110610051632/http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2005/TM-2005-213559.pdf PDF] C. R. Williams et al., 'Realizing "2001: A Space Odyssey": Piloted Spherical Torus Nuclear Fusion Propulsion', 2001, 52 pages, NASA Glenn Research Center&lt;/ref&gt; based on the D&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He reaction but using hydrogen as reaction mass, has been described by a team from NASA's [[Glenn Research Center]].  It achieves characteristic velocities of &gt;300&amp;nbsp;km/s with an acceleration of ~1.7•10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; ''g'', with a ship initial mass of ~1700 metric tons, and payload fraction above 10%.

====Exotic propulsion====
See the [[spacecraft propulsion]] article for a discussion of a number of other technologies that could, in the medium to longer term, be the basis of interplanetary missions. Unlike the situation with [[interstellar travel]], the barriers to fast interplanetary travel involve engineering and economics rather than any basic physics.

===Solar sails===
{{main|Solar sail}}
[[File:Solarsail msfc.jpg|left|thumb|NASA illustration of a solar-sail propelled spacecraft]]
Solar sails rely on the fact that light reflected from a surface exerts pressure on the surface. The [[radiation pressure]] is small and decreases by the square of the distance from the Sun, but unlike rockets, solar sails require no fuel. Although the thrust is small, it continues as long as the Sun shines and the sail is deployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~diedrich/cgi/search.cgi?solar+sail | title=Abstracts of NASA articles on solar sails | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311000832/http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~diedrich/cgi/search.cgi?solar+sail | archivedate=2008-03-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original concept relied only on radiation from the Sun – for example in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s 1965 story "[[Sunjammer]]". More recent light sail designs propose to boost the thrust by aiming ground-based [[laser]]s or [[maser]]s at the sail. Ground-based [[laser]]s or [[maser]]s can also help a light-sail spacecraft to ''decelerate'': the sail splits into an outer and inner section, the outer section is pushed forward and its shape is changed mechanically to focus reflected radiation on the inner portion, and the radiation focused on the inner section acts as a brake.

Although most articles about light sails focus on [[interstellar travel]], there have been several proposals for their use within the Solar System.

Currently, the only spacecraft to use a solar sail as the main method of propulsion is [[IKAROS]] which was launched by [[JAXA]] on May 21, 2010. It has since been successfully deployed, and shown to be producing acceleration as expected.  Many ordinary spacecraft and satellites also use solar collectors, temperature-control panels and Sun shades as light sails, to make minor corrections to their attitude and orbit without using fuel. A few have even had small purpose-built solar sails for this use (for example Eurostar E3000 [[geostationary]] communications satellites built by [[EADS Astrium]]).

===Cyclers===
It is possible to put stations or spacecraft on orbits that cycle between different planets, for example a [[Mars cycler]] would synchronously cycle between Mars and Earth, with very little propellant usage to maintain the trajectory. Cyclers are conceptually a good idea, because massive radiation shields, life support and other equipment only need to be put onto the cycler trajectory once. A cycler could combine several roles: habitat (for example it could spin to produce an "artificial gravity" effect); mothership (providing life support for the crews of smaller spacecraft which hitch a ride on it).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/air_space/2076326.html?page=1 | title=Buzz Aldrin's Roadmap To Mars | date=2005 | last=Aldrin | first=B | last2=Noland | first2=D | publisher=Popular Mechanics | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211195430/http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/air_space/2076326.html?page=1 | archivedate=2006-12-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyclers could also possibly make excellent cargo ships for resupply of a colony.

===Space elevator===
{{main|Space elevator}}
A space elevator is a theoretical structure that would transport material from a planet's surface into orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/space_elevator_020327-1.html |title=The Space Elevator Comes Closer to Reality |last=David |first=D |publisher=space.com |date=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104104658/http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/space_elevator_020327-1.html |archivedate=2010-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that, once the expensive job of building the elevator is complete, an indefinite number of loads can be transported into orbit at minimal cost. Even the simplest designs avoid the [[vicious circle]] of rocket launches from the surface, wherein the fuel needed to travel the last 10% of the distance into orbit must be lifted all the way from the surface, requiring even more fuel, and so on. More sophisticated space elevator designs reduce the energy cost per trip by using [[counterweight]]s, and the most ambitious schemes aim to balance loads going up and down and thus make the energy cost close to zero. Space elevators have also sometimes been referred to as "[[Space elevator|beanstalks]]", "space bridges", "space lifts", "space ladders" and "orbital towers". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Bradley C.|date=2004|title=A Space Elevator Based Exploration Strategy|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.1649650|journal=AIP Conference Proceedings|publisher=AIP|doi=10.1063/1.1649650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A terrestrial space elevator is beyond our current technology, although a [[lunar space elevator]] could theoretically be built using existing materials.

===Skyhook===

===Launch vehicle and spacecraft reusability===
The [[ITS launch vehicle]]—with first launch slated to be no earlier than 2020—is designed to be fully and rapidly reusable, making use of the [[SpaceX reusable rocket|SpaceX reusable technology]] that was developed during 2011–2016 for [[Falcon 9]] and [[Falcon Heavy]] launch vehicles.&lt;ref name=nsf20160927a&gt;
{{cite news |last=Bergin|first=Chris |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/09/spacex-reveals-mars-game-changer-colonization-plan/ |title=SpaceX reveals ITS Mars game changer via colonization plan |work=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]] |date=2016-09-27 |accessdate=2016-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nsf20140307&gt;{{cite news |last=Belluscio| first=Alejandro G. |title=SpaceX advances drive for Mars rocket via Raptor power |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2014/03/spacex-advances-drive-mars-rocket-raptor-power/ |accessdate=2014-03-07 |newspaper=NASAspaceflight.com |date=2014-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SpaceX CEO, [[Elon Musk]] estimates that the reusability capability alone, on both the launch vehicle and the two spacecraft associated with the ITS launch vehicle— the ''[[Interplanetary Spaceship]]'' and ''[[ITS tanker]]''—will reduce overall system costs per tonne delivered to Mars by at least two [[orders of magnitude]] over what NASA had previously achieved:&lt;ref name="spacex-itsvideo201609-09:20"&gt;

===Staging propellants===
When launching interplanetary probes from the surface of Earth, carrying all energy needed for the long-duration mission, payload quantities are necessarily extremely limited, due to the basis mass limitations described theoretically by the [[rocket equation]].  One alternative to transport more mass on interplanetary trajectories is to use up nearly all of the [[upper stage]] propellant on launch, and then refill propellants in Earth orbit before firing the rocket to [[escape velocity]] for a [[heliocentric orbit|heliocentric]] trajectory.  These propellants could be stored on orbit at a [[propellant depot]], or carried to orbit in a [[propellant tanker]] to be directly transferred to the interplanetary spacecraft.  For returning mass to Earth, a related option is to mine raw materials from a solar system celestial object, refine, process, and store the reaction products (propellant) on the Solar System body until such time as a vehicle needs to be loaded for launch.

SpaceX is currently developing a system in which a reusable first stage vehicle would transport a manned interplanetary spacecraft to earth orbit, detach, return to its launch pad where a tanker spacecraft would be mounted atop it, then both fueled, then launched again to rendezvous with the waiting manned spacecraft. The tanker would then transfer its fuel to the manned spacecraft for use on its interplanetary voyage.  The SpaceX ''[[Interplanetary Spaceship]]'' and ''[[ITS tanker]]'' are [[carbon-fiber]]-structure spacecraft propelled by nine [[Raptor (rocket engine family)|Raptor engines]] operating on [[subcooling|densified]] methane/oxygen propellants.  Both are very large spacecraft—{{convert|49.5|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on|adj=on}}-long; maximum hull diameter of 12 m, and is {{convert|17|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on|adj=on}}-diameter at its widest point—and is capable of transporting up to {{convert|450|tonne|lbs}} of cargo and passengers per trip to Mars, with on-orbit propellant refill before the interplanetary part of the journey.&lt;ref name=spacex-itspresentation201609/&gt;&lt;ref name=nsf20160927a/&gt;&lt;ref name=ars20160918&gt;

====Propellant plant on a celestial body====
As an example of a funded project current under development, a key part of the [[system]] SpaceX has designed for [[Mars]] in order to radically decrease the cost of spaceflight to interplanetary destinations is the placement and operation of a [[physical plant]] on Mars to handle production and storage of the propellant components necessary to launch and fly the ''Interplanetary Spaceships'' back to Earth, or perhaps to increase the mass that can be transported onward to destinations in the [[outer Solar System]].&lt;ref name=spacex-itspresentation201609/&gt;

The first ''Interplanetary Spaceship'' to Mars will carry a small propellant plant as a part of its cargo load.  The plant will be expanded over multiple [[synodic period|synods]] as more equipment arrives, is installed, and placed into mostly-[[autonomous robot|autonomous production]].&lt;ref name=spacex-itspresentation201609/&gt;

The [[SpaceX Mars propellant plant|SpaceX propellant plant]] will take advantage of the large supplies of [[carbon dioxide]] and [[Water on Mars|water resources]] on Mars, mining the water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) from subsurface [[ice]] and collecting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the [[Atmosphere of Mars|atmosphere]].  A [[chemical plant]] will process the raw materials by means of [[electrolysis]] and the [[Sabatier reaction|Sabatier process]] to produce [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and then [[Vacuum distillation|liquefy]] it to facilitate long-term storage and ultimate use.&lt;ref name=spacex-itspresentation201609/&gt;

===Using non-terrestrial resources===
{{main|In-situ resource utilization}}
[[File:Mars Ice Home concept.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Langley's Mars Ice Dome design from 2016 for a Mars base would use in-situ water to make a sort of space-igloo. See also Ice House]]
Current space vehicles attempt to launch with all their fuel (propellants and energy supplies) on board that they will need for their entire journey, and current space structures are lifted from the Earth's surface. [[In-Situ Resource Utilization|Non-terrestrial sources of energy and materials]] are mostly a lot further away, but most would not require lifting out of a strong gravity field and therefore should be much cheaper to use in space in the long term.

The most important non-terrestrial resource is energy, because it can be used to transform non-terrestrial materials into useful forms (some of which may also produce energy). At least two fundamental non-terrestrial energy sources have been proposed: solar-powered energy generation (unhampered by clouds), either directly by [[solar cell]]s or indirectly by focusing solar radiation on boilers which produce steam to drive generators; and [[electrodynamic tether]]s which generate electricity from the powerful magnetic fields of some planets (Jupiter has a very powerful magnetic field).

Water ice would be very useful and is widespread on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn:
* The low gravity of these moons would make them a cheaper source of water for space stations and planetary bases than lifting it up from Earth's surface.
* Non-terrestrial power supplies could be used to [[electrolysis|electrolyse]] water ice into oxygen and hydrogen for use in [[bipropellant rocket]] engines.
* [[Nuclear thermal rocket]]s or [[Solar thermal rocket]]s could use it as [[reaction mass]]. Hydrogen has also been proposed for use in these engines and would provide much greater [[specific impulse]] (thrust per kilogram of reaction mass), but it has been claimed that water will beat hydrogen in cost/performance terms despite its much lower specific impulse by orders of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neofuel.com/moonice1000/ Origin of How Steam Rockets can Reduce Space Transport Cost by Orders of Magnitude]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neofuel.com "Neofuel" -interplanetary travel using off-earth resources]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxygen is a common constituent of the [[moon]]'s crust, and is probably abundant in most other bodies in the Solar System. Non-terrestrial oxygen would be valuable as a source of water ice only if an adequate source of [[hydrogen]] can be found.{{clarify|date=April 2014}}&lt;!-- if ice is found, then both O2 and H2 would be available, given the energy to melt and then electrolyze it --&gt;  Possible uses include:

* In the [[life support system]]s of space ships, space stations and planetary bases.
* In rocket engines. Even if the other propellant has to be lifted from Earth, using non-terrestrial oxygen could reduce propellant launch costs by up to 2/3 for hydrocarbon fuel, or 85% for hydrogen. The savings are so high because oxygen accounts for the majority of the mass in most [[rocket propellant]] combinations.

Unfortunately hydrogen, along with other volatiles like carbon and nitrogen, are much less abundant than oxygen in the inner Solar System.

Scientists expect to find a vast range of [[organic compound]]s in some of the planets, moons and comets of the [[outer Solar System]], and the range of possible uses is even wider. For example, [[methane]] can be used as a fuel (burned with non-terrestrial oxygen), or as a feedstock for [[petrochemical]] processes such as making [[plastic]]s. And [[ammonia]] could be a valuable feedstock for producing [[fertilizer]]s to be used in the vegetable gardens of orbital and planetary bases, reducing the need to lift food to them from Earth.

Even unprocessed rock may be useful as rocket propellant if [[mass drivers]] are employed.

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[Image:VenusFlybyCutaway.jpg|thumb|upright|Apollo era interplanetary spacecraft design]] --&gt;

===Life support===
[[Life support system]]s must be capable of supporting human life for weeks, months or even years. A breathable atmosphere of at least 35 kPa (5psi) must be maintained, with adequate amounts of oxygen, nitrogen, and controlled levels of carbon dioxide, trace gases and water vapor.

In October 2015, the [[NASA Office of Inspector General]] issued a [[Effect of spaceflight on the human body|health hazards report]] related to [[human spaceflight]], including a [[human mission to Mars]].&lt;ref name="AP-20151029"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dunn |first=Marcia |title=Report: NASA needs better handle on health hazards for Mars |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20151029/us-sci-space-travel-health-6dfd5b2c76.html |date=October 29, 2015 |work=[[AP News]] |accessdate=October 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20151029oig"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=NASA's Efforts to Manage Health and Human Performance Risks for Space Exploration (IG-16-003) |url=https://oig.nasa.gov/audits/reports/FY16/IG-16-003.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |date=October 29, 2015 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=October 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--In practice on the [[International Space Station]] the [[ISS ECLSS#Elektron|Elektron]] oxygen generator unit has been temperamental. ( weasel words, compare it to some other O2 generator, or do all o2 generators require maintenance ?) --&gt;

===Radiation===
Once a vehicle leaves [[low Earth orbit]] and the protection of Earth's magnetosphere, it enters the [[Van Allen radiation belt]], a region of high [[Ionizing radiation|radiation]]. Once through there the radiation drops to lower levels,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} with a constant background of high energy [[cosmic rays]] which pose a [[Health threat from cosmic rays|health threat]]. These are dangerous over periods of years to decades.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Scientists of [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] are searching for methods of reducing the risk of radiation-induced [[cancer]] in preparation for the mission to Mars. They consider as one of the options a life support system generating drinking water with low content of [[deuterium]] (a stable [[Isotopes of hydrogen|isotope of hydrogen]]) to be consumed by the crew members. Preliminary investigations have shown that deuterium-depleted water features certain anti-cancer effects. Hence, deuterium-free drinking water is considered to have the potential of lowering the risk of cancer caused by extreme radiation exposure of the Martian crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=14959623 | volume=37 | issue=6 | title=[Consideration of the deuterium-free water supply to an expedition to Mars] | date=2003 | journal=Aviakosm Ekolog Med | pages=60–3 | last1 = Siniak IuE | first1 = Turusov VS | last2 = Grigorev | first2 = AI | display-authors = etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12575722|date=2003|last1=Sinyak|first1=Y|last2=Grigoriev|first2=A|last3=Gaydadimov|first3=V|last4=Gurieva|first4=T|last5=Levinskih|first5=M|last6=Pokrovskii|first6=B|title=Deuterium-free water (1H2O) in complex life-support systems of long-term space missions|volume=52|issue=7|pages=575–80|journal=Acta Astronautica|doi=10.1016/S0094-5765(02)00013-9|bibcode=2003AcAau..52..575S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, [[coronal mass ejections]] from the [[Sun]] are highly dangerous, and are fatal within a very short timescale to humans unless they are protected by massive shielding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/air_space/2076326.html?page=6 popularmechanics.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814163410/http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/air_space/2076326.html?page=6 |date=2007-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1350448799000633| doi=10.1016/S1350-4487(99)00063-3 | volume=30 | issue=3 | title=Shielding from solar particle event exposures in deep space | journal=Radiation Measurements | pages=361–382| year=1999 | last1=Wilson | first1=John W | last2=Cucinotta | first2=F.A | last3=Shinn | first3=J.L | last4=Simonsen | first4=L.C | last5=Dubey | first5=R.R | last6=Jordan | first6=W.R | last7=Jones | first7=T.D | last8=Chang | first8=C.K | last9=Kim | first9=M.Y | bibcode=1999RadM...30..361W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v4/n11/full/embor7400016.html nature.com/embor/journal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islandone.org/Settlements/MagShield.html islandone.org/Settlements]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://iss.jaxa.jp/iss/kibo/develop_status_09_e.html iss.jaxa.jp/iss/kibo]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yarchive.net/space/spacecraft/debris_shield.html yarchive.net/space/spacecraft]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uplink.space.com/showflat.php?Board=sciastro&amp;Number=44199 uplink.space.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040328165528/http://uplink.space.com/showflat.php?Board=sciastro |date=2004-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reliability===
Any major failure to a spacecraft en route is likely to be fatal, and even a minor one could have dangerous results if not repaired quickly, something difficult to accomplish in open space. The crew of the [[Apollo 13]] mission survived despite an explosion caused by a faulty oxygen tank (1970).

===Launch windows===
For [[astrodynamics]] reasons, economic spacecraft travel to other planets is only practical within [[launch window|certain time windows]]. Outside these windows the planets are essentially inaccessible from Earth with current technology. This constrains flights and limits rescue options in the case of an emergency.

'''Karma''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɑr|m|ə}}; {{lang-sa|कर्म|karma}}, {{IPA-sa|ˈkərmə|IPA|Karma.ogg}}; {{lang-pi|kamma|italic=yes}}) means action, work or deed;&lt;ref&gt;See:

The philosophy of karma is closely associated with the idea of [[Reincarnation|rebirth]] in many schools of [[Indian religions]] (particularly [[Karma in Hinduism|Hinduism]], [[Karma in Buddhism|Buddhism]], [[Karma in Jainism|Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]]&lt;ref name=KarmaParveshSingla&gt;{{cite book|author=Parvesh Singla |title=The Manual of Life – Karma |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1mXR35jX-TsC&amp;pg=PP5 |accessdate=4 June 2011 |publisher=Parvesh singla |pages=5–7 |id=GGKEY:0XFSARN29ZZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as well as [[Taoism]].&lt;ref name=evawong&gt;Eva Wong, Taoism, Shambhala Publications, {{ISBN|978-1590308820}}, pp. 193&lt;/ref&gt; In these schools, karma in the present affects one's future in the current life, as well as the nature and quality of future lives - one's ''[[saṃsāra]]''.&lt;ref name=jbowker/&gt;&lt;ref name=jamesloch/&gt;

==Definition and meanings==
[[File:Karma AS.jpg|170px|thumb|right|Karma as action and reaction: if we show goodness, we will reap goodness.]] 
''Karma'' is the executed "deed", "work", "action", or "act", and it is also the "object", the "intent". [[Wilhelm Halbfass]]&lt;ref name=halbfass2000&gt;Halbfass, Wilhelm (2000), Karma und Wiedergeburt im indischen Denken, Diederichs, München, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; explains karma (karman) by contrasting it with another Sanskrit word ''kriya''. The word ''kriya'' is the activity along with the steps and effort in action, while ''karma'' is (1) the executed action as a consequence of that activity, as well as (2) the intention of the actor behind an executed action or a planned action (described by some scholars&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius J. Lipner|Julius Lipner]] (2010), Hindus: Their religious beliefs and practices, 2nd Edition, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-45677-7}}, pp 261-262&lt;/ref&gt; as metaphysical residue left in the actor). A good action creates good karma, as does good intent. A bad action creates bad karma, as does bad intent.&lt;ref name=halbfass2000/&gt;

Karma, also refers to a conceptual principle that originated in India, often descriptively called the principle of karma, sometimes as the karma theory or the law of karma.&lt;ref name=karlpotter&gt;Karl Potter (1964), The Naturalistic Principle of Karma, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 14, No. 1 (Apr., 1964), pp. 39-49&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of theory, karma is complex and difficult to define.&lt;ref name=wdointro&gt;Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, pp xi-xxv (Introduction)&lt;/ref&gt; Different schools of [[Indologists]] derive different definitions for the karma concept from ancient Indian texts; their definition is some combination of (1) causality that may be ethical or non-ethical; (2) ethicization, that is good or bad actions have consequences; and (3) rebirth.&lt;ref name=wdointro/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, pp 3-37&lt;/ref&gt; Other Indologists include in the definition of karma theory that which explains the present circumstances of an individual with reference to his or her actions in past. These actions may be those in a person's current life, or, in some schools of Indian traditions, possibly actions in their past lives; furthermore, the consequences may result in current life, or a person's future lives.&lt;ref name=wdointro/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1980), in Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions (O'Flaherty, Editor), University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, pp 241-267&lt;/ref&gt; The law of karma operates independent of any deity or any process of divine judgment.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*For Hinduism view: Jeffrey Brodd (2009), World Religions: A Voyage of Discovery, Saint Mary's Press, {{ISBN|978-0884899976}}, pp. 47;
*For Buddhism view: Khandro Rinpoche (2003), This Precious Life, Shambhala, pp. 95
&lt;/ref&gt;

Difficulty in arriving at a definition of ''karma'' arises because of the diversity of views among the schools of Hinduism; some, for example, consider karma and rebirth linked and simultaneously essential, some consider karma but not rebirth essential, and a few discuss and conclude karma and rebirth to be flawed fiction.&lt;ref name=wkasrb&gt;see:
* Kaufman, W. R. (2005), Karma, rebirth, and the problem of evil, Philosophy East and West, pp 15-32;
* Sharma, A. (1996), On the distinction between Karma and Rebirth in Hinduism, Asian Philosophy, 6(1), pp 29-35;
* Bhattacharya, R. (2012), Svabhāvavāda and the Cārvāka/Lokāyata: A Historical Overview, Journal of Indian Philosophy, 40(6), pp 593-614&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism and Jainism have their own karma precepts. Thus karma has not one, but multiple definitions and different meanings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Coward]] (2003), Encyclopedia of Science of Religion, MacMillan Reference, {{ISBN|978-0028657042}}, see article on Karma&lt;/ref&gt; It is a concept whose meaning, importance and scope varies between Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and other traditions that originated in India, and various schools in each of these traditions. [[Wendy Doniger|O'Flaherty]] claims that, furthermore, there is an ongoing debate regarding whether karma is a theory, a model, a paradigm, a metaphor, or a metaphysical stance.&lt;ref name=wdointro/&gt;

Karma theory as a concept, across different Indian religious traditions, shares certain common themes: causality, ethicization and rebirth.

===Causality===
[[File:Tema Nezahat Gokyigit Park 1060584 nymphaea.jpg|thumb|240px|Lotus symbolically represents karma in many Asian traditions. A blooming lotus flower is one of the few flowers that simultaneously carries seeds inside itself while it blooms. Seed is symbolically seen as cause, the flower effect. Lotus is also considered as a reminder that one can grow, share good karma and remain unstained even in muddy circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Maria I. Macioti, The Buddha Within Ourselves: Blossoms of the Lotus Sutra, Translator: Richard Maurice Capozzi, {{ISBN|978-0761821892}}, pp 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A common theme to theories of karma is its principle of causality.&lt;ref name=karlpotter/&gt; One of the earliest association of karma to causality occurs in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad of Hinduism. For example, at 4.4.5-6, it states:

{{Quote|
1=&lt;poem&gt;
Now as a man is like this or like that,
according as he acts and according as he behaves, so will he be;
a man of good acts will become good, a man of bad acts, bad;
he becomes pure by pure deeds, bad by bad deeds;

And here they say that a person consists of desires,
and as is his desire, so is his will;
and as is his will, so is his deed;
and whatever deed he does, that he will reap.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|2=[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]|3=7th Century BCE&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6MPYs0AkA?url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/quotes/brihadaranyaka-upanishad-4-4-5-6 Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4.4.5-6] Berkley Center for Religion Peace &amp; World Affairs, Georgetown University (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jbbu&gt;The words "deed", "acts" above are rendered from karma; see [https://archive.is/20140107061016/https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/jrblack/web/SKT/DL/upanishads.html Brihadaranyaka] James Black, Original Sanskrit &amp; Muller Oxford English Translations, University of Wisconsin, United States (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The relationship of karma to causality is a central motif in all schools of Hindu, Jain and Buddhist thought.&lt;ref name=brucer&gt;Bruce R. Reichenbach, The Law of Karma and the Principle of Causation, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 38, No. 4 (Oct., 1988), pp. 399-410&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of karma as causality holds that (1) executed actions of an individual affects the individual and the life he or she lives, and (2) the intentions of an individual affects the individual and the life he or she lives. Disinterested actions, or unintentional actions do not have the same positive or negative karmic effect, as interested and intentional actions. In Buddhism, for example, actions that are performed, or arise, or originate without any bad intent such as covetousness, are considered non-existent in karmic impact or neutral in influence to the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Anguttara-Nikaya 3.4.33, Translator: Henry Warren (1962), Buddhism in Translations, Atheneum Publications, New York, pp 216-217&lt;/ref&gt;

Another causality characteristic, shared by Karmic theories, is that like deeds lead to like effects. Thus good karma produces good effect on the actor, while bad karma produces bad effect. This effect may be material, moral or emotional — that is, one's karma affects one's happiness and unhappiness.&lt;ref name=brucer/&gt; The effect of karma need not be immediate; the effect of karma can be later in one's current life, and in some schools it extends to future lives.&lt;ref name=jmpj&gt;see:
* James McDermott, Karma and Rebirth in Early Buddhism, in Editor: Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, pp 165-192
* Padmanabh Jaini, Karma and the problem of rebirth in Jainism, in Editor: Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, pp 217-239

The consequence or effects of one's karma can be described in two forms: ''phalas'' and ''samskaras''. A ''phala'' (literally, fruit or result) is the visible or invisible effect that is typically immediate or within the current life. In contrast, ''samskaras'' are invisible effects, produced inside the actor because of the karma, transforming the agent and affecting his or her ability to be happy or unhappy in this life and future ones. The theory of karma is often presented in the context of ''samskaras''.&lt;ref name=brucer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Damien Keown (1996), Karma, character, and consequentialism, The Journal of Religious Ethics, pp 329-350.&lt;/ref&gt;

Karmic principle can be understood, suggests Karl Potter,&lt;ref name=karlpotter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter's suggestion is supported by the Bhagavad-Gita, which links good bondage and bad bondage to good habits and bad habits respectively. It also lists various types of habits - such as good (sattva), passion (rajas) and indifferent (tamas) - while explaining karma. See the cited Potter reference; elsewhere, in Yoga Sutras, the role of karma to creating habits is explained with ''Vāsanās'' - see Ian Whicher, The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of Classical Yoga, State University of New York, {{ISBN|0-7914-3816-3}}, Chapter 3, particularly pp 102-105&lt;/ref&gt; as a principle of psychology and habit. Karma seeds habits ([[vāsanā]]), and habits create the nature of man. Karma also seeds self perception, and perception influences how one experiences life events. Both habits and self perception affect the course of one's life. Breaking bad habits is not easy: it requires conscious karmic effort.&lt;ref name=karlpotter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Whicher (1998), The final stages of purification in classical yoga, Asian Philosophy, 8(2), pp 85-102&lt;/ref&gt; Thus psyche and habit, according to Potter&lt;ref name=karlpotter/&gt; and others,&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Coward]] (1983), "Psychology and Karma", ''Philosophy East and West'' 33 (Jan): 49-60.&lt;/ref&gt; link karma to causality in ancient Indian literature. The idea of karma may be compared to the notion of a person's "character", as both are an assessment of the person and determined by that person's habitual thinking and acting.&lt;ref name=jamesloch/&gt;

===Karma and ethicization===
The second theme common to karma theories is ethicization. This begins with the premise that every action has a consequence,&lt;ref name=jbowker/&gt; which will come to fruition in either this or a future life; thus, morally good acts will have positive consequences, whereas bad acts will produce negative results. An individual's present situation is thereby explained by reference to actions in his present or in previous lifetimes. Karma is not itself "reward and punishment", but the law that produces consequence.&lt;ref&gt;Francis X. Clooney, Evil, Divine Omnipotence, and Human Freedom: Vedānta's Theology of Karma, The Journal of Religion, Vol. 69, No. 4 (Oct., 1989), pp. 530-548&lt;/ref&gt; Halbfass notes, good karma is considered as ''[[dharma]]'' and leads to ''punya'' (merit), while bad karma is considered ''adharma'' and leads to ''pāp'' (demerit, sin).&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass (1998), Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Routledge, London, see article on Karma and Rebirth (Indian Conceptions)&lt;/ref&gt;

Reichenbach suggests that the theories of karma are an ethical theory.&lt;ref name=brucer/&gt; This is so because the ancient scholars of India linked intent and actual action to the merit, reward, demerit and punishment. A theory without ethical premise would be a pure causal relation; the merit or reward or demerit or punishment would be same regardless of the actor's intent. In ethics, one's intentions, attitudes and desires matter in the evaluation of one's action. Where the outcome is unintended, the moral responsibility for it is less on the actor, even though causal responsibility may be the same regardless.&lt;ref name=brucer/&gt; A karma theory considers not only the action, but also actor's intentions, attitude, and desires before and during the action. The karma concept thus encourages each person to seek and live a moral life, as well as avoid an immoral life. The meaning and significance of karma is thus as a building block of an ethical theory.&lt;ref&gt;see:

===Rebirth===
The third common theme of karma theories is the concept of reincarnation or the cycle of rebirths (''saṃsāra'').&lt;ref name=jbowker/&gt;{{Sfn|Obeyesekere|2005|p=1-2, 108, 126-128}}{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=272-273, 652-654}} Rebirth is a fundamental concept of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism.&lt;ref name=jamesloch&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Rosen Publishing, New York, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pp 351-352&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been intensely debated in ancient literature of India; with different schools of Indian religions considering the relevance of rebirth as either essential, or secondary, or unnecessary fiction.&lt;ref name=wkasrb/&gt; Karma is a basic concept, rebirth is a derivative concept, so suggests Creel;&lt;ref&gt;Austin Creel (1986), in Editor: Ronald Wesley Neufeldt, Karma and Rebirth: Post Classical Developments, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0873959902}}, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; Karma is a fact, asserts Yamunacharya,&lt;ref&gt;M Yamunacharya (1966), Karma and Rebirth, Indian Philo. Annual, 1, pp 66&lt;/ref&gt; while reincarnation is a hypothesis; in contrast, Hiriyanna suggests&lt;ref&gt;M. Hiriyana (1949), Essentials of Indian Philosophy, George Allen Unwin, London, pp 47&lt;/ref&gt; rebirth is a necessary corollary of karma.

Rebirth, or ''saṃsāra'', is the concept that all life forms go through a cycle of reincarnation, that is a series of births and rebirths. The rebirths and consequent life may be in different realm, condition or form. The karma theories suggest that the realm, condition and form depends on the quality and quantity of karma.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Volume 2, Rosen Publishing, New York, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pp 589&lt;/ref&gt; In schools that believe in rebirth, every living being's soul transmigrates (recycles) after death, carrying the seeds of Karmic impulses from life just completed, into another life and lifetime of karmas.&lt;ref name=jbowker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Coward]] (2003), Encyclopedia of Science of Religion, Karma&lt;/ref&gt; This cycle continues indefinitely, except for those who consciously break this cycle by reaching ''[[moksa]]''. Those who break the cycle reach the realm of gods, those who don't continue in the cycle.

The theory of "karma and rebirth" raises numerous questions—such as how, when, and why did the cycle start in the first place, what is the relative Karmic merit of one karma versus another and why, and what evidence is there that rebirth actually happens, among others. Various schools of Hinduism realized these difficulties, debated their own formulations, some reaching what they considered as internally consistent theories, while other schools modified and de-emphasized it, while a few schools in Hinduism such as [[Charvaka]]s, Lokayatana abandoned "karma and rebirth" theory altogether.&lt;ref name=halbfass2000/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see:

==Early development==
{{anchor|Etymology}}
The [[Vedic Sanskrit]] word  {{IAST|[[:wikt:कर्मन्#Sanskrit|kárman-]]}} (nominative ''{{IAST|kárma}}'') means "work" or "deed",&lt;ref name=krishan/&gt; often used in the context of [[Srauta]] rituals.&lt;ref&gt;a neuter ''n''-stem, {{lang|sa|कर्म}}  from the root ''{{IAST|√kṛ}}'' {{lang|sa|कृ}}  "to do, make, perform, accomplish, cause, effect, prepare, undertake" [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0300/mw__0334.html kṛ,कृ] Monier Monier-Williams, [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/ Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary] (1899).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indo-aryans have borrowed the theory of re-birth after coming in contact with the aboriginal inhabitants of India. Certainly Jainism and non-vedics [..] accepted the doctrine of rebirth as supreme postulate or article of faith."

These concepts were certainly circulating amongst sramanas, and Jainism and Buddhism developed specific and sophisticated ideas about the process of transmigration. It is very possible that the karmas and reincarnation entered the mainstream brahaminical thought from the sramana or the renouncer traditions."

==In Hinduism==
{{Main article|Karma in Hinduism}}

The concept of karma in Hinduism developed and evolved over centuries. The earliest Upanishads began with the questions about how and why man is born, and what happens after death. As answers to the latter, the early theories in these ancient Sanskrit documents include ''pancagni vidya'' (the five fire doctrine), ''pitryana'' (the cyclic path of fathers) and ''devayana'' (the cycle-transcending, path of the gods).&lt;ref&gt;Colebrooke, H. T. (1829), Essay on the Philosophy of the Hindus, Part V. Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, 2(1), 1-39&lt;/ref&gt; Those who do superficial rituals and seek material gain, claimed these ancient scholars, travel the way of their fathers and recycle back into another life; those who renounce these, go into the forest and pursue spiritual knowledge, were claimed to climb into the higher path of the gods. It is these who break the cycle and are not reborn.&lt;ref name=wmahony&gt;William Mahony (1987), Karman: Hindu and Jain Concepts, in Editor: Mircea Eliade, Encyclopedia of Religion, Collier Macmillan, New York&lt;/ref&gt; With the composition of the Epics - the common man's introduction to [[Dharma]] in Hinduism - the ideas of causality and essential elements of the theory of karma were being recited in folk stories. For example:
{{Quote|
1=As a man himself sows, so he himself reaps; no man inherits the good or evil act of another man. The fruit is of the same quality as the action.
|2=[[Mahabharata]]|3= xii.291.22&lt;ref&gt;E. Washburn Hopkins, Modifications of the Karma Doctrine, The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, (Jul., 1906), pp. 581-593&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In the thirteenth book of the Mahabharata, also called the Teaching Book ([[Anushasana Parva]]), sixth chapter opens with Yudhishthira asking Bhishma: "Is the course of a person's life already destined, or can human effort shape one's life?"&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Chapple (1986), Karma and creativity, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-88706-251-2}}; see Chapter 3 and Appendix 1&lt;/ref&gt; The future, replies Bhishma, is both a function of current human effort derived from free will and past human actions that set the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Chapple (1986), Karma and creativity, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-88706-251-2}}; pp 60-64&lt;/ref&gt; Over and over again, the chapters of Mahabharata recite the key postulates of karma theory. That is: intent and action (karma) has consequences; karma lingers and doesn't disappear; and, all positive or negative experiences in life require effort and intent.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bruce Long, ''The concepts of human action and rebirth in the Mahabharata'', in Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
{{Quote|
1=&lt;poem&gt;
Happiness comes due to good actions, suffering results from evil actions,
by actions, all things are obtained, by inaction, nothing whatsoever is enjoyed.
If one's action bore no fruit, then everything would be of no avail,
if the world worked from fate alone, it would be neutralized.
&lt;/poem&gt;

* There is extensive debate in the Epic Mahabharata about karma, free will and destiny across different chapters and books. Different characters in the Epic take sides, some claiming destiny is supreme, some claiming free will is. For a discussion, see: [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr.|Daniel H. H. Ingalls]], Dharma and Moksa, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 44-45; Quote - "(...) In the Epic, free will has the upper hand. Only when a man's effort is frustrated or when he is overcome with grief does he become a predestinarian (believer in destiny)."; Quote - "This association of success with the doctrine of free will or human effort (purusakara) was felt so clearly that among the ways of bringing about a king's downfall is given the following simple advice: 'Belittle free will to him, and emphasize destiny.{{'"}} (Mahabharata 12.106.20)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Over time, various schools of Hinduism developed many different definitions of karma, some making karma appear quite deterministic, while others make room for free will and moral agency.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Coward (2003) Encyclopedia of Science of Religion, MacMillan Reference, see Karma&lt;/ref&gt; Among the six most studied schools of Hinduism, the theory of karma evolved in different ways, as their respective scholars reasoned and attempted to address the internal inconsistencies, implications and issues of the karma doctrine. According to Halbfass,&lt;ref name=halbfass2000/&gt;
* The Nyaya school of Hinduism considers karma and rebirth as central, with some Nyaya scholars such as [[Udayana]] suggesting that the Karma doctrine implies that God exists.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, C. (1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, pp. 209-10&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Vaisesika school does not consider the karma from past lives doctrine very important.
* The Samkhya school considers karma to be of secondary importance (prakrti is primary).
* The Mimamsa school gives a negligible role to karma from past lives, disregards ''samsara'' and ''moksa''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass, ''The concepts of human action and rebirth in the Mahabharata'', in Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Yoga school considers karma from past lives to be secondary, one's behavior and psychology in the current life is what has consequences and leads to entanglements.&lt;ref name=wmahony/&gt;
* According to Professor [[Wilhelm Halbfass]], the Vedanta school acknowledges the karma-rebirth doctrine, but concludes it is a theory that is not derived from reality and cannot be proven, considers it invalid for its failure to explain evil / inequality / other observable facts about society, treats it as a convenient fiction to solve practical problems in Upanishadic times, and declares it irrelevant; in the Advaita Vedanta school, actions in current life have moral consequences and liberation is possible within one's life as jivanmukti (self-realized person).&lt;ref name=halbfass2000/&gt;

The above six schools illustrate the diversity of views, but are not exhaustive. Each school has sub-schools in Hinduism, such as Vedanta school's nondualism and dualism sub-schools. Furthermore, there are other schools of Hinduism such as Charvaka, Lokayata (the materialists) who denied the theory of karma-rebirth as well as the existence of God; to this school of Hindus, the properties of things come from the nature of things. Causality emerges from the interaction, actions and nature of things and people, determinative principles such as karma or God are unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Franco (1981), [http://www.sudoc.fr/041081900 Lokayata La Philosophie Dite Materialiste de l'Inde Classique], Nanterre-Paris, France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franco, Eli (1998), Nyaya-Vaisesika, Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, London&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha's teaching of karma is not strictly deterministic, but incorporated circumstantial factors, unlike that of the Jains.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1975|p=127}}{{sfn|Bhikkhu Thanissaro|2010|pp=47-48}}{{refn|group=note|[[Thanissaro Bhikkhu|Bhikkhu Thanissaro]]: "Unlike the theory of [[causality|linear causality]] — which led the [[Vedas|Vedists]] and [[Jainism|Jains]] to see the relationship between an act and its result as predictable and tit-for-tat — the principle of ''[[Idappaccayatā|this/that conditionality]]'' makes that relationship inherently complex. The results of kamma ("kamma" is the Pali spelling for the word "karma") experienced at any one point in time come not only from past kamma, but also from present kamma. This means that, although there are general patterns relating habitual acts to corresponding results [MN 135], there is no set one-for-one, tit-for-tat, relationship between a particular action and its results. Instead, the results are determined by the context of the act, both in terms of actions that preceded or followed it [MN 136] and in terms one’s state of mind at the time of acting or experiencing the result [AN 3:99]. [...] The feedback loops inherent in ''this/that conditionality'' mean that the working out of any particular cause-effect relationship can be very complex indeed. This explains why the Buddha says in AN 4:77 that the results of kamma are [[Acinteyya|imponderable]]. Only a person who has developed the mental range of a Buddha—another imponderable itself—would be able to trace the intricacies of the kammic network. The basic premise of kamma is simple—that skillful intentions lead to favorable results, and unskillful ones to unfavorable results—but the process by which those results work themselves out is so intricate that it cannot be fully mapped. We can compare this with the [[Mandelbrot set]], a mathematical set generated by a simple equation, but whose graph is so complex that it will probably never be completely explored."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Thanissaro|2010|pp=47-48}}}} It is not a rigid and mechanical process, but a flexible, fluid and dynamic process.{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=42}} There is no set linear relationship between a particular action and its results.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Thanissaro|2010|pp=47-48}} The karmic effect of a deed is not determined solely by the deed itself, but also by the nature of the person who commits the deed, and by the circumstances in which it is committed.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1975|p=131}}{{sfn|Bhikkhu Thanissaro|2010|pp=47-48}} ''Karmaphala'' is not a "judgement" enforced by a God, Deity or other supernatural being that controls the affairs of the Cosmos. Rather, ''karmaphala'' is the outcome of a natural process of cause and effect.{{refn|group=note|[[Khandro Rinpoche]]: "Buddhism is a nontheistic philosophy. We do not believe in a creator but in the causes and conditions that create certain circumstances that then come to fruition. This is called karma. It has nothing to do with judgement; there is no one keeping track of our karma and sending us up above or down below. Karma is simply the ''wholeness'' of a cause, or first action, and its effect, or fruition, which then becomes another cause. In fact, one karmic cause can have many fruitions, all of which can cause thousands more creations. Just as a handful of seed can ripen into a full field of grain, a small amount of karma can generate limitless effects."{{sfn|Khandro Rinpoche|2003|p=95}}}}
Within Buddhism, the real importance of the doctrine of karma and its fruits lies in the recognition of the urgency to put a stop to the whole process.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=21-22}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=79-80}} The ''Acintita Sutta'' warns that "the results of kamma" is one of the [[Acinteyya|four incomprehensible subjects]],{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez Jr.|2013|p=14}}&lt;ref name="Acintita"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.077.than.html accesstoinsight, ''Acintita Sutta: Unconjecturable'', Anguttara Nikaya 4.77]&lt;/ref&gt; subjects that are beyond all conceptualization{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez Jr.|2013|p=14}} and cannot be understood with logical thought or reason.{{refn|group=note|Dasgupta explains that in Indian philosophy, acintya is "that which is to be unavoidably accepted for explaining facts, but which cannot stand the scrutiny of logic."{{sfn|Dasgupta|1991|p=16}} See also the ''[[Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta]]'' "Discourse to Vatsagotra on the [Simile of] Fire," Majjhima Nikaya 72,{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez Jr.|2013|p=852}}&lt;ref name="MN72"&gt;:[http://www.access to insight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.072.than.html accesstoinsight, ''Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta: To Vacchagotta on Fire'', translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu]&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Buddha is questioned by Vatsagotra on the "ten indeterminate question,"{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez Jr.|2013|p=852}} and the Buddha explains that a [[Tathagata]] is like a fire that has been extinguished, and is "deep, boundless, hard to fathom, like the sea".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.072.than.html accesstoinsight, ''Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta: To Vacchagotta on Fire'', transalated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In Jainism==
{{Main article| Karma in Jainism}}
[[File:Types of Karma.JPG|thumb|[[Types of Karma (Jainism)|Types of ''Karmas'']] as per Jain philosophy]]
{{See also|Causes of Karma (Jainism)|God in Jainism}}
In [[Jainism]], "karma" conveys a totally different meaning from that commonly understood in [[Hindu philosophy]] and western civilization.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Hermann Kuhn, Karma, the Mechanism, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jain philosophy]] is the oldest Indian philosophy that completely separates body (matter) from the soul (pure consciousness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dravya|title=dravya - Jainism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jainism, karma is referred to as karmic dirt, as it consists of very subtle particles of matter that pervade the entire universe.&lt;ref&gt;Acharya Umasvati, Tattvartha Sutra, Ch VIII, Sutra 24&lt;/ref&gt; ''Karmas'' are attracted to the karmic field of a soul due to vibrations created by activities of mind, speech, and body as well as various mental dispositions. Hence the ''karmas'' are the [[subtle matter]] surrounding the [[consciousness]] of a soul. When these two components (consciousness and karma) interact, we experience the life we know at present.
[[Jain texts]] expound that seven ''[[Tattva (Jainism)|tattvas]]'' (truths or fundamentals) constitute reality. These are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Acharya |last=Pujyapada |translator=S. A. Jain|title=Reality|date=1992|publisher=Jwalamalini Trust|url=https://archive.org/details/Reality_JMT |page=7}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#''[[Jīva (Jainism)|Jīva]]''- the soul which is characterized by consciousness
#''[[Ajiva|Ajīva]]''- the non-soul
#''[[Asrava|Āsrava]]''- inflow of auspicious and evil karmic matter into the soul.
#''[[Bandha (Jainism)|Bandha]]'' (bondage)- mutual intermingling of the soul and ''karmas''.
#''[[Samvara]]'' (stoppage)- obstruction of the inflow of karmic matter into the soul.
#''[[Nirjara]]'' (gradual dissociation)- separation or falling off of part of karmic matter from the soul.
#''[[Moksha (Jainism)|Mokṣha]]'' (liberation)- complete annihilation of all karmic matter (bound with any particular soul).

According to [[Padmanabh Jaini]],&lt;blockquote&gt;This emphasis on reaping the fruits only of one's own karma was not restricted to the Jainas; both Hindus and Buddhist writers have produced doctrinal materials stressing the same point. Each of the latter traditions, however, developed practices in basic contradiction to such belief. In addition to ''shrardha'' (the ritual Hindu offerings by the son of deceased), we find among Hindus widespread adherence to the notion of divine intervention in ones fate, while Buddhists eventually came to propound such theories like boon-granting bodhisattvas, transfer of merit and like. Only Jainas have been absolutely unwilling to allow such ideas to penetrate their community, despite the fact that there must have been tremendous amount of social pressure on them to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Collected papers on Jaina studies | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers | editor=Jaini,  Padmanabh | year=2000 | edition=1st | location=Delhi | pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The key points where the theory of karma in Jainism can be stated as follows:
# Karma operates as a self-sustaining mechanism as natural universal law, without any need of an external entity to manage them. (absence of the exogenous "Divine Entity" in Jainism)
# Jainism advocates that a soul attracts ''karmic'' matter even with the thoughts, and not just the actions. Thus, to even think evil of someone would endure a ''karma-bandha'' or an increment in bad karma. For this reason, Jainism emphasise on developing [[Ratnatraya]] (The Three Jewels): ''samyak darśana'' (Right Faith), ''samyak jnāna'' (Right Knowledge) and ''samyak charitra'' (Right Conduct).
# In Jain theology, a soul is released of worldly affairs as soon as it is able to emancipate from the "karma-bandha".&lt;ref name="FN2M"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=From Nigoda to Moksa: The Story of Marudevi | encyclopedia=Jainism and Early Buddhism: Essays in Honor of Padmanabh S. Jaini | publisher=Asian Humanities Press (an imprint of Jain Publishing Company) | author=Jaini, Padmanabh S. | editor=Qvarnström, Olle | year=2003 | volume=I | location=Fremont CA | pages=1–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jainism, ''nirvana'' and ''moksha'' are used interchangeably. ''Nirvana'' represents annihilation of all ''karmas'' by an individual soul and ''moksha'' represents the perfect blissful state (free from all bondage). In the presence of a ''Tirthankara'', a soul can attain ''[[Kevala Jnana]]'' (omniscience) and subsequently nirvana, without any need of intervention by the Tirthankara.&lt;ref name="FN2M" /&gt;
# The karmic theory in Jainism operates endogenously. Even the ''Tirthankaras'' themselves have to go through the stages of emancipation, for attaining that state.
# Jainism treats all souls equally, inasmuch as it advocates that all souls have the same potential of attaining nirvana. Only those who make effort, really attain it, but nonetheless, each soul is capable on its own to do so by gradually reducing its karma.&lt;ref&gt;Sancheti Asoo Lal, Bhandari Manak Mal – First Steps to Jainism (Part Two): Doctrine of Karma, Doctrine of Anekant and Other Articles with Appendices – Catalogued by [[Library of Congress|Library of U.S. Congress]], Washington, Card No. 90-232383&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception in other traditions==
===Sikhism===
In [[Sikhism]], all living beings are described as being under the influence of ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'s'' three qualities. Always present together in varying mix and degrees, these three qualities of ''maya'' bind the soul to the body and to the earth plane. Above these three qualities is the eternal time. Due to the influence of three modes of Maya's nature, ''[[jiva]]s'' (individual beings) perform activities under the control and purview of the eternal time. These activities are called "karma". The underlying principle is that karma is the law that brings back the results of actions to the person performing them.

This life is likened to a field in which our karma is the seed. We harvest exactly what we sow; no less, no more. This infallible law of karma holds everyone responsible for what the person is or is going to be. Based on the total sum of past karma, some feel close to the Pure Being in this life and others feel separated. This is the Gurbani's ([[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]]) law of karma. Like other Indian and oriental schools of thought, the Gurbani also accepts the doctrines of karma and reincarnation as the facts of nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurbani.org/webart40.htm Gurbani.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shintoism===
Interpreted as ''Musubi'', a view of karma is recognized in [[Shintoism]] as a means of enriching, empowering and life affirming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shinto: A Celebration of Life|author=Aidan Rankin|pages=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rg8UWWZPxw4C&amp;pg=PA133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taoism===
Karma is an important concept in [[Taoism]]. Every deed is tracked by deities and spirits. Appropriate rewards or retribution follow karma, just like a shadow follows a person.&lt;ref name=evawong/&gt;

The karma doctrine of Taoism developed in three stages.&lt;ref name=lkohn&gt;Livia Kohn (1998), [http://www.languages.ufl.edu/EMC/subscribers/vol4/vol4kohn.pdf Steal holy food and come back as a Viper - Conceptions of Karma and Rebirth in Medieval Daoism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109063052/http://www.languages.ufl.edu/EMC/subscribers/vol4/vol4kohn.pdf |date=9 January 2014 }}, Early Medieval China, 4, pp 1-48&lt;/ref&gt; In the first stage, causality between actions and consequences was adopted, with supernatural beings keeping track of everyone's karma and assigning fate (''ming''). In the second phase, transferability of karma ideas from Chinese Buddhism were expanded, and a transfer or inheritance of Karmic fate from ancestors to one's current life was introduced. In the third stage of karma doctrine development, ideas of rebirth based on karma were added. One could be reborn either as another human being or another animal, according to this belief. In the third stage, additional ideas were introduced; for example, rituals, repentance and offerings at Taoist temples were encouraged as it could alleviate Karmic burden.&lt;ref name=lkohn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erik Zurcher (1980), Buddhist influence on early Taoism, T'oung Pao, Vol. 66, pp 84-147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Falun Gong===
Ownby (2008) claims that Falun Gong differs from [[Buddhism]] in its definition of the term "karma" in that it is taken not as a process of award and punishment, but as an exclusively negative term. The Chinese term "''de''" or "virtue" is reserved for what might otherwise be termed "good karma" in Buddhism. Karma is understood as the source of all suffering - what Buddhism might refer to as "bad karma". Li says, "A person has done bad things over his many lifetimes, and for people this results in misfortune, or for cultivators it's karmic obstacles, so there's birth, aging, sickness, and death. This is ordinary karma."&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture&gt;David Ownby, Falun Gong and the Future of China (2008) Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Falun Gong]] teaches that the spirit is locked in the cycle of rebirth, also known as samsara&lt;ref name=TRAN&gt;Transcending the Five Elements and Three Realms, [http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/zflus.html Zhuan Falun] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609043918/http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/zflus.html |date=9 June 2011 }}, accessed 31 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; due to the accumulation of karma.&lt;ref name=kar&gt;Transformation of Karma, Zhuan Falun Lecture 4, accessed 01/01/08&lt;/ref&gt; This is a negative, black substance that accumulates in other dimensions lifetime after lifetime, by doing bad deeds and thinking bad thoughts. Falun Gong states that karma is the reason for suffering, and what ultimately blocks people from the truth of the universe and attaining enlightenment. At the same time, karma is also the cause of one's continued rebirth and suffering.&lt;ref name=kar /&gt; Li says that due to accumulation of karma the human spirit upon death will reincarnate over and over again, until the karma is paid off or eliminated through cultivation, or the person is destroyed due to the bad deeds he has done.&lt;ref name=kar /&gt;

Ownby regards the concept of karma as a cornerstone to individual moral behaviour in Falun Gong, and also readily traceable to the Christian doctrine of "one reaps what one sows". Others say Matthew 5:44 means no unbeliever will not fully reap what they sow until they are Judged by God after death in Hell. Ownby says Falun Gong is differentiated by a "system of transmigration", though, "in which each organism is the reincarnation of a previous life form, its current form having been determined by karmic calculation of the moral qualities of the previous lives lived." Ownby says the seeming unfairness of manifest inequities can then be explained, at the same time allowing a space for moral behaviour in spite of them.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;&lt;!-- Ownby 2008 p.110 --&gt; In the same vein of Li's [[monism]], matter and spirit are one, karma is identified as a black substance which must be purged in the process of cultivation.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;

Li says that "Human beings all fell here from the many dimensions of the universe. They no longer met the requirements of the Fa at their given levels in the universe, and thus had to drop down. Just as we have said before, the heavier one's mortal attachments, the further down one drops, with the descent continuing until one arrives at the state of ordinary human beings." He says that in the eyes of higher beings, the purpose of human life is not merely to be human, but to awaken quickly on Earth, a "setting of delusion", and return. "That is what they really have in mind; they are opening a door for you. Those who fail to return will have no choice but to [[reincarnation|reincarnate]], with this continuing until they amass a huge amount of karma and are destroyed."&lt;ref name=ZFLII&gt;Li Hongzhi, [http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/zfl2.htm Zhuan Falun, Volume II] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821023901/http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/zfl2.htm |date=21 August 2011 }}, published 1996, translated June 2008, accessed 2008-06-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Ownby regards this as the basis for Falun Gong's apparent "opposition to practitioners' taking [[medication|medicine]] when ill; they are missing an opportunity to work off karma by allowing an illness to run its course (suffering depletes karma) or to fight the [[illness]] through cultivation." [[Benjamin Penny]] shares this interpretation. Since Li believes that "karma is the primary factor that causes sickness in people", Penny asks: "if disease comes from karma and karma can be eradicated through cultivation of ''xinxing'', then what good will medicine do?"&lt;ref name=Fellow&gt;[[Benjamin Penny]], Canberra, 2001, [http://www.nla.gov.au/grants/haroldwhite/papers/bpenny.html The Past, Present and Future of Falun Gong, A lecture by Harold White Fellow, Benjamin Penny, at the National Library of Australia], accessed 31 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Li himself states that he is not forbidding practitioners from taking medicine, maintaining that "What I'm doing is telling people the relationship between practicing cultivation and medicine-taking". Li also states that "An everyday person needs to take medicine when he gets sick."&lt;ref&gt;Lectures in United States, 1997, Li Hongzhi&lt;/ref&gt; Schechter quotes a Falun Gong student who says "It is always an individual choice whether one should take medicine or not."&lt;ref name=schechter&gt;Danny Schechter, ''Falun Gong's Challenge to China: Spiritual Practice or Evil Cult?'', Akashic books: New York, 2001, pp. 47-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
===Free will and destiny===

One of the significant controversies with the karma doctrine is whether it always implies destiny, and its implications on free will. This controversy is also referred to as the [[moral agency]] problem;&lt;ref name=wrkaufman&gt;Kaufman, W. R. (2005), Karma, rebirth, and the problem of evil, Philosophy East and West, pp 15-32&lt;/ref&gt; the controversy is not unique to karma doctrine, but also found in some form in monotheistic religions.&lt;ref&gt;[Moral responsibility] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Stanford University (2009); Quote - "Can a person be morally responsible for her behavior if that behavior can be explained solely by reference to physical states of the universe and the laws governing changes in those physical states, or solely by reference to the existence of a sovereign God who guides the world along a divinely ordained path?"&lt;/ref&gt;

The free will controversy can be outlined in three parts:&lt;ref name=wrkaufman/&gt; (1) A person who kills, rapes or commits any other unjust act, can claim all his bad actions were a product of his karma:  he is devoid of free will, he can not make a choice, he is an agent of karma, and he merely delivers necessary punishments his "wicked" victims deserved for their own karma in past lives. Are crimes and unjust actions due to free will, or because of forces of karma? (2) Does a person who suffers from the unnatural death of a loved one, or rape or any other unjust act, assume a moral agent is responsible, that the harm is gratuitous, and therefore seek justice? Or, should one blame oneself for bad karma over past lives, and assume that the unjust suffering is fate? (3) Does the karma doctrine undermine the incentive for moral education--because all suffering is deserved and consequence of past lives, why learn anything when the balance sheet of karma from past lives will determine one's action and sufferings?&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Arthur (1976), The Problem of Evil in Indian Thought, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas&lt;/ref&gt;

The explanations and replies to the above free will problem vary by the specific school of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. The schools of Hinduism, such as Yoga and Advaita Vedanta, that have emphasized current life over the dynamics of karma residue moving across past lives, allow free will.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Coward (2003) Encyclopedia of Science of Religion, Macmillan Reference, see Karma&lt;/ref&gt; Their argument, as well of other schools, are threefold: (1) The theory of karma includes both the action and the intent behind that action. Not only is one affected by past karma, one creates new karma whenever one acts with intent - good or bad. If intent and act can be proven beyond reasonable doubt, new karma can be proven, and the process of justice can proceed against this new karma. The actor who kills, rapes or commits any other unjust act, must be considered as the moral agent for this new karma, and tried. (2) Life forms not only receive and reap the consequence of their past karma, together they are the means to initiate, evaluate, judge, give and deliver consequence of karma to others. (3) Karma is a theory that explains some evils, not all (see [[moral evil]] versus [[natural evil]]).&lt;ref&gt;Reichenbach, Bruce (1990), The Law of Karma, University of Hawai'i Press, Honolulu, {{ISBN|978-0333535592}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mdeb/&gt;

Other schools of Hinduism, as well as Buddhism and Jainism that do consider cycle of rebirths central to their beliefs and that karma from past lives affects one's present, believe that both free will (''Cetanā'') and karma can co-exist; however, their answers have not persuaded all scholars.&lt;ref name=wrkaufman/&gt;&lt;ref name=mdeb&gt;Matthew Dasti and Edwin Bryant (2013), Free Will, Agency, and Selfhood in Indian Philosophy, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199922758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological indeterminacy===
Another issue with the theory of karma is that it is psychologically indeterminate, suggests Obeyesekere.&lt;ref name=goerl&gt;G. Obeyesekere (1968), Theodicy, sin and salvation in a sociology of Buddhism, Practical religion, Editor: E.R. Leach, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; That is, (1) if no one can know what their karma was in previous lives, and (2) if the karma from past lives can determine one's future, then the individual is psychologically unclear what if anything he or she can do now to shape the future, be more happy, or reduce suffering. If something goes wrong {{en dash}} such as sickness or failure at work {{en dash}} the individual is unclear if karma from past lives was the cause, or the sickness was caused by curable infection and the failure was caused by something correctable.&lt;ref name=goerl/&gt;

This psychological indeterminacy problem is also not unique to the theory of karma; it is found in every religion adopting the premise that God has a plan, or in some way influences human events. As with the karma-and-free-will problem above, schools that insist on primacy of rebirths face the most controversy. Their answers to the psychological indeterminacy issue are the same as those for addressing the free will problem.&lt;ref name=mdeb/&gt;

===Transferability===
Some schools of Asian religions, particularly Popular Theravada Buddhism, allow transfer of karma merit and demerit from one person to another. This transfer is an exchange of non-physical quality just like an exchange of physical goods between two human beings. The practice of karma transfer, or even its possibility, is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Wesley Neufeldt, Karma and Rebirth: Post Classical Developments, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0873959902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see:
* Charles Keyes (1983), Merit-Transference in the Kammic Theory of Popular Theravada Buddhism, In Karma, Editors: Charles Keyes and [[Valentine Daniel]], Berkeley, University of California Press;
* F.L. Woodward (1914), The Buddhist Doctrine of Reversible Merit, The Buddhist Review, Vol. 6, pp 38-50&lt;/ref&gt; Karma transfer raises questions similar to those with [[substitutionary atonement]] and vicarious punishment. It defeats the ethical foundations, and dissociates the causality and ethicization in the theory of karma from the moral agent. Proponents of some Buddhist schools suggest that the concept of karma merit transfer encourages religious giving, and such transfers are not a mechanism to transfer bad karma (i.e., demerit) from one person to another.

In Hinduism, Sraddha rites during funerals have been labelled as karma merit transfer ceremonies by a few scholars, a claim disputed by others.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Wesley Neufeldt, Karma and Rebirth: Post Classical Developments, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0873959902}}, pp 226, see Footnote 74&lt;/ref&gt; Other schools in Hinduism, such as the Yoga and Advaita Vedantic philosophies, and Jainism hold that karma can not be transferred.&lt;ref name=wdointro/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===The problem of evil===
There has been an ongoing debate about karma theory and how it answers the [[problem of evil]] and related problem of [[theodicy]]. The problem of evil is a significant question debated in monotheistic religions with two beliefs:&lt;ref&gt;R Green (2005), Theodicy, in The Encyclopedia of Religion, 2nd Edition (Editor: Lindsay Jones), Volume 12, MacMillian Reference, {{ISBN|978-0028657332}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1) There is one God who is absolutely good and compassionate ([[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]]), and (2) That one God knows absolutely everything (omniscient) and is all powerful (omnipotent). The problem of evil is then stated in formulations such as, "why does the omnibenevolent, omniscient and omnipotent God allow any evil and suffering to exist in the world?" Max Weber extended the problem of evil to Eastern traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber (Translated by Fischoff, 1993), The Sociology of Religion, Beacon Press, {{ISBN|978-0807042052}}, pp. 129-153&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem of evil, in the context of karma, has been long discussed in Eastern traditions, both in theistic and non-theistic schools; for example, in Uttara Mīmāṃsā Sutras Book 2 Chapter 1;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Clooney (2005), in The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism (Editor: [[Gavin Flood]]), Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|0631215352}}, pp. 454-455&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Clooney (1989), ‘‘Evil, Divine Omnipotence and Human Freedom: Vedanta’s theology of Karma, Journal of Religion, Vol. 69, pp 530-548&lt;/ref&gt; the 8th century arguments by Adi Sankara in ''Brahmasutrabhasya'' where he posits that God cannot reasonably be the cause of the world because there exists moral evil, inequality, cruelty and suffering in the world;&lt;ref name=bilimoria&gt;P.

Other scholars&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Sharma (1973), Theodicy and the doctrine of karma, ‘‘Man’’, Vol. 8, No. 3, pp. 347-364&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that nontheistic Indian religious traditions do not assume an omnibenevolent creator, and some&lt;ref&gt;The Nyaya-Vaisesika school of Hinduism is one of the exceptions where the premise is similar to the Christian concept of an omnibenevolent, omnipotent creator&lt;/ref&gt; theistic schools do not define or characterize their God(s) as monotheistic Western religions do and the deities have colorful, complex personalities; the Indian deities are personal and cosmic facilitators, and in some schools conceptualized like Plato’s [[Demiurge]].&lt;ref name=bilimoria2013&gt;P.

Obeyesekere (I968), Theodicy, sin and salvation in a sociology of Buddhism, in Practical religion (Ed. Edmund Leach), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521055253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Indian religions place greater emphasis on developing the karma principle for first cause and innate justice with Man as focus, rather than developing religious principles with the nature and powers of God and divine judgment as focus.&lt;ref&gt;B. Reichenbach (1998), Karma and the Problem of Evil, in Philosophy of Religion Toward a Global Perspective (Editor: G.E. Kessler), Wadsworth, {{ISBN|978-0534505493}}, pp. 248–255&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars, particularly of the Nyaya school of Hinduism and Sankara in ''Brahmasutra bhasya'', have posited that karma doctrine implies existence of god, who administers and affects the person's environment given that person's karma, but then acknowledge that it makes karma as violable, contingent and unable to address the problem of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce R. Reichenbach (1989), Karma, Causation, and Divine Intervention, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 39, No. 2, pp. 135-149&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur Herman states that karma-transmigration theory solves all three historical formulations to the problem of evil while acknowledging the theodicy insights of Sankara and Ramanuja.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Herman, The problem of evil and Indian thought, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-20807537}}, pp. 5 with Part II and III of the book&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theistic Indian religions, such as Sikhism, suggest evil and suffering are a human phenomenon and arises from the karma of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;P. Singh, Sikh perspectives on health and suffering: A focus on Sikh theodicy, in Religion, Health and Suffering (Editors: John Hinnells and Roy Porter), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0710306111}}, pp. 111-132&lt;/ref&gt; In other theistic schools such as those in Hinduism, particularly its Nyaya school, karma is combined with [[dharma]] and evil is explained as arising from human actions and intent that is in conflict with dharma.&lt;ref name=bilimoria2013/&gt; In nontheistic religions such as Buddhism, Jainism and the Mimamsa school of Hinduism, karma theory is used to explain the cause of evil as well as to offer distinct ways to avoid or be unaffected by evil in the world.&lt;ref name=bilimoria/&gt;

Those schools of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism that rely on karma-rebirth theory have been critiqued for their theological explanation of suffering in children by birth, as the result of his or her sins in a past life.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley Kaufman (2005), Karma, rebirth, and the problem of evil, Philosophy East &amp; West, Vol. 55, No. 1, pp. 15-32&lt;/ref&gt; Others disagree, and consider the critique as flawed and a misunderstanding of the karma theory.&lt;ref&gt;Chadha and Trakakis (2007), Karma and the Problem of Evil: A Response to Kaufman, Philosophy East &amp; West, Vol. 57, No. 4, pp. 533-556&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:It Shoots Further Than He Dreams.jpg|alt=|thumb|''It Shoots Further Than He Dreams'' by John F. Knott, March 1918.]]
[[Western culture]], influenced by Christianity,&lt;ref name=KarmaParveshSingla/&gt; holds a notion similar to karma, as demonstrated in the phrase "[[wikt:what goes around comes around|what goes around comes around]]".

=== Christianity ===
Mary Jo Meadow suggests karma is akin to "Christian notions of [[Christian views on sin|sin]] and its effects."&lt;ref name="Meadow2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meadow|first=Mary Jo|title=Christian Insight Meditation|date=28 August 2007|publisher=Wisdom Publications Inc|isbn=9780861715268|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; She states that the Christian teaching on a [[Last Judgment]] according to one's charity is a teaching on karma.&lt;ref name="Meadow2007"/&gt; Christianity also teaches morals such as [[wikt:reap what one sows|one reaps what one sows]] ([[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 6:7) and [[live by the sword, die by the sword]] ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 26:52).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Karma, rhythmic return to harmony|author=Haridas Chaudhuri|pages=78 and 79|quote=The Meaning of Karma in Integral Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ve_Nim-MChcC&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars, however, consider the concept of Last Judgment as different from karma, with karma as an ongoing process that occurs every day in one's life, while Last Judgment, by contrast, is a one-time review at the end of life.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Collyer Knox and Horace Leland Friess, The Review of Religion, Volume 1, Columbia University Press, pp 419-427&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
There is a concept in Judaism called in Hebrew ''midah k'neged midah'', which literally translates to "value against value," but carries the same connotation as the English phrase "measure for measure." The concept is used not so much in matters of law, but rather, in matters of ethics, i.e. how one's actions effects the world will eventually come back to that person in ways one might not necessarily expect.  [[David Wolpe]] compared ''midah k'neged midah'' to karma.&lt;ref&gt;Wolpe, David.  [https://www.sinaitemple.org/worship/sermons/toldot-training-hands-esau-voice-jacob/ "Drash."] Sinai Temple.  Los Angeles, CA.  18 November 2017.  Drash.  MP3 file.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychoanalysis===
[[Jung]] once opined on unresolved emotions and the [[synchronicity]] of karma;
{{Quote|When an inner situation is not made conscious, it appears outside as fate.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C.G. and Wolfgang Pauli, The Interpretation of Nature and Psyche, New York: Pantheon Books, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Popular methods for negating [[cognitive dissonance]] include [[meditation]], [[metacognition]], [[counselling]], [[psychoanalysis]], etc., whose aim is to enhance emotional self-awareness and thus avoid negative karma. This results in better emotional hygiene and reduced karmic impacts.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Permanent neuronal changes within the [[amygdala]] and left [[prefrontal cortex]] of the human brain attributed to long-term meditation and metacognition techniques have been proven scientifically.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Richard J., Jon Kabat-Zinn, Jessica Schumacher, Melissa Rosenkranz, Daniel Muller, Saki F. Santorelli, Ferris Urbanowski, Anne Harrington, Katherine Bonus, and John F. Sheridan. "Alterations in Brain and Immune Function Produced by Mindfulness Meditation." Psychosomatic Medicine 65 (2003): 564–70&lt;/ref&gt; This process of emotional maturation aspires to a goal of [[Individuation]] or [[self-actualisation]]. Such [[peak experiences]] are hypothetically devoid of any karma ([[nirvana]] or [[moksha]]).

=== Theosophy, Spiritism, New Age  ===
The idea of karma was popularized in the [[Western world]] through the work of the [[Theosophical Society]]. In this conception, karma was a precursor to the [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] ''law of return'' or ''Threefold Law,'' the idea that the beneficial or harmful effects one has on the world will return to oneself. Colloquially this may be summed up as 'what goes around comes around.'

The Theosophist [[I. K. Taimni]] wrote, "Karma is nothing but the Law of Cause and Effect operating in the realm of human life and bringing about adjustments between an individual and other individuals whom he has affected by his thoughts, emotions and actions."&lt;ref&gt;I.K. Taimni ''Man, God and the Universe'' Quest Books, 1974, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophy also teaches that when humans reincarnate they come back as humans only, not as animals or other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;E.L. Gardner ''Reincarnation: Some Testimony From Nature'' 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kinder, Küche, Kirche''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkɪndɐ ˈkʏçə ˈkɪʁçə}}), or the '''3 Ks''', is a [[German language|German]] slogan translated as “children, kitchen, church”. It now has a mostly derogatory connotation, describing what is seen as an antiquated female role model in contemporary Western society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/de/kinder-k%C3%BCche-kirche-nein-danke/a-1284368|title=Kinder, Küche, Kirche: Nein danke!|last=Mast-Kirschning|first=Ulrike|date=3 August 2004|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|language=German|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/leben/die-besten-trios-aller-guten-dinge-sind-drei-1.73403-2|title=Kinder, Küche, Kirche|publisher=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]|language=German|date=6 January 2010|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is vaguely equivalent to the American "[[barefoot and pregnant]]" or the Victorian "A woman's place is in the home".

== The origins ==
The origins of the phrase are normally attributed either to the last German Emperor [[Wilhelm II]], or to his first wife, Empress [[Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein|Augusta Victoria]]. She is likely to have adopted it from one of several similar German "sayings by number". The most suggestive of these is listed in the second volume of ''German proverbs Glossary: A treasure house of the German people'' published in 1870 by [[Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Wander]]: "Vier K gehören zu einem frommen Weib, nemlich, dass sie Achtung gebe auff die Kirche, Kammer, Kuche, Kinder." - "Four K's are requisite of a pious woman, namely, that she keeps regard for church, chamber, kitchen, children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Deutsches sprichwörter-lexikon: bd. Gott bis Lehren |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ocM4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA501&amp;dq=%22Kirche,+Kammer,+K%C3%BCche,+Kinder%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Kirche%2C%20Kammer%22&amp;f=false|last1=Wander|first1=Karl Friedrich Wilhelm|year=1870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wander refers for the origins of this saying to a 16th-century commentary on [[Sirach]] by [[Johannes Mathesius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Deutsches Sprichwörterlexikon: Ein Hausschatz für das deutsche Volk. A bis Gothen, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FMpIAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Deutsches+Sprichw%C3%B6rterlexikon:+ein+Hausschatz+f%C3%BCr+das+deutsche+...,+Volume+1#v=onepage&amp;q=Mathesy&amp;f=false|last1=Wander|first1=Karl Friedrich Wilhelm|year=1867}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also lists another similar phrase: "Eine gute Hausfrau hat fünf K zu besorgen: Kammer, Kinder, Küche, Keller, Kleider." - "A good housewife has to take care of five K: chamber, kids, kitchen, cellar, clothes," which appeared first in the 1810 collection of the German proverbs ''Die weisheit auf der gasse: oder Sinn und geist deutscher sprichwörter'' - ''The wisdom of the streets; or, meaning and spirit of German proverbs''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Die weisheit auf der gasse: oder Sinn und geist deutscher sprichwörter |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NepLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=Kammer,+Kinder,+K%C3%BCche,+Keller,+Kleider#v=onepage&amp;q=Kammer%2C%20Kinder%2C%20K%C3%BCche%2C%20Keller%2C%20Kleider&amp;f=false|last1=Sailer|first1=Johann Michael|year=1810}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by [[Johann Michael Sailer]]. In 1844 "The newspaper for the German Nobility" published this latter saying in its traditional last page "feature" short statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Zeitung für den deutschen Adel |url=https://books.google.com/?id=df5BAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=%22Kinder,+k%C3%BCche%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Kinder%2C%20k%C3%BCche%22&amp;f=false|year=1844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase started to appear in its current form in writing in the early 1890s. "After Germany, where women apparently take no interest in public affairs, and seem to obey to the letter the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|young emperor's]] injunction "Let women devote themselves to the three K's, -- ''die Küche, die Kirche, die Kinder''" (kitchen, church, and children), the active interest and influence of English women on all great questions were refreshing." wrote Marie C. Remick in ''A Woman's Travel-notes on England'' in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Unitarian, a monthly magazine of liberal christianity |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xf0kAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=%22die+K%C3%BCche,+die+Kirche,+die+Kinder%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22die%20K%C3%BCche%2C%20die%20Kirche%2C%20die%20Kinder%22&amp;f=false|last1=Sunderland|first1=Jabez Thomas|last2=Herford|first2=Brooke|last3=Mott|first3=Frederick B|year=1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase then was used multiple times throughout the 1890s in liberal writing and speeches.

In August 1899 the influential British liberal ''[[Westminster Gazette]]'' elaborated on the story, mentioning, as well, the 4th "K". A story titled "The American Lady and the Kaiser. The Empress's four K's"&lt;ref&gt;The American Lady and the Kaiser. The Empress's four K's, in: Westminster Gazette, 17. 8. 1899, S. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; describes an audience given by the Kaiser to two American [[suffragettes]]. After hearing them out, the Kaiser replies: "I agree with my wife. And do you know what she says? She says that women have no business interfering with anything outside the four K's. The four K's are&amp;nbsp;– Kinder, Küche, Kirche, and Kleider: Children, Kitchen, Church, and Clothing".&lt;ref&gt;Paletschek, Sylvia, [http://www.freidok.uni-freiburg.de/volltexte/4725/pdf/Paletschek_Kinder_Kueche_Kirche.pdf ''Kinder – Küche – Kirche'']&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kaiser's 4 K's'' is encountered again in [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]'s 1911 book ''The man-made world''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=  Charlotte Perkins Gilman, The man-made world; or, Our Androcentirc Culture. New York, Charton Co., 1911 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=FHAuAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Gilman+The+man-made+world&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Kinder%2C%20&amp;f=false|last1= Gilman|first1= Charlotte Perkins|year= 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "3 K's" variation has remained by far more popular and well known.

== Third Reich ==

When Hitler came to power in 1933, he introduced a Law for the Encouragement of Marriage, which entitled newly married couples to a [[Marriage loan|loan]] of 1000 marks (around 9 months' average wages at that time). On their first child, they could keep 250 marks. On their second, they could keep another 250. They reclaimed all of the loan by their fourth child.

In a September 1934 speech to the [[NS-Frauenschaft|National Socialist Women's Organization]], [[Adolf Hitler]] argued that for the German woman her "world is her husband, her family, her children, and her home",&lt;ref&gt;Doramus, Max, ''The Complete Hitler. A Digital Desktop Reference to His Speeches &amp; Proclamations, 1932-1945'' (Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers, 1990), 532&lt;/ref&gt; a policy which was reinforced by the stress on "Kinder" and "Küche" in propaganda, and the bestowing of the [[Cross of Honor of the German Mother]] on women bearing four or more babies.

During this period, women were discriminated against in employment and forced out or bribed with numerous social benefits. Medicine, the law and civil service were occupations reserved for men alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERwomen.htm Spartacus Educational] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510014058/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERwomen.htm |date=2006-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his essays, [[T. S. Eliot]] reproduces and then comments upon a column in the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' of May 10, 1939 headed {{"'}}Back to the Kitchen' Creed Denounced":

{{quote|Miss Bower of the Ministry of Transport, who moved that the association should take steps to obtain the removal of the ban (i.e. against married women Civil Servants) said it was wise to abolish an institution which embodied one of the main tenets of the Nazi creed – the relegation of women to the sphere of the kitchen, the children and the church.

The report, by its abbreviation, may do less than justice to Miss Bower, but I do not think that I am unfair to the report, in finding the implication that what is Nazi is wrong, and need not be discussed on its own merits. Incidentally, the term "relegation of women" prejudices the issue. Might one suggest that the kitchen, the children and the church could be considered to have a claim upon the attention of married women? or that no normal married woman would prefer to be a wage-earner if she could help it? What is miserable is a system that makes the dual wage necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= T. S. Eliot, Christianity and Culture |url= https://books.google.com/?id=eUsTlf1F2lYC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=%22the+kitchen,+the+children,+and+the+church%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20kitchen%2C%20the%20children%2C%20and%20the%20church%22&amp;f=false|isbn= 978-0156177351|last1= Eliot|first1= Thomas Stearns|year= 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During World War II in Germany, women eventually were put back in the factories because of the growing losses in the armed forces and the desperate lack of equipment on the front lines.

The phrase continued to be used in [[feminism|feminist]] and anti-feminist writing in the English-speaking world in the 1950s and 1960s. So, notably, the first version of the classic feminist paper by [[Naomi Weisstein]] "Psychology Constructs the Female"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= N. Weisstein, Psychology Constructs the Female |url= http://www.cwluherstory.com/psychology-constructs-the-female.html |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110927130950/http://www.cwluherstory.com/psychology-constructs-the-female.html |archivedate= 2011-09-27 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; was titled "Kinder, Küche, Kirche as Scientific Law: Psychology Constructs the Female".

'''Mind-wandering''' (sometimes referred to as '''task unrelated thought''') is the experience of thoughts not remaining on a single topic for a long period of time, particularly when people are engaged in an attention-demanding task.&lt;ref name = McVay2.0 /&gt;

Mind-wandering tends to occur during driving, reading and other activities where [[vigilance (psychology)|vigilance]] may be low{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}. In these situations, people do not remember what happened in the surrounding environment because they are preoccupied with their thoughts. This is known as the decoupling hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Smallwood2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smallwood | first1 = J. | last2 = Obonsawin | first2 = M.C. | last3 = Heim | first3 = D. |date=June 2003 | title = Task Unrelated Thought: the role of distributed processing | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 169–189 |pmid=12763003 | doi=10.1016/s1053-8100(02)00003-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies using [[event-related potential]]s (ERPs) have quantified the extent that mind-wandering reduces the cortical processing of the external environment. When thoughts are unrelated to the task at hand, the brain processes both task-relevant and unrelated sensory information in a less detailed manner.&lt;ref name="Smallwood2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smallwood | first1 = J. | last2 = Beech | first2 = E.M. | last3 = Schooler | first3 = J.W. | last4 = Handy | first4 = T.C. |date=March 2008| title = Going AWOL in the brain – mind wandering reduces cortical analysis of the task environment | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 458–469 |pmid=18004943 |doi=10.1162/jocn.2008.20037}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kam2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kam | first1 = J.W.Y. | last2 = Dao | first2 = E. | last3 = Farley | first3 = J. | last4 = Fitzpatrick | first4 = K. | last5 = Smallwood | first5 = J. | last6 = Schooler | first6 = J.W. | last7 = Handy | first7 = T.C. |date=February 2011 | title = Slow fluctuations in attentional control of sensory cortex | doi = 10.1162/jocn.2010.21443 | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume =  23| issue = | pages =  460–470 |pmid=20146593 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Braboszcz2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Braboszcz | first1 = C. | last2 = Delorme | first2 = A. | year = 2011 | title = Lost in thoughts: neural markers of low alertness during mind wandering | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 54 | issue = 4| pages = 3040–7 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.10.008 | pmid=20946963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of mind-wandering research dates back to 18th century England. British philosophers struggled to determine whether mind-wandering occurred in the mind or if an outside source caused it. In 1921, Varendonck published ''The Psychology of Day-Dreams'', in which he traced his "'trains of thoughts' to identify their origins, most often irrelevant external influences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Varendonck |first=J. |date=1921 |title=The Psychology of Day-Dreams |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |location=London |oclc=32126893 |url=https://archive.org/details/psychologyofdayd00varerich }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed |date=November 2016}}  Wallas (1926) considered mind-wandering as an important aspect of his second stage of creative thought – incubation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wallas |first=Graham |date=1926 |title=The Art of Thought |publisher=Johnathon Cape |location=London |oclc=1114115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed |date=November 2016}} It wasn't until the 1960s that the first documented studies were conducted on mind-wandering.&lt;ref name="MindWandering2"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Smallwood |first1=Jonathan |last2=Schooler |first2=Jonathan W. |title=Mind-Wandering |pages=574–577 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Social Psychology |volume=2 |date=2007 |publisher=SAGE Publications |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |editor1-first=Roy F. |editor1-last=Baumeister |editor2-first=Kathleen D. |editor2-last=Vohs |oclc=192175326 |isbn=978-1-4129-1670-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CQBzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Antrobus and [[Jerome L. Singer|Jerome Singer]] developed a questionnaire and discussed the experience of mind-wandering.&lt;ref name="Antrobus1970"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Antrobus | first1 = J.S. | last2 = Singer | first2 = J.L. | last3 = Goldstein | first3 = S. | last4 = Fortgang | first4 = M. | date =February 1970 | title = Mind-wandering and cognitive structure | journal = Transactions of the New York Academy of Science | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 242–252  |doi=10.1111/j.2164-0947.1970.tb02056.x | pmid = 5265228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This questionnaire, known as the [[Imaginal Processes Inventory]] (IPI), provides a trait measure of mind-wandering and it assesses the experience on three dimensions: how vivid the person's thoughts are, how many of those thoughts are guilt- or fear-based, and how deep into the thought a person goes. As technology continues to develop, psychologists are starting to use [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] to observe mind-wandering in the brain and reduce psychologists' reliance on verbal reports.&lt;ref name=MindWandering2 /&gt;

==Research methods==
[[Jonathan Smallwood]] and colleagues popularized mind-wandering using thought sampling and questionnaires.&lt;ref name="Smallwood2003"/&gt; Mind-wandering is studied using experience sampling either online or retrospectively. One common paradigm within which to study mind-wandering is the SART (sustained attention to response) task.&lt;ref name="Smallwood2004"/&gt; In a SART task there are two categories of words.  One of the categories are the target words.  In each block of the task a word appears for about 300 ms, there will be a pause and then another word.  When a target word appears the participant hits a designated key.  About 60% of the time after a target word a thought probe will appear to gauge whether thoughts were on task.  If participants were not engaged in the task they were experiencing task-unrelated thoughts (TUTs), signifying mind-wandering.&lt;ref name="McVay2.0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Weiner |editor1-first=Irving B. |editor2-last=Craighead |editor2-first=W. Edward |title=The Corsini encyclopedia of psychology |year=2010 |publisher=John Wiley |location=Hoboken, NJ |isbn=978-0-470-47921-6 |edition=4th |oclc=528701259 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{volume needed|date=November 2016|issue=no}}{{Page needed|date=November 2016}} Another task to judge TUTs is the [[experience sampling method]] (ESM).  Participants carry around a [[personal digital assistant]] (PDA) that signals several times a day.  At the signal a questionnaire is provided.  The questionnaire questions vary but can include: (a) whether or not their minds had wandered at the time of the (b) what state of control they had over their thoughts and (c) about the content of their thoughts.&lt;ref name=Kane2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kane|first=M.

Those who were not thinking about what was given to them were considered "wandering".  Another process was to have participants keep a diary of their mind-wandering. Participants are asked to write a brief description of their mind-wandering and the time in which it happened.&lt;ref name=Unsworth2012&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Unsworth |first1=Nash |last2=McMillan |first2=Brittany D. |last3=Brewer |first3=Gene A. |last4=Spillers |first4=Gregory J. |title=Everyday attention failures: An individual differences investigation |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition  |date=November 2012 |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=1765–1772 |pmid=22468805 |doi=10.1037/a0028075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Unsworth|first=Nash|author2=Brewer, Gene A. |author3=Spillers, Gregory J. |title=Variation in cognitive failures: An individual differences investigation of everyday attention and memory failures|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|date=July 2012|volume=67|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2011.12.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; These methodologies are improvements on past methods that were inconclusive.

==Neuroscience==
Mind-wandering is important in understanding how the brain produces what [[William James]] called the [[train of thought]] and the [[stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]]. This aspect of mind-wandering research is focused on understanding how the brain generates the spontaneous and relatively unconstrained thoughts that are experienced when the mind wanders.&lt;ref name="Mason2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mason |first1=M.F. |last2=Norton |first2=M.I. |last3=Van Horn |first3=J.D. |last4=Wegner |first4=D.M. |last5=Grafton |first5=S.T. |last6=Macrae |first6=C.N. |date=19 January 2007 |title=Wandering minds: the default network and stimulus-independent thought |volume=315 |issue=5810 |pages=393–395 |journal=Science |doi=10.1126/science.1131295 |pmid=17234951 |pmc=1821121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christoff2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Christoff | first1 = K. | last2 = Gordon | first2 = A.M. | last3 = Smallwood | first3 = J.

It is commonly assumed that the [[default mode network]] is known to be involved during mind-wandering. The default mode network is active when a person is not focused on the outside world and the brain is at wakeful rest because experiences such as during mind-wandering and daydreaming are common in this state.&lt;ref name="Smallwood2009b" /&gt; However, it is also active when the individual is thinking about others, thinking about themselves, remembering the past, and planning for the future.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, recent studies show that signals in the [[default mode network]] provide information regarding patterns of detailed experience in active tasks states.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/08/23/1721259115&lt;/ref&gt; These data suggest that the relationship between the default mode network and mind-wandering remains a matter of conjecture.

In addition to neural models, computational models of [[consciousness]] based on Bernard Baars' [[Global Workspace Theory|Global Workspace theory]]&lt;ref name="Baars1988"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baars |first=Bernard J. |date=1988 |title=A Cognitive Theory of Consciousness |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |oclc=16354559 |isbn=978-0-521-30133-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=November 2016}}&lt;ref name="Baars1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baars |first=Bernard J. |date=1997 |title=In the Theater of Consciousness |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |oclc=34319776 |isbn=978-0-19-510265-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=November 2016}} suggest that mind-wandering, or "spontaneous thought" may involve competition between internally and externally generated activities attempting to gain access to a limited capacity central network.&lt;ref name="Dehaene2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dehaene | first1 = S. | last2 = Changeux | first2 = J.-P. | year = 2005 | title = Ongoing spontaneous activity controls access to consciousness: A neuronal model for inattentional blindness | url = http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10%2E1371%2Fjournal%2Epbio%2E0030141 | journal = [[PLoS Biology]] | volume = 3 | issue = 5| page = e141 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030141 | pmid = 15819609 | pmc=1074751}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual differences==

There are individual differences in some aspects of mind-wandering between older and younger adults.&lt;ref name= "Kane2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="young and old"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jackson |first1=Jonathan D. |last2=Balota |first2=David A. |title=Mind-wandering in younger and older adults: Converging evidence from the sustained attention to response task and reading for comprehension |journal=Psychology and Aging  |date=March 2012 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=106–119 |pmid=21707183 |pmc=3508668 |doi=10.1037/a0023933}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schooler2007&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Schooler |first1=Jonathan W. |last2=Smallwood |first2=Jonathan |title=Meta-Awareness |pages=562–564 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Social Psychology |volume=2  |date=2007 |publisher=SAGE Publications |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |editor1-first=Roy F. |editor1-last=Baumeister |editor2-first=Kathleen D. |editor2-last=Vohs |oclc=192175326 |isbn=978-1-4129-1670-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CQBzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT712 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although older adults reported less mind-wandering, these older participants showed the same amount of mind-wandering as younger adults.  There were also differences in how participants responded to an error.  After an error, older adults took longer to return focus back to the task when compared with younger adults.  It is possible that older adults reflect more about an error due to conscientiousness.&lt;ref name= "young and old"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Schooler2007"/&gt;  Research has shown that older adults tend to be more conscientious than young adults.&lt;ref name= "young and old"/&gt; Personality can also affect mind-wandering.&lt;ref name= "Kane2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "young and old"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Schooler2007"/&gt;  People that are more conscientious are less prone to mind-wandering.  Being more conscientious allows people to stay focused on the task better which causes fewer instances of mind-wandering.  Differences in mind-wandering between young and older adults may be limited because of this personality difference.

[[Mental disorder]]s, such as [[ADHD]], also go along with changes in different aspects of mind-wandering. In many disorders it is the regulation of the overall amount of mind-wandering that is disturbed, leading to increased distractibility when performing tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=G.

==Working memory==
{{See also|Working memory#Attention}}
One important question facing the study of mind-wandering is how it relates to working memory capacity.  Recent research has studied the relationship between mind-wandering and working memory capacity.&lt;ref name=Kane2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kane|first=M. J.|author2=McVay, J. C.|title=What Mind Wandering Reveals About Executive-Control Abilities and Failures|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=1 October 2012|volume=21|issue=5|pages=348–354|doi=10.1177/0963721412454875}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship requires more research to understand how they influence one another.  It is possible that mind-wandering causes lower performance on working memory capacity tasks or that lower working memory capacity causes more instances of mind-wandering. Although only this last one has actually been proven. Also, reports of task-unrelated thoughts are less frequent when performing tasks that do not demand continuous use of working memory than tasks which do.&lt;ref name="Smallwood2009b" /&gt;  Moreover, individual difference studies demonstrate that when tasks are non-demanding, high levels of working memory capacity are associated with more frequent reports of task-unrelated thinking&lt;ref name="Smallwood 2011 63–77"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smallwood|first=Jonathan|title=Mind-wandering While Reading: Attentional Decoupling, Mindless Reading and the Cascade Model of Inattention|journal=Language and Linguistics Compass|date=February 2011|volume=5|issue=2|pages=63–77|doi=10.1111/j.1749-818X.2010.00263.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levinson2011"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Levinson, D, Smallwood, J., Davidson, R.J. | year = 2011 | title = The persistence of thought | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 23| issue = 4 | pages = 375–380 | doi = 10.1177/0956797611431465 | pmid = 22421205 | pmc=3328662}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially when it is focused on the future.&lt;ref name="Baird2011"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Baird, B, Smallwood, J., Schooler, J.W. | year = 2011 | title =  Back to the future: auto-biographical planning and functionality of mind wandering  | journal = Consciousness &amp; Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 1604–1611 | doi =  10.1016/j.concog.2011.08.007| pmid = 21917482}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By contrast, when performing tasks that demand continuous attention, high levels of working memory capacity are associated with fewer reports of task-unrelated thoughts.&lt;ref name = "McVay2009" /&gt;  Together these data are consistent with the claim that working memory capacity helps sustain a train of thought whether it is generated in response to a perceptual event or is self-generated by the individual.  Therefore, under certain circumstances, the experience of mind-wandering is supported by working memory resources.&lt;ref name="Smallwood2013"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Smallwood, J. | year = 2013 | title = Distinguishing how from why the mind wanders: a process occurrence framework for self-generated thought | journal = Psychological Bulletin| volume = 139 | issue = 3 | pages = 519–535 |  doi = 10.1037/a0030010 | pmid = 23607430}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working memory capacity variation in individuals has been proven to be a good predictor of the natural tendency for mind-wandering to occur during cognitively demanding tasks and various activities in daily life.&lt;ref name=Kane2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alloway|first=T.P. |author2=S.E.

Mind-wandering sometimes occurs as a result of [[saccades]]. In an antisaccade task, for example, subjects with higher working memory capacity scores resisted looking at the flashing visual cue better than participants with lower working memory capacity.&lt;ref name="McVay 2012 529–549"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McVay|first=JC|author2=MJ Kane|title=Drifting from slow to "D'oh!": working memory capacity and mind wandering predict extreme reaction times and executive control errors|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=May 2012|volume=38|issue=3|pages=529–549|doi=10.1037/a0025896|pmid=22004270|pmc=3395723}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher working memory capacity is associated with fewer saccades toward environmental cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kane|first=MJ|author2=Bleckley MK |author3=Conway AR |author4=Engle RW |title=A controlled-attention view of working-memory capacity|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=June 2001|volume=130|issue=2|pages=169–183|pmid=11409097|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.130.2.169 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Unsworth|first=N|author2=Schrock JC |author3=Engle RW |title=Working memory capacity and the antisaccade task: individual differences in voluntary saccade control|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=November 2004|volume=30|issue=6|pages=1302–21|pmid=15521806|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.30.6.1302}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
Mind-wandering has been shown to be related to goal orientation; people with higher working memory capacity keep their goals more accessible than those who have lower working memory capacity, thus allowing these goals to better guide their behavior and keep them on task.&lt;ref name="four conclusions"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miyake |first1=A. |last2=Friedman |first2=N.

Another study compared differences in speed of processing information between people of different ages.&lt;ref name=interference&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rodríguez-Villagra |first1=Odir Antonio |last2=Göthe |first2=Katrin |last3=Oberauer |first3=Klaus |last4=Kliegl |first4=Reinhold |title=Working memory capacity in a go/no-go task: Age differences in interference, processing speed, and attentional control |journal=Developmental Psychology |date=September 2013 |volume=49 |issue=9 |pages=1683–1696  |pmid=23231688 |doi=10.1037/a0030883}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Kane2012"/&gt; The task they used was a [[go/no go]] task where participants responded if a white arrow moved in a specific direction but did not respond if the arrow moved in the other direction or was a different color. In this task, children and young adults showed similar speed of processing but older adults were significantly slower. Speed of processing information affects how much information can be processed in working memory.&lt;ref name= "interference"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zanto2010&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zanto |first1=Theodore P. |last2=Toy |first2=Brian |last3=Gazzaley |first3=Adam |author3-link=Adam Gazzaley |title=Delays in neural processing during working memory encoding in normal aging |journal=Neuropsychologia |date=January 2010 |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=13–25 |pmid=19666036 |pmc=2794969 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.08.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  People with faster speed of processing can encode information into [[memory]] better than people that have slower speed of processing. This can lead to memory of more items because more things can be encoded.

==Retention==
Mind-wandering affects retention where working memory capacity is directly related to reading comprehension levels. Participants with lower working memory capacity perform worse on comprehension-based tests.&lt;ref name="Kane2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smallwood 2011 63–77"/&gt; 
When investigating how mind-wandering affects retention of information, experiments are conducted where participants are asked a variety of questions about factual information, or deducible information while reading a detective novel. Participants are also asked about the state of their mind before the questions are asked. Throughout the reading itself, the author provides important cues to identify the villain, known as inference critical episodes (ICEs). The questions are asked randomly and before critical episodes are reached. It was found that episodes of mind-wandering, especially early on in the text led to decreased identification of the villain and worse results on both factual and deducible questions. Therefore, when mind-wandering occurs during reading, the text is not processed well enough to remember key information about the story. Furthermore, both the timing and the frequency of mind-wandering helps determine how much information is retained from the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smallwood |first1=Jonathan |last2=McSpadden |first2=Merrill |last3=Schooler |first3=Jonathan W. |title=When attention matters: The curious incident of the wandering mind |journal=Memory &amp; Cognition |date=September 2008 |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=1144–1150 |pmid=18927032 |doi=10.3758/MC.36.6.1144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Secondary Source"&gt;{{cite  encyclopedia |last=Smallwood |first=J. |title=Mind Wandering and Other Lapses |url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/estcon/mind_wandering_and_other_lapses | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Consciousness |edition=1st |volume=2 |editor-last=Banks |editor-first=William P. |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |oclc=656164369 |subscription=yes |via=Credo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reading comprehension==
Reading comprehension must also be investigated in terms of text difficulty. To assess this, researchers provide an easy and hard version of a reading task. During this task, participants are interrupted and asked whether their thoughts at the time of interruption had been related or unrelated to the task. What is found is that mind-wandering has a negative effect on text comprehension in more difficult readings. This supports the executive-resource hypothesis which describes that both task related and task-unrelated thoughts (TUT) compete for executive function resources. Therefore, when the primary task is difficult, little resources are available for mind-wandering, whereas when the task is simple, the possibility for mind-wandering is abundant because it takes little executive control to focus on simple tasks. However, mind-wandering tends to occur more frequently in harder readings as opposed to easier readings. Therefore, it is possible that similar to retention, mind-wandering increases when readers have difficulty constructing a model of the story.&lt;ref name="Secondary Source" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Feng |first1=S. |last2=D'Mello |first2=S. |last3=Graesser, |first3=A.C. |title=Mind wandering while reading easy and difficult texts |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review |date=June 2013 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=586–592 |pmid=23288660 |doi=10.3758/s13423-012-0367-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Happiness==

As part of his doctoral research at Harvard University, [[Matthew Killingsworth]] used an iPhone app that captured a user's feelings in real time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About us |website=Track Your Happiness |url=https://www.trackyourhappiness.org/about |access-date=3 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jeremy |last=Hsu |date=11 November 2010 |title=Mind Wandering May Lead to a Bad Mood |website=[[LiveScience]] |publisher=Purch |url=http://www.livescience.com/8923-mind-wandering-lead-bad-mood.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tool alerts the user at random times and asks: "How are you feeling right now?" and "What are you doing right now?"&lt;ref name=KillingsworthGilbert2010&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Matthew A.

They also describe that people were less happy when their minds were wandering than when they were otherwise occupied. This effect was somewhat counteracted by people's tendency to mind-wander to happy topics, but unhappy mind-wandering was more likely to be rated as more unpleasant than other activities.   The authors note that unhappy moods can also cause mind-wandering, but the time-lags between mind-wandering and mood suggests that mind-wandering itself can also lead to negative moods.&lt;ref name = KillingsworthGilbert2010 /&gt; Furthermore, research suggests that regardless of working memory capacity, participants participating in mind-wandering experiments report more mind-wandering when bored, stressed, unhappy.&lt;ref name=Kane2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Secondary Source" /&gt;

== Decision-making ==
People can [[Decision-making|make decisions]] by mind-wandering, for example, looking at a set of art posters until the most desirable comes to mind. In contrast to people's belief that the choices they make while mind-wandering will be worse than the choices made though more careful deliberation over choice options, people appear to be as happy with choices made by mind-wandering as with choices made by engaging in more careful deliberation. Giblin, Morewedge, and Norton (2013) conducted two experiments in which participants judged the value of a poster chosen through conscious deliberation, mind-wandering, or random assignment. Forecasters in a first experiment predicted that participants would like and value the art poster they chose in the deliberation condition most, that they would like and value the poster chose by mind-wandering less, and they would like and value the poster to which they were randomly assigned least of the three methods. By contrast, in an [[Incentive compatibility|incentive-compatible]] second experiment, participants who chose a poster by one of these three methods (via random assignment) liked and valued the poster they chose as much in the deciding by mind-wandering condition as in the deciding by deliberation condition. Participants in the random assignment condition liked and valued their poster least.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Unexpected benefits of deciding by mind wandering|url = http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00598/abstract|journal = Perception Science|date = 2013-01-01|pmc = 3764397|pmid = 24046760|pages = 598|volume = 4|doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00598|first = Colleen Elizabeth|last = Giblin|first2 = Carey Karim|last2 = Morewedge|first3 = Michael Irwin|last3 = Norton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''monodomain model''' is a reduction of the [[bidomain model]] of the electrical propagation in myocardial tissue.
The reduction comes from assuming that the intra- and extracellular domains have equal anisotropy ratios.
Although not as physiologically accurate as the [[Bidomain|bidomain model]], it is still adequate in some cases, and has reduced complexity.

==Formulation==
The monodomain model can be formulated as follows&lt;ref name=KeenerSneyd&gt;{{cite book
 | author = Keener J, Sneyd J
 | year = 2009
 | edition = 2nd
 | title =  Mathematical Physiology II: Systems Physiology
 | publisher = Springer
 | isbn = 978-0-387-79387-0
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{\lambda}{1+\lambda} \nabla \cdot \left(\mathbf\Sigma_i \nabla v \right) = \chi \left( C_m \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + I_\text{ion} \right)
,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\Sigma_i&lt;/math&gt; is the intracellular conductivity tensor, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the transmembrane potential, &lt;math&gt;I_\text{ion}&lt;/math&gt; is the transmembrane ionic current per unit area, &lt;math&gt;C_m&lt;/math&gt; is the membrane conductivity per unit area, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the intra- to extracellular conductivity ratio, and &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; is the membrane surface area per unit volume (of tissue).

==Derivation==
The [[Bidomain|bidomain model]] can be written as
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nabla \cdot \left(\mathbf\Sigma_i \nabla v \right) + \nabla \cdot \left(\mathbf\Sigma_i \nabla v_e \right) &amp; = \chi \left( C_m \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + I_\text{ion} \right) \\
\nabla \cdot \left( \mathbf\Sigma_i \nabla v \right) + \nabla \cdot \left( \left( \mathbf\Sigma_i + \mathbf\Sigma_e \right) \nabla v_e \right) &amp; = 0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming equal anisotropy ratios, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\Sigma_e = \lambda\mathbf\Sigma_i&lt;/math&gt;, the second equation can be written
: &lt;math&gt;
\nabla \cdot \left(\mathbf\Sigma_i\nabla v_e\right) = -\frac{1}{1+\lambda}\nabla\cdot\left(\mathbf\Sigma_i\nabla v\right) 
.&lt;/math&gt;

Inserting this into the first bidomain equation gives
: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{\lambda}{1+\lambda} \nabla \cdot \left(\mathbf\Sigma_i \nabla v \right) = \chi \left( C_m \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + I_\text{ion} \right)
.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4866">The '''"Appeal to womanhood throughout the world"'''&lt;ref name="appeal"/&gt; (later known as '''"Mother's Day Proclamation"''') by [[Julia Ward Howe]] was an appeal for women to unite for peace in the world. Written in 1870, Howe's "Appeal to womanhood" was a pacifist reaction to the carnage of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. The appeal was tied to Howe's [[feminist]] conviction that women had a responsibility to shape their societies at the political level.

In 1872 Howe asked for the celebration of a "Mother's Day for Peace" on 2 June of every year, but she was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="leigh"&gt;{{cite book | title = Consumer Rites: The Buying and Selling of American Holidays | author = LEIGH Eric Schmidt | edition = reprint, illustrated | editor = [[Princeton University Press]] | year = 1997 | pages = 252, 348 (footnote 17 of chapter 5) | isbn = 978-0-691-01721-1 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=maF8mTPsJqsC }} citing Deborah Pickman Clifford, ''Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory: A Biography of Julia Ward Howe (Boston: Little, Brown, 1979), 187, 207, and Julia Ward Howe, "How the Fourth of July Should Be Celebrated", ''Forum'' 15 (July 1983); 574&lt;/ref&gt; The modern [[Mother's Day]] is an unrelated celebration and it was established by [[Anna Jarvis]] years later.&lt;ref name="leigh"/&gt;

Today, the appeal is included in the [[Unitarian Universalist]] hymnal ''[[Singing the Living Tradition]]''.

==Appeal to womanhood throughout the world==
{{quote|1=Again, in the sight of the Christian world, have the skill and power of two great nations exhausted themselves in mutual murder. Again have the sacred questions of international justice been committed to the fatal mediation of military weapons. In this day of progress, in this century of light, the ambition of rulers has been allowed to barter the dear interests of domestic life for the bloody exchanges of the battle field. Thus men have done. Thus men will do. But women need no longer be made a party to proceedings which fill the globe with grief and horror. Despite the assumptions of physical force, the mother has a sacred and commanding word to say to the sons who owe their life to her suffering. That word should now be heard, and answered to as never before.

Arise, then, Christian women of this day ! Arise, all women who have hearts, Whether your baptism be that of water or of tears ! Say firmly : We will not have great questions decided by irrelevant agencies. Our husbands shall not come to us, reeking with carnage, for caresses and applause. Our sons shall not be taken from us to unlearn all that we have been able to teach them of charity, mercy and patience. We, women of one country, will be too tender of those of another country, to allow our sons to be trained to injure theirs. From the bosom of the devastated earth a voice goes up with our own. It says: Disarm, disarm! The sword of murder is not the balance of justice. Blood does not wipe out dishonor, nor violence vindicate possession. As men have often forsaken the plough and the anvil at the summons of war, let women now leave all that may be left of home for a great and earnest day of council.

Let them meet first, as women, to bewail and commemorate the dead. Let them then solemnly take council with each other as to the means whereby the great human family can live in peace, man as the brother of man, each bearing after his own kind the sacred impress, not of Caesar, but of God.

In the name of womanhood and of humanity, I earnestly ask that a general congress of women, without limit of nationality, may be appointed and held at some place deemed most convenient, and at the earliest period consistent with its objects, to promote the alliance of the different nationalities, the amicable settlement of international questions, the great and general interests of peace.|2=Julia Ward Howe&lt;ref name="appeal"&gt;{{citation |title= Appeal to womanhood throughout the world |publisher= Library of Congress |author= Julia Ward Howe |date= September 1870 |work= An American Time Capsule: Three Centuries of Broadsides and Other Printed Ephemera |url= http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/h?ammem/rbpebib:@field(NUMBER+@band(rbpe+07400300))}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Julia Ward.

'''National Public Lands Day''' is celebrated annually at public lands in the [[United States]] on the fourth Saturday of September.  A signature event of the [[National Environmental Education Foundation]], it promotes both popular enjoyment and [[Volunteering|volunteer]] conservation of [[public land]]s.

Three federal agencies and 700 volunteers launched the first National Public Lands Day in 1994.  By 2010, participation grew to 170,000 volunteers at over 2,000 sites across the country, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories.&lt;ref name="National Public Lands Day Draws Record Numbers of Volunteers Coast-to-Coast"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.neefusa.org/npld|title=National Public Lands Day|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=NEEFusa.org|accessdate=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to National Public Lands Day being a fee-free day (free entry day) at many federally managed lands, volunteers who participate at federal land sites are rewarded with coupons for free entry into their favorite federal public land areas that have entrance fees.&lt;ref name="BLM20080821"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.blm.gov/nv/st/en/res/national_public_lands.html| title=Helping Hands for America's Lands| publisher=[[Bureau of Land Management]]| date=2008-08-21 |accessdate=2008-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 event featured an initiative to plant one million trees in honor of the 75th anniversary of the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]].&lt;ref name="Civilian Conservation Corps"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.publiclandsday.org/partners/civilian-conservation-corps| title=Civilian Conservation Corps| publisher=PublicLandsDay.org| accessdate=2011-07-12| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005060340/http://www.publiclandsday.org/partners/civilian-conservation-corps| archivedate=2011-10-05| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This goal was exceeded, with more than 1.6 million trees planted. The 2009 event featured a [[Preview screening|preview]] of ''[[The National Parks: America's Best Idea]]'', which began airing the next night on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] stations nationwide.  The preview was sent to each [[national park (US)|national park]] on [[DVD]] and aired in their [[visitor center]] [[auditorium]]s. Other National Public Lands Day events occurred on September 24, 2011 and  September 29, 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3013">[[File:Sphere wireframe 10deg 6r.svg|thumb|The [[Sphere|2-sphere]] is usually considered as a [[Subspace topology|subspace]] of 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], so its natural topology is inherited from the [[Euclidean topology]].]]
In any domain of [[mathematics]], a space has a '''natural topology''' if there is a [[topology]] on the space which is "best adapted" to its study within the domain in question. In many cases this imprecise definition means little more than the assertion that the topology in question arises ''naturally'' or ''canonically'' (see [[mathematical jargon]]) in the given context.
 
Note that in some cases multiple topologies seem "natural". For example, if ''Y'' is a subset of a [[total order|totally ordered]] set ''X'', then the [[Order_topology#Induced_order_topology|induced order topology]], i.e. the [[order topology]] of the totally ordered ''Y'', where this order is inherited from ''X'', is coarser than the [[subspace topology]] of the order topology of ''X''.

"Natural topology" does quite often have a more specific meaning, at least given some prior contextual information: the natural topology is a topology which makes a natural map or collection of maps [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous]]. This is still imprecise, even once one has specified what the natural maps are, because there may be many topologies with the required property. However, there is often a [[finest topology|finest]] or [[coarsest topology|coarsest]] topology which makes the given maps continuous, in which case these are obvious candidates for ''the'' natural topology.

The simplest cases (which nevertheless cover ''many'' examples) are the [[initial topology]] and the [[final topology]] (Willard (1970)). The initial topology is the coarsest topology on a space ''X'' which makes a given collection of maps from ''X'' to topological spaces ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; continuous. The final topology is the finest topology on a space ''X'' which makes a given collection of maps from topological spaces ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''X'' continuous.

Two of the simplest examples are the natural topologies of subspaces and quotient spaces.
* The natural topology on a [[subset]] of a topological space is the [[subspace topology]]. This is the coarsest topology which makes the [[inclusion map]] continuous.
* The natural topology on a [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient]] of a topological space is the [[quotient topology]]. This is the finest topology which makes the [[quotient map]] continuous.

Another example is that any metric space has a natural topology [[Metric_space#Open_and_closed_sets,_topology_and_convergence|induced by its metric]].

      <comment>/* Adults */ Correct typos "willing" -&gt; "winning"; "in 10,000 chance" -&gt; "a one in 10,000 chance"</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12800">The '''neglect of probability''', a type of [[cognitive bias]], is the tendency to disregard [[probability]] when making a decision under uncertainty and is one simple way in which people regularly violate the normative rules for decision making. Small risks are typically either neglected entirely or hugely overrated. The continuum between the extremes is ignored. The term '''probability neglect''' was coined by [[Cass Sunstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Kahneman, D. (2011). [http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780141918921,00.html Thinking Fast and Slow], Allen Lane 2011, p. 143 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many related ways in which people violate the normative rules of decision making with regard to probability including the [[hindsight bias]], the [[neglect of prior base rates effect]], and the [[gambler's fallacy]]. However, this bias is different in that rather than incorrectly using probability, the actor disregards it.

"We have no intuitive grasp of risk and thus distinguish poorly among different threats," Dobelli has written. "The more serious the threat and the more emotional the topic (such as radioactivity), the less reassuring a reduction in risk seems to us."&lt;ref name="Meaning Ring"/&gt;

==Studies==
===Adults===
In a 1972 experiment, participants were divided into two groups, with the former being told they would receive a mild electric shock and the latter told that there was a 50 percent chance they would receive such a shock. When the subjects' physical anxiety was measured, there was no difference between the two groups. This lack of difference remained even when the second group's chance of being shocked was lowered to 20 percent, then ten, then five. The conclusion: "we respond to the expected magnitude of an event...but not to its likelihood. In other words: We lack an intuitive grasp of probability."&lt;ref name="Meaning Ring"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why You’ll Soon Be Playing Mega Trillions|url=http://meaningring.com/2016/03/28/neglect-of-probability-by-rolf-dobelli/|website=Meaning Ring|publisher=Meaning Ring|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron (2000) suggests that the bias manifests itself among adults especially when it comes to difficult choices, such as medical decisions. This bias could make actors drastically violate expected-utility theory in their decision making, especially when a decision must be made in which one possible outcome has a much lower or higher utility but a small probability of occurring (e.g. in medical or gambling situations). In this aspect, the neglect of probability bias is similar to the [[neglect of prior base rates effect]].

Cass Sunstein has cited the history of [[Love Canal]] in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]], which became world-famous in the late 1970s owing to widely publicized public concerns about abandoned waste that was supposedly causing medical problems in the area. In response to these concerns, the U.S. federal government set in motion "an aggressive program for cleaning up abandoned hazardous waste sites, without examining the probability that illness would actually occur," and legislation was passed that did not reflect serious study of the actual degree of danger. Furthermore, when controlled studies were publicized showing little evidence that the waste represented a menace to public health, the anxiety of local residents did not diminish.&lt;ref name="Sunstein"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sunstein|first1=Cass|title=Probability Neglect: Emotions, Worst Cases, and Law|date=November 2001|ssrn=292149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One [[University of Chicago]] study showed that people are as afraid of a 1% chance as of a 99% chance of contamination by poisonous chemicals.&lt;ref name="Meaning Ring"/&gt; In another example of near-total neglect of probability, Rottenstreich and Hsee (2001) found that the typical subject was willing to pay $10 to avoid a 99% chance of a painful electric shock, and $7 to avoid a 1% chance of the same shock. They suggest that probability is more likely to be neglected when the outcomes are emotion-arousing.

David Minger cites the [[anti-vaccination movement]] as an example of the neglect of probability. On the one hand, the odds of a child experiencing a severe allergic reaction to the [[MMR vaccine]], which prevents [[mumps]], [[measles]], and [[rubella]], are about 1 in a million; on the other hand, one in four measles patients will require hospitalization, one in a thousand will develop [[encephalitis]], and one or two out of a thousand will die. Nonetheless, many parents reject the vaccine.&lt;ref name="Minger"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Minger|first1=David|title=Why is neglect of probability a cognitive bias?|url=https://www.quora.com/Why-is-neglect-of-probability-a-cognitive-bias|website=Quora|publisher=Quora|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Tom Cagley noted that neglect of probability is "common in [[IT]] organizations that are planning and estimating projects or in risk management." He pointed out that there are available techniques, such as the [[Monte Carlo analysis]], to study probability, but too often "the continuum of probability is ignored."&lt;ref name="Cagley"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cagley|first1=Tom|title=Cognitive Bias|url=https://tcagley.wordpress.com/2013/07/08/cognitive-bias-daily-process-thoughts-july-8-2013/|website=TCagley|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Rolf Dobelli]] presented a choice between two [[games of chance]]. In one, you have a one in 100 million chance of winning $10 million; in the other, you have a one in 10,000 chance of winning $10,000. It is more reasonable to choose the second game; but most people would choose the first. For this reason, jackpots in lotteries are growing.&lt;ref name="Meaning Ring"/&gt;

Dobelli has described the U.S. Food Act of 1958 as a "classic example" of neglect of probability. The law – which prohibited [[carcinogenic]] substances in food, no matter how low the probability that they would in fact result in [[cancer]] – led to the substitution of those substances by ingredients that, while not causing cancer, stood a far greater chance of causing some sort of medical harm.&lt;ref name="Meaning Ring"/&gt;

In 2001, there was widespread panic around the U.S. over [[shark attacks]], even though there was no evidence to show any increase in their occurrence. Legislation was actually enacted to address the issue.&lt;ref name="Sunstein"/&gt; Neglect of probability also figures in the purchase of [[lottery ticket]]s.&lt;ref name="Cagley"/&gt; Cass Sunstein has pointed out that terrorism is effective partly because of probability neglect.&lt;ref name="Sunstein"/&gt; "Terrorists show a working knowledge of probability neglect," he wrote in 2003, "producing public fear that might greatly exceed the discounted harm."&lt;ref name="Journal of Risk and Uncertainty"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sunstein|first1=Cass|title=Terrorism and Probability Neglect|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|date=March 2003|volume=26|issue=2|pages=121–136|doi=10.1023/A:1024111006336|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
The probability bias is especially pronounced among children. In a 1993 study, Baron, Granato, Spranca, and Teubal presented children with the following situation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Susan and Jennifer are arguing about whether they should wear seat belts when they ride in a car. Susan says that you should. Jennifer says you shouldn't... Jennifer says that she heard of an accident where a car fell into a lake and a woman was kept from getting out in time because of wearing her seat belt, and another accident where a seat belt kept someone from getting out of the car in time when there was a fire. What do you think about this?''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Jonathan Baron]] (2000) notes that subject X responded in the following manner:
:A: Well, in that case I don't think you should wear a seat belt.
:Q (interviewer): How do you know when that's gonna happen?
:A: Like, just hope it doesn't!
:Q: So, should you or shouldn't you wear seat belts?
:A: Well, tell-you-the-truth we should wear seat belts.
:Q: How come?
:A: Just in case of an accident. You won't get hurt as much as you will if you didn't wear a seat belt.
:Q: OK, well what about these kinds of things, when people get trapped?
:A: I don't think you should, in that case.

It is clear that subject X completely disregards the probability of an accident happening versus the probability of getting hurt by the seat belt in making the decision. A normative model for this decision would advise the use of [[Expected utility hypothesis|expected-utility]] theory to decide which option would likely maximize utility. This would involve weighing the changes in utility in each option by the probability that each option will occur, something that subject X ignores.

Another subject responded to the same question:
:A: If you have a long trip, you wear seat belts half way.
:Q: Which is more likely?
:A: That you'll go flyin' through the windshield.
:Q: Doesn't that mean you should wear them all the time?
:A: No, it doesn't mean that.
:Q: How do you know if you're gonna have one kind of accident or the other?
:A: You don't know. You just hope and pray that you don't.

Again, the subject disregards the probability in making the decision by treating each possible outcome as equal in his reasoning.

==Practical consequences==
David Minger has called neglect of probability "a problematic bias because it skews reality and throws rational judgment off."&lt;ref name="Minger"/&gt; It results in poor decision making: "We invest in start-ups because the potential profit makes dollar signs flash before our eyes, but we forget (or are too lazy) to investigate the slim chances of new businesses actually achieving such growth. Similarly, following extensive media coverage of a plane crash, we cancel flights without really considering the minuscule probability of crashing (which, of course, remains the same before and after such a disaster)."&lt;ref name="Meaning Ring"/&gt; Cass Sunstein has noted that for a long time after [[9/11]], many people refused to fly because they felt a heightened sense of fear or peril, even though, statistically, most of them "were not at significantly more risk after the attacks than they were before." Indeed, those who chose to drive long distances instead of flying thereby put themselves at an increased risk, given that driving is the less safe form of transportation.&lt;ref name="Sunstein"/&gt;

==Legal ramifications==
In a 2001 paper, Sunstein addressed the question of how the law should respond to the neglect of probability. He emphasized that it is important for government to "create institutions designed to ensure that genuine risks, rather than tiny ones, receive the most concern". While government policies in regard to potential dangers should focus on statistics and probabilities, government efforts to raise public awareness of these dangers should emphasize worst-case scenarios in order to be maximally effective. Moreover, while it seems advisable for government to "attempt to educate and inform people, rather than capitulating to unwarranted public fear", that fear will remain a real phenomenon and may thus cause serious problems, for example leading citizens to undertake "wasteful and excessive private precautions". In such cases, certain  kinds of government regulation may be justified not because they address serious dangers but because they reduce fear. At the same time, government should "treat its citizens with respect" and "not treat them as objects to be channeled in government's preferred directions", so focusing on worst-case scenarios that feed on irrational fears would amount to "unacceptable manipulation".&lt;ref name="Sunstein"/&gt; In a 2003 article, however, Sunstein concluded that "As a normative matter, government should reduce even unjustified fear, if the benefits of the response can be shown to outweigh the costs."&lt;ref name="Journal of Risk and Uncertainty"/&gt;

== Buddhism ==
''Nidana'' doctrines of [[Buddhism]] are attributed to [[Shakyamuni]] Buddha.{{cn|date=May 2016}} It has two specific meanings. The more common use refers to the [[Twelve nidanas]] or ''"a concatenation of cause and effect"'', which is the cycle of rebirth as described by [[Gautama]] upon which a re-becoming is thought by [[Buddhist]]s to rest, which is also called the twelve links of '[[Dependent Origination|dependent origination]]'.&lt;ref name=peterharvey12links/&gt;

The term is also less commonly used with reference to the [[jhana]]s or stages of [[Buddhist]] meditation. The [[Twelve nidanas]] of [[samsara]] describe the stages of successive [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirths]], based upon ignorance, while the nidana of the jhanas, by contrast, arises from spiritual practice.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

An important example of ''nidanas'' in Buddhism, is the ''[[Twelve Nidānas]]'' doctrine where each link is asserted as a primary causal relationship between the connected links.&lt;ref name=peterharvey12links&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|editor=Steven M. Emmanuel|title=A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_lmCgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-119-14466-3|pages=50–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E.

== Hinduism ==
The term ''Nidana'' appears in numerous ancient and medieval Hindu texts wherein it means "first cause, primary cause, original or essential cause".&lt;ref name=mmwp486/&gt; This includes the [[Upanishads]] that include theosophical speculations,&lt;ref name=mmwp486/&gt; as well as medical texts such as [[Sushruta Samhita]] and [[Charaka Samhita]] where a large sub-book is titled ''Nidana-sthana'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Malavika Kapur |title=Psychological Perspectives on Childcare in Indian Indigenous Health Systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_7r-CQAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-81-322-2428-0 |pages=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in chapters of the [[Puranas]], wherein these discuss cause of disease or various natural phenomena.&lt;ref name=mmwp486/&gt;

{{For|paternal care in humans|Father}}

In [[biology]], '''paternal care''' is [[parental investment]] provided by a [[male]] or [[female]] animal to their own [[offspring]]. Paternal care may provided in concert with the mother (biparental care) or, more rarely, by the male alone (so called exclusive paternal care).

The provision of care, by either males or females, is presumed to increase growth rates, quality, and/or survival of young, and hence ultimately increase the [[inclusive fitness]] of parents.&lt;ref&gt;Lack, L. 1968.

== Mammals ==

Male mammals may invest heavily in reproduction through efforts to enhance [[reproductive success]] (e.g., [[courtship]] displays, [[Mate choice|intrasexual combat]]) or to provide paternal care. However, the costs of paternal care have rarely been studied in mammals, in large part because only 5-10% of mammals exhibit such care.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiman DG, Malcolm JR. 1981.

For example, mammalian [[fathers]] that care for their young may undergo systematic changes in [[body mass]] and in circulating or excreted concentrations of a number of [[hormones]] (e.g., [[androgens]], [[glucocorticoids]], [[leptin]]) as a function of reproductive status,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = JC | last2 = Laugero | first2 = KD | last3 = Van Westerhuyzen | first3 = JA | last4 = Hostetler | first4 = CM | last5 = Cohen | first5 = JD | last6 = Bales | first6 = KL | year = 2009 | title = Costs of pair-bonding and paternal care in male prairie voles (''Microtus ochrogaster'') | url = | journal = Physiol Behav | volume = 98 | issue = | pages = 367–373 | doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2009.06.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wynne-Edwards"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wynne-Edwards | first1 = KE | last2 = Timonin | first2 = ME | year = 2007 | title = Paternal care in rodents: weakening support for hormonal regulation of the transition to behavioral fatherhood in rodent animal models of biparental care | doi = 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2007.03.018 | journal = Horm Behav | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 114–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ziegler | first1 = TE | last2 = Prudom | first2 = SL | last3 = Schultz-Darken | first3 = NJ | last4 = Kurian | first4 = AV | last5 = Snowdon | first5 = CT | year = 2006 | title = Pregnancy weight gain: marmoset and tamarin dads show it too | url = | journal = Biol Lett | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 181–183 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0426| pmc = 1483903 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and several of these hormones have important effects on [[body composition]], [[metabolism]], and [[organismal performance]].&lt;ref name='Arnold1983'&gt;{{cite journal  |last=Arnold |first=S.

In [[mammals]], paternal care is found most commonly in [[primates]], [[rodents]] and [[canids]].

=== Humans ===
{{Main article|Father}}
Human [[cultures]] and [[societies]] vary widely in the expression of paternal care.  Some cultures recognize paternal care via celebration of [[Father's Day]].  According to CARTA [http://carta.anthropogeny.org/moca/topics/paternal-care|CARTA], human paternal care is a derived characteristic (evolved in humans or our recent ancestors) and one of the defining characteristics of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Different aspects of human paternal care (direct, indirect, fostering social or moral development) may have evolved at different points in our history, and together they form a unique suite of behaviors as compared with the [[great ape]]s.
One study of humans has found evidence suggesting a possible evolutionary trade-off between mating success and parenting involvement; specifically, [[fathers]] with smaller [[testes]] tend to be more involved in care of their [[children]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/better-fathers-have-smaller-testicles-1.13701|title=Better fathers have smaller testicles|first=Sarah|last=Zhang|publisher=|doi=10.1038/nature.2013.13701|journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on the effects of paternal care on human happiness have yielded conflicting results.  However, one recent study concluded that fathers generally report higher levels of happiness, positive emotion, and meaning in life as compared with non-fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = S.

According to the United States Census Bureau, approximately one third of children in the U.S. grow up without their biological father in their home.  Numerous studies have documented negative consequences of being raised in a home that lacks a father, including increased likelihood of living in poverty, having behavioral problems, committing crimes, spending time in prison, abusing drugs or alcohol, becoming obese, and dropping out of school.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.fatherhood.org/bid/190202/The-Father-Absence-Crisis-in-America-Infographic Accessed 17 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:California mouse 5 Peromyscus californicus.jpg|thumb|right|California mice (''[[Peromyscus californicus]]'') are well known for have intensive and sustained paternal behavior.]]

Several species of rodents have been studied as models of paternal care, including [[prairie vole]]s (''Microtus ochrogaster''), [[Campbell's dwarf hamster]], the [[Mongolian gerbil]], and the [[Rhabdomys|African striped mouse]].  The [[California mouse]] (''Peromyscus californicus'') is a [[Monogamy|monogamous]] rodent that exhibits extensive and essential paternal care, and hence has been studied as a [[model organism]] for this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Trainor, B.

== Birds ==
{{main article|Parental care in birds}}
Fathers contribute equally with mothers to the care of offspring in as many as 90% of [[bird]] species, sometimes including [[Egg incubation#Avian incubation|incubating]] the [[egg (biology)|eggs]].  Most paternal care is associated with biparental care in socially monogamous mating systems (about 81% of species), but in approximately 1% of species, fathers provide all care after eggs are laid.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  The unusually high incidence of paternal care in birds compared to other vertebrate taxa is often assumed to stem from the extensive resource requirements for production of flight-capable offspring.  By contrast, in bats (the other extant flying vertebrate lineage), care of offspring is provided by females (although males may help guard pups in some species&lt;ref&gt;Kunz, T.H. &amp; W.R. Hood. 2000.  Parental care and postnatal growth in the Chiroptera.  pp 416-510 in Reproductive Biology of Bats; E. G. Chrichton, &amp; P. H. Krutzsch, Eds.  Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;). In contrast to the large clutch sizes found in many bird species with biparental care, bats typically produce single offspring, which may be a limitation related to lack of male help. It has been suggested, though not without controversy, that paternal care is the ancestral form of parental care in birds.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Amphibians ==
Paternal care occurs in a number of species of anuran amphibians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = J. L. | last2 = Morales | first2 = V. | last3 = Summers | first3 = K. | year = 2010 | title = A key ecological trait drove the evolution of biparental care and monogamy in an amphibian | url = | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 175 | issue = | pages = 436–446 | doi=10.1086/650727 | pmid=20180700}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[glass frogs]].

== Fish ==
{{expand section|date=March 2014}}
Paternal care occurs in perhaps as many as half of the known species of certain families of [[teleost]] [[fish]].  One well-known example of paternal care is in [[seahorses]], where males [[Egg incubation|brood]] the eggs in a brood pouch until they are ready to hatch. 

Males from the [[Centrarchidae]] (sunfish) family exhibit paternal parental care of their eggs and fry through a variety of behaviors such as nest guarding and nest fanning (aerating eggs)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BLUMER|first=LAWRENCE S.|date=1982-05-01|title=A bibliography and categorization of bony fishes exhibiting parental care|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1096-3642.1982.tb01939.x|journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society|language=en|volume=75|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1982.tb01939.x|issn=0024-4082}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In [[jawfish]], the female lays the eggs and the male then takes them in his mouth. A male can have up to 400 eggs in his mouth at one time. The male can't feed while he hosts the young, but as the young get older, they spend more time out of the mouth.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/16251726|author=Taylor, A-L.|title=Shells, trees and bottoms: Strange places fish live|year=2012|publisher=BBC|accessdate=February 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes termed [[ mouthbrooding]].

During the breeding season, male [[three-spined stickleback]]s defend nesting territories. Males attract females to spawn in their nests and defend their breeding territory from intruders and predators. After spawning, the female leaves the male's territory and the male is solely responsible for the care of the eggs. During the ~6-day incubation period, the male 'fans' (oxygenates) the eggs, removes rotten eggs and debris, and defends the territory. Even after embryos hatch, father sticklebacks continue to tend their  newly hatched offspring for ~7 days, chasing and retrieving fry that stray from the nest and spitting them back into the nest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wootton|first1=Robert|title=A Functional Biology of Sticklebacks|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical models of the evolution of paternal care ==

Mathematical models related to the [[prisoner's dilemma]] suggest that when female reproductive costs are higher than male reproductive costs, males cooperate with females even when they do not reciprocate. In this view, paternal care is an evolutionary achievement that compensates for the higher energy demands that reproduction typically involves for mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Salgado, M. 2013. The Evolution of Paternal Care. Pages 1-10 in A.M. Greenberg, W.G. Kennedy, and N.D. Bos (Eds.): SBP 2013, LNCS 7812. Springer-Verlag: Berlin, Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other models suggest that basic life-history differences between males and females are adequate to explain the evolutionary origins of maternal, paternal, and bi-parental care. Specifically, paternal care is more likely if male adult mortality is high, and maternal care is more likely to evolve if female adult mortality is high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Klug | first1 = H. | last2 = Bonsall | first2 = M. B. | last3 = Alonzo | first3 = S.

== Consequences for offspring survival and development ==

Care by fathers can have important consequences for [[Life|survival]] and [[Human development (biology)|development]] of offspring in both humans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zerotothree.org/child-development/early-development/how-men-and-children-affect.html|title=How Men and Children Affect Each Other's Development|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other species. Mechanisms underlying such effects may include protecting offspring from predators or environmental extremes (e.g., heat or cold), feeding them or, in some species, direct teaching of skills.  Moreover, some studies indicate a potential epigenetic germline inheritance of
paternal effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Curley | first1 = J. P. | last2 = Mashoodh | first2 = R. | last3 = Champagne | first3 = F. A. | year = 2011 | title = Epigenetics and the origins of paternal effects | url = | journal = Hormones and Behavior | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 306–314 | doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2010.06.018| pmc = 2975825 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of paternal care on offspring can be studied in various ways. One way is to compare species that vary in the degree of paternal care. For example, an extended duration of paternal care occurs in the [[gentoo penguin]], as compared with other ''Pygoscelis'' species. It was found that their fledging period, the time between a chick's first trip to sea and its absolute independence from the group, was longer than other penguins of the same genus. The authors hypothesized that this was because it allowed chicks to better develop their foraging skills before becoming completely independent from their parents. By doing so, a chick may have a higher chance of survival and increase the population's overall fitness.&lt;ref&gt;Polito, Michael J., and Wayne Z. Trivelpiece. "Transition to Independence and Evidence of Extended Parental Care in the Gentoo Penguin (Pygoscelis Papua)." Marine Biology (2008): n. pag. WorldCat@OSU. Web. Sept. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proximate mechanisms ==

The [[Tinbergen's four questions#Proximate explanations|proximate mechanisms]] of paternal care are not well understood for any [[organism]].  In vertebrates, at the level of [[hormonal]] control, [[vasopressin]] apparently underlies the neurochemical basis of paternal care; [[prolactin]] and [[testosterone]] may also be involved.  As with other behaviors that affect [[Darwinian fitness]], [[Reward system|reward pathways]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/addiction/reward/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629033932/http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/addiction/reward/ |archivedate=2013-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[brain]] may reinforce the expression of paternal care and may be involved in the formation of [[Attachment theory|attachment bonds]].

The mechanisms that underlie the onset of parental behaviors in female mammals have been characterized in a variety of species. In mammals, females undergo endocrine changes during gestation and lactation that "prime" [[mothers]] to respond maternally towards their offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brunton | first1 = P. | last2 = Russell | first2 = J. | last3 = Douglas | first3 = A. | year = 2008 | title = Adaptive responses of the maternal hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal axis during pregnancy and lactation | url = | journal = Journal of Neuroendocrinology | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 764–776 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2826.2008.01735.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Numan, M., &amp; Insel, T. R. 2003. The Neurobiology of Parental Behavior. Springer, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paternal males do not undergo these same hormonal changes and so the proximate causes of the onset of parental behaviors must differ from those in females. There is little consensus regarding the processes by which mammalian males begin to express parental behaviors.&lt;ref name="Wynne-Edwards" /&gt;  In humans, evidence ties [[oxytocin]] to sensitive care-giving in both women and men, and with [[affectionate]] infant contact in women and [[Stimulate|stimulatory]] [[infant]] contact in men.  In contrast, testosterone decreases in men who become involved fathers and testosterone may interfere with aspects of paternal care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rilling | first1 = K.

'''Paternity fraud''', also known as '''misattributed paternity'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2598159 | pmid=17664309 | doi=10.1136/jme.2005.013268 | volume=33 | title=Paternity fraud and compensation for misattributed paternity | date=August 2007 | journal=J Med Ethics | pages=475–80| last1 = Draper | first1 = H}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''paternal discrepancy''',&lt;ref name = "tel1"/&gt; is when a man is incorrectly identified to be the biological [[father]] of a child. The underlying assumption of paternity fraud is that the mother deliberately misidentified the biological father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=B|first=Jacobs, Melanie|date=2004|title=When Daddy Doesn't Want to Be Daddy Anymore: An Argument Against Paternity Fraud Claims|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/yjlf/vol16/iss2/3/|journal=Yale Journal of Law &amp; Feminism|language=en|volume=16|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paternity fraud is related to the historical understanding of [[adultery]].

==Occurrence==
Research published in 2016 indicated that one in 50 British fathers is unknowingly raising a child who is the biological child of another man, and that misattributed paternity is rarer than commonly believed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/fatherhood/one-in-50-british-fathers-unknowingly-raise-another-mans-child/ One in 50 British fathers unknowingly raises another man's child] Published by The Telegraph, April 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 scientific review of international published studies of paternal discrepancy found a range in incidence, around the world, from 0.8% to 30% (median 3.7%).&lt;ref name="pmid16100312"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bellis MA, Hughes K, Hughes S, Ashton JR |title=Measuring paternal discrepancy and its public health consequences |journal=J Epidemiol Community Health |volume=59 |issue=9 |pages=749–54 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16100312 |pmc=1733152 |doi=10.1136/jech.2005.036517 |url=http://jech.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16100312}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as many of the studies were conducted between the 1950s and the 1980s, numbers may be unreliable due to the inaccuracies of genetic testing methods and procedures used at the time. Studies ranging in date from 1991 to 1999, quote the following incidence rates: 4.0% (Canada), 2.8% (France), 1.4% and 1.6% (UK), and 11.8% (Mexico), 0.8% (Switzerland).&lt;ref name="pmid16100312"/&gt; These numbers suggest that the widely quoted and unsubstantiated figure of 10% of non-paternal events is an overestimate. However, in studies that solely looked at couples who obtained paternity testing because paternity was being disputed, there are higher levels; an incidence of 17% to 33% (median of 26.9%). Most at risk were those born to younger parents, to unmarried couples and those of lower socio-economic status, or from certain cultural groups.&lt;ref name="Wintour"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/01/freedomofinformation.childprotection | location=United Kingdom | work=The Guardian | first=Patrick | last=Wintour | title=One in 500 fathers wrongly identified by mothers in Child Support Agency claims | date=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 study in the [[United Kingdom]] found that biological fathers were misidentified in 0.2% (1 in 500) of the cases processed by the Child Support Agency. Of that 0.2%, those resolved with [[DNA paternity testing]] between 2004 and 2008 showed that between 10 and 19% of mothers had misidentified the biological father; data about why mothers identified the wrong biological father was not available.&lt;ref name="Wintour"/&gt;

===Australia===

The Victorian County Court in 2002 awarded Mr. Magill $70,000 compensation for damages and economic loss against his ex-wife as a result of DNA testing in 2000 that showed only one of three children he was paying support for were genetically his.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/11/09/1162661797800.html | work=The Age | location=Australia | title=Paternity fraud 'dad' loses appeal | date=9 November 2006 | first=News | last=Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt;
That ruling was later overturned in 2005 by the Victorian Court of Appeal finding that "intent to deceive" by the ex-wife had not been proven regarding misrepresentations made by Ms. Magill in birth forms about the children's paternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Appeal-blow-for-man-who-paid-maintenance-for-anothers-children/2005/03/17/1110913737586.html | work=The Age | location=Australia | title=Appeal blow for man who paid maintenance for another's children | date=18 March 2005 | first=Peter | last=Gregory }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This ruling was in turn then appealed with the High Court of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/NATIONAL/Dad-loses-child-support-case/2006/10/31/1162056981681.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | location=Australia | title=Dad loses child support case | date=31 October 2006 |agency=Australian Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Australia's High Court struck down the appeal, upholding the 2005 Victorian Court of Appeal ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2006/51.html | work=Aust LII | location=AUS | title=Magill v Magill | date=9 November 2006 | first=High Court of | last=Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chief Justice Murray Gleeson in the 94 page High Court Ruling opined, "Without doubt the appellant's wife deceived him but the hurtful deception was in her infidelity, not in her failure to admit it."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/opinion/where-are-honesty-and-justice/story-e6frezz0-1111112502345 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=Australia | title=Where are honesty and justice? | date=11 November 2006 | first=Larissa | last=Cummings }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mr. Magill as part of the ruling was also ordered to pay the Child Support Agency's legal fees during the previous 18 months of litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/cgi-bin/common/printfriendly.pl?http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200611/s1784552.htm | work=ABC News | location=Australia | title=High Court rejects father's deceit claim | date=11 November 2006 | first=Australian | last=Broadcasting Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 High Court Ruling led to many calls from within Australia for reforms and changes to the Family Law Act and the Child Support Act to help protect men in Mr Magill's situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.news.com.au/top-stories/dna-test-rights-proposed-for-duped-dads/story-e6frfkp9-1111112528746 | work=The Australian  | location=Australia | title=DNA test rights proposed for duped dads | date=16 November 2006 | first=Australian | last=News }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 2008 putative fathers in Australia could begin using DNA testing to confirm paternity regarding support orders after new changes, "section 143 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act", took effect regarding Family Court policies. The Magill case is often cited regarding new law reforms in Australia and is considered a landmark type case.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/parents-war-on-dna/story-e6freuy9-1111117999005 | work=The Telegraph | location=Australia | title=Paternity tests prove hundreds of men duped | date=11 November 2008 | first=Kelvin | last=Bissett }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

Mr. Cornelio began paying child support for his ex-wife's twins after the couple separated in 1998. The former couple settled upon a joint custody agreement in 2002 that continued Mr. Cornelio's monetary child support for the twins.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/man-who-didnt-father-twins-must-pay-child-support/article1146243/ | work=The Globe and Mail | location=Canada | title=Man who didn't father twins must pay child support | date=9 April 2009 | first=Kirk | last=Makin }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Shortly afterwards Ms. Cornelio requested a reduction in visitation time along with an increase in support payments. Mr. Cornelio became suspicious of the paternity of the twins. A subsequent DNA test revealed that he was not their biological father. A request was made by Mr. Cornelio to be excused from paying further child support, claiming to be the victim of misrepresentation or fraud when Ms. Cornelio failed to disclose the extramarital affair when he signed the 2002 joint custody agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/563571--man-must-pay-support-though-twins-not-his | work=The Toronto Star | location=Canada | title=Man must pay support though twins not his | date=8 January 2009 | first=Precious | last=Yutangco }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ontario Superior Court of Justice in 2008 ruled against the request to be excused or reimbursed for child support payments. Judge van Rensburg, in deciding to deny the request, noted that Mr. Cornelio had wondered at the time of his separation if an affair by his ex-wife had actually been responsible for the twins. "It was not until access was interrupted and Ms. Cornelio commenced proceedings seeking increased child support that the respondent began pursuing this issue," the judge remarked. "The fact of that relationship – even if it has now become strained – is sufficient to require Mr. Cornelio to continue to contribute toward the children's material needs."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2008/2008canlii68884/2008canlii68884.html | work= | location=Ontario, Canada | title=Cornelio v. Cornelio, 2008 CanLII 68884 (ON SC) | date=22 December 2008 | first=Superior Court of Justice | last=Ontario }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===

The default in Finnish law as of 2018 is that the husband is the acknowledged father of the child who is born into wedlock (or to a deceased husband). Only if the wife agrees, can that initial determination be set to something else. However, from 2016 the general right the mother to solely allow or prevent the parental investigation was abolished. The default and immediately forcing juridical assumption of paternity of a husband was not changed in the latest 2015 act.

A man can bring up a later legal action to annul his paternity, disregarding of the resistance of his wife. The legal action for annulment may be brought in the district court by a man whose paternity has been determined on the basis of either marriage or by some other authoratitive decision.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lansivayla.fi/artikkeli/319235-isyyslaki-mullistuu-tunnukseen-helpotus-sylkinaytekoe-ja-peruutusmahdollisuus Isyyslaki mullistuu: Tunnukseen helpotus, sylkinäytekoe ja peruutusmahdollisuus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finland Paternity Act 2015, section 41&lt;/ref&gt;

A man who has officially acknowledged paternity relinquishes his rights to further actions if he, knowing the woman had a sexual intercourse with another man, or that she has used foreign sperm for fertilization, has stated in writing following birth of the child that the child is biologically his.&lt;ref&gt;Finland Paternity Act 2015, section 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Otherwise legally binding prebirth acknowledgment of a man must be rejected, if either the health care staff of the child supervisor do have a founded suspicion that the man is not a father of the child, or he is for any reason not capable to understand what he is doing when acknowledging the paternity.&lt;ref&gt;Finland Paternity Act 2015, section 16&lt;/ref&gt;

If a mother deliberately gives false information to the authorities, which contributes to the erroneous establishment of paternity, she may be fined.&lt;ref&gt;Finland Paternity Act 2015, section 57&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===

In 2004, a [[South Korea]]n man was awarded $42,380 compensation for [[pain and suffering]] when a [[DNA test]] established that his ex-wife's paternity claim regarding their child was misattributed. When Mr. Doe, who had married Ms. Doe based on her paternity claim, began a lawsuit against a hospital for switching his child at birth, Ms. Doe claimed to having been pregnant with another man's baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-620927.html | work=CBS News | location=South Korea | title=Woman Ordered To Pay For Having Another Man's Baby | date=11 February 2009 | first=Brian | last=Bernbaum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
On 5 January 2015, the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]] (decision 5A_619 of 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.swissblawg.ch/2015/02/5a6192014-berechnung-der-einjahrigen.html |title=5A_619/2014: Berechnung der einjährigen Frist zur Anfechtung der Vaterschaftsanerkennung |trans-title=Calculation of the one-year period for contesting paternity recognition |first=Sabine |last=Herzog |work=swissblawg.ch |date=9 February 2015 |accessdate=23 March 2015 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;) decided on a case wherein a plaintiff challenged the paternity of his (alleged) daughter. The plaintiff had his sperm examined in November 2009. As a result of the examination, the plaintiff’s fertility was found to be 3%. The court contended that the alleged father should have started investigating his paternity as a consequence of that finding. The plaintiff actually had his non-paternity confirmed via DNA evidence in 2013 upon failure of his marriage. The court held that the one year time limit under [[Swiss civil code]] article 260c for filing an action lapsed due to the plaintiff’s (the alleged father’s) inactivity for more than two years. The [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]] thus confirmed the ruling by the first instance and dismissed the appeal. It follows that the plaintiff’s financial obligations as to his (alleged) daughter will not change.

===United Kingdom===

In the [[United Kingdom]], paternity fraud, like adultery, is not a criminal offence&lt;ref name = "tel1"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/relationships/fatherhood/11839479/Should-we-be-doing-more-to-expose-paternity-fraud.html Should we be doing more to expose paternity fraud?] Published in The Telegraph, 4 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; except in the case of the lineage of the children of the British monarch under the [[Treason Act 1351]] where the adulterers are punishable as adultering against the lineage of the King with the King's "companion, ... or the wife of the King's eldest son and heir". Knowingly making a false statement on a public document is a criminal offence, including naming someone who is not the biological father. As of 2008, no individual has been prosecuted in a case involving paternity fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/01/freedomofinformation.childprotection DNA testing: One in 500 fathers wrongly identified by mothers in Child Support Agency claims] Published in [[The Guardian]], 1st August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A mother is permitted to not state the name of the biological father if she does not know it.&lt;ref name="Draper"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Draper |first=Heather |year=2005 |title=Paternity fraud and compensation for misattributed paternity |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=33 |issue=8 |pages=475–480 |doi=10.1136/jme.2005.013268 |pmid=17664309 |pmc=2598159}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paternity fraud is a form of [[Non-paternity event|misattributed paternity]].&lt;ref name="Draper"/&gt;

The split in 2002 between a couple, identified for legal reasons as Mr. A and Ms. B, prompted Mr. A to pursue a parental contract to establish his non-married rights as their child's father.  Ms. B then requested a [[DNA test]] that later showed Mr. A was not the (then) five year old's father. Following the discovery Mr. A then sued Ms. B for damages of up to £100,000 as a result of the deceit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1547568/Lover-must-pay-broker-for-claiming-son-was-his.html | work=The Telegraph | location=London, United Kingdom | title=Lover must pay broker for claiming son was his | date=4 April 2007 | first=Amy | last=Iggulden }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2007 in what was reported as the first known case of its kind to reach trial in Britain, the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ruled in favor of {{not a typo|Mr. A}} awarding £7,500 distress damages with another £14,943 for holidays and meals out Mr. A spent on Ms. B (not the child). The judgment fell short of listed suit amount because the London court did not allow damages for the child's material costs incurred because of Mr. A's enjoyment of the relationship. The judge, [[John Blofeld (judge)|Sir John Blofeld]], said he was satisfied that Mr. A's motivation in coming to court was not as a lever for contact with the child but because he did not want "to be taken for a ride".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/apr/04/law.world | work=The Guardian | location=London, United Kingdom | title=Stockbroker wins £22,000 damages for paternity deceit | date=3 April 2007 | first=Karen  | last=McVeigh }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The United States has historically imposed a strong presumption of marital paternity, and has also imposed barriers to paternity challenges once paternity has been legally established. In more recent years, especially since the advent of DNA testing, laws and guidelines have been proposed or enacted that may allow for a paternity challenge by a legal father who later determines he is not a child's biological father, or by a biological father who learns that somebody else has been named on a child's birth certificate as the child's father.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1580398-1,00.html | work=Time Magazine | location=United States | title=Duped Dads Fight Back | date=19 January 2007 | first=Julie | last=Rawe }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2003/Dec-08-Mon-2003/news/22741969.html | work=Review-Journal | location=Las Vegas, Nevada | title=Movement targets `paternity fraud' | date=8 December 2003 | first=Richard | last=Lake }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====California====
In the case of ''County of Los Angeles v. Navarro'', in 1996, the County of Los Angeles entered a default judgment against putative father Mr. Navarro and ordered him to pay monthly support for Ms. Doe's two children.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16132321968914865606 | work=scholar.google | location=California, United States | title=County of Los Angeles v. Navarro | date=30 June 2004 | first=Court of | last=Appeal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The complaint to establish paternity filed by the Bureau of Family Support Operations was based on information provided by Ms. Doe naming "Manuel Nava" as the children's father. The agency determined that Mr. Navarro was the father in question and delivered notice to his sister's residence listing Mr. Navarro as "co-resident", a notice Mr. Navarro denied ever receiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,125579,00.html | work=Fox News | location=United States | title=Paternity: Innocence Is Now a Defense | date=14 July 2004 | first=Wendy | last=McElroy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Mr. Navarro, armed with a DNA test showing he was not the children's father, sued the County of Los Angeles asking to be relieved from the support order.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/jan/15/20050115-115942-7925r/?page=all | work=Washington Times | location=United States | title=Law aids paternity fraud victims | date=15 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The County of Los Angeles opposed the motion, arguing the motion was filed after the six month limit to contest a default judgment and the mother’s mere assertion that he was the father was insufficient to establish extrinsic fraud. The trial court sided with the County and denied the motion. This ruling was then appealed before the California 2nd Appellate Court of Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5156427484382718804 | work=Case Law [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/californiastatecases/b155166.pdf County of L.A. v.

In 2004 the court of appeal reversed the trial court decision ruling in favor of Mr. Navarro and became the first published California case to hold that the [[statute of limitations]] did not apply in setting aside an old default judgment against a paternity fraud victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/aug/18/20040818-111309-3555r/?page=all | work=Washington Times | location=United States | title=Court asked to ‘depublish’ child-support ruling | date=18 August 2004 | first=Staff | last=Writer }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Immediately after the ruling was issued, the Los Angeles County Child Support Services Department announced that it would request that the case be depublished so it could not be used as a precedent by other men in Mr. Navarro's situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/California+agency+will+seek+to+depublish+paternity+ruling.-a0125336142 | work=American Association for Justice | location=Trial Magazine | title=California agency will seek to depublish paternity ruling | date=1 November 2004 | first=Sileo | last=Carmel }}&lt;/ref&gt; That request was later denied by the [[California Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/jan/15/20050115-115942-7925r | work=The Washington Times | title=Law aids paternity fraud victims | date=15 January 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Florida====
In the case of ''Parker v. Parker'', as part of their 2001 Florida divorce settlement Mr. Parker was obliged to pay $1200 monthly child support based on Ms. Parker's representations to the court that Mr. Parker was the child's biological father. In 2003 Ms. Parker filed a motion for contempt and a petition to enforce child support against Mr. Parker which prompted a DNA test showing that Mr. Parker was not the child's biological father.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15319835621860114145&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,48 | work=scholar.google | location=Florida, United States | title=Parker v. Parker, 916 So. 2d 926 | date=30 November 2005 | first=Florida Court of Appeal | last=Fourth District. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The motion was 16 months after their divorce, Florida law (at that time) only allowed the husband 12 months to contest paternity following divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.sptimes.com/2007/02/02/State/Court_backs_deadline_.shtml | work=Tampa Bay Times | location=Florida, United States | title=Court backs deadline for challenging paternity | date=2 February 2007 |agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mr. Parker's court ordered payments would total about $216,000 over the next fifteen years.

Mr. Parker filed a petition for relief claiming that the misrepresentation of paternity had resulted in a fraudulent support order. This was dismissed by both the Trial and then, in 2005, the Court of Appeal as being intrinsic fraud and subject to the Florida one year time limit to contest a dissolution decree, not extrinsic fraud, or a fraud upon the court, that can form the basis for relief from judgment more than a year later. This ruling was then appealed before the Florida Supreme Court who, in 2007, denied Mr. Parker's suit upholding the Fourth District Court of Appeal 2005 ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2007/index.shtml | work=2007 Florida Supreme Court Decisions | location=[http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2007/sc05-2346.pdf Court Opinion] | title=SC05-2346 Parker v. Parker | date=1 February 2007 | first=Supreme Court of | last=Florida }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2006, the Florida statutes changed allowing a DNA test to be considered new evidence to contest a support order after the one year time limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.flsenate.gov/laws/statutes/2012/0742.18 | work=2012 Florida Statutes | location=Florida, United States | title=Florida Statutes, Title 43, Ch.742, Sec.18 | date=20 June 2006 | first=Florida | last=Senate }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In its published opinion the Supreme Court Ruling in 2007 noted the change in Florida Statutes, "which provides the circumstances and procedures under which a male may disestablish paternity and terminate a child support obligation," however the court decided not to consider the applicability of this new statute to Mr. Parker's circumstances, kicking the question of a retrial under the new law back to the Trial Courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0209/p01s01-usju.htm | work=Christian Science Monitor | location=Florida, United States | title=Dad wasn't dad after all, but still owes child support | date=9 February 2007 | first=Warren | last=Richey }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the basic facts are little questioned and the case explores differences between [[Extrinsic fraud|extrinsic]] and [[Intrinsic fraud|intrinsic]] fraud, other state Supreme Courts, including Iowa&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12677538385052883680&amp;q | work=scholar.google | location=Iowa S.C., United States | title=Dier v.

Hodge | date=1 October 2012 | first=Supreme Court of | last=Tennessee }}&lt;/ref&gt; have cited ''Parker v. Parker'' when writing opinions of their own for paternity fraud type cases.

====Iowa====
In 2012 the [[Iowa Supreme Court]] in ruling to allow a paternity fraud tort to proceed as they fall "within the traditional boundaries of fraud law", but advised caution in bringing cases, as they would be "hard to prove, emotional and embarrassing".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.thonline.com/news/iowa-illinois-wisconsin/article_d7e7f75a-97c0-5a35-9a38-ad1f698b74cc.html | work=Telegraph Herald | location=Dubuque, Iowa | title=Iowa court allows paternity-fraud lawsuit | date=2 June 2012 |agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Mexico====

In the case of ''Barreras v. Trevino'', Mr. Barreras and Ms. Trevino divorced in 1999 with Ms. Trevino shortly afterwards gaining a support order for her supposed daughter with Mr. Barreras named as the putative father. In 2004 a New Mexico court ruled that the child Mr. Barreras had (up until then) paid $20,000 support to Ms. Trevino for did not actually exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=2a2451e124 | work=KOB-TV Eyewitness News | location=New Mexico, USA | title=Where's the Baby? | date=6 December 2004 | first=Mark | last=Horner }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mr. Barreras sued a DNA testing laboratory in 2006 for falsifying two separate DNA tests for the supposed child by using samples taken from his adult daughter who, along with one of the lab employees, also face fraud charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://kob.com/article/stories/S190773.shtml | work=NBC News | location=United States | title=Child support fraud case lands in 2 courtrooms | date=10 September 2007 | first=Jeremy | last=Jojola }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ms. Trevino pleaded guilty in 2008 to charges of fraud and perjury, and was sentenced to twenty-one years in prison. Trevino served 16 months in federal prison in Arizona for claiming the non-existent girl on tax returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.clipsyndicate.com/publish/video/658732/trevino_pleads_guilty_to_fraud_perjury | work=Clips Syndicate | location=NBC News, USA | title=Trevino pleads guilty to fraud, perjury | date=1 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the paternity fraud Ms. Trevino was able to obtain a [[birth certificate]], [[Medicare (United States)|medicare card]] and [[Social Security (United States)|social security card]] for the fictitious girl prompting (then) [[Bill Richardson|Gov. Bill Richardson]] to direct New Mexico Department of Human Services to explain how several government agencies became not only unwitting partners in the fraud, but also resisted efforts to correct it.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,141525,00.html | work=Fox News | location=New Mexico, United States | title=Agency Culpable in Child Support Scam | date=17 December 2004 | first=Wendy | last=McElroy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Letters and calls from Mr. Barreras to the New Mexico child support agency about his vasectomy in 1998 were ignored and when the child support enforcement division's order to bring the supposed child in for more paternity tests were not complied with by Ms. Trevino the agency simply closed the case without further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.abqjournal.com/news/metro/272130metro12-12-04.htm | work=ABQ Journal | location=Albuquerque, New Mexico | title=Ex-husband Paid $20,000 To Support Nonexistent Daughter | date=12 December 2004 | first=Carolyn | last=Carlson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tennessee====

In the case of ''Hodge v. Craig'' in October 2012, intentional misrepresentation of paternity was recognized by a unanimous Tennessee Supreme Court in ''Hodge v. Craig'', a case where the mother intentionally lied to a man about who the father of the child was. Based on the mother's assurances the couple married but later divorced. The plaintiff dutifully paid child support including medical insurance for the child. Based on physical differences between himself and the child he obtained a tissue sample and confirmed his suspicions. Damages were awarded in compensation for child support paid for 15 years.&lt;ref name=Justia101612&gt;{{cite news|title=When Your Daddy Is Not Really Your Daddy: A Man Successfully Sues His Ex-Wife for Paternity Fraud Damages|url=http://verdict.justia.com/2012/10/16/when-your-daddy-is-not-really-your-daddy|accessdate=16 October 2012|newspaper=Justia.Com|date=16 October 2012|author=Joanna L. Grossman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court's decision was based on the [[common law]] remedy of [[fraud|intentional misrepresentation]]; the court distinguished the award of damages from a retroactive modification of [[child support]]. The action was for damages; it was not a suit to disestablish paternity.&lt;ref name=TN100112&gt;{{cite web|title=Tina Marie Hodge v.

==Criticism==
The topic of paternity fraud is controversial. In the ''Journal of Medical Ethics'', Heather Draper writes, "claims for reimbursement and compensation in cases of misattributed paternity produce the same distorted and thin view of what it means to be a father that paternity testing assumes, and underscores a trend that is not in the interests of children."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lyn Turner says that the concept of paternity fraud is about the "demonization of mothers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turney|first=Lyn|date=2011-12-01|title=The Denial of Paternity: Pregnancy as a Risk to the ‘Pure Relationship’|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0038038511416151|journal=Sociology|language=en|volume=45|issue=6|pages=1110–1125|doi=10.1177/0038038511416151|issn=0038-0385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Qanun''' is an Arabic word ({{lang-ar|قانون}}, ''qānūn''; {{lang-ota|قانون}}, ''kānūn'', derived from {{lang-grc|κανών}} ''kanōn'', which is also the root for the modern English word "[[canon law|canon]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|kanw/n|κανών|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Between God and the Sultan: A History of Islamic Law|author=Knut S.

It is thus frequently translated as "dynastic law". The idea of ''kanun'' first entered the Muslim World in the thirteenth century, as it was borrowed from the [[Mongol Empire]] in the aftermath of their invasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burak |first=Guy |title=The Second Formation of Islamic Law: The Ḥanafī School in the Early Modern Ottoman Empire |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2015 |isbn=978-1-107-09027-9 |pages=17–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10th sultan of the Ottoman Empire, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman]] was known in the Ottoman Empire as Suleiman Kanuni ("the Lawgiver"), due to his code of laws. 

After the fall of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in 1258, a practice known to the [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Mongols]] transformed itself into qanun, which gave power to [[caliphate|caliphs]], [[governor]]s, and sultans alike to "make their own regulations for activities not addressed by the sharia."&lt;ref name = "Berg-TerrorLaw"&gt;Berg, Herbert. "Islamic Law." Berkshire Encyclopedia of World History 3 (2005): 1030. In History Reference Center[database online]. Available from Snowden Library . Retrieved February 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This became increasingly important as the Middle East started to modernize, thus running into the problems of a modern state, which were not covered by sharia. The Qanun began to unfold as early as Umar I (586–644 CE).&lt;ref name = "Berg-TerrorLaw"/&gt; Many of the regulations covered by qanun were based on financial matters or tax systems adapted through the law and regulations of those territories Islam conquered.&lt;ref name = "Berg-TerrorLaw"/&gt;

The term ḳānūn derives itself from the Greek word κανών. Originally having the less abstract meaning of “any straight rod” it then later referred to any “measure or rule” in Greek. The word was then translated into and adopted by the Arabic language after the Ottoman Empire’s conquest of Egypt under Sultan [[Selim I]] (ca. 1516). In the Ottoman empire, the term ḳānūn still carried the word’s original meanings of a system of tax regulation. However, it later came to also refer to “code of regulations” or “state law”, a well-defined secular distinction to “Muslim law” known as the s̲h̲arīʿa. The ḳānūn took on significant importance during the period of modernization in the Ottoman Empire. The ḳānūn and s̲h̲arīʿa did not contradict each other concerning administrative matters, and therefore the ḳānūn was assimilated easily into Ottoman regulatory functions. The ḳānūn promulgated by Ottoman sultans also came to be used for financial and penal law. Under Sultan Mehmed II (1451-1481) the ḳānūn continued to be strictly applied for these practices. However due to the influence of [[Ebussuud Efendi|Abu ʾl-Suʿūd]], [[Grand Mufti|grand muftī]] of Istanbul from 1545 to 1574 the ḳānūn was applied to deal with matters concerning property rights as well. Previously, property rights were exclusively under the jurisdiction of the s̲h̲arīʿa. Despite this seeming contradiction, due to skillful bureaucratic operations, the ḳānūn and the s̲h̲arīʿa existed harmoniously. The ḳānūn has retained its relevance in the Middle East regarding civil, commercial, administrative, and penal laws that were inspired by originally Western legislation. It also has an influence in the ways that provisions of the s̲h̲arīʿa are reproduced.&lt;ref&gt;Linant de Bellefonds, Y., Cahen, Cl., İnalcık, Halil, and Ed. “Ḳānūn”.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9902">'''Reflected appraisal''' is a term used in [[psychology]] to describe a person's perception of how others see and evaluate him or her. The reflected appraisal process concludes that people come to think of themselves in the way they believe others think of them (Mead, 1934; Cooley, 1902; Sullivan, 1947). This process has been deemed important to the development of a person's self-esteem, especially because it includes interaction with people outside oneself,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hindman|first1=Kaci|title=What Is Reflected Appraisal?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-reflected-appraisal.htm|website=wisegeek.com|publisher=Conjecture Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered one of the main influences on the development of self-concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1=Kendra | last1=Cherry | url=http://psychology.about.com/od/rindex/g/reflectapp.htm | title=What Is the Reflected Appraisal Process? | website=psychology.about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Harry Stack Sullivan]] first coined the term reflected appraisal in 1953 when he published ''The Interpersonal Theory of Psychiatry'', though [[Charles H. Cooley]] was the first to describe the process of reflected appraisal when he discussed his concept of the [[looking-glass self]] (1902). Although some of our self-views are gained by direct experience with our environment, most of what we know about ourselves is derived from others.

In 1979, Shrauger and Shoeneman found that rather than our [[self-concept]]s resembling the way others actually see us, our self-concepts are filtered through our perceptions and resemble how we think others see us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leary|first1=Mark R.|last2=Tangney|first2=June Price|title=Handbook of Self and Identity|date=July 13, 2005|publisher=The Guilford Press|isbn=1593852371|pages=5–6|edition=1|url=http://wat2146.ucr.edu/papers/02a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Felson (1993) explained that individuals are not very accurate in judging what others think of them. Among the causes of the discrepancy is the apprehension of others about revealing their views. At best, they may reveal primarily favorable views rather than both favorable and unfavorable views. Consistent with other research (DePaulo, Kenny, Hoover, Webb &amp; Oliver, 1987, Keny &amp; Albright, 1987), Felson found that individuals have a better idea of how groups see them than of how specific individuals see them. Presumably, individuals learn the group standards and then apply those standards. In turn, when group members judge individuals, they use the same standards that individuals originally applied to themselves. Thus we find a correspondence in self-appraisals and other’s appraisals of the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leary|first1=Mark R.|last2=Tangney|first2=June Price|title=Handbook of Self and Identity|date=July 13, 2005|publisher=The Guilford Press|isbn=1593852371|pages=5–6|edition=1|url=http://wat2146.ucr.edu/papers/02a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extent of impact ==
The extent to which reflected appraisals affect the person being appraised depends upon characteristics of the appraiser and his or her appraisal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rao|first1=Sree|title=How the Self concept Develops|url=http://www.citeman.com/9591-how-the-self-concept-develops.html|website=citeman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greater impact on the development of a person’s self-concept is said to occur when:
(1) the appraiser is perceived as a highly credible source
(2) the appraiser takes a very personal interest in the person being appraised 
(3) the appraisal is very discrepant with the person’s self-concept at the moment
(4) the number of confirmations of a given appraisal is high 
(5) the appraisals coming from a variety of sources are consistent and 
(6) appraisals are supportive of the person’s own beliefs about himself or herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rao|first1=Sree|title=How the Self concept Develops|url=http://www.citeman.com/9591-how-the-self-concept-develops.html|website=citeman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationships ==
Several studies have been conducted on the way reflected appraisal affects various relationships in a person's life. The idea that a person's self-concept is related to what that person perceives as another's opinion usually holds more weight with significant others. Appraisals from significant others such as parents, close friends, trusted colleagues, and other people the individual strongly admires, influences self-concept development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rao|first1=Sree|title=How the Self concept Develops|url=http://www.citeman.com/9591-how-the-self-concept-develops.html|website=citeman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often has more influence than a stranger on a child's developing self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hindman|first1=Kaci|title=What Is Reflected Appraisal?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-reflected-appraisal.htm|website=wisegeek.com|publisher=Conjecture Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Study of this topic has led to the realization that people sometimes tend to anticipate what will happen in the future based on a previous perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hindman|first1=Kaci|title=What Is Reflected Appraisal?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-reflected-appraisal.htm|website=wisegeek.com|publisher=Conjecture Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Families ===
Reflected appraisals are present among family members. All family members have opinions about one another and are typically less reticent to express them to each other than is the case outside of family relations. Siblings, especially, may be only too eager to give critical feedback regarding each other's behavior, appearance, social skills, and intelligence. Not all of these appraisals, of course, are equally significant for one's [[self-esteem]]. Both what is being appraised (with regard to its importance for one's self-concept) and who does the appraising, are important qualifiers. For children, on most things, the reflected appraisals of their parents may matter much more than those of their siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self-Esteem|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Self-Esteem.aspx|website=encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflected appraisal has been the main process examined in studies of self-esteem within families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self-Esteem|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Self-Esteem.aspx|website=encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of this research has focused on the effects of parental behavior on children's self-esteem. In general, these studies find that parental support and encouragement, responsiveness, and use of inductive control are related positively to children's self-esteem (Gecas and Seff 1990). Most of these parental variables could be considered indicators of positive reflected appraisals of the child. They are also the parental behaviors found to be associated with the development of other positive [[socialization]] outcomes in children and adolescents (such as moral development, pro-social behavior, and academic achievement).

In the investigation of the reflected appraisal process with newly married couples, [[social status]] derived from one’s position in the social structure also influences the appraisal process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leary|first1=Mark R.|last2=Tangney|first2=June Price|title=Handbook of Self and Identity|date=July 13, 2005|publisher=The Guilford Press|isbn=1593852371|pages=5–6|edition=1|url=http://wat2146.ucr.edu/papers/02a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spouse with the higher status (education, occupation, and income) in the marriage is more likely to not only influence their partner’s self-views, but also their partner’s views of them (Cast, Stets, &amp; Burke, 1999). Spouses with a lower status in the marriage have less influence on the self-view of their higher status counterparts or on how their higher-status counterparts view them.

== Scripts ==
Through reflected appraisals, we are also given lines to speak in everyday situations (Murial &amp; Joneward, 1971, pp.&amp;nbsp;68–100) that are sometimes so specific that some people refer to them as scripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hybels|first1=Saundra|last2=Weaver II|first2=Richard L.|title=Communicating Effectively|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies|isbn=0072563974|pages=36–37|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through these scripts, we are given our lines, our gestures, and our characterizations. The scripts tell us how to act in future scenarios, and what is expected of us. Others tell us what they expect from us, how we should look, how we should behave, and how we should say our lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hybels|first1=Saundra|last2=Weaver II|first2=Richard L.|title=Communicating Effectively|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies|isbn=0072563974|pages=36–37|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-fulfilling prophecies ==
The messages we receive about ourselves during the process of reflected appraisal can become [[self-fulfilling prophecies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hybels|first1=Saundra|last2=Weaver II|first2=Richard L.|title=Communicating Effectively|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies|isbn=0072563974|pages=36–37|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pygmalion effect]], [[Rosenthal effect]], and [[observer-expectancy effect]] show that biased expectancies could affect reality and create self-fulfilling prophecies through reflected appraisal. If you were given positive reflected appraisals when you were young, you probably have a good self-concept; if the appraisals were largely negative, your self-concept may suffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hybels|first1=Saundra|last2=Weaver II|first2=Richard L.|title=Communicating Effectively|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies|isbn=0072563974|pages=36–37|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saṃsāra''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|m|ˈ|s|ɑr|ə}}) is a [[Sanskrit]] word that means "wandering" or "world", with the connotation of cyclic, circuitous change.{{Sfn|Klaus Klostermaier|2010|p=604}}{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271-272}} It also refers to the concept of rebirth and "cyclicality of all life, matter, existence", a fundamental assumption of all [[Indian religions]], in short, it is the cycle of death and rebirth.{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271-272}}&lt;ref name="Gross1993p148"/&gt; ''Saṃsāra'' is sometimes referred to with terms or phrases such as transmigration, karmic cycle, [[reincarnation]], and "cycle of aimless drifting, wandering or mundane existence".{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271-272}}&lt;ref name="Firth1997p106"/&gt;

The concept of ''Saṃsāra'' has roots in the [[Vedas|Vedic literature]], but the theory is not discussed there. It appears in developed form, but without mechanistic details, in the early [[Upanishads]].&lt;ref name=amboyer/&gt;{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|pp=90-99}} The full exposition of the ''Saṃsāra'' doctrine is found in [[Sramana|Sramanic]] religions such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], as well as various schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] after about the mid-1st millennium BCE.{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|pp=90-99}}&lt;ref name="Krishan1997p17"/&gt; The ''Saṃsāra'' doctrine is tied to the [[Karma]] theory of Indian religions, and the liberation from ''Saṃsāra'' has been at the core of the spiritual quest of Indian traditions, as well as their internal disagreements.{{Sfn|Obeyesekere|2005|p=1-2, 108, 126-128}}{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=272-273}} The liberation from ''Saṃsāra'' is called [[Moksha]], [[Nirvana]], Mukti or Kaivalya.&lt;ref name="Firth1997p106"/&gt;{{Sfn|Michael Myers|2013|p=36}}{{Sfn|Harold Coward|2008|p=103}}

==Etymology and terminology==
''Saṃsāra'' ([[Sanskrit]]: संसार) means "wandering",{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271-272}}{{Sfn| Lochtefeld|2002|p=589}} as well as "world" wherein the term connotes "cyclic change".{{Sfn|Klaus Klostermaier|2010|p=604}} ''Saṃsāra'' is a fundamental concept in all [[Indian religions]], is linked to the [[karma]] theory, and refers to the belief that all living beings cyclically go through births and rebirths. The term is related to phrases such as "the cycle of successive existence", "transmigration", "karmic cycle", "the wheel of life", and "cyclicality of all life, matter, existence".{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271-272}}&lt;ref name="Gross1993p148"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rita M. Gross |title=Buddhism After Patriarchy: A Feminist History, Analysis, and Reconstruction of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PK37AxCfxVEC  |year=1993|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-0513-1 |pages=148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ykrishanp24/&gt; Many scholarly texts spell ''Saṃsāra'' as ''Samsara''.&lt;ref name="Gross1993p148"/&gt;{{Sfn|Jeaneane D. Fowler|1997|p=10}}

According to Monier-Williams, ''Saṃsāra'' is rooted in the term ''Saṃsṛ'' (संसृ), which means "to go round, revolve, pass through a succession of states, to go towards or obtain, moving in a circuit".&lt;ref name=monierwilliamssamsara&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1040|year=1923|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=1040–1041}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conceptual form from this root appears in ancient texts as ''Saṃsaraṇa'', which means "going around through a succession of states, birth, rebirth of living beings and the world", without obstruction.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamssamsara/&gt; The term shortens to ''Saṃsāra'', referring to the same concept, as a "passage through successive states of mundane existence", a transmigration, metempsychosis, a circuit of living where one repeats previous states, from one body to another, a worldly life of constant change, that is rebirth, growth, decay and redeath.&lt;ref name="Firth1997p106"/&gt;&lt;ref name=monierwilliamssamsara/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doniger1980p268"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger |title=Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4WZTj3M71y0C |year=1980|publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-03923-0|pages=268–269}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is then contrasted with the concept of [[moksha]], also known as ''mukti'', ''nirvana'', ''nibbana'' or ''kaivalya'', which refers to liberation from this cycle of aimless wandering.&lt;ref name="Firth1997p106"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shirley Firth |title=Dying, Death and Bereavement in a British Hindu Community |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYNXC-HK1u0C |year=1997|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=978-90-6831-976-7|pages=106, 29–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=monierwilliamssamsara/&gt;

The concept of Samsara developed in the [[Vedas|Vedic]] times, and is traceable in the [[Samhita]] layers such as in sections 1.164, 4.55, 6.70 and 10.14 of the [[Rigveda]].&lt;ref name="amboyer"/&gt;&lt;ref name=valleepoussin24&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis de La Vallée-Poussin | authorlink=Louis de La Vallée-Poussin|title=The way to Nirvana: six lectures on ancient Buddhism as a discipline of salvation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ito8AAAAIAAJ|year=1917|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=24–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krishan1997p11"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yuvraj Krishan |title=The Doctrine of Karma: Its Origin and Development in Brāhmaṇical, Buddhist, and Jaina Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bi6FWX1NOgC |year=1997|publisher= Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|isbn=978-81-208-1233-8 |pages=11–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the idea is mentioned in the [[Samhita]] layers of the Vedas, there is lack of clear exposition there, and the idea fully develops in the early [[Upanishads]].{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|p=90}}{{Sfn|Dalal|2010|p=344, 356-357}} Damien Keown states that the notion of "cyclic birth and death" appears around 800 BCE.{{Sfn|Damien Keown|2004|p=248}} The word ''Saṃsāra'' appears, along with [[Moksha]], in several [[Principal Upanishads]] such as in verse 1.3.7 of the [[Katha Upanishad]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/कठोपनिषदत्/प्रथमोध्यायः/तृतीयवल्ली Katha Upanishad प्रथमोध्यायः/तृतीयवल्ली] Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt; verse 6.16 of the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/श्वेताश्वतरोपनिषत्/षष्ठः_अध्यायः Shvetashvatara Upanishad षष्ठः अध्यायः] Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt; verses 1.4 and 6.34 of the [[Maitri Upanishad]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/मैत्रायण्युपनिषत् Maitri Upanishad] Wikisource, Quote: ३ चित्तमेव हि '''संसारम्''' तत्प्रयत्नेन शोधयेत्&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GA Jacob (1963), [https://archive.org/stream/UpanishadVakyaKosha-AConcordanceOfThePrincipalUpanishadsAndBhagavad/UpanishadVakyaKoshaSktEng#page/n953/mode/2up A concordance to the Principal Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita], Motilal Banarsidass, pages 947-948&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''Samsara'' is related to ''Saṃsṛti'', the latter referring to the "course of mundane existence, transmigration, flow, circuit or stream".&lt;ref name=monierwilliamssamsara/&gt;

==Definition and rationale==
The word literally means "wandering through, flowing on", states Stephen J. Laumakis, in the sense of "aimless and directionless wandering".{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|p=97}} The concept of ''Saṃsāra'' is closely associated with the belief that the person continues to be born and reborn in various realms and forms.&lt;ref name="GoaEtCoward2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/hinduism/|title=Hinduism|work=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=2015-07-31|archivedate=2014-02-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227223922/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/hinduism/|deadurl=no|date=2014-08-21|first1=David J.|last1=Goa|first2=Harold G.|last2=Coward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest layers of Vedic text incorporate the concept of life, followed by an afterlife in heaven and hell based on cumulative virtues (merit) or vices (demerit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Hastings|author2=John Alexander Selbie|author3=Louis Herbert Gray|title=Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UD8TAAAAYAAJ |year=1922|publisher=T. &amp; T. Clark|pages=616–618}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ancient Vedic [[Rishi]]s challenged this idea of afterlife as simplistic, because people do not live an equally moral or immoral life. Between generally virtuous lives, some are more virtuous; while evil too has degrees, and the texts assert that it would be unfair for god [[Yama]] to judge and reward people with varying degrees of virtue or vices, in "either or" and disproportionate manner.{{Sfn|Jessica Frazier|Gavin Flood|2011|pp=84-86}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kusum P. Merh |title=Yama, the Glorious Lord of the Other World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XSoKAQAAMAAJ |year=1996|publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-81-246-0066-5 |pages=213–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Anita Raina Thapan|title=The Penguin Swami Chinmyananda Reader |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iDiRLzPFOPIC |year=2006|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-400062-3 |pages=84–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They introduced the idea of an afterlife in heaven or hell in proportion to one's merit, and when this runs out, one returns and is reborn.{{Sfn|Jessica Frazier|Gavin Flood|2011|pp=84-86}}&lt;ref name="Krishan1997p17"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yuvraj Krishan |title=The Doctrine of Karma: Its Origin and Development in Brāhmaṇical, Buddhist, and Jaina Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bi6FWX1NOgC |year=1997|publisher= Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|isbn=978-81-208-1233-8 |pages=17–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patrul Rinpoche|author2=Dalai Lama|title=The Words of My Perfect Teacher: A Complete Translation of a Classic Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40i38mGQ6aAC |year=1998|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=978-0-7619-9027-7|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea appears in ancient and medieval texts, as the cycle of life, death, rebirth and redeath, such as section 6:31 of the [[Mahabharata]] and section 6.10 of [[Devi Bhagavata Purana]].{{Sfn|Jessica Frazier|Gavin Flood|2011|pp=84-86}}&lt;ref name=ykrishanp24&gt;Yuvraj Krishan (1988), Is Karma Evolutionary?, Journal of Indian Council of Philosophical Research, Volume 6, pages 24-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=valleepoussin24/&gt;

==History==
The historical origins of a concept of a cycle of repeated [[reincarnation]] are obscure but the idea appears in texts of both India and ancient Greece during the first millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Norman C. McClelland|title=Encyclopedia of Reincarnation and Karma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S_Leq4U5ihkC |year=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5675-8 |pages=102–103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Clifton D.

The idea of Samsara is hinted in the early Vedic texts such as the [[Rigveda]], but the theory is absent.&lt;ref name=amboyer&gt;A.M. Boyer (1901), Etude sur l'origine de la doctrine du samsara, Journal Asiatique, Volume 9, Issue 18, pages 451-453, 459-468&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vallee Pussin|title=The way to Nirvana: six lectures on ancient Buddhism as a discipline of salvation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ito8AAAAIAAJ|year=1917|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early textual layers of the Vedas mention and anticipate the doctrine of [[Karma]] and rebirth, however states Stephen Laumakis, the idea is not fully developed.{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|p=90}} It is in the early Upanishads where these ideas are more fully developed, but there too the discussion does not provide specific mechanistic details.{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|p=90}} The detailed doctrines flower with unique characteristics, starting around the mid 1st millennium BCE, in diverse traditions such as in Buddhism, Jainism and various schools of [[Hindu philosophy]].{{sfn|Stephen J.

Some scholars state that the ''Samsara'' doctrine may have originated from the [[Sramana]] traditions and was then adopted by the Brahmanical traditions (Hinduism).&lt;ref name=floodaithp86&gt;Gavin D. Flood (1996), An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521438780}}, page 86, '''Quote''': “The origin and doctrine of Karma and Samsara are obscure. These concepts were certainly circulating amongst sramanas, and Jainism and Buddhism developed specific and sophisticated ideas about the process of transmigration. It is very possible that the karmas and reincarnation entered the mainstream brahmanical thought from the sramana or the renouncer traditions. Yet, on the other hand, although there is no clear doctrine of transmigration in the vedic hymns, there is the idea of redeath, that a person having died in this world, might die yet again in the next.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Padmanabh S.

In view of the fact that this doctrine is emblazoned on almost every page of sramana scriptures, it is highly probable that it was derived from them."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Govind Chandra Pande, (1994) Life and Thought of Sankaracarya, Motilal Banarsidass {{ISBN|81-208-1104-6}}, page 135, '''Quote''': (...)

=== Punarmrityu: redeath ===
While ''Saṃsāra'' is usually described as rebirth and reincarnation of living beings, the chronological development of the idea over its history began with the questions on what is the true nature of human existence and whether people die only once. This led first to the concepts of ''Punarmṛtyu'' ("redeath") and ''Punaravṛtti'' ("return").&lt;ref name="Doniger1980p268"/&gt;{{Sfn|Buitenen|1957|pp=34-35}}{{Sfn|Mircea Eliade|1987|pp=56-57}} These early theories asserted that the nature of human existence involves two realities, one unchanging absolute [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul) which is somehow connected to the ultimate unchanging immortal reality and bliss called [[Brahman]],{{Sfn|Jessica Frazier|Gavin Flood|2011|p=18}}{{Sfn|John Bowker|2014|pp=84-85}} and that the rest is the always-changing subject (body) in a phenomenal world ([[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]).{{Sfn|Jessica Frazier|Gavin Flood|2011|pp=18-19, 24-25}}{{Sfn|Harold Coward|2012|pp=29-31}}{{Sfn|John Geeverghese Arapura|1986|pp=85-88}} Redeath, in the Vedic theosophical speculations, reflected the end of "blissful years spent in ''svarga'' or heaven", and it was followed by rebirth back in the phenomenal world.&lt;ref name="EllwoodAlles2007p406"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert S.

The dualistic devotional traditions such as [[Madhvacharya]]'s Dvaita Vedanta tradition of Hinduism champion a theistic premise, assert the individual human soul and Brahman (Vishnu, Krishna) are two different realities, loving devotion to Vishnu is the means to release from Samsara, it is the grace of Vishnu which leads to moksha, and spiritual liberation is achievable only in after-life (''videhamukti'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeaneane D.

{{main article|Saṃsāra (Jainism)|Karma in Jainism}}
[[File:Saṃsāra.jpg|thumb|Symbolic depiction of Saṃsāra at Shri Mahaveerji temple of Jainism.]]
In [[Jainism]], the ''Saṃsāra'' and Karma doctrine are central to its theological foundations, as evidenced by the extensive literature on it in the major sects of Jainism, and their pioneering ideas on karma and ''Saṃsāra'' from the earliest times of the Jaina tradition.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=217-236}}&lt;ref name=dundasp14/&gt; ''Saṃsāra'' in Jainism represents the worldly life characterized by continuous rebirths and suffering in various realms of existence.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=226-228}}&lt;ref name=dundasp14&gt;{{cite book|author= Paul Dundas|title=The Jains |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ |year=2003|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-0415266055 |pages= 14–16, 102–105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sethia2004p31"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tara Sethia |title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC |year=2004|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conceptual framework of the Saṃsāra doctrine differs between the Jainism traditions and other Indian religions. For instance, in Jaina traditions, soul (''jiva'') is accepted as a truth, as is assumed in the Hindu traditions, but not assumed in the Buddhist traditions. However, Saṃsāra or the cycle of rebirths, has a definite beginning and end in Jainism.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=226}}

Souls begin their journey in a primordial state, and exist in a state of consciousness continuum that is constantly evolving through ''Saṃsāra''.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=227}} Some evolve to a higher state, some regress asserts the Jaina theory, a movement that is driven by the karma.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=227-228}} Further, Jaina traditions believe that there exist ''Abhavya'' (incapable), or a class of souls that can never attain [[moksha]] (liberation).{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=226}}&lt;ref name="Dundas2003p105"&gt;{{cite book|author= Paul Dundas|title=The Jains |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ |year=2003|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-0415266055 |pages= 104–105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Abhavya'' state of soul is entered after an intentional and shockingly evil act.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=225}} Jainism considers souls as pluralistic each in a karma-''Saṃsāra'' cycle, and does not subscribe to [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] style [[nondualism]] of Hinduism, or [[Madhyamaka|Advaya]] style nondualism of Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Dundas2003p105"/&gt;

The Jaina theosophy, like ancient [[Ajivika]], but unlike Hindu and Buddhist theosophies, asserts that each soul passes through 8,400,000 birth-situations, as they circle through ''Saṃsāra''.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=228}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Padmanabh S. Jaini|title=Collected Papers on Jaina Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HPggiM7y1aYC |year=2000|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1691-6|pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the soul cycles, states Padmanabh Jaini, Jainism traditions believe that it goes through five types of bodies: earth bodies, water bodies, fire bodies, air bodies and vegetable lives.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=223-224}} With all human and non-human activities, such as rainfall, agriculture, eating and even breathing, minuscule living beings are taking birth or dying, their souls are believed to be constantly changing bodies. Perturbing, harming or killing any life form, including any human being, is considered a sin in Jainism, with negative karmic effects.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=224-225}}&lt;ref name="Sethia2004p31"/&gt;

A liberated soul in Jainism is one who has gone beyond ''Saṃsāra'', is at the apex, is omniscient, remains there eternally, and is known as a ''Siddha''.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=222-223}} A male human being is considered closest to the apex with the potential to achieve liberation, particularly through asceticism.

In contrast to Buddhist texts which do not expressly or unambiguously condemn injuring or killing plants and minor life forms, Jaina texts do. Jainism considers it a bad karma to injure plants and minor life forms with negative impact on a soul's {{IAST|Saṃsāra}}.&lt;ref name=lschmithausen&gt;[[Lambert Schmithausen]] (1991), Buddhism and Nature, Studia Philologica Buddhica, The International Institute for Buddhist Studies, Tokyo Japan, pages 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; However, some texts in Buddhism and Hinduism do caution a person from injuring all life forms, including plants and seeds.&lt;ref name=lschmithausen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rod Preece (1999), Animals and Nature: Cultural Myths, Cultural Realities, {{ISBN|978-0-7748-0725-8}}, University of British Columbia Press, pages 212-217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Chapple (1990), Ecological Nonviolence and the Hindu Tradition, in ''Perspectives on Nonviolence'', Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4612-4458-5}}, pages 168-177;&lt;br&gt;L Alsdorf (1962), Beiträge zur Geschichte von Vegetarismus und Rinderverehrung in Indien, Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur, F.

{{main article|Saṃsāra (Buddhism)| Bhavacakra |Six realms}}
''Saṃsāra'' in Buddhism, states Jeff Wilson, is the "suffering-laden cycle of life, death, and rebirth, without beginning or end".&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeff Wilson|year= 2010|title= Saṃsāra and Rebirth, in Buddhism| publisher= Oxford University Press|isbn= 9780195393521| doi=10.1093/obo/9780195393521-0141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also referred to as the wheel of existence (''Bhavacakra''), it is often mentioned in Buddhist texts with the term ''punarbhava'' (rebirth, re-becoming); the liberation from this cycle of existence, ''Nirvana'', is the foundation and the most important purpose of Buddhism.&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conze2013p71"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Conze |title= Buddhist Thought in India: Three Phases of Buddhist Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kY5TAQAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-54231-4|pages=71 }}, '''Quote:''' "Nirvana is the ''raison d’être'' of Buddhism, and its ultimate justification."&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=119}}

Samsara is considered impermanent in Buddhism, just like other Indian religions. Karma drives this impermanent Samsara in Buddhist thought, states Paul Williams, and "short of attaining enlightenment, in each rebirth one is born and dies, to be reborn elsewhere in accordance with the completely impersonal causal nature of one's own karma; This endless cycle of birth, rebirth, and redeath is ''Saṃsāra''".{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=74-75}} The [[Four Noble Truths]], accepted by all Buddhist traditions, are aimed at ending this Samsara-related re-becoming (rebirth) and associated cycles of suffering.{{sfn|Paul Williams|Anthony Tribe|Alexander Wynne|2012|pp=30–42}}{{sfn|Robert Buswell Jr. |Donald Lopez Jr. |2013|pp=304-305}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|editor=Steven M.

The dukkha of these is compounded by the rebirth perspective of Buddhism, for this involves repeated re-birth, re-aging, re-sickness, and re-death."&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Jainism, Buddhism developed its own Samsara theory, that evolved over time the mechanistic details on how the wheel of mundane existence works over the endless cycles of rebirth and redeath.&lt;ref name="Trainor2004p63"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Trainor |title= Buddhism: The Illustrated Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PrloTKuAjwC |year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517398-7 |pages=62–63 }}; '''Quote:''' "Buddhist doctrine holds that until they realize nirvana, beings are bound to undergo rebirth and redeath due to their having acted out of ignorance and desire, thereby producing the seeds of karma".&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dalai Lama|1992|pp=xi-xii, 5-16}} In early Buddhist traditions, ''Saṃsāra'' cosmology consisted of five realms through which wheel of existence recycled.&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt; This included hells (''niraya''), hungry ghosts (''pretas''), animals (''tiryak''), humans (''manushya''), and gods (''devas'', heavenly).&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trainor2004p63"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert DeCaroli |title=Haunting the Buddha: Indian Popular Religions and the Formation of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_2XtkSRyTYC|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-803765-1|pages=94–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In latter traditions, this list grew to a list of six realms of rebirth, adding demi-gods (''asuras'').&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Akira Sadakata|title=Buddhist Cosmology: Philosophy and Origins|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bcYGAAAAYAAJ|year=1997|publisher= Kōsei Publishing 佼成出版社, Tokyo|isbn=978-4-333-01682-2|pages=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "hungry ghost, heavenly, hellish realms" respectively formulate the ritual, literary and moral spheres of many contemporary Buddhist traditions.&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trainor2004p63"/&gt;

The Saṃsāra concept, in Buddhism, envisions that these six realms are interconnected, and everyone cycles life after life, and death is just a state for an afterlife, through these realms, because of a combination of ignorance, desires and purposeful [[karma]], or ethical and unethical actions.&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trainor2004p63"/&gt; Nirvana is typically described as the freedom from rebirth and the only alternative to suffering of ''Samsara'', in Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Collins2010p38"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl B.

=={{IAST|Saṅsāra}} in Sikhism==
Sikhism incorporates the concepts of ''Saṃsāra'' (sometimes spelled as Sansara in Sikh texts), ''Karma'' and cyclical nature of time and existence.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"&gt;{{cite book|author= Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair|title= Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jn_jBAAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-5366-1 |pages=145–146, 181, 220 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=colesambhi13/&gt; Founded in the 15th century, its founder [[Guru Nanak]] had a choice between the cyclical concept of ancient Indian religions and the linear concept of early 7th-century Islam, and he chose the cyclical concept of time, state Cole and Sambhi.&lt;ref name=colesambhi13&gt;{{cite book|author1=W.O. Cole |author2=Piara Singh Sambhi |title=Sikhism and Christianity: A Comparative Study |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8KMCwAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Springer |isbn= 978-1-349-23049-5 |pages= 13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair|title= Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jn_jBAAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-5366-1 |page=176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, states Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair, there are important differences between the ''Saṅsāra'' concept in Sikhism from the ''Saṃsāra'' concept in many traditions within Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"/&gt; The difference is that Sikhism firmly believes in the grace of God as the means to salvation, and its precepts encourage the [[bhakti]] of One Lord for ''mukti'' (salvation).&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=H. S. Singha |title=The Encyclopedia of Sikhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gqIbJz7vMn0C |year=2000|publisher=Hemkunt Press|isbn=978-81-7010-301-1 |pages=68, 80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sikhism, like the three ancient Indian traditions, believes that body is perishable, there is a cycle of rebirth, and that there is suffering with each cycle of rebirth.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh |author2=Louis E.

Rather, it cherishes social engagement and householder's life combined with devotion to the One God as Guru, to be the path of liberation from ''Saṅsāra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh |author2=Louis E.

[[File:Sláinte Mhath .- Bonne santé.jpg|thumb|{{lang|ga|Sláinte Mhath}} — Good health — {{lang|fr|Bonne santé}}]]
{{lang|ga|Sláinte}} is the basic form in [[Irish language|Irish Gaelic]]. Variations of this toast include {{lang|ga|sláinte mhaith}} "good health" in Irish Gaelic ({{lang|ga|mhaith}} being the [[lenition#Grammatical lenition|lenited]] form of {{lang|ga|maith}} "good"). In Irish Gaelic, the response to {{lang|ga|sláinte}} is {{lang|ga|sláinte agad-sa}}, which translates "to your health as well".

The basic [[Scottish Gaelic]] equivalent is {{lang|gd|slàinte (mhath)}}, with the same meaning, to which the normal response is {{lang|gd|do dheagh shlàinte}} "your good health".&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|ga|Ó Maolalaigh, R.}} ''Scottish Gaelic in three months'' Hugo Language Books, 1996 {{ISBN|0-85285-234-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are other variations such as:

==Etymology==
The word is an [[abstract noun]] derived from the [[Old Irish]] [[adjective]] {{lang|sga|slán}} "whole, healthy" plus the Old Irish [[suffix]] {{lang|sga|tu}}, resulting in {{lang|sga|slántu}} "health" and eventually [[Middle Irish]] {{lang|mga|sláinte}}.&lt;ref&gt;MacBain, A. (1911) ''An Etymological Dictionary of the Gaelic Language'' [[Stirling]] Eneas MacKay, 1982 edition by Gairm {{ISBN|0-901771-68-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oftedal, M. (1956) ''The Gaelic of Leurbost''. Oslo. Norsk Tidskrift for Sprogvidenskap.&lt;/ref&gt; The root {{lang|sga|slán}} is derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European root]] ''*slā-'' "advantageous" and linked to words like [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|selig}} "blessed" and the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|salus}} "health".&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Pokorny|Pokorny, J.]] {{lang|de|Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch}} Online Edition [http://www.indo-european.nl/cgi-bin/startq.cgi?flags=endnnnl&amp;root=leiden&amp;basename=\data\ie\pokorny] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210072140/http://www.indo-european.nl/cgi-bin/startq.cgi?flags=endnnnl&amp;root=leiden&amp;basename=%5Cdata%5Cie%5Cpokorny |date=2010-12-10 }} retrieved 8 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In some modern [[Romance language]]s, words descended from the Latin word {{lang|la|salus}} (such as {{lang|it|salute}} in [[Italian language|Italian]], {{lang|ca|salut}} in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]], {{lang|es|salud}} in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) are similarly used as a toast. (However, {{lang|ro|sănătate}} in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], {{lang|oc|santat}} in [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and {{lang|fr|santé}} in [[French language|French]] are rather from Latin {{lang|la|sanitas}} "health.")

Although health research is often organized by disease categories or organ systems, theoretical development in social epidemiology is typically organized around factors that influence health (i.e., health determinants rather than health outcomes). Many social factors are thought to be relevant for a wide range of health domains. Social epidemiology can therefore address any health outcome, including chronic disease, infectious disease, mental health, and clinical outcomes or disease prognosis. Exposures of interest to social epidemiologists include individual-level measures (e.g., poverty, education, social isolation), contextual factors (e.g., residential segregation or income inequality), and social policies (e.g., policies creating income security or promoting educational access). Analyses that address the independent or synergistic effects of individual or contextual risk factors are often of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9491010 |pmc=1508189 |year=1998 |author1=Diez-Roux |first1=A.

For example, questions of interest to epidemiologists include:{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
* Why have racial and economic inequalities in premature mortality persisted for generations even as the specific diseases causing premature death have completely changed?
* Do changes in social policies regulating social safety nets, human capital development, employment, occupational conditions, housing, or residential segregation influence the health of individuals? 
* Do social conditions at specific periods of life, for example early life developmental periods, disproportionately influence later health outcomes compared to exposures at later ages?
* Do adverse experiences such as chronic psychological stress, trauma, racism, or shame influence health and if so, what are the biological mechanisms of these effects?

Social epidemiology draws on methodologies and theoretical frameworks from many disciplines, and research overlaps with several social science fields, most notably [[economics]], [[medical anthropology]], [[medical sociology]], [[health psychology]] and [[medical geography]], as well as many domains of epidemiology.  However, intersecting social science fields often use health and disease in order to explain specifically social phenomenon (such as the growth of lay [[health advocacy]] movements),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7560848 |jstor=2626956 |year=1995 |author1=Brown |first1=P |title=Naming and framing: The social construction of diagnosis and illness |journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior |volume=Spec No |pages=34–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while social epidemiologists generally use social concepts in order to explain patterns of health in the population.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

More recently, the discipline is moving from identifying health inequalities along the social gradient to identifying the policies, programmes and interventions that effectively tackle the observed socioeconomic inequalities in health. Researchers Frank Pega and Ichiro Kawachi from Harvard University have suggested that this may lead to the new discipline of Political Epidemiology, which is more policy-applied in that it identifies effective and cost-effecfive social interventions for government action to improve health equity.&lt;ref name="doi10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.06.007"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Politics, policies and population health: a commentary on Mackenbach, Hu and Looman (2013) |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=93 |pages=176–9 |year=2013 |doi= 10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.06.007 |last1=Pega |first1=Frank |last2=Kawachi |first2=Ichiro |last3=Rasanathan |first3=Kumanan  |last4=Lundberg |first4=Olle }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Linguistics}}

'''Speech''' is human vocal [[communication]] using [[language]]. Each language uses [[phonetic]] combinations of a limited set of perfectly articulated and individualized [[vowel]] and [[consonant]] sounds that form the sound of its words (that is, all English words sound different from all French words, even if they are the same word, e.g., "role" or "hotel"), and using those words in their semantic character as  words in the [[lexicon]] of a [[language]] according to the [[Syntax|syntactic]] constraints that govern lexical words' function in a sentence. In speaking, speakers perform many different intentional [[Speech_act|speech act]]s, e.g., informing, declaring, asking, persuading, directing, and can use [[Elocution|enunciation]], [[Intonation_(linguistics)|intonation]], degrees of [[Loudness|loudness]], [[Tempo|tempo]], and other non-representational or [[Paralanguage|paralinguistic]] aspects of vocalization to convey meaning.  In their speech speakers also unintentionally communicate many aspects of their social position such as sex, age, place of origin (through [[Accent_(sociolinguistics)|accent]]), physical states (alertness and sleepiness, vigor or weakness, health or illness), psychic states (emotions or moods), physico-psychic states (sobriety or [[Alcohol_intoxication|drunkenness]], normal consciousness and [[Trance|trance]] states), education or experience, and the like.  

Although people ordinarily use speech in dealing with other persons (or animals), when people [[Profanity|swear]] they do not always mean to communicate anything to anyone, and sometimes in expressing urgent emotions or desires they use speech as a quasi-magical cause, as when they encourage a player in a game to do or warn them not to do something.  There are also many situations in which people engage in solitary speech. People [[Talking to oneself|talk to themselves]] sometimes in acts that are a development of what some [[psychologist]]s (e.g., [[Lev Vygotsky]]) have maintained is the use in thinking of silent speech in an [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|interior monologue]] to vivify and organize [[cognition]], sometimes in the momentary adoption of a dual persona as self addressing self as though addressing another person.  Solo speech can be used [[Memorization|to memorize]] or to test one's memorization of things, and in [[Prayer|prayer]] or in [[Meditation|meditation]] (e.g., the use of a [[Mantra|mantra]]).

Researchers study many different aspects of speech:  speech production and [[speech perception]] of the [[sounds]] used in a [[language]], [[speech repetition]], [[speech error]]s, the ability to map heard spoken words onto the vocalizations needed to recreate them, which plays a key role in [[children]]'s enlargement of their [[vocabulary]], and what different areas of the [[human brain]], such as [[Broca's area]] and [[Wernicke's area]], underlie speech. Speech is the subject of study for  [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], [[communication studies]], [[psychology]], [[computer science]], [[speech pathology]], [[otolaryngology]], and [[acoustics]].  
Speech compares with [[written language]]&lt;ref&gt;{{American Heritage Dictionary|https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=speech|Speech}}&lt;/ref&gt;
, which may differ in its vocabulary, syntax, and phonetics from the spoken language, a situation called [[diglossia]]. 

The evolutionary [[origin of language|origins of speech]] are unknown and subject to much debate and [[speculation]]. While [[Animal language|animals also communicate]] using vocalizations, and trained [[apes]] such as [[Washoe (chimpanzee)|Washoe]] and [[Kanzi]] can use simple [[Sign_language|sign language]], no animals' vocalizations are articulated phonemically and syntactically, and do not constitute speech.

== Production ==
{{main|Speech production|Linguistics}}

Speech production is a multi-step process by which thoughts are generated into spoken utterances. Production involves the selection of appropriate words and the appropriate form of those words from the lexicon and morphology, and the organization of those words through the syntax. Then, the phonetic properties of the words are retrieved and the sentence is uttered through the articulations associated with those phonetic properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levelt|first=Willem J. M.|date=|year=1999|title=Models of word production|url=|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=3|issue=6|pages=223–232|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01319-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]] ([[articulatory phonetics]]), [[Articulation (phonetics)|articulation]] refers to how the tongue, lips, jaw, vocal cords, and other speech organs used to produce sounds are used to make sounds. Speech sounds are categorized by [[manner of articulation]] and [[place of articulation]]. Place of articulation refers to where the airstream in the mouth is constricted. Manner of articulation refers to the manner in which the speech organs interact, such as how closely the air is restricted, what form of airstream is used (e.g. [[Pulmonic consonant|pulmonic]], implosive, ejectives, and clicks), whether or not the vocal cords are vibrating, and whether the nasal cavity is opened to the airstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Language &amp; Linguistics|last=Catford|first=J.C.|last2=Esling|first2=J.H.|publisher=Elsevier Science|year=2006|isbn=|editor-last=Brown|editor-first=Kieth|edition=2nd|location=Amsteram|pages=425–442|chapter=Articulatory Phonetics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is primarily used for the production of [[consonant]]s, but can be used for vowels in qualities such as [[Voicing (phonetics)|voicing]] and [[nasalization]]. For any [[place of articulation]], there may be several manners of articulation, and therefore several [[homorganic]] consonants.

Normal human speech is pulmonic, produced with pressure from the [[lung]]s, which creates [[phonation]] in the [[glottis]] in the [[larynx]], which is then modified by the [[vocal tract]] and mouth into different [[vowel]]s and [[consonant]]s. However humans can pronounce words without the use of the lungs and glottis in [[alaryngeal speech]], of which there are three types: [[esophageal speech]], pharyngeal speech and buccal speech (better known as [[Donald Duck talk]]).

=== Speech errors ===
{{main|Speech error}}

Speech production is a complex activity, and as a consequence errors are common, especially in children. Speech errors come in many forms and are often used to provide evidence to support hypotheses about the nature of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Speech Errors as Linguistic Evidence|last=Fromkin|first=Victoria|publisher=Mouton|year=1973|isbn=|location=The Hague|pages=11–46|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, speech errors are often used in the construction of models for language production and [[Language acquisition|child language acquisition]]. For example, the fact that children often make the error of over-regularizing the -ed past tense suffix in English (e.g. saying 'singed' instead of 'sang') shows that the regular forms are acquired earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plunkett|first=Kim|last2=Juola|first2=Patrick|date=|year=1999|title=A connectionist model of english past tense and plural morphology|url=|journal=Cognitive Science|volume=23|issue=4|pages=463–490|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2304_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicoladis|first=Elena|last2=Paradis|first2=Johanne|date=|title=Acquiring Regular and Irregular Past Tense Morphemes in English and French: Evidence From Bilingual Children|url=|journal=Language Learning|volume=62|issue=1|pages=170–197|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9922.2010.00628.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speech errors associated with certain kinds of aphasia have been used to map certain components of speech onto the brain and see the relation between different aspects of production: for example, the difficulty of [[expressive aphasia]] patients in producing regular past-tense verbs, but not irregulars like 'sing-sang' has been used to demonstrate that regular inflected forms of a word are not individually stored in the lexicon, but produced from affixation of the base form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ullman|first=Michael T.|display-authors=etal|date=|year=2005|title=Neural correlates of lexicon and grammar: Evidence from the production, reading, and judgement of inflection in aphasia.|url=|journal=Brain and Language|volume=93|pages=185–238|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2004.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perception==
{{main|Speech perception}}

Speech perception refers to the processes by which humans can interpret and understand the sounds used in language. The study of speech perception is closely linked to the fields of [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]] in linguistics and cognitive psychology and perception in psychology. Research in speech perception seeks to understand how listeners recognize speech sounds and use this information to understand [[spoken language]]. Research into speech perception also has applications in building [[speech recognition|computer systems that can recognize speech]], as well as improving speech recognition for hearing- and language-impaired listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennison |first=Shelia |year=2013 |title=Introduction to Language Development |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Sage.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speech perception is [[Categorical perception|categorical]], in that people put the sounds they hear into categories rather than perceiving them as a spectrum. People are more likely to be able to hear differences in sounds across categorical boundaries than within them. A good example of this is [[Voice-onset time|voice onset time]] (VOT). For example, Hebrew speakers, who distinguish voiced /b/ from voiceless /p/, will more easily detect a change in VOT from -10 ( perceived as /b/ ) to 0 ( perceived as /p/ ) than a change in VOT from +10 to +20, or -10 to -20, despite this being an equally large change on the VOT spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kishon-Rabin|first=Liat|last2=Rotshtein|first2=Shira|last3=Taitelbaum|first3=Riki|date=|year=2002|title=Underlying Mechanism for Categorical Perception: Tone-Onset Time and Voice-Onset Time Evidence of Hebrew Voicing|url=|journal=Journal of Basic and Clinical Physiology and Pharmacology|volume=13|issue=2|pages=117–134|doi=10.1515/jbcpp.2002.13.2.117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repetition==
{{main|Speech repetition}}

In speech repetition, speech being heard is quickly turned from sensory input into motor instructions needed for its immediate or delayed vocal imitation (in [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Phonological loop|phonological memory]]). This type of mapping plays a key role in enabling children to expand their spoken vocabulary. Masur (1995) found that how often children repeat novel words versus those they already have in their lexicon is related to the size of their lexicon later on, with young children who repeat more novel words having a larger lexicon later in development. Speech repetition could help facilitate the acquisition of this larger lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masur|first=Elise|year=1995|title=Infants' Early Verbal Imitation and Their Later Lexical Development|url=|journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly|volume=41|issue=3|pages=286–306|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems involving speech==
{{See also|Speech-language pathology}}

There are several organic and psychological factors that can affect speech. Among these are:

#Diseases and disorders of the [[lung]]s or the [[vocal cords]], including [[paralysis]], respiratory infections (bronchitis), [[vocal fold nodules]] and [[cancer]]s of the lungs and throat.
#Diseases and disorders of the [[brain]], including [[alogia]], [[aphasia]]s, [[dysarthria]], [[dystonia]] and [[speech processing]] disorders, where impaired [[motor planning]], nerve transmission, phonological processing or perception of the message (as opposed to the actual sound) leads to poor speech production.
#Hearing problems, such as [[otitis media|otitis media with effusion]], and listening problems, [[auditory processing disorder]]s, can lead to phonological problems.
#Articulatory problems, such as [[relaxed pronunciation|slurred speech]], [[stuttering]], [[lisp (speech)|lisping]], [[cleft palate]], [[ataxia]], or [[nerve]] damage leading to problems in [[Manner of articulation|articulation]]. [[Tourette syndrome]] and [[tic]]s can also affect speech. Various [[congenital disorder|congenital]] and acquired [[tongue disease]]s can affect speech as can [[motor neuron disease]].
#In addition to [[dysphasia]], [[Anomic aphasia|anomia]] and [[auditory processing disorder]] can impede the quality of auditory perception, and therefore, expression.  Those who are [[deafness|Hard of Hearing]] or deaf may be considered to fall into this category.

==Brain physiology==

=== The classical model ===
[[File:BrocasAreaSmall.png|thumb|180x180px|Broca's and Wernicke's areas.]]

The classical or [[Wernicke–Geschwind model|Wernicke-Geschwind model]] of the language system in the brain focuses on [[Broca's area]] in the inferior [[prefrontal cortex]], and [[Wernicke's area]] in the posterior [[superior temporal gyrus]] on the [[Lateralization of brain function|dominant hemisphere]] of the brain (typically the left hemisphere for language). In this model, a linguistic auditory signal is first sent from the [[auditory cortex]] to Wernicke's area. The [[lexicon]] is accessed in Wernicke's area, and these words are sent via the [[arcuate fasciculus]] to Broca's area, where morphology, syntax, and instructions for articulation are generated. This is then sent from Broca's area to the [[motor cortex]] for articulation.&lt;ref&gt;Kertesz, A. (2005). "Wernicke--GeschwindModel". In L. Nadel, ''Encyclopedia of cognitive science''. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Broca]] identified an approximate region of the brain in 1861 which, when damaged in two of his patients, caused severe deficits in speech production, where his patients were unable to speak beyond a few monosyllabic words. This deficit, known as Broca's or [[expressive aphasia]], is characterized by difficulty in speech production where speech is slow and labored, function words are absent, and syntax is severely impaired, as in [[telegraphic speech]].

"Aphasia". In L. Nadel, ''Encyclopedia of cognitive science''. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Wernicke's area is named after [[Carl Wernicke]], who in 1874 proposed a connection between damage to the posterior area of the left superior temporal gyrus and aphasia, as he noted that not all aphasic patients had suffered damage to the prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reader in the History of Aphasia: From '''sasi'''(Franz Gall to)|publisher=John Benjamins Pub Co|year=1995|isbn=90-272-1893-5|volume=4|location=Amsterdam|pages=69–89|chapter=The aphasia symptom-complex: A psychological study on an anatomical basis (1875)|author=Wernicke K.|editor=Paul Eling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage to Wernicke's area produces Wernicke's or [[receptive aphasia]], which is characterized by relatively normal syntax and prosody but severe impairment in lexical access, resulting in poor comprehension and nonsensical or [[Jargon aphasia|jargon speech]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Modern research ===
Modern models of the neurological systems behind linguistic comprehension and production recognize the importance of Broca's and Wernicke's areas, but are not limited to them nor solely to the left hemisphere. &lt;ref name="Nakai_2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Jeong|first2=JW|last3=Brown|first3=EC|last4=Rothermel|first4=R|last5=Kojima|first5=K|last6=Kambara|first6=T|last7=Shah|first7=A|last8=Mittal|first8=S|last9=Sood|first9=S|last10=Asano|first10=E|year=2017|title=Three- and four-dimensional mapping of speech and language in patients with epilepsy|journal=Brain|volume=140|pages=1351-1370|doi=10.1093/brain/awx051|pmid=28334963|last1=Nakai|first1=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, multiple streams are involved in speech production and comprehension. Damage to the left [[lateral sulcus]] has been connected with difficulty in processing and producing morphology and syntax, while lexical access and comprehension of irregular forms (e.g. eat-ate) remain unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Perception of Speech: from sound to meaning.|last=Tyler|first=Lorraine K.|last2=Marslen-Wilson|first2=William|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-956131-5|editor-last=Moore|editor-first=Brian C.

In [[fiction]], a '''subplot''' is a secondary strand of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]  that is a supporting side story for any story or the main plot. Subplots may connect to main plots, in either time and place or in thematic significance. Subplots often involve supporting characters, those besides the [[protagonist]] or [[antagonist]]. Subplots may also intertwine with the main plot at some point in a story.

Subplots are distinguished from the main plot by taking up less of the action, having fewer significant events occur, with less impact on the "world" of the work, and occurring to less important characters.  

In [[screenwriting]], a subplot is referred to as a "B story" or a "C story," etc.

"'''To Be Young, Gifted and Black'''" is a song by [[Nina Simone]] with [[lyrics]] by [[Weldon Irvine]]. It was written in memory of Simone's late friend [[Lorraine Hansberry]], author of the play ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'', who had died in 1965 aged 34. The song was originally recorded and released by Simone in 1969, also featuring on her 1970 album ''[[Black Gold (Nina Simone album)|Black Gold]]'', and was a [[Civil Rights Movement]] anthem. Released as a [[Single (music)|single]], it peaked at number eight on the R&amp;B chart and number 76 on the [[Hot 100]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable [[cover version]]s of the song were recorded by [[Donny Hathaway]] (on his 1970 album ''[[Everything Is Everything (Donny Hathaway album)|Everything Is Everything]]''), [[Aretha Franklin]] (on her 1972 album ''[[Young, Gifted and Black]]'') and [[Bob and Marcia]] (whose 1970 recording reached number 5 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and number 15 in Ireland).&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4777">{{About|the void type in computer programming languages|types of astronomical voids|Void (astronomy)|other uses|Void (disambiguation)}}

The '''Void type''', in several [[Curly bracket programming language|programming languages derived from C and Algol68]], is the [[type theory|type]] for the result of a [[function (computer science)|function]] that returns normally, but does not provide a result value to its caller.  Usually such functions are called for their [[Side effect (computer science)|side effects]], such as performing some task or writing to their output parameters. The usage of the void type in such context is comparable to [[Procedure (computer science)|procedures]] in [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]] and syntactic constructs which define [[subroutines]] in [[Visual Basic]]. It is also similar to the [[unit type]] used in [[functional programming languages]] and type theory.  See [[Unit type#In programming languages]] for a comparison.

[[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] also support the '''pointer to void type''' (specified as &lt;code&gt;void *&lt;/code&gt;), but this is an unrelated notion. Variables of this type are [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]s to data of an ''unspecified'' type, so in this context (but not the others) &lt;code&gt;void *&lt;/code&gt; acts roughly like a universal or [[top type]]. A program can probably convert a pointer to any type of data (except a [[function pointer]]) to a pointer to void and back to the original type without losing information, which makes these pointers useful for [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphic]] functions. The C language standard does not guarantee that the different pointer types have the same size.

== In C and C++ ==

A function with void result type ends either by reaching the end of the function or by executing a [[return statement]] with no returned value. The void type may also appear as the sole [[Parameter (computer programming)|argument]] of a [[function prototype]] to indicate that the function takes no arguments. Note that despite the name, in all of these situations, the void type serves as a [[unit type]], not as a zero or [[bottom type]] (which 
is sometimes confusingly called the "void type"), even though unlike a real unit type which is a singleton, the void type lacks a way to represent its value and the language does not provide any way to declare an object or represent a value with type &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt;.

In the earliest versions of C, functions with no specific result defaulted to a return type of &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and functions with no arguments simply had empty argument lists. Pointers to untyped data were declared as integers or pointers to &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;. Some early C [[compiler]]s had the feature, now seen as an annoyance, of generating a warning on any function call that did not use the function's returned value. Old code sometimes [[Type conversion|casts]] such function calls to void to suppress this warning.  By the time [[Bjarne Stroustrup]] began his work on [[C++]] in 1979–1980, void and void pointers were part of the C language dialect supported by AT&amp;T-derived compilers.&lt;ref&gt;http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/chist.html, "Standardisation."&lt;/ref&gt;

The explicit use of void vs. giving no arguments in a [[function prototype]] has different semantics in C and C++, as detailed in the following table:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stroustrup | first = Bjarne | title = Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++| publisher = Addison-Wesley | location = Boston | year = 2009 | isbn = 0-321-54372-6 | page=996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|  &lt;code&gt;void f();&lt;/code&gt; (''accepts a constant but unknown number of arguments'')
|  ''no equivalent''
|}

A C prototype taking no arguments, e.g. &lt;code&gt;void f()&lt;/code&gt; above, has been deprecated in [[C99]]&lt;ref&gt;Bjarne Stroustrup, ''[http://www.ddj.com/cpp/184401562 C and C++: Case Studies in Compatibility. Reconcilable differences? You decide]'', [[Dr. Dobb's]], September 01, 2002; [http://www.research.att.com/~bs/examples_short.pdf print version]&lt;/ref&gt;, however.

==In Haskell==

Quite contrary to C++, in the [[functional programming language]] [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] the void type denotes the empty type, which has no inhabitants [http://hackage.haskell.org/package/void]. A function into the void type does not return results, and a side-effectful program with type signature  &lt;code&gt;IO Void&lt;/code&gt;  does not terminate, or crashes. In particular, there are no [[total functions]] into the void type.

The '''Wason selection task''' (or '''''four-card problem''''') is a [[logic puzzle]] devised by [[Peter Cathcart Wason]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wason | first1 = P. C. | year = 1968 | title = Reasoning about a rule | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 273–281 | doi=10.1080/14640746808400161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Wason | first=P.

I.|title=Reasoning and Thinking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6XpBCZDcCtIC&amp;pg=PA8|year=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-86377-708-0|page=8|quote=The Wason selection task has often been claimed to be the single most investigated experimental paradigm in the psychology of reasoning.}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the puzzle is:

{{quote|You are shown a set of four cards placed on a table, each of which has a number on one side and a colored patch on the other side.  The visible faces of the cards show 3, 8, red and brown.  Which card(s) must you turn over in order to test the truth of the proposition that if a card shows an even number on one face, then its opposite face is red?}}

A response that identifies a card that need not be inverted, or that fails to identify a card that needs to be inverted, is incorrect. The original task dealt with numbers (even, odd) and letters (vowels, consonants).

The test is of special interest because people have a hard time solving it in most scenarios but can usually solve it correctly in certain contexts. In particular, researchers have found that the puzzle is readily solved when the imagined context is policing a social rule.

==Solution==
The correct response is to turn over the 8 and the brown card.

The rule was "''If'' the card shows an even number on one face, ''then'' its opposite face is red." Only a card with both an even number on one face ''and'' something other than red on the other face can invalidate this rule:
* If the 3 card is red (or brown), that doesn't violate the rule. The rule makes no claims about odd numbers.
* If the 8 card is not red, it violates the rule.
* If the red card is odd (or even), that doesn't violate the rule. The red color is not exclusive to even numbers.
* If the brown card is even, it violates the rule.

===Use of logic===
The interpretation of "if" here is that of the [[material conditional]] in [[classical logic]], so this problem can be solved by choosing the cards using [[modus ponens]] (all even cards must be checked to ensure they are red) and [[modus tollens]] (all non-red cards must be checked to ensure they are non-even).

==Explanations of performance on the task==
In Wason's study, not even 10% of subjects found the correct solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=P. C. |last=Wason |year=1977 |chapter=Self-contradictions |editor-link=Philip Johnson-Laird |editor-first=P. N. |editor-last=Johnson-Laird |editor2-first=P. C. |editor2-last=Wason |title=Thinking: Readings in cognitive science |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521217563 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This result was replicated in 1993.&lt;ref name="EvansNewstead1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=Jonathan St. B. T.|last2=Newstead|first2=Stephen E.|last3=Byrne|first3=Ruth M. J.|title=Human Reasoning: The Psychology of Deduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iFMhZ4dl1KcC|year=1993|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-86377-313-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have argued that participants do not read "if... then..." as the material conditional, since the natural language conditional is not the material conditional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oaksford |first=M. |last2=Chater |first2=N. |year=1994 |title=A rational analysis of the selection task as optimal data selection |journal=[[Psychological Review]] |volume=101 |issue=4 |pages=608–631 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.101.4.608 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stenning |first=K. |last2=van Lambalgen |first2=M. |year=2004 |title=A little logic goes a long way: basing experiment on semantic theory in the cognitive science of conditional reasoning |journal=Cognitive Science |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=481–530 |doi=10.1016/j.cogsci.2004.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vonSydow2006"/&gt; (See also the [[paradoxes of the material conditional]] for more information.)  However one interesting feature of the task is how participants react when the classical logic solution is explained:
{{quote|A psychologist, not very well disposed toward logic, once confessed to me that despite all problems in short-term inferences like the Wason Card Task, there was also the undeniable fact that he had never met an experimental subject who did not understand the logical solution when it was explained to him, and then agreed that it was correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Johan |last=van Benthem |year=2008 |title=Logic and reasoning: do the facts matter? |journal=Studia Logica |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=67–84 |doi=10.1007/s11225-008-9101-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This latter comment is also controversial, since it does not explain whether the subjects regarded their previous solution incorrect, or whether they regarded the problem sufficiently vague to have two interpretations.

===Policing social rules===
As of 1983, experimenters had identified that success on the Wason selection task was highly content-dependent, but there was no theoretical explanation for which content elicited mostly correct responses and which ones elicited mostly incorrect responses.&lt;ref name="cogadapt"/&gt;
[[File:Wason selection task cards - drinking variant.svg|350px|right|thumb|Each card has an age on one side, and a drink on the other. Which card(s) must be turned over to test the idea that if you are drinking alcohol then you must be over 18?]]
[[Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] [[Leda Cosmides]] and [[John Tooby]] (1992) identified that the selection task tends to produce the "correct" response when presented in a context of [[social relation]]s.&lt;ref name="cogadapt"/&gt; For example, if the rule used is "If you are drinking alcohol then you must be over 18", and the cards have an age on one side and beverage on the other, e.g., "16", "drinking beer", "25", "drinking coke", most people have no difficulty in selecting the correct cards ("16" and "beer").&lt;ref name="cogadapt"/&gt; In a series of experiments in different contexts, subjects demonstrated consistent superior performance when asked to police a social rule involving a benefit that was only legitimately available to someone who had qualified for that benefit.&lt;ref name="cogadapt"/&gt; Cosmides and Tooby argued that experimenters have ruled out alternative explanations, such as that people learn the rules of social exchange through practice and find it easier to apply these familiar rules than less-familiar rules.&lt;ref name="cogadapt"/&gt;

According to Cosmides and Tooby, this experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that a Wason task proves to be easier if the rule to be tested is one of social exchange (''in order to receive benefit X you need to fulfill condition Y'') and the subject is asked to police the rule, but is more difficult otherwise. They argued that such a distinction, if empirically borne out, would support the contention of evolutionary psychologists that human [[reason]]ing is governed by context-sensitive mechanisms that have evolved, through [[natural selection]], to solve specific problems of social interaction, rather than context-free, general-purpose mechanisms.&lt;ref name="cogadapt"&gt;{{cite book | last=Cosmides | first=L. | authorlink=Leda Cosmides |last2=Tooby|first2= J.  | editor-last1=Barkow |editor-first1=J.| editor-last2=Cosmides | editor-first2=L. | editor-last3=Tooby|editor-first3= J.  | chapter=Cognitive Adaptions for Social Exchange |title= The adapted mind: Evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture| year=1992 | location=New York | publisher=Oxford University Press |chapterurl=http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/papers/Cogadapt.pdf|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTzuAAAAMAAJ|pp=163–228 |isbn=978-0-19-506023-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the module is described as a specialized cheater-detection module.&lt;ref name="cogadapt"/&gt;

=== Evaluation of social relations hypothesis ===
Davies et al. (1995) have argued that Cosmides and Tooby's argument in favor of context-sensitive, domain-specific reasoning mechanisms as opposed to general-purpose reasoning mechanisms is theoretically incoherent and inferentially unjustified.&lt;ref name="DFF"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Davies |first1= Paul Sheldon |last2= Fetzer |first2= James H. |last3= Foster |first3= Thomas R. |year= 1995 |title= Logical reasoning and domain specificity |journal= [[Biology and Philosophy]] |volume= 10 |issue= 1 |pages= 1–37 |publisher= |doi= 10.1007/BF00851985 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Sydow (2006) has argued that we have to distinguish deontic and descriptive conditionals, but that the logic of testing deontic conditionals is more systematic (cf. Beller, 2001) and depend on one's goals (cf. Sperber &amp; Girotto, 2002).&lt;ref name="vonSydow2006"&gt;{{cite book | last=von Sydow| first=M. | title= Towards a Flexible Bayesian and Deontic Logic of Testing Descriptive and Prescriptive Rules| year=2006| location=Göttingen | publisher=Göttingen University Press |url=https://ediss.uni-goettingen.de/handle/11858/00-1735-0000-0006-AC29-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beller2001"&gt;{{cite book | last=Beller| first=S. | authorlink= |editor-last1=Moore|editor-first1=J.D. | editor-last2=Stenning|editor-first2= K. | chapter=A model theory of deontic reasoning about social norms |title= Proceedings of the 23rd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society| year=2001 | location=Mahwah, NJ.| publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum |chapterurl=|url=|pp=63–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sperber |first=D.|last2=Girotto|first2=V.|year=2002 |title=Use or misuse of the selection task? |journal=Cognition |volume=85 |issue= |pages=277–290. |doi= 10.1016/s0010-0277(02)00125-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in response to [[Satoshi Kanazawa|Kanazawa]] (2010),&lt;ref name="Kanazawa2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kanazawa|first1=Satoshi|author-link1=Satoshi Kanazawa|year=May–June 2010|title=Evolutionary Psychology and Intelligence Research|journal=[[American Psychologist]]|volume=65|issue=4|pages=279–289|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|doi=10.1037/a0019378|url=http://personal.lse.ac.uk/Kanazawa/pdfs/AP2010.pdf|accessdate=February 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scott Barry Kaufman|Kaufman]] et al.
