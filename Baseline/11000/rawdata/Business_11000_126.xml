'''Robert Michael "Bobby" Godsell''' (born 14 September 1952 in [[Johannesburg]])&lt;ref name="Who" &gt;[http://www.whoswhosa.co.za/user/984 Bobby Godsell] Who'swho South Africa, accessed: 8 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; is a retired South African businessman and the former CEO of [[South Africa]]n [[gold mining]] company [[AngloGold Ashanti]], a position he held from 1998 to 2007. He was the Non-Executive Chairman of [[Eskom]] from 2008 to 2009 and was appointed to the [[National Planning Commission of South Africa]] by former [[President of South Africa|South African President]] [[Jacob Zuma]] on 30 April 2010.&lt;ref name="Who" /&gt;

His departure from Eskom in 2009 was under controversial circumstances, caused by a board room struggle with the company's CEO, Jacob Maroga. Godsell decided to resign while Maoga was later sacked. Godsell found himself accused of racism but was defended by both NUM ([[National Union of Mineworkers (South Africa)|National Union of Mineworkers]]) and the ANC ([[African National Congress]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://fin24.com/Companies/ANC-Godsell-isnt-a-racist-20091110 ANC: Godsell isn't a racist] fin24.com, published: 10 November 2009, accessed: 8 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page72308?oid=150425&amp;sn=Detail Godsell is no racist – NUM] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304144922/http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page72308?oid=150425&amp;sn=Detail |date=4 March 2012 }} politicsweb.co.za, published: 10 November 2009, accessed: 8 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-11-13-sa-wants-godsell-back-at-eskom SA wants Godsell back at Eskom] ''[[Mail &amp; Guardian]] online'', published: 13 November 2009, accessed: 8 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/use-of-the-race-card-at-eskom-roundly-condemned-2009-11-10 Use of the race card at Eskom roundly condemned] engineeringnews.co.za, published: 10 November 2009, accessed: 8 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Godsell completed a master of arts degree at the [[University of Cape Town]], followed by a bachelor's degree at the [[University of Natal]].&lt;ref name="Who" /&gt;

He became an executive director of [[Anglo American plc|Anglo American]] in 1991. He served at the [[South African Chamber of Mines]], first as a vice-president and later as its president. He was also chairman of the [[World Gold Council]] from 2001 to 2002.&lt;ref name="Who" /&gt;

Bobby Godsell was appointed CEO of the gold and uranium division of Anglo American in July 1995 and CEO of [[AngloGold]] in April 1998.&lt;ref name="Retire"&gt;[http://www.anglogoldashanti.com/Additional/Press/2007/Bobby+Godsell+Retires+as+CEO+at+AngloGold+Ashanti.htm Bobby Godsell Retires as CEO at AngloGold Ashanti]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904021243/http://www.anglogoldashanti.com/Additional/Press/2007/Bobby%2BGodsell%2BRetires%2Bas%2BCEO%2Bat%2BAngloGold%2BAshanti.htm |date=4 September 2011  }} AGA website, published: 31 July 2007, accessed: 8 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

As CEO, he oversaw, alongside [[Sam E. Jonah]], the merger of AngloGold and the [[Ashanti Goldfields Corporation]], announced on 16 May 2003 and completed on 26 April 2004, to form AngloGold Ashanti.&lt;ref name="Annualfive"&gt;[http://www.anglogoldashanti.co.za/subwebs/InformationForInvestors/AnnualReport05/report/pdf/ar_report_2005.pdf Annual Report 2005] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719053855/http://www.anglogoldashanti.co.za/subwebs/InformationForInvestors/AnnualReport05/report/pdf/ar_report_2005.pdf# |date=19 July 2011 }} AngloGold Ashanti website, accessed: 11 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20040427/pdf/3lcm4sthtp2jz.pdf Completion of merger of Anglogold Limited/Ashanti Goldfields] AngloGold Ashanti ASX announcement, published: 27 April 2004, accessed: 10 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Godsell announced his retirement on 31 July 2010 and retired from his position as CEO of AngloGold Ashanti on 30 September 2007, being replaced by Australian [[Mark Cutifani]].&lt;ref name="Annualseven"&gt;[http://www.anglogoldashanti.com/Downloads/Downloads.htm Annual Report 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024004730/http://www.anglogoldashanti.com/Downloads/Downloads.htm |date=24 October 2010 }} AngloGold Ashanti website, accessed: 8 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that, after 34 years in corporate life he was looking forward to exploring new ways of being a constructive citizen in his country, South Africa.&lt;ref name="Retire" /&gt;

He returned from retirement in 2008, when he became the non-executive chairman of [[Eskom]] but resigned from the position in 2009. He remains a non-executive director of the Anglo American Corp., a position he has held since 1991. He is also the chairman of [[Business Leadership South Africa]] and has been appointed to the National Planning Commission (NPC) by  President [[Jacob Zuma]] on 30 April 2010.&lt;ref name="Who" /&gt;

His resignation from Eskom came amidst a board room power struggle in the utility company between Godsell and CEO [[Jacob Maroga]]. Maroga was heavily criticised for power shortages, a record loss of R9,7 billion in the year to March 2009 and electricity price rises criticised for stoking inflation as South Africa battled recession. Maroga allegedly handed in his resignation, then denied doing so and Godsell, under political pressure from organistaions supporting Maoga, decided to hand in his resignation instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-11-09-bobby-godsell-resigns-from-eskom Bobby Godsell resigns from Eskom] ''[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]'' online, published: 9 November 2009, accessed: 8 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a_AciRQFPFrA Eskom Chairman Bobby Godsell Resigns, Government Says] bloomberg.com, published: 9 November 2009, accessed: 8 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Godsell, born to Cyril Harold &amp; Winnefred Godsell, is married to Gillian Hall. The couple has three daughters.&lt;ref name="Who" /&gt;

==Legacy==
Upon retirement, Bobby Godsell was described as "''a visionary, that has done much to shape the destiny of both the South African labour relations landscape and that of AngloGold Ashanti''" by then-chairman of AngloGold Ashanti, [[Russell Edey]].&lt;ref name="Annualseven" /&gt;

Under Godsell, AngloGold Ashanti had [[Hedge (finance)|hedged]] 11.3 million ounces of gold, as of early 2008, twice the value of the company's annual production. Under his successor, Mark Cutifani, this was gradually reduced to 3.22 million. In October 2010, this remaining amount was paid off with US$2.63 billion, or US$1,300 per ounce of gold. The hedging of gold at low prices while the overall-gold price reached record heights in 2010 was financially very unfavourable for AngloGold Ashanti, forcing the company to sell gold at prices far below spot market value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglogoldashanti.com/Additional/Press/2010/20101007+AngloGold+Ashanti+eliminates+hedge+book.htm AngloGold Ashanti eliminates hedge book, gains full exposure to gold] AGA website, published: 7 October 2010, accessed: 8 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Bobby Godsell and his then-marketing director Kelvin Williams found themselves blamed for the excessive hedging of the company, brought on in parts by the AngloGold-Ashanti merger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://piedmontmining.com/market_news.php?action=dmView&amp;NewsId=39 AngloGold Stumbles Over Gold Hedges] piedmontmining.com, published: 24 May 2009, accessed: 8 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=553&amp;fArticleId=5659578 AngloGold closes off its disastrous hedge book] busrep.co.za, published: 23 September 2010, accessed: 8 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Godsell's final years as CEO, AngloGold Ashanti experienced a high number of fatalities in its mines, 37 in 2006 and 34 in 2007. Under his successor, these numbers dropped to 14 in 2008 and 16 in 2009, achieved partly through new safety initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-business/anglogold-wants-zero-mine-deaths-by-2015-20100329-r7i2.html AngloGold wants zero mine deaths by 2015] ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', published: 29 March 2010, accessed: 9 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKL0348674220070803 New AngloGold Ashanti CEO to tackle mine deaths] uk.reuters.com, published: 3 August 2007, accessed: 8 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Godsell is highly regarded and trusted by the [[National Union of Mineworkers (South Africa)|National Union of Mineworkers]], who came out in his defence after he lost the power struggle within Eskom and was accused of racism, as did the [[African National Congress]], the ANC. His positive relationship with the unions dates back to 1974, when he became labour relations expert and got involved in forming Anglo American's employment practice policies. His role in getting white business in South Africa to accept both the unpopular Labour Relations Act and, later, the mining charter in the transformation period of the country was instrumental and his relationship with [[Cyril Ramaphosa]] was crucial in all this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grubstreet.co.za/2009/11/who-is-bobby-godsell-the-big-cheese-whom-the-workers-support/ Who is Bobby Godsell, the big cheese whom the workers support?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118134646/http://grubstreet.co.za/2009/11/who-is-bobby-godsell-the-big-cheese-whom-the-workers-support/ |date=18 November 2009 }} grubstreet.co.za, published: 11 November 2009, accessed: 8 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

W. Norton &amp; Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Boomerang-Travels-New-Third-World/dp/0393081818/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1393416951&amp;sr=1-1|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|title=Boomerang: Travels in the New Third World Hardcover by Michael Lewis|accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
The text focuses on the themes discussed in his previous book, ''[[The Big Short]]'', and is based on the articles that Lewis wrote for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/27/books/boomerang-by-michael-lewis-review.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|publisher=[[nytimes.com]]|title=Touring the Ruins of the Old Economy|first=Michiko|last=Kakutani|date=September 26, 2011 |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{quote|In his new book on the seemingly permanent financial crisis, Boomerang: Travels in the New Third World, Lewis shows again why he is the leading journalist of his generation. He writes about important matters — the most important matters — and he writes about them so amusingly that he can permanently change your point of view, even of things you already had a settled opinion about. Who sees baseball the same way after his Moneyball? Football announcers seldom talked about the immense importance of the left tackle before The Blind Side.

And, thanks to “Boomerang,” a collection of financial-disaster reports from Iceland, Ireland, Greece, Germany and California, few will be able to think of Germans without recalling what Lewis memorably describes as a national obsession with excrement. In typical Lewis fashion, a bodily aperture becomes a lens for seeing Germany’s role in the global debt calamity.}}

—Review by ''[[Forbes]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kylesmith/2011/09/28/book-review-boomerang-by-michael-lewis/|title=Book Review: Boomerang, By Michael Lewis|publisher=[[forbes.com]]|accessdate=2015-02-28|first=Kyle|last=Smith|date=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Michael Lewis possesses the rare storyteller’s ability to make virtually any subject both lucid and compelling. In his new book, “Boomerang,” he actually makes topics like European sovereign debt, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank not only comprehensible but also fascinating — even, or especially, to readers who rarely open the business pages or watch CNBC. The book could not be more timely given the worries about Europe’s deepening debt crisis and the recent warning issued by Christine Lagarde, managing director of the I.M.F, that “the current economic situation is entering a dangerous phase.”}}

[[Graf|Count]] '''Carl Robert Mannerheim''' (1835&amp;ndash;1914) was a Finnish aristocrat and businessman. 
He was the son of naturalist [[Carl Gustaf Mannerheim (naturalist)|Carl Gustaf Mannerheim]], and father of Marshal [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]].

Mannerheim wrote the satirical play ''Ditt och datt'' when he was a student at Helsinki, in 1858, which caused a political scandal ending in his expulsion and the university rector's resignation. 

Mannerheim owned [[Louhisaari Manor]] in [[Askainen]], [[Turku and Pori Province]], inherited from his father. He married Hedvig Charlotta Helena von Julin (d. 1881, daughter of wealthy industrialist Johan Jacob von Julin), with whom he had seven children.

He was a founding member of the [[Kuusankoski]] paper mill, acting as the company's director from 1872 to 1878.
He was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1879, and in 1880 Louhisaari estate was transferred to his sister Mimmi (Eva Carolina).
Mannerheim thereupon eloped to Paris with his mistress, baroness Sofia Nordenstam (d. 1914), where he led a bohemian lifestyle. Meanwhile, his seven children were in the custody of family members after the death of his wife in 1881. Mannerheim married   Sofia Nordenstam  in 1883, and the couple returned to  Finland, where Mannerheim  founded an office supplies company in Helsinki in 1887.
Named ''Systema Oy Ab'' in 1909, the company went on to become Finland's leading importer of [[typewriter]]s.

Mannerheim was also active as a writer and translator, known for his [[Radicalism (historical)|radical liberal]] opinions. He became active in the movement resisting the [[Russification of Finland]], and he tried to dissuade his son, who served in the Russian Imperial Army, from joining the [[Russo-Japanese War]].

== History ==
Originally named the Midwest Center for Labor Research, CLCR was founded in 1982 in order to examine the causes and effects of the sharp decline in manufacturing in the 1970s. The goal of CLCR's early research was to determine whether this rapid [[deindustrialization]] in the United States was an inevitable consequence of globalization and [[Technology|technological development]] or whether it was a trend that could be slowed or reversed by effective policy changes.

After almost two decades of in-depth research, CLCR concluded that 80% of losses in manufacturing could have been averted, avoiding much of the subsequent rise in poverty across manufacturing-dependent communities.

In [[employment law]], '''constructive dismissal''', also called '''constructive discharge''' or '''constructive termination''', occurs when an [[employee]] [[resign]]s as a result of the [[employer]] creating a [[hostile work environment]]. Since the resignation was not truly voluntary, it is, in effect, a termination. For example, when an employer places extraordinary and unreasonable work demands on an employee to obtain their resignation, this can constitute a constructive dismissal.

The exact legal consequences differ between different countries, but generally a constructive dismissal leads to the employee's obligations ending and the employee acquiring the right to make claims against the employer.

The employee may resign over a single serious incident or over a pattern of incidents. Generally, a party seeking relief must have resigned soon after one of the constructive acts.

==United States law==
In the United States, constructive discharge is a general term describing the involuntary resignation of an employee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dol.gov/elaws/eta/warn/glossaryall.asp#Constructive_Discharge&lt;/ref&gt; There is no single federal or state law against constructive dismissal in general. From a legal standpoint, it occurs when an employee is forced to resign because of intolerable working conditions which violate employment legislation, such as:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wrongfulterminationsettlements.com/reasons/constructive-discharge/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA)
* Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA)
* Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)
* Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA)
* Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA)
* Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII)
* Any state employment law

The burden of proof in constructive dismissal cases lies with the employee.

The [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] has provided a 3-part test to determine whether or not a constructive discharge has occurred: (1) a reasonable person in the complainant’s position would have found the working conditions intolerable; (2) conduct that constituted discrimination against the complainant created the intolerable working conditions; and (3) the complainant’s involuntary resignation resulted from the intolerable working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;https://federalemployeelawblog.com/2017/07/10/constructive-discharge-for-federal-employees/&lt;/ref&gt;  

In California, the California Supreme Court defines constructive discharge as follows:

"In order to establish a constructive discharge, an employee must plead and prove, by the usual preponderance of the evidence standard, that the employer either intentionally created or knowingly permitted working conditions that were so intolerable or aggravated at the time of the employee's resignation that a reasonable employer would realize that a reasonable person in the employee's position would be compelled to resign."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=turner+anheuser+bush&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5&amp;case=10157690807936007266&amp;scilh=0 ''Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc.''], 7 Cal. 4th 1238, 1251, 876 P.2d 1022 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian law==

Canadian courts recognize there are circumstances in which the employer, although not acting explicitly to terminate an individual’s employment, alters the employment relationship’s terms and conditions to such a degree that an employee is entitled to regard the employer’s conduct as a termination, and claim [[wrongful dismissal]], just as if they had been let go without any notice or termination pay in lieu of notice.&lt;ref name="duttonlaw.ca"&gt;http://duttonlaw.ca/constructive-dismissal/&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructive dismissal arises from the failure of the employer to live up to the essential obligations of the employment relationship, regardless of whether the employee signed a written employment contract. Employment law implies into employment relationships a common-law set of terms and conditions applicable to all employees. For example, once agreed upon, wages are implicitly locked in by the common-law of contract as an essential term of the employment relationship. In this regard, it is a constructive dismissal if an employer fails to pay an employee.

An employer’s breach of the employment contract releases the employee from their obligation to perform under the contract, and thus treat themselves as dismissed. Hence, a constructive dismissal always becomes a wrongful dismissal.

===Changes to the employment relationship===

Typically, the first way to claim constructive dismissal involves an employer making substantial changes to the employment contract, such as:

# a demotion;
# altering the employee’s reporting structure, job description or working conditions;
# lowering an employee’s compensation;
# changing hours of work;
# imposing a suspension or leave of absence; and
# relocating the employee’s workplace.

In addition, failure on the part of an employer to provide employment standards (i.e. overtime pay, vacation pay, etc.), can result in a constructive dismissal.

Nevertheless, for an employee to have a successful case for constructive dismissal, the employer’s breach must be fundamental. What is “fundamental” depends on the circumstances, and not all changes to the employment relationship give rise to a constructive dismissal. For example, administrative, i.e. non-disciplinary, suspensions might not amount to a constructive dismissal if imposed in good faith and justified by legitimate business reasons (i.e. lack of work). As well, a small reduction in salary, in tough times, and administered rationally, might not be a constructive dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;http://duttonlaw.ca/constructive-dismissal-employees/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toxic work environments===

An employee may also be able to claim a constructive dismissal based on an employer’s conduct, rather than a change to a specific or implied term of the employment contract. Here, the second way to claim constructive dismissal examines whether the employer’s (or employee of the employer) course of conduct, or even a single incident, demonstrates an intention to no longer be bound by the written or implied employment contract. An example of this kind of constructive dismissal is a “toxic work environment”. In this regard, if a work environment is so poisoned that a reasonable person wouldn’t be expected to return, then constructive dismissal is likely.

A toxic work environment is classically defined as  unjustified criticism as well as vague and unfounded accusations of poor performance, especially where authority and respect with co-workers had been seriously undermined and compromised. Another example of toxic work environment is where the employer fails to prevent workplace harassment.&lt;ref name="duttonlaw.ca"/&gt;

==UK law==

In [[United Kingdom]] law, constructive dismissal is defined by the [[Employment Rights Act 1996]] section 95(1)c:&lt;ref name=era96-95&gt;{{UK-LEG
|path=ukpga/1996/18/section/95
|title=Section 95(1)c of the [[Employment Rights Act 1996]]
|noprefix=yes
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bq|The employee terminates the contract under which they are employed (with or without notice) in circumstances in which they are entitled to terminate it without notice by reason of the employer's conduct.}} The circumstances in which an employee is entitled are defined in common law. The notion of constructive dismissal most often arises from a fundamental breach of the term of trust and confidence implied in all [[contract of employment|contracts of employment]]. In order to avoid such a breach ''"[a]n employer must not, without reasonable or proper cause, conduct himself in a manner calculated or likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of trust and confidence between the employer and the employee."''&lt;ref name=Malik&gt;''[[Malik and Mahmud v Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA|Malik &amp; anor v Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA]]'' 1997] UKHL 23; [1998] AC 20&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst a breach can be of the implied term of trust and confidence, a fundamental breach of any of the express or implied terms of a contract of employment is sufficient.

The [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] states:

{{bq|A [[tribunal]] may rule that an employee who resigns because of conduct by his or her employer has been 'constructively dismissed'. For a tribunal to rule in this way the employer's action has to be such that it can be regarded as a significant breach of the employment contract indicating that he or she intends no longer to be bound by one or more terms of the contract: an example of this might be where the employer arbitrarily demotes an employee to a lower rank or poorer paid position. The contract is what has been agreed between the parties, whether orally or in writing, or a combination of both, together with what must necessarily be implied to make the contract workable.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.berr.gov.uk/employment/employment-legislation/employment-guidance/page31082.html#Constructive_dismissal&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following a constructive dismissal, claim for "[[unfair dismissal]]" and a claim for "[[wrongful dismissal]]" may arise.

===Types of constructive dismissal===

Although they tend to blend into one in a tribunal, strictly there are two types of constructive dismissal: statutory and common law.

At common law&lt;ref&gt;''Western Excavating (ECC) Ltd v Sharp'' [1978] ICR 221&lt;/ref&gt; the requirement is acceptance of a repudiatory breach, which means the employer has indicated it no longer considers itself bound by an essential term of the contract, e.g. the requirement to pay wages or the requirement not to destroy the mutual bond of trust and confidence. It matters not if the employer did not mean to repudiate the contract.&lt;ref name=lewis&gt;''Lewis v Motorworld Garages Ltd'' [1986] ICR 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Under statute&lt;ref name=era96-95/&gt; the requirement is employer's "conduct" allowing the employee to "terminate without notice"; as this can only happen with a repudiatory breach it amounts to the same thing.

===Relation to unfair dismissal===
A common mistake is to assume that constructive dismissal is exactly the same as unfair treatment of an employee – it can sometimes be that treatment that can be considered generally evenhanded nevertheless makes life so difficult that the employee is in essence forced to resign&lt;ref&gt;''Savoia v Chiltern Herb Farms Ltd'' [1982] IRLR 166&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., a fair constructive dismissal might be a unilateral change of contract justified by a bigger benefit to the business than the inconvenience to the employee), but the Employment Appeal Tribunal doubts that it will be very often that the employer can breach ERA96 s98(4) whilst being fair.

A constructive dismissal occurs when the employer's serious breach causes&lt;ref&gt;''British Leyland UK Ltd v McQuilken'' [1978] IRLR 245&lt;/ref&gt; the employee to accept that the contract has been terminated, by resigning. The fairness of it would have to be looked at separately under a statutory claim for unfair dismissal.

The problems for the employer are that constructive dismissal is a contractual claim, which can be made in a tribunal for up to £25,000 or in court without limit, and, by dismissing constructively, it by definition misses out on the correct procedure meaning that even if the reason was fair, the decision was probably not, and so an unfair dismissal usually arises, creating a statutory claim alongside the contractual claim.

The court can look behind the lack of, or different, stated reason given by the employee at the time of resignation to establish that a cover story was in fact a resignation caused by fundamental breach.&lt;ref&gt;''Weathersfield Ltd v Sargent'' [1999] ICR 425&lt;/ref&gt;

===Typical causes===
The person causing the dismissal does not need the authority to dismiss, as long as they acted in the course of employment.&lt;ref name=era96-95/&gt;&lt;ref name=hilton&gt;''Hilton International Hotels (UK) Ltd v Protopapa'' [1990] IRLR 316&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grounds====
Constructive dismissal is typically caused by:-

*unilateral contract changes by the employer such as:
** deliberate&lt;ref&gt;''Cantor Fitzgerald International v Callaghan'' [1999] ICR 639&lt;/ref&gt; cuts in pay or status (even temporary&lt;ref&gt;''Wadham Stringer Commercials (London) Ltd and Wadham Stringer Vehicles Ltd v Brown'' [1983] IRLR 46&lt;/ref&gt;),
** persistent delayed wages,
** refusal of holiday,&lt;ref&gt;''Lytlarch Ltd v Reid'' [1991] ICR 216&lt;/ref&gt;
** withdrawal of car,&lt;ref&gt;''Triton Oliver (Special Products) Ltd v Bromage'' (EAT 709/91) IDS Brief 511&lt;/ref&gt;
** suspension without pay (or even on full pay&lt;ref&gt;''William Hill Organisation Ltd v Tucker'' [1999] ICR 291&lt;/ref&gt;),
** dramatic changes to duties, hours&lt;ref&gt;''Greenaway Harrison Ltd v Wiles'' [1994] IRLR 380&lt;/ref&gt; or location (beyond reasonable daily travelling distance&lt;ref&gt;''Courtaulds Northern Spinning Ltd v Sibson'' [1988] ICR 451&lt;/ref&gt;), or
* breach of contract in the form of bullying, e.g.:
** ignoring complaints,&lt;ref&gt;''Goolds v McConnell'' [1995] IRLR 516&lt;/ref&gt;
** persistent unwanted amorous advances,&lt;ref&gt;''Western Excavating (ECC) Ltd v Sharp''&lt;/ref&gt;
** bullying and swearing,&lt;ref&gt;''Korkaluk v Cantor Fitzgerald International'' [2004] ICR 697&lt;/ref&gt;
** verbal abuse (typically referring to gender,&lt;ref&gt;''Isle of Wight Tourist Board v Coombes'' [1976] IRLR 413&lt;/ref&gt; size&lt;ref&gt;''Palmanor v Cedron'' [1978] IRLR 303&lt;/ref&gt; or incompetence&lt;ref name=courtaulds&gt;''Courtaulds Northern Textiles Ltd v Andrew'' [1979] IRLR 84, EAT&lt;/ref&gt;),
** singling out for no pay rise,&lt;ref&gt;''Gardner v Beresford'' [1978] IRLR 63&lt;/ref&gt;
** criticising in front of subordinates,&lt;ref name=hilton/&gt;
** lack of support (e.g. forcing to do two peoples' jobs),&lt;ref&gt;''Seligman v McHugh'' [1979] IRLR 316&lt;/ref&gt;
** failure to notify a woman on maternity leave of a vacancy which she would have applied for if she had been made aware of it,&lt;ref&gt;''Visa International Service Association Ltd v Paul'' [2004] IRLR 42&lt;/ref&gt;
** refusal to confirm continuity on TUPE transfer,&lt;ref&gt;''Euro-Die (UK) Ltd v Skidmore'' (EAT 1158/98) (2000) IDS Brief B665/14&lt;/ref&gt;
** revealing secret complaints in a reference (even ones required by a regulator&lt;ref&gt;''TSB Bank plc v Harris'' [2000] IRLR 157&lt;/ref&gt;), or
*breaches such as:
** behaviour which is arbitrary, capricious, inequitable, intolerable or outside good industrial practice,&lt;ref&gt;''Woods v WM Car Services (Peterborough) Ltd'' [1981] ICR 666&lt;/ref&gt;
** conduct that undermined trust and confidence (i.e. offering an incentive to resign to avoid performance managing capability),&lt;ref&gt;''Billington v Michael Hunter &amp; Sons Ltd'' EAT 0578/03, IDS Brief 758&lt;/ref&gt;
** refusal to look for an alternative role due to workplace stress,&lt;ref&gt;''Thanet District Council v Websper'' EAT 1090/01, IDS Brief 728&lt;/ref&gt;
** disproportionate disciplinary penalty,&lt;ref&gt;''Stanley Cole (Wainfleet) Ltd v Sheridan'' [2003] ICR 297&lt;/ref&gt;
** employer cons employee into resigning.&lt;ref&gt;''Caledonian Mining Co Ltd v Bassett'' [1990] ICR 425&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Flexibility and mobility clauses=====
A flexibility clause does not allow the employer to change a type of job&lt;ref&gt;''Land Securities Trillium Ltd v Thornley'' [2005] IRLR 765&lt;/ref&gt; as it is implied that the flexibility is to operate within the original job.

A mobility clause is subject to the implied term of mutual trust which prevents the employer from sending an employee to the other side of the country without adequate notice or from doing anything which makes it impossible for the employee to keep his side of the bargain.&lt;ref&gt;''United Bank Ltd v Akhtar'' [1989] IRLR 507&lt;/ref&gt;

====Insufficient grounds====
There is no right to automatic pay rises.&lt;ref&gt;''Murco Petroleum Ltd v Forge'' [1987] ICR 282&lt;/ref&gt; Nor is a smoking ban a breach.&lt;ref&gt;''Dryden v Greater Glasgow Health Board'' [1992] IRLR 469&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compensation===
The employee's conduct is irrelevant to liability, although it can affect quantum; in other words it cannot get the employer off the hook, but could reduce compensation if he helped bring about his own downfall.

===Timing===
The conduct by the employer could be:

* a one-off serious breach of contract,
* anything to the employee's detriment (not necessarily a breach of contract) that acts as a last straw&lt;ref name=logan&gt;''Logan v Commissioners of Custom and Excise'' [2004] IRLR 63&lt;/ref&gt; after a string of serious breaches,&lt;ref&gt;''Abbey National plc v Robinson'' [2001] IDS Brief 680&lt;/ref&gt;
* a serious breach that acts as the last straw after a string of less serious breaches,&lt;ref&gt;''JV Strong &amp; Co Ltd v Hamill'' [2001] IDS Brief 684&lt;/ref&gt; or
* a string of less serious breaches related in time and nature that add up to a serious breach (random mistakes over the years are not enough – it would be more like a sustained campaign to undermine).

===Employee must resign quickly===
The employee has to resign within a reasonable time of the trigger, which is the one-off outrage or the last straw. The employee could work under protest while he or she finds a new job.&lt;ref&gt;''Jones v F Sirl &amp; Son (Furnishers) Ltd'' [1997] IRLR 493&lt;/ref&gt;

====Waiver====

If the employer alleges that the employee waived a breach by not resigning, each breach needs to be looked at to see if it was waived separately,&lt;ref name=logan/&gt; but even if a breach was waived, the last straw revives it for the purpose of determining whether overall there was a repudiation.&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;

====Affirmation====

If the employer alleges that the employee has affirmed a breach by not resigning, the employee could point out that no consideration was paid for it and so no contract change has been accepted. Acceptance of a replacement job would prove affirmation.&lt;ref&gt;''Bunning v GT Bunning &amp; Sons Ltd'' [2005] EWCA Civ 983&lt;/ref&gt;

An employee who stays on for a year after refusing to sign a new contract does not necessarily accept it.&lt;ref&gt;''Aparau v Iceland Frozen Foods plc'' [1996] IRLR 119&lt;/ref&gt;

====Last straw====

The last straw does not have to be similar to the earlier string of events or even unreasonable or blameworthy – it need only be related to the obligation of trust and confidence and enough that when added to the earlier events the totality is a repudiation.&lt;ref&gt;''Omilaju v Waltham Forest London Borough Council'' [2005] ICR 481&lt;/ref&gt;

====Notice period====

Although the employer's breach must be serious enough to entitle the employee to resign without notice, the employee is entitled to give notice if they prefer, so that they could enjoy the benefit of wages during the notice period.

To prevent the employer alleging that the resignation was caused by a job offer, the employee should resign first and then seek a new job during the notice period.

During the notice period, the employer could make the employee redundant&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG
|path=ukpga/1996/18/section/139
|title=Section 139(1) of the [[Employment Rights Act 1996]]
|noprefix=yes
}}&lt;/ref&gt; or summarily dismiss them, if it has the grounds to do so fairly.  Otherwise, the reason for termination will be resignation and not dismissal, since the employee cannot serve a counternotice.&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG

'''Frederick Walter Scott Craig''' (10 December 1929 – 23 March 1989) was a Scottish [[psephology|psephologist]] and compiler of the standard reference books covering United Kingdom Parliamentary election results. He originally worked in [[public relations]], compiling election results in his spare time which were published by the [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Scottish Unionist Party]]. In the late 1960s he launched his own business as a publisher of reference books, and also compiled various other statistics concerning British politics.

Craig also had a political career of his own, initially as an [[election agent]] and then as a candidate. Efforts to get elected in his native [[Glasgow]] being unsuccessful, after he moved to [[Chichester]] in 1970 he was first elected to the [[Chichester District|District Council]] and later to [[West Sussex]] County Council. However he fell out with a faction in the local [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and launched a rebel group which led to his expulsion. Late in his life he suffered severe depression and he committed suicide at the age of 59.

== Early life ==
Craig was a native of [[Glasgow]]. He became interested in election statistics while still at school.&lt;ref&gt;"He totes up the voting" ('Talk of the Times'), ''Glasgow Evening Times'', 27 June 1961, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He was active in the [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Scottish Unionist Party]] Association, and in 1954 began to contribute the 'Scottish Parliamentary Election Manual' of election results to the ''Yearbook for Scotland'', which the party published.&lt;ref name="Reference Book" /&gt; Craig was unhappy with existing sources for election statistics and undertook research himself to correct the vote figures and discover the source of independent candidates, and his election manual became highly respected.

== Political activity ==
As a paid agent for the Unionist Party, Craig was the election agent for [[Sir James Hutchison, 1st Baronet|James Hutchison]] in [[Glasgow Scotstoun (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Scotstoun]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1955|1955 general election]] and for the [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Unionist]] parliamentary candidate in [[Rutherglen (UK Parliament constituency)|Rutherglen]] in 1964. He twice fought for election to the [[Politics of Glasgow|Glasgow City Corporation]] in the mid-1960s. His first attempt was in May 1966 when he came forward as an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] Conservative candidate against the 'Progressive Party', a local alliance between Conservatives and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] which controlled the council, in [[Kelvinside]] ward. Craig offered to withdraw if the Progressive councillor would repudiate that party's policy on council house rents, and to sit as a Conservative if the party split up; the offer was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;"Lord Provost Appeals for High Poll Today", ''Glasgow Herald'', 3 May 1966, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1967 Craig was selected as official Conservative candidate for [[Gorbals]] ward in a byelection;&lt;ref&gt;"50-50 as City Tories get set for Elections", ''Glasgow Evening Times'', 5 September 1967, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; he was one of seven candidates and attempted to stand out by distributing on the eve of poll 5,000 'wage packets' containing an appeal to vote for him.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Skilling, "Tory's 'pay packet' plea to voters in Gorbals", ''Glasgow Evening Times'', 23 October 1967, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; However Craig came third in the poll.&lt;ref&gt;"Labour hold Gorbals", ''Glasgow Evening Times'', 25 October 1967, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reference books ==
His research into elections continued and widened from Scotland to the whole of the United Kingdom, and he compiled a card index to all elections from 1918 onwards. In 1966 he had completed a manuscript of a reference book on statistics about elections since 1918, which was intended to be published in two volumes of 700 pages each to be part-funded by the Institute of Electoral Research; the calling of a [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|general election]] annoyed him because he would have to add the statistics from it to the book.&lt;ref name="Reference Book"&gt;Vincent Donnelly, "Reference Book", ''Glasgow Evening Times'', 28 February 1966, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Craig took a decisive step in 1968 when he was paid off from his public relations job and set up Political Reference Publications, to publish his work.&lt;ref name="Family"&gt;William Hunter, "Cottage industry based on the work of the 'House'", ''Glasgow Herald'', 27 November 1969, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The first book to be published was ''British Parliamentary Election Statistics 1918–1966'' which summarised the results of every general election as well as giving a wealth of other information. Critical reception was very positive and Craig always considered it his favourite book. It has continued to be updated, under the title ''British Electoral Facts''.

His series of ''British Parliamentary Election Results'' began to appear the next year with the volume for 1918–1949. The series has been completed to run from the [[Reform Act]] of 1832 to date. Craig also started the ''Political Companion'', a quarterly update, which ran from 1969 to 1983. His work was a family affair with his wife Phyllis helping with the production and administration, and his daughters undertaking the proofreading.&lt;ref name="Family" /&gt; Craig pioneered the use of technology and put the source data onto computer readable tape; the distinctive clear layout of his books was a result of his use of early computer [[typesetting]].

== Expanding company ==
In 1970 he moved from [[Anniesland Cross]] in Glasgow to [[Chichester]] in West Sussex and established another company, Parliamentary Research Services, which eventually took over all his activities. His public relations background led to new lines of business including compilation of activities of members of parliament from votes in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;"MPs go aground on data bank", ''The Times'', 8 November 1971, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of the [[BBC]] team, albeit behind the camera, on their programme covering the 1970 general election; in 1972 he was asked to help by both the BBC and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], and decided to transfer to commercial television.&lt;ref&gt;"The Times Diary", ''The Times'', 7 February 1972, p. 12. He is one of two named 'Political Consultants' to ITN in the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|second 1974 election]] on the back cover of "The ITN Election Handbook", compiled by Robert Hargreaves with Paul McKee (View No. 1, Independent Television Publications Ltd, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 he was elected to [[Chichester District Council]], but with the pressure of work caused by the two elections of 1974 he resigned his seat. When the candidate selected to replace him dropped out, Craig found that his busy period was over and was himself nominated to fight the by-election caused by his own resignation.&lt;ref&gt;"Comeback", ''The Times'', 26 November 1974, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig was a leading member of Chichester Concern, a group set up to oppose a pedestrianisation precinct in the centre of the city. He arranged for John Tyme, a lecturer in Environmental Studies at [[Sheffield Hallam University|Sheffield Polytechnic]] who had made a name opposing motorway schemes, to come to a public inquiry and oppose it. Tyme was unable to persuade the inquiry to adjourn and consider alternatives, and had to return home.&lt;ref&gt;Nikki Knewstub, "I expect wigging, says beaten Tyme", ''The Guardian'', 29 September 1976, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opinions ===
In 1975 Craig criticised the extension of [[postal votes]] to people on holiday at the time of elections, arguing that there were "very real dangers in any electoral system which permits extensive voting by post". He thought it absurd to increase postal voting facilities which might lead to widespread abuse because there were many ways of committing electoral fraud.&lt;ref&gt;"Market vote: Where no X marks the spot" (letters), ''The Guardian'', 23 April 1975, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig used the prefaces and forewords of his books to express opinions on the electoral system, arguing in 1977 that the increasing numbers of fringe and frivolous candidates in Parliamentary elections made it necessary to raise the level of the deposit required for a nomination to be valid.&lt;ref&gt;"Higher deposit urged for poll candidates", ''The Times'', 22 September 1977, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticised the ability of people with holiday homes to register to vote in two constituencies, on the grounds that they could choose to vote in the most marginal. Craig pointed out that while it was illegal for dual registered voters to vote twice, the penalties were minimal and the offence difficult to detect.&lt;ref&gt;"Holiday home owners' voting law criticized", ''The Times'', 12 June 1980, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In "Chronology of British Parliamentary By-elections", Craig decried the "confusing and often misleading display of computer graphics" used on television election programmes, and also noted the decline in newspaper coverage of by-election campaigns by the broadsheet newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;"Chronology of British Parliamentary By-elections 1833–1987", Parliamentary Research Services, Chichester, 1987, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Home Affairs Select Committee]] conducted an inquiry into the Representation of the People Acts, Craig (through his company) submitted a memorandum calling for an increased deposit, prohibition of multiple registration, and prevention of candidates changing their names to ones similar to those of other candidates. He also pressed for Returning Officers to be compelled to send the official result of every Parliamentary election to the Clerk of the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;"Appendix 38: Memorandum submitted by the Parliamentary Research Services", "Representation of the People Act 1949", House of Commons Home Affairs Committee, Minutes of Evidence. HC 32-x 1982–83 p. 332-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservative split ==
At the West Sussex County Council election in 1981, Craig was elected as a Conservative councillor in Chichester West division, while his wife Phyllis won Chichester South division. He had been the Chairman of the Chichester City branch of [[Chichester (UK Parliament constituency)|Chichester]] Conservative Association for many years, but at a stormy meeting on 1 March 1982 he was voted out of office. When he spoke in support of his re-election, Craig had noted the presence of many unfamiliar faces and declared "I will oppose [[Wets and dries|wets]] and Left Wing infiltrators who would like to destroy this great party from within".&lt;ref&gt;"City Tories' ballot comes under fire", ''Chichester Observer'', 4 March 1982, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1981 the Association had adopted a new policy under which it refused to pay election expenses for sitting councillors, although new candidates would be funded. Craig and the other sitting councillors considered this amounted to deselection and formed the 'Association of Conservative Councillors' which would raise funds for their election expenses.&lt;ref&gt;"Breakaway councillors defy Tory ultimatum", ''Chichester Observer'', 20 January 1983, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association of Conservative Councillors chose Craig as its election agent and declared its intention to nominate candidates against those of the Conservative Association.&lt;ref&gt;"Tory councillors start new group", ''Chichester Observer'', 1 April 1982, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The resignation of a Liberal councillor led to a by-election for Chichester District Council in Chichester West ward in June 1982; Phyllis Craig was nominated in opposition to the official Conservative. The Liberal candidate held the seat with a majority of 149, with Phyllis Craig receiving 250 votes. It was widely perceived that her intervention had led to the Liberals winning a seat which otherwise would have been Conservative.&lt;ref&gt;"Battling Tories let Liberal in", ''Chichester Observer'', 8 July 1982, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Craig and his wife had their annual subscriptions returned by the Conservative Association in January 1983, which he denounced as "a back-door method of expulsion" and "a very nasty way of getting rid of someone."&lt;ref&gt;"Mayor expelled by Tory group in new flare-up", ''Chichester Observer'', 13 January 1983, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig and his wife stood as Independent Conservative candidates for Chichester District Council in the 1983 council elections,&lt;ref&gt;"Candidates for District Council", ''Chichester Observer'', 14 April 1983, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; but were not successful. He did not stand for re-election to the County Council in 1985 when his term ended. He later became a member of Chichester and Bognor Regis [[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]].&lt;ref name="Found dead"&gt;"Elections expert found dead", ''Chichester Observer'', 30 March 1989, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suicide ==
Fred and Phyllis Craig separated in January 1988, placing the future of his business in jeopardy. The news was considered so important that the [[House of Commons Library]] issued a note to alert journalists to it.&lt;ref&gt;"Back page", ''The Observer'', 31 January 1988, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Craig sold his publishing business to Dartmouth Publishing, which later became part of [[Ashgate Publishing]]; he retained editorial control.&lt;ref name="Found dead" /&gt; He could not come to terms with living on his own, and attempted suicide in 1988 by taking an overdose of pills;&lt;ref name="Suicide"&gt;"Election expert killed himself", ''Chichester Observer'', 11 May 1989, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; the dedication of "Britain Votes 4" written in May 1988 records his thanks to family and friends as well as medical staff.&lt;ref&gt;"Britain Votes 4", Parliamentary Research Services, Chichester, 1988, p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; However over the Easter holiday in 1989 he was found dead in his car having run a pipe from the exhaust. The cause of death was certified as [[Carbon monoxide poisoning]] and the Coroner returned a verdict of suicide as "from the circumstances and from the notes which have been left, I have no doubt he intended the result of what he did".&lt;ref name="Suicide" /&gt;

After his death, his papers were given to Professors [[Colin Rallings]] and [[Michael Thrasher]] of the [[University of Plymouth]].

'''Faras Hamdan''' ({{lang-ar|فارس حمدان}}; {{lang-he|פארס חמדאן}}, born 1910, died 29 November 1966) was an [[Israeli Arab]] politician who served as a member of the [[Knesset]] for [[Agriculture and Development]] between 1951 and 1959.

==Biography==
Hamdan was born in [[Baqa al-Gharbiyye]] during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman era]]. In 1944 he was elected head of local council of his village, where he later established a citrus confectionery factory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mk_eng.asp?mk_individual_id_t=420 Faras Hamdan: Public Activities] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Israeli legislative election, 1951|1951]] he was elected to the Knesset as head of the Agriculture and Development list, which was associated with the ruling [[Mapai]] party. The party joined [[David Ben-Gurion]]'s government, but Hamdan did not receive a ministerial portfolio.

He was re-elected in [[Israeli legislative election, 1955|1955]], and again joined the governing coalition. For the [[Israeli legislative election, 1959|1959 elections]] the party was headed by [[Mahmud A-Nashaf]]. It won only one seat and Hamdan lost his place in the Knesset.

He died in 1966.

[[File:J.Canetti 1960 Photo X.DR.jpg|thumb|Jacques Canetti at his desk in 1960|alt=]]
'''Nessim Jacques Canetti''' (30 May 1909, [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] – 7 June 1997, [[Suresnes]]) was a French [[music executive]] and a [[talent agent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rfimusique.com/siteen/biographie/biographie_6224.asp |title=RFI Musique -- LES FRERES JACQUES |publisher=[[Radio France Internationale]] Musique |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930035005/http://www.rfimusique.com/siteen/biographie/biographie_6224.asp |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Born into a Sephardic Jewish family, his parents were Jacques Elias (Elieser) and Matilda (née Arditti) Canetti.  He was the brother of the Nobel Prize-winning author [[Elias Canetti]] (1905-1994) and of Georges Canetti (1911-1971), a researcher and professor at the Pasteur Institute.  Canetti studied at the [[Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales]].

Canetti joined the Polydor record company in 1931.  There, he persuaded [[Marlene Dietrich]] to record her first album of French songs, and also worked on recordings of classical music by the Galimir Quartet.  He had developed a strong interest in jazz, and organised "Jazz Hot" tours of jazz artists to university towns, during the course of which he brought [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Cab Calloway]], and [[Duke Ellington]] to France.  In 1936, he became artistic director of the programme "Le Music-hall des jeunes" at ''Radio-Cité'', which began his long-term artistic involvement with French ''chanson''.&lt;ref name="Labesse"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1997/06/10/jacques-canetti-le-decouvreur-de-brassens-et-de-brel_3787006_1819218.html | title=Jacques Canetti, Le découvreur de Brassens et de Brel | work=Le Monde | author=Patrick Labesse | date=1997-06-10 | accessdate=2015-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, Canetti worked in [[Algiers]] for Radio-France Alger, and established a theatre with [[Françoise Rosay]] and Pierre Dac.  After World War II, he became artistic director at Polydor, and in 1947, he opened the ''Théâtre des Trois Baudets'' in the [[Quartier Pigalle|Pigalle]] district in Paris.  This venue hosted a great number of famous French performers, including Georges Brassens, [[Jacques Brel]], Guy Béart, [[Serge Gainsbourg]], Francis Lemarque, Félix Leclerc, and [[Juliette Greco]], and served as an artistic testing ground for potential recording artists of interest to Canetti.  He built up in parallel a catalogue of ''chanson'' recordings for the Philips label, in addition to work for Polydor, and also the Fontana label.

In 1963, Canetti left Philips and founded his own production company, ''Les productions Jacques Canetti'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.liberation.fr/culture/1997/06/09/canetti-mort-d-un-decouvreur-le-producteur-avait-lance-piaf-brassens-leclerc_207541 | title=Canetti, mort d'un découvreur. Le producteur avait lancé Piaf, Brassens, Leclerc | work=Libération | author=Hélène Hazera | date=1997-06-09 | accessdate=2015-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and record label, Disques Canetti, which featured such artists as [[Jeanne Moreau]], Jacques Higelin, [[Simone Signoret]], Serge Reggiani, and Boris Vian.&lt;ref name="Labesse"/&gt;  The ''Théâtre des Trois Baudets'' closed in 1967.  In 1978, Canetti published his memoir, ''On cherche jeune homme aimant la musique'', whose title derived from a job advertisement from Polydor which read "Cherche jeune homme aimant la musique et parlant couramment allemand" ("Seeking young man who loves music and speaks fluent German").

Canetti married Lucienne Vernay in 1947.  The couple had three children, Colette, Françoise and Bernard.

'''Ken Davy''' (born 1941) is an English businessman. He is the chairman of the [[rugby league]] club [[Huddersfield Giants]] and former chairman of  [[Premier League]] football club [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].

==Career==
Davy grew up in [[Filey]] on the East Coast of Yorkshire. He left school at 15 with no academic qualifications and worked as a photographer for [[P&amp;O Cruises|P&amp;O]]. At 21 he set up a commercial photography business in [[Huddersfield]] before joining [[Abbey Life]] in 1971. In 1979 he formed the independent financial advice company DBS, which he sold in June 2001, for £75&amp;nbsp;million. In 2003, he set up SimplyBiz, providing development, research and marketing services to financial advisers.

In 2011, he gave his views on the changes happening in the financial services industry "Restricted advice will prove much less attractive than many organisations believe. I can see why life insurers would be attracted to it, because it is a way of increasing their profits, but it does nothing for consumers or advisers."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moneymarketing.co.uk/mm-profile-ken-davy/ retrieved 27/05/2016&lt;/ref&gt; However, he later launched a national Restricted (rather than Independent) advice firm - ''Sandringham Partners'' in 2012, backed by £2m from SimplyBiz.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moneymarketing.co.uk/ken-davy-unveils-sandringham-financial-partners/  retrieved 27/05/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Huddersfield Giants==
In 1996, Davy took over as chairman of Huddersfield Giants rugby league club. In 1999, he merged Huddersfield Giants with [[Sheffield Eagles (1984)|Sheffield Eagles]], a move which resulted in the formation of the Huddersfield-Sheffield Giants. It was an unpopular move with supporters, and after one season the club reverted to being the Huddersfield Giants.

During Davy's chairmanship Huddersfield Giants played [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] in the [[2006 Challenge Cup|2006]] [[Challenge Cup]] Final at [[Twickenham Stadium]], [[London]]. It was the first time that the Giants had reached the final since 1962. Also during Davy's chairmanship, Giants won the League Leaders Shield for the first time in 81 years, after a 40-0 victory over [[Wakefield Trinity|Wakefield Trinity Wildcats]].

==Huddersfield Town==
Davy led the successful consortium, out of three interested, that took over Huddersfield Town in 2003, when they were in administration following the collapse of [[ITV Digital]] and Town's recent relegation to [[the Football League]]'s [[Football League Third Division|bottom tier]]. As part of the takeover Huddersfield Town's 40% share in the ground was transferred to a holding company, Huddersfield Sporting Pride Ltd. Huddersfield Sporting Pride Ltd holds a 60% stake in the Huddersfield ground with the combined original stakes of the football and rugby club, the other 40% stake is owned by Kirklees Council.

In September 2006, he was criticised for failing to offer Town a significant transfer budget for the [[2006-07 in English football|2006–07 season]] to enable the club to build on their play-off position of the previous season. The budget, which was unspecified, was (according to former manager [[Peter Jackson (footballer born 1961)|Peter Jackson]]) already used up on signing just two players, [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Matt Glennon]] and [[Striker (association football)|striker]] [[Luke Beckett]] despite the release of several players. However, Davy stated that Jackson was given the opportunity to strengthen his squad in order to mount a drive for promotion. This was not utilised and Jackson's "inability to attract key players" was one of the reasons given by Davy for the manager's dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/huddersfield_town/6422635.stm "Huddersfield sack manager Jackson"], [[BBC Sport]], 6 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

After Huddersfield's 2–3 loss to [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] on 16 September 2006, he addressed a peaceful demonstration of around 100 Town fans who had called for him to up the transfer budget or go, because of Town's poor start to the season in [[Football League One]], in which they only picked up nine points from the first nine games.

On 3 June 2009, he handed over the chairmanship to [[Dean Hoyle]] and, after a brief period of retaining a minority shareholding, relinquished all ownership in Huddersfield Town.&lt;ref name="TeamTalk"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130105062245/http://www.teamtalk.com/football/story/0,16368,1822_3406615,00.html "Hoyle to be Terriers chairman"], [[TEAMtalk]], retrieved 11 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Business Administration from the [[University of Huddersfield]] and an Honorary Fellowship of the [[Chartered Insurance Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.simplybizgroup.co.uk/about-us/ken-davy/ retrieved 27/05/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Law]] &amp; Management approach is a term defined by Antoine Masson and Hugh Bouthinon-Dumas, researchers at ESSEC, to refer to any research works focusing on Law as a key factor for companies success.&lt;ref name="RTDcom"&gt;A. Masson, H. Bouthinon-Dumas, L’approche Law and Management, ''RTD Com'', janvier /mars 2011, p. 233 à 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law &amp; Management approach, unlike the Economic Analysis of Law (also known as "Law and Economics") which primarily aims at assessing and comparing the cost and efficiency of the rules in accordance with criterium developed by Economists, seeks to explain the differences of performance between companies facing the same legal environment, according to their ability to take advantage from Law.

From a methods perspective, the Law &amp; Management approach focuses on the  behaviors of economic actors towards Law. The Law &amp; Management methods are therefore primarily behavioral and borrow numerous investigation and data processing techniques from the [[sociology]] or [[psychology]] fields since these approaches  rely on observation. The purpose of the Law &amp; Management is nevertheless specific and consistent with management sciences, as it try to understand how Law can be used by (and within) companies to achieve their assigned goals (that are mainly economic). The results of Law &amp; Management studies can be used to base recommendations that are addressed primarily not to normative or judicial authorities (as in the Law &amp; Economic) but to the economic actors.

Currently, the Law &amp; Management approach refers to the legal work of authors such as, in the United States, Constance Bagley ([[Yale School of Management]]),&lt;ref name="Winning Legally"&gt;, C. E. Bagley, Winning ''Legally: How to Use the Law to Create Value, Marshal Resources, and Manage Risk, Harvard Business School Press'', 2005, spec. pp. 47–50.&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert Bird ([[University of Connecticut]]),&lt;ref name="Pathways of Legal Strategy "&gt;, R. Bird, Pathways of Legal Strategy, ''14 STAN. J.L, BUS, &amp; FIN.'' (2008), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; George Siedel (Michigan Business School),&lt;ref name="Using Law for Competitive Advantage"&gt;, G. J. Siedel, ''Using Law for Competitive Advantage'', Jossey Bass, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  in [[Scandinavia]] (around the "proactive law” movement) Haapio Helena ([[University of Vaasa]]),&lt;ref name="Introduction to Praoactive Law "&gt;, H. Haapio, Introduction to Praoactive Law : A Business Lawyer's View, ''Scandinavian Studies in Law'', vol. 49, 2010, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; or in [[France]], Christophe Roquilly (EDHEC),&lt;ref name="Performance juridique et avantage concurrentiel "&gt;, Ch. Roquilly, « Performance juridique et avantage concurrentiel », LPA, 30 avril 2007, n° 86, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Christophe Collard (EDHEC),&lt;ref name="La performance juridique"&gt;, C. Collard, C. Roquilly, La performance juridique : pour une vision stratégique du droit dans l'entreprise, L.G.D.J., 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Antoine Masson (ESSEC) ou Hugues Bouthinon-Dumas (ESSEC).

'''''Lemonade Stand''''' is a [[business simulation game]] created in 1973 by Bob Jamison of the [[Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium]] (MECC). In it, the player moves through several rounds of running a [[lemonade stand]], beginning each round by making choices dependent on their current amount of money about their stock, prices, and advertising. In each round, the results are randomized based on the player's inputs, as well as affected by random events such as thunderstorms and street closures. Each round ends with a summary of the player's current status, and the game ends after 12 rounds.

In 1979, the game was [[porting|ported]] by Charlie Kellner to the [[Apple II]]; [[Apple (company)|Apple]] subsequently included the game with their computers throughout the 1980s. MECC also offered the game for sale as a part of bundles of children's software for Apple computers and [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 8-bit computers]]. Kellner's source code was released, and has since been ported to modern computers as a free, open-source game. Reviewers of the game, both contemporary and retroactive, viewed the game as a good primer for children into business and decision making processes.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Lemonade Stand 1.png|thumb|right|The decision making screen]]
The game simulates a child's lemonade stand, where choices made by the player regarding prices, advertising, etc. will determine the success or failure of the enterprise. The game owed its success to offering just enough variables to make a complex challenge for users, but still providing a simply-grasped introduction to running a business.&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lauppert"/&gt;

The player is first given a weather report for the day (sunny, cloudy, or hot and dry, each accompanied by a color drawing) and is  prompted for three values: the number of glasses of lemonade to make, the number of advertising signs, and the cost of lemonade per glass. The program then gives a report of the earnings for that day. A thunderstorm, sometimes occurring on cloudy days and accompanied by an animation, will void any profits and cause the player to lose any investment for the day. Other random events, such as street closures or the wind blowing away some signs, can also occur. The game ends after 12 rounds, or days. The game can be played either single-player or with up to 30 players (each player is independent and the sales of one do not affect another).&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=Six Business Management Games|url=https://archive.org/stream/creativecomputing-1982-04-a/Creative_Computing_v08_n04_1982_April#page/n29/mode/1up|format=jpg|magazine=[[Creative Computing]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|volume=8|number=4|date=April 1982 |pp=28, 30 |author=[[David H.

It also added color to the thunderstorm animation.

''Lemonade Stand'' was originally developed by Bob Jamison of the [[Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium]] in 1973 for time-shared mainframe computers.&lt;ref name="hotu"&gt;[http://www.hotud.org/component/content/article/46-simulation/22650 Lemonade Stand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514193640/http://www.hotud.org/component/content/article/46-simulation/22650 |date=2010-05-14 }} on [[Home of the Underdogs]]{{user-generated source|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/digital-life/how-tos/lemonade-stand-and-the-apple-revolution/2008/12/23/1229998532318.html Lemonade Stand and the Apple revolution] on [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] (December 24, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2016}} Charlie Kellner [[porting|ported]] the game to the [[Apple II]] platform in February 1979,{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} and Apple included it for free with their computers throughout the 1980s.&lt;ref name="lauppert"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130226024448/http://theodor.lauppert.ws/games/lemonade.htm Short history of Lemonade Stand], by Theodor Lauppert (archived){{self-published source|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Apple Tapes: Introductory Programs for the Apple II plus|url=https://archive.org/stream/The_Apple_Tapes_Introductory_Programs_for_the_Apple_II#page/n4 |publisher=Apple Computer Inc.|quote=manual original|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy ==
In 1982 [[David H. Ahl]] reviewed the game along with five other business management simulations in ''[[Creative Computing]]''; he indicated that it was simpler than most, and likely aimed at children, and said that it was a good teaching game for children about businesses. He also noted that it was free on Apple computers, and available for sale for the same system as part of a bundle of seven games for children for US$25 from MECC.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt; MECC also sold the game as part of a package for [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 8-bit computers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Instructional Computing Demonstration|url=https://archive.org/stream/APXInstructionalComputingDemonstration_201508/APX_Instructional_Computing_Demonstration#page/n33/mode/2up|format=jpg|publisher=[[Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium]] |author=[[Atari Program Exchange]] |data=|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Ghaffari, in ''Tapping the Wisdom that Surrounds You'', claimed that the game was "the perfect vehicle to introduce the [[microcomputer]] to family and friends and to convince them that technology could be a fun and positive force in their life."&lt;ref name="TW"/&gt;

Kellner's [[Applesoft BASIC]] [[source code]] has been available since 1979.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} The game was later [[Source port|ported]] to modern [[REALbasic]]&lt;ref name="codenautics" /&gt; and released as [[free and open-source software]] for many platforms like [[Windows]] and [[macOS]].&lt;ref name="codenautics"&gt;[http://codenautics.com/lemonade/ Lemonade Stand] on Codenautics "Lemonade Stand is both [[free and open-source]]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="github"&gt;{{cite web|work=LemonadeStand|publisher=GitHub|title=README.txt|url=https://github.com/jefftranter/6502/tree/master/basic/LemonadeStand|first=Jeff|last=Tranter}}{{user-generated source|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was published in Israel in Hebrew in the 1980s.

'''Martin Lumbye''' (born 1 January 1972 in Korea) is a Danish businessman internationally best known for his entrepreneurship and co-partnership in [[Momondo|momondo.com]] - a Copenhagen-based travel metasearch engine. After selling Momondo internationally he is now ceo of North-East Venture - an international venture capital fund based in Copenhagen.

== Family and early life ==
Martin Lumbye was born in 1972 in [[Korea]]. He arrived in Denmark in 1974 in the Danish city [[Horsens]] where Josephine and Hans Lumbye became his parents. There he grew up with a brother and a sister. After a couple of years they moved to the island of [[Als (island)|Als]]. In his late teens he moved to [[Aarhus]] to study HF-exam at [[Langkær Gymnasium &amp; HF]] followed by studying [[Humaniora]] at [[Aarhus University]]. He did't finalize his study, because the Danish theater, [[Dr. Dante]] gave him an interesting job-opening. He lives in Christianshavn in [[Copenhagen]] with his girlfriend Louise Linde Bertelsen, and he is the dad of three daughters.

== Early career ==
His early career began with studying Humaniora in Aarhus. A study that was interrupted and not finished while the Danish theater, Dr. Dante headhunted him back in 1997 to be head of public relations and marketing. Over the years he also momentarily took care of public relations and marketing for Granhøj Dans, Mammutteatret, Østre Gasværk, Copenhagen International Ballet and Mungo Park. This learned him the trade working with progressive people like Nikolaj Cederholm, Lars Kaalund and Palle Granhøj. Six years later, in 2003, he became Secretary-General in [[Aarhus Festuge]] - an art and culture festival in the city of Aarhus, Denmark. In 2006 Martin Lumbye resigned as Secretary-General after it was brought to light that [https://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/article4986741.ece Lumbye had cheated with his resume]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jyllands-posten.dk/protected/premium/aar/article4993713.ece|title=Skønbilledet krakelerer|last=|first=|date=May 2006|website=Jyllands-Posten|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/article4986741.ece|title=Festugechef smykker sig med lånte titler|last=|first=|date=26 May 2006|website=Jyllands-Posten|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jyllands-posten.dk/protected/premium/kultur/article3842993.ece|title=Festugechef: Jeg undskylder og beklager fejl|last=|first=|date=|website=Jyllands Posten|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Martin Lumbye claimed to have a bachelor degree in dramaturgy and several board positions, which he didn't&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Lumbye ascribed his resignation to personal reasons, while several sources at Aarhus Festuge attributed his resignation to internal turbulence and criticism from Lumbye's own staff&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

Moderna had made the strategic decision to disclose some of its approach in an effort to break the [[hype cycle]] into which it was getting locked.&lt;ref name=Science2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Servick|first1=Kelly|title=This mysterious $2 billion biotech is revealing the secrets behind its new drugs and vaccines|journal=Science|date=1 February 2017|doi=10.1126/science.aal0686|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/02/mysterious-2-billion-biotech-revealing-secrets-behind-its-new-drugs-and-vaccines|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Science'' piece disclosed that Moderna was delivering some of its mRNA therapeutic candidates in [[liposome]]s, that they were using modified [[uridine]] nucleosides based on work done by Katalin Karikó on avoiding immune responses to mRNA drugs, that the company was using mRNAs with modified sequences to improve folding and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] efficiency, and that their mRNA drug candidates were modified on each end, outside the coding region, to target them to specific cell types.&lt;ref name=Science2017/&gt;

'''Wam Entertainment'''  is a [[Lebanon]]-based [[Arab League|pan-Arab]] [[music industry|recorded music company]], [[production company]] and [[talent management|artist management]] company formed in 2007 by [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] musician and producer Walid Al Massih.

==History==
The company, which eventually evolved into Wam, was founded in 2007 as MGN Studios by Walid Al Massih and two partners through a joint venture. At the time, the company was based in a simple home studio that catered to miniature music productions.

In 2008, one of the partners decided to leave the company, and the company was officially renamed as Wam Entertainment. After many other problems with the third partner, Walid Al Massih was left to run the company alone. The company, now run wholly by Walid Al Massih, was expanded to enter the mainstream [[Middle East]]ern market through the creation of the company's first proper hit in [[Ragheb Alama]]'s hit song "Yighib". Walid Al Massih would go on to use his nightlife connections to produce music for some of the most well known artists in the region, such as Adam, Nawal el Zoghbi, Ayman Zbib, Ziad Borji, Maya Nehme, Myriam Atallah, Adam and Myriam Fares.

In 2009, the company entered the [[Music of the United Kingdom|English music]] market with projects for local [[metal music|Metal band]] Blaakyum, local [[pop music|Pop artist]] [[Belime]], and Iraqi international group [[UTN1]]. By 2010, the company had created a visible fan base and a powerful financial backing and the company expanded into [[Video production]].

The '''New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants''' (NZICA) was the operating name for the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand. The Institute represented over 33,000 members in New Zealand and overseas. Most accountants in New Zealand belonged to the Institute.

New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia (ICAA) amalgamated to become [[Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand]].

The Institute adopted the name ''Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand'' in 1996. Prior to that, it was known as the ''New Zealand Society of Accountants''.

In November 2013 Members of The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia and the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants voted yes on a proposal to create One New Institute: "Institute of Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.brw.com.au/p/professions/accountants_vote_yes_to_trans_tasman_IGAgmpm5z3ewYnh98mbJVM | title=Accountants vote yes to trans-Tasman Institute. Next stop: Asia | work=BRW | date=1 November 2013 | accessdate=12 December 2013 | author=Khadem, Nassim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

There are three "Colleges" or membership groupings within the Institute. New Zealand is unusual among the major CA Institutes worldwide in offering both ''Chartered Accountant'' and ''Associate Chartered Accountant'' designations.

===Chartered Accountants===
The [[Chartered Accountant]] designation denotes an accountant qualified to offer the full range of accountancy services privately and to the public. Members of the CA College term themselves ''Chartered Accountants'' and use the designatory letters '''CA'''.

===Associate Chartered Accountants===

Members of the ''Associate Chartered Accountant'' College use the designatory letters '''ACA'''.

The ''Associate Chartered Accountant'' designation is a mid-level qualification. Members of the ACA College must complete professional education requirements, but are not entitled to offer service to the public.

The designation ''Associate Chartered Accountant'' is not directly comparable to the ''Associate Chartered Accountant'' (ACA) designation offered by the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] and the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland]].

===Accounting Technicians===
NZICA includes among its members persons qualified at ''accounting technician'' level who belong to the College of Accounting Technicians and may use the designatory letters '''AT'''.

New Zealand's practice in this respect is not followed in other countries. For example, in the United Kingdom, accounting technicians generally belong to the [http://www.aat.org.uk Association of Accounting Technicians].

==Mutual recognition agreements==
The Institute has mutual recognition agreements with the following Institutes:

* [[Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants]]
* [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Australia]]
* [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]]
* [[Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants]]
* [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland]]
* [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland]]
* [[South African Institute of Chartered Accountants]]
* [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]]

NZICA members may admit to full memberships of the above institutions after passing an aptitude test or subject to other specific requirements. (As per regulations).

Membership of NZICA through a mutual recognition agreement is subject to meeting certain criteria, including knowledge of New Zealand tax and law.

Members of the following professional associations are given limited ''[[advanced standing]]'' by NZICA:

* [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]] (ACCA) Exemptions to ACCA have been removed altogether recently.
* [[CPA Australia]]
* [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of India]]

NZICA terminated mutual recognition agreements with [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]] and [[CPA Australia]] in 2003.

Members of the [http://www.aat.org.uk Association of Accounting Technicians] may obtain advanced standing for membership of the College of Accounting Technicians.

==Fellowship==
Fellowship, or senior membership, of NZICA may be awarded to a member of the CA College for service to the Institute, or high achievement in the profession.

==Public practice==
Members of the College of Chartered Accountants may apply for a ''Certificate of Public Practice''. Every member of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants who offers accounting services to the public must be a Chartered Accountant and hold a Certificate of Public Practice (CPP). The requirements for the issuing of this certificate are that (amongst others) a member must have had two years of acceptable practical experience while a member of the College of Chartered Accountants and have attended a course for new practitioners.

== History ==

===Accounting in New Zealand – Timeline===
*1894 – Incorporated Institute of Accountants of New Zealand
*1898 – New Zealand Accountants’ and Auditors’ Association [based in Auckland and had female members at the time of the formation of the Society in 1908. Early minutes are held in offsite storage. Auckland Branch have details.]
*1908 – New Zealand Society of Accountants Act (sponsored by both the above bodies). Established the Society with the purpose “to control and regulate the practice of the profession of accountancy in New Zealand”. Note that there is a copy of the Act in the Library's archive of Institute and Society publications.
**The new Act became law on 15 September of that year with Peter Barr, one of the earliest advocates of unity of the profession in New Zealand, as the society's first president. Note: the Bill was introduced by Premier, Sir [[Joseph Ward]], himself an accountant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/A/Accountancy/Accountancy/en Teara]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*1909 - First members admitted in 1909. Member no. 1 George Abercrombie.
**There is an entry for Peter Barr, the Society’s first president, in the [http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=3B12 Dictionary of NZ Biography]. Early in 1909, advertisements appeared in the national press inviting applications for admission to the Society for those with the qualifications set out in the Act.
**On 7 December the Board delivered a letter to the first meeting of the Council sitting in the Chamber of Commerce Hall. A copy of this letter is on p.&amp;nbsp;26 of Graham’s ‘First Fifty Years.’ 
*1910 – Had reached agreement with the University of New Zealand for the subjects on its education syllabus to be included in the new Bachelor of Commerce degree.
*1922 – Society establishes ''The Accountants Journal'' (TAJ).
*1933 – ''Companies Act'' 1933 restricts the appointment of company auditors to members of the Society.
**There was no regulation of corporate financial reporting by the Society prior to World War II. Reporting was largely open to individual interpretation as the Companies Acts of 1903, 1908 and 1933 imposed only “lightweight external regulation” (Keenan, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;97).
*1944 – New Zealand Institute of Cost Accountants founded. Affiliated with the NZSA in 1960; in 1966 it ceased to exist, with its activities being assumed by the NZSA.
*1946 – Council of the NZSA adopted seven of the ten recommendations on accounting principles issued by ICAEW. These were issued to members in a booklet titled Recommendations on Accounting Principles (NZSA, 1946).&lt;ref&gt;See Zeff (p.13) for a list of the seven adopted. Alterations to the originals were minor.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1948 – British Companies Act 1948 “prefigured a new and more onerous external regulation of corporate financial reporting in New Zealand” &lt;ref&gt;Keenan, 2000, p.97&lt;/ref&gt;
*1950 – Accounting Practice and Procedure Committee (APPC). 
**Its functions were to “make pronouncements for the guidance of members” and “give evidence to on behalf of the Society before various [Government] committees” (TAJ, August 1950, p.&amp;nbsp;271, Cited in Keenan, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;98). The Committee’s first two meetings discussed the development of accounting and auditing standards, and revisions to Recommendations on Accounting Principles. This however stalled and fell off the agenda. Keenan (2000) suggests that this was due to poor resourcing of the APPC as well as contention over the respective strengths of a collegiate vs individual approach to regulation.
**Also in 1950 the NZ Accountants’ and Auditors’ Association merged with the Society.
*1955 – Companies Act 1955 
*1958 – New Zealand Society of Accountants Act 1958. Contained provision authorising Society to “regulate the practice of the profession” in NZ. This was seen as grounds for the Society to establish accounting and auditing standards (Zeff, 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;1).
*1959–60 – [[University of New Zealand]] establishes chairs of accounting at each of its four main colleges.
*1961 – APPC replaced by the Board of Research and Publications (BRAP). Contained mixed membership of academics and practitioners. 
*1962 – May 1962 the BRAP approved commencement of a long-term project entitled Recommendations on Standards of Best Accounting Practice (TAJ, July 1962, p.&amp;nbsp;374, cited in Keenan, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;100).
*1964 – 1969
BRAP releases eight Tentative Statements on Accounting and Auditing Practice. Preamble to each Tentative Statement explained that statements issued in sequel to these would not be mandatory in any way. This highlights the continued predominance of individual over collegial regulation (Keenan states eight but Bradbury only mentions four). 
*1964 – The first of the eight Tentative Statements, Presentation of Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss, was published in October 1964. 
**This statement was the first official recommendation on an accounting standard that was not a transcription or pure adaptation of an English Institute Recommendation (Bradbury, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;7). 
**Note: The first Tentative Statements on Auditing appeared in October and November 1964. 
*1966  –  At the AGM of the NZ Institute of Cost Accountants held on 17 May 1966, it was resolved to wind up the Institute and transfer the funds and property remaining at 30 June 1966 to the New Zealand Society of Accountants. As part of the agreement, members of the Institute, at the date of winding up, would become members of the newly formed Cost and Management Accounting Division of the New Zealand Society of Accountants. [see CMA section for full details]
*1966 – Second tentative statement on deferred tax issued in October 1966. This adopted a position closer to the US’s Accounting Research Bulletin No 44.
*1966 – First Statement on Accounting Practice released in September 1966 by BRAP.
*1967 – BRAP recommendations on various measures to encourage compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and standards. Zeff (1979, p.&amp;nbsp;43) suggests that the Board may have been influenced by recent granting of authority by the Council of the AICPA to its Accounting Principles Board.
*1968 – Editorial in TAJ entitled “Improving Accounting Standards” gave strong support to requiring members’ compliance with collegiate regulation. The editorial uses the threat of external enforced regulation by suggesting that a failure to enforce compliance will result in the widening of the role of the Registrar of Companies, or the creation of an independent organisation such as the US S.E.C.
*1969 – Council accepts BRAP proposal due process. 
Proposed due process: 
A Statement, after being exposed as a Tentative Statement and revised, if necessary, by the BRAP, would be submitted to Council for consideration. Council could refer back to the BRAP. Council could pronounce, within twelve months of receipt, that the Statement was required (mandatory), or recommended (voluntary), or that the Statement be approved for publication without comment. 
*1970 – 1973 Above proposal comes into force. 
Three more Tentative Statements issued. Most significant was the Tentative Statement on Auditing Practice No.5: Auditing Standards.
*1972 – The Incorporated Institute of Accountants of New Zealand wound up its affairs and transferred its funds to the NZSA. The Society was now the only national organisation in the field.
*1973 – Council (NZSA) established a Professional Standards Committee to issue Statements of Standard Accounting Practice. Supersedes BRAP (?).
*1973 – Formation of [http://www.iasb.org/about/history.asp International Accounting Standards Committee] (IASC) in June 1973.
*1974 – Council approves Standard 7: Auditing Practice. This attempts to enforce adoption of financial reporting statements by linking compliance to Statements on Accounting Practice in the preparation of company accounts to a standard of auditing practice. For although not all company directors were members of the NZSA, creating a gap in the mandatory regime, all company auditors were members of the NZSA. Departures from the standards were to be referred to in the audit report and, where appropriate, result in a qualified opinion. The standards still did not have legal backing, however. This didn’t come until 1993 with the passing of the Financial Reporting Act 1993.
*1974 – NZSA became associate member of the IASC. Required NZSA to distribute IASC exposure drafts and transmit comments back to the IASC. See Bradbury (1999, p.&amp;nbsp;7) for a comparative table of the first ten standards issued by the ARSB and IASC.
*1989 – July 1989 the Public Finance Act passed. Requires Crown government departments and Crown agencies to prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP and have them audited. Similar requirements placed on local authorities in the same year. [source: CAJ, July 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;26]
*1990 – 2 NZSA’s Accounting Research and Standards Board issues seven exposure drafts which together comprised a proposed conceptual framework for financial reporting in NZ [A Proposed Framework for Financial Reporting in New Zealand, December 1991]. This framework proposed a set of concepts intended to apply to all sectors, i.e. sector neutral.
**The framework drew on the Australian (AARF) and US (FASB) conceptual frameworks and also corresponds with IASC framework. See Hooper et al. (1999, Ch. 7) or Mathews &amp; Perera (1996, Ch.6) for further detail.
*1993 – Statement of Concepts for General Purpose Financial Reporting to cover all general purpose financial reports from 1 January 1995. 
*1993 – The Financial Reporting Act 1993 established the Accounting Standards Review Board (ASRB) to approve FRSs. Provides overt legislative backing to financial reporting standards.
**The council of the NZSA appoints the Financial Reporting Standards Board (FRSB) to coordinate the development of financial reporting standards (FRSs), formerly known as statements of standard accounting practice (SSAPs). 
**Generally accepted accounting practice (GAAP) in NZ is defined by all FRSs and SSAPs on issue. These FRSs and SSAPs are to be issued by the FRSB of the Society of Accountants and then approved by the ASRB under the Financial Reporting Act 1993, which effectively gives them legal backing.
*1994 – Fiscal Responsibility Act 1994. Reinforces requirement on central government to use GAAP.
*1996 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand Act 1996
*1997 – FRSB decides to pursue policy of international harmonisation. 
*1999 – In May the first two exposure drafts based on IASB pronouncements are issued (EDs 86 and 87).
*2001 – International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) assumed responsibility (from the IASC) for setting accounting standards and designated International Financial Reporting Standards on 1 April 2001.
*2002 – Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in Australia announces that from January 2005 international accounting standards would be adopted in Australia. 
**October 2002 – Accounting Standards Review Board (ASRB) recommends to NZ government that listed issuers should comply from January 2007, with the option to adopt in January 2005. Samkin (2005, p.&amp;nbsp;9) notes:
**This recommendation departs from that made by the FRSB in ED-92, issued in June 2002, to the effect that financial reporting standards would be developed from international standards and that departures from these would only be made in rare and exceptional circumstances. No departures would now be permitted.
**December 2002 – ASRB announced that for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007, New Zealand reporting entities would be required to apply International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the preparation of their external financial reports. However, entities would have the option to adopt IFRS early from 1 January 2005. 
**New standards will apply to all general purpose financial reports, defined as: reports intended to provide information to meet the needs of those external users who are unable to require, or contract for, the preparation of special reports to meet there specific information needs.
*2004 – 24 November the Accounting Standards Review Board approved the stable platform of New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS). 
*2005 –  Voluntary adoption of NZ IFRS from 1 January. It appears that in the main only larger listed companies have taken the opportunity to adopt early. 
*2005 – The Institute of Chartered Accountants began operating as the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants in August 2005.
*2007 –  January 2007 NZ IFRS take mandatory effect for periods beginning on or after 1 January. NZ IFRS replaces the FRSs and SSAPs that defined pre-2007 GAAP.

==Institute of Cost Accountants==
#At the AGM of the NZ Institute of Cost Accountants held on 17 May 1966, it was resolved to wind up the Institute and transfer the funds and property remaining at 30 June 1966 to the New Zealand Society of Accountants. As part of the agreement, members of the Institute, at the date of winding up, would become members of the newly formed Cost and Management Accounting Division of the New Zealand Society of Accountants.
#Following considerable debate over the preceding two years, this CMA Division was wound up and a National Corporate Sector Committee established in June 1988. It was noted in the Accountants Journal of May 1988 that : "Members of the CMA Division will be entitled to use the CMA designation as long as they are members of the Society".
#The rules passed in 1996 when the NZSA became the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand allowed for three designations – CA, ACA and AT. There does not appear to be any reference to CMA.
 
It would appear from this that former members of the Institute of Cost Accountants are now regular members of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants.

'''Olav Fjell''' (born 28 June 1951) is a Norwegian businessperson. He was the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of [[Statoil]] from 1999 to 2003, and of [[Hurtigruten Group|Hurtigruten]] from 2007 to 2012.

==Career==
Fjell has a [[siviløkonom|siv.øk.]] degree from the [[Norwegian School of Economics]] in 1975 as well as education from the [[Norwegian Army|Royal Norwegian Army]]. His career started as an accountant at [[Kongsberg Gruppen|Kongsberg Vaabenfabrik]] in 1975 where he stayed until 1987, by which time he had become vice president. He had a continual employment in [[Bergen Bank]], [[Den norske Bank]] and finally as CEO of [[Postbanken]] until he was hired as CEO of Statoil in 1999. After quitting in Statoil in 2004 he worked as a strategic and financial adviser for [[First Securities]]. He was later chief executive of [[Lindorff]] from 2006 to 2007 and [[Hurtigruten Group|Hurtigruten]] from 2007 to 2012.

He has also had a number of [[board of directors|board positions]], including chairman of the [[Norwegian State Railways]] from 2000 to 2003,&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Olav Fjell|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=|publisher=|location=|url=http://www.snl.no/Olav_Fjell|language=Norwegian|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Eastern Drilling]] and [[Lindorff]]. He currently chairs of the boards of [[Statkraft]] and [[Deep Sea Supply]].

He is a fellow of the [[Norwegian Academy of Technological Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntva.no/index.php?option=com_club&amp;view=member&amp;id=128%3Afjell-olav&amp;Itemid=60|title=Medlemmer: FJELL, Olav|publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Technological Sciences]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
As a controversial businessperson, Fjell has had a strained relationship with the [[mass media|press]]. In his last period as [[Chief financial officer|CFO]] in Kongsberg, he had massive problems internally because of the company's economic fall and felt that the press was excessive and critical. As in 2003 with the [[Statoil corruption case]] in Iran it was [[Dagens Næringsliv]] that led the critical journalism. It ended with him being decommissioned from his position with Kongsberg.

Fjell was central in the corruption scandal that Statoil experienced in 2003. After pressure both internally and from the media the board had to remove Fjell on the evening of 22 September 2003. Statoil was fined {{NOK|20 million}} for corruption from the [[Norwegian National Authority for the Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime]]. Despite the seriousness of the case and the weakening of the name of Statoil, Fjell was according to the media given a compensation between NOK 7.5 and 10 million. In addition he sued Statoil with demands for early pension from 60 years equal to 66% of his wage. Statoil denied this agreement, though it was mentioned in the press release at the time of Fjells departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statoil.com/STATOILCOM/SVG00990.NSF/UNID/41256A3A0055DD31C1256DA900816B92?opendocument|title=Olav Fjell fratrer som konsernsjef i Statoil ASA|publisher=[[Statoil]]|language=Norwegian|date=23 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2005 Fjell won the court case, and he can expect{{Update after|2010|11|16}} payments from Statoil up to about NOK 40 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://web3.aftenbladet.no/innenriks/okonomi/article242673.ece|title=Fjell fikk medhold i voldgiftsretten|date=15 December 2005|first=Odd|last=Steinsholt|language=Norwegian|work=[[Stavanger Aftenblad]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''organization of the National Archives and Records Administration''' refers to the administrative and bureaucratic structure of the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] of the [[United States]].  The National Archives is considered an [[Independent_agencies_of_the_United_States_government|independent federal government agency]], receiving this status in 1985 after existing under the [[General Services Administration]] since the National Archives' founding in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Archival Milestones| publisher=National Archives and Records Administration| url=https://www.archives.gov/about/history/milestones.html| date=| accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Senior leadership==

The National Archives is overseen by its chief official, the [[Archivist of the United States]] who is a political appointee of the [[President of the United States|President]] but is not a member of the [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet]].  The current Archivist of the United States is [[David Ferriero]].  The Archivist is directly assisted by the Deputy Archivist of the United States who acts a second in command of the National Archives.  The current deputy archivist is Debra Steidel Wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Archives Leadership| publisher=National Archives and Records Administration| url=https://www.archives.gov/about/organization/senior-staff| date=| accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directly reporting to the Archivist of the United States are the chiefs of the four main Archival offices.  These are the:

* Chief of Staff
* Chief Operating Officer
* Chief Innovation Officer
* Chief of Management and Administration

The National Archives Executive Secretariat is an internal office reporting to the Chief of Staff.

These are the:

* NARA Inspector General

The office is headed by an Executive for Research Services who, as of 2017, is Ann Cummings.  The research services of the National Archives are considered susceptible to a [[Government shutdown in the United States|government shutdown]], meaning that public access to the National Archives will be closed in such an event.&lt;Ref&gt;Federal News Radio, "Your pay and benefits during a government shutdown", 16 Jun 2014&lt;/ref&gt;There are three main sub-offices of research services, these being:

* Office of Project Performance and Management

Research customer support further oversees the National Archives Library Information Center and serves as a liaison with such affiliated civilian history organizations such as [[Ancestry.com]].  The office of preservation programs maintains two branches, one for preservation and conservation efforts at the National Archives Building and the [[National Archives at College Park]], while the second branch is based in [[St. Louis]] and deals with preservation of records at the [[National Personnel Records Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/st-louis/archival-programs/preservation-program National Archives Preservation Programs]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Access Coordinators====
[[File:NationalArchivesAreas.jpg|225px|thumb|right|National Archives facilities map showing the various Archival Regions]]
Access coordinators are the research directors for National Archives services in various geographical regions around the United States and oversee the operations of the [[National_Archives_facilities#Regional_facilities|NARA Regional Offices]].

* Records Management Policy &amp; Outreach Office
* Records Management Oversight and Reporting Office

The Chief Records Officer also oversees the "Permanent Records Capture Team" which, along with the National Archives Appraisal Branch, identify United States government records which are considered critical or vital and should be maintained by the National Archives.  Both the capture team and appraisal branch are administratively part of the Records Management Operations Office.  Both the [[National Personnel Records Center]] and the [[Washington National Records Center]] are considered a part of agency services and answer to the Director of Federal Records Centers who, as of 2017, is David Weinberg.  

Agency services, in particular the federal records center system, are funded under a different method than research services, and most of agency services remain open during government shutdowns.

===Museum services===

A special branch known as the "Charters of Freedom" is responsible for the upkeep and storage of the actual [[United States Constitution]] and other critical historical documents located in the National Archives Rotunda in Washington, DC.  

The museum services branch also creates and oversees all public exhibits of National Archives materials.  As of 2018, the acting executive for museum services was Susan K. Donius.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives and Records Administration, "Senior Staff and Leadership Roster" (June 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Archives Administration==

The administrative needs of the National Archives are overseen by the Office of Management and Information.  The office is headed by the Chief of Management and Administration who oversees five major subordinate offices, each with its own chief officer, as follows:

* Office of Finance

* [[National Archives Trust Fund]]

Funding for the National Archives and Records Administration is determined as part of the [[United States federal budget]] which allocates "non-reimbursable" funds to the National Archives.  Reimbursable charges are collected from both government agencies and the public for specific archival services, mostly pertaining to the cost of reproduction and, in some cases, hourly fees for specialized research.  Collected service fees are placed into the National Archives Trust Fund.

===Business services===

The National Archives Business Support Services Office is concerned primarily with physical maintenance and upkeep of [[National Archives facilities]].  The office maintains two administrative branches known as the "Administrative Policy and Planning Division" and the "Storage Coordination and Logistics Office".  Two major sub-offices are the "National Archives Security Management Office", concerned with physical security at NARA sites and buildings, and the "Facility and Property Management Office" which oversees repairs, cleaning, and upkeep of facilities.  Both of these offices make heavy use of subcontractors to include private [[janitor|custodial]] companies as well as contracted [[security guard]]s.

In 2015, the security company contracted to guard the Washington National Records Center, located on the same federal complex as the [[United States Census Bureau]], suffered the death of a guard when a shooter opened fire in the early evening.  The death lead to renewed scrutiny on how the National Archives handles security, specifically that many of its buildings are privately guarded and not under the auspices of the [[Federal Protective Service (United States)|Federal Protection Police]].&lt;ref&gt;Greene, J.C. "Guard Dead After Shooting at U.S. Census Bureau Headquarters", Washington Post (17 Apr 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

He promised marriage to his girlfriend Matilde for after a trip to Latin America, where he would try to enrich himself quickly; after failing on his attempt in [[Mexico]], [[Santiago|Santiago of Chile]] and the [[Mendoza, Argentina|city de Mendoza]] – where he worked for a rail company – he traveled to the region of [[Bariloche]] to look for gold.&lt;ref name="DRN"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.rionegro.com.ar/arch200109/s30j09.html|title=Hace 69 años se suicidaba Primo Capraro|publisher=Diario Río Negro|author=Juárez, Francisco N.|accessdate=30 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He arrived to the zone of [[Nahuel Huapi Lake|lake Nahuel Huapi]], in April 1903, and installed himself in the lake Correntoso. There he devoted to carpentry and to the construction in wood, and was the constructor of the greater part of the first houses of [[Bariloche|San Carlos of Bariloche.]] When he gathered sufficient capital, he founded the Commercial Company and Grazier Chile Argentina and created a fleet of small crafts to cross the lake.&lt;ref name="DRN"/&gt;

Of impotent appearance, he was high and, blond, weighed almost 130 kg, and impressed to the scarce travellers that visited the isolated region by his initiative and his decision, since he did not use defend himself by force of the abuses of the English company that had the greater part of the earths of the zone.&lt;ref name="DRN"/&gt;

Between his employees he had a Swiss youngster, [[Otto Meiling]], that began the manufacture of [[Skiing|skis]] and initiated the practice of this sport in Bariloche.&lt;ref name="DRN"/&gt;

He was the founder of the Pension Mrs. Rosa, that over time would turn into the Hotel Correntoso, base for the tourist development of [[Villa La Angostura|Villa]] La angostura, place that also owes his starts to Capraro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://revistaroomin.com/nota_hotel_correntoso.php|title=El llamado del bosque|publisher=Revista Roomin|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the decade of 1920, almost all the economic and political activity of Bariloche went through Capraro, that was consul of Italy in the region, member of the Municipality, representative of several banks and insurance company, in addition to [[YPF]].&lt;ref name="LAD"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.laangosturadigital.com.ar/v3/home/interna.php?id_not=24090&amp;ori=web|title=Hace 79 años moría Primo Capraro|publisher=La Angostura Digital|accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis of 1930 left it to the edge of the ruin, and the elections of this year deprived it of the absolute control of the local politics that had exerted until then.&lt;ref name="DRN"/&gt; Even so, he had time to associate with other local employers to open the radiotelegraph office of Villa La Angostura on 15 May 1932, date in that it considers founded the current city.&lt;ref name="LAD"/&gt;

He supposedly killed himself On 4 October 1932.&lt;ref name="DRN"/&gt;

A square in Villa La Angostura, an avenue and a small monument in the city of Bariloche, and the most ancient private school of Bariloche honour with his name the memory of this pioneer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3443">'''Raúl Alfonso Sáenz Meraz''' (1910-1982) is a Mexican business man, known in the north of [[Mexico]] in the decades of 30's and 40's specially in the states of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and [[Durango]], for having been the first owner of a [[Coca-Cola]] bottling plant in Mexico, in the city of [[Nuevo Casas Grandes]], in Chihuahua state, bringing a source of income to an area of Mexico that was undergoing economical withdrawal. He was a very active entrepreneur of his time, acquiring [[magnesium]] mines scattered in [[Tarahumara|Sierra Tarahumara]], which provided more than 5,000 men with a job, in a time where it was very scarce. The wages paid in his mines were higher than most other places, earning himself a good reputation for being humane in a time where the rich weren't concerned about the lower classes. He also brought the first TV antenna to Chihuahua state, transmitting only stations from USA, since it was closer to the border than to the existing Mexican TV stations of the time, which were in [[Mexico City]]. 

Raúl Saenz married Maria Eustolia Nevarez, a young girl from a positioned family, and together they gave birth to 11 children, from which the three first were Armando, Rodolfo and Javier. They had only two daughters, Teresa and Maria del Socorro.

The Saenz Nevarez family was known for having the first gadgets and commodities of the time in northern Mexico, such as a TV, a washing machine, an electric iron, or a fridge. People from all social levels were welcomed inside their house to take a look at the new technology brought to town by Mr Saenz.
They earned the care of the peasants and bourgoise alike, and soon their last name became a signature of wealth and prosperity. Raúl Saenz's offspring were all studying in [[Jesuit]] [[boarding schools]], which back then was a kind of education only accessible to the rich, and it was believed to be the best. Raul then was at the peak of his success, he had amounted a large fortune, so he felt it safe to sell some his business to put weight off his shoulders. Among those business, he sold the bottling plant, and half of the mines. Little did he know it was going to be his downfall. Business started to become weaker and weaker ín the 60's and by the early 80's most of his wealth was in the hands of one of his sons, who was then appointed his father's fortune overseer. His name is still remembered all over [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], specially among the descendants of those of wealthy families in the 50's. Raul's descendants amount to more than a hundred at this date.

==Trivia==
His grandson, '''Raul Saenz ''' [http://www.ahus.is/index.php?option=com_ct&amp;task=view&amp;id=79&amp;Itemid=65] (credited as '''Raul Saenz'''), son of Javier Eduardo Saenz, is a prominent defendant of the rights of the [[Thai people|Thai]] community in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]].
He worked for the most important agency for immigrants in the [[nordic country]], Alþjóðahús [http://www.mbl.is/] as a translator and interpreter, besides his active role on the advancement of the [[expatriates]] in [[Iceland]], specially people from [[Thailand]]. He had first made himself acquainted with the diplomats at the Royal Thai Embassy in [[Mexico City]]. He presently works in the Ministry of Social Affairs and Social Security of Iceland.

'''Reflective listening''' is a [[Outline of communication|communication]] strategy involving two key steps: seeking to understand a speaker's idea, then offering the idea back to the speaker, to confirm the idea has been understood correctly. It attempts to "reconstruct what the client is thinking and feeling and to relay this understanding back to the client". Reflective listening is a more specific strategy than the more general methods of [[active listening]]. It arose from [[Carl Rogers]]' school of [[client-centered therapy]] in [[List of counseling topics|counseling]] theory.&lt;ref name=Lane2001&gt;Lane, Lara Lynn (2005). [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g2699/is_0006/ai_2699000601/ "Reflective listening"]. ''[[Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Empathy is at the center of Rogers' approach.&lt;ref name=PT&gt;Grogan, Jessica. March 11, 2013. It's not enough to listen. In: [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/encountering-america/201303/its-not-enough-listen 'Psychology Today']&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalmar Fisher, an associate professor at Boston College, developed a model for Reflective Listening that includes the following elements:&lt;ref&gt;Dalmar Fisher, Communication in Organizations (St. Paul, MN, West Publishing Company, 1993, pp. 430-436)&lt;/ref&gt;

* Focusing upon the conversation by reducing or eliminating any kind of distraction.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
* Genuinely embracing the speaker's perspective without necessarily agreeing with it. By engaging in a non-judgmental and empathetic approach, listeners encourage the others to speak freely. {{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
* Mirroring the mood of the speaker, reflecting the emotional state with words and nonverbal communication. This requires the listener to quiet his mind and focus fully upon the mood of the speaker. This mood will become apparent not just in the words used but in the tone of voice, posture and other nonverbal cues given by the speaker. The listener will look for congruence between words and mood.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
* Summarizing what the speaker said, using the speaker's own words rather than merely paraphrasing words and phrases, thereby mirroring the essential concept of the speaker. {{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
* Responding to the speaker's specific point, without digressing to other subjects.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
* Repeating the procedure for each subject, and switching the roles of speaker and listener, if necessary.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
* During the reflective listening approach, both client and therapist embrace the technique of thoughtful silence, rather than to engage in idle chatter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/08873267.1995.9986828 | volume=23 | issue=2 | title=Echoes after Carl Rogers: "Reflective listening" revisited. | year=1995 | journal=The Humanistic Psychologist | pages=259–271 | last1 = Sundararajan | first1 = Louise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Additional application==
Reflective listening has been found to be effective in a therapeutic setting. Subjects receiving reflective listening from a counselor have reported better therapeutic relationship and more disclosure of feelings.&lt;ref name=Rautalinko2007&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17760322 |year=2007 |last1=Rautalinko |first1=E |last2=Lisper |first2=HO |last3=Ekehammar |first3=B |title=Reflective listening in counseling: Effects of training time and evaluator social skills |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=191–209 |journal=American journal of psychotherapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive content is one of the two main options that a counselor has for reflecting the client's previous communication in the counseling session.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This form deals with people, places, problems, situations, and things.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Cognitive content can play a role in help with problem solving.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Incorporating cognitive content in problem solving makes it easier for clients to identify and work through issues. If neither the counselor nor the client can identify a problem that the client has, there is no need to problem solve and there is no need for counseling. Similar to problem solving where one initially identifies the quandary, counseling calls for identification of the fundamental issue in order to successfully change the client's behaviors or thought patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-0167.30.4.537 |title=Cognitive variables associated with personal problem-solving appraisal: Implications for counseling |year=1983 |last1=Heppner |first1=P.

'''Reinhold Rücker Angerstein''', born October 25, 1718 at [[Vikmanshyttan]], dead January 5, 1760 in [[Stockholm]], was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[metallurgy|metallurgist]], [[civil servant]] and [[entrepreneur]].
 
Angerstein was a member of an old family of Swedish [[Iron Masters]], of [[Germans|German]] descent. He passed his matriculation in [[Uppsala]] 1727 and then worked as an auditor at the [[Swedish Board of Mines]] (Bergskollegium) between 18 and 24 years of age.
 
At the age of 31 he started a series of long journeys abroad, financed by the [[Swedish Association of Iron Masters]] (Jernkontoret). From these trips he wrote extensive and illustrated travel accounts back to [[Sweden]]. He primarily described technical and economic observations from mining and from Iron and Steel Works. Between 1749 and 1757 he was constantly travelling, with only few short spells in [[Sweden]]: in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Portugal]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]].

After returning to Sweden he got a position at Bergskollegium as Director of Steelworks (Direktör för rikets gröfre svartsmide). There exist illustrations also from his inspection tours of Swedish Iron Works. Towards the end of his life he purchased the [[Vira bruk|Vira Iron Works]] in [[Uppland]] in 1757, northeast of Stockholm, renowned for forging of weapons for the army. He had far-reaching plans to extend this plant, but had no time to implement them before his death in 1760.

Between 1753 and 1755 he visited [[England]] and [[Wales]], where he was considered an industrial spy. His visit to [[Sheffield]] was brief, less than a day, and it has been suggested that he was driven out of the town for showing too much interest in the crucible process newly invented by [[Benjamin Huntsman]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120712001541/http://hri.shef.ac.uk/huntsman/history_stage8.html materialising Sheffield&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Beginnings ===

[[image:Carl_Röchling_2.jpg | frame type|right|200px  | Carl Röchling (1827-1910) managed the company at the beginning of the 20th century alone for twenty years.]]

In 1822 Friedrich Ludwig Röchling founded a coal enterprise in [[Saarbrücken]]. After his death in 1836, his four nephews - Theodor, Ernst, Carl and Fritz -  were left with the business, which was  named Gebrüder Röchling KG.  They began the industrial [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] and [[iron]] manufacturing in the midst of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nutzinger |first=D. Richard  |date=1929 |title= Das Haus Röchling in [[Ludwigshafen]] a. Rh. 1849-1929.

Hofer A.G. |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of his brothers Carl Röchling (1827-1910) managed the company alone for twenty years until the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seibold |first=Gerhard |date=2001 |title= Röchling. Kontinuität im Wandel |trans-title=Röchling. Continuity in Change |url= |language=German |location=Stuttgart |publisher= |isbn=3-7995-0101-0|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then bought the [[Völklingen Ironworks]], which was run under the name Völklinger Eisenwerk Gebrüder Röchling.  In 1860, the newly opened rail line near the production site, had a benefitial impact on the iron mill, as well as the addition of parts of [[Alsace|Elsass]] and [[Lorraine|Lothringen]] to the German empire after the war 1870/71.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seibold |first=Gerhard |date=2001 |title= Röchling. Kontinuität im Wandel |trans-title=Röchling. Continuity in Change |url= |language=German |location=Stuttgart |publisher= |isbn=3-7995-0101-0|pages=115–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After acquiring this [[iron mill]], which was given [[World Heritage site|World Heritage]] status in 1994 by [[UNESCO]], Röchling developed into the largest iron carrier manufacturer in Germany. In 1883, the first [[blast furnace]] was taken into operation in Völklingen.&lt;ref name="huette"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.voelklinger-huette.org/weltkulturerbe-voelklinger-huette/geschichte/ |title= Die Geschichte der Völklinger Hütte |author= voelklinger-huette.org |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= 2018-04-24 |format=  |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ Image: Röchlingsche_Eisen-_und_Stahlwerke.tif | frame type|right| 300px  |View from the station in Völklingen onto the iron and steel works of the Röchling company (1910)]]

After the death of his father Carl, [[Hermann Röchling]] (1872-1955) became general director of the company in 1898. Under his supervision, the ironworks developed into a “modern” blast furnace factory, which could also satisfy the rising demand for high-grade steel.&lt;ref name="memo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nutzinger |first=D.

=== World War I ===

Right after the beginning of [[World War I]], production of the iron works was adapted to meet the requirements of the war. On the company compound a factory was built to manufacture projectiles of almost any caliber for the [[artillery]]. In addition, a large part of the material needed for the production of the steel helmets of the german army was produced in Völklingen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seibold |first=Gerhard |date=2001 |title= Röchling.

[[Image:Edelstahl-Walzwerk_in_Völklingen.tif|frame type|right| 300px | High-grade steel mill in Völklingen (1920)]]

After the end of the war the victorious French powers withdrew the Röchling family's ownership of the iron mill in [[Thionville|Diedenhofen]] and the iron ore pits in Lothringen, as well as all locations in France. A [[Military justice|military court]] sentenced Hermann Röchling in his absence to ten years in prison for dismantling French operations in the occupied territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Banken |first=Ralf |work=Neue Deutsche Biographie (NDB)|editor-first= |title=Röchling, Hermann |publisher=Duncker &amp; Humblot |date=2003 |pages=705 |chapter= |isbn=3-428-11202-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1920 - 1945 ===

In the 1920s, the group included not only companies in the mining industry, but also banks and trading houses as well as extensive land and real estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seibold |first=Gerhard |date=2001 |title= Röchling.

Because of industrial exploitation of the occupied territories, "increase of the war potential of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] and considerable role in the execution of the program of [[deportation]] for the purpose of [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labor]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Militärregierung der Französischen Besatzungszone in Deutschland |first=Oberstes Gericht   |date=1949 |title= Unterlagen zu den Röchling-Prozessen: Urteile des General-Gerichts und des Obersten Gerichts |url= |language=German |location=Mannheim |publisher= |isbn= |pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hermann Röchling was senctenced by a French military court  to a ten-year imprisonment plus asset expropriation in 1949 and was deprived of his [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]], but released after two years of imprisonment.&lt;ref name="NDB" /&gt;

The 1960s and 1970s were shaped by the coal crisis and the following [[steel crisis]] for the Röchling Group.&lt;ref name="broschuere"/&gt; The company responded to the decline in revenue in these areas with diversification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seibold |first=Gerhard |date=2001 |title= Röchling.

In 1978 the “Völklinger Hütte” was sold to Arbed, today's Saarstahl AG.&lt;ref name="huette" /&gt;

Instead, the Röchling Group acquired holdings and complete companies in the fields of [[mechanical engineering]], [[telecommunications]], [[electrical installation]], [[franking]] systems, [[measurement]] and control technology. With the acquisition of the Seeber Group and Sustaplast KG, the declared expansion of the plastics processing sector began in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Röchling / Kunststoffbereich soll ausgebaut werden |url= |work=Handelsblatt |location= |date=1993-06-18 |pages=19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st Century===

At the beginning of the 21st century, the conglomerate employed more than 41,000 people in more than 300 subsidiaries and associated companies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Die Röchling-Gruppe – Familienclan herrscht über Mischkonzern |trans-title= The Röchling Group - Family Clan reigns diversified conglomerate |language=German |url= https://www.handelsblatt.com/archiv/die-roechling-gruppe-familienclan-herrscht-ueber-mischkonzern/2441382.html |work=Handelsblatt |location= |date=2004-11-24 | access-date=2018-04-26  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and generated sales of around € 6.1 billion. The biggest source of revenue was the electronics and defense group, Rheinmetall, in which Röchling held a stake of 42.1 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Röchling stützt Strategie von Rheinmetall |trans-title= Röchling supports Strategy of Rheinmetall |language=German |work=Handelsblatt |location= |date=2001-06-01 | pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Durchwachsene Bilanz bei Röchling |trans-title= Röchling with mixed Results |language=German |work=Saarbrücker Zeitung |location= |date=2001-06-27 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Manager Magazin]], the Röchling Group had "tangled" with the company's strong diversification and ramifications. The expansion of the subsidiary Rheinmetall under the controversial CEO Hans Brauner had increased sales, but brought no returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.manager-magazin.de/unternehmen/karriere/a-308583.html |title= Rüstige Alte, friedlicher Nachwuchs  |trans-title= Sprightly old folks - Peaceful Offspring |language=German|last=Scheele |first=Martin |date=2004-08-09 |website= manager-magazin.de |publisher= |access-date=2018-04-24 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in 2001, Röchling decided a fundamental change of strategy under the new non-family director [[Georg Duffner]]: abandonment of the conglomerate and further expansion of the business unit plastics processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Röchling setzt auf das Kunststoffgeschäft |trans-title= |language=German |work=Handelsblatt |location= |date=2004-06-11 | pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 Röchling sold its majority stake in Rheinmetall at a price of 570 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Seidlitz |first=Frank |date=2004-11-30 |title= Nach 50 Jahren hat sich die Industriellenfamilie vom Rüstungskonzern getrennt – Aktien breit gestreut.

During the conversion to a plastic producer, all family members withdrew from the operative core business in accordance with the [[shareholder]]s' resolution and moved to supervisory bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Müller |first=Anja |date=2017-10-16 |title= Wenn aus Nachfolgern Investoren werden |trans-title=  |work=Handelsblatt |location= |pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="familie"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Plate |first1=Markus |last2=Groth |first2=Torsten |last3=Ackermann |first3=Volker |title=Große Deutsche Familienunternehmen: Generationenfolge, Familienstrategie und Unternehmensentwicklung |publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |date=2011 |pages=215 |chapter= Gebr.

In 2001, Klaus Greinert, son-in-law of Richard Röchling and former managing director, joined the advisory board and became chairman of the family council. There he replaced Kurt Wigand Freiherr von Salmuth, who was a member of various family committees since 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Freiherr von Salmuth 70  |trans-title= |language=German |work=Börsen-Zeitung |location= |date=2001-01-20 | pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Bernd Michael Hönle, who had been managing director since 1994, the last operationally active family member changed to the supervisory board in 2008.&lt;ref name="familie" /&gt;

'''SMERA Ratings Ltd''' (SMERA) is a full service [[credit rating agency]] exclusively set up for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) in [[India]] and has grown to rate SME, mid &amp; large corporate . It provides ratings which enable MSME, SMEs,Corporates to raise bank loans at competitive rates of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finmin.nic.in/the_ministry/dept_fin_services/banking/smerafi.asp|title=Financial Institutions and others |publisher=Finance Ministry|date= |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, its registration with [[Securities and Exchange Board of India]] (SEBI), as a Credit Rating Agency and accreditation by [[Reserve Bank of India]] (RBI), in September 2012 as an external credit assessment institution (ECAI) to rate bank loan ratings under Basel II guidelines has paved way for SMERA to rate/grade various instruments such as: IPO, NCDs, Commercial Papers, Bonds, Security Receipts, Fixed Deposits etc. In addition to this, RBI has told that Banks may use ratings of bank facilities (Bank Loan Ratings) from SMERA, to assign risks to loans for the purpose of computing capital adequacy requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-09-13/news/33817065_1_standardised-approach-risk-weights-smera# |title=Archived copy |access-date=23 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122202248/http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-09-13/news/33817065_1_standardised-approach-risk-weights-smera# |archive-date=22 November 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SMERA Ratings have gained wide acceptability and are now an integral part of the risk assessment process within the lending and investing community.

2) The Association of Development Financing Institutions in Asia and the Pacific (ADFIAP) has awarded SIDBI with "Outstanding Development Project Award" for setting up SMERA. The award was given under the SME Development Category during the 30th ADFIAP Annual Meeting held on 10 May 2007 at [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/smera-gets-adfiap-award/200935/1|title=SMERA gets ADFIAP Award|publisher=Financial Express|date= |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3) SMERA has been registered under [[Securities and Exchange Board of India]] (Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 1999 making it only the sixth rating agency in India to rate issues such as IPO, bonds, commercial papers, security receipts and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/industry-and-economy/banking/article1506262.ece|title=SMERA receives SEBI registration|publisher=Business Line|date=|accessdate=2011-04-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424051722/http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/industry-and-economy/banking/article1506262.ece#|archive-date=24 April 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2498">'''Salah Abdulla Nooruddin Nooruddin''' ({{lang-ar|صلاح عبد الله نور الدين نور الدين}}; born 1963) is [[Bahrain]]i [[Businessman]] and the former chairman of [[Leeds United Football Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23127891 | title=Leeds United: Salah Nooruddin becomes chairman | publisher=BBC | date=1 July 2013 | accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/419605/Leeds-United-s-new-chairman-speaks-exclusively-to-the-Daily-Express&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahraini-based businessman Salah Nooruddin, CEO of Envest Limited, initially bought a 3.33% stake in LUFC Holding Limited following the takeover of Leeds United by [[GFH Capital]]&lt;nowiki&gt; - an &lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Islamic]] [[investment bank]] with headquarters in [[Bahrain]]. Nooruddin was initially appointed vice-chairman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/latest-whites-news/salah-nooruddin-named-as-new-leeds-united-vice-chairman-1-5692630 | title=Salah Nooruddin named as new Leeds United vice-chairman | publisher=Yorkshire Evening Post | date=21 May 2013 | accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 21 May 2013 but following the end of [[Ken Bates]]' tenure as chairman Nooruddin became chairman on 1 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.motforum.com/article.php?page=28998 | title=A good day for Leeds United | publisher=Marching on Together | date=1 July 2013 | accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed that he had increased his stake in the club to 10%.

In early 2014 GFH Capital sold their majority stake in the club to Italian Businessman Massimo Cellino who then became majority shareholder by 75% this means GFH Capitol would only retain a 5% stake in the club while Nooruddin would retain a 10% stake through his company Envest Ltd while he would also look after the 10% stake in the club owned by the International Investment Bank.

In 2014 Nooruddin was removed as club chairman by new owner Massimo Cellino but would remain on the board of directors until April 2014 when he resigned from the board.

'''''The Strategy Paradox''''' is a [[business strategy]] book by author [[Michael E. Raynor]], who is the Distinguished Fellow with [[Deloitte]] Research. ''The Strategy Paradox'' was published in 2007 by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Currency/Doubleday]].  It was named a top ten book of 2007 by ''[[BusinessWeek]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://images.businessweek.com/ss/07/11/1130_business_books/index_01.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and a top five strategy book of 2007 by ''Strategy+Business''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.strategy-business.com/press/article/07408c?pg=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

''The Strategy Paradox'', the title and focus of the book sets up a ubiquitous but little-understood tradeoff.  The tradeoff is that most strategies are built on specific beliefs about an unpredictable future, but current strategic approaches force leaders to commit to an inflexible strategy regardless of how the future might unfold. It is this commitment to uncertainty that is the cause of "the strategy paradox."

==The Press==
In a high-profile case against the news magazine ''[[Tempo magazine (Indonesia)|Tempo]]'' following an article's "Ada Tomy in Tenebang?" (Is there Tomy in [[Tanah Abang]] ?) published in the March 3, 2003 issue of ''[[Tempo magazine (Indonesia)|Tempo]]'',&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A42646-2004Aug28.html |title=Magazine Case Tests Indonesian Press Freedom |author=Ellen Nakashima |date=29 April 2004 |work= |publisher=''The Washington Post'' |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tempo'' editor-in-chief [[Bambang Harymurti]] was found guilty.&lt;ref name="smh030509"/&gt;

The Central Jakarta District Court ordered ''[[Tempo magazine (Indonesia)|Tempo]]'' magazine to publicly apologize and to pay a fine of 500 million rupiah (US$59,000).  Tomy filed libel charges against PT Tempo Inti Media; chief editor Bambang Harymurti; chief deputy editor Toriq Hadad; reporters Ahmad Taufik, Bernarda Rurit, and Cahyo Junaidi; publisher Fikri Jufri and corporate director Zulkifli Lubis, according to a Tempo report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magazine found guilty of libel|url=https://cpj.org/x/ec6|website=cpj.org|accessdate=March 18, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presiding judge stated that, "Tempo failed to find the truth by covering both sides before publishing the article," said a report in [[The Jakarta Post]]. However, this conviction was later overturned on appeal.&lt;ref name="smh030509"/&gt;

In another high-profile case, in the provision of travellers cheques used in 2004 to bribe Indonesian politicians to elect Miranda Swaray Goeltom as Senior Deputy Governor in the Indonesian central bank, [[Bank Indonesia]], has been widely reported in the Indonesian media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3189&amp;Itemid=367 |title=Indonesia's Judicial Flying Circus |author= |date=12 May 2011 |work= |publisher=''Asia Sentinel'' |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Miranda said he did not know the owner of Bank Artha Graha. "Who owns it?" she told Tempo last Friday. "I do not know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dekat dengan Bos Artha Graha?

'''Workplace bullying''' is a persistent pattern of mistreatment from others in the workplace that causes either physical or emotional harm.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, C. &amp; Keashley, L. (2005). Bullying at work: A perspective from Britain and North America. In S. Fox &amp; P. E. Spector (eds.) Counterproductive work behaviour: Investigations of actors and targets (pp. 271-296). Washington DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;  It can include such tactics as [[verbal abuse|verbal]], [[nonverbal]], [[psychological abuse|psychological]], [[physical abuse|physical]] abuse and [[humiliation]]. This type of [[workplace aggression]] is particularly difficult because, unlike the typical [[school bullying|school bully]], workplace bullies often operate within the established rules and policies of their organization and their society. In the majority of cases, [[bullying]] in the workplace is reported as having been by someone who has authority over their victim. However, bullies can also be peers, and occasionally subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, C., &amp; Cooper, C. L. (2006). Workplace Bullying. In Kelloway, E., Barling, J. &amp; Hurrell Jr., J. (eds.), Handbook of workplace violence (pp. 47-90). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also investigated the impact of the larger organizational context on bullying as well as the group-level processes that impact on the incidence and maintenance of bullying behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, S., Troth, A &amp; Branch, S . (2010). Work-place bullying: A group processes framework ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology'', 84(4), 799-816.&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying can be covert or overt. It may be missed by superiors; it may be known by many throughout the organization.  Negative effects are not limited to the targeted individuals, and may lead to a decline in [[employee morale]] and a change in [[organizational culture]].&lt;ref name=SilentEpidemic&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201105/the-silent-epidemic-workplace-bullying |title=The Silent Epidemic: Workplace Bullying |last=Williams |first=Ray |work=Psychology Today |date=3 May 2011 |accessdate=2016-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20151121235011/https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201105/the-silent-epidemic-workplace-bullying |archivedate=21 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also take place as overbearing supervision, constant criticism, and they may work at hospice

==First known documented use==
The first known documented use of "workplace bullying" is in 1992 in a book by [[Andrea Adams]] called ''Bullying at Work: How to Confront and Overcome It''.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=workplace+bullying&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1990&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2Cworkplace%20bullying%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bworkplace%20bullying%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BWorkplace%20Bullying%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BWorkplace%20bullying%3B%2Cc0 Google ngrams]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrea Adams|Adams, Andrea]] with contributions from Crawford, Neil ''Bullying at Work: How to Confront and Overcome It'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
While there is no universally accepted formal definition of workplace bullying, several researchers have endeavoured to define it:
* According to Einarsen, Hoel, Zapf and Cooper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bullying and emotional abuse in the workplace: International perspectives in research and practice|authors=Stale Einarsen, Helge Hoel, Cary Cooper|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London|date=2003|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Bullying at work means harassing, offending, socially excluding someone or negatively affecting someone’s work tasks. In order for the label bullying (or mobbing) to be applied to a particular activity, interaction or process it has to occur repeatedly and regularly (e.g. weekly) and over a period of time (e.g. about six months). Bullying is an escalated process in the course of which the person confronted ends up in an inferior position and becomes the target of systematic negative social acts."
* According to [[Sarah J. Tracy|Tracy]], Lutgen-Sandvik, and Alberts, researchers associated with the Arizona State University's Project for Wellness and Work-Life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/about/wellness_and_worklife |title=Project for Wellness and Work-Life (PWWL) &amp;#124; Human Communication |publisher=Humancommunication.clas.asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210124054/http://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/about/wellness_and_worklife |archivedate=10 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; workplace bullying is most often "''a combination of tactics in which numerous types of hostile communication and behaviour are used''"&lt;ref name="nightmares pp. 151-152"&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=151–152|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|doi=10.1177/0893318906291980|volume=20|issue=2|issn=0893-3189|first1=Sarah J.|last1=Tracy|first2=Pamela|last2=Lutgen-Sandvik|first3=Jess K.|last3=Alberts|url=http://mcq.sagepub.com/content/20/2/148.abstract|title=Nightmares, Demons and Slaves, Exploring the Painful Metaphors of Workplace Bullying|date=2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123204945/http://mcq.sagepub.com/content/20/2/148.abstract|archivedate=23 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gary Namie|Gary and Ruth Namie]]&lt;ref name="namiedef"&gt;Namie, Gary and Ruth [http://www.workplacebullying.org/targets/problem/definition.html Workplace Bullying Institute Definition]&lt;/ref&gt; define workplace bullying as "''repeated, health-harming mistreatment, verbal abuse, or conduct which is threatening, humiliating, intimidating, or sabotage that interferes with work or some combination of the three''."
* Pamela Lutgen-Sandvik&lt;ref name="quit"&gt;Lutgen-Sandvik, Pamela [http://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~lutgensa/Lutgen%20Sandvik%202006%20Resistance%20to%20Bullying%20CMM.pdf Take This Job and ... : Quitting and Other Forms of Resistance to Workplace Bullying] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113132410/http://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~lutgensa/Lutgen%20Sandvik%202006%20Resistance%20to%20Bullying%20CMM.pdf |date=13 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; expands this definition, stating that workplace bullying is "''persistent verbal and nonverbal aggression at work, that includes personal attacks, social ostracism, and a multitude of other painful messages and hostile interactions''."   
* Catherine Mattice and Karen Garman define workplace bullying as "''systematic aggressive communication, manipulation of work, and acts aimed at humiliating or degrading one or more individual that create an unhealthy and unprofessional power imbalance between bully and target(s), result in psychological consequences for targets and co-workers, and cost enormous monetary damage to an organization’s bottom line''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&amp;context=aglecdiss |title=Mattice, C.M., &amp; Garman, K.

* Employers can also be bullies. Bad employers use bullying strategically to rid the workplace of good employees to avoid a legal obligation, such as paying [[unemployment compensation]] or a worker's compensation claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abusergoestowork.com/employers-that-bully/|title=Lost in Discussion: Employers that Bully|date=4 July 2012|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170319123420/http://abusergoestowork.com/employers-that-bully/|archivedate=19 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employers also use bullying tactics to drive out employees who demand legal pay or overtime or assert a legal right to organize collectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abusergoestowork.com/workplace-bullying-the-big-picture/|title=Workplace Bullying: The Big Picture|date=25 November 2012|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170318001323/http://abusergoestowork.com/workplace-bullying-the-big-picture/|archivedate=18 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common type of complaint filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission involves retaliation, where an employer harasses or bullies an employee for objecting to illegal discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/charges.cfm|title=Charge Statistics|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317054201/https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/charges.cfm|archivedate=17 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia Barnes, author of ''Surviving Bullies, Queen Bees &amp; Psychopaths in the Workplace'', argues that employers that bully are a critical but often overlooked aspect of the problem in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Patricia G. (2012), "Surviving Bullies, Queen Bees &amp; Psychopaths in the Workplace." {{ISBN|978-0-615-64241-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it can occur in a variety of contexts and forms, it is also useful to define workplace bullying by the key features that these behaviours possess. Bullying is characterized by:&lt;ref&gt;Einarsen, 1999; Keashly &amp; Harvey 2004; Lutgen-Sandvik, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* Repetition (occurs regularly)
* Duration (is enduring)
* Escalation (increasing aggression)
* [[Power (social and political)|Power]] disparity (the target lacks the power to successfully defend themselves)
* Attributed intent

This distinguishes bullying from isolated behaviours and other forms of [[Occupational stress|job stress]] and allows the term workplace bullying to be applied in various contexts and to behaviours that meet these characteristics. Many observers agree that bullying is often a repetitive behaviour. However, some experts who have dealt with a great many people who report abuse also categorize some once-only events as bullying, for example with cases where there appear to be severe sequelae.&lt;ref&gt;See: Thomas Sebok and Mary Chavez Rudolph, "Cases Involving Allegations of Workplace Bullying: Threats to Ombuds Neutrality and Other Challenges," JIOA, 2010, vol.3, no 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding the common understanding of bullying to include single, severe episodes also parallels the legal definitions of sexual harassment in the US.

According to Pamela Lutgin-Sandvik,&lt;ref name="cycle"&gt;Lutgin-Sandvik, Pamela, [http://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/undergraduate/pdf/TheCommunicativeCycleofEmployeeEmotionalAbuse-GenerationandRegenerationofWorkplaceMistreatme.pdf The Communicative Cycle of Employee Emotional Abuse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612011734/http://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/undergraduate/pdf/TheCommunicativeCycleofEmployeeEmotionalAbuse-GenerationandRegenerationofWorkplaceMistreatme.pdf |date=12 June 2010 }}, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of unifying language to name the phenomenon of workplace bullying is a problem because without a unifying term or phrase, individuals have difficulty naming their experiences of abuse, and therefore have trouble pursuing justice against the bully. Unlike sexual harassment, which named a specific problem and is now recognized in law of many countries (including U.S.), workplace bullying is still being established as a relevant social problem and is in need of a specific vernacular.

Euphemisms intended to trivialize bullying and its impact on bullied people include: incivility, disrespect, difficult people, personality conflict, negative conduct, and ill treatment.  Bullied people are labelled as insubordinate when they resist the bullying treatment.

There is no exact definition for bullying behaviours in workplace, which is why different terms and definitions are common. For example, mobbing is a commonly used term in France and Germany, where it refers to a "mob" of bullies, rather than a single bully; this phenomenon is not often seen in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;LEYMANN, H., 1990. Mobbing and Psychological Terror at Workplaces. Violence and victims, 5(2), pp. 119-126&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2015}} In the United States, aggression and emotional abuse are frequently used terms, whereas harassment is the term preferred in Finland.  Workplace bullying is primarily used in Australia, UK, and Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;BARON, R.A. and NEUMAN, J.H., 1998.

== Statistics ==
Bosses are the most common bullies. In fact, approximately 72% of bullies outrank their victims.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Kinsey Goman, “Is Your Boss a Bully?” Forbes, April 6, 2014, {{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918173233/https://www.forbes.com/sites/ |archivedate=18 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }} carolkinseygoman/2014/04/06/is-your-boss-a-bully/&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics&lt;ref name="genderstats"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.workplacebullying.org/research.html |title=The 2007 WBI-Zogby Survey |publisher=Workplacebullying.org |date=29 April 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107071240/http://www.workplacebullying.org/research.html |archivedate=7 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the 2007 WBI-Zogby survey show that 13% of U.S. employees report being bullied currently, 24% say they have been bullied in the past and an additional 12% say they have witnessed workplace bullying. Nearly half of all American workers (49%) report that they have been affected by workplace bullying, either being a target themselves or having witnessed abusive behaviour against a co-worker.

Although socioeconomic factors may play a role in the abuse, researchers from the Project for Wellness and Work-Life&lt;ref name="nightmares pp. 151-152"/&gt; suggest that "workplace bullying, by definition, is not explicitly connected to demographic markers such as sex and ethnicity".&lt;ref name="nightmares pp. 151-152"/&gt;  Because one in ten employees experiences workplace bullying, the prevalence of this issue is cause for great concern, even as initial data about this issue are reviewed.

According to the 2010 [[National Health Interview Survey#Research topics|National Health Interview Survey Occupational Health Supplement]] (NHIS-OHS), the national prevalence rate for workers reporting having been threatened, bullied, or harassed by anyone on the job was 8%.&lt;ref name = alterman1&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Alterman|first1= T|last2= Luckhaupt|first2= SE|last3= Dahlhamer|first3= JM|last4= Ward|first4= BW|last5= Calvert|first5= GM|title= Job insecurity, work-family imbalance, and hostile work environment: Prevalence data from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey|journal= Am J Ind Med|volume=56|issue=6|pages=660–669|date=June 2013| pmid=23023603|doi=10.1002/ajim.22123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Dr. Judy Fisher-Blando&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lentzleadership.com/index.php?page_name=dr.judy_blando |title=The Lentz Leadership Institute LLC |publisher=Lentzleadership.com |accessdate=2012-08-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808110739/http://www.lentzleadership.com/index.php?page_name=dr.judy_blando |archivedate=8 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote a doctoral research dissertation on ''Aggressive behaviour: Workplace Bullying and Its Effect on Job Satisfaction and Productivity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workplaceviolence911.com/docs/20081215.pdf |title=Workplace Bullying: Aggressive Behavior and its effect on Job Satisfaction and Productivity |last=Fisher-Blando| first=Judith Lynn|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-04-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019123522/http://www.workplaceviolence911.com/docs/20081215.pdf| archive-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific study determined that almost 75% of employees surveyed had been affected by workplace bullying, whether as a target or a witness. Further research showed the types of bullying behaviour, and organizational support.

=== Gender ===
In terms of gender, the Workplace Bullying Institute (2007)&lt;ref name="genderstats" /&gt; states that women appear to be at greater risk of becoming a bullying target, as 57% of those who reported being targeted for abuse were women. Men are more likely to participate in aggressive bullying behaviour (60%), however when the bully is a woman her target is more likely to be a woman as well (71%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/appointments/article6447287.ece |title=How a woman becomes a bully – The Sunday Times, June 7 |work=The Times |date=11 March 2012 |accessdate=2012-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611225342/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/appointments/article6447287.ece |archivedate=11 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study done by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/nhis/|title=CDC - Worker Health Information from the National Health Interview Survey - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|author=|date=15 December 2017|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228145656/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/nhis/|archivedate=28 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the NHIS-OHS confirms the previous finding, as higher prevalence rates for being threatened, bullied, or harassed were identified for women (9%) compared with men (7%).&lt;ref name="alterman1"/&gt;

=== Race ===

Race also may play a role in the experience of workplace bullying. According to the Workplace Bullying Institute (2007),&lt;ref name="genderstats" /&gt; the comparison of reported combined bullying (current + ever bullied) prevalence percentages reveals the pattern from most to least:
# Hispanics (52.1%)
# Blacks (46%)
# Whites (33.5%)
# Asian (30.6%)

The reported rates of witnessing bullying were:
# Asian (28.5%)
# Blacks (21.1%)
# Hispanics (14%)
# Whites (10.8%)

The percentages of those reporting that they have neither experienced nor witnessed mistreatment were:
# Asians (57.3%)
# Whites (49.7%)
# Hispanics (32.2%)
# Blacks (23.4%)

Research psychologist [[Tony Buon]] published one of the first reviews of bullying in China in the prestigious Journal PKU Business Review in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Buon, T (2005). The Management of Workplace Bullying. PKU Business Review, 5, 74-79, Peking University (PRC) (Published in Chinese){{cite web |url=.http://www.buon.net/PKUBullying.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709151722/http://www.buon.net/PKUBullying.pdf |archivedate=9 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marital status===
Higher prevalence rates for experiencing a [[hostile work environment]] were identified for divorced or separated workers compared to married workers, widowed workers, and never married workers.&lt;ref name="alterman1"/&gt;

===Education===
Higher prevalence rates for experiencing a hostile work environment were identified for workers with some college education or workers with  high school diploma or GED, compared to workers with less than a high school education.&lt;ref name="alterman1"/&gt;

===Age===
Lower prevalence rates for experiencing a hostile work environment were identified for workers aged 65 and older compared to workers in other age groups.&lt;ref name="alterman1"/&gt;

With respect to age, conflicting findings have been reported. A study by Einarsen and Skogstad (1996) indicates older employees tend to be more likely to be bullied than younger ones.

===Industry===
Among industry groups, workers with higher prevalence rates of a hostile work environment, compared to all adults employed at some time in a 12-month period leading up to a survey in 2010 (8%), were in public administration (16%) and retail trade industries (10%). Lower prevalence rates of a hostile work environment were reported among those working in construction (5%); finance and insurance (5%); manufacturing (5%); and professional, scientific, and technical services industries (6%).&lt;ref name="alterman1"/&gt;

===Occupation===
For occupational groups, workers in protective service reported a higher prevalence rate (25%) of hostile work environments compared to the prevalence rate for all adults employed at some time in the past 12 months. Workers in community and social service occupations also experienced a relatively high rate (16%). Lower prevalence rates were observed among architecture and engineering (4%), computer and mathematical (4%), business and financial operations (5%), and construction and extraction (5%) occupations.&lt;ref name="alterman1"/&gt;

== Profiling ==
Researchers Caitlin Buon and [[Tony Buon]] have suggested that attempts to profile ‘the bully’ have been damaging &lt;ref name="buon.net"&gt;Buon T &amp; Buon, C (2007) The Bully Within. Counselling at Work. Summer {{cite web |url=http://buon.net/BullyingJournalArticle.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150510100132/http://buon.net/BullyingJournalArticle.pdf |archivedate=10 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They state that the "bully" profile is that ‘the bully’ is always aware of what they are doing, deliberately sets out to harm their ‘victims’, targets a particular individual or type of person and has some kind of underlying personality flaw, insecurity or disorder. But this is unproven and lacks evidence. The researchers suggest referring to workplace bullying as generic harassment along with other forms of non-specific harassment and this would enable employees to use less emotionally charged language and start a dialogue about their experiences rather than being repelled by the spectre of being labelled as a pathological predator or having to define their experiences as the victims of such a person. [[Tony Buon]] and Caitlin Buon also suggest that the perception and profile of the workplace bully is not facilitating  interventions with the problem. They suggest that to make significant progress and achieve behaviour change over the long term then, organisations and individuals need to embrace the notion that everyone must all potentially house ‘the bully’ within them and their organisations. It exists in workplace cultures, belief systems, interactions  and  emotional competencies and cannot be transformed if externalization and demonization continue the problem by profiling ‘the bully’ rather than talking about behaviours and interpersonal  interactions.&lt;ref name="buon.net"/&gt;

== Relationship among participants ==
Based on research by H. Hoel and C.L. Cooper, most the perpetrators are [[supervisor]]s. The second most common group is peers, followed by subordinates and customers.&lt;ref&gt;HOEL, H. and COOPER, C.L., 2000. Destructive conflict and bullying at work. Manchester School of Management, UMIST Manchester, UK., http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0950017010389228&lt;/ref&gt; The three main relationships among the participants in workplace bullying: 
* Between supervisor and subordinate
* Among co-workers
* Employees and customers

Bullying may also occur between an organization and its employees.

Bullying behaviour by supervisors toward subordinates typically manifests as an abuse of power by the supervisor in the workplace. Bullying behaviours by supervisors may be associated with a culture of bullying and the management style of the supervisors. An authoritative management style, specifically, often includes bullying behaviours, which can make subordinates fearful and allow supervisors to bolster their authority over others.

On the other hand, some researchers suggest that bullying behaviours can be a positive force for performance in the workplace. Workplace bullying may contribute to organizational power and control.

However, if an organization wishes to discourage bullying in the workplace, strategies and policies must be put into place to dissuade and counter bullying behavior. Lack of monitoring or of punishment/corrective action will result in an organizational culture that supports/tolerates bullying.

In addition to supervisor – subordinate bullying, bullying behaviours also occur between colleagues. Peers can be either the target or perpetrator. If workplace bullying happens among the co-workers, witnesses will typically choose sides, either with the target or the perpetrator. Perpetrators usually "win" since witnesses do not want to be the next target. This outcome encourages perpetrators to continue their bullying behaviour. In addition, the sense of the injustice experienced by a target might lead that person to become another perpetrator who bullies other colleagues who have less power than they do, thereby proliferating bullying in the organization.

Maarit Varitia, a workplace bullying researcher, found that 20% of interviewees who experienced workplace bullying attributed their being targeted to their differences from others.&lt;ref&gt;MAARIT VARTIA, 1996. The sources of bullying–psychological work environment and organizational climate. European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology, 5(2), pp. 203-214&lt;/ref&gt;

The third relationship in the workplace is between employees and customers. Although less frequent, such cases play a significant role in the efficiency of the organization. Overly stressed or distressed employees may be less able to perform optimally and can impact the quality of service overall.

The fourth relationship in the workplace is between the organization or system and its employees. An article by Andreas Liefooghe (2012) notes that many employees describe their employer as a "bully."

These cases, the issue is not simply an organizational culture or environmental factors facilitating bullying, but bullying-like behaviour by an employer against an employee. Tremendous power imbalances between an organization and its employees enables the employer to "legitimately exercise" power (e.g., by monitoring and controlling employees) in a manner consistent with bullying.

Although the terminology of bullying traditionally implies an interpersonal relationship between the perpetrator and target, organizations' or other collectives' actions can constitute bullying both by definition and in their impacts on targets. However, while defining bullying as an interpersonal phenomenon is considered legitimate, classifying incidences of employer exploitation, retaliation, or other abuses of power against an employee as a form of bullying is often not taken as seriously.

== Organizational culture ==
{{Main|Organizational culture|Bullying culture}}
Bullying is seen to be prevalent in organizations where employees and managers feel that
they have the support, or at least the implicit blessing of senior managers to carry on their abusive
and bullying behaviour.&lt;ref name=SilentEpidemic/&gt; Furthermore, new managers will quickly come to view this form of behaviour as
acceptable and normal if they see others get away with it and are even rewarded for it.&lt;ref name="Salin D 2010"&gt;Salin D, Helge H "Organizational Causes of Workplace Bullying" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

When bullying happens at the highest levels, the effects may be far reaching. People may be bullied irrespective of their organizational status or rank, including senior managers, which indicates the possibility of a negative domino effect, where bullying may cascade downwards, as the targeted supervisors might offload their own [[aggression]] onto their subordinates. In such situations, a bullying scenario in the [[boardroom]] may actually threaten the [[productivity]] of the entire organisation.&lt;ref name=Organisational&gt;Helge H, Sheehan MJ, Cooper CL, Einarsen S "Organisational Effects of Workplace Bullying" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographical culture ==
{{Main|Culture}}
Research investigating the acceptability of the bullying behaviour across different cultures (e.g.g Power et al., 2013) clearly shows that culture matters here. One's culture affects the perception of the acceptable behaviour. 
One's national background also influences the prevalence of workplace bullying (Harvey et al., 2009; Hoel et al., 1999; Lutgen-Sandvik et al., 2007).

Humane orientation is negatively associated with the acceptability of bullying for WRB (Work related bullying).
Performance orientation is positively associated with the acceptance of bullying. Future orientation is negatively associated with the acceptability of bullying. A culture of femininity suggests that individuals who live and work in this kind of culture tend to value [[interpersonal relationships]] to a greater degree.

Three broad dimensions  have been mentioned in relation to workplace bullying: power distance; masculinity versus femininity; and [[individualism]] versus [[collectivism]] (Lutgen-Sandvik et al., 2007).

In Confucian Asia, which has a higher performance orientation than Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, bullying may be seen as an acceptable price to pay for performance. The value Latin America holds for personal connections with employees and the higher humane orientation of Sub-Saharan Africa may help to explain their distaste for bullying. A culture of individualism in the US implies competition, which may increase the likelihood of workplace bullying situations.

==Culture of fear==
{{Main|Culture of fear}}
Ashforth discussed potentially destructive sides of [[leadership]] and identified what he referred to as [[petty tyrants]], i.e., leaders who exercise a tyrannical style of management, resulting in a climate of fear in the workplace.&lt;ref name=ashforth&gt;''Petty tyranny in organizations '', Ashforth, Blake, Human Relations, Vol. 47, No. 7, 755-778 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Partial or intermittent negative [[reinforcement]] can create an effective climate of fear and [[doubt]].&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When employees get the sense that bullies "get away with it," a climate of fear may be the result.&lt;ref name="Organisational"/&gt; Several studies have confirmed a relationship between bullying, on the one hand, and an autocratic leadership and an authoritarian way of settling [[Workplace conflict|conflicts]] or dealing with disagreements, on the other. An authoritarian style of leadership may create a climate of fear, where there is little or no room for dialogue and where complaining may be considered futile.&lt;ref name="Salin D 2010"/&gt;

In a study of public-sector union members, approximately one in five workers reported having considered [[Turnover (employment)|leaving]] the workplace as a result of witnessing bullying taking place. Rayner explained these figures by pointing to the presence of a climate of fear in which employees considered reporting to be unsafe, where bullies had "got away with it" previously despite management knowing of the presence of bullying.&lt;ref name=Organisational/&gt;

==Kiss up kick down==
{{Main|Kiss up kick down}}
The workplace bully is often expert at knowing how to work the system. They can spout all the current management buzzwords about supportive management but basically use it as a cover. By keeping their abusive behaviour hidden, any charges made by individuals about his or her bullying will always come down to your word against his. They may have a ''kiss up kick down'' personality, wherein they are always highly cooperative, respectful, and caring when talking to upper management but the opposite when it comes to their relationship with those whom they supervise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/workplace/2010-12-28-bullyboss28_CV_N.htm | last=Petrecca |first= Laura |date=27 Dec 2010| title= Bullying by the boss is common but hard to fix. |work=USA Today | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160307090535/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/workplace/2010-12-28-bullyboss28_CV_N.htm |archive-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullies tend to [[ingratiate]] themselves to their bosses while [[intimidating]] subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftlocal1904.org/bully_workshop.pdf |title= How to manage a bully boss - Council of NJ State College Locals, AFT |date=15 Oct 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313114139/http://aftlocal1904.org/bully_workshop.pdf| archive-date=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/mary-donohue/bad-managers_b_4017881.html | last=Donohue | first=Mary |title=Fighting Back Against the Tyranny of the Manager|date=10 Feb 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091303/http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/mary-donohue/bad-managers_b_4017881.html | archive-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be socially popular with others in management, including those who will determine
their fate. Often, a workplace bully will have mastered ''kiss up kick down'' tactics that hide their abusive side from superiors who review their performance.&lt;ref&gt;DC Yamada (2008) Workplace bullying and ethical leadership - Journal of Values-Based Leadership, Vol. 1, No. 2, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of this ''kiss up kick down'' strategy:&lt;ref&gt;T Portis (2 Jan 2011) Understanding the Psychology of the Kiss-Up/Kick-Down Leader Lightkeepers Journal&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A bully's mistakes are always concealed or [[blamed]] on underlings or circumstances beyond their control
* A bully keeps the target under constant [[Stress (psychological)|stress]]
* A bully's power base is fear, not respect
* A bully withholds information from subordinates and keeps the information flow top-down only
* A bully blames [[Workplace conflict|conflicts]] and problems on subordinate's lack of competence, poor attitude, or character flaws
* A bully creates an unnatural work environment where people constantly walk on eggshells and are compelled to behave in ways they normally would not

==Fight or flight==
{{Main|Fight-or-flight response}}
The most typical reactions to workplace bullying are to do with the survival instinct – "fight or flight" – and
these are probably a victim's healthier responses to bullying. Flight is a legitimate and valid response to bullying. It is very common, especially in organizations in which upper management cannot or will not deal with the bullying. In hard economic times, however, flight may not be an option, and fighting may be the only choice.&lt;ref name=Killoren&gt;Robert Killoren (2014) The Toll of Workplace Bullying - Research Management Review, Volume 20, Number 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Fighting the bullying can require near heroic action, especially if the bullying targets just one or two individuals. It can also be a difficult challenge. There are some times when confrontation is called for. First, there is always a chance that the bully boss is labouring under the impression that this is the way to get things done and does not recognize the havoc being wrought on subordinates.&lt;ref name=Killoren/&gt;

== Typology of bullying behaviours ==
With some variations, the following typology of workplace bullying behaviours has been adopted by a number of academic researchers. The typology uses five different categories.&lt;ref name="Rayner"&gt;Rayner C, Hoel H, [[Cary Cooper|Cooper CL]] Workplace Bullying: What we know, who is to blame and what can we do? (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Peyton"&gt;Peyton PR Dignity at Work: Eliminate Bullying and Create a Positive Working Environment (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Threat to professional status''' – including belittling opinions, public professional [[humiliation]], accusations regarding lack of effort, intimidating use of [[discipline]] or competence procedures.
# '''Threat to personal standing''' – including [[Social undermining|undermining]] personal integrity, destructive [[innuendo]] and [[sarcasm]], making inappropriate jokes about the target, persistent [[teasing]], name calling, [[insults]], [[intimidation]].
# '''[[Isolation to facilitate abuse|Isolation]]''' – including preventing access to opportunities, physical or social isolation, withholding necessary information, keeping the target out of the loop, ignoring or [[Social exclusion|excluding]].
# '''Overwork''' – including undue pressure, impossible deadlines, unnecessary disruptions.
# '''[[Destabilisation]]''' – including failure to acknowledge good work, allocation of meaningless tasks, removal of responsibility, repeated reminders of blunders, [[setting up to fail|setting target up to fail]], [[Moving the goalposts|shifting goal posts]] without telling the target.

==Tactics==
Research by the Workplace Bullying Institute, suggests that the following are the 25 most common workplace bullying tactics:&lt;ref name=namie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workplacebullying.org/2013/04/19/top-25 |title=Workplace Bullying Institute Top 25 workplace bullying tactics|publisher=Workplacebullying.org |date=29 April 2011 |accessdate=2015-03-26| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808074613/http://www.workplacebullying.org/top-25/ |archive-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abusive workplace behaviours ==
According to Bassman, common abusive workplace behaviours are:&lt;ref&gt;Bassman ES Abuse in the workplace: management remedies and bottom line impact (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[respect|Disrespecting]] and [[Idealization and devaluation|devaluing]] the individual, often through disrespectful and devaluing language or [[verbal abuse]]
# Overwork and devaluation of personal life (particularly salaried workers who are not compensated)
# [[Harassment]] through [[micromanagement]] of tasks and time
# Over evaluation and [[psychological manipulation|manipulating]] information (for example concentration on negative characteristics and failures, [[setting up to fail|setting up subordinate for failure]]).
# Managing by threat and [[intimidation]]
# [[plagiarism|Stealing credit]] and taking unfair advantage
# Preventing access to opportunities
# Downgrading an employee's capabilities to justify [[Layoff|downsizing]]
# Impulsive destructive behaviour

According to Hoel and [[Cary Cooper|Cooper]], common abusive workplace behaviours are:&lt;ref&gt;Hoel, H. &amp; [[Cary Cooper|Cooper, C.L]].

# Having opinions and views ignored
# Withholding information which affects the target's performance
# Being exposed to an unmanageable workload
# Being given tasks with unreasonable or impossible targets or deadlines
# Being ordered to do work below competence
# Being ignored or facing hostility when the target approaches
# Being [[humiliated]] or ridiculed in connection with work
# Excessive monitoring of a person's work (see [[micromanagement]])
# Spreading gossip
# [[Insulting]] or offensive remarks made about the target's person (i.e. habits and background), attitudes or private life
# Having key areas of responsibility removed or replaced with more trivial or unpleasant tasks.
Abusive cyberbullying in the workplace can have serious socioeconomic and psychological consequences on the victim. Workplace cyberbullying can lead to sick leave due to depression which in turn can lead to loss of profits for the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Randy A. Sancone &amp; Lori A.

=== Blue-collar jobs ===
Bullying has been identified as prominent in [[blue collar]] jobs including on the oil rigs, and in mechanical areas and machine shops, warehouses and factories.

School teachers are commonly the subject of bullying but they are also sometimes the originators of bullying within a school environment.

=== Legal profession ===
{{Main|Bullying in the legal profession}}
Bullying in the [[legal profession]] is believed to be more common than in some other professions. It is believed that its adversarial, hierarchical tradition contributes towards this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unswlawjournal.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/t1_le_mire_and_owens.pdf Le Mire, Suzanne; Owens, Rosemary ''A propitious moment?: Workplace bullying and regulation of the legal profession'' University of New South Wales Law Journal, The Volume 37 Issue 3 (Dec 2014)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201001112/http://www.unswlawjournal.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/t1_le_mire_and_owens.pdf |date=1 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women, trainees and solicitors who have been qualified for five years or less are more impacted, as are ethnic minority lawyers and lesbian, gay and bisexual lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalonline.co.uk/News/1009923.aspx#.VMfxpyzp-24 Society publishes guidance on tackling bullying in solicitor profession] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201001313/http://www.journalonline.co.uk/News/1009923.aspx |date=1 February 2015 }} The Journal of the Law Society of Scotland 27 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military ===
{{Main|Bullying in the military}}
Bullying exists to varying degrees in the [[military]] of some countries, often involving various forms of [[hazing]] or abuse by higher members of the [[military hierarchy]].

=== Volunteering ===

Bullying can be common in volunteering settings. For example, one study found bullying to be the most significant factor of complaints amongst volunteers 
.&lt;ref&gt;[https://probonoaustralia.com.au/news/2013/09/volunteers-report-bullying-as-major-rights-violation/ Volunteers Report Bullying as Major Rights Violation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827125805/https://probonoaustralia.com.au/news/2013/09/volunteers-report-bullying-as-major-rights-violation/ |date=27 August 2017 }} Pro bono Australia&lt;/ref&gt;  Volunteers often do not have access to protections available to paid employees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safework.nsw.gov.au/law-and-policy/volunteering|title=Volunteering|first=SafeWork|last=NSW|date=|website=nsw.gov.au|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313040434/http://www.safework.nsw.gov.au/law-and-policy/volunteering|archivedate=13 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; so while laws may indicate that bullying is a violation of rights, volunteers may have no means to address it.

== Forms ==
[[Tim Field]] suggested that workplace bullying takes these forms:&lt;ref name="what"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bullyonline.org/workbully/bully.htm |last=Field |first=Tim |title=Bullying: what is it? | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512150521/http://bullyonline.org/index.php/bullying/15-am-i-being-bullied |archive-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Serial bullying''' — the source of all dysfunction can be traced to one individual, who picks on one employee after another and destroys them, then moves on. Probably the most common type of bullying.
* '''Secondary bullying''' — the pressure of having to deal with a serial bully causes the general behaviour to decline and sink to the lowest level.
* '''Pair bullying''' — this takes place with two people, one active and verbal, the other often watching and listening.
* '''Gang bullying or group bullying''' — is a serial bully with colleagues. Gangs can occur anywhere, but flourish in corporate bullying climates. It is often called [[mobbing]] and usually involves [[scapegoating]] and [[victimisation]].
* '''Vicarious bullying''' — two parties are encouraged to fight. This is the typical "[[Triangulation (psychology)|triangulation]]" where the aggression gets passed around.
* '''Regulation bullying''' — where a serial bully forces their target to comply with rules, regulations, procedures or laws regardless of their appropriateness, applicability or necessity.
* '''Residual bullying''' — after the serial bully has left or been fired, the behaviour continues. It can go on for years.
* '''[[Legal abuse|Legal bullying]] ''' — the bringing of a vexatious legal action to control and punish a person.
* '''Pressure bullying or unwitting bullying''' — having to work to unrealistic time scales or inadequate resources.
* '''Corporate bullying''' — where an employer abuses an employee with impunity, knowing the law is weak and the job market is soft.
* '''Organizational bullying''' — a combination of pressure bullying and corporate bullying. Occurs when an organization struggles to adapt to changing markets, reduced income, cuts in budgets, imposed expectations and other extreme pressures.
* '''Institutional bullying''' — entrenched and is accepted as part of the culture.
* '''Client bullying''' — an employee is bullied by those they serve, for instance subway attendants or public servants.
* '''[[Cyber bullying|Cyberbullying]]''' — the use of information and communication technologies to support deliberate, repeated, and hostile behaviour by an individual or group, that is intended to harm others.&lt;ref name=Summary5519228&gt;[https://www.srl.to/4hrEP8de Spacey, S. 2015. 1.

Adult bullying can come in an assortment of forms. There are about five distinctive types of adult bullies. A narcissistic bully is described as a self-centred person whose egotism is frail and possesses the need to put others down. An impulsive bully is someone who acts on bullying based on stress or being upset at the moment. A physical bully uses physical injury and the threat of harm to abuse their victims, while a verbal bully uses demeaning and cynicism to debase their victims. Lastly, a secondary adult bully is portrayed as a person that did not start the initial bullying but participates in afterwards to avoid being bullied themselves ("Adult Bullying").

== Emotional intelligence ==
{{Main|Bullying and emotional intelligence#Workplace}}
Workplace bullying is reported to be far more prevalent than perhaps commonly thought.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA&gt;Hutchinson, M. &amp; Hurley, J. (2013) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2834.2012.01372.x/ Exploring leadership capability and emotional intelligence as moderators of workplace bullying.] ''Journal of Nursing Management'', ''21'', 553-562. DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2834.2012.01372.x&lt;/ref&gt; For some reason, workplace bullying seems to be particularly widespread in healthcare organizations; 80% of nurses report experiencing workplace bullying.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt; Similar to the school environment for children, the work environment typically places groups of adult peers together in a shared space on a regular basis. In such a situation, social interactions and relationships are of great importance to the function of the [[organizational structure]] and in pursuing [[goal]]s. The emotional consequences of bullying put an organization at risk of losing victimized employees.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt; Bullying also contributes to a negative work environment, is not conducive to necessary cooperation and can lessen productivity at various levels.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt; Bullying in the workplace is associated with negative responses to stress.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt; The ability to manage emotions, especially emotional [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], seems to be a consistently important factor in different types of bullying. The workplace in general can be a stressful environment, so a negative way of [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with stress or an inability to do so can be particularly damning. Workplace bullies may have high [[social intelligence]] and low [[emotional intelligence]] (EI).&lt;ref name=HutchinsonB&gt;Hutchinson, M. (2013) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2834.2012.01390.x/ Bullying as workgroup manipulation: a model for understanding patterns of victimization and contagion within the workgroup.] ''Journal of Nursing Management'', ''21'', 563-571. DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2834.2012.01390.x&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, bullies tend to rank high on the social ladder and are adept at [[Social influence|influencing]] others. The combination of high social intelligence and low empathy is conducive to [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] behaviour, such that Hutchinson (2013) describes workplace bullying to be.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonB /&gt; In working groups where employees have low EI, workers can be [[persuaded]] to engage in unethical behaviour.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonB /&gt; With the bullies' persuasion, the work group is socialized in a way that [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalizes]] the behaviour, and makes the group tolerant or supportive of the bullying.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonB /&gt; Hutchinson &amp; Hurley (2013) make the case that EI and [[leadership]] skills are both necessary to bullying intervention in the workplace, and illustrates the relationship between EI, leadership and reductions in bullying. EI and ethical behaviour among other members of the work team have been shown to have a significant impact on ethical behaviour of nursing teams.&lt;ref&gt;Deshpande, S.P., &amp; Joseph, J.

DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2834.2012.01372.x&lt;/ref&gt; Higher EI is linked to improvements in the work environment and is an important moderator between conflict and reactions to conflict in the workplace.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt; The [[self-awareness]] and self-management dimensions of EI have both been illustrated to have strong positive correlations with effective leadership and the specific leadership ability to build healthy work environments and work culture.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt;

== Related concepts  ==

=== Abusive supervision  ===
{{Main|Abusive supervision}}
Abusive supervision overlaps with workplace bullying in the workplace context. Research suggests that 75% of workplace bullying incidents are perpetrated by hierarchically superior agents. Abusive supervision differs from related constructs such as supervisor bullying and undermining in that it does not describe the intentions or objectives of the supervisor.&lt;ref name=Tepper&gt;Tepper BJ Abusive supervision in work organizations: Review, synthesis, and research agenda Journal of Management June 2007 Vol 33 no 3 P261-289&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power and control===
{{Main|Abusive power and control}}
A power and control model has been developed for the workplace, divided into the following categories:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aidv-usa.com/wheel.html Power &amp; Control in the Workplace] American Institute on Domestic Violence&lt;/ref&gt;
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* overt actions
* covert actions
* emotional control
* isolation
* economic control
* tactics
* restrictions
* management privilege.
}}

=== Workplace mobbing ===
{{Main|Workplace mobbing}}
Workplace mobbing overlaps with workplace bullying. The concept originated from the study of animal behaviour. It concentrates on bullying by a group.

=== Workplace incivility ===
{{Main|Workplace incivility}}
Workplace bullying overlaps to some degree with workplace incivility but tends to encompass more intense and typically repeated acts of disregard and rudeness. Negative spirals of increasing incivility between organizational members can result in bullying,&lt;ref&gt;Beale, D. (2001). Monitoring bullying in the workplace. In N. Tehrani (Ed.), Building a culture of respect, managing bullying at work.&lt;/ref&gt; but isolated acts of incivility are not conceptually bullying despite the apparent similarity in their form and content. In case of bullying, the intent of harm is less ambiguous, an unequal balance of power (both formal and informal) is more salient, and the target of bullying feels threatened, vulnerable and unable to defend himself or herself against negative recurring actions.&lt;ref name="Rayner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peyton" /&gt;

== Personality disorders and dysfunctional personality characteristics==

=== Executives ===
In 2005, psychologists Belinda Board and Katarina Fritzon at the [[University of Surrey]], UK, interviewed and gave personality tests to high-level British executives and compared their profiles with those of criminal psychiatric patients at [[Broadmoor Hospital]] in the UK. They found that three out of eleven [[personality disorders]] were actually more common in executives than in the disturbed criminals. They were:
* [[Histrionic personality disorder]]: including [[superficial charm]], insincerity, [[egocentricity]] and [[psychological manipulation|manipulation]]
* [[Narcissistic personality disorder]]: including [[grandiosity]], self-focused lack of [[empathy]] for others, [[exploitative]]ness and independence.
* [[Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder]]: including [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]], excessive devotion to work, rigidity, stubbornness and dictatorial tendencies.

They described these business people as successful [[psychopaths]] and the criminals as unsuccessful psychopaths.&lt;ref&gt;Board, B.J. &amp; Fritzon, Katarina, F. (2005). Disordered personalities at work. ''Psychology, Crime and Law'', 11, 17–32&lt;/ref&gt;

According to leading leadership academic [[Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries]], it seems almost inevitable these days that there will be some personality disorders in a senior management team.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred F. R. Kets de Vries, The Dark Side of Leadership, ''Business Strategy Review'' 14(3), Autumn, page 26 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Industrial/organizational psychology]] research has also examined the types of bullying that exist among business professionals and the prevalence of this form of bullying in the workplace as well as ways to measure bullying empirically.&lt;ref&gt;Salin, D. (2001). Prevalence and forms of bullying among business professionals: A comparison of two different strategies for measuring bullying. European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology, 10, 425-441.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychopathy ===
{{Main|Psychopathy in the workplace}}
Narcissism, lack of self-regulation, lack of remorse and lack of conscience have been identified as traits displayed by bullies. These traits are shared with psychopaths, indicating that there is some theoretical
cross-over between bullies and psychopaths.&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;Harvey, M. G., Buckley, M. R., Heames, J. T., Zinko, R., Brouer, R. L. &amp; Ferris, G. R. 2007, ‘A Bully as an Archetypal Destructive Leader’, Journal of Leadership and rganizational Studies, vol. 14, no. 2, pp. 117–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying is used by corporate psychopaths as a tactic to humiliate subordinates.&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;Clarke J Working with Monsters: How to Identify and Protect Yourself from the Workplace Psychopath (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying is also used as a tactic to scare, confuse and disorient those who may be a threat to the activities of the corporate psychopath&lt;ref name=Clarke/&gt; Using meta data analysis on hundreds of UK research papers, Boddy concluded that 36% of bullying incidents were caused by the presence of corporate psychopaths. According to Boddy there are two types of bullying:&lt;ref name=Boddy&gt;Boddy, C. R. Corporate Psychopaths: Organizational Destroyers (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Predatory bullying – the bully just enjoys bullying and tormenting vulnerable people for the sake of it.
* Instrumental bullying – the bullying is for a purpose, helping the bully achieve their goals.

A corporate psychopath uses instrumental bullying to further their goals of promotion and power as the result of causing confusion and [[divide and rule]].

People with high scores on a psychopathy rating scale are more likely to engage in bullying, crime and drug use than other people.&lt;ref name=Nathanson&gt;Nathanson, C., Williams, K. M. &amp; Paulhus, D. L. 2006, ‘Predictors of a Behavioral Measure of Scholastic Cheating: Personality and Competence but Not Demographics’, [[Contemporary Educational Psychology]], vol. 31, pp. 97–122.&lt;/ref&gt; Hare and Babiak noted that about 29% of corporate psychopaths are also bullies.&lt;ref name=Snakes&gt;Baibak, P; Hare, R. D [[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]] (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has also shown that people with high scores on a psychopathy rating scale were more likely to engage in bullying, again indicating that psychopaths tend to be bullies in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Nathanson/&gt;

A workplace bully or abuser will often have issues with social functioning. These types of people often have [[psychopathic]] traits that are difficult to identify in the hiring and promotion process. These individuals often lack [[anger management]] skills and have a distorted sense of reality. Consequently, when confronted with the accusation of abuse, the abuser is not aware that any harm was done.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, P.A. (2009). The role of the consulting psychologist in the prevention, detection, and correction of bullying and mobbing in the workplace. Consulting Psychology Journal, 61(3), 169–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Narcissism ===
{{Main|Narcissism in the workplace}}
In 2007, researchers Catherine Mattice and Brian Spitzberg at [[San Diego State University]], USA, found that [[narcissism]] revealed a positive relationship with bullying. Narcissists were found to prefer indirect bullying tactics (such as withholding information that affects others' performance, ignoring others, spreading gossip, constantly reminding others of mistakes, ordering others to do work below their competence level, and excessively monitoring others' work) rather than direct tactics (such as making threats, shouting, persistently criticizing, or making [[false allegations]]). The research also revealed that narcissists are highly motivated to bully, and that to some extent, they are left with feelings of satisfaction after a bullying incident occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Mattice, MA &amp; Brian Spitzberg, PhD [http://noworkplacebullies.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Bully_conference_abstract.160111428.doc Bullies in Business: Self-Reports of Tactics and Motives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425093442/http://noworkplacebullies.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Bully_conference_abstract.160111428.doc |date=25 April 2012 }} San Diego State University, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Machiavellianism ===
{{Main|Machiavellianism in the workplace}}
According to [[Gary Namie|Namie]], Machiavellians manipulate and exploit others to advance their perceived personal agendas but he emphasizes that they are not mentally ill. They do not have a personality disorder, [[schizophrenia]] and neither are they psychopaths. In his view, Machiavellianism represents the core of workplace bullying.&lt;ref&gt;Namie, G. (2006). Why Bullies Bully? A Complete Explanation.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health effects ==
According to Gary and Ruth Namie, as well as Tracy, et al.,&lt;ref name="namiehealth"&gt;Namie, Gary and Ruth [http://www.bullyinginstitute.org/research/res/2003E.html The WBI 2003 Report on Abusive Workplaces] {{webarchive|url=http://www.workplacebullying.org/multi/pdf/N-N-2003C.pdf |date=29 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; workplace bullying can harm the health of the targets of bullying. Organizations are beginning to take note of workplace bullying because of the costs to the organization in terms of the health of their employees.

According to scholars at The Project for Wellness and Work-Life at [[Arizona State University]], "workplace bullying is linked to a host of physical, psychological, organizational, and social costs." [[Workplace stress|Stress]] is the most predominant health effect associated with bullying in the workplace. Research indicates that workplace stress has significant negative effects that are correlated to poor mental health and poor physical health, resulting in an increase in the use of "sick days" or time off from work (Farrell &amp; Geist-Martin, 2005).

The negative effects of bullying are so severe that [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and even suicide&lt;ref name="abcpushed"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-02-08/suicide-waitress-driven-to-the-edge-and-pushed/323884|title=Suicide waitress 'driven to the edge and pushed' |date=9 February 2010 | website=abc.net.au | last=Caldwell | first=Alison | series=The World Today | access-date=14 August 2017 | dead-url=no | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815114447/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-02-08/suicide-waitress-driven-to-the-edge-and-pushed/323884 | archive-date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yildirim, A., &amp; Yildirim, D. (2007). Mobbing in the workplace by peers and managers: mobbing experienced by nurses working in healthcare facilities in Turkey and its effect on nurses. Journal of Clinical Nursing, 16, 1444–1453.&lt;/ref&gt; are not uncommon. Tehrani&lt;ref&gt;Tehrani, N. (2004). Bullying: A source of chronic post traumatic stress? British Journal of Guidance &amp; Counselling, 32, 357–366.&lt;/ref&gt; found that one in 10 targets experience PTSD, and that 44% of her respondents experienced PTSD similar to that of battered women and victims of child abuse. Matthiesen and Einarsen&lt;ref&gt;Matthiesen, S.B., &amp; Einarsen, S. (2004). Psychiatric distress and symptoms of PTSD among victims of bullying at work. British Journal of Guidance &amp; Counselling, 32, 335–356.&lt;/ref&gt; found that up to 77% of targets experience PTSD.

In addition, co-workers who witness workplace bullying can also have negative effects, such as fear, stress, and emotional exhaustion.&lt;ref name="quit" /&gt; Those who witness repetitive workplace abuse often choose to leave the place of employment where the abuse took place. Workplace bullying can also hinder the organizational dynamics such as group cohesion, peer communication, and overall performance.

According to the 2012 survey conducted by Workplace Bullying Institute (516 respondents), Anticipation of next negative event is the most common psychological symptom of workplace bullying reported by 80%. Panic attacks afflict 52%. Half (49%) of targets reported being diagnosed with clinical depression. Sleep disruption, loss of concentration, mood swings, and pervasive sadness and insomnia were more common (ranging from 77% to 50%). Nearly three-quarters (71%) of targets sought treatment from a physician. Over half (63%) saw a mental health professional for their work-related symptoms. Respondents reported other symptoms that can be exacerbated by stress: migraine headaches (48%), irritable bowel disorder (37%), chronic fatigue syndrome (33%) and sexual dysfunction (27%).

== Financial costs to employers ==
Several studies have attempted to quantify the cost of bullying to an organization.
* According to the National Institute of Occupational Safety Health (NIOSH) mental illness among the workforce leads to a loss in employment amounting to $19 billion and a drop in productivity of $3 billion (Sauter, et al., 1990).
* In a report commissioned by the ILO, Hoel, Sparks, &amp; Cooper did a comprehensive analysis of the costs involved in bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/safework/violence/costof.htm |title=The cost of violence and bullying at work |publisher=International Labour Organization (ILO) |accessdate=13 February 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430202909/http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/safework/violence/costof.htm |archivedate=30 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They estimated a cost 1.88 billion pounds plus the cost of lost productivity.
* Based on replacement cost of those who leave as a result of being bullied or witnessing bullying, Rayner and Keashly (2004) estimated that for an organization of 1,000 people, the cost would be $1.2 million US. This estimate did not include the cost of litigation should victims bring suit against the organization.
* A recent Finnish study of more than 5,000 hospital staff found that those who had been bullied had 26% more certified sickness absence than those who were not bullied, when figures were adjusted for base-line measures one year prior to the survey (Kivimäki et al., 2000). According to the researchers these figures are probably an underestimation as many of the targets are likely to have been bullied already at the time the base-line measures were obtained.

Research by Dr. [[Dan Dana]] has shown organizations suffer a large financial cost by not accurately [[conflict management|managing conflict]] and bullying type behaviours. He has developed a tool to assist with calculating the cost of conflict.&lt;ref name="Dana"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mediationworks.com/about-us/mti-team/ |title=Dan Dana |publisher=Mediationworks.com |accessdate=2012-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425093442/http://www.mediationworks.com/dmi/biodan.htm |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, researcher Tamara Parris discusses how employers need to be more attentive in managing various discordant behaviours in the workplace, such as, bullying, as it not only creates a financial cost to the organization, but also erodes the company's human resources assets.&lt;ref name="parris"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/aboutus/wellnesspublications.shtml|title=Hugh Downs School of Human Communication&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=asu.edu|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610235556/http://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/aboutus/wellnesspublications.shtml|archivedate=10 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workplace depression can occur in many companies of various size and profession, and can have negative effects on positive profit growth (McTernan, Dollard &amp; LaMontagne, 2013). Stress factors that are unique to one's working environment, such as bullying from co-workers or superiors and poor social support for high pressure occupations, can build over time and create an inefficient work behavior in a depressed individual (Evan-Lack &amp; Knapp, 2014). In addition, inadequate or negative communication techniques can further drive an employee towards feeling of being disconnected from the company's mission and goals (Hidzir, et al., 2017).  One way that companies can combat the destructive consequences associated with employee depression is to offer more support for counseling and consider bringing in experts to educate staff on the consequences of bullying. Ignoring the problem of depression and decreased workplace performance is creating an unsustainable path towards intergroup conflict and lasting feelings of disillusionment (Fischer, et al., 2014).
