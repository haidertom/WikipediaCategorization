===Brawl===
During the post game celebration Memphis players ran towards the BYU sideline to celebrate with their fans sitting behind the BYU bench (due to the bizarre baseball stadium field layout, most of the people in attendance could only sit on the BYU side of the field).  Some bumping and shoving occurred and one Memphis player was pushed in the back by a BYU player that was allegedly also being pushed from behind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i905.photobucket.com/albums/ac257/A380038/shove.jpg Koroma Shoved? 1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdnxfV-CJP8|title=BYU Memphis fight - Koroma's Push|date=22 December 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Memphis player he pushed then turned around and (using both hands) punched/shoved the BYU player in the back of the head.  As the BYU player turned his attention back to the attacker in an apparent attempt to retaliate he threw a punch and he was attacked by 3-4 Memphis players and an all out, bench-clearing brawl ensued.  Punches and kicks were thrown by many players on both sides, one Memphis player even used a helmet as a weapon,&lt;ref&gt;[http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--pHmvoCYV--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/ifswjsayev4vgnugsv16.gif Johnson Uses Helmet in Brawl]&lt;/ref&gt; and when it was over, numerous players walked off the field bloody and bruised.  As the brawl was dying down a BYU player (Kai Nacua) can be seen coming into view and sucker punching a Memphis player (Alan Cross), who was not wearing a helmet, from behind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--e1lvJ4nw--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/dmppvr7h5dqzsulqvt5b.gif Nacua Sucker Punches Cross]&lt;/ref&gt;  As the BYU player turned toward the camera's view, a bloodied bruise could be clearly seen from a punch he received while attempting to defend himself from another Memphis player earlier in the brawl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://s1078.photobucket.com/user/cougarcoug/media/Nacua1_zps9cfoxx5y.gif.html|title=Nacua1_zps9cfoxx5y.gif gif by cougarcoug - Photobucket|work=Photobucket}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aftermath====

Tom Holmoe, BYU's athletic director, apologized to BYU fans stating, "We expect better of our athletes, even in the face of a difficult loss. We intend to fully review this matter. I apologize to Cougar Nation." Memphis said in a statement via AAC commissioner Mike Aresco that they are displeased with the Miami Beach Bowl brawl, and that, "The university will respond accordingly following this detailed review. Needless to say, we are extremely disappointed that this happened, as we expect the highest standard of conduct from our student-athletes." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelerstoday.com/articles/16927/20141225/miami-beach-bowl-brawl-disappoints-aac-commish-school-ads-what.htm|title=Miami Beach Bowl Brawl Disappoints AAC Commish, School Ads, What Started The Fight? [VIDEO]|work=TravelersToday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 20, 2015, The University of Memphis announced the completion of an internal review of the incident and expected punishments to be levied against twelve members of the team.&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;{{cite news |title=Memphis Completes Review of Football Altercation |url=http://www.gotigersgo.com/genrel/012015aaa.html |date=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BYU also took action to punish their players. Kai Nacua, Trey Dye, Sione Takitaki, and Tomasi Laulile were all suspended for BYU's season opener against Nebraska.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1571">In computing, the '''attribute domain''' is the set of [[Value (computer science)|value]]s allowed in an [[Attribute (computing)|attribute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A Guided Tour of Relational Databases and Beyond|first1=Mark|last1=Levene|first2=George|last2=Loizou|publisher=Springer|year=1999|isbn=9781852330088|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CkYpI7QsLlQC&amp;pg=PA72}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example: 
    Rooms in hotel (1-300)
    Age (1-99)
    Married (yes or no)
    Nationality (Nepalese, Indian, American, or British)
    Colors (Red, Yellow, Green)

For the [[relational model]] it is a requirement that each part of a [[tuple]] be atomic.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Database Management Systems|first=Rajesh|last=Narang|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|year=2011|isbn=9788120343139|page=70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4TRuL7nDsj4C&amp;pg=PT89}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The consequence is that each value in the tuple must be of some basic type, like a [[String (computer science)|string]] or an [[integer]]. For the elementary type to be atomic it cannot be broken into more pieces. Alas, the domain is an elementary type, and attribute domain the domain a given attribute belongs to an abstraction belonging to or characteristic of an entity.

For example in SQL ,one can create their own domain for an attribute with the command

  CREATE DOMAIN SSN_TYPE AS CHAR(9) ;

The above command says : "Create a datatype SSN_TYPE that is of character type with size 9 "

The '''Bechdel test''' ({{IPAc-en|'|b|ɛ|k|d|əl}} {{respell|BEK|dəl}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alison Bechdel Audio Name Pronunciation|url=http://www.teachingbooks.net/pronounce.cgi?aid=10597|website=TeachingBooks.net|accessdate=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a measure of the representation of women in fiction. It asks whether a work features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man. The requirement that the two women must be named is sometimes added.&lt;ref name="savigny et al"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Raalte |first1=Christa van |editor1-last=Savigny |editor1-first=Heather |editor2-last=Thorsen |editor2-first=Einar |editor3-last=Jackson |editor3-first=Daniel |editor4-last=Alexander |editor4-first=Jenny |title=Media, Margins and Popular Culture |date=2015 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9781137512819 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Er2hCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT32&amp;pg=PT32 |accessdate=10 June 2018 |language=en |chapter=1.

About half of all films meet these criteria, according to user-edited databases and the media industry press.&lt;!-- Please refer to sources cited below, the lead paragraph cites sources only for quotations --&gt; The test is used as an indicator for the active presence of women in films and other fiction, and to call attention to [[gender inequality in fiction]].

Also known as the '''Bechdel–Wallace test''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alison Bechdel Would Like You to Call It the "Bechdel–Wallace Test," ThankYouVeryMuch|url=http://www.themarysue.com/bechdel-wallace-test-please-alison-bechdel/|accessdate=26 August 2015|date=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is named after the American cartoonist [[Alison Bechdel]], in whose comic strip, ''[[Dykes to Watch Out For]]'', the test first appeared, in 1985. Bechdel credited the idea to a friend, Liz Wallace, and to the writings of [[Virginia Woolf]]. After the test became more widely discussed in the 2000s, a number of variants and tests inspired by it have been introduced.

==History==

===Gender portrayal in popular fiction===
[[File:Female and male characters in film.png|thumb|upright=1.75|Female and male characters in film, according to four studies]]
In her 1929 essay ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'', [[Virginia Woolf]] observed about the literature of her time what the Bechdel test would later highlight in more recent fiction:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bechdel-Test: Frauen spielen keine Rolle|url=http://kurier.at/kultur/4506969-bechdel-test-frauen-spielen-keine-rolle.php|accessdate=19 August 2012|newspaper=[[Kurier]]|date=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|All these relationships between women, I thought, rapidly recalling the splendid gallery of fictitious women, are too simple. ... And I tried to remember any case in the course of my reading where two women are represented as friends. ... They are now and then mothers and daughters. But almost without exception they are shown in their relation to men. It was strange to think that all the great women of fiction were, until [[Jane Austen]]'s day, not only seen by the other sex, but seen only in relation to the other sex. And how small a part of a woman's life is that ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woolf|first=Virginia|title=A Room of One's Own: Chapter 5|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91r/complete.html|work=[[University of Adelaide#North Terrace|The University of Adelaide Library]]|publisher=[[University of Adelaide Press]]|accessdate=24 December 2012|authorlink=Virginia Woolf|editor=Thomas, Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In film, a study of gender portrayals in 855 of the most financially successful U.S. films from 1950 to 2006 showed that there were, on average, two male characters for each female character, a ratio that remained stable over time. Female characters were portrayed as being involved in sex twice as often as male characters, and their proportion of scenes with explicit sexual content increased over time. Violence increased over time in male and female characters alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bleakley | first1 = A. | last2 = Jamieson | first2 = P.

According to a 2014 study by the [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media]], in 120 films made worldwide from 2010 to 2013, only 31% of named characters were female, and 23% of the films had a female protagonist or co-protagonist. 7% of directors were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sakoui|first1=Anousha|last2=Magnusson|first2=Niklas|title='Hunger Games' success masks stubborn gender gap in Hollywood|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-wp-blm-news-bc-film-women22-20140922-story.html|accessdate=22 September 2014|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=22 September 2014}} With reference to: {{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Stacy L.|last2=Pieper|first2=Katherine|title=Gender Bias Without Borders: An Investigation of Female Characters in Popular Films Across 11 Countries|url=http://seejane.org/symposiums-on-gender-in-media/gender-bias-without-borders/|website=See Jane|accessdate=16 April 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study looking at the 700 top‐grossing films from 2007 to 2014 found that only 30% of the speaking characters were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Stacy L.|last2=Choueiti|first2=Marc|last3=Pieper|first3=Katherine|last4=Gillig|first4=Traci|last5=Lee|first5=Carmen|last6=Dylan|first6=DeLuca|title=Inequality in 700 Popular Films: Examining Portrayals of Gender, Race,  &amp; LGBT Status from 2007 to 2014|url=http://annenberg.usc.edu/pages/~/media/MDSCI/Inequality%20in%20700%20Popular%20Films%208215%20Final%20for%20Posting.ashx|publisher=USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2016 analysis of [[screenplay]]s of 2,005 commercially successful films, Hanah Anderson and Matt Daniels found that in 82% of the films, men had two of the top three speaking roles, while a woman had the most dialogue in only 22% of films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Swanson|first1=Ana|title=The problem with almost all movies|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/12/the-problem-with-almost-all-movies/|work=The Washington Post|date=12 April 2016|language=en-US}} With reference to: {{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Hanah|last2=Daniels|first2=Matt|title=The Largest Analysis of Film Dialogue by Gender, Ever|url=http://polygraph.cool/films/|website=Polygraph|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Bechdel test===
[[File:Dykes to Watch Out For (Bechdel test origin).jpg|400px|thumb|A character in ''[[Dykes to Watch Out For]]'' explains the rules that later came to be known as the Bechdel test (1985)]]
The rules now known as the Bechdel test first appeared in 1985 in Alison Bechdel's comic strip ''[[Dykes To Watch Out For]]''. In a strip titled "The Rule", two women, who resemble the future characters Mo and Ginger,&lt;ref name="Martindale"/&gt; discuss seeing a film and one woman explains that she only goes to a movie if it satisfies the following requirements:
# The movie has to have at least two women in it,
# who talk to each other,
# about something besides a man.&lt;ref&gt;Bechdel, Allison. Dykes to Watch Out For. Firebrand Books (October 1, 1986). {{ISBN|978-0932379177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/zizyphus/34585797/in/photostream/ "The Rule" comic page posted on Alison Bechdel's online photostream]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AB&gt;{{cite web|url=https://alisonbechdel.blogspot.com/2005/08/rule.html|title=The Rule|author=Alison Bechdel|date=August 16, 2005|publisher=DTWOF: The Blog|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other woman acknowledges that the idea is pretty strict, but good. Not finding any films that meet their requirements, they go home together.&lt;ref name="Martindale"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martindale|first1=Kathleen|title=Un/Popular Culture: Lesbian Writing After the Sex Wars|date=1997|publisher=State Univ. of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=0791432890|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UO8kUNqHhgQC&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;pg=PA69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The test has also been referred to as the "Bechdel–Wallace test"&lt;ref name="sparqling" /&gt; (which Bechdel herself prefers),&lt;ref&gt;On the [[Fresh Air]] program on NPR on August 17, 2015, in response to a question from host Terry Gross, Bechdel said she would prefer the test be referred to as the Bechdel–Wallace Test.&lt;/ref&gt; the "Bechdel rule",&lt;ref name="ok" /&gt; "Bechdel's law",&lt;ref name="antipope" /&gt; or the "Mo Movie Measure".&lt;ref name=AB/&gt; Bechdel credited the idea for the test to a friend and [[karate]] training partner, Liz Wallace, whose name appears in the [[marquee (sign)|marquee]] of the strip.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94202522 NPR] [[Neda Ulaby|Ulaby, Neda]] "The 'Bechdel Rule,' Defining Pop-Culture Character".

Originally meant as "a little lesbian joke in an alternative feminist newspaper", according to Bechdel,&lt;ref name="San Diego City Beat 23 July 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morlan|first1=Kinsee|title=Comic-Con vs. the Bechdel Test|url=http://www.sdcitybeat.com/sandiego/article-13243-comic-con-vs-the-bechdel-test.html|accessdate=15 August 2014|work=[[San Diego City Beat]]|date=23 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316161800/http://www.sdcitybeat.com/sandiego/article-13243-comic-con-vs-the-bechdel-test.html|archivedate=16 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the test moved into mainstream criticism in the 2010s and has been described as "the standard by which feminist critics judge television, movies, books, and other media".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steiger|first=Kay|editor-first=James|editor-last=Lowder|title=Triumph of The Walking Dead|chapter=No Clean Slate: Unshakeable race and gender politics in ''The Walking Dead''|year=2011|publisher=[[BenBella Books]]|isbn=9781936661138|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lz3fp1fVw90C&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104|accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, an Internet newspaper described it as "almost a household phrase, common shorthand to capture whether a film is woman-friendly".&lt;ref name="The Daily Dot 18 August 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Romano|first=Aja|title=The Mako Mori Test: 'Pacific Rim' inspires a Bechdel Test alternative|url=http://www.dailydot.com/fandom/mako-mori-test-bechdel-pacific-rim/|accessdate=15 September 2013|newspaper=[[The Daily Dot]]|date=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of major Hollywood productions such as ''[[Pacific Rim (film)|Pacific Rim]]'' (2013) to pass the test was addressed in depth in the media.&lt;ref name="Metro 18 July 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=McGuinness|first=Ross|title=The Bechdel test and why Hollywood is a man's, man's, man's world|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/07/18/movie-lovers-hit-back-at-hollywood-misogyny-with-the-bechdel-test-3886103/|accessdate=15 September 2013|newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Neda Ulaby]], the test resonates because "it articulates something often missing in popular culture: not the number of women we see on screen, but the depth of their stories, and the range of their concerns."&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt; Dean Spade and Craig Willse described the test as a "commentary on how media representations enforce harmful [[gender norm]]s" by depicting women's relationships to men more than any other relationships, and women's lives as important only insofar as they relate to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Dean |last1=Spade|first2=Craig |last2=Willse|editor-last=Hawkesworth|editor-first=Mary|title=The Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theory|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199328581|page=556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several variants of the test have been proposed—for example, that the two women must be named characters,&lt;ref name="EW 6 August 2010"/&gt; or that there must be at least a total of 60 seconds of conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministfrequency.com/2012/02/the-2012-oscars-and-the-bechdel-test/ |title=The Oscars and the Bechdel Test |publisher=Feminist Frequency |date=February 15, 2012 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test has also attracted academic interest from a computational analysis approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aclweb.org/anthology/N/N15/N15-1084.pdf Bechdel Test academic paper.]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018, the Bechdel test was added to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Suh |first1=Haley |title=Words To Know By Now: Binge-Watching, Bechdel Test Added To Oxford English Dictionary |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/haleysuh/2018/06/15/words-to-know-by-now-binge-watching-bechdel-test-added-to-oxford-english-dictionary |accessdate=20 June 2018 |work=Forbes |date=15 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in the film industry===
In 2013, four Swedish cinemas and the Scandinavian cable television channel [[Viasat Film]] incorporated the Bechdel test into some of their ratings, a move supported by the [[Swedish Film Institute]].&lt;ref name="G"&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/swedish-cinemas-bechdel-test-films-gender-bias |title=Swedish cinemas take aim at gender bias with Bechdel test rating |work=The Guardian |date=November 6, 2013 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the European cinema fund [[Eurimages]] incorporated the Bechdel test into its submission mechanism as part of an effort to collect information about gender equality in its projects. It requires "a Bechdel analysis of the script to be supplied by the script readers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender equality within Eurimages: current situation and scope for evolution|url=http://www.ewawomen.com/en/eurimages-news.html|website=European Women's Audiovisual Network|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[screenwriting software]] developers began incorporating functions that allow writers to analyze their scripts for gender representation. Software with such functions includes [[Highland 2]], [[WriterDuet]] and the forthcoming [[Final Draft (software)|Final Draft]] 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ryzik |first1=Melena |title=Is your script gender-balanced?

==Application==

In addition to films, the Bechdel test has been applied to other media such as video games&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Kishonna|title=Race, Gender, and Deviance in Xbox Live: Theoretical Perspectives from the Virtual Margins|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317521803|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xh-gBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;pg=PA28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Anthropy |first=Anna |title=Rise of the videogame zinesters: How freaks, normals, amateurs, artists, dreamers, dropouts, queers, housewives, and people like you are taking back an art form |year=2012 |publisher=Seven Stories Press |isbn=9781609803735 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nc3GRXqgPZ8C&amp;lpg=PT7 |edition=Seven Stories Press 1st |accessdate=2014-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Agnello |first=Anthony John |title=Something other than a man: 15 games that pass the Bechdel Test |url=http://gameological.com/2012/07/something-other-than-a-man-15-games-that-pass-the-bechdel-test/ |accessdate=26 July 2012 |work=Gameological |date=July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and comics.&lt;ref name="MTV Geek! 22 February 2012"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zalben |first=Alex |title=''Witchblade''/''Red Sonja #1'' Passes The Bechdel Test |url=http://geek-news.mtv.com/2012/02/22/witchbladered-sonja-1-passes-the-bechdel-test-advance-review/ |accessdate=26 July 2012 |newspaper=[[MTV Geek!]] |date=22 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In theater, British actor Beth Watson launched a "Bechdel Theatre" campaign in 2015 that aims to highlight test-passing plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Jo Caird|title = Does your show pass the Bechdel test? {{!}} Opinion |url = https://www.thestage.co.uk/opinion/2015/does-your-show-pass-the-bechdel-test/|website = The Stage|date=14 October 2015|access-date = 2016-02-05|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pass and fail proportions===
The website ''bechdeltest.com'' is a user-edited database of some 6,500 films classified by whether they pass the test, with the added requirement that the women must be ''named'' characters. {{as of|April 2015}}, it listed 58% of these films as passing all three of the test's requirements, 10% as failing one, 22% as failing two, and 10% as failing all three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Statistics |url=http://bechdeltest.com/statistics/ |work=bechdeltest.com |accessdate=13 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Mark Harris (journalist)|Mark Harris]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', if passing the test were mandatory, it would have jeopardized half of the 2009 [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] nominees.&lt;ref name="EW 6 August 2010"&gt;{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Mark |title=I Am Woman. Hear Me... Please! |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20408121,00.html |accessdate=26 July 2012 |newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=6 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The news website ''[[Vocativ]]'', when subjecting the top-grossing films of 2013 to the Bechdel test, concluded that roughly half of them passed (although some dubiously) and the other half failed.&lt;ref name="Vocativ 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last1= Sharma |first1= Versha |last2= Sender |first2= Hanna |title= Hollywood Movies With Strong Female Roles Make More Money |url= http://www.vocativ.com/culture/celebrity/hollywood-movies-strong-female-roles-make-money/ |accessdate= 2 January 2014 |newspaper= Vocativ |date= 2 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[Charles Stross]] noted that about half of the films that ''do'' pass the test only do so because the women talk about marriage or babies.&lt;ref name="Power 2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Power |first=Nina |title=One-dimensional woman |year=2009 |publisher=Zero Books |isbn=1846942411 |pages=39 et seq. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u3gDWJEJblEC&amp;pg=PA39 |accessdate=2014-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Works that fail the test include some that are mainly about or aimed at women, or which do feature prominent female characters. The television series ''[[Sex and the City]]'' highlights its own failure to pass the test by having one of the four female main characters ask: "How does it happen that four such smart women have nothing to talk about but boyfriends? It's like seventh grade with bank accounts!"&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt;

===Financial aspects===
''Vocativ''{{'}}s authors also found that the films from 2013 that passed the test earned a total of $4.22 billion in the United States, while those that failed earned $2.66 billion in total, leading them to conclude that a way for Hollywood to make more money might be to "put more women onscreen."&lt;ref name="Vocativ 2014"/&gt; A 2014 study by [[FiveThirtyEight]] based on data from about 1,615 films released from 1990 to 2013 concluded that the [[median]] budget of films that passed the test was 35% lower than that of the others. It found that the films that passed the test had about a 37 percent higher [[return on investment]] (ROI) in the United States, and the same ROI internationally, compared to films that did not pass the test.&lt;ref name="538 2014"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper= FiveThirtyEight |first= Walt |last= Hickey |title= The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood's Exclusion of Women |date= 1 April 2014 |url= http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explanations===
Explanations that have been offered as to why many films fail the Bechdel test include the relative lack of gender [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] among scriptwriters&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt; and other movie professionals, also called the "[[celluloid ceiling]]": In 2012, only one in six of the directors, writers, and producers behind the 100 most commercially successful movies in the United States was a woman.&lt;ref name="Metro 18 July 2013" /&gt;

Writing in ''[[National Review]]'' in 2017, film critic [[Kyle Smith]] suggested that the reason for the Bechdel test results was that "Hollywood movies are about people on the extremes of society — cops, criminals, superheroes — [which] tend to be men", and that such films were more often created by men because "women's movie ideas", mostly about relationships according to Smith, "aren't commercial enough for Hollywood studios".&lt;ref name="Smith 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Kyle|title=If You Like Art, Don’t Take the Bechdel Test|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/449340/bechdel-test-feminist-litmus-test-movies-useless-political-correctness|accessdate=18 July 2017|work=National Review|date=10 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered the Bechdel test just as meaningless as a test asking whether a film contained [[cowboy]]s.&lt;ref name="Smith 2017" /&gt; Smith's article provoked vigorous criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gettell|first1=Oliver|title=Conservative Film Critic Slammed for Bechdel Test Takedown|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/07/10/kyle-smith-slammed-bechdel-test-takedown/|accessdate=18 July 2017|work=[[EW.com]]|date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alessandra Maldonado and Liz Bourke wrote that Smith was wrong to contend that female authors do not write books that generate "big movie ideas", citing [[J. K.

== Limitations ==
The Bechdel test only indicates whether women are present in a work of fiction to a certain degree. A work may pass the test and still contain sexist content, and a work with prominent female characters may fail the test.&lt;ref name="ok"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oudaily.com/l_and_a/arts_and_entertainment/column-bechdel-rule-still-applies-to-portrayal-of-women-in/article_d3dc6a7d-8fcb-589c-885a-649fe33db5e1.html |first=Sarah |last=Wilson |date=28 June 2012 |publisher=The Oklahoma Daily |title=Bechdel Rule still applies to portrayal of women in films}}&lt;/ref&gt; A work may fail the test for reasons unrelated to gender bias, such as because its setting works against the inclusion of women (e.g., [[Umberto Eco]]'s ''[[The Name of the Rose (film)|The Name of the Rose]]'', set in a medieval monastery).&lt;ref name="antipope"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stross|first=Charles|title=Bechdel's Law|url=http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2008/07/bechdels_law.html|work=Charlie's Diary|date=28 July 2008|authorlink=Charles Stross|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; What counts as a character or as a conversation is not defined (e.g., the [[Sir Mix-a-Lot]] song "[[Baby Got Back]]" has been described as passing the Bechdel test, because it begins with audio of a [[valley girl]] saying "oh my god, Becky, look at her butt")&lt;ref name=LifehackerDouglas&gt;[https://lifehacker.com/the-bechdel-test-and-other-media-representation-tests-1819324045 The Bechdel Test, and Other Media Representation Tests, Explained], by Nick Douglas, at ''[[Lifehacker]]''; published October 10, 2017; retrieved April 17, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JezebelSimulator&gt;[https://jezebel.com/this-bechdel-test-simulator-shows-how-easy-it-is-to-pre-1753250185 This Bechdel Test Simulator Shows How Easy It Is to Predict Who Makes Sexist Movies (Men)], by Kara Brown, at ''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]''; published January 15, 2016; retrieved April 17, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; and works with very few of either will often fail the test automatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gomez Maureira |first1=M.A.|last2=Rombout|first2=L.E.|editor1-last=Chorianopoulos|editor1-first=Konstantinos|title=Entertainment Computing - ICEC 2015: 14th International Conference, ICEC 2015, Trondheim, Norway, September 29 - October 2, 2015, Proceedings|date=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319245898|page=546|chapter=Sonifying Gender Representation in Film}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt at a [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] analysis of works as to whether they pass the test, at least one researcher, Faith Lawrence, noted that the results depend on how rigorously the test is applied. One of the questions arising from its application is whether a reference to a man at any point within a conversation that also covers other topics invalidates the entire exchange. If not, the question remains how one defines the start and end of a conversation.&lt;ref name="sparqling"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence|first=Faith|title=SPARQLing Conversation: Automating The Bechdel–Wallace Test|url=http://nht.ecs.soton.ac.uk/2011/papers/12-flawrence.pdf|date=June 2011|work=Paper presented at the Narrative and Hypertext Workshop, Hypertext 2011|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In response to its increasing ubiquity in film criticism, the Bechdel test has been criticized for not taking into account the quality of the works it tests (bad films may pass it, and good ones fail), or as a "nefarious plot to make all movies conform to [[feminist]] dogma".&lt;ref name="Zeisler 2016"&gt;{{cite book|title=We Were Feminists Once: From Riot Grrrl to CoverGirl¨, the Buying and Selling of a Political Movement|date=2016|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=9781610395892|pages=55–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Andi Zeisler]], this criticism indicates the problem that the test's utility "has been elevated way beyond the original intention. Where Bechdel and Wallace expressed it as simply a way to point out the rote, unthinkingly normative plotlines of mainstream film, these days passing it has somehow become synonymous with 'being feminist'. It was never meant to be a measure of feminism, but rather a cultural barometer." Zeisler noted that the false assumption that a work that passes the test is "feminist" might lead to creators "gaming the system" by adding just enough women characters and dialogue to pass the test,&lt;ref name="Zeisler 2016" /&gt; while continuing to deny women substantial representation outside of formulaic plots.

Similarly, the ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]'' film critic [[Robbie Collin]] disapproved of the test as prizing "box-ticking and stat-hoarding over analysis and appreciation", and suggested that the underlying problem of the lack of well-drawn female characters in film ought to be a topic of discourse, rather than individual films failing or passing the Bechdel test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collin|first=Robbie|title=Bechdel test is damaging to the way we think about film|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10450463/Bechdel-test-is-damaging-to-the-way-we-think-about-film.html|accessdate=15 November 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''FiveThirtyEight''{{'}}s writer Walt Hickey noted that the test does not measure whether any one film is a model of gender equality, and that passing it does not ensure the quality of writing, significance or depth of female roles—but, he wrote, "it's the best test on gender equity in film we have—and, perhaps more important ..., the only test we have data on".&lt;ref name="538 2014" /&gt;

[[Nina Power]] wrote that the test raises the questions of whether fiction has a duty to represent women (rather than to pursue whatever the creator's own agenda might be) and to be "realistic" in the representation of women. She also wrote that it remained to be determined how often real life passes the Bechdel test, and what the influence of fiction on that might be.&lt;ref name="Power 2009" /&gt;

===Tests about gender and fiction===
The "Mako Mori test", formulated by [[Tumblr]] user "Chaila"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Lena|title=Pacific Rim Inspired the "Mako Mori Test."

The "Sphinx test" by the Sphinx theater company of London asks about the interaction of women with other characters, as well as how prominently women characters feature in the action, how proactive rather than reactive they are, and whether they are portrayed stereotypically. It was conceived to "encourage theatremakers to think about how to write more and better roles for women", in reaction to research indicating that only 37% of theater roles were written for women {{as of|2014|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Snow|first1=Georgia|title=Theatre gets its own Bechdel Test|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2015/theatre-gets-its-own-bechdel-test/|accessdate=6 December 2015|work=[[The Stage]]|date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tests about characteristics other than gender===

====Sexuality====
The "[[Vito Russo]] test" created by the [[LGBT]] organization [[GLAAD]] tests for the representation of LGBT characters in films. It asks: Does the film contain a character that is identifiably LGBT, and is not solely or predominantly defined by their sexual orientation or gender identity, as well as tied into the plot in such a way that their removal would have a significant effect?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GLAAD introduces 'Studio Responsibility Index', report on LGBT images in films released by 'Big Six' studios |url=http://www.glaad.org/releases/glaad-introduces-studio-responsibility-index-report-lgbt-images-films-released-big-six |date=August 20, 2013 |publisher=[[GLAAD]] |accessdate=August 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Atlantic 21 August 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=John|first=Arit|title=Beyond the Bechdel Test: Two (New) Ways of Looking at Movies|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2013/08/beyond-bechdel-test-two-new-ways-looking-movies/68563/|accessdate=15 September 2013|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====People of color====
A test proposed by TV critic Eric Deggans asks whether a film that is not about race has at least two non-white characters in the main cast,&lt;ref name="Zeisler 2016" /&gt; and similarly, writer Nikesh Shukla proposed a test about whether there are two main characters who are [[people of color]], who talk to each other without mentioning their race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shukla|first1=Nikesh|title=After the Bechdel Test, I propose the Shukla Test for race in film|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/10/after-bechdel-test-i-propose-shukla-test-race-film|accessdate=22 November 2016|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dawn|first1=Randee|title=Gender and race issues are slowly fading as more filmmakers consider three key tests|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-en-mn-1117-film-tests-20161011-snap-20161109-story.html|accessdate=22 November 2016|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[New York Times]]'' film critic [[Manohla Dargis]] suggested in January 2016 the "DuVernay test", (named for director [[Ava DuVernay]]) asking whether "African-Americans and other minorities have fully realized lives rather than serve as scenery in white stories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dargis|first1=Manohla|title=Sundance Fights Tide With Films Like ‘The Birth of a Nation’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/30/movies/sundance-fights-tide-with-films-like-the-birth-of-a-nation.html|accessdate=4 February 2018|work=The New York Times|date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to point out the lack of people of color in [[Hollywood]] [[movie]]s, through a measure of their importance to a particular movie or the lack of a gratuitous link to white actors.&lt;ref name="2016-02-01_TC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2016/02/could-this-be-the-bechdel-test-for-race.html|title=Could This Be the Bechdel Test for Race|accessdate=February 4, 2018|last=Evans|first=Dayna|date=February 1, 2016|work=The Cut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nadia Latif and Leila Latif of ''[[The Guardian]]'' have suggested a series of five questions:
* Are there two named characters of color?
* Do they have dialogue?
* Are they not romantically involved with one another?
* Do they have any dialogue that isn't comforting or supporting a white character?
* Is one of them definitely not [[Magical Negro|magic]]?&lt;ref name="2016-01-19_NL-LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/18/hollywoods-race-problem-film-industry-actors-of-colour|title=How to fix Hollywood's race problem|accessdate=June 20, 2017|last1=Latif|last2=Latif|first1=Nadia|first2=Leila|date=January 18, 2016|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simplified version by Nikesh Shukla, already proposed in 2013, asks if "two ethnic minorities talk to each other for more than five minutes about something other than race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shukla|first=Nikesh|title=After the Bechdel Test, I propose the Shukla Test for race in film|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/10/after-bechdel-test-i-propose-shukla-test-race-film|accessdate=November 22, 2016|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tests about nonfiction===
The Bechdel test has also inspired gender-related tests for nonfiction. Laurie Voss, [[Chief technology officer|CTO]] of [[npm (software)|npm]], proposed a Bechdel test for software. [[Source code]] passes this test if it contains a function written by a woman developer which calls a function written by a different woman developer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |user=seldo |author=Laurie Voss |number=571453200093437952 |date=27 Feb 2015 |title=Does your project pass the Bechdel test?

The Bechdel test also inspired the [[Finkbeiner test]], a checklist to help journalists to avoid gender bias in articles about [[women in science]].&lt;ref name="CJR 22 March 2013"&gt;{{cite news |last=Brainard |first=Curtis |title='The Finkbeiner Test' Seven rules to avoid gratuitous gender profiles of female scientists |url=http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/finkbeiner_test_gender_gap_fem.php?page=all |accessdate=31 March 2013 |newspaper=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |date=22 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{no footnotes|date=March 2013}}
The '''Boehm system''' is a system of [[key (instrument)|keywork]] for the [[flute]], created by [[inventor]] and [[flautist]] [[Theobald Boehm]] between 1831 and 1847.  

Prior to the development of the Boehm system, flutes were most commonly made of wood, with an inverse conical [[bore (wind instruments)|bore]], eight keys, and [[tone hole]]s (the openings where the fingers are placed to produce specific notes) that were small in size, and thus easily covered by the fingertips.  Boehm's work was inspired by an 1831 concert in London, given by soloist [[Charles Nicholson (flautist)|Charles Nicholson]] who, with his father in the 1820s, had introduced a flute constructed with larger tone holes than were used in previous designs.  This large-holed instrument could produce greater volume of sound than other flutes, and Boehm set out to produce his own large-holed design.

In addition to large holes, Boehm provided his flute with "full venting", meaning that all keys were normally open (previously, several keys were normally closed, and opened only when the key was operated).  Boehm also wanted to locate tone holes at acoustically optimal points on the body of the instrument, rather than locations conveniently covered by the player's fingers.  To achieve these goals, Boehm adapted a system of axle-mounted keys with a series of "open rings" (called ''brille'', German for "eyeglasses", as they resembled the type of eyeglass frames common during the 19th century) that were fitted around other tone holes, such that the closure of one tone hole by a finger would also close a key placed over a second hole.

In 1832 Boehm introduced a new conical-bore flute, which achieved a fair degree of success.  Boehm, however, continued to look for ways to improve the instrument.  Finding that an increased volume of air produced a stronger and clearer tone, he replaced the conical bore with a cylindrical bore, finding that a parabolic contraction of the bore near the [[embouchure]] hole improved the instrument's [[Register (music)|low register]].  He also found that optimal tone was produced when the tone holes were too large to be covered by the fingertips, and he developed a system of finger plates to cover the holes.  These new flutes were at first made of [[silver]], although Boehm later produced wooden versions.  

The cylindrical Boehm flute was introduced in 1847, with the instrument gradually being adopted almost universally by professional and amateur players in Europe and around the world during the second half of the 19th century. The instrument was adopted for the performance of orchestral and chamber music, opera and theater, wind ensembles (e.g., military and civic bands), and most other music which might be loosely described as relating to "[[Western classical music]]" (including, for example, [[jazz]]). Many further refinements have been made, and countless design variations are common among flutes today (the "offset G" key, addition of the low B foot, etc.) The concepts of the Boehm system have been applied across the range of flutes available, including [[piccolo]]s, [[alto flute]]s, [[bass flute]]s, and so on, as well as other wind instruments. The material of the instrument may vary (many piccolos are made of wood, some very large flutes are wooden or even made of [[PVC]]).

The [[flute]] is perhaps the oldest musical instrument, other than the human voice itself. There are very many flutes, both traversely blown and end-blown "[[fipple]]" flutes, currently produced which are not built on the Boehm model.

The fingering system for the [[saxophone]] closely resembles the Boehm system. A key system inspired by Boehm's for the [[clarinet]] family is also known as the "[[Boehm system (clarinet)|Boehm system]]", although it was developed by [[Hyacinthe Klosé]] and not Boehm himself.  The Boehm system was also adapted for a small number of [[flageolet]]s. Boehm did work on a system for the [[bassoon]], and Boehm-inspired [[oboe]]s have been made, but non-Boehm systems remain predominant for these instruments. The [[Albert system]] is another key system for the clarinet.

A '''Community Fridge''' is a [[refrigerator]] (colloquially "fridge") located in a [[public space]]. It enables food to be shared within a community,  anyone can put food in and anyone can take food out.  The main aim of Community Fridges is to reduce [[food waste]]. They also enable people facing hardship to have easy access to fresh, nutritious food. Community Fridges are normally social spaces that enable people to connect to their communities. Some Community Fridges also have an associated area for non-perishable food.

[[File:Community fridge in church alcove in Botley UK.jpg|thumb|A community fridge in a church alcove in Botley (UK) with bread box on top and blue box of nonperishables on the chair]]
The first Community Fridges were set up in Germany&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foodsharing.de&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012 and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/25/solidarity-fridge-spanish-town-cut-food-waste-galdakao|title=The solidarity fridge: Spanish town's cool way to cut food waste|first=Ashifa|last=Kassam|date=25 June 2015|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, early Community Fridges were set up at Frome,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edventurefrome.org/enterprises-initiatives/fridge/|title=Community Fridge Frome - Edventure : Frome|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Derbyshire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sdcvs.wordpress.com/2016/10/24/swadlincotes-community-fridge/|title=Swadlincote’s Community Fridge|date=24 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brixton (London),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/community-fridge-food-waste-cut-brixton-open-south-london-lambeth-peoples-fridge-a7583821.html|title=A community fridge has opened in London to make sure food isn't going to waste|date=16 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Botley (Oxford).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foodforcharities.wordpress.com/botley/|title=Botley community fridge|date=30 September 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A national network of Community Fridges was set up in July 2017 by the environmental charity Hubbub UK, which offers a free support service to new projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resource.co/article/community-fridge-network-bring-social-value-food-waste-fight-11989|title=Community Fridge Network to bring social value to food waste fight|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community Fridges are a rapidly-growing phenomenon, with fridges also recently set up in India&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-this-community-fridge-in-versova-makes-sure-no-one-goes-hungry-2412412|title=This community fridge in Versova makes sure no one goes hungry - Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=23 April 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lovefoodhatewaste.co.nz/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-community-fridge/|title=Everything you need to know about Auckland's Community Fridge|date=23 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

Issues surrounding Community Fridges include ensuring that they are kept clean, ensuring that the food is [[food safety|safe]], and making sure that they are not abused (e.g. that nobody profits from the food). For instance, in the UK, setting up a Community Fridge requires a rota of volunteers to clean the fridge and check on the food; [[Liability_insurance#Public_liability|public liability insurance]]; the support of the local authority [[environmental health officer]]; and obviously a fridge and associated waste bins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foodforcharities.wordpress.com/category/botley-community-fridge/|title=Botley community fridge -|website=foodforcharities.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several community fridges in Germany were threatened with closure because of health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.citylab.com/equity/2016/02/berlin-public-refridgerator-food-sharing-germany/462633/|title=Berlin's Public Refrigerators Were Just Declared a Health Hazard|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3945">'''Compartmentalization''' is a subconscious [[defence mechanism|psychological defense mechanism]] used to avoid [[cognitive dissonance]], or the mental discomfort and anxiety caused by a person's having conflicting values, cognitions, emotions, beliefs, etc. within themselves.  

Compartmentalization allows these conflicting ideas to co-exist by inhibiting direct or explicit acknowledgement and interaction between separate compartmentalized self-states.&lt;ref name=Tangney58-61&gt;{{cite book|author=Tangney|editors=Leary, Mark R. Leary and Price, June |title=Handbook of self and identity|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-4625-0305-6|pages=58–61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vafgWfgxUK8C&amp;pg=PA58}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Psychoanalytic views==

[[Psychoanalysis]] considers that whereas [[Isolation (psychology)|isolation]] separates thoughts from feeling, compartmentalization separates different (incompatible) cognitions from each other.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nancy McWilliams]], ''Psychoanalytic Diagnosis'' (2011) p. 135-6&lt;/ref&gt; As a secondary, intellectual defense, it may be linked to [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]].&lt;ref&gt;McWilliams, p. 200 and p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; It is also related to the phenomenon of neurotic typing, whereby everything must be classified into mutually exclusive and watertight categories.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Otto Kernberg]] has used the term "bridging interventions" for the therapist's attempts to straddle and contain contradictory and compartmentalized components of the patient's mind.&lt;ref&gt;Salman Akhtar, ''Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (2009) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vulnerability==

Compartmentalization may lead to hidden [[vulnerabilities]] in those who use it as a major defense mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Reich et al, ''Handbook of Adult Resilience'' (2012) p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

Those suffering from [[borderline personality disorder]] will often divide people into all good versus all bad, to avoid the conflicts removing the compartments would inevitably bring, using [[denial]] or indifference to protect against any indications of contradictory evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Glen O. Gabbard|Gabbard, Glen O.]]|title=Long-Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy|location=London|year= 2010|ISBN=978-1-58562-144-6 |pages=34–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using indifference towards a better viewpoint is a normal and common example of this. It can be caused by someone having used multiple compartment ideals and having been uncomfortable with modifying them, at risk of being found incorrect. This often causes [[Double standard|double-standards]], and [[bias]].{{cn|date=October 2012}}

==Social identity==

Conflicting social identities may be dealt with by compartmentalizing them and dealing with each only in a context-dependent way.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Crisp, ''The Psychology of Social and Cultural Diversity'' (2011)  p. 16 and p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==

In his novel, ''[[The Human Factor (Graham Greene book)|The Human Factor]]'', [[Graham Greene]] has one of his corrupt officials use the rectangular boxes of [[Ben Nicholson]]'s art as a guide to avoiding moral responsibility for bureaucratic decision-making—a way to compartmentalize oneself within one's own separately colored box.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

[[Doris Lessing]] considered that the essential theme of ''[[The Golden Notebook]]'' was "that we must not divide things off, must not compartmentalise. 'Bound. Free. Good. Bad. Yes. No. Capitalism. Socialism. Sex. Love...'".&lt;ref&gt;Doris Lessing, ''The Golden Notebook'' (1973) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Complex systems biology''' ('''CSB''') is a branch or subfield of [[mathematical and theoretical biology]] concerned with [[complexity]] of both structure and function in biological organisms, as well as the emergence and evolution of organisms and species, with emphasis  being placed on the [[interconnectivity|complex interactions]] of, and within, [[Biological network inference|bionetworks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sprites, P |author2=Glymour, C |author3=Scheines, R |year=2000 |title= Causation, Prediction, and Search: Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning |edition=2nd |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the fundamental relations and [[Relational algebra|relational patterns]] that are essential to life.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Snooks, Graeme, "A general theory of complex living systems: Exploring the demand side of dynamics", ''Complexity'', vol. 13, no. 6, July/August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonner"&gt;Bonner, J.

==Complexity of organisms and biosphere==
A complete definition of [[complexity]] for individual organisms, species, ecosystems, biological evolution and the biosphere has eluded researchers, and still is an ongoing issue.&lt;ref name="Bonner" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heylighen, Francis (2008). "Complexity and Self-Organization". In Bates, Marcia J.; Maack, Mary Niles. Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences. CRC. {{ISBN|978-0-8493-9712-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Seawifs global biosphere.jpg|thumb|right]]

Most [[complex system]] models are often formulated in terms of concepts drawn from statistical physics, information theory and non-linear dynamics; however, such approaches are not focused on, or do not include,  the conceptual part of complexity related to organization and topological attributes or algebraic topology, such as network connectivity of genomes, interactomes and biological organisms that are very important.&lt;ref name="Rosen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;^ Heylighen, Francis (2008). "Complexity and Self-Organization". In Bates, Marcia J.; Maack, Mary Niles. Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences. CRC. {{ISBN|978-0-8493-9712-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"abstract relational biology (ARB)". PlanetPhysics. Retrieved 2010-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the two complementary approaches based both on [[information theory]], [[network topology]]/[[graph theory|abstract graph theory]] concepts are being combined for example in the fields of [[neuroscience]] and [[cognition|human cognition]].&lt;ref name="springerlink" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hdl.handle.net/10101/npre.2011.6115.1 Wallace, Rodrick. When Spandrels Become Arches: Neural crosstalk and the evolution of consciousness. Available from Nature Precedings  (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally agreed that there is a [[hierarchy]] of complexity levels of organization that should be considered as distinct from that of the levels of reality in [[ontology]].&lt;ref name="springerlink" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Poli R | year = 2001a | title = The Basic Problem of the Theory of Levels of Reality | url = | journal = Axiomathes | volume = 12 | issue = 3–4| pages = 261–283 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Poli R | year = 1998 | title = Levels | url = | journal = Axiomathes | volume = 9 | issue = 1–2| pages = 197–211 | doi=10.1007/bf02681712| pmid = 8053082 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hierarchy of complexity levels of organization in the biosphere is also recognized in modern classifications
of taxonomic ranks, such as: [[domain (biology)|biological domain]] and biosphere, [[Kingdom (biology)|biological kingdom]], [[Phylum]], [[Class (biology)|biological class]], [[Order (biology)|order]], [[Family (biology)|family]], [[genus]] and [[species]]. Because of their dynamic and composition variability, intrinsic "fuzziness",  autopoietic attributes, ability to self-reproduce, and so on, organisms do not fit into the 'standard' definition of general systems, and they are therefore 'super-complex' in both their function and structure; organisms can be thus be defined in CSB only as '[[meta-system]]s' of simpler dynamic systems&lt;ref name="springerlink" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/MST.html Metasystem Transition Theory], [[Valentin Turchin]], [[Cliff Joslyn]], 1993-1997&lt;/ref&gt; Such a meta-system definition of organisms, species, 'ecosystems', and so on, is  not equivalent to the definition of a ''system of systems'' as in [[Autopoiesis|Autopoietic System]]s Theory,;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archonic.net Reflexive Autopoietic Systems Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; it also differs from the definition proposed for example by K.D. Palmer in meta-system engineering,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archonic.net/incosewg/ppframe.htm Meta-system Engineering], Kent D. Palmer, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; organisms being quite different from machines and [[Automata theory|automata]] with fixed input-output transition functions, or a continuous [[dynamical system]] with fixed [[phase space]],&lt;ref&gt;Hoff, M.A., Roggia, K.G., Menezes, P.B.:(2004). Composition of Transformations: A
Framework for Systems with Dynamic Topology. ''International Journal of Computing Anticipatory System's'' 14:259–270&lt;/ref&gt; contrary to the Cartesian philosophical thinking; thus, organisms cannot be defined merely in terms of a quintuple ''A'' of ''(states, startup state, input and output sets/alphabet, transition function)'',&lt;ref&gt;[[John E. Hopcroft]], [[Rajeev Motwani]], [[Jeffrey D. Ullman]].2000. [[Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation]] (2nd Edition)Pearson Education. {{ISBN|0-201-44124-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; although 'non-deterministic automata', as well as 'fuzzy automata' have also been defined. Tessellation or [[cellular automaton|cellular automata]] provide however an intuitive, visual/computational insight into the lower levels of complexity, and have therefore become an increasingly popular, discrete model studied in computability theory, applied mathematics, physics, computer science, theoretical biology/systems biology, cancer simulations and microstructure modeling.

A '''continual improvement process''', also often called a '''continuous improvement process''' (abbreviated as '''CIP''' or '''CI'''), is an ongoing effort to improve products, services, or processes. These efforts can seek "[[incrementalism|incremental]]" improvement over time or "breakthrough" improvement all at once.&lt;ref&gt;ASQ: Learn About Quality &amp;#x2014; http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/continuous-improvement/overview/overview.html&lt;/ref&gt; Delivery (customer valued) processes are constantly evaluated and improved in the light of their efficiency, effectiveness and flexibility.

Some see CIPs as a meta-process for most management systems (such as [[business process management]], [[quality management]], [[project management]], and [[program management]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://flevy.com/operational-excellence | title=Operational Excellence | publisher=Flevy | accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. Edwards Deming]], a pioneer of the field, saw it as part of the 'system' whereby feedback from the process and customer were evaluated against organisational goals. The fact that it can be called a management process does not mean that it needs to be executed by 'management'; but rather merely that it makes decisions about the implementation of the delivery process and the design of the delivery process itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/continuous-improvement/overview/overview.html | title=Continuous Improvement | publisher=American Society for Quality | accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A broader definition is that of the [[Institute of Quality Assurance]] who defined "continuous improvement as a gradual never-ending change which is: '... focused on increasing the effectiveness and/or efficiency of an organisation to fulfil its policy and objectives. It is not limited to quality initiatives. Improvement in business strategy, business results, customer, employee and supplier relationships can be subject to continual improvement. Put simply, it means ‘getting better all the time’.' "&lt;ref name=FryerAntonyDouglas&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.filekadeh.ir/wp-content/uploads/edd/2014/02/2.pdf |title=Critical success factors of continuous improvement in the public sector: A literature review and some key findings |last1=Fryer |first1=Karen J. |last2=Antony |first2=Jiju |last3=Douglas |first3=Alex |journal=Total Quality Management |volume=19 |number=5 |pages=497–517 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|498}}

==Kaizen==
Some successful implementations use the approach known as [[kaizen]] (the translation of kai (“change”) zen (“good”) is “improvement”). This method became famous from [[Masaaki Imai|Imai]]'s 1986 book ''Kaizen: The Key to Japan's Competitive Success.''&lt;ref name = kaizen-1986 /&gt;
* Feedback: The core principle of CIP is the (self) reflection of processes.
* Efficiency: The purpose of CIP is the identification, reduction, and elimination of suboptimal processes. 
* Evolution: The emphasis of CIP is on incremental, continual steps rather than giant leaps.

Key features of kaizen include:
* Improvements are based on many small changes rather than the radical changes that might arise from Research and Development
* As the ideas come from the workers themselves, they are less likely to be radically different, and therefore easier to implement
* Small improvements are less likely to require major capital investment than major process changes
* The ideas come from the talents of the existing workforce, as opposed to using research, consultants or equipment – any of which could be very expensive
* All employees should continually be seeking ways to improve their own performance
* It helps encourage workers to take ownership for their work, and can help reinforce team working, thereby improving worker motivation.

The elements above are the more tactical elements of CIP. The more strategic elements include deciding how to increase the value of the delivery process output to the customer (effectiveness) and how much flexibility is valuable in the process to meet changing needs.&lt;ref name = kaizen-1986&gt;{{cite book | last=Imai | first=Masaaki | year=1986 | title = Kaizen: The Key to Japan's Competitive Success | publisher=McGraw-Hill/Irwin | ISBN=0-07-554332-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Imai | first=Masaaki | year = 1997 | title=Gemba Kaizen: A Commonsense, Low-Cost Approach to Management | edition = 1st  | publisher=McGraw-Hill |ISBN = 0-07-031446-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In environmental management==
The CIP-concept is also used in [[Environmental management system|environmental management systems (EMS)]], such as [[ISO 14000]] and [[Eco-Management and Audit Scheme|EMAS]].  The term "continual improvement", not "continuous improvement", is used in [[ISO 14000]], and is understood to refer to an ongoing series of small or large-scale improvements which are each done discretely, i.e. in a step-wise fashion.  Several differences exist between the CIP concept as it is applied in quality management and environmental management.  CIP in EMS aims to improve the natural consequences of products and activities, not the products and activities as such.  Secondly, there is no client-orientation in EMS-related CIP.  Also, CIP in EMS is not limited to small, incremental improvements as in [[Kaizen]], it also includes innovations of any scale.&lt;ref&gt;Gastl, René: [http://www.envirocip.com/downloadables/summary-of-basic-cip-concept.html CIP in Environmental Management] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212193340/http://www.envirocip.com/downloadables/summary-of-basic-cip-concept.html |date=2011-02-12 }}, an Abstract of Gastl, René: Kontinuierliche Verbesserung im Umweltmanagement, 2nd Ed, 2009, vdf, Zurich&lt;/ref&gt;

==ISO change from "continuous" to "continual"==
In the late 1990s, the developers of the [[ISO 9000|ISO 9001:2000]] standard—which addressed quality management systems and principles—debated whether or not to update the use of the word "continuous" to "continual".&lt;ref name="RussellContinual03"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qualitywbt.org/FlexTraining/ASP/content/sections/A12/pdfs/01al-vs-ous.pdf |format=PDF |title=Continual Improvement Auditing |author=Russel, J.P. |date=2003 |accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MasséContinuous14"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lean.org/FuseTalk/Forum/messageview.cfm?catid=45&amp;threadid=7018 |title=Continuous vs Continual |author=Massé, K. |publisher=Lean Enterprise Institute |date=3 April 2014 |accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HycomTerms"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hycom.in/terms_conc.html |title=Why does ISO 9001 use 'continual' improvement vs 'continuous' improvement? |work=Terms &amp; Concepts |publisher=Hycom Solutions |accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ISO/TC 176|ISO Technical Committee 176]] and regulatory representatives ultimately decided that "continuous was unenforceable because it meant an organization had to improve minute by minute, whereas, continual improvement meant step-wise improvement or improvement in segments".&lt;ref name="RussellContinual03" /&gt; The committee reportedly did not base the change on dictionary definitions or the standard's vocabulary.&lt;ref name="RussellContinual03" /&gt; This change ran contrary to the common usage of "continuous" in the standard and other prior business management documentation.&lt;ref name="MasséContinuous14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCTSTheContin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcts.com/Continual-vs-Continuous.htm |title=The Continual Improvement vs. Continuous Improvement Dilemma... |publisher=Management Coaching &amp; Training Services |accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kepler-Bruno.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Figure 'M' (for Latin ''Mundus'') from [[Johannes Kepler]]'s 1617–1621 ''[[Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae]]'', showing the [[Earth]] as belonging to just one of any number of similar stars.]]
In [[physical cosmology]], the '''Copernican principle''' is an alternative name for the  [[principle of relativity]], stating that humans, on the [[Earth]] or in the [[Solar system]], are not privileged observers of the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Peacock |first=John A. | title =  Cosmological Physics | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | page = 66 | year = 1998 |isbn= 0-521-42270-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Named for [[Copernican heliocentrism]], it is a working assumption that arises from a modified cosmological extension of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus's]] argument of a moving Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bondi |first=Hermann| authorlink = Hermann Bondi | title = Cosmology | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1952 | pages = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some sense, it is equivalent to the [[mediocrity principle]].

== Origin and implications ==

[[Hermann Bondi]] named the principle after Copernicus in the mid-20th century, although the principle itself dates back to the 16th-17th century [[paradigm shift]] away from the [[Ptolemaic system]], which placed [[Earth]] at the center of the [[universe]]. Copernicus proposed that the motion of the planets can be explained by reference to an assumption that the Sun and not Earth is centrally located and stationary. He argued that the [[apparent retrograde motion]] of the planets is an illusion caused by Earth's movement around the [[Sun]], which the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican model]] placed at the centre of the universe. Copernicus himself was mainly motivated by technical dissatisfaction with the earlier system and not by support for any mediocrity principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhn |first= Thomas S. | authorlink = Thomas Kuhn | title = The Copernican Revolution: Planetary Astronomy in the Development of Western Thought | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] |year=1957 | isbn=978-0-674-17103-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, although the Copernican heliocentric model is often described as "demoting" Earth from its central role it had in the Ptolemaic geocentric model, it was successors to Copernicus, notably the 16th century [[Giordano Bruno]] who adopted this new perspective. The earth's central position had been interpreted as being in the "lowest and filthiest parts". Instead, as Galileo said, the earth is part of the "dance of the stars" rather than the "sump where the universe's filth and ephemera collect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/scientificamerican0301-24a |journal= Scientific American |year=2001 |volume=284 |issue=3 |pages=24 |title= Copernican Counterrevolution |authorlink= George Musser |last=Musser |first=George  |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=in-brief-2001-03|bibcode = 2001SciAm.284c..24M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1511/2009.76.50 |journal= American Scientist |year=2009 |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=50–57 |title= The Bones of Copernicus |first= Dennis |last=Danielson }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 20th Century, Carl Sagan asked, "Who are we? We find that we live on an insignificant planet of a humdrum star lost in a galaxy tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which there are far more galaxies than people."&lt;ref&gt;Sagan C, Cosmos (1980) p.193&lt;/ref&gt;

In cosmology, if one assumes the Copernican principle and observes that the universe appears [[Isotropy|isotropic]] or the same in all directions from our vantage point on Earth, then one can infer that the universe is generally [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] or the same everywhere (at any given time) and is also isotropic about any given point. These two conditions make up the [[cosmological principle]].&lt;ref name="RowanRobinson1996" /&gt; In practice, astronomers observe that the universe has [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] or non-uniform structures up to the scale of [[galactic supercluster]]s, [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] and [[Void (astronomy)|great void]]s. It becomes more and more homogeneous and isotropic when observed on larger and larger scales, with little detectable structure on scales of more than about 200 million [[parsec]]s. However, on scales comparable to the radius of the observable universe, we see systematic changes with distance from Earth. For instance, galaxies contain more young stars and are less clustered, and [[quasars]] appear more numerous. While this might suggest that Earth is at the center of the universe, the Copernican principle requires us to interpret it as evidence for the evolution of the universe with time: this distant light has taken most of the age of the universe to reach us and show us the universe when it was young. The most distant light of all, [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], is isotropic to at least one part in a thousand.

Modern mathematical cosmology is based on the assumption that the Cosmological principle is almost, but not exactly, true on the largest scales. The Copernican principle represents the irreducible philosophical assumption needed to justify this, when combined with the observations.

[[Michael Rowan-Robinson]] emphasizes the Copernican principle as the threshold test for modern thought, asserting that: "It is evident that in the post-Copernican era of human history, no well-informed and rational person can imagine that the Earth occupies a unique position in the universe."&lt;ref name="RowanRobinson1996"&gt;{{cite book | last=Rowan-Robinson |first=Michael  |authorlink=Michael Rowan-Robinson | title = Cosmology| edition = 3rd | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | pages = 62–63  |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-19-851884-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bondi and [[Thomas Gold]] used the Copernican principle to argue for the [[perfect cosmological principle]] which maintains that the universe is also homogeneous in time, and is the basis for the [[steady-state cosmology]].&lt;ref name="BondiGold1948"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bondi|first=H.|author2=Gold, T.|title=The Steady-State Theory of the Expanding Universe|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|year=1948|volume=108|issue=3|pages=252–270|bibcode=1948MNRAS.108..252B|doi=10.1093/mnras/108.3.252}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this strongly conflicts with the evidence for cosmological evolution mentioned earlier:  the universe has progressed from extremely different conditions at the [[Big Bang]], and will continue to progress toward extremely different conditions, particularly under the rising influence of [[dark energy]], apparently toward the [[Big Freeze]] or [[Big Rip]].

Since the 1990s the term has been used (interchangeably with "the Copernicus method") for [[J. Richard Gott]]'s [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian-inference]]-based prediction of duration of ongoing events, a generalized version of the [[Doomsday argument]].{{clarify|date=April 2017}}

==Tests of the principle==
The Copernican principle has never been proven, and in the most general sense cannot be proven, but it is implicit in many modern theories of physics.  Cosmological models are often derived with reference to the [[Cosmological principle]], slightly more general than the Copernican principle, and many tests of these models can be considered tests of the Copernican principle.&lt;ref name=clarkson&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Clarkson | first1 = C. | last2 = Bassett | first2 = B. | last3 = Lu | first3 = T. | title = A General Test of the Copernican Principle | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.011301 | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 101 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0712.3457 |bibcode = 2008PhRvL.101a1301C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
Before the term Copernican principle was even coined, Earth was repeatedly shown not to have any special location in the universe. The [[Copernican Revolution]] dethroned Earth to just one of many planets orbiting the Sun. [[Proper motion]] was mentioned by Halley. [[William Herschel]] found that the Solar System is moving through space within our disk-shaped [[Milky Way]] galaxy. [[Edwin Hubble]] showed that our galaxy is just one of many galaxies in the universe. Examination of our galaxy's position and motion in the universe led to the [[Big Bang|Big Bang theory]] and the whole of modern [[cosmology]].

===Modern tests===

==Physics without the principle==
The standard model of cosmology, the [[Lambda-CDM model]], assumes the Copernican principle and the more general [[Cosmological principle]] and observations are largely consistent but there are always [[Unsolved problems in physics#Astronomy and astrophysics|unsolved problems]].  Some cosmologists and theoretical physicists design models lacking the Cosmological or Copernican principles, to constrain the valid values of observational results, to address specific known issues, and to propose tests to distinguish between current models and other possible models.

A prominent example in this context is the observed [[accelerating universe]] and the [[cosmological constant]] issue.  An alternative proposal to [[dark energy]] is that the universe is much more inhomogeneous than currently assumed, and specifically that we are in an extremely large low-density void.&lt;ref name=void&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = February | first1 = S. | last2 = Larena | first2 = J. | last3 = Smith | first3 = M. | last4 = Clarkson | first4 = C. | title = Rendering dark energy void | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16627.x | journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | pages = no | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0909.1479 |bibcode = 2010MNRAS.405.2231F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To match observations we would have to be very close to the centre of this void, immediately contradicting the Copernican principle.

{{Western Buddhism}}
In [[Zen|Zen-Buddhism]], '''Dharma transmission''' is a custom in which a person is established as a "successor in an unbroken [[Lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of teachers and disciples, a spiritual 'bloodline' (''[[kechimyaku]]'') theoretically traced back to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] himself."&lt;ref name="Haskel, 2"&gt;Haskel, 2&lt;/ref&gt; The dharma lineage reflects the importance of family-structures in ancient China, and forms a symbolic and [[ritual]] recreation of this system for the monastical "family".{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=264}}

In [[Rinzai school|Rinzai-Zen]], ''inka shōmei'' is ideally "the formal recognition of Zen's deepest realisation",{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=54}} but practically it is being used for the transmission of the "true lineage" of the masters (''shike'') of the training halls.{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=13}} There are only about fifty&lt;ref name=Antaiji10 group=web /&gt; to eighty&lt;ref group=web name="Buddhadharma"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://archive.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2002/winter/dictionary-roshi_winter02.htm |title=Buddhadharma, Dharma Dictionary, ''Roshi'' |access-date=2012-12-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204133920/http://archive.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2002/winter/dictionary-roshi_winter02.htm |archive-date=2012-12-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of such ''inka shōmei''-bearers in Japan.

In [[Sōtō|Sōtō-Zen]], dharma transmission (shiho) provides access to only a relatively low grade. It is listed as a requirement for the very lowest ecclesiastical status, that of an instructor third class (''[[Zen ranks and hierarchy|santō kyōshi]]''){{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=276}} further training is required to become an [[oshō]].&lt;ref name =Antaiji2 group=web /&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Chinese Chán|Bodhidharma}}

The notion and practice of Dharma Transmission developed early in the history of Chán, as a means to gain credibility{{sfn|McRae|2003}} and to foster institutional ties among the members of the Chán-community.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008}} Charts of dharma-lineages were developed, which represented the continuity of the Buddhist dharma. Originally these lineages only included the Chinese Patriarchs, but they were later extended to twenty-eight Indian Patriarchs and seven Buddhas.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005}}

===Chán lineage===
{{See also|Zen lineage charts}}

The Chán-tradition developed from the established tradition of "Canonical Buddhism",{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=177}}{{clarify|reason=This sfn reference missing long-form citation|date=August 2014}} which "remained normative for all later Chinese Buddhism".{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=177}}{{clarify|reason=This sfn reference missing long-form citation|date=August 2014}} It was established by the end of the sixth century, as a result of the Chinese developing understanding of Buddhism in the previous centuries.{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=177-184}}{{clarify|reason=This sfn reference missing long-form citation|date=August 2014}}{{sfn|Lai}}{{clarify|reason=This sfn reference missing long-form citation; missing year;|date=August 2014}}

One of the inventions of this Canonical Buddhism were transmission lists, a literary device to establish a lineage. Both [[Tiantai|T'ien Tai]] and Chán took over this literary device, to lend authority to those developing traditions, and guarantee its authenticity:{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=181}}{{clarify|reason=This sfn reference missing long-form citation|date=August 2014}}{{sfn|McRae|p=2-9}}{{clarify|reason=This sfn reference missing year|date=August 2014}}
{{quote|Chan texts present the school as Buddhism itself, or as ''the'' central teaching of Buddhism, which has been transmitted from the seven Buddhas of the past to the twenty-eight patriarchs, and all the generations of Chinese and Japanese Chan and Zen masters that follow.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=4}}}}

The concept of dharma transmission took shape during the Tang period, when establishing the right teachings became important, to safeguard the authority of specific schools.{{sfn|Ford|2006|pp=22-25}} The emerging Zen-tradition developed the ''Transmission of the Lamp''-genre, in which lineages from Shakyamuni Buddha up to their own times were described.{{sfn|McRae|2003}}

Another literary device for establishing those traditions was given by the ''Kao-seng-chuan'' (Biographies of Eminent Monks), compiled around 530.{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=181}}{{clarify|reason=This sfn reference missing long-form citation|date=August 2014}} The Chán-tradition developed its own corpus in this genre, with works such as ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'' (952) and the ''[[Transmission of the Lamp|Jingde Records of the Transmission of the Lamp]]'' (published 1004). McRae considers Dumoulin's ''A History of Zen'' to be a modern example of this genre, disguised as scientific history.{{sfn|McRae|2005}}{{clarify|reason=This sfn reference missing long-form citation|date=August 2014}}

===Chinese Patriarchs===
The Chán-lineages picture the Indian monk Bodhidharma as the patriarch who brought Chán to China. Only scarce historical information is available about him, but his hagiography developed when the Chan tradition grew stronger and gained prominence in the early 8th century.

====Six Chinese Patriarchs====
By this time a lineage of the six ancestral founders of Chán in China was developed.{{sfn|McRae|2003}} In the late 8th century, under the influence of Huineng's student [[Shenhui]], the traditional form of this lineage had been established:{{sfn|McRae|2003}}
# [[Bodhidharma]] ({{lang|zh|達摩}}) ca. 440 – ca. 528
# [[Huike]] ({{lang|zh|慧可}}) 487–593
# [[Sengcan]] ({{lang|zh|僧燦}}) ?–606
# [[Daoxin]] ({{lang|zh|道信}}) 580–651
# [[Daman Hongren|Hongren]] ({{lang|zh|弘忍}}) 601–674
# [[Huineng]] ({{lang|zh|慧能}}) 638–713

====Shenhui and Huineng====
[[File:Huineng-tearing-sutras.svg|thumb|left|100px|Huineng tearing sutras]]
According to tradition, the sixth and last ancestral founder, [[Huineng]] (惠能; 638–713), was one of the giants of Chán history, and all surviving schools regard him as their ancestor. The dramatic story of Huineng's life tells that there was a controversy over his claim to the title of patriarch. After being chosen by [[Daman Hongren|Hongren]], the fifth ancestral founder, Huineng had to flee by night to [[Nanhua Temple]] in the south to avoid the wrath of Hongren's jealous senior disciples.

Modern scholarship, however, has questioned this [[Zen#Zen narratives|narrative]]. Historic research reveals that this story was created around the middle of the 8th century, beginning in 731 by [[Shenhui]], a successor to Huineng, to win influence at the Imperial Court. He claimed Huineng to be the successor of Hongren's, instead of the then publicly recognized successor Shenxiu.{{sfn|McRae|2003}} In 745 Shen-hui was invited to take up residence in the Ho-tse temple in Lo-yang. In 753 he fell out of grace, and had to leave the capital to go into exile. The most prominent of the successors of his lineage was [[Guifeng Zongmi]]{{sfn|Yampolski|2003|p=9}} According to Tsung-mi, Shen-hui's approach was officially sanctioned in 796, when "an imperial commission determined that the Southern line of Ch'an represented the orthodox transmission and established Shen-hui as the seventh patriarch, placing an inscription to that effect in the shen-lung temple".{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=279}}

Doctrinally the Southern School is associated with the teaching that [[Subitism|enlightenment is sudden]], while the [[Northern School]] is associated with the teaching that enlightenment is gradual. This was a polemical exaggeration, since both schools were derived from the same tradition, and the so-called Southern School incorporated many teachings of the more influential Northern School.{{sfn|McRae|2003}} Eventually both schools died out, but the influence of Shenhui was so immense that all later Chan schools traced their origin to Huineng, and "sudden enlightenment" became a standard doctrine of Chan.{{sfn|McRae|2003}}

===Indian Patriarchs===
In later writings this lineage was extended to include twenty-eight Indian patriarchs. In the ''[[Song of Enlightenment]]'' (證道歌 ''Zhèngdào gē'') of [[Yongjia Xuanjue]] (永嘉玄覺, 665–713), one of the chief disciples of [[Huineng|Huìnéng]], it is written that Bodhidharma was the 28th patriarch in a line of descent from Mahākāśyapa, a disciple of [[Gautama Buddha|Śākyamuni Buddha]], and the first patriarch of Chán Buddhism. {{sfn|Chang|1967}}

====Twenty-eight Indian Patriarchs====
[[Keizan|Keizan's]] ''Transmission of the Light'' gives twenty-eight patriarchs up to and including Bodhidharma in this transmission:{{sfn|Keizan|2003}}{{sfn|Diener|1991|p=266}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|For narratives in English of most patriarchs see Houn Jiyu (Peggy Teresa Nancy Kennett), 1999, ''Zen is Eternal Life'' (''Selling Water by the River''), Mount Shasta, California: Shasta Abbey Press.}}

{{Zen Lineage 28 Patriarchs}}

====Mahākāśyapa====
According to the traditional Chán accounts, the first Dharma transmission occurred as described in the [[Flower Sermon]]. The Buddha held up a golden [[lotus (plant)|lotus]] flower before an assembly of "gods and men". None who were in attendance showed any sign of understanding except his disciple [[Mahākāśyapa]], who offered only a smile. The Buddha then said, 
{{quote|I have the right Dharma Eye Treasury, the wondrous mind of nirvana, the reality beyond appearance. The Dharma-door of mind to mind transmission has been entrusted to Kāśyapa.&lt;ref name="epstein"&gt;Epstein, 130&lt;/ref&gt; Epstein comments, "Thus Mahākāśyapa received the transmission of Dharma and became the first Buddhist patriarch."&lt;ref name="epstein"/&gt;}}

==Function of Dharma Transmission==
Though dharma transmission implies the acknowledgement of insight into the teachings of Buddhism as understood by the Zen tradition, especially [[kensho|seeing into one's true nature]], dharma transmission is also a means to establish a person into the Zen tradition:{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=23}}
{{quote|The procedure establishes the disciple as a transmitting teacher in their own right and successor in an unbroken [[Lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of teachers and disciples, a spiritual 'bloodline' (''[[kechimyaku]]'') theoretically traced back to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] himself."&lt;ref name="Haskel, 2"/&gt;}}

The dharma lineage reflects the importance of family-structures in ancient China, and forms a symbolic and ritual recreation of this system for the monastical "family".{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=264}}

===Esoteric and exoteric transmission===
According to Borup the emphasis on 'mind to mind transmission' is a form of esoteric transmission, in which "the tradition and the enlightened mind is transmitted face to face".{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=9}} Metaphorically this can be described as the transmission of a flame from one candle to another candle,{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=9}} or the transmission from one vein to another.{{sfn|Faure|2000|p=58}} In exoteric transmission the requirement is  "direct access to the teaching through a personal discovery of one's self. This type of transmission and identification is symbolized by the discovery of a shining lantern, or a mirror."{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=9}}

This polarity is recognizable in the emphasis that the Zen-tradition puts on maintaining the correct Dharma transmission, while simultaneously stressing seeing into one's nature:
{{quote|The matter of learning from a teacher is most essential. People of old who arrived at the source of [[Kensho|seeing nature]], passed through many barriers clearly and completely without a dot of doubt, and traveled freely through the world opening big mouths in discussion, only came to know the transcendental message of Zen after they finally ran into Zen masters of great vision. Then they sincerely sought certainty and wound up with the duty of the teacher's succession, bearing the debt of Dharma, never to forget it for a moment. This is called dharma succession. Since ancient times the designated succession of the ancestral teachers has always been like this.{{sfn|Torei|2010|p=88}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The modern framing of Zen as the ''experience'' of 'ultimate truth' or reality{{sfn|Sharf|2005}} may influence the institutional shape western Zen is going to take, where individual freedom is highly appraised. See also Bodiford 2008, pp 277-279}}}}

Nevertheless, while the Zen tradition has always stressed the importance of formal Dharma transmission, there are well known examples of [[Mushi dokugo]], such as [[Nōnin]], [[Jinul]] and [[Suzuki Shōsan]] who attained awakening on their own, though all of them were familiair with the Zen-teachings.

===Family structure===
According to Bodiford, "Zen is the predominant form of Buddhism because of dharma transmission":{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=264}}
{{quote|[I]t has ancestors whom it honors. It honors those ancestors by transmitting their legacy to proper descendants, from generation to generation, who will maintain and carry on their family traditions [...] [I]n Zen this process of transmitting a family legacy is given structural form through the ritual of dharma transmission.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=264}}}}

Bodiford distinguishes seven dimensions which are discernible in both family relationships and in dharma lineages:
# Ancestral dimension: "Ancestors (''so'') constitute a fundamental source of power".{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=264}} Performing rituals in honour of the ancestors keeps them in high regard "among the living".{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=264}}
# Biological dimension: the dharma lineage creates (spiritual) offspring, just as the family creates new life.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|pp=264-265}}
# Linguistic dimension: dharma heirs receive new names, which reflect their tie to the dharma 'family'.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=265}}
# Ritual dimension: rituals confirm the family relationships. One's teacher is honored in rituals, as are deceased teachers.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|pp=265-266}}
# Legal dimension: teachers have the obligation to discipline their students, just as students have the obligation to obey their teachers.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=266}}
# Institutional and financial dimension: dharma heirs have an obligation to support their home temple, both financially and ritually.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|pp=266-267}}
# Temporal dimension: long-term relationships foster the previous dimensions.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=267}}

The family-model is easier recognized when East Asian languages are being used, because the same terminology is used to describe both earthly and spiritual family relations.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|pp=267-268}}

Dharma transmission is both concrete and abstract:{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=268}}
{{quote|Every link in the genealogy of dharma transmission occurs in documented historical circumstances: a specific place and time, identifiable individuals, and specific words and actions. At the same time, though, Zen texts also assert that true transmission consists of no transmission. In other words, it occurs only mind-to-mind.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=268}}}}

This feature gives dharma transmission a great flexibility:{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=268}}
{{quote|[W]hen the historical evidence is in one's favor, one can demonstrate the validity of dharma transmission by citing any number of the aforementioned seven dimensions. When the historical evidence is less favorable, then one can shift the argument to the religious realm by arguing that the only facts that really matter are the depths and quality of one's Buddha realization.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=268}}}}

==Contemporary use in the Zen-traditions==
Within the various Zen traditions dharma transmission got various meanings. A difference is made in most schools between 
{{quote|...acknowledgement of awakening itself [which] remained separate from monastic leadership.{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=54}}}}

===Chinese Chán===
Traditional Chinese Chán still exists in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, though it is less known in the west than Japanese Zen.

In the Chinese Buddhist tradition, there are 3 systems of transmission:&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.182828165075325.43405.100000444276511&amp;type=3 Ven Huei Guang Facebook photo album with dharma transmission explanation]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Tonsure system: a person becomes tonsured as a novice monastic under the Master's school. He/she is given a Dharma name 法號 at the time of tonsure based on the Master's lineage. This name is also called "the outer name 外號" because it is used by all people to address you. This name is used for life. At the same time, the Master will give the novice sramanera (or sramanerika) ten precepts.
# Ordination system: a novice will become fully ordained as a Bhikṣu monk/ Bhikṣuni nun with the Triple Platform Ordination (Observing the Śrāmanera, Bhikṣu and Bodhisattva precepts). This ordination must be presided by 10 monks with at least 10 years of seniority with a pure practice in upholding the monastic precepts. In this ceremony, the 10 Masters represent the Triple Gem accepting the novice into the Sangha. At this time, another Dharma name 法名 is given. This name is also called "precept name 戒名 or inner name 內號" because it is used only by one's Master. This name represents your precept lineage transmission.
# Dharma transmission system:{{sfn|Sharf|2005}}{{sfn|Adamek|2006}} This system upholds the Treasury of the True Dharma Eye through the generations of transmission. This is the Mind to Mind seal of the Dharma that is beyond the scriptures. At this time, another Dharma name 法名 is given. This is also called "the inner name 內號" and use only by one's Master. This name represents your Dharma lineage transmission. After receiving this name, one will use this name instead of the name received during precept ordination to write one's Dharma name (Inner Name)(Outer Name).

It is customary to refer to one's own tonsure Master as "Gracious Master", precept Master as "Root Master" and Dharma transmission Master as "Venerable Master". In [[Chinese Buddhism]], these 3 systems are separate and are not performed by the same Masters. Moreover, due to the strong emphasis on the Dharma, when a person receives the Dharma transmission, he/she is recognized as that Ch'an Master's Dharma son/daughter. Of course lay Buddhists may also receive this Dharma transmission, but there are very few incidences. Most of the monk/nun who received the transmission has already been tonsured and ordained by other Masters.

===Rinzai===
{{main article|Rinzai school}}

All Rinzai lineages pass through [[Hakuin Ekaku]], the 18th century revivalist, who considered himself to be an heir of Shoju Rojin (Shoju Ronin, Dokyu Etan, 1642–1721), though Hakuin never received formal dharma transmission from Shoju Rojin,{{sfn|Mohr|2003|p=311-312}} nor from any other teacher.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/monkeymind/2009/02/teaching-credentials-in-zen.html James Ford (2009), ''Teaching Credentials in Zen'']&lt;/ref&gt; When he was installed as head priest of Shōin-ji in 1718, he had the title of ''Dai-ichiza'', "First Monk":{{sfn|Waddell|2010|p=xxix}}
{{quote|It was the minimum rank required by government regulation for those installed as temple priests and seems to have been little more than a matter of paying a fee and registering Hakuin as the incumbent of Shōin-ji.{{sfn|Waddell|2010|p=xxix}}}}

All contemporary Rinzai-lineages stem from Inzan Ien (1751–1814) and Takuju Kosen (1760–1833),{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005|p=392}}{{sfn|Stevens|1999|p=90}} both students of Gasan Jito (1727–1797). Gasan is considered to be a dharma heir of Hakuin, though "he did not belong to the close circle of disciples and was probably not even one of Hakuin's dharma heirs".{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005|p=391}}

Through Hakuin, all contemporary Japanese Rinzai-lineages are part of the [[Ōtōkan]] lineage, brought to Japan in 1267 by [[Nanpo Jomyo]], who received dharma transmission in China in 1265.&lt;ref group=web name=ROZ&gt;[http://zen.rinnou.net/whats_zen/history.html#The%20Transmission%20of%20Zen%20to%20Japan Rinzai-Obaku Zen - What is Zen? - History]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Insight and succession====
In the [[Rinzai school]], a difference is made between acknowledgement of insight and succession in the organisation:
{{quote|From the Rinzai perspective, true realization (jisshō) and succession to a master (shijō) are two different stages in the course of practice, the latter implying a comprehensive integration of awakening in the activities of everyday life.{{sfn|Mohr|1994|p=359}}}}

According to Mohr, 
{{quote|In the Rinzai school the issue of Dharma transmission is essentially subjective, that is, left to the discretion of the master, and the ambiguity of terms such as "successor in the Dharma" (hassu 法嗣) has persisted down to the present. According to the context or the circumstances, it can signify either spiritual recognition or inheritance of a temple lineage.{{sfn|Mohr|1994|p=358}}}}

The most common form of transmission in Rinzai Zen is the acknowledgement that one has stayed in the monastery for a certain amount of time, and may later become a temple priest.{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=13}}

====Further practice====
After finishing the koan-study, further practice is necessary:
{{quote|[I]t would take 10 years to solve all the kôans [...] in the sôdô. After the student has solved all koans, he can leave the sôdô and live on his own, but he is still not considered a roshi. For this he has to complete another ten years of training, called "go-go-no-shugyô" in Japanese. Literally, this means "practice after satori/enlightenment", but [[Keido Fukushima|Fukushima]] preferred the translation "special practice". Fukushima would explain that the student builds up a "religious personality" during this decade. I would say it is a kind of period that functions to test if the student is actually able to live in regular society and apply his koan understanding to daily life, after he has lived in an environment that can be quite surreal and detached from the lives of the rest of humanity. Usually, the student lives in a small parish temple during this decade, not in a formal training monastery.&lt;ref name=Antaiji10 group=web&gt;[http://antaiji.dogen-zen.de/eng/201201.shtml Muho Noelke, ''Part 10: What does it take to become a full-fledged Sōtō-shu priest and is it really worth the whole deal?'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Inka shōmei====
The common transmission does not include ''inka shōmei''. Ideally ''inka shōmei'' is "the formal recognition of Zen's deepest realisation",{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=54}} but practically it is being used for the transmission of the "true lineage" of the masters (''shike'') of the training halls.{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=13}} Training halls are temples which are authorised for further training after being qualified as a temple priest.

There are only about fifty&lt;ref name=Antaiji10 group=web /&gt; to eighty&lt;ref group=web name="Buddhadharma" /&gt; of such ''inka shōmei''-bearers in Japan:
{{quote|In Rinzai Zen, it is relatively easy to say who is a roshi and who is not. Anyone who is authorized by another roshi (i.e. his teacher) is a roshi. This authorization (officially the "inka-shômei" document) is documented on a piece of paper, that is why it is also called colloquially "ichi-mai", that is "one sheet (of paper)". The transmission is totally vertical from teacher to student, no peer control is involved. That means that the Rinzai sect has no means to control who is made a roshi and who is not. In spite of that, the number of Rinzai roshis is relatively low, maybe around 50 or so.&lt;ref name=Antaiji10 group=web /&gt;}}

According to roshi Sokun Tsushimoto, the title of ''roshi'' is equivalent to ''Zen master'' and ''shike'':&lt;ref name="BD" /&gt;
{{quote|'Roshi' is the title compatible with the most formal title ‘Shike’ who got officially authorized as a Dharma successor by authentic master.&lt;ref name="BD"&gt;[http://boeddhistischdagblad.nl/rients-ritskes-op-beschuldiging-raksu-formeel-uitgereikt-als-bewijs-van-een-competent-zenleader/ Boeddhistisch Dagblad, 17 april 2013, ''Rients Ritskes op beschuldiging: ‘Raksu formeel uitgereikt als bewijs van competent zenleiderschap’''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420011852/http://boeddhistischdagblad.nl/rients-ritskes-op-beschuldiging-raksu-formeel-uitgereikt-als-bewijs-van-een-competent-zenleader/ |date=April 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more information on Sokun Tsushimoto, see [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20090802x1.html The Japan Times online: Caring for body and soul. Interview with Sokun Tsushimoto]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A qualified [[Zen master]] bestows inka only upon "those select few"{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}} who have successfully completed the entire Rinzai koan curriculum,{{sfn|Seager|1999|p=107}}&lt;ref&gt;Matthiessen, 277&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}} and "are eligible to serve as ''sōdō'' roshi,{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}} that is, master of a training hall, in distinction from a common temple:
{{quote|[D]isciples today are expected to spend a dozen or more years with a master to complete a full course of training in koan commentary. Only when a master is satisfied that a disciple can comment appropriately on a wide range of old cases will he recognize the latter as a dharma heir and give him formal "proof of transmission" (J. ''[[inka shomei]]''). Thus, in reality, a lot more than ''satori'' is required for one to be recognized as a master (J. ''shike'', ''roshi'') in the Rinzai school of Zen at present. The accepted proof of ''satori'' is a set of literary and rhetorical skills that takes many years to acquire.{{sfn|Griffith Foulk|2000|p=42}}}}

According to roshi Sokun Tsushimoto,
{{quote|Authorization as a Roshi should be done in the most formal and explicit way. In Rinzai tradition a master gives a calligraphy of Inka-certificate to disciple as a proof of authorization. Needless to say authorization must be backed up by the fact that the disciple spent many years in zen training under the master earnestly and continuously.&lt;ref name="BD" /&gt;}}

{{Nihongo|'''Inka Shōmei'''|印可証明|}} (''[[Korean language|Korean]]:'' '''Inga''') literally means "the legitimate seal of clearly furnished proof":{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=54}} 
{{quote|The ideogram for ''inka'' has two parts: ''in'' is on one side, ''ka'' is on the other. The root meaning resides in the character for ''in'' (''yin'' in Chinese). The right half of this ''in'' consists of an ancient character shaped like our modern ''P''. In ancient times the character represented an actual object. It stood for the image of just the right half ('''P''') of the emperor's official seal ('''IP'''), ''after'' the Emperor had broken in half the whole seal."&lt;ref name="austin"&gt;Austin, 266-267&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The right-hand portion of the seal was given to an individual who would then work by authority of the emperor, while the emperor himself would retain the left-hand portion. In ancient times inka usually came in the form of an actual document, but this practice is no longer commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;Hori, 674&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sōtō===
In Sōtō, dharma transmission is the acknowledgement of the ties between teacher and student. It has been subject to changes over the history of the Sōtō-school.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991}}

Though [[Dōgen]] emphasized the importance of the purity of the teachings, and highly valued lineage and dharma transmission, the Sōtō-school has its origins in various lineages and dharma transmissions.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|pp=270-271}} Dogen received dharma transmission from his Chinese teacher [[Rujing]], with whom he studied two years, but in medieval Sōtō he was also considered to be a dharma heir of Myōzen, a Rinzai-teacher, with whom he studied eight years.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=426}} And [[Tettsū Gikai]], the dharma-grandson of Dogen, was also lineage-holder of [[Nōnin]], the founder of the Dharuma-shu, also a Rinzai-school.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|pp=426-427}} Gikai passed this linegae over to [[Keizan]], who thereby was also lineage-holder in at least two lineages.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=427}}

To make the history of Sōtō even more complicated, the [[Caodong]]-lineage that Dogen inherited through Rujing was passed on previously from the Caodong-master [[Dayang Jingxuan]] to [[Touzi Yiqing]] via the Rinzai-master Fushan Fayuan. Fushan Fayuan had once studied under Dayang Jingxuan. When Jingxuan died Fayuan had received Jingxuan's "portrait, robe, and a verse that expressed his teaching",{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=428}} promising "to pass them on to a suitable successor". Fayuan chose his student Touzi Yiqing to inherit this lineage,{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=428}} a fact that was acknowledged in Keizan's Denkoroku, but "[i]n the standard versions of Dogen's writings, however, all direct references to Yiqing's indirect succession have been eliminated".{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=428}}

====Criteria====
Manzan Dokahu (1636–1714), a Sōtō reformer,
{{quote|[P]ropagated the view that Dharma transmission was dependent on personal initiation between a Master and disciple rather than on the disciple's enlightenment. He maintained this view in the face of strong opposition, citing as authority the towering figure of Japanese Zen, Dogen [...] This became and continues to this day to be the official Sōtō Zen view. {{sfn|Lachs|1999}}}}

According to Manzan, even an unenlightened student could receive dharma transmission:
{{quote|Manzan argued that as long as master and disciple fulfill the condition of a personal relationship, then Dharma transmission 'with either an enlightened or an unenlightened disciple are both equivalent in [maintaining] the true tradition'.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=444}}}}

In Sōtō-zen, since Manzan Dokahu, two criteria are applied for dharma transmission:
# ''Isshi inshō'' – "Exclusive authentication from no more than one teacher".{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=270}} This criterion "prohibits clerics inheriting more than one lineage"{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=270}}
# ''Menju shihō'' – "Face-to-face bestowal of succession".{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=270}} This criterion "prohibits conferral by proxy, conferral at a distance to strangers, or posthumous conferral".{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=270}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The origins of Sōtō-zen, or Dogen-shu, are in contradiction to this criterium. Gikai, the third abbot of Ehei-ji, was also lineage-holder of [[Nōnin]]. According to the ''Denkoroku'', Dogen himself had also received dharma transmission from Myōzen.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005}}{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|pp=270-271}}{{sfn|Faure|2000}}}}

====Status====
In contrast to the status that dharma transmission has begotten in the west, in Sōtō it has a relatively low status:
{{quote|[D]harma transmission provides access to only a relatively low grade. It is listed as a requirement for the very lowest ecclesiastical status, that of an instructor third class (''[[Zen ranks and hierarchy|santō kyōshi]]''). Thus, in present day Sōtō Zen, dharma transmission constitutes a preliminary step, after which one's real development begins [...] Today, the key authority conferred by dharma transmission is that it qualifies a priest to manage an ordinary (''jun hōchi'') local temple. These temples are not ascetic training but of ceremonial services on behalf of lay patrons.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=276}}}}

To supervise the training of monks, further qualifications are necessary:
{{quote|The relatively low status of dharma transmission means that in and of itself it does not qualify one to accept students or to train disciples. According to the regulations, Zen students should be supervised only by a teacher who has attained supervisory certification (i.e. ''sanzen dōjō shike'' status), that is, someone who in the popular literature might be called a [[Zen master]]. To attain supervisory certification requires not just high ecclesiastical grades and dharma seniority but also at least three years' experience as an assistant supervisor at a specially designated training hall (''tokubetsu sōdō''), during which time one undergoes an apprenticeship.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=276}}}}

The duties which come with this full qualification were not always appreciated. In the medieval organisation of the Sōtō-shu, when rotation of abbotship was the norm. Dharma transmission at a branch temple obliged one to serve at least one term as abbot at the main temple. Abbotship gave severe duties, and financial burdens, for which reason many tried to avoid the responsibility of abbotship:{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=273}}
{{quote|Tsūgen, Baisan and Jochū each demanded that future generations excommunicate any Zen teacher who failed to fulfill his obligation to serve as abbot of a head temple. Baisan decreed that the obedient Zen successors should seize defiant ones and then burn the offender's succession's certificate (''shisho'') before his eyes. Note the remarkable inversion that has occurred here. Instead of dharma transmission being a qualification for becoming an abbot, successful service as abbot has become a requirement for being allowed to retain one's dharma transmission.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=273}}}}

====Spiritual realization====
The Sōtō-shu also confers inka shōmyō (or ''inshō'') "[granting] the seal of approval to a realization of enlightenment",{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=423}} upon students. This is an 
{{quote|... idealized religious aspect of the Dharma transmission process. Zen master and disciple may evoke this mystical paradigm through ritual ceremony in the master's room (''shi-tsunai''), but other, more mundane institutional concerns can govern the actual selection and promotion of Dharma 'heirs'.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=423}}}}

Dharma transmission is part of the maintenance of the Sōtō-institutions. Authority and temple-property are handed down, often from father to son.{{sfn|Tetsuo|2003}} It is not a guarantee for spiritual attainment:
{{quote|dharma transmission is no guarantee for anything. It only shows that the person who gave the transmission – and only that one person – was convinced that the student was qualified as a teacher. Could he have been wrong? Yes, he could have been wrong. Therefore, if you want to make sure that a teacher is actually a good teacher, you should not only ask if he or she has dharma transmission or not. The question is: Where does this dharma transmission come from? What lineage does it represent? And even more important: What practice did accompany it? What kind of student was the teacher before he or she became a teacher? What is his or her practice now?&lt;ref name =Antaiji2 group=web&gt;[http://antaiji.dogen-zen.de/eng/201005.shtml Muho Noelke, ''Part 2: Ten points to keep in mind about dharma transmission'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Shiho====
[Please note that this section provides only one reference from a single individual. Help Wikipedia by including more sources.]

Dharma transmission is also called ''shiho''.{{sfn|Seager|1999|p=107}} In the [[Sōtō]] school a student receives Dharma transmission during a ''denbō'' ceremony, which is the last ceremony of their [[shiho]] ceremony: 
{{quote|The usual practice...is for a Sōtō monk to be given Dharma transmission by the priest who ordained him (in most cases his own father), after he returns from his minimum period of monastery training. Because Dharma transmission is a prerequisite to becoming the head priest of a Sōtō branch temple, virtually all Sōtō priests meet this ritual requirement at a relatively early stage in their careers."&lt;ref name="kraft"&gt;Kraft, 20; 173&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Shiho is...
{{quote|...the recognition of the transmission that took place long before the ceremony itself. In fact, it has nothing to do at all with the paper, with philosophy or with mystical experience. The 24 hours of the daily life shared by teacher and student are the content of the transmission, and nothing else [...] In Antaiji, when you receive shiho after, say, eight or nine years, you will have sat for 15.000 hours of zazen with your teacher. Not only that, you also shared many thousands of meals with him, worked together in the fields for thousands of hours, spread manure, cut grass and wood together, side by side, you sweat together in the summer and froze together in the winter. You cooked for him and filled the bath tub for him, you know how he likes the temperature both of his soup and the bathing water. You also shared many drinks, probably. In each of these activities, the dharma is transmitted. None should be left out.&lt;ref name=Antaiji2 group=web/&gt;}}

Shiho is done "one-to-one in the abbot's quarters (hojo)".&lt;ref name=Antaiji2 group=web /&gt; Three handwritten documents certify the dharma transmission;
{{quote|a) Shisho (the scripture of transmission, the names of the ancestors arranged in a circle – the dharma has passed on from to Shakyamuni to yourself, and now you give it back to Shakyamuni. There is a small piece of papaer, probably originally written by Sawaki Roshi, with some comments. This paper is also copied by the student when doing dharma transmission at Antaiji.)
b) Daiji (the great matter, a cryptic symbolization of the content of the teaching. Again, there is a small extra sheet of paper that explains about the meaning of the symbols.)
c) Kechimyaku (the blood lineage, looks quite similar to the blood line transmission that you already wrote at the time of ordination) 
d) Actually, in the lineage of Sawaki Roshi (and maybe other lineages as well) a student is told to write a fourth document on an extra sheet of paper, which is called Hisho (the secret document, which is encoded, but the code for decyphering is on the same paper, so once you hold it in your hands it is not so "secret" anymore.)&lt;ref name=Antaiji2 group=web /&gt;}}

The procedure has to take place only once in one's life, and binds the student to the teacher forever:
{{quote|Dharma transmission can happen once, and only once, or never at all. Multiple dharma transmission is nonsense. If you receive dharma transmission from one teacher, from then on that is your one and only teacher, your real teacher (jap. hon-shi). The multiple lineage holders that you hear of in the West are bullshit. Therefore it is important that both sides, but especially the student, make sure that this is the right time for them to make this important step.&lt;ref name =Antaiji2 group=web /&gt;}}

If a students does not have the feeling he wants to be tied to this teacher for the rest of his life, he may refuse to take dharma transmission from this particular teacher.&lt;ref name=Antaiji2 group=web /&gt; Since the time of Manzan Dokahu (1636–1714), multiple dharma transmissions are impossible in Sōtō Zen.&lt;ref name=Antaiji2 group=web /&gt;{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005}}

====Further study====
According to [[Muho Noelke]], dharma transmission marks the beginning of the real learning:
{{quote|Dharma transmission is not the last and final step in a student's practice. Quite the opposite, one might call it the real first step on the way of practice. The way has just begun, but now the student has decided which exact way he wants to follow to the end. But all the real hardships still lay ahead of him. To use the example of boy-meets-girl again: At this point of time they have decided that they are made for each other, so to speak, they want to get married and have kids. Hopefully, that does not mean that the romance is over. It just means that both are prepared for the real struggle to begin.&lt;ref name =Antaiji2 group=web /&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|This is reflected by the [[Five Ranks|Five ranks of enlightenment]]. The same notion can be found within the Rinzai-tradition. See [[Linji Yixuan#Expressing the inexpressible|Three mysterious Gates]], and the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Four Ways of Knowing]]}}}}

After Dharma transmission one has become a member of the "blood line" of Zen, but is not yet qualified as an [[Oshō]]. After the [[Zen ranks and hierarchy|ten-e]] and [[Zen ranks and hierarchy|zuise]] ceremonies, one is qualified as an oshō. There-after one has to practice for some time, at least six months, in an ''sôdô-ango'', an officially recognized Sōtō-shu training centre.&lt;ref name=Antaiji5 group=web&gt;[http://antaiji.dogen-zen.de/eng/adult50.shtml Muho Noelke, ''Part 5: Sessa-takuma - ango as life in a rock grinder'']&lt;/ref&gt;

After that one can start to work in a temple. The newly acquired status is confirmed in the ''kyoshi-honin'' ceremony. There-after follows the first practice-period in one's own temple, with the aid of a ''susho'' (head monk). This is followed by the ''Jushoku-himei'' ceremony, which confirms one's status as ''dai-oshō''.&lt;ref name=Antaiji5 group=web /&gt;

===Sanbo Kyodan===
The [[Sanbo Kyodan]] mixes Sōtō and Rinzai-elements.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a}} Students in this school follow the [[Kōan#Sanbo Kyodan|Harada-Yasutani koan curriculum]], in which great emphasis is placed on [[kensho]], the initial insight into one's true nature.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=430-431}} Having attained kensho is publicly acknowledged in a ''jahai''-ceremony.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=430}} After working through the Harada-Yasutani koan curriculum, which may take as short as five years,{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=432}} the student receives a calligraphy testifying that het or she "has finished the great matter".{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=432}} This is publicly acknowledged in the ''hasansai''-ceremony, giving the status of ''hasan''.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=432}}

The Sanbo Kyodan has two levels of teaching authority, namely ''junshike'' ("associate zen master"), and ''shōshike'' ("authentic zen master").{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=432}} Junshikes can give dokusan, authorize kensho, and supervise part of the koan-study. Shoshikes can supervise the advanced koan-study, and perform religious ceremonies, such as the precept-ceremony and wedding ceremonies.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}}

The process toward gaining these titles has seen some variations within the Sanbo Kyodan. ''Hasansai'' may be preparatory to the ''junshike''-title, but may also be the promotion to this title. And promotion to ''shoshike'' may be preparatory to dharma transmission, but may also be equivalent to it.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}}

In dharma transmission, the student receives the ''sanmotsu'', akin to the Sōtō shiho ceremony.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}} This is coupled with the Rinzai notion on ''inka''.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}} In Rinzai, only students who have completed the complete Rinzai koan curriculum and "are eligible to serve as ''sōdō'' roshi,{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}} that is, master of a training hall, in distinction from a common temple, receive inka. In the Sanbo Kyodan, ''inka'' is derived from Harada's Rinzai master Dokutan Sōsan.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}}

===White Plum Asanga===
[[File:Shiho ceremony.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Michel Genko Dubois (left) and [[Dennis Genpo Merzel]] performing "mind to mind" in Dubois's [[shiho]] ceremony.]]

In the [[White Plum Asanga]], Dharma transmission comes first, and qualifies one as a [[sensei]].{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=102}} This may be followed by inka, the final acknowledgemment:{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=102}}{{sfn|Seager|1999}}&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, 25-26&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|… once you have transmission then your teacher is sort of watching to see how you’re doing as a teacher – on how you are conducting yourself and, after a period of time, if the teacher has confidence in your understanding and ability to teach (that you are conducting yourself with integrity and clarity) then, at some point, the person will get the final seal of approval – which is what inka is. There is nothing particularly mysterious about it.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://sweepingzen.com/inka SweepingZen, ''Inka shomi'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Korean Soen===
In Korean Soen, Inka (In'ga) typically refers to the private acknowledgement of dharma transmission from a teacher to their student. "Transmission" is used to refer to the public ceremonial version of the same acknowledgement.

Both are considered equal in authority and "realization". A monk with either In'ga or the public "transmission" is qualified to hold the post of Soen Sa, or "Zen Master" for a temple, and give transmission to their own students (either, In'ga or public "transmission"). The majority of Zen Masters in Korea have only received, and only give In'ga, with the formal transmission ceremony being far more rare.&lt;ref&gt;Buswell&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Western [[Kwan Um School of Zen]] created by the Korean Zen Master [[Seung Sahn]], "Inka" is granted to an individual who has completed their koan training and is granted the title [[Ji Do Poep Sa Nim]]. Dharma transmission in the Kwan Um School of Zen comes after inka, denoting the individual is now a [[Soen Sa Nim]].&lt;ref name="ford"&gt;Ford, 93; 220&lt;/ref&gt; Seung Sahn himself is quoted saying in reference to the administration of his Western organization, 
{{quote|Inka and transmission are different. Our 'Ji Do Poep Sa Nim' title is like the Japanese title 'sensei.' In Korea, we call it 'Chong Yong Sun'—your practice is okay, teaching other people is possible. This title has almost disappeared in Korea, although it still exists in China. In Korea we now have the title 'Ip Sung Sunim.'—'head monk.'" This innovation applies only to Seung Sahn's Western organization, and is not normative for Korean Soen/Zen practice either historically, or currently.&lt;ref&gt;Seung Sahn&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Vietnamese Thien===
[[Thich Nhat Hanh]] has created a ritual known as "Lamp Transmission", making a teacher a Dharmacharya—an individual with "limited teaching authority."&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt; According to author [[James Ishmael Ford]], 
{{quote|Regarding the issue of Dharma transmission, Thich Nhat Hanh has said no single student will succeed him. Instead his community of practice will itself be his successor. He is quoted as saying [[Maitreya]], the Buddha of future birth, may be a community of practice rather than an individual. What this actually means will only become apparent over the next decades.&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt;}}

==Criticism==
In the western understanding, dharma transmission stands solely for recognition of authentic insight, whereas in the Japanese monastery system dharma transmission is a formal notification that someone is fully qualified to take a leading role in this system.{{sfn|Sharf|1995}}{{sfn|Lachs|2006}} In the USA and Europe dharma transmission is linked to the unofficial title [[Rōshi|roshi]], older teacher. In the Western understanding roshis are "part of a tradition that imputes to them quasi-divine qualities",{{sfn|Lachs|2006}} someone who "is defined by simplicity, innocence, and lack of self-interest or desire".{{sfn|Lachs|2006}} Nevertheless, the authorisation of teachers through dharma transmission does not mean that teachers are infallible,{{sfn|Ford}} as is clear from the repeated appearance of scandals:{{sfn|Lachs|2006}}
{{quote|In this complicated world of living Zen, we can meet teachers guiding communities of practice with compassion and grace. But we also find Zen teachers having inappropriate sexual relationships, abusing the power dynamics of their relationships and otherwise acting in ways contrary to the mythic status of their positions as teachers. In recent years there have been a number of books and essays exposing the ills of Zen institutions east and west as well as the foibles of individual Zen teachers. Here in the west there are few lineages that have passed unscathed by scandals, mostly of a sexual nature. And in the east, particularly in the Japanese institutions, we’ve learned how masters and whole schools were at various times co-opted by the state, most notoriously in the years leading up to and including the Second World War.{{sfn|Ford}}}}

According to Lachs,{{who|date=August 2017}} those scandals have also been possible because of the status given to roshis by dharma transmission, and "a desire for the master’s aura, recognition, and approval":{{sfn|Lachs|2006}}
{{quote|The students expect the real teacher to be an ideal teacher and look forward to having such an ideal teacher lead and instruct them. The student who enters the practice having read a myth will expect to find the myth and will think they have found the myth. Unfortunately, they have found the myth without recognizing it for what it is. What they really have found, all too often, is another story of ordinary, flawed human behavior.{{sfn|Lachs|2006}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14131">'''[[Distributed ledger]] technology law''' ("'''DLT law'''") (also called '''[[Blockchain]] law'''.&lt;ref&gt;James G. Gatto, 'United States: Nevada Passes Pro-blockchain Law' (Mondaq, 23 June 2017) &lt;http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/604562/fin+tech/Nevada+Passes+Problockchain+Law&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Lex Cryptographia'''&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Aaron Wright and Primavera De Filippi, 'Decentralized Blockchain Technology and the Rise of Lex Cryptographia' (2015) SSRN Electronic Journal &lt;http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2580664&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;) is not yet defined and recognized but an emerging field of law due to the recent dissemination of distributed ledger technology application in business and governance environment.

== Analogy with the [[Law of the Horse]] and [[Legal aspects of computing|Law of cyberspace]] debate ==

Ubiquitous dissemination of [[information technology]] and the [[Internet]] led to a discussion of two opposite legal theories of the regulation of [[cyberspace]]. According to The [[Law of the Horse]] theory proposed by [[Frank H. Easterbrook]], general principles of law governing property, transactions and torts apply to any relationship whether in case of the horse or cyberspace and there is no reason to invent new fields of law designated for each.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Easterbrook, 'Cyberspace and the law of the horse' (1996) U Chi Legal F 207 &lt;https://www.law.upenn.edu/fac/pwagner/law619/f2001/week15/easterbrook.pdf&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was challenged by [[Lawrence Lessig]], who argued that in case of cyberspace the code may be considered as another way of regulation and therefore the cyberspace may be treated more widely than just another area of relations regulated by conventional legal principles.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Lessig, 'The Law of the Horse: What Cyberlaw Might Teach' (1999) 113 Harv L Rev 501 &lt;https://cyber.harvard.edu/works/lessig/finalhls.pdf&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Employing more liberal approach the DLT law may mean the body of law "characterized by a set of rules administered through self-executing smart contracts and decentralized (and potentially autonomous) organizations".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Areas of law ==

As of the beginning of 2018 the DLT law does not constitute a separate field of law rather it encompasses aspects of corporate, contract, investment, banking and finance law. According to conservative approach the DLT law may be considered as a part of existent area of law, which may be applied to regulate different aspects of DLT use and new kind of legal relations on blockchain, such as issue of authorisation (electronic signature), admissibility of blockchain evidence in court, status of [[cryptocurrency]] and regulation of [[initial coin offering]], use of [[smart contract]]s, status of [[The DAO (organization)|DAO]] (decentralized autonomous organization) and other.

== Status of blockchain-based records and smart contracts ==

While in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/search|title=UK Find legislation|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Union|EU]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://europa.eu/european-union/law/find-legislation_en|title=EU Find legislation|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the beginning of 2018 the legislators are still silent about blockchain technology, in the [[United States]] several states already enacted legislation providing a framework for business and legal application of blockchain technology and enforceability of smart contracts.

=== [[Vermont]] ===
On 2 June 2016 Vermont became the first state, which recognised blockchain-based records having legal bearing in a court under the Vermont Rules of Evidence and defined blockchain technology as "mathematically secured, chronological, and decentralized consensus ledger or database, whether maintained via Internet interaction, peer-to-peer network, or otherwise"&lt;ref&gt;House Bill 868 &lt;https://legislature.vermont.gov/assets/Documents/2016/Docs/ACTS/ACT157/ACT157%20As%20Enacted.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Arizona]] ===
In March 2017, Arizona’s Electronic Transactions Act (the AETA) was amended by HB 2417 Act to clarify that “electronic records, electronic signatures, and smart contract terms secured through blockchain technology and governed under UCC Articles 2, 2A and 7 will be considered to be in an electronic form and to be an electronic signature under AETA.”&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Neuburger, 'Arizona Passes Groundbreaking Blockchain and Smart Contract Law – State Blockchain Laws on the Rise' (Proscauer, 20 April 20, 2017) &lt;https://newmedialaw.proskauer.com/2017/04/20/arizona-passes-groundbreaking-blockchain-and-smart-contract-law-state-blockchain-laws-on-the-rise/&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; HB 2417 Act also provides a definition of blockchain technology as a “distributed, decentralized, shared and replicated ledger, which may be public or private, permissioned or permissionless, or driven by tokenized crypto economics or tokenless”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and definition of smart contract as "event driven program, with state, that runs on a distributed, decentralized, shared and replicated ledger that can take custody over and instruct transfer of assets on that ledger".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;House Bill 2417 &lt;https://legiscan.com/AZ/text/HB2417/id/1588180/Arizona-2017-HB2417-Chaptered.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The State also identifies areas where blockchain technology should not be used. For instance, the new law adopted in 2017 prohibits the use of blockchain technology to locate or control firearms.&lt;ref&gt;Craig de Ridder, Mercedes Tunstall, Nathalie Prescott, 'Recognition of smart contracts in the United States' (2017) Intellectual Property and Technology Law Journal Vol 29 No 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;House Bill 2216 &lt;https://legiscan.com/AZ/text/HB2216/2017&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Nevada]] ===
In June 2017 similar legislation has been enacted in Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Higgins, 'Nevada Senators Unanimously Advance Blockchain Tax Ban' (Coindesk, 26 April 2017) &lt;https://www.coindesk.com/nevada-senators-blockchain-tax-ban/&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, "Nevada has become the first state to ban local governments from taxing blockchain use".&lt;ref&gt;Stan Higgins, 'Nevada Becomes First US State to Ban Blockchain Taxes' (Coindesk, 06 June 2017) &lt;https://www.coindesk.com/nevada-first-us-state-ban-blockchain-taxes/&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the definition of blockchain, the Nevada Senate defines it as "an electronic record created by the use of a decentralized method by multiple parties to verify and store a digital record of transactions which is secured by the use of a cryptographic hash of previous transaction information".&lt;ref&gt;Senate Bill No 389 &lt;https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/79th2017/Bills/SB/SB398.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Delaware]] ===
On August 1, 2017, Delaware's blockchain law became effective, which amends the Delaware General Corporation Law explicitly permitting the use of distributed ledger technology in the administration of Delaware corporate records, including records of stock and stockholders.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Dodge, 'Delaware Authorizes Stocks on Blockchain' (Proskauer, 02 August 2017) &lt;https://newmedialaw.proskauer.com/2017/08/02/delaware-authorizes-stocks-on-blockchain/&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Senate Bill No. 60 &lt;https://legiscan.com/DE/text/SB69/id/1627743/Delaware-2017-SB69-Draft.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; "Before this new law was adopted, there was nothing specifically stopping a Delaware corporation from using blockchain technology to keep track of its stockholders, but there was also a great deal of regulatory uncertainty."&lt;ref&gt;Cindy Dole and Doneld Shelkey 'Delaware Blockchain Law Goes into Effect' (Morgan Lewis, 11 August 2017) &lt;https://www.morganlewis.com/blogs/sourcingatmorganlewis/2017/08/delaware-blockchain-law-goes-into-effect&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== DLT and law issues ==

=== Issue of [[Situs (law)|situs]] and place for [[dispute resolution]] ===
In the legal context DLT and smart contracts are distinct and face their own problems and challenges. Issue of situs is an example which relates to DLT rather than smart contracts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Linklaters and ISDA, ‘Smart Contracts and Distributed Ledger – A Legal Perspective’ (2017) &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.isda.org/a/6EKDE/smart-contracts-and-distributed-ledger-a-legal-perspective.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; International private law and legislation of various jurisdictions require to identify the location of an asset or place of an agreement in order to solve conflict of law problem and determine the applicable governing law. "However, the distribution of the register across nodes in multiple jurisdictions raises a seemingly intractable problem – under current legal principles at least – as to where the situs should be."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Holding something on DLT, including smart contract or title to an asset, does not isolate it from the legal system and laws of respective jurisdiction. "Some blockchain enthusiasts may have misinterpreted the statement ‘code is law’ as implying that code can supersede the law or that decentralised networks create their own legal regimes."&lt;ref&gt;Eliza Mik, ‘Smart contracts: terminology, technical limitations and real world complexity” (2017) Law Innovation and Technology Vol 9 No 2, 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

In case of a dispute between the parties of the smart contract within the DLT, the issue arises where the distributed ledger is located in order to determine the place for dispute resolution.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Reggie O'Shields, 'Smart Contracts: Legal Agreements for the Blockchain' (2017) North Carolina Banking Institute Vol 21, 177.&lt;/ref&gt; "Blockchain also poses questions concerning the ability to identify the parties to a transaction, to the extent a system utilizing this technology remains anonymous, which may rise a host of additional issues related to dispute resolution."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Issue of legal validity and update of code on DLT ===
An absence of legal [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] mechanism on DLT, [[Smart contract|self-executing]] nature of code on DLT and [[Blockchain|limited ability]] to update the code if the law changes create a number of legal issues. There are several  possible solutions of addressing these issues. "One method could be a system in which the relevant jurisdiction creates a publicly available database and [[Application Programming Interface (API)|application programming interface (API)]] of relevant legal provisions. These would be provisions related to the terms of the contract. The smart contract would call these terms and would be able to update those provisions terms in accord with the jurisdiction's update of the database."&lt;ref&gt;Max Raskin, ‘The Law and Legality of Smart Contracts’ (2017) 1 Geo L Tech Rev 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

On more conservative side of DLT and law interaction spectrum are two solutions proposed by [https://www.hse.ru/en/org/persons/57906411 Alexander Savelyev]:

"(1) To introduce the concept of a ‘Superuser’ for government authorities, which will have a right to modify the content of Blockchain databases in accordance with a specified procedure in order to reflect the decisions of state authority.

{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}}
The '''Evolutionary Principle''' is a largely psychological doctrine which roughly states that when a [[species]] is removed from the [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] in which it [[evolution|evolved]], or that habitat changes significantly within a brief period (evolutionarily speaking), the species will develop maladaptive or outright [[wiktionary:pathological|pathological]] behavior. The Evolutionary Principle is important in [[Neo-Tribalism|neo-tribalist]] and [[anarcho-primitivist]] thinking.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8051">'''Feminist HCI''' is a subfield of [[human-computer interaction]] (commonly called HCI) that focuses on helping the field of  HCI build interactions that pay attention to [[gender]], [[Gender equality|equity]], and [[social justice]] in [[research]] and in the [[Design|design process]].

==Overview==
Feminist HCI sets a stage for the explicit inclusion of [[feminism]] in HCI. Starting with Shaowen Bardzell's 2010 article "Feminist HCI: Taking Stock and Outlining an Agenda for Design", feminist HCI looks to the design and evaluation of interactive computing systems from a [[feminism|feminist]] lens.&lt;ref name=Bardzell_1&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Bardzell|first1=Shaowen|title=Feminist HCI: Taking Stock and Outlining an Agenda for Design|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=2010|pages=1301–1310|doi=10.1145/1753326.1753521|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1753521|isbn=9781605589299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building off of the epistemology of [[Standpoint feminism|feminist standpoint theory]], feminist HCI is focused on highlighting the values feminism in HCI work, like equity, diversity, and social justice, as well as on understanding the relationship gender has to the design and evaluation of interactive systems. Given that feminism is a heterogeneous concept, there is no singular methodology for undertaking feminist HCI projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Bardzell|first1=Shaowen|last2=Bardzell|first2=Jeffrey|title=Towards a Feminist HCI Methodology: Social Science, Feminism, and HCI|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=2011|pages=675–684|doi=10.1145/1978942.1979041|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1979041|isbn=9781450302289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bridging the gap between feminism and HCI, Feminist HCI has applications in theory, methodology, user research, and evaluation that will allow practitioners to critique systems already in place as well as generate new HCI practices focused on gender, equity, and social justice. Theoretical contributions of feminism like the [[Feminist technoscience|masculinity of technology]] and the [[Social construction of gender|social production of gender]] point towards the importance of addressing gender and equity directly in HCI.&lt;ref name=Rode&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rode|first1=Jennifer A.|title=A theoretical agenda for feminist HCI|journal=Interacting with Computers|date=2011|volume=23|issue=5|pages=393–400|url=https://academic.oup.com/iwc/article-abstract/23/5/393/653472|doi=10.1016/j.intcom.2011.04.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualities of feminist interaction==
Building off of interaction design, Feminist HCI builds on six core qualities to feminist interaction:&lt;ref name="Bardzell_1" /&gt;
* '''[[Pluralism (political philosophy)|Pluralism]]''': Building on [[Standpoint feminism|feminist standpoint theory]], this quality argues that human experience is too varied to be captured within the concept of [[universalism]], thus pluralism, or heterogeneity, in design is of critical importance to HCI work.  
* '''[[Participation (decision making)|Participation]]''': Engaging users as active contributors to the design process (e.g., [[participatory design]]) is important for understanding and respecting the full range of contributions users can make. Feminist HCI argues that this work should occur alongside traditional [[usability testing]].  
* '''[[Advocacy]]''': Articulating concerns with the values that get built into a design by championing for well-motivated of ideas for creating just design choices. For instance, a [[needs analysis]] may reinforce discriminatory design behavior like design choices criticized by [[Gender HCI]]. Participatory approaches, like [[participatory design]], support advocacy.
* '''[[Human ecology|Ecology]]''': Maintaining a focus on the larger social structures (ecosystems) that a design impacts throughout the process of development. For example, the way a house is designed has an impact on structuring the lives of people who live in it (see [[feminism and modern architecture]] for additional information). Likewise, HCI artifacts exist within a larger ecosystem that impacts both the design process and the user. 
* '''[[Embodied embedded cognition|Embodiment]]''': Contrasting from earlier HCI notions of a disembodied user (such as [[Human–computer interaction#Mental model principles|mental models]]), concentrating on the material attributes of human-computer interactions is essential for understanding the way differences and commonalities impact interaction. 
* '''[[Reflexivity (social theory)|Self-disclosure]]''': Bringing to light the foundational assumptions inherent in everyday design allows us to understand how well the design model of a user matches the actual users.

==Select feminist HCI findings==
The following presents a sampling of results from research utilizing feminist HCI:

*''Six qualities of feminist interaction in an activist [[online community]].''
** Jill Dimond et al.'s studies of [[Hollaback!]] outlines how activist [[Computer-supported cooperative work|CSCW]] systems embody Feminist HCI in concrete ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dimond|first1=Jill|title=Feminist HCI for real: Designing technology in support of a social movement|date=2012|url=https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/45778|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|hdl=1853/45778}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Dimond|first1=Jill P.|last2=Dye|first2=Michaelanne|last3=Larose|first3=Daphne|last4=Bruckman|first4=Amy S.|title=Hollaback!: The Role of Storytelling Online in a Social Movement Organization|journal=Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work|date=2013|pages=477–490|doi=10.1145/2441776.2441831|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2441831|isbn=9781450313315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, these studies examine feminist HCI through activist online communities describing how the six qualities of feminist interaction design play out in the work and experiences of site designers and site users.
*''Designing [[postpartum]] technologies by and for mothers using feminist HCI.''
** Catherine D'Ignazio et al.'s work highlights participation, advocacy, and ecology to improve [[breast pump]] technologies. By getting input from more than 1000 mothers, researchers put forth a number of improvements that could be made to the breast pump while discussing the wider impacts this type of research can make on improving postpartum technologies broadly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=D'Ignazio|first1=Catherine|last2=Hope|first2=Alexis|last3=Michelson|first3=Becky|last4=Churchill|first4=Robyn|last5=Zuckerman|first5=Ethan|title=A Feminist HCI Approach to Designing Postpartum Technologies: "When I First Saw a Breast Pump I Was Wondering if It Was a Joke"|journal=Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=2016|pages=2612–2622|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2858460|doi=10.1145/2858036.2858460|isbn=9781450333627}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Exploring implementation feminist HCI qualities in design when the users of a site design it themselves.''
** Casey Fiesler et al.'s work details how an online [[fan fiction]] community, consisting mostly of women, designed their own site. This site, [[Archive of Our Own]], embedded the values most important to the community, such as [[accessibility]], an embodiment of the feminist design quality pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Fiesler|first1=Casey|last2=Morrison|first2=Shannon|last3=Bruckman|first3=Amy S.|title=An Archive of Their Own: A Case Study of Feminist HCI and Values in Design|journal=Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=2016|pages=2574–2585|doi=10.1145/2858036.2858409|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2858409|isbn=9781450333627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Generative systems''' are technologies with the overall capacity to produce unprompted change driven by large, varied, and uncoordinated audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Zittrain|first=Jonathan |last2= |first2= |date= May 2006|title=The Generative Internet |jstor= 4093608 |journal= Harvard Law Review|publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When generative systems provide a common platform, changes may occur at varying layers (physical, network, application, content) and provide a means through which different firms and individuals may cooperate indirectly and contribute to innovation.&lt;ref name="TeiglandPower2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robin Teigland|author2=Dominic Power|title=The Immersive Internet: Reflections on the Entangling of the Virtual with Society, Politics and the Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T5mx4Ei2cHwC&amp;pg=PA204|date=25 March 2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-28302-3|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the rules, the patterns can be extremely varied and unpredictable.  One of the more well-known examples is [[Conway's Game of Life]], a [[cellular automaton]]. Another example is [[Boids]]. More examples can be found in [[generative music]], [[generative art]], and, more recently, in video games such as [[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]].

The '''Human Race Machine''' (HRM) is a [[computer graphics|computerized]] [[System console|console]] composed of four different programs. The Human Race Machine program allows participants to see themselves with the facial characteristics of six different [[racial group|races]]: [[Asian people|Asian]], [[White people|White]], [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]], [[Middle Eastern]], and [[India]]n, mapped onto their own face.  The Age Machine allows viewers see an aged version of his or her face. A version of this methodology has been used for over twenty years by the [[FBI]] and the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] to help locate kidnap victims and missing children. The Couples Machine combines photographs of two people in different percentages to show the appearance of their child. The Anomaly Machine lets viewers see themselves with facial anomalies. The HRM was created by [[artist]] [[Nancy Burson]] and David Kramlich; it uses [[morphing]] technology.  It was shown on [[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]] on 2006-02-16.

[[File:ThreeGorgesDam-China2009.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|The [[Three Gorges Dam]] in Central China is the [[List of largest power stations in the world#Top 20 largest power producing facilities|world's largest]] power producing facility of any kind.]]
{{Sustainable energy}}

'''Hydroelectricity''' is [[Electricity generation|electricity produced]] from [[hydropower]]. In 2015, hydropower generated 16.6% of the world's total electricity and 70% of all [[renewable energy|renewable electricity]],&lt;ref name="ren21.net"&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and was expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years.

Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the [[Asia-Pacific]] region generating 33 percent of global hydropower in 2013. [[China]] is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 920 TWh of production in 2013, representing 16.9 percent of domestic electricity use.

The cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low, making it a competitive source of renewable electricity. The hydro station consumes no water, unlike coal or gas plants. The average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 [[megawatt]]s is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per [[kilowatt-hour]].&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; With a dam and reservoir it is also a flexible source of electricity since the amount produced by the station can be changed up or down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands. Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, the project produces no direct waste, and in many cases, has a considerably lower output level of [[greenhouse gas]]es than [[fossil fuel]] powered energy plants.&lt;ref name="REN21-2011"&gt;[http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR2011_FINAL.pdf Renewables 2011 Global Status Report, page 25, Hydropower], ''[[REN21]]'', published 2011, accessed 2016-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydropower has been used since ancient times to grind flour and perform other tasks. In the mid-1770s, French engineer [[Bernard Forest de Bélidor]] published ''Architecture Hydraulique'' which described vertical- and horizontal-axis hydraulic machines. By the late 19th century, the [[electrical generator]] was developed and could now be coupled with hydraulics.&lt;ref name="doehis"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/history-hydropower|title=History of Hydropower|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing demand for the [[Industrial Revolution]] would drive development as well.&lt;ref name="watenc"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878 the world's first hydroelectric power scheme was developed at [[Cragside]] in [[Northumberland]], England by [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]]. It was used to power a single [[arc lamp]] in his art gallery.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The old [[Robert Moses Niagara Hydroelectric Power Station#Origins|Schoelkopf Power Station No. 1]] near [[Niagara Falls]] in the U.S. side began to produce electricity in 1881. The first [[Thomas Alva Edison|Edison]] hydroelectric power station, the [[Vulcan Street Plant]], began operating September 30, 1882, in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], with an output of about 12.5 kilowatts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.clara.net/darvill/altenerg/hydro.htm|title= Hydroelectric power - energy from falling water|publisher=Clara.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1886 there were 45 hydroelectric power stations in the U.S. and Canada. By 1889 there were 200 in the U.S. alone.&lt;ref name="doehis"/&gt;

[[File:Warwick Castle - Engine House, Waterwheel, Weir, and Old Castle Bridge.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Warwick Castle]] water-powered generator house, used for the generation of electricity for the castle from 1894 until 1940]]
At the beginning of the 20th century, many small hydroelectric power stations were being constructed by commercial companies in mountains near metropolitan areas. [[Grenoble]], France held the [[International Exhibition of Hydropower and Tourism]] with over one million visitors. By 1920 as 40% of the power produced in the United States was hydroelectric, the [[Federal Power Act]] was enacted into law. The Act created the [[Federal Power Commission]] to regulate hydroelectric power stations on federal land and water. As the power stations became larger, their associated dams developed additional purposes to include [[flood control]], [[irrigation]] and [[navigable|navigation]]. Federal funding became necessary for large-scale development and federally owned corporations, such as the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (1933) and the [[Bonneville Power Administration]] (1937) were created.&lt;ref name="watenc"/&gt; Additionally, the [[Bureau of Reclamation]] which had begun a series of western U.S. irrigation projects in the early 20th century was now constructing large hydroelectric projects such as the 1928 [[Boulder Canyon Project Act|Hoover Dam]].&lt;ref name="act"&gt;{{cite web|title=Boulder Canyon Project Act|url=http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g1000/pdfiles/bcpact.pdf|date=December 21, 1928|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613142851/http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g1000/pdfiles/bcpact.pdf|archivedate=June 13, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] was also involved in hydroelectric development, completing the [[Bonneville Dam]] in 1937 and being recognized by the [[Flood Control Act of 1936]] as the premier federal flood control agency.&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;[http://www.usace.army.mil/publications/eng-pamphlets/ep870-1-29/entire.pdf The Evolution of the Flood Control Act of 1936, Joseph L.

Hydroelectric power stations continued to become larger throughout the 20th century. Hydropower was referred to as ''white coal'' for its power and plenty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Book of Knowledge|volume=Vol. 9|page=3220|edition=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hoover Dam]]'s initial 1,345 MW power station was the world's largest hydroelectric power station in 1936; it was eclipsed by the 6809 MW [[Grand Coulee Dam]] in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a2zlasvegas.com/otherside/sights/hoover.html|title=Hoover Dam and Lake Mead|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Reclamation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Itaipu Dam]] opened in 1984 in South America as the largest, producing 14,000 MW but was surpassed in 2008 by the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China at 22,500 MW. Hydroelectricity would eventually supply some countries, including [[Norway]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Brazil]], with over 85% of their electricity. The United States currently has over 2,000 hydroelectric power stations that supply 6.4% of its total electrical production output, which is 49% of its renewable electricity.&lt;ref name="watenc"/&gt;

==Future potential==
The technical potential for the growth of hydropower around the world are, 71% Europe, 75% North America, 79% South America, 95% Africa, 95% Middle East, 82% Asia Pacific. 
The political realities of new reservoirs in western countries, economic limitations in the third world and the lack of a transmission system in undeveloped areas, result in the possibility of developing 25% of the remaining potential before 2050, with the bulk of that being in the Asia Pacific area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/hydropower_essentials.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A few countries are highly developed and have very little room for growth, Switzerland 12% and Mexico 20%.

[[File:Water turbine - edit1.svg|thumb|A typical [[Water turbine|turbine]] and [[electrical generator|generator]]]]

===Conventional (dams)===
{{See also|List of conventional hydroelectric power stations}}

Most hydroelectric power comes from the [[potential energy]] of [[dam]]med water driving a [[water turbine]] and [[electric generator|generator]]. The power extracted from the water depends on the volume and on the difference in height between the source and the water's outflow. This height difference is called the [[head (hydraulic)|head]]. A large pipe (the "[[penstock]]") delivers water from the [[reservoir]] to the turbine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electricityforum.com/hydroelectricity.html|title=hydro electricity - explained|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pumped-storage===
{{Main article|Pumped-storage hydroelectricity}}
{{See also|List of pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations}}

This method produces electricity to supply high peak demands by moving water between [[reservoir]]s at different elevations. At times of low electrical demand, the excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the higher reservoir. When the demand becomes greater, water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine. Pumped-storage schemes currently provide the most commercially important means of large-scale [[grid energy storage]] and improve the daily [[capacity factor]] of the generation system. Pumped storage is not an energy source, and appears as a negative number in listings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesouthslope.com/content/pumped-storage-explained Pumped Storage, Explained] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231233454/http://thesouthslope.com/content/pumped-storage-explained |date=2012-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Run-of-the-river===
{{Main article|Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity}}
{{See also|List of run-of-the-river hydroelectric power stations}}

Run-of-the-river hydroelectric stations are those with small or no reservoir capacity, so that only the water coming from upstream is available for generation at that moment, and any oversupply must pass unused. A constant supply of water from a lake or existing reservoir upstream is a significant advantage in choosing sites for run-of-the-river. In the United States, run of the river hydropower could potentially provide {{convert|60000|MW}} (about 13.7% of total use in 2011 if continuously available).&lt;!--total use in 2011 was 3841 billion kWh from Annual Energy Outlook http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/er/ --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2012/01/run-of-the-river-hydropower-goes-with-the-flow|title=Run-of-the-River Hydropower Goes With the Flow|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tide===
{{Main article|Tide power}}
{{See also|List of tidal power stations}}

A [[tidal power]] station makes use of the daily rise and fall of ocean water due to tides; such sources are highly predictable, and if conditions permit construction of reservoirs, can also be [[Dispatchable generation|dispatchable]] to generate power during high demand periods. Less common types of hydro schemes use water's [[kinetic energy]] or undammed sources such as undershot [[water wheel]]s. Tidal power is viable in a relatively small number of locations around the world. In Great Britain, there are eight sites that could be developed, which 
have the potential to generate 20% of the electricity used in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darvill.clara.net/altenerg/tidal.htm|title=Energy Resources: Tidal power|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sizes, types and capacities of hydroelectric facilities==

=== Large facilities ===
{{See also|List of largest power stations in the world|List of largest hydroelectric power stations}}

Large-scale hydroelectric power stations are more commonly seen as the largest power producing facilities in the world, with some hydroelectric facilities capable of generating more than double the installed capacities of the current [[List of nuclear power stations|largest nuclear power stations]].

Although no official definition exists for the capacity range of large hydroelectric power stations, facilities from over a few hundred [[megawatt]]s are generally considered large hydroelectric facilities.

Currently, only four facilities over {{nowrap|10 [[Gigawatt|GW]]}} ({{nowrap|10,000 [[Megawatt|MW]]}}) are in operation worldwide, see table below.&lt;ref name=wi2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |title=Use and Capacity of Global Hydropower Increases |author=Worldwatch Institute |date=January 2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

===Small===
{{Main article|Small hydro}}

Small hydro is the development of [[hydroelectric power]] on a scale serving a small community or industrial plant. The definition of a small hydro project varies but a generating capacity of up to 10 [[megawatt]]s (MW) is generally accepted as the upper limit of what can be termed small hydro. This may be stretched to 25 MW and 30 MW in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. Small-scale hydroelectricity production grew by 29% from 2005 to 2008, raising the total world small-hydro capacity to {{nowrap|85 [[Gigawatt|GW]]}}. Over 70% of this was in [[China]] ({{nowrap|65 GW}}), followed by [[Japan]] ({{nowrap|3.5 GW}}), the United States ({{nowrap|3 GW}}), and [[India]] ({{nowrap|2 GW}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf Renewables Global Status Report 2006 Update] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718181410/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf |date=July 18, 2011 }}, ''[[REN21]]'', published 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nw vietnam hydro.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A micro-hydro facility in [[Vietnam]]]]
[[File:Amateur Hydroelectricity.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Pico hydroelectricity in [[Mondulkiri]], [[Cambodia]]]]
Small hydro stations may be connected to conventional electrical distribution networks as a source of low-cost renewable energy. Alternatively, small hydro projects may be built in isolated areas that would be uneconomic to serve from a network, or in areas where there is no national electrical distribution network. Since small hydro projects usually have minimal reservoirs and civil construction work, they are seen as having a relatively low environmental impact compared to large hydro. This decreased environmental impact depends strongly on the balance between stream flow and power production.

===Micro===
{{Main article|Micro hydro}}

Micro hydro is a term used for [[hydroelectric power]] installations that typically produce up to {{nowrap|100 [[Kilowatt|kW]]}} of power. These installations can provide power to an isolated home or small community, or are sometimes connected to electric power networks. There are many of these installations around the world, particularly in developing nations as they can provide an economical source of energy without purchase of fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tve.org/ho/doc.cfm?aid=1636&amp;lang=English |title=Micro Hydro in the fight against poverty |publisher=Tve.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426092643/http://tve.org/ho/doc.cfm?aid=1636&amp;lang=English |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Micro hydro systems complement [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] solar energy systems because in many areas, water flow, and thus available hydro power, is highest in the winter when solar energy is at a minimum.

===Pico===
{{Main article|Pico hydro}}

Pico hydro is a term used for [[hydroelectric power]] generation of under {{nowrap|5 [[Kilowatt|kW]]}}. It is useful in small, remote communities that require only a small amount of electricity. For example, to power one or two fluorescent light bulbs and a TV or radio for a few homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.t4cd.org/Resources/ICT_Resources/Projects/Pages/ICTProject_287.aspx|title=Pico Hydro Power|publisher=T4cd.org|accessdate=2010-07-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731064419/http://www.t4cd.org/Resources/ICT_Resources/Projects/Pages/ICTProject_287.aspx|archivedate=2009-07-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even smaller turbines of 200-300W may power a single home in a developing country with a drop of only {{Convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. A Pico-hydro setup is typically [[#Run-of-the-river|run-of-the-river]], meaning that dams are not used, but rather pipes divert some of the flow, drop this down a gradient, and through the turbine before returning it to the stream.

===Underground===
{{Main article|Underground power station}}

An [[underground power station]] is generally used at large facilities and makes use of a large natural height difference between two waterways, such as a waterfall or mountain lake. An underground tunnel is constructed to take water from the high reservoir to the generating hall built in an underground cavern near the lowest point of the water tunnel and a horizontal tailrace taking water away to the lower outlet waterway.[[File:Tailrace-Forebay-Limestone.JPG|thumb|Measurement of the tailrace and forebay rates at the [[Limestone Generating Station]] in [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]].]]

===Calculating available power===
{{Main article|Hydropower}}
A simple formula for approximating electric power production at a hydroelectric station is: &lt;math&gt; P = \rho hrgk &lt;/math&gt;, where
*&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is Power in watts,
*&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density of water (~1000&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;),
*&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is height in meters,
*&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is flow rate in cubic meters per second,
*&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is acceleration due to [[gravity]] of 9.8&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,
*&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a coefficient of efficiency ranging from 0 to 1. Efficiency is often higher (that is, closer to 1) with larger and more modern turbines.

Annual electric energy production depends on the available water supply. In some installations, the water flow rate can vary by a factor of 10:1 over the course of a year.

==Properties==

===Advantages===
[[File:Stwlan.dam.jpg|thumb|The [[Ffestiniog Power Station]] can generate {{nowrap|360 [[Megawatt|MW]]}} of electricity within 60 seconds of the demand arising.]]

====Flexibility====
Hydropower is a flexible source of electricity since stations can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; Hydro turbines have a start-up time of the order of a few minutes.&lt;ref name="Huggins2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert A. Huggins|title=Energy Storage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nn5y9gQeIlwC&amp;pg=PA60|date=1 September 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4419-1023-3|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes around 60 to 90 seconds to bring a unit from cold start-up to full load; this is much shorter than for gas turbines or steam plants.&lt;ref name="SusskindRaseman1970"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Herbert Susskind|author2=Chad J. Raseman|title=Combined Hydroelectric Pumped Storage and Nuclear Power Generation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zbu5m1Een2sC|year=1970|publisher=Brookhaven National Laboratory|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Power generation can also be decreased quickly when there is a surplus power generation.&lt;ref name="Sørensen2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bent Sørensen|title=Renewable Energy: Its Physics, Engineering, Use, Environmental Impacts, Economy, and Planning Aspects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y17FoN2VUEwC&amp;pg=PA556|year=2004|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-656153-1|pages=556–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the limited capacity of hydropower units is not generally used to produce base power except for vacating the flood pool or meeting downstream needs.&lt;ref name="(U.S.)1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geological Survey (U.S.)|title=Geological Survey Professional Paper|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=37dUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA10|year=1980|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it serves as backup for non-hydro generators.&lt;ref name="Sørensen2004" /&gt;

====Low cost/high value power====
The major advantage of conventional hydroelectric dams with reservoirs is their ability to store water at low cost for [[Dispatchable generation|dispatch later]] as high value clean electricity. The average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; When used as peak power to meet demand, hydroelectricity has a higher value than base power and a much higher value compared to [[intermittent energy source]]s.

Hydroelectric stations have long economic lives, with some plants still in service after 50–100 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reme.epfl.ch/webdav/site/reme/users/106542/public/SHS4/Gr01.pdf Hydropower – A Way of Becoming Independent of Fossil Energy?]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528070938/http://reme.epfl.ch/webdav/site/reme/users/106542/public/SHS4/Gr01.pdf |date=28 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Operating labor cost is also usually low, as plants are automated and have few personnel on site during normal operation.

Where a dam serves multiple purposes, a hydroelectric station may be added with relatively low construction cost, providing a useful revenue stream to offset the costs of dam operation. It has been calculated that the sale of electricity from the [[Three Gorges Dam]] will cover the construction costs after 5 to 8 years of full generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterpowermagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2041318 |title=Beyond Three Gorges in China |publisher=Waterpowermagazine.com |date=2007-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614050746/http://www.waterpowermagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2041318 |archivedate=2011-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some data shows that in most countries large hydropower dams will be too costly and take too long to build to deliver a positive risk adjusted return, unless appropriate risk management measures are put in place.&lt;ref&gt;(http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2406852), Should We Build More Large Dams? The Actual Costs of Hydropower Megaproject Development, Energy Policy, March 2014, pp. 1-14&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suitability for industrial applications====
While many hydroelectric projects supply public electricity networks, some are created to serve specific [[industry|industrial]] enterprises. Dedicated hydroelectric projects are often built to provide the substantial amounts of electricity needed for [[aluminium]] electrolytic plants, for example. The [[Grand Coulee Dam]] switched to support [[Alcoa]] aluminium in [[Bellingham, Washington]], [[United States]] for American [[World War II]] airplanes before it was allowed to provide irrigation and power to citizens (in addition to aluminium power) after the war. In [[Suriname]], the [[Brokopondo Reservoir]] was constructed to provide electricity for the [[Alcoa]] aluminium industry. [[New Zealand]]'s [[Manapouri Power Station]] was constructed to supply electricity to the [[aluminium]] [[smelter]] at [[Comalco|Tiwai Point]].

====Reduced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions====
Since hydroelectric dams do not use fuel, power generation does not produce [[carbon dioxide]].  While carbon dioxide is initially produced during construction of the project, and some methane is given off annually by reservoirs, hydro in specific nordic cases, has the lowest [[Greenhouse gas#Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions]] for power generation.&lt;ref&gt;Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions pg19&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to fossil fuels generating an equivalent amount of electricity, hydro displaced three billion tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/topics/renewables/subtopics/hydropower/&lt;/ref&gt; One measurement of greenhouse gas related and other externality comparison between energy sources can be found in the ExternE project by the [[Paul Scherrer Institute]] and the [[University of Stuttgart]] which was funded by the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref name="ExternEFTR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.externe.info/expoltec.pdf |title=Final Technical Report, Version 2 |author=Rabl A. et. al. |date=August 2005 |work=Externalities of Energy: Extension of Accounting Framework and Policy Applications |publisher=European Commission |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307120342/http://www.externe.info/expoltec.pdf |archivedate=March 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to that study, hydroelectricity in Europe produces the least amount of [[greenhouse gases]] and [[externality]] of any energy source.&lt;ref name="ExternEGraphs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gabe.web.psi.ch/projects/externe_pol/index.html|title=External costs of electricity systems (graph format)|year=2005|publisher=Technology Assessment / GaBE ([[Paul Scherrer Institut]])|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101201452/http://gabe.web.psi.ch/projects/externe_pol/index.html|archive-date=1 November 2013|dead-url=|work=ExternE-Pol}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coming in second place was [[wind energy|wind]], third was [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], and fourth was [[solar energy|solar]] [[photovoltaic]].&lt;ref name="ExternEGraphs"/&gt; The low [[greenhouse gas]] impact of hydroelectricity is found especially in [[temperate climate]]s. The above study was for local energy in [[Europe]]; presumably similar conditions prevail in North America and Northern Asia, which all see a regular, natural freeze/thaw cycle (with associated seasonal plant decay and regrowth). Greater greenhouse gas emission impacts are found in the tropical regions because the reservoirs of power stations in tropical regions produce a larger amount of [[methane]] than those in temperate areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v4/n9/full/ngeo1226.html|title=Climate science: Renewable but not carbon-free|first=Bernhard|last=Wehrli|date=1 September 2011|publisher=|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=4|issue=9|pages=585–586|via=www.nature.com|doi=10.1038/ngeo1226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other uses of the reservoir====
Reservoirs created by hydroelectric schemes often provide facilities for [[List of water sports|water sports]], and become tourist attractions themselves. In some countries, [[aquaculture]] in reservoirs is common. [[Multipurpose reservoir|Multi-use dams]] installed for [[irrigation]] support [[agriculture]] with a relatively constant water supply. Large hydro dams can control floods, which would otherwise affect people living downstream of the project.&lt;ref name="Water: Science and Issues"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Atkins|first=William|title=Hydroelectric Power|journal=Water: Science and Issues|year=2003|volume=2|pages=187–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
{{see also|Renewable energy debate#Disadvantages of hydroelectricity}}

====Ecosystem damage and loss of land====
[[File:MeroweDam01.jpg|thumb|[[Merowe Dam]] in [[Sudan]]. Hydroelectric power stations that use [[dam]]s submerge large areas of land due to the requirement of a [[reservoir]]. These changes to land color or [[albedo]], alongside certain projects that concurrently submerge rainforests, can in these specific cases, result in the global warming impact, or equivalent [[Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|life-cycle greenhouse gases]] of hydroelectricity projects, to exceed that of coal power stations.]]

Large reservoirs associated with traditional hydroelectric power stations result in submersion of extensive areas upstream of the dams, sometimes destroying biologically rich and productive lowland and riverine valley forests, marshland and grasslands. Damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems, and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; The loss of land is often exacerbated by [[habitat fragmentation]] of surrounding areas caused by the reservoir.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robbins|first=Paul|title=Hydropower|journal=Encyclopedia of Environment and Society|year=2007|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydroelectric projects can be disruptive to surrounding aquatic [[ecosystem]]s both upstream and downstream of the plant site. Generation of hydroelectric power changes the downstream river environment. Water exiting a turbine usually contains very little suspended sediment, which can lead to scouring of river beds and loss of riverbanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internationalrivers.org/en/node/1476|title=Sedimentation Problems with Dams|publisher=Internationalrivers.org|accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since turbine gates are often opened intermittently, rapid or even daily fluctuations in river flow are observed.

====Water loss by evaporation====
A 2011 study by the United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory concluded that hydroelectric plants in the U.S. consumed between 1,425 and 18,000 gallons of water per megawatt-hour (gal/MWh) of electricity generated, through evaporation losses in the reservoir. The median loss was 4,491 gal/MWh, which is higher than the loss for generation technologies that use cooling towers, including concentrating solar power (865 gal/MWh for CSP trough, 786 gal/MWh for CSP tower), coal (687 gal/MWh), nuclear (672 gal/MWh), and natural gas (198 gal/MWh). Where there are multiple uses of reservoirs such as water supply, recreation, and flood control,  all reservoir evaporation is attributed to power production.&lt;ref&gt;John Macknick and others, [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/50900.pdf A Review of Operational Water Consumption and Withdrawal Factors for Electricity Generating Technologies], National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Technical Report NREL/TP-6A20-50900.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Siltation and flow shortage====
When water flows it has the ability to transport particles heavier than itself downstream. This has a negative effect on dams and subsequently their power stations, particularly those on rivers or within catchment areas with high siltation. [[Siltation]] can fill a reservoir and reduce its capacity to control floods along with causing additional horizontal pressure on the upstream portion of the dam. Eventually, some reservoirs can become full of sediment and useless or over-top during a flood and fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patrick James|first=H Chansen|title=Teaching Case Studies in Reservoir Siltation and Catchment Erosion|url=http://www.ijee.dit.ie/articles/Vol14-4/ijee1012.pdf|publisher=TEMPUS Publications|location=Great Britain|pages=265–275|year=1998|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902184753/http://www.ijee.dit.ie/articles/Vol14-4/ijee1012.pdf|archivedate=2009-09-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Șentürk|first=Fuat|title=Hydraulics of dams and reservoirs|year=1994|publisher=Water Resources Publications|location=Highlands Ranch, Colo.|isbn=0-918334-80-2|edition=reference.|page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in the amount of river flow will correlate with the amount of energy produced by a dam. Lower river flows will reduce the amount of live storage in a reservoir therefore reducing the amount of water that can be used for hydroelectricity. The result of diminished river flow can be power shortages in areas that depend heavily on hydroelectric power. The risk of flow shortage may increase as a result of [[climate change]].&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Frauke Urban and Tom Mitchell 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation Climate change, disasters and electricity generation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920024704/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation |date=September 20, 2012 }}. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]] and [[Institute of Development Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt; One study from the [[Colorado River]] in the United States suggest that modest climate changes, such as an increase in temperature in 2 degree Celsius resulting in a 10% decline in precipitation, might reduce river run-off by up to 40%.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; [[Brazil]] in particular is vulnerable due to its heavy reliance on hydroelectricity, as increasing temperatures, lower water ﬂow and alterations in the rainfall regime, could reduce total energy production by 7% annually by the end of the century.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

====Methane emissions (from reservoirs)====
[[File:Hoover Dam Nevada Luftaufnahme.jpg|thumb|The [[Hoover Dam]] in the [[United States]] is a large conventional dammed-hydro facility, with an installed capacity of {{nowrap|2,080 [[Megawatt|MW]]}}.]]

{{See also|Environmental impacts of reservoirs}}

Lower positive impacts are found in the tropical regions, as it has been noted that the reservoirs of power plants in tropical regions produce substantial amounts of [[methane]]. This is due to plant material in flooded areas decaying in an [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] environment, and forming methane, a [[greenhouse gas]]. According to the [[World Commission on Dams]] report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dams.org/report/|title=WCD Findal Report|publisher=Dams.org|date=2000-11-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821120709/http://www.dams.org/report/|archivedate=2013-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the reservoir is large compared to the generating capacity (less than 100 watts per square metre of surface area) and no clearing of the forests in the area was undertaken prior to impoundment of the reservoir, greenhouse gas emissions from the reservoir may be higher than those of a conventional oil-fired thermal generation plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7046|title=Hydroelectric power's dirty secret revealed|publisher=Newscientist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Boreal forest|boreal]] reservoirs of Canada and Northern Europe, however, [[Greenhouse gas#Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|greenhouse gas emissions]] are typically only 2% to 8% of any kind of conventional fossil-fuel thermal generation. A new class of underwater logging operation that targets drowned forests can mitigate the effect of forest decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/2006/12/01/rediscovered-wood-the-triton-sawfish/#more-1973|title="Rediscovered" Wood &amp; The Triton Sawfish|publisher=Inhabitat|date=2006-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relocation====
Another disadvantage of hydroelectric dams is the need to relocate the people living where the reservoirs are planned. In 2000, the World Commission on Dams estimated that dams had physically displaced 40-80 million people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internationalrivers.org/en/way-forward/world-commission-dams/world-commission-dams-framework-brief-introduction|title=Briefing of World Commission on Dams|publisher=Internationalrivers.org|date=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Failure risks====
{{See also|Dam failure|List of hydroelectric power station failures}}

Because large conventional dammed-hydro facilities hold back large volumes of water, a failure due to poor construction, natural disasters or sabotage can be catastrophic to downriver settlements and infrastructure.

During Typhoon Nina in 1975 [[Banqiao Dam]] failed in Southern China when more than a year's worth of rain fell within 24 hours. The resulting flood resulted in the deaths of 26,000 people, and another 145,000 from epidemics. Millions were left homeless.

The creation of a dam in a geologically inappropriate location may cause disasters such as 1963 disaster at [[Vajont Dam]] in Italy, where almost 2,000 people died.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;References may be found in the list of [[Dam failure]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Malpasset Dam]] failure in [[Fréjus]] on the [[French Riviera]] (Côte d'Azur), southern France, collapsed on December 2, 1959, killing 423 people in the resulting flood.&lt;ref&gt;http://ecolo.org/documents/documents_in_french/malpasset/malpasset.htm retrieved 02sep2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller dams and [[micro hydro]] facilities create less risk, but can form continuing hazards even after being decommissioned. For example, the small earthen embankment [[Kelly Barnes Dam]] failed in 1977, twenty years after its power station was decommissioned; causing 39 deaths.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[http://ga.water.usgs.gov/news/historical-toccoa/ Toccoa Flood] USGS Historical Site, retrieved 02sep2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison and interactions with other methods of power generation===
Hydroelectricity eliminates the [[flue gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion]], including pollutants such as [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitric oxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], dust, and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] in the [[coal]]. Hydroelectricity also avoids the hazards of [[coal mining]] and the indirect health effects of coal emissions.

====Nuclear power====

Compared to [[nuclear power]], hydroelectricity construction requires altering large areas of the environment while a nuclear power station has a small footprint, and hydro-powerstation failures have caused tens of thousands of more deaths than any nuclear station failure.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; The creation of [[Garrison Dam]], for example, required Native American land to create Lake Sakakawea, which has a shoreline of 1,320 miles, and caused the inhabitants to sell 94% of their arable land for $7.5 million in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Michael L. (1982). ''Dammed Indians: the Pick-Sloan Plan and the Missouri River Sioux, 1944–1980''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, nuclear power is relatively inflexible; although nuclear power can reduce its output reasonably quickly. Since the cost of nuclear power is dominated by its high infrastructure costs, the cost per unit energy goes up significantly with low production. Because of this, nuclear power is mostly used for [[baseload]]. By way of contrast, hydroelectricity can supply peak power at much lower cost. Hydroelectricity is thus often used to complement nuclear or other sources for [[load following]]. Country examples were they are paired in a close to 50/50 share include [[Electricity sector in Switzerland|the electric grid in Switzerland]],  the [[Electricity sector in Sweden]] and to a lesser extent, [[Energy in Ukraine#Electricity|Ukraine]] and the [[Electricity sector in Finland]].

====Wind power====

[[Wind power]] goes through predictable [[Variable renewable energy|variation]] by season, but is [[Intermittent energy source|intermittent]] on a daily basis. Maximum wind generation has little relationship to peak daily electricity consumption, the wind may peak at night when power isn't needed or be still during the day when electrical demand is highest. Occasionally weather patterns can result in low wind for days or weeks at a time, a hydroelectric reservoir capable of storing weeks of output is useful to balance generation on the grid. Peak wind power can be offset by minimum hydropower and minimum wind can be offset with maximum hydropower. In this way the easily regulated character of hydroelectricity is used to compensate for the intermittent nature of wind power. Conversely, in some cases wind power can be used to spare water for later use in dry seasons.

In areas that do not have hydropower, [[pumped storage]] serves a similar role, but at a much higher cost and 20% lower efficiency. An example of this is [[Electricity sector in Norway|Norway's trading]] with [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]] and possibly [[Germany]] or the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in the future.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sintef.no/en/latest-news/norway-is-europes-cheapest-battery/&lt;/ref&gt; Norway is 98% hydropower, while it's flatland neighbors are installing wind power.

==World hydroelectric capacity==

[[File:Top 5 Hydropower-Producing Countries.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Trends in the top five hydroelectricity-producing countries]]

{{See also|List of countries by electricity production from renewable sources|Cost of electricity by source}}
{{See also|Category:Hydroelectricity by country}}

The ranking of hydro-electric capacity is either by actual annual energy production or by installed capacity power rating. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity.&lt;ref name="ren21.net"/&gt;
Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generated 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Paraguay]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Venezuela]] have a majority of the internal electric energy production from hydroelectric power. [[Paraguay]] produces 100% of its electricity from hydroelectric dams, and exports 90% of its production to Brazil and to Argentina. [[Norway]] produces 98–99% of its electricity from hydroelectric sources.&lt;ref name=norway/&gt;

A hydro-electric station rarely operates at its full power rating over a full year; the ratio between annual average power and installed capacity rating is the [[capacity factor]]. The installed capacity is the sum of all generator nameplate power ratings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2009/STAGING/local_assets/downloads/spreadsheets/statistical_review_full_report_workbook_2009.xls Consumption BP.com]{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2699">In [[geometry]], any [[hyperplane]] ''H'' of a [[projective space]] ''P'' may be taken as a '''hyperplane at infinity'''. Then the [[set complement]] {{nowrap|''P'' ∖ ''H''}} is called an [[affine space]]. For instance, if {{nowrap|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} are [[homogeneous coordinates]] for ''n''-dimensional projective space, then the equation {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}} defines a hyperplane at infinity for the ''n''-dimensional affine space with coordinates {{nowrap|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. ''H'' is also called the '''ideal hyperplane'''.

Similarly, starting from an affine space ''A'', every class of [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines can be associated with a [[point at infinity]]. The [[union (set theory)|union]] over all classes of parallels constitute the points of the hyperplane at infinity. Adjoining the points of this hyperplane (called '''ideal points''') to ''A'' converts it into an ''n''-dimensional projective space, such as the real projective space {{nowrap|'''R'''P&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

By adding these ideal points, the entire affine space ''A'' is completed to a projective space ''P'', which may be called the '''projective completion''' of ''A''.  Each [[affine subspace]] ''S'' of ''A'' is completed to a [[projective space|projective subspace]] of ''P'' by adding to ''S'' all the ideal points corresponding to the directions of the lines contained in ''S''.  The resulting projective subspaces are often called ''affine subspaces'' of the projective space ''P'', as opposed to the '''infinite''' or '''ideal''' subspaces, which are the subspaces of the hyperplane at infinity (however, they are projective spaces, not affine spaces).

In the projective space, each projective subspace of dimension ''k'' intersects the ideal hyperplane in a projective subspace "at infinity" whose dimension is {{nowrap|''k'' − 1}}.

A pair of non-[[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] affine hyperplanes intersect at an affine subspace of dimension {{nowrap|''n'' − 2}}, but a parallel pair of affine hyperplanes intersect at a projective subspace of the ideal hyperplane (the intersection ''lies on'' the ideal hyperplane). Thus, parallel hyperplanes, which did not meet in the affine space, intersect in the projective completion due to the addition of the hyperplane at infinity.

== Data ==
In recent years, there has been a surge in large data sets available on human movements. These data sets are usually obtained from [[cell phone tracking|cell phone]] or [[GPS tracking|GPS]] data, with varying degrees of accuracy. For example, cell phone data is usually recorded whenever a call or a text message has been made or received by the user, and contains the location of the tower that the phone has connected to as well as the time stamp.&lt;ref name=marta /&gt; In urban areas, user and the telecommunication tower might be only a few hundred meters away from each other, while in rural areas this distance might well be in region of a few kilometers. Therefore, there is varying degree of accuracy when it comes to locating a person using cell phone data. These datasets are anonymized by the phone companies so as to hide and protect the identity of actual users. As example of its usage, researchers &lt;ref name=marta /&gt; used the trajectory of 100,000 cell phone users within a period of six months, while in much larger scale &lt;ref name=song /&gt; trajectories of three million cell phone users were analyzed.
GPS data are usually much more accurate even though they usually are, because of [[privacy]] concerns, much harder to acquire. Massive amounts of GPS data describing human mobility are produced, for example, by on-board GPS devices on private vehicles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150908/ncomms9166/full/ncomms9166.html|title = Returners and Explorers dichotomy in Human Mobility|last = Luca Pappalardo|date = 8 September 2015|journal = Nature Communications|doi = 10.1038/ncomms9166|pmid = 26349016|volume = 6|display-authors=etal|pages=8166|pmc=4569739|bibcode=2015NatCo...6E8166P}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GPS device automatically turns on when the vehicle starts, and the sequence of GPS points the device produces every few seconds forms a detailed mobility trajectory of the vehicle. Some recent scientific studies compared the mobility patterns emerged from mobile phone data with those emerged from GPS data.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Pappalardo et al., [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6855925&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6855925 Comparing general mobility and mobility by car], BRICS Countries Congress (BRICS-CCI) and 11th Brazilian Congress (CBIC) on Computational Intelligence, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have been able to extract very detailed information about the people whose data are made available to public. This has sparked a great amount of concern about privacy issues. As an example of liabilities that might happen, [[New York City]] released 173 million individual [[taxi]] trips. City officials used a very weak [[cryptography algorithm]] to anonymize the license number and medallion number, which is an alphanumeric code assigned to each taxi cab.&lt;ref name=gawker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/the-public-nyc-taxicab-database-that-accidentally-track-1646724546 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141118175119/http://gawker.com/the-public-nyc-taxicab-database-that-accidentally-track-1646724546 |archivedate=2014-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This made it possible for hackers to completely de-anonymize the dataset, and even some were able to extract detailed information about specific passengers and celebrities, including their origin and destination and how much they tipped.&lt;ref name=gawker /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/27/new-york-taxi-details-anonymised-data-researchers-warn&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
At the large scale, when the behaviour is modelled over a period of relatively long duration (e.g. more than one day), human mobility can be described by three major components:
* trip distance distribution &lt;math&gt; P(r) &lt;/math&gt;
* radius of [[gyration]]  &lt;math&gt; r_g (t)&lt;/math&gt;
* number of visited locations &lt;math&gt; S(t) &lt;/math&gt;

Brockmann,&lt;ref&gt;The scaling laws of human travel. D Brockmann, L Hufnagel, T Geisel - Nature, 2006 - nature.com&lt;/ref&gt; by analysing banknotes, found that the probability of travel distance follows a [[scale-free network|scale-free]] [[random walk]] known as [[Lévy flight]] of form &lt;math&gt; P(r)\ \sim r^{-(1+\beta)} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\beta =0.6 &lt;/math&gt;. This was later confirmed by two studies that used cell phone data&lt;ref name=marta /&gt; and GPS data to track users.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140%2Fepjst%2Fe2013-01715-5|title = Understanding the patterns of car travel|last = Luca Pappalardo|date = 29 January 2013|journal = European Physical Journal ST|doi = 10.1140/epjst/e2013-01715-5|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 215|issue = 1|display-authors=etal|pages=61–73|bibcode = 2013EPJST.215...61P}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implication of this model is that, as opposed to other more traditional forms of random walks such as [[brownian motion]], human trips tend to be of mostly short distances with a few long distance ones. In brownian motion, the distribution of trip distances are govern by a bell-shaped curve, which means that the next trip is of a roughly predictable size, the average, where in Lévy flight it might be an order of magnitude larger than the average.

Some people are inherently inclined to travel longer distances than the average, and the same is true for people with lesser urge for movement. Radius of gyration is used to capture just that and it indicates the characteristic distance travelled by a person during a time period t.&lt;ref name=marta&gt;Understanding individual human mobility patterns
MC Gonzalez, CA Hidalgo, AL Barabasi - Nature, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Each user, within his radius of gyration &lt;math&gt; r_g (t)&lt;/math&gt;, will choose his trip distance according to &lt;math&gt; P(r) &lt;/math&gt;.

The third component models the fact that humans tend to visit some locations more often than what would have happened under a random scenario. For example, home or workplace or favorite restaurants are visited much more than many other places in a user's radius of gyration. It has been discovered that &lt;math&gt; S(t)\ \sim t^{\mu} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \mu = 0.6 &lt;/math&gt;, which indicates a sublinear growth in different number of places visited by an individual .
These three measures capture the fact that most trips happen between a limited number of places, with less frequent travels to places outside of an individual's radius of gyration.

== Predictability ==
Although the human mobility is modeled as a random process, it is surprisingly predictable. By measuring the entropy of each person's movement, it has been shown &lt;ref name=song&gt;Limits of predictability in human mobility. C Song, Z Qu, N Blumm, AL Barabási - Science, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; that there is a 93% potential predictability. This means that although there is a great variance in type of users and the distances that each of them travel, the overall characteristic of them is highly predictable. Implication of it is that in principle, it is possible to accurately model the processes that are dependent on human mobility patterns, such as disease or mobile virus spreading patterns.&lt;ref name=airtransportation&gt;A metric of influential spreading during contagion dynamics through the air transportation network
C Nicolaides, L Cueto-Felgueroso, MC González… - PLoS ONE, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=phonevirus&gt;Understanding the spreading patterns of mobile phone viruses

On individual scale, daily human mobility can be explained by only 17 [[Network motif]]s. Each individual, shows one of these motifs characteristically, over a period of several months. This opens up the possibility to reproduce daily individual mobility using a tractable analytical model&lt;ref&gt;Unravelling daily human mobility motifs
CM Schneider, V Belik, T Couronné, Z Smoreda… - Journal of The Royal Society Interface, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
[[Infectious disease]]s spread across the globe usually because of long-distance travels of carriers of the disease. These long-distance travels are made using [[air transport]]ation systems and it has been shown that "[[network topology]], traffic structure, and individual mobility patterns are all essential for accurate predictions of disease spreading".&lt;ref name=airtransportation/&gt; On a smaller spatial scale the regularity of human movement patterns and its temporal structure should be taken into account in models of infectious disease spread.&lt;ref name=commuting&gt;V Belik, T Geisel, D Brockmann, Natural human mobility patterns and spatial spread of infectious diseases. Phys. Rev. X, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Cellphone viruses that are transmitted via bluetooth are greatly dependent on the human interaction and movements. With more people using similar operating systems for their cellphones, it's becoming much easier to have a virus epidemic.&lt;ref name=phonevirus /&gt;

In [[Transportation Planning]], leveraging the characteristics of human movement, such as tendency to travel short distances with few but regular bursts of long-distance trips, novel improvements have been made to [[Trip distribution]] models, specifically to [[Gravity model of migration]] &lt;ref&gt;A universal model for mobility and migration patterns
F Simini, MC González, A Maritan, AL Barabási - Nature, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Interactive art''' is a form of [[art]] that involves the spectator in a way that allows the art to achieve its purpose. Some interactive art installations achieve this by letting the observer or visitor "walk" in, on, and around them; some others ask the artist or the spectators to become part of the artwork.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soler-Adillon|first=Joan|date=2015-12-21|title=The intangible material of interactive art: agency, behavior and emergence|url=http://journals.uoc.edu/index.php/artnodes/article/view/n16-soler|journal=Artnodes|language=en|volume=0|issue=16|doi=10.7238/a.v0i16.2744|issn=1695-5951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Works of this kind of art frequently feature [[computer]]s, interfaces and sometimes sensors to respond to motion, heat, meteorological changes or other types of input their makers programmed them to respond to. Most examples of virtual [[Internet art]] and [[electronic art]] are highly interactive. Sometimes, visitors are able to navigate through a [[hypertext]] environment; some works accept textual or visual input from outside; sometimes an audience can influence the course of a [[performance art|performance]] or can even participate in it. Some other interactive artworks are considered as immersive as the quality of interaction involve all the spectrum of surrounding stimuli. Virtual reality environments like works by [[Maurice Benayoun]] and [[Jeffrey Shaw]] are highly interactive as the work the spectators – Maurice Benayoun call them "visitors", Miroslaw Rogala calls them (v)users,  [[Char Davies]] "immersants" –  interact with take all their fields of perception.

Though some of the earliest examples of interactive art have been dated back to the 1920s, most digital art didn’t make its official entry into the world of art until the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="Paul, C page 67"&gt;Paul, C: ''Digital Art'', page 67. Thames &amp; Hudson Inc, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since this debut, countless museums and venues have been increasingly accommodating digital and interactive art into their productions.  This budding genre of art is continuing to grow and evolve in a somewhat rapid manner through internet social sub-culture, as well as through large scale urban installations.

== Interactivity in art ==
[[File:Boundaryfunctions 1.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|alt=Boundary Functions at the Tokyo Intercommunications Center, 1999.|''Boundary Functions'' (1998) interactive floor projection by [[Scott Snibbe]] at the [[NTT InterCommunication Center]] in Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://snibbe.com/projects/interactive/boundaryfunctions "Boundary Functions"]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Interactive art is a genre of art in which the viewers participate in some way by providing an input in order to determine the outcome.  Unlike traditional art forms wherein the interaction of the spectator is merely a mental event, interactivity allows for various types of navigation, assembly, and/or contribution to an artwork, which goes far beyond purely psychological activity.&lt;ref name="Paul, C page 67"/&gt;  Interactivity as a medium produces meaning.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Muller, L, Edmonds, E, Connel, M: "Living laboratories for interactive art", ''CoDesign'', 2(4):3&lt;/ref&gt;

Interactive art installations are generally computer-based and frequently rely on sensors, which gauge things such as temperature, motion, proximity, and other meteorological phenomena that the maker has programmed in order to elicit responses based on participant action.  In interactive artworks, both the audience and the machine work together in dialogue in order to produce a completely unique artwork for each audience to observe. However, not all observers visualize the same picture. Because it is interactive art, each observer makes their own interpretation of the artwork and it may be completely different than another observer's views.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Interactive art can be distinguished from [[Generative art]] in that it constitutes a dialogue between the artwork and the participant; specifically, the participant has agency, or the ability, even in an unintentional manner, to act upon the artwork and is furthermore invited to do so within the context of the piece, i.e. the work affords the interaction. More often, we can consider that the work takes its visitor into account. In an increasing number of cases an installation can be defined as a [[responsive environment]], especially those created by architects and designers. By contrast, Generative Art, which may be interactive, but not responsive per se, tends to be a monologue – the artwork may change or evolve in the presence of the viewer, but the viewer may not be invited to engage in the reaction but merely enjoy it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
According to the new media artist and theorist {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} [[Maurice Benayoun]], the first piece of interactive art should be the work done by [[Parrhasius (painter)|Parrhasius]] during his art contest with [[Zeuxis]] described by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], in the fifth century B.C. when Zeuxis tried to unveil the painted curtain. The work takes its meaning from Zeuxis' gesture and wouldn’t exist without it. Zeuxis, by its gesture, became part of Parrhasius' work. This shows that the specificity of interactive art resides often less in the use of computers than in the quality of proposed "situations" and the "Other's" involvement in the process of [[sensemaking]]. Nevertheless, computers and real time computing made the task easier and opened the field of virtuality – the potential emergence of unexpected (although possibly pre-written) futures – to contemporary arts.

Some of the earliest examples of interactive art were created as early as the 1920s.  An example is [[Marcel Duchamp]]’s piece named ''Rotary Glass Plates''.  The artwork required the viewer to turn on the machine and stand at a distance of one meter in order to see an optical illusion.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, C: ''Digital Art'', page 11. Thames &amp; Hudson Inc, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The present idea of interactive art began to flourish more in the 1960s for partly political reasons.  At the time, many people found it inappropriate for artists to carry the only creative power within their works.  Those artists who held this view wanted to give the audience their own part of this creative process.  An early example is found in the early 1960s "change-paintings" of [[Roy Ascott]], about whom [[Frank Popper]] has written: "Ascott was among the first artists to launch an appeal for total spectator participation".&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Frank (2007). From Technological to Virtual Art. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. p. 77. {{ISBN|978-0-262-16230-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aside from the “political” view, it was also current wisdom that interaction and engagement had a positive part to play within the creative process.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, E, Muller, L, Connel, M: "On creative engagement", ''Visual Communication'', 5(307):3&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s artists began to use new technology such as video and satellites to experiment with live performances and interactions through the direct broadcast of video and audio.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, C: ''Digital Art'', page 18. Thames &amp; Hudson Inc, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interactive art became a large phenomenon due to the advent of computer based interactivity in the 1990s. Along with this came a new kind of art-experience.  Audience and machine were now able to more easily work together in dialogue in order to produce a unique artwork for each audience.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  In the late 1990s, museums and galleries began increasingly incorporating the art form in their shows, some even dedicating entire exhibitions to it.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, C: ''Digital Art'', page 23. Thames &amp; Hudson Inc, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  This continues today and is only expanding due to increased communications through digital media.

A hybrid emerging discipline drawing on the combined interests of specific artists and architects has been created in the last 10–15 years. Disciplinary boundaries have blurred, and significant number of architects and interactive designers have joined electronic artists in the creation of new, custom-designed interfaces and evolutions in techniques for obtaining user input (such as dog vision, alternative sensors, voice analysis, etc.); forms and tools for information display (such as video projection, lasers, robotic and mechatronic actuators, led lighting etc.); modes for human-human and human-machine communication (through the Internet and other telecommunications networks); and to the development of social contexts for interactive systems (such as utilitarian tools, formal experiments, games and entertainment, social critique, and political liberation).

== Forms ==
There are many different forms of interactive art.  Such forms range from interactive dance, music, and even drama.&lt;ref&gt;Dannenberg, R, Bates, J: "[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rbd/papers/interactiveart.pdf A model for interactive art]", ''Proceedings of the Fifth Biennial Symposium for Arts and Technology'', 51(78):2&lt;/ref&gt;  New technology, primarily computer systems and computer technology, have enabled a new class of interactive art.&lt;ref&gt;Dannenberg, R, Bates, J: "A model for interactive art", ''Proceedings of the Fifth Biennial Symposium for Arts and Technology'', 51(78):1&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of such interactive art are [[installation art]], [[interactive architecture]], [[interactive film]], and [[interactive storytelling]].

== Impact ==
The aesthetic impact of interactive art is more profound than expected.

Supporters of more “traditional” contemporary art saw, in the use of computers, a way to balance artistic deficiencies, some other consider that the art is not anymore in the achievement of the formal shape of the work but in the design of the rules that determine the evolution of the shape according to the quality of the dialogue.

== Events and places ==
There are number of globally significant festivals and exhibitions of interactive and media arts. [[Prix Ars Electronica]] is a major yearly competition and exhibition that gives awards to outstanding examples of (technology-driven) interactive art.  [[SIGGRAPH|Association of Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group in Graphics (SIGGRAPH)]], DEAF Dutch Electronic Arts Festival, Transmediale Germany, [[Electronic Language International Festival|FILE - Electronic Language International Festival]] Brazil, and AV Festival England, are among the others.

CAiiA, Centre for Advanced Inquiry in the Interactive Arts, first established by [[Roy Ascott]] in 1994 at the [[University of Wales, Newport]], and later in 2003 as the [[Planetary Collegium]], was the first doctoral and post doc research center to be established specifically for research in the interactive art field.

[[Interactive architecture]] has now been installed on and as part of building facades, in foyers, museums and large scale public spaces, including airports, in a number of global cities. A number of  leading museums, for example, the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]], [[Tate]], [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] and [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in [[London]] (to cite the leading UK museums active in this field) were early adoptors in the field of interactive technologies, investing in educational resources, and more latterly, in the creative use of MP3 players for visitors. In 2004 the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum commissioned curator and author Lucy Bullivant to write Responsive Environments (2006), the first such publication of its kind. Interactive designers are frequently commissioned for museum displays; a number specialize in wearable computing.

==Tools==

A '''philosophical interpretation''' is the assignment of meanings to various concepts, symbols, or [[wikt:object|objects]] under consideration. Two broad types of interpretation can be distinguished: interpretations of physical objects, and interpretations of concepts ([[Conceptual model]]).

== Conceptual interpretations ==

=== Aesthetic interpretation ===
{{Main|Aesthetic interpretation}}

Interpretation is related to perceiving the things. An [[aesthetic]] interpretation is an explanation of the [[meaning (non-linguistic)|meaning]] of some work of art. An aesthetic interpretation expresses an understanding of a work of art, a poem, performance, or piece of literature. There may be different interpretations to same work by art by different people owing to their different perceptions or aims. All such interpretations are termed as 'aesthetic interpretations'. Some people, instead of interpreting work of art, believe in interpreting artist himself. It pretty much means "how or what do I believe about (subject)"&lt;ref&gt;http://classof1.com/homework_answers/philosophy/aesthetics_interpretation/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judicial interpretation ===
{{Main|Judicial interpretation|Textualism|Strict constructionism|5=Originalism|6=Prudentialism }}

A judicial interpretation is a conceptual interpretation that explains how the judiciary should interpret the law, particularly [[constitution]]al documents and [[legislation]] (see [[statutory interpretation]]).

=== Logical interpretation ===
{{Main|Logical interpretation}}

In [[logic]], an interpretation is an assignment of meaning to the [[Symbol (formal)|symbols]] of a language. The [[formal languages]] used in mathematics, logic, and theoretical computer science are defined in solely syntactic terms, and as such do not have any meaning until they are given some interpretation. The general study of interpretations of formal languages is called ''formal semantics''.

=== Religious interpretation ===
{{Main|Religious interpretation}}

Religious interpretation and similarly religious self-interpretation define a section of religion-related studies (theology, comparative religion, reason) where attention is given to aspects of perception—where religious symbolism and the self-image of all those who hold religious views have important bearing on how others perceive their particular belief system and its adherents.

== Scientific interpretation ==
{{Main|Scientific theory}}

=== Descriptive interpretation ===
{{Main|Descriptive interpretation}}

An interpretation is a ''descriptive interpretation'' (also called a ''factual interpretation'') if at least one of the undefined symbols of its formal system becomes, in the interpretation, the name of a physical object, or observable property. A descriptive interpretation is a type of interpretation used in science and logic to talk about empirical entities.

=== Scientific model ===
{{Main|Scientific modeling}}

When scientists attempt to formalize the principles of the empirical sciences, they use an interpretation to [[Scientific model|model reality]], in the same way logicians axiomatize the principles of logic. The aim of these attempts is to construct a formal system that will serve as a conceptual model of reality. Predictions or other statements drawn from such a formal system mirror or map the real world only insofar as these scientific models are true.

'''Ishvaratva''' in [[Sanskrit]] language is an [[Noun|abstract noun]] meaning '[[Divinity|godhood]]',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Grammar of the Hindi Language|author=Samuel Henry Kellogg|page=54|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4rUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=Ishvaratva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s1-2UoHlH6ikyAOl7YD4Ag&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Ishvaratva&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; it also means [[divinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Blade: Life &amp; work of Brahmabandhab Upadhyay|author=Brahmachari Rewachand Animananda|publisher=Roy &amp; Son|page=ix|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywkaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Ishvaratva&amp;dq=Ishvaratva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s1-2UoHlH6ikyAOl7YD4Ag&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Purushottama]] (the Lord) conceals and also manifests the qualities at His will, He conceals his qualities like ''[[Ānanda (Hindu philosophy)|Ananda]]'' ('bliss') and ''Ishvaratva'' ('Lordship') in the ''[[Jiva]]s'' ('Individual Souls') and also conceals His quality of Consciousness in this material world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Schools of Indian Philosophical Thought|author=Prajanananda|publisher=Firma K. l. Mukhopadhyay 1973|page=253|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_hsgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Ishvaratva&amp;dq=Ishvaratva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s1-2UoHlH6ikyAOl7YD4Ag&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Chidabhasa]]'' which constitutes ''Ishvaratva'' is almost an exact likeness of true consciousness on account of its being associated with ''[[Prakrti]]'' in equilibrium and consequently unperturbed by the ''[[gunas]]'' in action. He is ''[[Saguna Brahman]]'' whilst true consciousness is ''[[Nirguna Brahman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Isha Upanishat|author=Kaulacharya Satyananda|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vrxDAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Ishvaratva&amp;dq=Ishvaratva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s1-2UoHlH6ikyAOl7YD4Ag&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ishvaratva'' is only from the standpoint of ''Jivatva''. Both, ''Ishvaratva'' and ''[[Jivatva]]'', are the apparent modifications of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] or [[Brahman]]. Though of mutually opposed qualities they are denoted by word ''tvam'', the ''Atman'' as qualified by the mental states such as 'waking', 'dream' and 'dreamless sleep''. The Mahavakya, [[Tat Tvam Asi]] affirms the identity between [[Brahman]], [[Jiva]] and [[Ishvara]]  ([[Vivekachudamani]] 243-244).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani|author=Sri Candrasekhar Bharti of Sringeri|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|pages=256–257|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sri-Samkaras-VIVEKACUDAMANI-Chandrasekharendra-Bharati/dp/8172764200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-luminosity means being directly cognizable without dependence on anything else; and being different from that is ''hetu'' ('proximal or concomitant cause'). The assumed difference between Brahman that is cognized and the Brahman that cognizes is imaginary (''kalpanika'') because in reality there is no difference. The assumed difference between Brahman on the one hand and ''Jiva'' and ''Ishvara'' on the other is not based on luminosity but on other ''dharmas'' (''jivatva'' and ''ishvaratva'') (Advaita-siddhi 22-23).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Advaita-siddhi|author=Madhusudana Saraswati|url=http://sanskritdocuments.org/sites/snsastri/Advaitasiddhi-dRishyatvam.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ishvaratva'' is due to the ''[[Upadhi]]'' of ''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|Avidya]]''. By the ''Upadhis'' that are ''avidyatmaka'', ''attatvika'' and ''kalpanika'' by creating divisions in the divisionless and partless Brahman when in reality no divisions whatsoever exist. [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] in his [[Bhashya]] on [[Brahma Sutras|Brahma Sutra]] 2.1.14 explains that name and form constitute the seeds of the entire expanse of phenomenal existence, and which are conjured up by nescience. The omniscient God i.e. Brahman, who diversifies the seed ([[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] VI.12), who manifests names and forms ([[Chandogya Upanishad]] VI.iii.2) and creates all forms, gives them names (and entering into them) (Taittirya Aranyaka III.xii.7), is different from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya|author=Sankaracarya|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=326–335|url= https://advaitaashrama.org/Book/Detail/8121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sage of the [[Mandukya Upanishad]] partitioning the symbol [[Om|Aum]] in three different morae adds a fourth mora-less part corresponding to which there are three different states of consciousness, corresponding to which, again, are different kinds of soul and posits  "the four states of consciousness – wakefulness, the dream, sleep and a fourth name-less state of consciousness (turiya) while teaching that there is an aspect of the Godhead corresponding to these states of consciousness, the last alone being ultimately real. The Absolute of philosophy surpasses even such a theological conception as that of God." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|page=23|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is only to those who regard the Universal Being as immanent in their own Selves, to them belongs eternal happiness, to no one else ([[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] VI.12).

'''John Armleder''' (born 1948, in [[Geneva]]) is a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] performance artist, painter, sculptor, critic, and curator. His work is based on his involvement with [[Fluxus]] in the 1960s and 1970s, when he created [[performance art]] pieces, installations and collective art activities that were strongly influenced by [[John Cage]]. However, Armleder's position throughout his career has been to avoid associating his artistic practice with any type of manifesto.

==Early life and education==
Armleder was born as the son of a hotelier (owners of [[Le Richemond]]). He studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Geneva (1966-7) and at the Glamorgan Summer School, Britain (1969).

==Work==
In 1969, with Patrick Lucchini and Claude Rychner, Armleder founded the ''Groupe Ecart'' in Geneva, from which stemmed the Galerie Ecart and its associated performance group and publications. The ''Groupe Ecart'' was particularly important in [[Europe]] during the 1970s and 1980s, not only through its activity as an independent publishing house, but also because it introduced in [[Switzerland]]—and sometimes in Europe—a large number of notable artists, including [[Joseph Beuys]] and [[Andy Warhol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Bovier, Lionel; Cherix, Christophe; ''L’Irrésolution commune d’un engagement équivoque''; Genève : Mamco : Cabinet des estampes, 1997; {{OCLC|40323917}} (for further reading on Ecart and the early period of John Armleder's work)&lt;/ref&gt; Armleder was later associated with ''Neo-Geo'' artistic movement and was often referred to as the "darling" of the New York art critics in this period (1980s).&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Bovier, Lionel; ''John Armleder''; Paris : Flammarion, 2005. {{OCLC|62363982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{En icon}} Bovier, Lionel; Radzinowicz, David; ''John Armleder''; Paris : Flammarion ; New York : Rizzoli International Publications, 2005. {{OCLC|67711312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armleder frequently examines the context in which art is displayed and views the exhibition as a medium in its own right. Since the 1990s, he has created installations, paintings, wall paintings, sculptures and what he calls ''Furniture Sculptures''—installations that usually juxtapose furniture with monochrome or abstract paintings, either literally on the furniture or on a canvas hanging nearby. His work has varied greatly in form, and has, since the beginning, used [[Randomness|chance]] as a method of producing the final forms that pieces take, much like [[John Cage]]. He often uses a dense scenographic hanging style, putting individual works into close proximity and creating installation-like exhibitions.

==Exhibitions==
In 2004, a retrospective exhibition of his works on paper was shown at the [[Kunsthalle Zürich]], Switzerland, and later traveled to the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia|ICA]] in Philadelphia. In the winter of 2006-2007, a large exhibition including works from all eras of his career was shown at the [[MAMCO|Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (Mamco)]] in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. In April 2013, the [[Dairy Art Centre]] in [[London]] opened its doors with a large solo show paying tribute to Armleder's oeuvre.

The term has been used at least since the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DHwXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA35&amp;dq=%22kick+the+cat%22+business&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NrV1VNC5BbOUsQS7yYKQCg&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kick%20the%20cat%22%20business&amp;f=false|title=Journal of Proceedings of the ... Annual Convention of Young Men's Christian Associations of the United States and British Provinces, Volume 14|p=35|year=1869}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author John Bradshaw, humans were far more cruel to cats at that time, to the extent that kicking one was not perceived to be unusual and hence entered the language as a popular idiom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cat Sense: How the New Feline Science Can Make You a Better Friend to Your Pet|first=John|last=Bradshaw|p=194|publisher=Basic Books|year=2013|isbn=978-0-465-04095-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept was reinforced in British culture by a scene in the ''[[Blackadder]]'' episode ''[[Nob and Nobility]]'' in which Edmund Blackadder kicks the cat when annoyed, and the cat bites the mouse, and the mouse bites Baldrick.

In current usage, the name envisions a scenario where an angry or frustrated employee comes home from work looking for some way to take out his anger, but the only thing present is the cat. He physically abuses it as a means of relieving his frustration, despite the cat playing no part in causing it.&lt;ref name="glass"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWy2GlYGDx0C&amp;pg=PT80&amp;lpg=PT80&amp;dq=kick+the+cat+syndrome&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2EgZkGoIvF&amp;sig=U8Gf-TrF4cZLZII107iJg0nv8-o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cLJ1VMNKhsaxBIaggtgP&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=kick%20the%20cat%20syndrome&amp;f=false|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Verbal Self Defense|first=Lillian|last=Glass|p=80|publisher=Penguin|year=1999|isbn=978-1-440-65074-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workplace or family dynamics==
Kicking the cat is commonly used to describe the behaviour of staff abusing coworkers or subordinates as a mechanism to relieve [[Occupational stress|stress]].&lt;ref name="quinn"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/jul/23/careers.theguardian5|title=With colleagues like these|first=Catherine|last=Quinn|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=23 July 2007|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behaviour can result in a [[chain reaction]], where a higher-ranking member of the company abuses his or her subordinate, who takes it out on his or her own subordinate, and so on down the line. This [[domino effect]] can also be seen in family dynamics, where the father yells at the mother who yells at the older child who yells at the younger child who yells at the pet.&lt;ref&gt;Cooney, Beth, [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1999-05-02/features/9904290688_1_chain-reaction-nuclear-families-emotions Grumpy Ol' Dad], Sun-Sentinel, May 2, 1999. Retrieved 5 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blaming]] others can lead to kicking the dog where individuals in a [[hierarchy]] blame their immediate subordinate, and this propagates down a hierarchy until the lowest rung (the "dog"). A 2009 experimental study has shown that blaming can be contagious even for uninvolved onlookers.&lt;ref&gt;Jeanna Bryner: [http://livescience.com/culture/blame-contagious-100119.html Workplace Blame Is Contagious and Detrimental], [[LiveScience]], 2010-01-19, citing the January 2010 issue of the ''[[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]]''.'.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological theories==
According to ''Psychology Today'', "Anger and frustration in one part of life can lead us to lash out at innocent people (or pets) in another."&lt;ref name=pt/&gt; The technical term for this kind of behaviour is "displaced aggression".&lt;ref name=pt/&gt;

Kicking the cat is looked upon unfavourably and viewed as a sign of  poor [[anger management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nLm2C_J9A90C&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=%22kick+the+cat%22+business&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NrV1VNC5BbOUsQS7yYKQCg&amp;ved=0CFsQuwUwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kick%20the%20cat%22%20business&amp;f=false|title=Understanding and Training Your Cat or Kitten|first=H.

A '''[[kinematics|kinematic]] diagram''' or '''kinematic scheme''' illustrates the connectivity of links and joints of a [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]] or [[machine]] rather than the dimensions or shape of the parts.  Often links are presented as geometric objects, such as lines, triangles or squares, that support schematic versions of the joints of the mechanism or machine.&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Uicker, G. R. Pennock, and J. E. Shigley, 2003, '''Theory of Machines and Mechanisms,''' Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; A kinematic diagram is sometimes called a '''joint map''' or a '''skeleton diagram'''.

For example, the figures show the kinematic diagrams (i) of the slider-crank that forms a piston and crank-shaft in an engine, and (ii) of the first three joints for a PUMA manipulator.

==Linkage graph==
A [[kinematics|kinematic]] diagram can be formulated as a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] by representing the links of the mechanism as vertices and the joints as edges of the graph.  This version of the kinematic diagram has proven effective in enumerating kinematic structures in the process of machine design.&lt;ref&gt;Lung-Wen Tsai, 2001, [https://books.google.com/books?id=X0AHKxwWTsYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  Mechanism design: enumeration of kinematic structures according to function], CRC Press&lt;/ref&gt;

An important consideration in this design process is the [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degree of freedom]] of the system of links and joints, which is determined using the [[Chebychev–Grübler–Kutzbach criterion]].

==Elements of machines==
Elements of [[kinematic]]s diagrams include the frame, which is the frame of reference for all the moving components, as well as links ([[kinematic pair]]s), and joints.  [[Primary Joints]] include pins, sliders and other elements that allow pure rotation or pure linear motion.  [[Higher order joints]] also exist that allow a combination of rotation or linear motion.  Kinematic diagrams also include points of interest, and other important components.

This is a '''list of writing systems''' (or '''scripts'''), classified according to some common distinguishing features. There are at least 3,866 languages that make use of an established writing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/enterprise-faq/how-many-languages-world-are-unwritten-0|title=How many languages in the world are unwritten?|date=9 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usual name of the script is given first; the name of the language(s) in which the script is written follows (in brackets), particularly in the case where the language name differs from the script name. Other informative or qualifying annotations for the script may also be provided.

==Pictographic/ideographic writing systems==
{{Writing systems sidebar}}
Ideographic scripts (in which graphemes are [[ideogram]]s representing concepts or ideas, rather than a specific word in a language), and pictographic scripts (in which the graphemes are iconic pictures) are not thought to be able to express all that can be communicated by language, as argued by the linguists [[John DeFrancis]] and [[J. Marshall Unger]].  Essentially, they postulate that no ''full'' writing system can be completely pictographic or ideographic; it must be able to refer directly to a language in order to have the full expressive capacity of a language.  Unger disputes claims made on behalf of [[Blissymbols]] in his 2004 book ''Ideogram''.

Although a few [[pictographic script|pictographic]] or [[ideographic script]]s exist today, there is no single way to read them, because there is no one-to-one correspondence between symbol and language.  Hieroglyphs were commonly thought to be ideographic before they were translated, and to this day Chinese is often erroneously said to be ideographic.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K., ''Spoken and written language,'' Deakin University Press, 1985, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases of ideographic scripts, only the author of a text can read it with any certainty, and it may be said that they are ''interpreted'' rather than read.  Such scripts often work best as mnemonic aids for oral texts, or as outlines that will be fleshed out in speech.

*[[Testerian]] – used for missionary work in Mexico
*Other [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] with the exception of [[Maya script|Maya Hieroglyphs]].

There are also symbol systems used to represent things other than language, or to represent constructed languages. Some of these are
*[[Blissymbols]] – A constructed ideographic script used primarily in [[Augmentative and Alternative Communication]] (AAC).
*[[iConji]] – A constructed ideographic script used primarily in social networking
*[[Emoji]] - Used to communicate feelings and thoughts on the [[world wide web]]
*[[Isotype (picture language)]]
*[[Sona language (artificial)|Sona]]
* A wide variety of [[Writing system|notation]]s

[[Linear B]] and [[Asemic writing]] also incorporate ideograms.

== Logographic writing systems ==
In logographic writing systems, glyphs represent [[Word (linguistics)|word]]s or [[morpheme]]s (meaningful components of words, as in ''mean-ing-ful''), rather than phonetic elements.

Note that no logographic script is composed solely of [[logogram]]s. All contain graphemes that represent [[phonetic]] (sound-based) elements as well. These phonetic elements may be used on their own (to represent, for example, grammatical inflections or foreign words), or may serve as [[phonetic complement]]s to a logogram (used to specify the sound of a logogram that might otherwise represent more than one word). In the case of Chinese, the phonetic element is built into the logogram itself; in Egyptian and Mayan, many glyphs are purely phonetic, whereas others function as either logograms or phonetic elements, depending on context. For this reason, many such scripts may be more properly referred to as logosyllabic or complex scripts; the terminology used is largely a product of custom in the field, and is to an extent arbitrary.

== Syllabaries ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Syllabary]] --&gt;
In a [[syllabary]], graphemes represent [[syllable]]s or [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]]s. (Note that the 19th-century term ''syllabics'' usually referred to ''[[abugida]]s'' rather than true syllabaries.)

===[[Semi-syllabaries]]: Partly syllabic, partly alphabetic scripts===
In most of these systems, some consonant-vowel combinations are written as syllables, but others are written as consonant plus vowel. In the case of Old Persian, all vowels were written regardless, so it was ''effectively'' a true alphabet despite its syllabic component. In Japanese a similar system plays a minor role in foreign borrowings; for example, [tu] is written [to]+[u], and [ti] as [te]+[i]. Paleohispanic [[semi-syllabaries]] behaved as a [[syllabary]] for the [[stop consonant]]s and as an [[alphabet]] for the rest of consonants and vowels. The Tartessian or Southwestern script is typologically intermediate between a pure alphabet and the Paleohispanic full semi-syllabaries. Although the letter used to write a stop consonant was determined by the following vowel, as in a full [[semi-syllabary]], the following vowel was also written, as in an alphabet. Some scholars treat Tartessian as a redundant semi-syllabary, others treat it as a redundant alphabet. Zhuyin is semi-syllabic in a different sense: it transcribes half syllables. That is, it has letters for [[syllable onset]]s and [[syllable rime|rimes]] ''(kan = "k-an")'' rather than for consonants and vowels ''(kan = "k-a-n").''

== Segmental scripts ==
A [[segmental script]] has [[grapheme]]s which represent the [[phoneme]]s (basic unit of sound) of a language.

Note that there need not be (and rarely is) a one-to-one correspondence between the graphemes of the script and the phonemes of a language. A phoneme may be represented only by some combination or string of graphemes, the same phoneme may be represented by more than one distinct grapheme, the same grapheme may stand for more than one phoneme, or some combination of all of the above.

Segmental scripts may be further divided according to the types of phonemes they typically record:

=== Abjads ===
An [[abjad]] is a segmental script containing symbols for [[consonant]]s only, or where vowels are ''optionally'' written with [[diacritics]] ("pointing") or only written word-initially.

=== True alphabets ===
A true [[alphabet]] contains separate letters (not [[diacritic]] marks) for both [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s.

[[File:Alphabets in Europe.svg|thumb|right|300px|Writing systems used in countries of Europe.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This maps shows languages official in the respective countries; if a country has an independent breakaway republic, both languages are shown. Moldova's sole official language is Romanian (Latin-based), but the unrecognized de facto independent republic of Transnistria uses three Cyrillic-based languages: Ukrainian, Russian, and Moldovan. Georgia's official languages are Georgian and Abkhazian (in Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia), the sparsely recognized de facto independent republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia use Cyrillic-based languages: Both republics use Russian. Additionally, Abkhazia also uses Abkhaz, and South Ossetia uses Ossetian. Azerbaijan's sole official language is Azerbaijani, but the unrecognized de facto independent republic of Nagorno-Karabakh uses Armenian as its sole language. Additionally, Serbia's sole official language is Cyrillic Serbian, but within the country, Latin script for Serbian is also widely used.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alphasyllabary ===

An [[abugida]], or ''alphasyllabary'', is a segmental script in which [[vowel]] sounds are denoted by [[diacritical mark]]s or other systematic modification of the [[consonant]]s. Generally, however, if a single letter is understood to have an inherent unwritten vowel, and only vowels other than this are written, then the system is classified as an alphasyllabary regardless of whether the vowels look like diacritics or full letters. The vast majority of alphasyllabaries are found from India to Southeast Asia and belong historically to the Brāhmī family. The term abugida is derived from the first characters of the abugida in [[Ge'ez script|Ge'ez]]: አ (A) ቡ (bu) ጊ (gi) ዳ (da) — (compare with ''[[Alphabet#Etymology|alphabet]]''). Unlike abjads, the diacritical marks and systemic modifications of the consonants are not optional.

====Final consonant-diacritic abugidas====
In at least one abugida, not only the vowel but any [[syllable coda|syllable-final]] consonant is written with a diacritic. For example, representing [o] with an under-ring, and final [k] with an over-cross, [sok] would be written as {{IPA|s̥̽}}.

*[[Róng]]{{spaced ndash}} [[Lepcha language|Lepcha]]

====Vowel-based abugidas====
In a few abugidas, the vowels are basic, and the consonants secondary. If no consonant is written in Pahawh Hmong, it is understood to be /k/; consonants are written after the vowel they precede in speech. In Japanese Braille, the vowels but not the consonants have independent status, and it is the vowels which are modified when the consonant is ''y'' or ''w''.

== Undeciphered systems that may be writing ==
{{Main|Undeciphered writing systems}}
These systems have not been deciphered. In some cases, such as [[Meroitic script|Meroitic]], the sound values of the glyphs are known, but the texts still cannot be read because the language is not understood. Several of these systems, such as [[Isthmian script|Epi-Olmec]] and [[Indus script|Indus]], are claimed to have been deciphered, but these claims have not been confirmed by independent researchers. In many cases it is doubtful that they are actually writing. The [[Vinča symbols]] appear to be [[proto-writing]], and [[quipu]] may have recorded only numerical information. There are doubts that [[Indus script|Indus]] is writing, and the [[Phaistos Disc]] has so little content or context that its nature is undetermined.

*[[Ba–Shu scripts]]
*[[Byblos syllabary]]{{spaced ndash}} the city of [[Byblos]]
*[[Isthmian script|Isthmian]] (apparently logosyllabic)
*[[Indus script|Indus]]{{spaced ndash}} [[Indus Valley Civilization]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14664">'''Mel Chin''' (born 1951 in [[Houston, Texas]], USA) is a [[conceptual art|conceptual]] visual artist. Motivated largely by political, cultural, and social circumstances, Chin works in a variety of art media to calculate meaning in modern life. Chin places art in landscapes, in public spaces, and in gallery and museum exhibitions, but his work is not limited to specific venues. Chin once stated: “Making objects and marks is also about making possibilities, making choices—and that is one of the last freedoms we have. To provide that is one of the functions of art.” &lt;ref name="art"&gt;Ned Rifkin. ''Directions: Mel Chin, February 1- April 23, 1989''. Hishorn Museum and Sculpture Garden Brochure, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
[[File:Seesaw - Mel Chin.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''See/Saw: The Earthworks'', 1976]]
In 1975, Chin graduated from [[Peabody College]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Shortly after, in 1976, Chin created ''See/Saw: The Earthworks'' for [[Hermann Park]] in [[Houston, Texas]], where the artist manipulated two sections of the park’s surface to create a kinetic, minimalist [[Earthworks (art)|earthwork]]. In this mimic of a childhood pastime, Chin altered the landscape with an underground hydraulic device that allowed the participant to shift large sections of earth with their body weight. The title also questions psychological perception of what is above and below an object's surface. This piece addressed three of the major art trends of the time: [[minimalism]], [[conceptualism]], and [[Earthworks (art)|earthworks]].

[[File:'The Manila Palm', sculpture by Mel Chin, Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, 1978.JPG|thumb|right|300px|'The Manila Palm', sculpture by Mel Chin, [[Contemporary Arts Museum Houston]], 1978]]
In 1983, Chin moved to New York City. He created ''MYRRHA P.I.A. (Post Industrial Age)'' (1984), site specific to [[Bryant Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Susan Heller |last1=Anderson |first2=David |last2=Bird |title=The See-Through Woman Of Bryant Park |date=August 14, 1984 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/14/nyregion/new-york-day-by-day-the-see-through-woman-of-bryant-park.html |work=New York Times |accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commissioned by the [[Public Art Fund]], the work was based on a [[Gustave Doré]] engraving depicting [[Myrrha]] in the 30th canto of Hell from [[Dante]]’s [[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]. Chin created a three-dimensional figurative sculpture employing 19th century fabrication techniques, conjoined with space-age materials.

In 1989, Chin had a one-person exhibition at the [[Hirshhorn Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] In ''The Operation of the Sun through the Cult of the Hand'' (1987), Chin addressed ancient [[Greek philosophy]] and [[Chinese philosophy]]. He investigated mythological constructions, and scientific information to contradict personal interpretations in the formulations of these works. Chin used nine planets of the solar system to launch this elaborate construction. The installation comments on the origins of word material and form from East and West by drawing upon mythology, alchemy, and science in each culture.

Also in this exhibition were three major pieces with political content; ''The Extraction of Plenty from What Remains: 1823-'' (1989) is composed of two replicated [[White House]] columns that squeeze a cornucopia hand-crafted of mahogany, banana, mud, coffee, and goats’ blood. In this artwork Chin reacted to the long history of American foreign policy that has fractured the ability of [[Latin America]]n countries to prosper on their own. The date in the title 1823-(ongoing) is in reference to the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. ''The Sigh of the True Cross'' (1988) is based on a single string Ethiopian masinqo, or  [[spike fiddle]]. Chin compounds the iconography of the musical instrument and the [[hammer and sickle]] to comment on famine, drought, failed politics, and foreign aid in the history of [[Ethiopia]]. ''The Opera of Silence'' (1988) is also complex and layered with meaning. An oversized [[Beijing opera drum]] rests on a staff made of human thigh bone, and the drum skins are woven into the emblem of the [[C.I.A.]] commenting on the interrelations of China, [[Tibet]], and the C.I.A..

Chin conceptually developed the [[GALA Committee]] for the project called ''In the Name of the Place''. ''In the Name of the Place'' covertly inserted art objects on the set of the [[prime-time]] television series ''[[Melrose Place]]''. Chin claimed, “I realized that somewhere in those industries was where I wanted to develop this conceptual public art project. At the same time I was thinking of the virus as a paradigm for this art project. Viruses are self-replicating, but they mutate, and to me, that’s like an art idea. I was wondering, how do you get an idea into a system, and let it replicate within that system? Using the virus as a model, how could I interact with television?” &lt;ref name="television"&gt;Tom Finkelpearl.''Interview: Mel Chin on Revival Field'', in ''Dialogues in Public Art'', Cambridge: The MIT Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;“Syndicated television as a host can serve as a place for the generational transfer of an idea.” &lt;ref name="insignificance"&gt;Interview with artist, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea to make an impression upon prime time television worked—and the project successfully placed fine art into popular culture. [[Sotheby's]] in Los Angeles auctioned the objects with proceeds going to two educational charities.

[[File:dopwiki.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Degrees of Paradise'', 1992]]
In 1992, Chin created ''Degrees of Paradise'' to be shown at the [[Storefront for Art and Architecture]] in New York City. Chin commissioned [[Kurd]]ish weavers to create a 9 foot by 23 foot carpet with patterns based on [[satellite telemetry]]. This was installed in the ceiling of one triangular room. In a second similar-shaped room, overhead monitors projected active [[3D computer graphics|3-D]] mathematically derived cloud patterns. The hand woven [[Turkish carpet]] juxtaposed with video monitors continued Chin’s commentary of new and old digital traditions by paying homage to both. This project was a precursor to ''The State of Heaven'' (not realized). Chin envisioned a massive carpet 66 feet by 66 feet that would represent the entire atmospheric envelope with each knot equating {{convert|5|sqmi|km2|0}}. The carpet was to be destroyed and rewoven in a constant process according to the depletion or accretion of the ozone hole. This was an attempt to make visible a phenomenon that we normally cannot see.

After a series of successful gallery and museum exhibits, Chin abandoned object making to pursue an activist, ecological artwork.  He began ''Revival Field'' in 1990. As a conceptual and scientifically grounded work ''Revival Field'' was developed with the intention of green remediation and ecological consciousness. In this landscape art project, Chin, with scientist, Dr [[Rufus Chaney]], used plants called [[hyperaccumulators]] that are known for their ability to draw heavy metals from soil. Chin’s project was located in the Pig’s Eye Landfill in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] for three years. [[Plot markers]] were placed to identify the individual plots. Inside them were Zinc, Copper, and Lead, all containing the correct ratios of the amount of metal in the soil. The project was not about the formal configuration but the conceptual realization of scientific process brought forth through art.  Other ''Revival Field'' sites have been located in [[Palmerton, Pennsylvania]] and [[Stuttgart]], Germany. This project materialized science, technology and art, while not adhering to the traditional object making of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://melchin.org/oeuvre/plot-marker-used-in-revival-field|title=Plot Marker, used in Revival Field – mel chin|website=melchin.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chin was featured on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] series [[Art:21 - Art in the 21st Century]] where his pieces ''S.P.A.W.N.'' and ''KNOWMAD'' and ''Revival Field'' were highlighted. In ''S.P.A.W.N.'' Chin planned to reclaim abandoned buildings in the city of Detroit, Michigan. He looked at neglected homes that once thrived as a starting point for community development.  ''KNOWMAD'' explored persecuted cultures and used traditional tribal woven rugs in an interactive computer video game. He developed this project collaboratively with computer software engineers, with the hope of shedding light upon forgotten cultures and forgotten people.

In 2008 Chin proposed the idea of [[CLI- mate]] (climate linked individual- mate). [[CLI- mate]] is an app that is accessible in any language and free for its users.
The idea is that it will personalize anyone’s relationship with climate change.
Users input their daily habits, the app combines their information with every single users and it calculates their impact on the planet. Users will be able to combine their faces with the worlds. The app is missing information on climate changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://melchin.org/oeuvre/cli-mate|title=CLI-Mate – mel chin|website=melchin.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Mel Chin was invited as a visiting artist at [[East Tennessee State University]]. While there, he completed the W.M.D. ("Warehouse of Mass Distribution"), which was driven to Houston, Texas in May, 2005, to participate in the [[Houston Art Car Parade]].

[[File:24.OSFlower.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Our Strange Flower of Democracy,'' 2005]]
The [[Station Museum of Contemporary Art]] held a major exhibition in Houston, Texas (2006) entitled ''Do Not Ask Me''. Prevailing themes that run through the work selected in this exhibition include war, social injustice, modern media, and individuality. Solo exhibitions of Chin’s art have appeared the [[Walker Art Center]], [[Minneapolis]], MN, [[The Menil Collection]], [[Houston]], TX, [[Storefront for Art and Architecture]], New York, and [[The Fabric Workshop and Museum]], [[Philadelphia]], PA.

In 2006 the [[Frederieke Taylor Gallery]] in New York City featured a selection of pieces from the "Do Not Ask Me" exhibit, originally shown at the Station Museum, as well as new drawings. Chin exhibited "KNOWMAD" as well as "Render" at Frederieke Taylor Gallery in 2000 and 2003.

''9/11-9/11'' (2006) is Chin’s first animated film. Based on a graphic novella of the same name, which he wrote in 2002, it is a fictional love story set in [[Santiago, Chile]], 1973 and New York City, 2001. Chin’s film deals with the human impact of trauma and tragedy brought forth not by fate but by covert political machinations. Chin is the creator/director working with a 2-D, Chilean animation team.

Chin is compelled to make art in spite of his dark world view which is in keeping with his philosophy of “taking action as resistance to insignificance." &lt;ref name="insignificance"/&gt;

Mel Chin is the recipient of multiple awards including the US [[National Endowment for the Arts]], [[New York State Council for the Arts]], [[Art Matters]], [[Creative Capital]], and the [[Penny McCall]], Pollock/Krasner, [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Rockefeller]] and [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] Foundations and [[Nancy Graves]] Foundation Award. In 2010 he won a Fellow award granted by [[United States Artists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/Public2/Home/index.cfm United States Artists Official Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110032536/http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/Public2/Home/index.cfm |date=November 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mel Chin has also exhibited in numerous group shows including the Fifth Biennial of [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]; Seventh Architectural Biennial in [[Venice]], Italy; [[Kwangju Biennale]], Korea; [[Hirshhorn Museum]], [[Washington D.C.]]; [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]]; the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]; [[P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center]]; [[Museum of Modern Art]];  and the [[Asian American Arts Centre]], New York City among others.

In 2006 Mel Chin visited New Orleans after hurricane [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] to evaluate with fellow artists creative solutions to cure the aftermath of destruction as result of the storm. Chin began [[Operation Paydirt]] to find a solution for the high lead contimination in the soil of New Orleans, a problem that existed before Katrina. To assist the funding of [[Operation Paydirt]], the [[Fundred Dollar Bill Project]] was implemented in schools across the United States to symbolically raise 300,000,000 dollars to propose to Congress for an exchange of real dollars in the Summer of 2010.

In 2010 Chin received the biennial [[Fritschy Culture Award]] from the museum Het Domein, [[Sittard]] the Netherlands. "The jury praises the unique way in which Chin, in many of his projects, creates a form of art in which participation and other forms of engagement are key. In awarding the Fritschy Culture Award 2010 to Mel Chin, the jury members emphasize the critical engaged nature of this prize and the expression of contemporary global issues."&lt;ref&gt;[[Museum Het Domein]], Sittard, Official Website [http://www.hetdomein.nl/index.php?t=content&amp;p=447]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[Fritschy Culture Award]], Mel Chin exhibited a solo show at the museum Het Domein, titled "Disputed Territories".

Chin has been included in the Asian American Arts Centre's art Asia America digital archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artasiamerica.org/artist/detail/60|title=Chin, Mel - Profile - artasiamerica - A Digital Archive for Asian / Asian American Contemporary Art History|website=artasiamerica.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Granulometry}}

'''Mesh''' is a measurement of particle size often used in determining the [[particle-size distribution]] of a [[granular material]].  For example, a sample from a truckload of peanuts may be placed atop a mesh with 5&amp;nbsp;mm openings. When the mesh is shaken, small broken pieces and dust pass through the mesh while whole peanuts are retained on the mesh.  A commercial peanut buyer might use a test like this to determine if a batch of peanuts has too many broken pieces.  This type of test is common in some industries, and, to facilitate uniform testing methods, several standardized mesh series have been established.

Metal surfaces [[metal polishing|mechanically polished]] are designated as having a [[mechanical finish]] related to the abrasive used.

Many mesh sizes were historically given in the number of holes per inch; due to the width of the wires in the mesh, mesh numbers did not correspond directly to fractional inch sizes, and several different systems standardized with slightly different mesh sizes for the same mesh numbers.

Equivalent mesh sizes from 5&amp;nbsp;μm to 25.4&amp;nbsp;mm also exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Equivalent mesh sizes from 5microns to 25.4mm | url = http://delloyd.50megs.com/moreinfo/mesh.html | accessdate = 2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Particle Size Conversion | url = http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/chemistry/stockroom-reagents/learning-center/technical-library/particle-size-conversion.html | accessdate = 2012-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Available sieve sizes are usually regulated by standards.  Those in common use are ISO 565:1990 and ISO 3310-1:2000 (international), EN 933-1(European) and ASTM E11:01 (US).  EN standards are available with national 'badging' so appear as BS EN, FR EN, DE, etc.

== Practical sizes ==

Although such information contains long lists of sieve sizes, in practice sieves are normally used in series in which each member sieve is selected to pass particles approximately 1/{{radic|2}} or 1/2 smaller in size than the previous sieve.  For example the series 80mm, 63, 40, 31.5, 20, 16, 14, 10, 8, 6.3, 4, 2.8, 2&amp;nbsp;mm is routinely available in many European countries or the series with the larger steps 63, 31.5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1&amp;nbsp;mm, 500&amp;nbsp;μm, 250, 125, 63&amp;nbsp;μm is commonly used to grade aggregates in the construction industry.  Such series are somewhat derived from the principles originally established by Renard and now known as [[Renard series]]. Some users replace some of those indicated above with 45, 22.4, 12.5, 11.2 and 5.6&amp;nbsp;mm sieves, mostly because of historical usage of such sizes in their country or industry.

[[Image:IngresOdipusAndSphinx.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Oedipus]] describes the riddle of the [[Sphinx]]'', by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], (ca. 1805).]]
The '''Oedipus complex''' (also spelled '''Œdipus complex''') is a concept of [[psychoanalytic theory]]. [[Sigmund Freud]] introduced the concept in his ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams|Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1899) and coined the expression in his ''A Special Type of Choice of Object made by Men'' (1910).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Nagera |editor-first=Humberto |chapter=Oedipus complex (pp. 64ff.) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=_tcUbPPdf8AC&amp;pg=PA64 |title=Basic Psychoanalytic Concepts on the Libido Theory |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_tcUbPPdf8AC&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=2012 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=iD1qAAAAMAAJ 1969] |publisher=Karnac Books |location=London |isbn=1-78181098-2 |id={{ISBN|978-1-781-81098-9}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LP"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Laplanche |first2=Jean-Bertrand |last2=Pontalis |authorlink1=Jean Laplanche |authorlink2=Jean-Bertrand Pontalis |chapter=Oedipus complex (pp. 282ff.) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=%22Oedipus+complex%22 |title=The Language of Psycho-analysis |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;printsec=frontcover |publisher=Karnac Books| location=London |year=1988 |edition=reprint, revised |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=tV99AAAAMAAJ 1973] |id={{ISBN|0-94643949-4}} |isbn=978-0-946-43949-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The positive Oedipus complex refers to a child's [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] sexual desire for the opposite-sex parent and hatred for the same-sex parent. The negative Oedipus complex refers to a child's unconscious sexual desire for the same-sex parent and hatred for the opposite-sex parent.&lt;ref name="LP"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Auchincloss&gt;{{cite book | last=Auchincloss, M. D. | first=Elizabeth | title=The Psychoanalytic Model of the Mind| year=2015 | publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Auchincloss2&gt;{{cite book | last=Auchincloss M. D. | first=Elizabeth | title=Psychoanalytic Terms and Concepts| year=2012 | publisher=American Psychoanalytic Association |page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud considered that the child's identification with the same-sex parent is the successful outcome of the complex and that unsuccessful outcome of the complex might lead to [[neurosis]], [[pedophilia]], and [[homosexuality]].

Freud deprecated the term "[[Electra complex]]", which was introduced by [[Carl Gustav Jung]] in 1913 in regard to the Oedipus complex manifested in young girls. Freud further proposed that the Oedipus complex, which originally refers to the sexual desire of a son for his mother, is a desire for the parent in both males and females, and that boys and girls experience the complex differently: boys in a form of [[castration anxiety]], girls in a form of [[penis envy]].

==Background==
[[Image:AmaliaFreud.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Ego psychology|psychologist]] [[Sigmund Freud]] (at age 16) with his mother in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay (1995) ''[[Freud: A Life for Our Time]]''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

''Oedipus'' refers to a 5th-century BC [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] character [[Oedipus]], who unwittingly kills his father, [[Laius]], and marries his mother, [[Jocasta]]. A play based on the myth, ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', was written by [[Sophocles]], ca. 429 BC.

Modern productions of Sophocles' play were staged in Paris and Vienna in the 19th century and were phenomenally successful in the 1880s and 1890s. The Austrian [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]], [[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939), attended. In his book ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' first published in 1899, he proposed that an Oedipal desire is a universal, psychological phenomenon innate ([[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]]) to human beings, and the cause of much unconscious guilt. Freud believed that the Oedipal sentiment has been inherited through the millions of years it took for humans to evolve from apes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Basic Freud: Psychoanalytic Thought for the 21st Century|last=Khan|first=Michael|publisher=Basic Books|year=2002|isbn=0-465-03715-1|location=New York, NY|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; He based this on his analysis of his feelings attending the play, his anecdotal observations of neurotic or normal children, and on the fact that '' Oedipus Rex'' was effective on both ancient and modern audiences. (He also claimed that the play ''[[Hamlet]]'' "has its roots in the same soil as ''Oedipus Rex''", and that the differences between the two plays are revealing. "In [''Oedipus Rex''] the child’s wishful fantasy that underlies it is brought into the open and realized as it would be in a dream. In ''Hamlet'' it remains repressed; and—just as in the case of a neurosis—we only learn of its existence from its inhibiting consequences.")&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund.

However, in ''The Interpretation of Dreams'', Freud makes it clear that the "primordial urges and fears" that are his concern and the basis of the Oedipal complex are inherent in the myths the play by Sophocles is based on, not primarily in the play itself, which Freud refers to as a "further modification of the legend" that originates in a "misconceived secondary revision of the material, which has sought to exploit it for theological purposes".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund.

Freud described the character [[Oedipus]]:

A six-stage chronology of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theoretic evolution of the Oedipus complex is:

*Stage 1. 1897–1909. After his father's death in 1896, and having seen the play ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', by [[Sophocles]], Freud begins using the term "Oedipus". As Freud wrote in an 1897 letter, "I found in myself a constant love for my mother, and jealousy of my father. I now consider this to be a universal event in early childhood. 
*Stage 2. 1909–1914. Proposes that Oedipal [[libido|desire]] is the "nuclear complex" of all neuroses; first usage of "Oedipus complex" in 1910.
*Stage 3. 1914–1918. Considers paternal and maternal [[incest]].
*Stage 4. 1919–1926. Complete Oedipus complex; [[identification (psychology)|identification]] and [[bisexuality]] are conceptually evident in later works.
*Stage 5. 1926–1931. Applies the Oedipal theory to religion and [[Norm (social)|custom]].
*Stage 6. 1931–1938. Investigates the "feminine Oedipus attitude" and "negative Oedipus complex"; later the "Electra complex".&lt;ref&gt;Bennett Simon, Rachel B. Blass "The development of vicissitudes of Freud's ideas on the Oedipus complex" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Freud'' (University of California Press 1991) p.000&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Oedipus complex===
[[File:Oedipus and the Sphinx MET DP-14201-023.jpg|thumb|upright|''Oedipus and the Sphinx'', by  [[Gustave Moreau]] (1864)]]
In classical [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theory, the Oedipus complex occurs during the [[phallic stage]] of [[psychosexual development]] (age 3–6 years), when also occurs the formation of the [[libido]] and the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]]; yet it might manifest itself at an earlier age.&lt;ref name="JosephChilders"&gt;Joseph Childers, Gary Hentzi eds. ''Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism''  (New York: Columbia University Press, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Rycroft ''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (London, 2nd ed., 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[phallic stage]], a boy's decisive psychosexual experience is the Oedipus complex—his son–father competition for possession of mother. It is in this third stage of [[psychosexual development]] that the child's genitalia is his or her primary [[erogenous zone]]; thus, when children become aware of their bodies, the bodies of other children, and the bodies of their parents, they gratify physical curiosity by undressing and exploring themselves, each other, and their genitals, so learning the [[Human anatomy|anatomic]] differences between "male" and "female" and the [[gender]] differences between "boy" and "girl".

''Psychosexual infantilism''—Despite mother being the parent who primarily gratifies the child's [[Libido|desires]], the child begins forming a discrete sexual identity—"boy", "girl"—that alters the dynamics of the parent and child relationship; the parents become objects of infantile [[Libido|libidinal]] energy. The boy directs his libido (sexual desire) upon his mother and directs jealousy and emotional rivalry against his father—because it is he who sleeps with his mother. Moreover, to facilitate union with mother, the boy's [[Id, ego and super-ego|id]] wants to kill father (as did [[Oedipus]]), but the pragmatic [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]], based upon the [[reality principle]], knows that the father is the stronger of the two males competing to possess the one female. Nonetheless, the boy remains ambivalent about his father's place in the family, which is manifested as [[castration anxiety|fear of castration]] by the physically greater father; the fear is an irrational, subconscious manifestation of the infantile id.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Bullock, Stephen Trombley ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' (London:Harper Collins 1999)  pp. 607, 705&lt;/ref&gt;

''Psycho-logic defense''—In both sexes, [[defense mechanism]]s provide transitory resolutions of the conflict between the drives of the id and the drives of the ego. The first defense mechanism is [[Psychological repression|repression]], the blocking of memories, emotional impulses, and ideas from the conscious mind; yet its action does not resolve the id–ego conflict. The second defense mechanism is [[Identification (psychology)|identification]], in which the boy or girl child adapts by incorporating, to his or her (super)ego, the personality characteristics of the same-sex parent. As a result of this, the boy diminishes his [[castration anxiety]], because his likeness to father protects him from father's wrath in their maternal rivalry. In the case of the girl, this facilitates identifying with mother, who understands that, in being females, neither of them possesses a penis, and thus are not antagonists.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Bullock, Stephen Trombley ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' (London:Harper Collins 1999) pp. 205, 107&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dénouement''—Unresolved son–father competition for the psycho-sexual possession of the mother might result in a [[phallic stage]] [[Fixation (psychology)|fixation]] that leads to the boy becoming an aggressive, over-ambitious, and vain man. Therefore, the satisfactory parental handling and resolution of the Oedipus complex are most important in developing the male infantile [[super-ego]]. This is because, by identifying with a parent, the boy [[Internalization|internalizes]] [[Morality]]; thereby, he chooses to comply with societal rules, rather than reflexively complying in fear of punishment.

===Oedipal case study===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Sigmund Freud]] --&gt;
[[Image:1869 Frederic Leighton - Electra at the Tomb of Agamemnon.jpg|thumb|upright|Female Oedipus attitude: ''Electra at the Tomb of [[Agamemnon]]'', by [[Frederic Leighton]], (c.1869).]]
In ''Analysis of a Phobia in a Five-year-old Boy'' (1909), the case study of the [[Equinophobia|equinophobic]] boy "[[Little Hans]]", Freud showed that the relation between Hans's fears—of horses and of his father—derived from external factors, the birth of a sister, and internal factors, the desire of the infantile id to replace father as companion to mother, and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] for enjoying the [[masturbation]] normal to a boy of his age. Moreover, his admitting to wanting to procreate with mother was considered proof of the boy's [[Libido|sexual attraction]] to the opposite-sex parent; he was a heterosexual male. Yet, the boy Hans was unable to relate fearing horses to fearing his father. As the treating [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]], Freud noted that "Hans had to be told many things that he could not say himself" and that "he had to be presented with thoughts, which he had, so far, shown no signs of possessing".&lt;ref&gt;Frank Cioffi (2005) "Sigmund Freud" entry ''The Oxford Guide to Philosophy'' Oxford University Press:New York pp. 323–324&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminine Oedipus attitude===
Initially, Freud equally applied the Oedipus complex to the [[psychosexual development]] of boys and girls, but later modified the female aspects of the theory as "feminine Oedipus attitude" and "negative Oedipus complex";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freud|first=Sigmund |authorlink=Sigmund Freud|title=On Sexuality |year=1956 |publisher=Penguin Books Ltd |location= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; yet, it was his student–collaborator [[Carl Jung]], who, in 1913, proposed the [[Electra complex]] to describe a girl's daughter–mother competition for psychosexual possession of the father.&lt;ref name="www.credoreference.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/topic/freud_sigmund_1856_1939?searchId=67d623b9-ceca-11e4-9c20-0aea1e24c1ac |title=Freud, Sigmund (1856-1939) |publisher=credoreference.com |accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[phallic stage]], a girl's Electra complex is her decisive [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic]] experience in forming a discrete sexual identity ([[Ego (Freudian)|ego]]). Whereas a boy develops [[castration anxiety]], a girl develops [[penis envy]] rooted in anatomic fact: without a penis, she cannot sexually possess mother, as the infantile id demands. Resultantly, the girl redirects her [[libido|desire]] for sexual union upon father, thus progressing to [[heterosexual]] femininity, which culminates in bearing a child, who replaces the absent [[penis]].&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesisi &amp; Forrester (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, after the phallic stage, the girl's psychosexual development includes transferring her primary erogenous zone from the infantile [[clitoris]] to the adult [[vagina]].

Freud thus considered a girl's negative Oedipus complex to be more emotionally intense than that of a boy, resulting, potentially, in a woman of submissive, insecure [[Id, ego and super-ego|personality]];&lt;ref&gt;Allan Bullock, Stephen Trombley ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' Harper Collins:London (1999) pp. 259, 705&lt;/ref&gt; thus might an unresolved Electra complex, daughter–mother competition for psychosexual possession of father, lead to a phallic-stage [[Fixation (psychology)|fixation]] conducive to a girl becoming a woman who continually strives to dominate men (viz. [[penis envy]]), either as an unusually [[Femme fatale|seductive woman]] (high self-esteem) or as an unusually submissive woman (low self-esteem). Therefore, the satisfactory parental handling and resolution of the Electra complex are most important in developing the female infantile [[super-ego]], because, by identifying with a parent, the girl internalizes [[morality]]; thereby, she chooses to comply with societal rules, rather than reflexively complying in fear of punishment.

===In regard to narcissism===
In regard to [[narcissism]], the Oedipus complex is viewed as the pinnacle of the individual's maturational striving for success or for love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pederson|first1=Trevor|title=The Economics of Libido: Psychic Bisexuality, the Superego, and the Centrality of the Oedipus Complex|date=2015|publisher=karnac}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Economic Problem of Masochism'' (1924), Freud writes that in "the Oedipus complex... [the parent's] personal significance for the superego recedes into the background' and 'the imagos they leave behind... link [to] the influences of teachers and authorities...". Educators and mentors are put in the ego ideal of the individual and they strive to take on their knowledge, skills, or insights.

In ''Some Reflections on Schoolboy Psychology'' (1914), Freud writes:
:"We can now understand our relation to our schoolmasters. These men, not all of whom were in fact fathers themselves, became our substitute fathers. That was why, even though they were still quite young, they struck us as so mature and so unattainably adult. We transferred on to them the respect and expectations attaching to the omniscient father of our childhood, and we then began to treat them as we treated our fathers at home. We confronted them with the ambivalence that we had acquired in our own families and with its help, we struggled with them as we had been in the habit of struggling with our fathers..."

The Oedipus complex, in narcissistic terms, represents that an individual can lose the ability to take a parental-substitute into his [[ego ideal]] without ambivalence. Once the individual has ambivalent relations with parental-substitutes, he will enter into the triangulating castration complex. In the castration complex the individual becomes rivalrous with parental-substitutes and this will be the point of regression. In ''Psycho-analytic notes on an autobiographical account of a case of paranoia (Dementia paranoides)'' (1911), Freud writes that "disappointment over a woman" (object drives) or "a mishap in social relations with other men" (ego drives) is the cause of regression or symptom formation. Triangulation can take place with a romantic rival, for a woman, or with a work rival, for the reputation of being more potent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pederson|first1=Trevor|title=The Economics of Libido: Psychic Bisexuality, the Superego, and the Centrality of the Oedipus Complex|date=2015|publisher=Karnac}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freudian theoretic revision==
When [[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939) proposed that the Oedipus complex was psychologically universal, he provoked the evolution of [[Ego psychology|Freudian psychology]] and the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] treatment method, by collaborators and competitors alike.

===Carl Gustav Jung===
[[Image:Electra and Orestes - Project Gutenberg eText 14994.png|thumb|left|The Electra complex: the [[matricide]]s Electra and Orestes.]]

In countering Freud's proposal that the [[psychosexual development]] of boys and girls is equal, i.e. equally oriented – that each initially experiences sexual desire ([[libido]]) for mother, and aggression towards father, student–collaborator [[Carl Jung]] counter-proposed that girls experienced desire for father and aggression towards mother via the [[Electra complex]]{{citation needed|reason=Where did Jung write about this? What primary text from Jung?|date=January 2016}}—derived from the 5th-century BC Greek mythologic character [[Electra]], who plotted [[Matricide|matricidal]] revenge with [[Orestes]], her brother, against [[Clytemnestra]], their mother, and [[Aegisthus]], their stepfather, for their murder of [[Agamemnon]], her father (cf. ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'', by Sophocles).&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Bruce (1996). ''Benét's Reader's Encyclopedia'' Fourth edition, HarperCollins Publishers:New York p. 310&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Robert E. (1991) ''Women of Classical Mythology: A Biographical Dictionary'' Oxford University Press:California pp.177–78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hornblower, S., Spawforth, A. (1998) ''The Oxford Companion to Classical Civilization'' pp. 254–55&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover, because it is native to [[Ego psychology|Freudian psychology]], orthodox Jungian psychology uses the term "Oedipus complex" only to denote a boy's psychosexual development.

===Otto Rank===
[[File:Freud and other psychoanalysts 1922.jpg|thumb|Oedipus complex: [[Otto Rank]] behind [[Sigmund Freud]], and other psychoanalysts (1922).]]

In classical [[Ego psychology|Freudian psychology]] the [[super-ego]], "the heir to the Oedipus complex", is formed as the infant boy [[Internalization|internalizes]] the familial rules of his father. In contrast, in the early 1920s, using the term "pre-Oedipal", [[Otto Rank]] proposed that a boy's powerful mother was the source of the super-ego, in the course of normal [[psychosexual development]]. Rank's theoretic conflict with Freud excluded him from the Freudian inner circle; nonetheless, he later developed the [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic]] [[Object relations theory]] in 1925.

===Melanie Klein===
Whereas Freud proposed that father (the paternal phallus) was central to infantile and adult [[psychosexual development]], [[Melanie Klein]] concentrated upon the early maternal relationship, proposing that Oedipal manifestations are perceptible in the first year of life, the [[oral stage]]. Her proposal was part of the "[[controversial discussions]]" (1942–44) at the British Psychoanalytical Association. The Kleinian psychologists proposed that "underlying the Oedipus complex, as Freud described it ... there is an earlier layer of more primitive relationships with the Oedipal couple".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Appignanesi ed. ''Introducing Melanie Klein'' (Cambridge 2006) p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;  She assigned “dangerous destructive tendencies not just to the father but also to the mother in her discussion of the child’s projective fantasies”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreover, Klein's work lessened the central role of the Oedipus complex, with the concept of the [[depressive position]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Rycroft ''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis''
(London, 2nd Edn, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism (New York: Columbia University Press, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wilfred Bion===
[[File:Wilfred Bion 1916.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Wilfred Bion]] (1916)]]
"For the post–[[Melanie Klein|Kleinian]] [[Wilfred Bion|Bion]], the myth of Oedipus concerns investigatory curiosity—the quest for knowledge—rather than sexual difference; the other main character in the Oedipal drama becomes [[Tiresias]] (the false hypothesis erected against [[anxiety]] about a new theory)".&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jacobus, ''The Poetics of Psychoanalysis'' (London 2005) p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; Resultantly, "Bion regarded the central crime of Oedipus as his insistence on knowing the truth at all costs".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Parsons ''The Dove that Returns, the Dove that Vanishes'' (London 2000) p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jacques Lacan===
From the [[postmodern]] perspective, [[Jacques Lacan]] argued against removing the Oedipus complex from the center of psychosexual developmental experience. He considered "the Oedipus complex—in so far as we continue to recognize it as covering the whole field of our experience with its signification ... [that] superimposes the kingdom of culture" upon the person, marking his or her introduction to [[symbolic order]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus "a child learns what [[Power (philosophy)|power]] independent of itself is as it goes through the Oedipus complex ... encountering the existence of a symbolic system independent of itself".&lt;ref&gt;Ian Parker, ''Japan in Analysis'' (Basingstoke 2008) pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Lacan's proposal that "the ternary relation of the Oedipus complex" liberates the "prisoner of the dual relationship" of the son–mother relationship proved useful to later psychoanalysts;&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits'' pp. 218, 182&lt;/ref&gt; thus, for [[Bollas]], the "achievement" of the Oedipus complex is that the "child comes to understand something about the oddity of possessing one's own [[mind]] ... discovers the multiplicity of points of view".&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, for Ronald Britton, "if the link between the parents perceived in love and hate can be tolerated in the child's mind ... this provides us with a capacity for seeing us in interaction with others, and ... for reflecting on ourselves, whilst being ourselves".&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Wood ''On a Darkling Plain: Journey into the Unconscious'' (Cambridge 2002) "Ronald Britton" entry p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; As such, in ''The Dove that Returns, the Dove that Vanishes'' (2000), Michael Parsons proposed that such a perspective permits viewing "the Oedipus complex as a life-long developmental challenge ... [with] new kinds of Oedipal configurations that belong to later life".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Parsons ''The Dove that Returns, the Dove that Vanishes'' (London 2000) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote that "with the progress of [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] studies the importance of the Oedipus complex has become, more and more, clearly evident; its recognition has become the ''shibboleth'' that distinguishes the adherents of psychoanalysis from its opponents";&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Sexuality'' pp. 149-50nn&lt;/ref&gt; thereby it remained a theoretic cornerstone of psychoanalysis until about 1930, when psychoanalysts began investigating the pre-Oedipal son–mother relationship within the theory of [[psychosexual development]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Rycroft ''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis''
(London, 2nd Ed., 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1995) p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Janet Malcolm reports that by the late 20th century, to the object relations psychology "[[avant-garde]], the events of the Oedipal period are pallid and inconsequential, in comparison with the cliff-hanging [[psychodrama]]s of infancy. ... For [[Kohut]], as for [[Winnicott]] and [[Balint]], the Oedipus complex is an irrelevance in the treatment of severe [[psychopathology|pathology]]".&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) pp. 35, 136&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, [[ego psychology]] continued to maintain that "the Oedipal period—roughly three-and-a-half to six years—is like [[Konrad Lorenz|Lorenz]] standing in front of the chick, it is the most formative, significant, moulding experience of human life ... If you take a person's adult life—his love, his work, his hobbies, his ambitions—they all point back to the Oedipus complex".&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988), "Aaron Green", pp. 158–59 [https://books.google.com/books?id=5_9492Mhn_IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Malcolm,+Psychoanalysis:+The+Impossible+Profession+Aaron+Green%22,&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIr_6Bq9qIyQIVi7YeCh0aqAZk#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}
According to Armand Chatard, Freudian representation of the Oedipus complex is little or not at all supported by empirical data (he relies on Kagan, 1964, Bussey and Bandura, 1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chatard|first1=Armand|date=September 2004|title=La construction sociale du genre|url=http://www2.cndp.fr/archivage/valid/66975/66975-10067-12590.pdf|journal=Diversité|volume=138|pages=23–30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140207205942/http://www2.cndp.fr/archivage/valid/66975/66975-10067-12590.pdf|archivedate=2014-02-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Postmodern criticism ===
[[File:I love my 2 gay dad's.jpg|thumb|The Oedipus Complex has been criticized for disregarding nontraditional family structures such as those families with parents of the same sex like the one depicted.]]
In recent years the more countries have come in support of same-sex marriage, with the number expected to increase. As of December 2017, the countries that have legalized gay marriage stands at 29, including the majority of European nations and the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2017-11-15/where-same-sex-marriage-has-been-legalized-around-the-world|title=Same-Sex Marriage Legalization by Country|last=Trimble|first=Megan|date=December 7, 2017|work=US News|accessdate=May 6, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507222617/https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2017-11-15/where-same-sex-marriage-has-been-legalized-around-the-world|archivedate=2018-05-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific and technological advancements have allowed gay couples to start families through adoption or surrogacy. As a result the pillars of the family structure are diversifying to include parents who are single or of the same sex as their partner along with the traditional heterosexual, married parents. These new family structures pose new questions for the psychoanalytic theories such as the Oedipus complex that require the presence of the mother and the father in the successful development of a child.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shenkman|first=Geva|date=March 23, 2015|title=Classic psychoanalysis and male same-sex parents: A reexamination of basic concepts.|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=0dc93297-44fd-49b9-9596-74abc6f9a4ba%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#AN=2015-12209-001&amp;db=psyh|journal=Psychoanalytic Psychology|volume=33|pages=585–598|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However as evidence suggest, children who have been raised by parents of the same sex have shown no difference when compared to children raised in a traditional family structure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The classic theory of the oedipal drama has fallen out of favor in today’s society, according to a study by Drescher, having been criticized for its “negative implications” towards same sex parents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is necessary for the psychoanalytic theory to change to keep up with the times and remain relevant. Many psychoanalytic thinkers such as Chodorow and Corbett are working towards changing the Oedipus complex  to eliminate “automatic associations among sex, gender, and the stereotypical psychological functions deriving from these categories” and make it applicable to today’s modern society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From its Freudian conception, psychoanalysis and its theories have always relied on traditional gender roles to draw itself out. In the 1950s psychologists distinguished different roles in parenting for the mother and father. The role of primary caregiver is assigned to the mother. Motherly love was considered to be unconditional. While the father is assigned the role of secondary caregiver, fatherly love is conditional, responsive to the child’s tangible achievements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Recent studies suggest, however, that the notions of male and female gender parenting roles and attributes are a result of culture and continuous practice in psychoanalysis with no biological basis.

".&lt;ref&gt;Didier Eribon, "Échapper à la psychanalyse", [[Éditions Léo Scheer]], 2005, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Eribon considers the Oedipus complex of Freudian or Lacanian psychoanalysis is an "implausible ideological construct" which is an "inferiorization process of homosexuality".&lt;ref name="Didier Eribon 1999"&gt;Didier Eribon, Réflexions sur la question gay, Paris, Fayard, 1999. ({{ISBN|2213600988}}), p.129&lt;/ref&gt; According to psychologist Geva Shenkman, “To examine the application of concepts such as Oedipus complex and primal scene to male same-sex families, we must first eliminate the automatic associations among sex, gender, and the stereotypical psychological functions based on these categories.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Postmodern psychoanalytic theories are not meant to rid or discredit the foundation of psychoanalysis, but rather aim to reestablish psychoanalysis for modern times. In the case of newer family structures that refute the traditional Oedipus complex, it may mean modifying or discarding the complex completely. Shenkman suggests that a loose interpretation of the Oedipus complex  in which the child seeks sexual satisfaction from any parent regardless of gender or sex, would be helpful: “From this perspective, any parental authority, or institution for that matter, may represent the taboo that gives rise to the complex”. Psychoanalyst Melanie Kline, proposed a theory which broke gender stereotypes, but still kept traditional father-mother family structure. Melanie Kline assigned “dangerous destructive tendencies not just to the father but also to the mother in her discussion of the child’s projective fantasies”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Moreover, from the [[post-modern]] perspective, Grose contends that "the Oedipus complex isn't really like that. It's more a way of explaining how human beings are [[Socialization|socialised]] ... learning to deal with [[Suffering|disappointment]]".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1232"&gt;Anouchka Grose ''No More Silly Love Songs'' (London, 2010) p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; The elementary understanding being that "You have to stop trying to be everything for your primary carer, and get on with being something for the rest of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Anouchka Grose ''No More Silly Love Songs'' (London, 2010) p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the open question remains whether or not such a post-[[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]] interpretation "stretches the Oedipus complex to a point where it almost doesn't look like Freud's any more".&lt;ref name="Didier Eribon 1999"/&gt;

=== Sociocultural criticism ===
Parent-child and sibling-sibling incestuous unions are almost universally forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;The Tapestry of Culture An Introduction to Cultural Anthropology, Ninth Edition, Abraham Rosman, Paula G. Rubel, Maxine Weisgrau, 2009, AltaMira Press, page 101&lt;/ref&gt; An explanation for this [[incest taboo]] is that rather than instinctual sexual desire, there is instinctual sexual aversion against these unions (See [[Westermarck effect]]). [[Steven Pinker]] wrote that "The idea that boys want to sleep with their mothers strikes most men as the silliest thing they have ever heard. Obviously, it did not seem so to Freud, who wrote that as a boy he once had an erotic reaction to watching his mother dressing. Of note is that [[Amalia Freud|Amalia Nathansohn Freud]] was relatively young during Freud's childhood and thus of reproductive age, and Freud having a [[wet-nurse]], may not have experienced the early intimacy that would have tipped off his perceptual system that Mrs. Freud was his mother."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36379708|title=How the mind works|last=1954-|first=Pinker, Steven|date=1997|publisher=Norton|isbn=9780393045352|location=New York|oclc=36379708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary [[psychoanalyst]]s agree with the idea of the Oedipus complex to varying degrees; [[Hans Keller]] proposed it is so "at least in Western societies";&lt;ref&gt;Hans Keller: ''1975: 1984 Minus 9'' (London, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; and others consider that [[Ethnology|ethnologists]] already have established its temporal and geographic universality.&lt;ref&gt;Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel and Bela Grunberger ''Freud or Reich?: Psychoanalysis and Illusion'' (London, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, few psychoanalysts disagree that the "child then entered an Oedipal phase ... [which] involved an acute awareness of a complicated [[Phallic stage|triangle]] involving mother, father, and child" and that "both positive and negative Oedipal themes are typically observable in [[Psychosexual development|development]]".&lt;ref&gt;Glen O. Gabbard ''Long-Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy'' (London 2010) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Despite evidence of [[Parent–offspring conflict|parent–child conflict]], the evolutionary psychologists [[Martin Daly]] and [[Margo Wilson]] note that it is not for sexual possession of the opposite sex-parent; thus, in ''Homicide'' (1988), they proposed that the Oedipus complex yields few testable predictions, because they found no evidence of the Oedipus complex in people.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Daly, Margo Wilson ''Homicide'' (New York: Aldine de Gruyter, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''No More Silly Love Songs: A Realist's Guide to Romance'' (2010), [[Anouchka Grose]] says that "a large number of people, these days believe that [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s Oedipus complex is defunct ... 'disproven', or simply found unnecessary, sometime in the last century".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1232"/&gt;

In ''Esquisse pour une autoanalyse'', [[Pierre Bourdieu]] argues that the success of the concept of Oedipus is inseparable from the prestige associated with ancient Greek culture and the relations of domination that are reinforced in the use of this myth. In other words, if Oedipus was Bantu or Baoule, he probably would not have benefited from the coronation of universality. This remark recalls the historically and socially situated character of the founder of psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Bourdieu, "Esquisse pour une auto-analyse", raisons d'agir, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence ==
A study conducted at Glasgow University potentially supports at least some aspects of the psychoanalytic conception of the Oedipus complex. The study demonstrated that men and women were twice as likely to choose a partner with the same eye color as the parent of the sex they are attracted to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/dating-romantic-partners-parents-look-like-study-relationships-attraction-a8022521.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227183215/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/dating-romantic-partners-parents-look-like-study-relationships-attraction-a8022521.html |archivedate=2017-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study by anthropologist Allen W. Johnson and psychiatrist Douglas Price-Williams suggests that the classic version of the Oedipus Complex that boys go through is present, with the sexual and aggressive sentiments less repressed in cultures without class separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Basic Freud: Psychoanalytic Thought for the 21st Century|last=Khan|first=Michael|publisher=Basic Books|year=2002|isbn=0-465-03715-1|location=New York, NY|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Precedence}}
'''Order of precedence''' is a sequential hierarchy of nominal importance of persons. Most often it is used in the context of people by many organizations and governments, for very formal and state occasions, especially where [[diplomat]]s are present. It can also be used in the context of decorations, medals and awards. Historically, the order of precedence had a more widespread use, especially in [[Royal court|court]] and aristocratic life.

A person's position in an order of [[:wikt:precedence|precedence]] is not necessarily an indication of functional importance, but rather an indication of [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] or historical relevance; for instance, it may dictate where dignitaries are seated at formal dinners.  The term is occasionally used to mean the [[order of succession]]—to determine who replaces the [[head of state]] in the event he or she is removed from office or incapacitated—as they are often identical, at least near the top.

What follows are the general orders of precedence for different countries for state purposes, such as diplomatic dinners, and are made under the assumption that such functions are held in the capital. When they are held in another city or region, local officials such as governors would be much higher up the order.  There may also be more specific and local orders of precedence, for particular occasions or within particular institutions.  [[University|Universities]] and the [[Profession|professions]] often have their own rules of precedence applying locally, based (for example) on university or professional rank, each rank then being ordered within itself on the basis of seniority (i.e. date of attaining that rank). Within an institution the officials of that institution are likely to rank much higher in the order than in a general order of precedence—the chancellor or president of a university may well precede anyone except a head of state for example. The same might be true for a mayor in his or her own city.

'''Peacemakers''' was an [[United States|American]] [[pacifist]] organization.  The name of the group was taken from a section of the Bible, the [[Beatitudes]] or Sermon on the Mount: “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.”

The group was founded following a conference on “More Disciplined and Revolutionary Pacifist Activity” in [[Chicago]] in July 1948 to advocate [[nonviolent resistance]] in the service of peace, particularly [[conscription|draft]] resistance and [[tax resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;Gross, David (ed.) ''We Won’t Pay!: A Tax Resistance Reader'' {{ISBN|1-4348-9825-3}} pp. 446-447&lt;/ref&gt;  The group’s members vowed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) to refuse to serve in the armed forces in either peace or war; (2) to refuse to make or transport weapons of war; (3) to refuse to be conscripted or to register; (4) to consider to refuse to pay taxes for war purposes — a position already adopted by some; (5) to spread the idea of peacemaking and to develop non-violent methods of opposing war through various forms of non-cooperation and to advocate unilateral disarmament and economic democracy.[http://www.manasjournal.org/pdf_library/VolumeI_1948/I-32.pdf]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The group was organized largely by [[Ernest Bromley|Ernest]] and [[Marion Bromley]] and [[Juanita Nelson|Juanita]] and [[Wally Nelson]].&lt;ref name="Cooney"&gt;Cooney, Robert and Michalowski, Helen ''The Power of the People: Active Nonviolence in the United States'' (1987) p. 115-8&lt;/ref&gt; Among the organization’s other founders were [[A.J. Muste]], [[Dwight Macdonald]], [[Ralph T. Templin]], [[Roy Kepler]], [[Cecil Hinshaw]], [[Milton Mayer]], [[Bayard Rustin]], [[George Houser]], and [[Horace Champney]]. &lt;!-- incomplete - anyone have the full list? --&gt; Many members came from the [[Committee for Nonviolent Revolution]], which had been formed two years before.&lt;ref name="Cooney" /&gt; Some other participants of note included [[Benny Bargen]], [[Dorothy Day]], [[Ralph DiGia]], [[Fyke Farmer]], [[Walter Gormly]], [[Ammon Hennacy]], [[Bradford Lyttle]], [[Maurice McCrackin]], [[Mary Stone McDowell]], [[Karl Meyer (activist)|Karl Meyer]], [[James Otsuka]], [[James Peck (pacifist)|Jim Peck]], [[Eroseanna Robinson]], [[Igal Roodenko]], [[Max Sandin]], [[George Willoughby (activist)|George Willoughby]], [[Lillian Willoughby]], and [[Edmund Wilson]].

The “Tax Refusal Committee” of Peacemakers is credited for founding the modern American war tax resistance movement.  Peacemakers published the first guide to war tax resistance in 1963. There had been examples of organized war tax resistance in America for centuries, largely in congregations of the [[historic peace churches]], but Peacemakers was the first non-sectarian organized war tax resistance group.

Peacemakers differed from other pacifist and nonviolent resistance organizations in its emphasis on small-scale, local, "cell"-based organization and [[intentional community|intentional communities]]. It had no national office, paid staff, or membership list. Some member groups organized funds to aid war resisters and people in the civil rights movement who had suffered reprisals.&lt;ref name="Cooney" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gross|first=David M.|year=2014|title=99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns|publisher=Picket Line Press|isbn=978-1490572741|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polak Model''' is a [[Monetarism|monetary]] approach to the balance of payment published by [[Jacques J. Polak|J. J. Polak]] in 1957. It seeks to model a small, open economy operating under [[Fixed exchange-rate system|fixed nominal exchange rate]]. Polak suggest explicit links between the monetary and external sectors. Polak results continue to form the theoretical bases on which the IMF Financial Programming are carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Tarp, F. (1994)  Chapter 3 ‘Financial Programming and Stabilization’, from Stabilization and Structural Adjustment: Macroeconomic Frameworks for Analyzing the Crisis in sub-Saharan Africa. p. 60-61&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polak Model is based on the following four equations:

M&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;v = Y

Z = mY

∆M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; =∆R + ∆DC

∆R = X - Z + ∆F

Where Md is the demand for money, v is the [[velocity of money]] (here considered constant), Y is the [[GDP|output]], Z is the [[imports]], m is the [[marginal propensity to import]], Ms is the [[money supply]], R is the amount of [[foreign reserves]], DC is the Domestic Credit, X is [[exports]] and F are other net [[foreign currency]] flows.

In the model the following variables are seen as [[exogenous]]:&lt;ref&gt;Tarp, F. (1994)  Chapter 3 ‘Financial Programming and Stabilization’, from Stabilization and Structural Adjustment: Macroeconomic Frameworks for Analyzing the Crisis in sub-Saharan Africa. p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Real GDP|Real Output]] (y), [[Exports]] (X), other [[foreign currency]] inflows (∆F)
∆F = NTR - INT - ∆NFA

They have to be projected during the IMF Financial Programming exercise in order to set the desired levels for the target variables which are:

[[International reserves|Level of International Reserves]] (R)
[[Inflation]], of change in price for the [[Domestic market|domestic sector]] (∆P&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) and,
[[Credit (finance)|Credit]] extended to the privet sector (∆DC&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)

The model also assumes that sooner or later the market will clear meaning that [[Money demand|demand]] and [[supply of money]] will equal, or:

∆M&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = ∆M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;

The preamble brings up the need to reform the European Union (EU) according to the principles of both liberal and conservative ideas and values. The core elements are the following ones:

- Free enterprise, free and fair trade and competition, minimal regulation, lower taxation, and small government as the ultimate catalysts for individual freedom and personal and national prosperity.

- Freedom of the individual, more personal responsibility and greater democratic accountability.

- Sustainable, clean energy supply with an emphasis on energy security.

- The importance of the family as the bedrock of society.

- The sovereign integrity of the nation state, opposition to EU federalism and a renewed respect for true subsidiarity.

- The overriding value of the transatlantic security relationship in a revitalised NATO, and support for young democracies across Europe.

- Effectively controlled immigration and an end to abuse of asylum procedures.

- Efficient and modern public services and sensitivity to the needs of both rural and urban communities.

- An end to waste and excessive bureaucracy and a commitment to greater transparency and probity in the EU institutions and use of EU funds.

- Respect and equitable treatment for all EU countries, new and old, large and small.

'''Pre-consumer recycling''' is the reclamation of waste materials that were created during the process of manufacturing or delivering goods prior to their delivery to a consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/pre-consumer-materials.html |title=pre-consumer materials |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=businessdictionary.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-consumer [[recycled]] materials can be broken down and remade into similar or different materials, or can be sold "as is" to third-party buyers who then use those materials for consumer products. One of the largest contributing industries to pre-consumer recycling is the [[textile industry]], which recycles fibers, fabrics, trims and unsold "new" garments to third-party buyers.

There are generally two types of recycling: [[post-consumer]] and pre-consumer. Post-consumer recycling is the most heavily practiced form of recycling,{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} where the materials being recycled have already passed through to the consumer.

According to the Council for Textile Recycling, each year 750,000 tons of textile waste is recycled (pre- and post-consumer) into new raw materials for the automotive, furniture, mattress, coarse yarn, home furnishings, paper and other industries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.textilerecycle.org&lt;/ref&gt; Although this amount accounts for 75% of textile waste in the United States, there is little research on textile excess produced in countries that play a larger role in global textile production, such as China, Vietnam, Thailand, India and Bangladesh.

'''Reason''' is the capacity for [[Consciousness|consciously]] making sense of things, establishing and verifying [[fact]]s, applying [[logic]], and changing or justifying practices, [[institution]]s, and [[belief]]s based on new or existing [[information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/096725500750039282 | volume=8 | title=So We Need Something Else for Reason to Mean | year=2000 | journal=International Journal of Philosophical Studies | pages=271–295 | last1 = Kompridis | first1 = Nikolas}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely associated with such characteristically [[human]] activities as [[philosophy]], [[science]], [[language]], [[mathematics]], and [[art]] and is normally considered to be a distinguishing ability possessed by [[humans]].&lt;ref&gt;individuals, for example, "humans have reason."

Reason, or an aspect of it, is sometimes referred to as [[rationality]].

'''Reasoning''' is associated with [[Thought|thinking]], [[cognition]], and [[intellect]]. The philosophical field of [[logic]] studies ways in which humans reason [[Logical form|formal]]ly through [[argument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Hintikka|first=J.|title=Philosophy of logic|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/346240/philosophy-of-logic|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=12 November 2013|authorlink=Jaako Hintikka}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasoning may be subdivided into forms of [[logical reasoning]] (forms associated with the strict sense): [[deductive reasoning]], [[inductive reasoning]], [[abductive reasoning]]; and other modes of reasoning considered more informal, such as [[intuitive reasoning]] and [[verbal reasoning]].  Along these lines, a distinction is often drawn between logical, discursive  reasoning (reason proper), and [[Intuition (psychology)|intuitive reasoning]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.cua.edu/hoffmann/courses/102_1111/Aristotle_8_EN_6.pdf Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics 6 – The Intellectual Virtues]&lt;/ref&gt; in which the reasoning process through intuition—however valid—may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque.  In some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash, while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary rather than adversarial. For example, in [[mathematics]], intuition is often necessary for the creative processes involved with arriving at a [[formal proof]], arguably the most difficult of formal reasoning tasks.

Reasoning, like habit or intuition, is one of the ways by which thinking moves from one idea to a related idea. For example, reasoning is the means by which rational individuals understand sensory information from their environments, or conceptualize abstract dichotomies such as [[cause]] and [[Causality|effect]], [[truth]] and [[False (logic)|falsehood]], or ideas regarding notions of [[Good and evil|good or evil]]. Reasoning, as a part of executive decision making, is also closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change, in terms of [[goal]]s, [[belief]]s, [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[tradition]]s, and [[institution]]s, and therefore with the capacity for [[freedom]] and [[self-determination]]. &lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, "What is Enlightenment?" in ''The Essential Foucault'', eds. Paul Rabinow and Nikolas Rose, New York: The New Press, 2003, 43-57. See also Nikolas Kompridis, "The Idea of a New Beginning: A Romantic Source of Normativity and Freedom," in ''Philosophical Romanticism'', New York: Routledge, 2006, 32–59; [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/096725500750039282 "So We Need Something Else for Reason to Mean"], ''International Journal of Philosophical Studies'' 8: 3, 271–295.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In contrast to the use of "reason" as an [[Noun#Concrete nouns and abstract nouns|abstract noun]], [[Reason (argument)|a reason]] is a consideration given which either explains or justifies events, phenomena, or [[behavior]].&lt;ref name=mw&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reason Merriam-Webster.com] Merriam-Webster Dictionary definition of reason&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons justify decisions, reasons support explanations of natural phenomena; reasons can be given to explain the actions (conduct) of individuals.  

Using reason, or reasoning, can also be described more plainly as providing good, or the best, reasons. For example, when evaluating a moral decision, "morality is, at the very least, the effort to guide one's conduct by &lt;i&gt;reason&lt;/i&gt;—that is, doing what there are the best reasons for doing—while giving equal [and impartial] weight to the interests of all those affected by what one does."&lt;ref&gt; Rachels, James. The Elements of Moral Philosophy, 4th ed. McGraw Hill, 2002 &lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Psychology|Psychologists]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive scientists]] have attempted to study and explain [[psychology of reasoning|how people reason]], e.g. which cognitive and neural processes are engaged, and how cultural factors affect the inferences that people draw. The field of [[automated reasoning]] studies how reasoning may or may not be modeled computationally. [[comparative psychology|Animal psychology]] considers the question of whether animals other than humans can reason.

==Etymology and related words==
In the [[English language]] and other modern [[Languages of Europe|European languages]], "reason", and related words, represent words which have always been used to translate Latin and classical Greek terms in the sense of their philosophical usage.
*The original [[Greek language|Greek]] term was {{lang|grc|"λόγος"}} ''[[wikt:logos#Greek|logos]]'', the root of the modern English word "[[logic]]" but also a word which could mean for example "speech" or "explanation" or an "account" (of money handled).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=Henry George |last1=Liddell| first2=Robert |last2=Scott|title=A Greek–English Lexicon|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos|chapter=logos}}. For etymology of English "logic" see any dictionary such as [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/logic?show=0&amp;t=1296722456 the Merriam Webster entry for logic].&lt;/ref&gt;
*As a philosophical term ''logos'' was translated in its non-linguistic senses in [[Latin]] as ''[[wikt:ratio#Latin|ratio]]''. This was originally not just a translation used for philosophy, but was also commonly a translation for ''logos'' in the sense of an account of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dratio|chapter=ratio|first1=Charlton |last1=Lewis|first2= Charles |last2=Short|title=A Latin Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[French language|French]] ''[[wikt:raison|raison]]'' is derived directly from Latin, and this is the direct source of the English word "reason".&lt;ref name=mw/&gt;

The earliest major philosophers to publish in English, such as [[Francis Bacon]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], and [[John Locke]] also routinely wrote in Latin and French, and compared their terms to Greek, treating the words "''logos''", "''ratio''", "''raison''" and "reason" as interchangeable. The meaning of the word "reason" in senses such as "human reason" also overlaps to a large extent with "[[rationality]]" and the adjective of "reason" in philosophical contexts is normally "[[Rationality|rational]]", rather than "reasoned" or "reasonable".&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rational Merriam Webster "rational"] and [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reasonable Merriam Webster "reasonable"].&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers, [[Thomas Hobbes]] for example, also used the word ''ratiocination'' as a synonym for "reasoning".

==Philosophical history==
[[File:Goya Caprichos3.jpg|thumb|[[Francisco de Goya]], ''[[The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters]]'' (''El sueño de la razón produce monstruos''), c. 1797]]
The proposal that reason gives humanity a special position in nature has been argued to be a defining characteristic of western [[philosophy]] and later western [[History of science#Modern science|modern science]], starting with classical Greece. Philosophy can be described as a way of life based upon reason, and in the other direction reason has been one of the major subjects of philosophical discussion since ancient times. Reason is often said to be [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]], or "self-correcting", and the critique of reason has been a persistent theme in philosophy.&lt;ref name="Jürgen Habermas 1990"&gt;{{cite book |last=Habermas |first1=Jürgen |authorlink=Jürgen Habermas |title=The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=MIT Press |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been defined in different ways, at different times, by different thinkers about human nature.

===Classical philosophy===
For many classical [[philosophers]], nature was understood [[teleology|teleologically]], meaning that every type of thing had a definitive purpose which fit within a natural order that was itself understood to have aims. Perhaps starting with [[Pythagoras]] or [[Heraclitus]], the cosmos is even said to have reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Presocratic Philosophers|edition=second|last1=Kirk|last2=Raven|last3=Schofield|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1983}}. See pages 204 and 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Reason, by this account, is not just one characteristic that humans happen to have, and that influences happiness amongst other characteristics. Reason was considered of higher stature than other characteristics of human nature, such as sociability, because it is something humans share with nature itself, linking an apparently immortal part of the human mind with the divine order of the cosmos itself. Within the human [[mind]] or [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (''[[psyche (psychology)|psyche]]''), reason was described by [[Plato]] as being the natural monarch which should rule over the other parts, such as spiritedness (''[[thumos]]'') and the passions. [[Aristotle]], Plato's student, defined human beings as [[rational animal]]s, emphasizing reason as a characteristic of [[human nature]]. He ''defined'' the highest human happiness or well being (''[[eudaimonia]]'') as a life which is lived consistently, excellently and completely in accordance with reason.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' [[Nicomachean Ethics#Defining Happiness and the aim of the Ethics|Book 1]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The conclusions to be drawn from the discussions of Aristotle and Plato on this matter are amongst the most debated in the history of philosophy.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{Citation|title=Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on Intellect|last=Davidson|first=Herbert|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992}}, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; But teleological accounts such as Aristotle's were highly influential for those who attempt to explain reason in a way which is consistent with [[monotheism]] and the immortality and divinity of the human soul. For example, in the [[Neoplatonism|neo-platonist]] account of [[Plotinus]], the [[cosmos]] has one soul, which is the seat of all reason, and the souls of all individual humans are part of this soul. Reason is for Plotinus both the provider of form to material things, and the light which brings individuals souls back into line with their source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|chapter=Plotinus|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/plotinus/|last=Moore|first=Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such neo-Platonist accounts of the rational part of the human soul were standard amongst medieval Islamic philosophers, and under this influence, mainly via [[Averroes]], came to be debated seriously in Europe until well into the [[renaissance]], and they remain important in [[Iranian philosophy]].&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt;

===Subject-centred reason in early modern philosophy===

The [[early modern era]] was marked by a number of significant changes in the understanding of reason, starting in [[Europe]]. One of the most important of these changes involved a change in the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] understanding of human beings. Scientists and philosophers began to question the teleological understanding of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Hubert |last=Dreyfus |title=Telepistemology: Descartes' Last Stand |url=http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~hdreyfus/rtf/Limits_of_Telepresence_6_99.rtf |publisher= socrates.berkeley.edu |accessdate= February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nature was no longer assumed to be human-like, with its own aims or reason, and human nature was no longer assumed to work according to anything other than the same "[[natural law|laws of nature]]" which affect inanimate things. This new understanding eventually displaced the previous [[world view]] that derived from a spiritual understanding of the universe.
[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|200px|René Descartes]]
Accordingly, in the 17th century, [[René Descartes]] explicitly rejected the traditional notion of humans as "rational animals", suggesting instead that they are nothing more than "thinking things" along the lines of other "things" in nature. Any grounds of knowledge outside that understanding was, therefore, subject to doubt.

In his search for a foundation of all possible knowledge, Descartes deliberately decided to throw into doubt ''all'' knowledge – ''except'' that of the mind itself in the process of thinking:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At this time I admit nothing that is not necessarily true. I am therefore precisely nothing but a thinking thing; that is a mind, or intellect, or understanding, or reason – words of whose meanings I was previously ignorant.&lt;ref&gt;Descartes, "Second Meditation".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This eventually became known as [[epistemological]] or "subject-centred" reason, because it is based on the ''knowing subject'', who perceives the rest of the world and itself as a set of objects to be studied, and successfully mastered by applying the knowledge accumulated through such study. Breaking with tradition and many thinkers after him, Descartes explicitly did not divide the incorporeal soul into parts, such as reason and intellect, describing them as one indivisible incorporeal entity.

A contemporary of Descartes, [[Thomas Hobbes]] described reason as a broader version of "addition and subtraction" which is not limited to numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=De Corpore|url=https://archive.org/details/englishworkstho21hobbgoog|last=Hobbes|first=Thomas|editor-last=Molesworth}}: "We must not therefore think that computation, that is, ratiocination, has place only in numbers, as if man were distinguished from other living creatures (which is said to have been the opinion of ''[[Pythagoras]]'') by nothing but the faculty of numbering; for ''magnitude, body, motion, time, degrees of quality, action, conception, proportion, speech and names'' (in which all the kinds of philosophy consist) are capable of addition and substraction {{sic}}. Now such things as we add or substract, that is, which we put into an account, we are said to ''consider'', in Greek λογίζεσθαι [''logizesthai''], in which language also συλλογίζεσθι [''syllogizesthai''] signifies to ''compute'', ''reason'', or ''reckon''."&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding of reason is sometimes termed "calculative" reason. Similar to Descartes, Hobbes asserted that "No discourse whatsoever, can end in absolute knowledge of fact, past, or to come" but that "sense and memory" is absolute knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Thomas|last=Hobbes|title=The English Works of Thomas Hobbes|volume=3 (Leviathan) |chapter=VII. Of the ends, or resolutions of discourse|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=585&amp;chapter=89830&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27}} and {{citation|first=Thomas |last=Hobbes|title=The English Works of Thomas Hobbes|volume=3 (Leviathan)|chapter=IX.

In the late 17th century, through the 18th century, [[John Locke]] and [[David Hume]] developed Descartes' line of thought still further. Hume took it in an especially [[skepticism|skeptical]] direction, proposing that there could be no possibility of [[deductive reasoning|deducing]] relationships of cause and effect, and therefore no knowledge is based on reasoning alone, even if it seems otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=John|last=Locke|chapter=XXVII On Identity and Diversity|origyear=1689|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=761&amp;chapter=80770&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27|edition=12th|year=1824|title=An Essay concerning Human Understanding Part 1|publisher=Rivington|series =The Works of John Locke in Nine Volumes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David |last=Hume|chapter=I.IV.VI.

Hume famously remarked that, "We speak not strictly and philosophically when we talk of the combat of passion and of reason. Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David |last=Hume|chapter=II.III.III. Of the influencing motives of the will.|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=342&amp;search=%22slave%22&amp;chapter=55191&amp;layout=html#a_607782|title=A Treatise of Human Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume also took his definition of reason to unorthodox extremes by arguing, unlike his predecessors, that human reason is not qualitatively different from either simply conceiving individual ideas, or from judgments associating two ideas,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David |last=Hume|chapter=I.III.VII (footnote) Of the Nature of the Idea Or Belief|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=342&amp;chapter=55095&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27#lf0213_footnote_nt018|title=A Treatise of Human Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "reason is nothing but a wonderful and unintelligible instinct in our souls, which carries us along a certain train of ideas, and endows them with particular qualities, according to their particular situations and relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David |last=Hume|chapter=I.III.XVI. Of the reason of animals|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=342&amp;chapter=55113&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27|title=A Treatise of Human Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; It followed from this that animals have reason, only much less complex than human reason.

In the 18th century, [[Immanuel Kant]] attempted to show that Hume was wrong by demonstrating that a "[[transcendental arguments|transcendental]]" self, or "I", was a necessary condition of all experience. Therefore, suggested Kant, on the basis of such a self, it is in fact possible to reason both about the conditions and limits of human knowledge. And so long as these limits are respected, reason can be the vehicle of morality, justice, aesthetics, theories of knowledge ([[epistemology]]), and understanding.

===Substantive and formal reason===

In the formulation of Kant, who wrote some of the most influential modern treatises on the subject, the great achievement of reason ({{lang-de|Vernunft}}) is that it is able to exercise a kind of universal law-making. Kant was able therefore to reformulate the basis of moral-practical, theoretical and aesthetic reasoning, on "universal" laws.

Here [[practical reason]]ing is the self-legislating or self-governing formulation of universal [[norm (philosophy)|norm]]s, and [[theory|theoretical]] reasoning the way humans posit universal [[natural law|laws of nature]].&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Critique of Pure Reason''; ''Critique of Practical Reason''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under practical reason, the moral [[autonomy]] or freedom of human beings depends on their ability to behave according to laws that are given to them by the proper exercise of that reason. This contrasted with earlier forms of morality, which depended on [[religion|religious understanding]] and interpretation, or [[nature]] for their substance.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sandel, ''Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?'', New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kant, in a free society each individual must be able to pursue their goals however they see fit, so long as their actions conform to principles given by reason. He formulated such a principle, called the "[[categorical imperative]]", which would justify an action only if it could be universalized:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.&lt;ref name="Ellington"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kant|first1=Immanuel|authorlink=Immanuel Kant|author2=translated by James W. Ellington [1785]|title=Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals 3rd ed.|publisher=Hackett|year=1993|page=30|isbn=0-87220-166-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast to Hume then, Kant insists that reason itself (German ''[[wikt:Vernunft|Vernunft]]'') has natural ends itself, the solution to the metaphysical problems, especially the discovery of the foundations of morality. Kant claimed that this problem could be solved with his "[[transcendental logic]]" which unlike normal logic is not just an instrument, which can be used indifferently, as it was for Aristotle, but a theoretical science in its own right and the basis of all the others.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Citation|last=Velkley|first=Richard|year=2002| chapter=On Kant's Socratism|title=Being After Rousseau|publisher=University of Chicago Press}} and Kant's own first preface to ''[[The Critique of Pure Reason]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jürgen Habermas]], the "substantive unity" of reason has dissolved in modern times, such that it can no longer answer the question "How should I live?" Instead, the unity of reason has to be strictly formal, or "procedural." He thus described reason as a group of three autonomous spheres (on the model of Kant's three critiques):

#'''Cognitive–instrumental reason''' is the kind of reason employed by the sciences. It is used to observe events, to predict and control outcomes, and to intervene in the world on the basis of its hypotheses;
#'''Moral–practical reason''' is what we use to deliberate and discuss issues in the moral and political realm, according to universalizable procedures (similar to Kant's categorical imperative); and
#'''Aesthetic reason''' is typically found in works of art and literature, and encompasses the novel ways of seeing the world and interpreting things that those practices embody.

For Habermas, these three spheres are the domain of experts, and therefore need to be mediated with the "[[lifeworld]]" by philosophers. In drawing such a picture of reason, Habermas hoped to demonstrate that the substantive unity of reason, which in pre-modern societies had been able to answer questions about the good life, could be made up for by the unity of reason's formalizable procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The critique of reason===

[[Johann Georg Hamann|Hamann]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Richard Rorty|Rorty]], and many other philosophers have contributed to a debate about what reason means, or ought to mean. Some, like Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Rorty, are skeptical about subject-centred, universal, or instrumental reason, and even skeptical toward reason as a whole. Others, including Hegel, believe that it has obscured the importance of [[intersubjectivity]], or "spirit" in human life, and attempt to reconstruct a model of what reason should be.

Some thinkers, e.g. Foucault, believe there are other ''forms'' of reason, neglected but essential to modern life, and to our understanding of what it means to live a life according to reason.&lt;ref name="Jürgen Habermas 1990"/&gt;

In the last several decades, a number of proposals have been made to "re-orient" this critique of reason, or to recognize the "other voices" or "new departments" of reason:

For example, in opposition to subject-centred reason, Habermas has proposed a model of [[communicative rationality|communicative reason]] that sees it as an essentially cooperative activity, based on the fact of linguistic [[intersubjectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''The Theory of Communicative Action: Reason and the Rationalization of Society'', translated by Thomas McCarthy. Boston: Beacon Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikolas Kompridis]] has proposed a widely encompassing view of reason as "that ensemble of practices that contributes to the opening and preserving of openness" in human affairs, and a focus on reason's possibilities for social change.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Kompridis, ''Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2006. See also Nikolas Kompridis, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/096725500750039282 "So We Need Something Else for Reason to Mean"], ''International Journal of Philosophical Studies'' 8:3, 271–295.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], influenced by the 20th century German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]], has proposed that reason ought to include the faculty of [[world disclosure|disclosure]], which is tied to the way we make sense of things in everyday life, as a new "department" of reason.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taylor, ''Philosophical Arguments'' (Harvard University Press, 1997), 12; 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the essay "What is Enlightenment?", Michel Foucault proposed a concept of critique based on Kant's distinction between "private" and "public" uses of reason. This distinction, as suggested, has two dimensions:

*'''Private reason''' is the reason that is used when an individual is "a cog in a machine" or when one "has a role to play in society and jobs to do: to be a soldier, to have taxes to pay, to be in charge of a parish, to be a civil servant."
*'''Public reason''' is the reason used "when one is reasoning as a reasonable being (and not as a cog in a machine), when one is reasoning as a member of reasonable humanity." In these circumstances, "the use of reason must be free and public."&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, "What is Enlightenment?", ''The Essential Foucault'', New York: The New Press, 2003, 43–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reason compared to related concepts==

===Compared to logic===
{{Main article|Logic}}
The terms "logic" or "logical" are sometimes used as if they were identical with the term "reason" or with the concept of being "rational", or sometimes logic is seen as the most pure or the defining form of reason. For example in modern [[economics]], [[Rational choice theory|rational choice]] is assumed to equate to logically [[Consistency|consistent]] choice.

Reason and logic can however be thought of as distinct, although logic is one important aspect of reason. Author [[Douglas Hofstadter]], in ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', characterizes the distinction in this way. Logic is done inside a system while reason is done outside the system by such methods as skipping steps, working backward, drawing diagrams, looking at examples, or seeing what happens if you change the rules of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Hofstadter, ''Gödel, Escher, Bach'', Vintage, 1979, {{ISBN|0-394-74502-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reason is a type of [[thought]], and the word "[[logic]]" involves the attempt to describe rules or norms by which reasoning operates, so that orderly reasoning can be taught. The oldest surviving writing to explicitly consider the rules by which reason operates are the works of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Aristotle]], especially ''Prior Analysis'' and ''Posterior Analysis''.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Complete Works'' (2 volumes), Princeton, 1995, {{ISBN|0-691-09950-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Ancient Greeks had no separate word for logic as distinct from language and reason, Aristotle's [[neologism|newly coined word]] "[[syllogism]]" (''syllogismos'') identified logic clearly for the first time as a distinct field of study. When Aristotle referred to "the logical" (''hē logikē''), he was referring more broadly to rational thought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/searchresults?all_words=logiko/s&amp;all_words_expand=yes&amp;la=greek See this Perseus search, and compare English translations.] and see [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph.jsp?l=logikw%3Ds&amp;la=greek&amp;prior=le/getai&amp;d=Perseus:text:1999.01.0049:book=1:section=1217b&amp;i=1#lexicon LSJ dictionary entry for λογικός, section II.2.b.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reason compared to cause-and-effect thinking, and symbolic thinking===
{{Main article|Causality|Symbols}}
As pointed out by philosophers such as Hobbes, Locke and Hume, some animals are also clearly capable of a type of "[[association (psychology)|associative thinking]]", even to the extent of associating causes and effects. A dog once kicked, can learn how to recognize the warning signs and avoid being kicked in the future, but this does not mean the dog has reason in any strict sense of the word. It also does not mean that humans acting on the basis of experience or habit are using their reason.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Treatise of Human Nature]] of [[David Hume]], [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=342&amp;chapter=55113&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 Book I, Part III, Sect. XVI].&lt;/ref&gt;

Human reason requires more than being able to associate two ideas, even if those two ideas might be described by a reasoning human as a cause and an effect, perceptions of smoke, for example, and memories of fire. For reason to be involved, the association of smoke and the fire would have to be thought through in a way which can be explained, for example as cause and effect. In the explanation of [[John Locke|Locke]], for example, reason requires the mental use of a third idea in order to make this comparison by use of [[syllogism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=John|last=Locke|volume= 2|chapter=XVII Of Reason|origyear=1689|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=762&amp;layout=html#chapter_80842|edition=12th|year=1824|publisher=Rivington|series =The Works of John Locke in Nine Volumes|title=An Essay concerning Human Understanding Part 2 and Other Writings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, reason in the strict sense requires the ability to create and manipulate a system of [[symbol]]s, as well as [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#II. Icon, index, symbol|indices and icons]], according to [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], the symbols having only a nominal, though habitual, connection to either smoke or fire.&lt;ref&gt;Terrence Deacon, ''The Symbolic Species: The Co-Evolution of Language and the Brain'', W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1998, {{ISBN|0-393-31754-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of such a system of artificial symbols and signs is [[language]].

The connection of reason to symbolic thinking has been expressed in different ways by philosophers. [[Thomas Hobbes]] described the creation of "Markes, or Notes of remembrance" (''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' Ch.4) as ''speech''. He used the word ''speech'' as an English version of the Greek word ''[[logos]]'' so that speech did not need to be communicated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-a.html#CHAPTERIV Leviathan Chapter IV] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615025735/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-a.html |date=2006-06-15 }}: "The Greeks have but one word, logos, for both speech and reason; not that they thought there was no speech without reason, but no reasoning without speech"&lt;/ref&gt; When communicated, such speech becomes language, and the marks or notes or remembrance are called "[[Sign (linguistics)|Signes]]" by Hobbes. Going further back, although Aristotle is a source of the idea that only humans have reason (''logos''), he does mention that animals with imagination, for whom sense perceptions can persist, come closest to having something like reasoning and ''[[nous]]'', and even uses the word "logos" in one place to describe the distinctions which animals can perceive in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' II.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reason, imagination, mimesis, and memory===
{{Main article|Imagination|Mimesis|Memory|Recollection}}
Reason and [[imagination]] rely on similar [[mental processes]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]] (2005). ''The Rational Imagination: How People Create Counterfactual Alternatives to Reality.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Imagination is not only found in humans. Aristotle, for example, stated that ''phantasia'' (imagination: that which can hold images or ''phantasmata'') and ''phronein'' (a type of thinking that can judge and understand in some sense) also exist in some animals.&lt;ref&gt;''[[De Anima]]'' III.i–iii; ''On Memory and Recollection'', ''On Dreams''&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, both are related to the primary perceptive ability of animals, which gathers the perceptions of different senses and defines the order of the things that are perceived without distinguishing universals, and without deliberation or ''logos''. But this is not yet reason, because human imagination is different.

The recent modern writings of [[Terrence Deacon]] and [[Merlin Donald]], writing about the [[origin of language]], also connect reason connected to not only [[language]], but also [[mimesis]],&lt;ref&gt;Mimesis in modern academic writing, starting with [[Erich Auerbach]], is a technical word, which is not necessarily exactly the same in meaning as the original Greek. See [[Mimesis]].&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically they describe the ability to create [[language]] as part of an internal modeling of [[reality]] specific to humankind. Other results are [[consciousness]], and [[imagination]] or [[fantasy]]. In contrast, modern proponents of a genetic predisposition to language itself include [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Steven Pinker]], to whom Donald and Deacon can be contrasted.

As reason is symbolic thinking, and peculiarly human, then this implies that humans have a special ability to maintain a clear consciousness of the distinctness of "icons" or images and the real things they represent. Starting with a modern author, Merlin Donald writes&lt;ref&gt;Origins of the Modern Mind p.172&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A dog might perceive the "meaning" of a fight that was realistically play-acted by humans, but it could not reconstruct the message or distinguish the representation from its referent (a real fight). [...] Trained apes are able to make this distinction; young children make this distinction early – hence, their effortless distinction between play-acting an event and the event itself&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In classical descriptions, an equivalent description of this mental faculty is ''eikasia'', in the philosophy of Plato.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Klein ''A Commentary on the [[Meno]]'' Ch.5&lt;/ref&gt; This is the ability to perceive whether a perception is an image of something else, related somehow but not the same, and therefore allows humans to perceive that a dream or memory or a reflection in a mirror is not reality as such. What Klein refers to as ''dianoetic eikasia'' is the ''eikasia'' concerned specifically with thinking and mental images, such as those mental symbols, icons, ''signes'', and marks discussed above as definitive of reason. Explaining reason from this direction: human thinking is special in the way that we often understand visible things as if they were themselves images of our intelligible "objects of thought" as "foundations" (''hypothēses'' in Ancient Greek). This thinking (''dianoia'') is "...an activity which consists in making the vast and diffuse jungle of the visible world depend on a plurality of more 'precise' ''noēta''."&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Klein ''A Commentary on the Meno'' p.122&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Merlin Donald and the Socratic authors such as Plato and Aristotle emphasize the importance of ''mimesis'', often translated as ''imitation'' or ''representation''. Donald writes&lt;ref&gt;Origins of the Modern Mind p.169&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Imitation is found especially in monkeys and apes [... but ...] Mimesis is fundamentally different from imitation and mimicry in that it involves the invention of intentional representations. [...] Mimesis is not absolutely tied to external communication.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Mimēsis'' is a concept, now popular again in academic discussion, that was particularly prevalent in Plato's works, and within Aristotle, it is discussed mainly in the ''Poetics''. In Michael Davis's account of the theory of man in this work.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction" to the translation of ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' by Davis and [[Seth Benardete]] p. xvii, xxviii&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the distinctive feature of human action, that whenever we choose what we do, we imagine an action for ourselves as though we were inspecting it from the outside. Intentions are nothing more than imagined actions, internalizings of the external. All action is therefore imitation of action; it is poetic...&lt;ref&gt;Davis is here using "poetic" in an unusual sense, questioning the contrast in Aristotle between action (''praxis'', the ''praktikē'') and making (''poēsis'', the ''poētikē''): "Human [peculiarly human] action is imitation of action because thinking is always rethinking. Aristotle can define human beings as at once rational animals, political animals, and imitative animals because in the end the three are the same."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Donald like Plato (and Aristotle, especially in ''On Memory and Recollection''), emphasizes the peculiarity in humans of voluntary initiation of a search through one's mental world. The ancient Greek ''anamnēsis'', normally translated as "recollection" was opposed to ''mneme'' or ''memory''. Memory, shared with some animals,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle [[On Memory]] 450a 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; requires a consciousness not only of what happened in the past, but also ''that'' something happened in the past, which is in other words a kind of ''eikasia''&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Klein ''A Commentary on the Meno'' p.109&lt;/ref&gt; "...but nothing except man is able to recollect."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle Hist. Anim. I.1.488b.25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Recollection is a deliberate effort to search for and recapture something once known. Klein writes that, "To become aware of our having forgotten something means to begin recollecting."&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Klein ''A Commentary on the Meno'' p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Donald calls the same thing ''autocueing'', which he explains as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''The Origins of the Modern Mind'' p.173 see also ''A Mind So Rare'' p.140–141&lt;/ref&gt; "Mimetic acts are reproducible on the basis of internal, self-generated cues. This permits voluntary recall of mimetic representations, without the aid of external cues – probably the earliest form of representational ''thinking''."

In a celebrated paper in modern times, the fantasy author and philologist [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote in his essay "On Fairy Stories" that the terms "fantasy" and "enchantment" are connected to not only "....the satisfaction of certain primordial human desires...." but also "...the origin of language and of the mind."

===Logical reasoning methods and argumentation===
Looking at logical categorizations of different types of reasoning the traditional main division made in philosophy is between [[deductive reasoning]] and [[inductive reasoning]]. [[Logic|Formal logic]] has been described as ''the science of deduction''.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey, Richard. 1991. ''Formal logic: its scope and limits'', (3rd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill:1.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of inductive reasoning is generally carried out within the field known as [[informal logic]] or [[critical thinking]].

====Deductive reasoning====
{{Main article|Deductive reasoning}}
A subdivision of [[Philosophy]] is [[Logic]].  Logic is the study of reasoning.  Deduction is a form of reasoning in which a conclusion follows necessarily from the stated premises. A deduction is also the conclusion reached by a deductive reasoning process.  One classic example of deductive reasoning is that found in [[syllogism]]s like the following:

*Premise 1: All humans are mortal.
*Premise 2: Socrates is a human.
*Conclusion: Socrates is mortal.

The reasoning in this argument is valid, because there is no way in which the premises, 1 and 2, could be true and the conclusion, 3, be false.

====Inductive reasoning====
{{Main article|Inductive reasoning}}
Induction is a form of inference producing propositions about unobserved objects or types, either specifically or generally, based on previous observation. It is used to ascribe [[category of being|properties or relations]] to objects or [[type (metaphysics)|types]] based on [[event (philosophy)|previous observations or experiences]], or to formulate general statements or [[law (principle)|law]]s based on limited observations of recurring [[phenomena]]l patterns.

Inductive reasoning contrasts strongly with deductive reasoning in that, even in the best, or strongest, cases of inductive reasoning, the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Instead, the conclusion of an inductive argument follows with some degree of [[probability]]. Relatedly, the conclusion of an inductive argument contains more information than is already contained in the premises. Thus, this method of reasoning is ampliative.

A classic example of inductive reasoning comes from the [[empiricist]] [[David Hume]]:
*Premise: The sun has risen in the east every morning up until now.
*Conclusion: The sun will also rise in the east tomorrow.

====Abductive reasoning====
{{Main article|Abductive reasoning}}
Abductive reasoning, or argument to the best explanation, is a form of inductive reasoning, since the conclusion in an abductive argument does not follow with certainty from its premises and concerns something unobserved. What distinguishes abduction from the other forms of reasoning is an attempt to favour one conclusion above others, by attempting to falsify alternative explanations or by demonstrating the likelihood of the favoured conclusion, given a set of more or less disputable assumptions. For example, when a patient displays certain symptoms, there might be various possible causes, but one of these is preferred above others as being more probable.

====Analogical reasoning====
{{Main article|Analogical reasoning}}
Analogical reasoning is reasoning from the particular to the particular. It is often used in [[case-based reasoning]], especially legal reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Walton |first=Douglas N. |authorlink=Doug Walton |date=2014 |chapter=Argumentation schemes for argument from analogy |editor-last=Ribeiro |editor-first=Henrique Jales |title=Systematic approaches to argument by analogy |series=Argumentation library |volume=25 |location=Cham; New York |publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] |pages=23–40 |isbn=9783319063331 |oclc=884441074 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-06334-8_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example follows:

*Premise 1: Socrates is human and mortal.
*Premise 2: Plato is human.
*Conclusion: Plato is mortal.

Analogical reasoning can be viewed as a form of inductive reasoning from a single example, but if it is intended as inductive reasoning it is a bad example, because inductive reasoning typically uses a large number of examples to reason from the particular to the general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Vickers |first=John |title=The Problem of Induction |work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |year=2009 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Analogical reasoning often leads to wrong conclusions. For example:

*Premise 1: Socrates is human and male.
*Premise 2: [[Ada Lovelace]] is human.
*Conclusion: Therefore Ada Lovelace is male.

====Fallacious reasoning====
{{Main article|Fallacy|Formal fallacy|Informal fallacy}}
Flawed reasoning in arguments is known as [[fallacy|fallacious reasoning]]. Bad reasoning within arguments can be because it commits either a [[formal fallacy]] or an [[informal fallacy]].

Formal fallacies occur when there is a problem with the form, or structure, of the argument. The word "formal" refers to this link to the ''form'' of the argument. An argument that contains a formal fallacy will always be invalid.

An informal fallacy is an error in reasoning that occurs due to a problem with the ''content'', rather than mere ''structure'', of the argument.

==Traditional problems raised concerning reason==
Philosophy is sometimes described as a life of reason, with normal human reason pursued in a more consistent and dedicated way than usual. Two categories of problem concerning reason have long been discussed by philosophers concerning reason, essentially being reasonings about reasoning itself as a human aim, or philosophizing about philosophizing. The first question is concerning whether we can be confident that reason can achieve [[knowledge]] of [[truth]] better than other ways of trying to achieve such knowledge. The other question is whether a life of reason, a life that aims to be guided by reason, can be expected to achieve a [[eudaimonia|happy life]] more so than other ways of life (whether such a life of reason results in knowledge or not).

===Reason versus truth, and "first principles"===
{{See also|Truth|First principle|Nous}}
Since [[classical antiquity|classical]] times a question has remained constant in philosophical debate (which is sometimes seen as a conflict between movements called [[Platonism]] and [[Aristotelianism]]) concerning the role of reason in confirming [[truth]]. People use logic, [[deductive reasoning|deduction]], and [[inductive reasoning|induction]], to reach conclusions they think are true. Conclusions reached in this way are considered, according to Aristotle, more certain than sense perceptions on their own.&lt;ref&gt;Example: Aristotle ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D981b 981b]: τὴν ὀνομαζομένην σοφίαν περὶ τὰ πρῶτα αἴτια καὶ τὰς ἀρχὰς ὑπολαμβάνουσι πάντες: ὥστε, καθάπερ εἴρηται πρότερον, ὁ μὲν ἔμπειρος τῶν ὁποιανοῦν ἐχόντων αἴσθησιν εἶναι δοκεῖ σοφώτερος, ὁ δὲ τεχνίτης τῶν ἐμπείρων, χειροτέχνου δὲ ἀρχιτέκτων, αἱ δὲ θεωρητικαὶ τῶν ποιητικῶν μᾶλλον. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D981b English]: "...what is called Wisdom is concerned with the primary causes and principles, so that, as has been already stated, the man of experience is held to be wiser than the mere possessors of any power of sensation, the artist than the man of experience, the master craftsman than the artisan; and the speculative sciences to be more learned than the productive."&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, if such reasoned conclusions are only built originally upon a foundation of sense perceptions, then, our most logical conclusions can never be said to be certain because they are built upon the very same fallible perceptions they seek to better.&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D1009b 1009b] ποῖα οὖν τούτων ἀληθῆ ἢ ψευδῆ, ἄδηλον: οὐθὲν γὰρ μᾶλλον τάδε ἢ τάδε ἀληθῆ, ἀλλ᾽ ὁμοίως. διὸ Δημόκριτός γέ φησιν ἤτοι οὐθὲν εἶναι ἀληθὲς ἢ ἡμῖν γ᾽ ἄδηλον. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D1009b English] "Thus it is uncertain which of these impressions are true or false; for one kind is no more true than another, but equally so. And hence Democritus says that either there is no truth or we cannot discover it."&lt;/ref&gt;

This leads to the question of what types of [[first principles]], or starting points of reasoning, are available for someone seeking to come to true conclusions. In Greek, "[[first principles]]" are ''[[Arche|archai]]'', "starting points",&lt;ref&gt;For example Aristotle ''Metaphysics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D983a 983a]: ἐπεὶ δὲ φανερὸν ὅτι τῶν ἐξ '''ἀρχῆς''' αἰτίων δεῖ λαβεῖν '''ἐπιστήμην''' （τότε γὰρ εἰδέναι φαμὲν ἕκαστον, ὅταν τὴν '''πρώτην''' αἰτίαν οἰώμεθα '''γνωρίζειν'''） [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D983a English] "It is clear that we must obtain knowledge of the '''primary''' causes, because it is when we think that we understand its '''primary''' cause that we claim to '''know''' each particular thing."&lt;/ref&gt; and the faculty used to perceive them is sometimes referred to in Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;Example: ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0053%3Abekker+page%3D1139a 1139b]: ἀμφοτέρων δὴ τῶν '''νοητικῶν''' μορίων ἀλήθεια τὸ ἔργον. καθ᾽ ἃς οὖν μάλιστα ἕξεις ἀληθεύσει ἑκάτερον, αὗται ἀρεταὶ ἀμφοῖν. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1139a English] The attainment of truth is then the function of both the '''intellectual''' parts of the soul. Therefore their respective virtues are those dispositions that will best qualify them to attain truth.&lt;/ref&gt; and Plato&lt;ref&gt;Example: Plato ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0167%3Abook%3D6%3Asection%3D490b 490b]: μιγεὶς τῷ ὄντι ὄντως, γεννήσας νοῦν καὶ ἀλήθειαν, γνοίη [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0094%3Abook%3D6%3Asection%3D490b English]: "Consorting with reality really, he would beget intelligence and truth, attain to knowledge"&lt;/ref&gt; as ''[[nous]]'' which was close in meaning to ''awareness'' or ''[[consciousness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"This quest for the beginnings proceeds through sense perception, reasoning, and what they call ''noesis'', which is literally translated by "understanding" or intellect," and which we can perhaps translate a little bit more cautiously by "awareness," an awareness of the mind's eye as distinguished from sensible awareness." "Progress or Return" in An Introduction to Political Philosophy: Ten Essays by Leo Strauss. (Expanded version of Political Philosophy: Six Essays by Leo Strauss, 1975.) Ed. Hilail Gilden. Detroit: Wayne State UP, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Empiricism]] (sometimes associated with Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;However, the empiricism of Aristotle must certainly be doubted. For example in ''Metaphysics'' 1009b, cited above, he criticizes people who think knowledge might not be possible because, "They say that the impression given through sense-perception is necessarily true; for it is on these grounds that both [[Empedocles]] and Democritus and practically all the rest have become obsessed by such opinions as these."&lt;/ref&gt; but more correctly associated with [[Great Britain|British]] philosophers such as [[John Locke]] and [[David Hume]], as well as their ancient equivalents such as [[Democritus]]) asserts that sensory impressions are the only available starting points for reasoning and attempting to attain truth. This approach always leads to the controversial conclusion that [[absolute knowledge]] is not attainable. [[Idealism]], (associated with Plato and his school), claims that there is a "higher" reality, from which certain people can directly arrive at truth without needing to rely only upon the senses, and that this higher reality is therefore the primary source of truth.

Philosophers such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], [[Averroes]], [[Maimonides]], [[Aquinas]] and [[Hegel]] are sometimes said to have argued that reason must be fixed and discoverable—perhaps by dialectic, analysis, or study. In the vision of these thinkers, reason is divine or at least has divine attributes. Such an approach allowed religious philosophers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Étienne Gilson]] to try to show that reason and [[revelation]] are compatible. According to Hegel, "...the only thought which Philosophy brings with it to the contemplation of [[History]], is the simple conception of reason; that reason is the Sovereign of the World; that the history of the world, therefore, presents us with a rational process."&lt;ref&gt;G.W.F. Hegel [[Lectures on the Philosophy of History|''The Philosophy of History'']], p. 9, Dover Publications Inc., {{ISBN|0-486-20112-0}}; 1st ed. 1899&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 17th century [[rationalist]]s, reason has often been taken to be a [[subjectivity|subjective faculty]], or rather the unaided ability ([[pure reason]]) to form concepts.  For [[Descartes]], [[Spinoza]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], this was associated with [[mathematics]]. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] attempted to show that pure reason could form concepts ([[time]] and [[space]]) that are the conditions of experience. Kant made his argument in opposition to Hume, who denied that reason had any role to play in experience.

===Reason versus emotion or passion===
{{See also|Emotion|Passion (emotion)}}
After Plato and Aristotle,  [[western literature]] often treated reason as being the faculty that trained the passions and appetites.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} [[Stoic philosophy]] by contrast considered all passions undesirable.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} After the critiques of reason in the early Enlightenment the appetites were rarely discussed or conflated with the passions.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Some Enlightenment camps took after the Stoics to say Reason should oppose Passion rather than order it, while others like the Romantics believed that Passion displaces Reason, as in the maxim "follow your heart".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Reason has been seen as a slave, or judge, of the passions, notably  in the work of [[David Hume]], and more recently  of [[Freud]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Reasoning which claims that the object of a desire is demanded by logic alone is called ''[[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

[[Rousseau]] first proposed, in his second ''[[Discourse on Inequality|Discourse]]'', that reason and political life is not natural and possibly harmful to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Velkley|first=Richard|chapter=Speech. Imagination, Origins: Rousseau and the Political Animal|title=Being after Rousseau: Philosophy and Culture in Question|year=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asked what really can be said about what is natural to mankind. What, other than reason and civil society, "best suits his constitution"? Rousseau saw "two principles prior to reason" in human nature. First we hold an intense interest in our own well-being. Secondly we object to the suffering or death of any sentient being, especially one like ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rousseau|chapter=Preface|title=Discourse on the Origin and Foundations of Inequality Among Men or Second Discourse|publisher=Cambridge University Press|editor=Gourevitch|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two passions lead us to desire more than we could achieve. We become dependent upon each other, and on relationships of authority and obedience. This effectively puts the human race into slavery. Rousseau says that he almost dares to assert that nature does not destine men to be healthy. According to Velkley, "Rousseau outlines certain programs of rational self-correction, most notably the political legislation of the ''[[The Social Contract|Contrat Social]]'' and the moral education in ''[[Emile: or, On Education|Émile]]''. All the same, Rousseau understands such corrections to be only ameliorations of an essentially unsatisfactory condition, that of socially and intellectually corrupted humanity."

This quandary presented by Rousseau led to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s new way of justifying reason as freedom to create good and evil. These therefore are not to be blamed on nature or God. In various ways,  [[German Idealism]] after Kant, and major later figures such [[Nietzsche]], [[Bergson]], [[Husserl]], [[Max Scheler|Scheler]], and [[Heidegger]], remain preoccupied with problems coming from the metaphysical demands or ''urges'' of ''reason''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Velkley|first=Richard|chapter=Freedom, Teleology, and Justification of Reason|title=Being after Rousseau: Philosophy and Culture in Question|year=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of Rousseau and these later writers is also large upon art and politics. Many writers (such as [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]) extol passion and disparage reason. In politics modern [[nationalism]] comes from Rousseau's argument that rationalist [[cosmopolitanism]] brings man ever further from his natural state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|chapter=Rousseau and the Origins of Nationalism|last=Plattner|first=Marc|year=1997|publisher=University of Chicago Press|title=The Legacy of Rousseau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view on reason and emotion was proposed in the 1994 book titled ''[[Descartes' Error]]'' by [[Antonio Damasio]]. In it, Damasio presents the "[[Somatic marker hypothesis|Somatic Marker Hypothesis]]" which states that emotions guide behavior and decision-making. Damasio argues that these somatic markers (known collectively as "gut feelings") are "intuitive signals" that direct our decision making processes in a certain way that cannot be solved with rationality alone. Damasio further argues that rationality requires emotional input in order to function.

===Reason versus faith or tradition===
{{Main article|Faith|Religion|Tradition}}
There are many religious traditions, some of which are explicitly [[Fideism|fideist]] and others of which claim varying degrees of [[rationalism]]. Secular critics sometimes accuse all religious adherents of irrationality, since they claim such adherents are guilty of ignoring, suppressing, or forbidding some kinds of reasoning concerning some subjects (such as religious dogmas, moral taboos, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/God-Delusion-Richard-Dawkins/dp/0618918248/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459966578&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=god+delusion|title=The God Delusion|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|date=2008-01-16|publisher=Mariner Books|isbn=9780618918249|edition=Reprint|language=English|quote="Scientists... see the fight for evolution as only one battle in a larger war: a looming war between supernaturalism on the one side and rationality on the other. "}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the [[theology|theologies]] and [[religion]]s such as [[Monotheism|classical monotheism]] typically do not claim to be [[irrationality|irrational]], there is often a perceived conflict or tension between [[faith]] and [[tradition]] on the one hand, and reason on the other, as potentially competing sources of [[wisdom]], [[law]] and [[truth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Strauss|title=An Introduction to Political Philosophy|chapter=Progress or Return|first=Leo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=John|last=Locke|volume= 2|issue=An Essay concerning Human Understanding Part 2 and Other Writings |chapter=XVIII Of Faith and Reason, and their distinct Provinces.|origyear=1689|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=762&amp;layout=html#chapter_80844|edition=12th|year=1824|publisher=Rivington|series =The Works of John Locke in Nine Volumes|title=An Essay concerning Human Understanding Part 2 and Other Writings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious adherents sometimes respond by arguing that faith and reason can be reconciled, or have different non-overlapping domains, or that critics engage in a similar kind of irrationalism: 
* '''Reconciliation:''' Philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]] argues that there is no real conflict between reason and classical theism because classical theism explains (among other things) why the universe is intelligible and why reason can successfully grasp it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Where-Conflict-Really-Lies-Naturalism/dp/0199812098/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459964688&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=where+the+conflict+really+lies|title=Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, and Naturalism|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|date=2011-12-09|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199812097|edition=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Signs-Knowledge-God-Arguments/dp/0199661073/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459966642&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=stephen+evans+signs|title=Natural Signs and Knowledge of God: A New Look at Theistic Arguments|date=2012-12-15|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199661077|edition=Reprint|location=Oxford|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Non-overlapping magisteria:''' Evolutionary biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] argues that there need not be conflict between reason and religious belief because they are each authoritative in their own domain (or "magisterium").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html|title=Stephen Jay Gould, "Nonoverlapping Magisteria," 1997|website=www.stephenjaygould.org|access-date=2016-04-06|quote="To say it for all my colleagues and for the umpteenth millionth time (from college bull sessions to learned treatises): science simply cannot (by its legitimate methods) adjudicate the issue of God's possible superintendence of nature.

God could clinch the matter in his favour at any moment by staging a spectacular demonstration of his powers, one that would satisfy the exacting standards of science. Even the infamous Templeton Foundation recognized that God is a scientific hypothesis — by funding double-blind trials to test whether remote prayer would speed the recovery of heart patients. It didn't, of course, although a control group who knew they had been prayed for tended to get worse (how about a class action suit against the Templeton Foundation?)

*'''Unification:''' Theologian Joseph Ratzinger, later [[Benedict XVI]], asserted that "Christianity has understood itself as the religion of the Logos, as the religion according to reason," referring to John 1:Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος, usually translated as "In the beginning was the Word (Logos)." Thus, he said that the Christian faith is "open to all that is truly rational", and that the rationality of Western Enlightenment "is of Christian origin".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/catholic-contributions/cardinal-ratzinger-on-europe-s-crisis-of-culture.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Some commentators have claimed that [[Western culture|Western civilization]] can be almost defined by its serious testing of the limits of tension between "unaided" reason and [[faith]] in "[[revelation|revealed]]" truths—figuratively summarized as [[Athens]] and [[Jerusalem]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/When-Athens-Met-Jerusalem-Introduction/dp/0830829237/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459965696&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=athens+and+jerusalem|title=When Athens Met Jerusalem: An Introduction to Classical and Christian Thought|date=2009-05-21|publisher=IVP Academic|isbn=9780830829231|edition=58760th|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Athens-Jerusalem-Lev-Shestov/dp/B0007FM164/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459965696&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=athens+and+jerusalem|title=Athens and Jerusalem|last=Shestov|first=Lev|date=1968|publisher=Simon and Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo Strauss]] spoke of a "Greater [[Western world|West]]" that included all areas under the influence of the tension between Greek rationalism and [[Abrahamic]] revelation, including the [[Muslim]] lands. He was particularly influenced by the great [[Islamic philosophy|Muslim philosopher]] [[Farabi|Al-Farabi]]. To consider to what extent [[Eastern philosophy]] might have partaken of these important tensions, Strauss thought it best to consider whether [[dharma]] or [[tao]] may be equivalent to [[Nature (philosophy)|Nature]] (by which we mean ''[[physis]]'' in Greek). According to Strauss the beginning of philosophy involved the "discovery or invention of nature" and the "pre-philosophical equivalent of nature" was supplied by "such notions as 'custom' or 'ways{{' "}}, which appear to be ''really universal in all times and places''. The philosophical concept of nature or natures as a way of understanding ''archai'' (first principles of knowledge) brought about a peculiar tension between reasoning on the one hand, and tradition or faith on the other.&lt;ref&gt;"Progress or Return" in An Introduction to Political Philosophy: Ten Essays by Leo Strauss. (Expanded version of Political Philosophy: Six Essays by Leo Strauss, 1975.) Ed. Hilail Gilden. Detroit: Wayne State UP, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is this special history of debate concerning reason and faith in the Islamic, Christian and Jewish traditions, the pursuit of reason is sometimes argued to be compatible with the other practice of other religions of a different nature, such as [[Hinduism]], because they do not define their tenets in such an absolute way.&lt;ref&gt;''Bhagavad Gita'', [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]]: "Hinduism is not just a faith. It is the union of reason and intuition that can not be defined but is only to be experienced."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reason in particular fields of study==

===Reason in political philosophy and ethics===
{{Main article|Political Philosophy|Ethics|The Good}}
[[Aristotle]] famously described reason (with language) as a part of [[human nature]], which means that it is best for humans to live "politically" meaning in communities of about the size and type of a small [[city state]] (''polis'' in Greek). For example...
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is clear, then, that a human being is more of a political [''politikon'' = of the ''polis''] animal [''zōion''] than is any bee or than any of those animals that live in herds. For nature, as we say, makes nothing in vain, and humans are the only animals who possess reasoned speech [''logos'']. Voice, of course, serves to indicate what is painful and pleasant; that is why it is also found in other animals, because their nature has reached the point where they can perceive what is painful and pleasant and express these to each other. But speech [''logos''] serves to make plain what is advantageous and harmful and so also what is just and unjust. For it is a peculiarity of humans, in contrast to the other animals, to have perception of good and bad, just and unjust, and the like; and the community in these things makes a household or city [''polis'']. [...] By nature, then, the drive for such a community exists in everyone, but the first to set one up is responsible for things of very great goodness. For as humans are the best of all animals when perfected, so they are the worst when divorced from law and right. The reason is that injustice is most difficult to deal with when furnished with weapons, and the weapons a human being has are meant by nature to go along with prudence and virtue, but it is only too possible to turn them to contrary uses. Consequently, if a human being lacks virtue, he is the most unholy and savage thing, and when it comes to sex and food, the worst. But justice is something political [to do with the ''polis''], for right is the arrangement of the political community, and right is discrimination of what is just. ([[Aristotle's Politics]] 1253a 1.2. Peter Simpson's translation, with Greek terms inserted in square brackets.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of human nature being fixed in this way, implied, in other words, that we can define what type of community is always best for people. This argument has remained a central argument in all political, ethical and moral thinking since then, and has become especially controversial since firstly [[Rousseau]]'s Second Discourse, and secondly, the [[Theory of Evolution]]. Already in Aristotle there was an awareness that the ''polis'' had not always existed and had needed to be invented or developed by humans themselves. The household came first, and the first villages and cities were just extensions of that, with the first cities being run as if they were still families with Kings acting like fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Politics I.2.1252b15&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Friendship]] [''philia''] seems to prevail [in] man and woman according to [[nature]] [''kata phusin'']; for people are by nature [''tēi phusei''] pairing [''sunduastikon''] more than political [''politikon'' = of the ''polis''], inasmuch as the household [''oikos''] is prior [''proteron'' = earlier] and more necessary than the ''polis'' and making children is more common [''koinoteron''] with the animals. In the other animals, community [''koinōnia''] goes no further than this, but people live together [''sumoikousin''] not only for the sake of making children, but also for the things for life; for from the start the functions [''erga''] are divided, and are different [for] man and woman. Thus they supply each other, putting their own into the common [''eis to koinon'']. It is for these [reasons] that both utility [''chrēsimon''] and pleasure [''hēdu''] seem to be found in this kind of friendship. ([[Nicomachean Ethics]], VIII.12.1162a. Rough literal translation with Greek terms shown in square brackets.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Rousseau]] in his Second Discourse finally took the shocking step of claiming that this traditional account has things in reverse: with reason, language and rationally organized communities all having developed over a long period of time merely as a result of the fact that some habits of cooperation were found to solve certain types of problems, and that once such cooperation became more important, it forced people to develop increasingly complex cooperation—often only to defend themselves from each other.

In other words, according to Rousseau, reason, language and rational community did not arise because of any conscious decision or plan by humans or gods, nor because of any pre-existing human nature. As a result, he claimed, living together in rationally organized communities like modern humans is a development with many negative aspects compared to the original state of man as an ape. If anything is specifically human in this theory, it is the flexibility and adaptability of humans. This view of the animal origins of distinctive human characteristics later received support from [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[Theory of Evolution]].

The two competing theories concerning the origins of reason are relevant to political and ethical thought because, according to the Aristotelian theory, a best way of living together exists independently of historical circumstances. According to Rousseau, we should even doubt that reason, language and politics are a good thing, as opposed to being simply the best option given the particular course of events that lead to today. Rousseau's theory, that human nature is malleable rather than fixed, is often taken to imply, for example by [[Karl Marx]], a wider range of possible ways of living together than traditionally known.

However, while Rousseau's initial impact encouraged bloody revolutions against traditional politics, including both the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], his own conclusions about the best forms of community seem to have been remarkably classical, in favor of city-states such as [[Geneva]], and [[Arcadia (utopia)|rural living]].

===Psychology===
{{Main article|Psychology of reasoning}}
Scientific research into reasoning is carried out within the fields of [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]]. Psychologists attempt to determine whether or not people are capable of rational thought in a number of different circumstances.

Assessing how well someone engages in reasoning is the project of determining the extent to which the person is [[Rationality|rational]] or acts rationally. It is a key research question in the [[psychology of reasoning]]. [[Rationality]] is often divided into its respective [[Rationality#Theoretical and practical rationality|theoretical and practical counterparts]].

====Behavioral experiments on human reasoning====
Experimental cognitive psychologists carry out research on reasoning behaviour. Such research may focus, for example, on how people perform on tests of reasoning such as [[Intelligence tests|intelligence]] or [[IQ]] tests, or on how well people's reasoning matches ideals set by logic (see, for example, the [[Wason test]]).&lt;ref&gt;Manktelow, K.I. 1999. ''Reasoning and Thinking (Cognitive Psychology: Modular Course.)''. Hove, Sussex:Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments examine how people make inferences from conditionals e.g., ''If A then B'' and how they make inferences about alternatives, e.g., ''A or else B''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Laird, P.N. &amp; Byrne, R.M.J. (1991). ''Deduction''. Hillsdale: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; They test whether people can make valid deductions about spatial and temporal relations, e.g., ''A is to the left of B'', or ''A happens after B'', and about quantified assertions, e.g., ''All the A are B''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Laird, P.N. (2006). ''How we reason''. Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments investigate how people make inferences about factual situations, hypothetical possibilities, probabilities, and [[counterfactual thinking|counterfactual]] situations.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, R.M.J. (2005). ''The Rational Imagination: How People Create Counterfactual Alternatives to Reality.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

====Developmental studies of children's reasoning====
Developmental psychologists investigate the development of reasoning from birth to adulthood. Piaget's [[theory of cognitive development]] was the first complete theory of reasoning development. Subsequently, several alternative theories were proposed, including the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]].&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou, A. (1998). Cognitive development. In A. Demetriou, W. Doise, K.F.M. van Lieshout (Eds.), Life-span developmental psychology (pp. 179–269). London: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neuroscience of reasoning====
The biological functioning of the brain is studied by [[neurophysiologist]]s and [[neuropsychologist]]s. Research in this area includes research into the structure and function of normally functioning brains, and of damaged or otherwise unusual brains. In addition to carrying out research into reasoning, some psychologists, for example, [[clinical psychologist]]s and [[psychotherapists]] work to alter people's reasoning habits when they are unhelpful.

===Computer science===

====Automated reasoning====
{{Main article|Automated reasoning|Computational logic}}
In [[artificial intelligence]] and [[computer science]], scientists study and use [[automated reasoning]] for diverse applications including [[automated theorem proving]] the [[formal semantics of programming languages]], and [[formal specification]] in [[software engineering]].

====Meta-reasoning====
{{Main article|Metacognition}}
Meta-reasoning is reasoning about reasoning.  In computer science, a system performs meta-reasoning when it is reasoning about its own operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Meta-reasoning: A Survey |journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=2002|volume=2408/2002|issue=65|first=Stefania |last=Costantini |doi=10.1007/3-540-45632-5_11 |pages=253–288}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This requires a programming language capable of [[reflection (computer science)|reflection]], the ability to observe and modify its own structure and behaviour.

===Evolution of reason===
{{expand section|date=August 2017}}
[[File:Capuchin monkeys sharing.jpg|thumb|right|150px| Dan Sperber believes that reasoning in groups is more effective and promotes their evolutionary fitness.]]
A species could benefit greatly from better abilities to reason about, predict and understand the world. French social and cognitive scientists [[Dan Sperber]] and Hugo Mercier argue that there could have been other forces driving the evolution of reason. They point out that reasoning is very difficult for humans to do effectively, and that it is hard for individuals to doubt their own beliefs ([[confirmation bias]]). Reasoning is most effective when it is done as a collective – as demonstrated by the success of projects like [[science]]. They suggest that there are not just individual, but [[group selection]] pressures at play. Any group that managed to find ways of reasoning effectively would reap benefits for all its members, increasing their [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]. This could also help explain why humans, according to Sperber, are not optimized to reason effectively alone. Their argumentative theory of reasoning claims that reason may have more to do with winning arguments than with the search for the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1017/S0140525X10000968 |url = https://repository.upenn.edu/goldstone/15/| volume = 34| issue = 2| pages = 57–74| last1 = Mercier| first1 = Hugo| last2 = Sperber| first2 = Dan| title = Why Do Humans Reason?

'''Reconciliation ecology''' is the branch of [[ecology]] which studies ways to encourage [[biodiversity]] in [[Human ecosystem|human-dominated]] [[ecosystem]]s. [[Michael Rosenzweig]] first articulated the concept in his book ''[[Win-Win Ecology]]'',&lt;ref name=winwin&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenzweig|first=Michael|title=Win-win Ecology, How the Earth's species can survive in the midst of human enterprise.|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the theory that there is not enough area for all of earth’s biodiversity to be saved within designated [[nature preserve]]s. Therefore, humans should increase biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes. By managing for biodiversity in ways that do not decrease human utility of the system, it is a "[[win-win]]" situation for both human use and native biodiversity. The science is based in the ecological foundation of human land-use trends and species-area relationships. It has many benefits beyond protection of biodiversity, and there are numerous examples of it around the globe. Aspects of reconciliation ecology can already be found in management legislation, but there are challenges in both public acceptance and ecological success of reconciliation attempts.

==Theoretical basis==

===Human land use trends===
{{Main|List of environmental issues}}
Traditional conservation is based on "reservation and restoration"; reservation meaning setting pristine lands aside for the sole purpose of maintaining biodiversity, and restoration meaning returning human impacted ecosystems to their natural state. However, reconciliation ecologists argue that there is too great a proportion of land already impacted by humans for these techniques to succeed.

While it is difficult to measure exactly how much land has been transformed by human use, estimates range from 39 to 50%.  This includes [[agricultural]] land, [[pasture]]land, [[urban area|urban]] areas, and heavily harvested [[forest]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vitousek|first=P. M. |author2=H. A.

Humans have also changed species compositions of many landscapes that they do not dominate directly by introducing new species or harvesting native species. This new assemblage of species has been compared to previous mass extinctions and [[speciation]] events caused by formation of [[land bridge]]s and colliding of continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mooney|first=H.

Cleland |title=The evolutionary impact of invasive species|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=2001|volume=98|pages=5446–5451|doi=10.1073/pnas.091093398|pmid=11344292|issue=10|pmc=33232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Species-area relationships===
[[File:SAR(Species-area curve).gif|250px|thumb|The species-area relationship for a contiguous habitat]]
The need for reconciliation ecology was derived from patterns of species distribution and diversity. The most relevant of these patterns is the [[species-area curve]] which states that a larger geographic area will contain higher species diversity. This relationship has been supported by so large a body of research that some scholars consider it to be an ecological law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lomolino|first=M. V.|title=Ecology's most general, yet protean pattern: the species-area relationship|journal=Journal of Biogeography|year=2000|volume=27|pages=17–26|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.2000.00377.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main reasons for the relationship between number of species and area, both of which can be used as an argument for conservation of larger areas. The habitat heterogeneity hypothesis claims that a larger geographic area will have a greater variety of habitat types, and therefore more species adapted to each unique habitat type. Setting aside a small area will not encompass enough habitat variety to contain a large variety of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenzweig|first=Michael|title=Reconciliation ecology and the future of species diversity|journal=Oryx|year=2003|volume=37|pages=194–206|doi=10.1017/s0030605303000371}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equilibrium hypothesis draws from the theory of [[island biogeography]] as described by [[Robert MacArthur|MacArthur]] and [[E. O. Wilson|Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacArthur, R. H. and E. O. Wilson|title=The Theory of Island Biogeography|year=1967|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large areas have large populations, which are less likely to go extinct through stochastic processes. The theory assumes that speciation rates are constant with area, and a lower extinction rate coupled with higher speciation leads to more species.

The species-area relationship has often been applied to conservation, often quantitatively. The simplest and most commonly used formula was first published by [[Frank W. Preston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Preston|first=F. W.|title=Time and Space and the Variation of Species|journal=Ecology|year=1960|volume=41|pages=612–627|doi=10.2307/1931793}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of species present in a given area increases in relationship to that area with the relationship S = cA&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;/sup&gt;  where S is the number of species, A is the area, and c and z are constants which vary with the system under study. This equation has frequently been used for designing reserve size and placement (see [[SLOSS debate]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Desmet|first=P|author2=R. Cowling |title=Using the species-area relationship to set baseline targets for conservation|journal=Ecology and Society|year=2004|volume=9|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common version of the equation used in reserve design is the formula for inter-island diversity, which has a z-value between 0.25-0.55,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenzweig|first=Michael|title=Species diversity in space and time|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press.|location=Cambridge, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning protecting 5% of the available habitat will preserve 40% of the species present. However, inter-provincial species area relationships have z-values closer to 1, meaning protecting 5% of habitat will only protect 5% of species diversity.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt;

Taken together, proponents of reconciliation ecology see the species-area relationship and human domination of a large percentage of the earth's area as a sign that we will not be able to set aside enough land to protect all of life's biodiversity. There can be negative effects of setting land aside because it means the remaining land is used more intensely.&lt;ref name=Green /&gt; For example, less land is required for crop production when high levels of inorganic [[fertilizer]] is applied, but these chemicals will affect nearby land set aside for natural ecosystems. The direct benefits of land transformation for the growing world population often make it ethically difficult to justify the tradeoff between biodiversity and human use.&lt;ref name=Daily&gt;{{cite book|last=Daily|first=Gretchen|title=Countryside biogeography and the provision of ecosystem services.in Forum on Biodivesity.|year=1997|publisher=National Academy Press|location=National Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reconciled ecosystems are ones in which humans dominate, but natural biodiversity is encouraged to persist within the human landscape. Ideally, this creates a more sustainable [[socio-ecological system]] and does not necessitate a trade off between biodiversity and human use.

===Beyond natural history===
[[File:Lanius excubitor 1 (Marek Szczepanek).jpg|250px|thumb|The life history of the [[great grey shrike]] is better understood as a result of focused natural history and reconciliation ecology.]]
How can understanding of species' natural history aid their effective conservation in human-dominated ecosystems?  Humans often conduct activities that allow for the incorporation of other species, whether as a by-product or as a result of a focus on nature.&lt;ref name="Rosenzweig 2005" /&gt;  Traditional [[natural history]] can only inform how best to do this to a certain degree, because landscapes have been changed so dramatically.  However, there is much more to learn through direct study of species' ecology in human-dominated [[ecosystems]], through what is known as focused natural history.  Rosenzweig &lt;ref name="Rosenzweig 2005" /&gt; cites four examples: [[shrikes]] (Laniidae) thrived in altered landscapes when wooden fence post perches allowed them easy access to pouncing on prey, but inhospitable [[steel fence post]]s contributed to their decline.  Replacing steel fence posts with wood fence posts reverses the shrikes' decline and allows humans to determine the reasons for the distribution and abundance of shrikes.  Additionally, the [[cirl bunting]] (''Emberiza cirlus'') thrived on farms when fields alternated between harvests and hay, but declined where farmers began to plant winter grain crops, [[natterjack toads]] (''Bufo calamatus'') declined when reductions in [[sheep]] grazing ceased to alter ponds to their preferred shape and depth, and [[longleaf pine]] (''Pinus palustris'') declined in the Southeastern United States when lack of [[wildfires]] prevented its return after [[timbering]].&lt;ref name="Rosenzweig 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenzweig | first1 = M.L. | year = 2005 | title = Avoiding mass extinction: basic and applied challenges | url = | journal = The American Midland Naturalist | volume = 153 | issue = | pages = 195–208 | doi=10.1674/0003-0031(2005)153[0195:amebaa]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Noss 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Noss | first1 = R.F. | last2 = Beier | first2 = P. | last3 = Covington | first3 = W.W. | last4 = Grumbine | first4 = R.E. | last5 = Lindenmayer | first5 = D.B. | last6 = Prather | first6 = J.W. | last7 = Schmiegelow | first7 = F. | last8 = Sisk | first8 = T.D. | last9 = Vosick | first9 = D.J. | year = 2006 | title = Recommendations for integrating restoration ecology and conservation biology in ponderosa pine forests of the southwestern united states | url = | journal = Restoration Ecology | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 4–10 | doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2006.00099.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, applying focused natural history in human-dominated landscapes can contribute to conservation efforts.

The emerging concept of [[ecosystem services]] (coined by the [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] in 2005) changed the way ecologists perceived so-called "ordinary species" : as abundant species represent the bulk of biomass and biological processes, even if they don't appear directly threatened their conservation constitutes as a major concern for maintaining these services on which rely both human societies and rarer species.&lt;ref name="Couvet"/&gt; Reconciliation ecology then proposes to take care of such species and to maintain (or restore) ecological processes in human-dominated ecosystems, hence creating ecological corridors and preserving a good functioning of biological cycles.&lt;ref name="Couvet"/&gt;

==Benefits==
Reconciliation ecologists believe increasing biodiversity within human dominated landscapes will help to save global biodiversity. This is sometimes preferable to traditional conservation because it does not impair human use of the landscape and therefore may be more acceptable to stakeholders.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt; However, not only will it encourage biodiversity in the areas where it takes place, but many scholars cite other benefits of including biodiversity in human landscapes on both global conservation activities and human well-being.

===Habitat connectivity benefits===
Increasing wildlife habitat in human-dominated systems not only increases ''in situ'' biodiversity, it also aids in conservation of surrounding protected areas by increasing connectivity between habitat patches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anand|first=M. O|author2=J. Krishnaswamy |author3=A. Kumar |author4=A.

===Educational benefits===
Placing importance on native ecosystems and biodiversity within human landscapes increases human exposure to natural areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=J. R|title=Biodiversity conservation and the extinction of experience|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|year=2005|volume=20|pages=430–434|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.05.013|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been shown to increase appreciation of nature. Studies have shown that students who participate in [[outdoor education]] programs show a greater understanding of their environment, greater willingness to act in order to save the environment, and even a greater enthusiasm for school and learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bogner|first=F. X|title=The influence of short-term outdoor ecology education on long-term variables of environmental perspective|journal=The Journal of Environmental Education|year=1998|volume=29|pages=17–29|doi=10.1080/00958969809599124|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dillon|first=J. |author2=M.

Benefield|title=The value of outdoor learning: evidence from research in the UK and elsewhere|journal=School Science Review|year=2006|volume=87|pages=107–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green spaces have also been shown connect urban dwellers of all ages with nature, even when dominated by [[invasive species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Teillac-Deschamps|first=P |author2=R.

===Psychological benefits===
The results of reconciliation ecology can also improve human well-being. [[E. O. Wilson]] has hypothesized that humans have an innate desire to be close to nature (see [[biophilia hypothesis|Biophilia]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=E O|title=Biophilia|year=1984|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous studies have linked natural settings to decreased stress and faster recovery during hospital stays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ulrich|first=R. S.|author2=R. F. Simons |author3=B. D. Losito |author4=E. Fiorito |author5=M. A. Miles |author6=M. Zelson |title=Stress recovery during exposures to natural and urban environments|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|year=1991|volume=11|pages=201–230|doi=10.1016/S0272-4944(05)80184-7|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Many examples of native plants and animals taking advantage of human dominated landscapes have been unintentional, but may be enhanced as part of reconciliation ecology. Others are intentional redesigns of human landscapes to better accommodate native biodiversity. These have been going on for many hundreds of years including examples within agricultural systems, urban and suburban systems, marine systems, and even industrial areas.

===Historical examples===
While Rosenzweig formalized the concept, humans have been encouraging biodiversity within human landscapes for millennia. In the Trebon Biosphere Reserve of the [[Czech Republic]], a system of human-engineered [[aquaculture]] ponds built in the 1500s not only provides a profitable harvest of fish, but also provides habitat for a hugely diverse wetland ecosystem. Many cities in Europe take pride in their local population of [[storks]], which nest on roofs or in church towers that replace the trees they would naturally nest in.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt; There are records of humans maintaining plants in pleasure gardens as early as ancient [[Mesopotamia]], with an especially strong tradition of incorporating gardens into the architecture of human landscapes in [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=X.|author2=J. Wu |title=Sustainable landscape architecture: implications of the Chinese philosophy of "unity of man with nature" and beyond|journal=Landscape Ecology|year=2009|volume=24|pages=1015–1026|doi=10.1007/s10980-009-9350-z|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural systems===
[[File:Faidherbia albida.JPG|250px|thumb|[[Agroforestry]] in [[Burkina Faso]] allows [[sorghum]] crop to be grown under native tree species, preserving biodiversity.]]
[[Agroforestry]] provides many examples of reconciliation ecology at work. In tropical agroforestry systems, crops such as [[coffee]] or fruit trees are cultivated under a canopy of shade trees, providing habitat for tropical forest species outside of protected areas.&lt;ref name=bhagwat&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bhagwat|first=S. A. |author2=K. J. Willis |author3=H. J. B. Birks |author4=R. J. Whittaker|title=Agroforestry: a refuge for tropical biodiversity?|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|year=2008|volume=23|pages=261–268|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2008.01.005|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[shade-grown coffee]] plantations typically have lower tree diversity than unmanaged forests, however they have much higher tree species diversity and richness than other agricultural methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Correia|first=M|author2=M. Diabate |author3=P. Beavogui |author4=K. Guilavogui |author5=N. Lamanda |author6=H. d.

The [[oil palm]] (''Elaeis guineensis'') provides another example of the potential of reconciliation ecology.  It is one of the most important and rapidly expanding tropical crops,&lt;ref name="Koh 2008a" /&gt; so lucrative because it is used in many products throughout the world. Unfortunately, oil-palm agriculture is one of the main drivers of forest conversion in Southeast Asia and is devastating for native [[biodiversity]], perhaps even more so than logging.&lt;ref name="Wilcove 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilcove | first1 = D.S. | last2 = Koh | first2 = L.P. | year = 2010 | title = Addressing the threats to biodiversity from oil-palm agriculture | url = | journal = Conservation of Biodiversity | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 999–1007 | doi=10.1007/s10531-009-9760-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, attempts are being made to foster the sustainability of this industry.  As a [[monoculture]], oil palm is subject to potentially devastating attacks from insect pests.&lt;ref name="Koh 2008a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koh | first1 = L.P. | year = 2008 | title = Can oil palm plantations be made more hospitable for forest butterflies and birds? | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Ecology | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 1002–1009 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01491.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koh 2008b"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koh | first1 = L.P. | year = 2008 | title = Birds defend oil palms from herbivorous insects | url = | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 821–825 | doi=10.1890/07-1650.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies are attempting an [[integrated pest management]] approach which encourages the planting of species that support [[Predation|predators]] and [[parasitoids]] of these insect pests, as well as an active native bird community.&lt;ref name="Koh 2008b" /&gt; Experiments have shown that a functioning bird community, especially at higher densities, can serve to reduce insect herbivory on oil palms, promoting increased crop yields and profits.&lt;ref name="Koh 2008b" /&gt;  Thus, oil palm plantation managers can participate in reconciliation ecology by promoting local vegetation that is beneficial to [[insectivorous]] birds, including maintaining ground plants that serve as nesting sites, thereby protecting natural communities.  Additionally, steps such as maintaining [[riparian buffer zones]] or natural forest patches can help to slow the [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] within oil palm plantation landscapes.&lt;ref name="Wilcove 2010" /&gt;  By engaging in these environmentally friendly practices, fewer chemicals and less effort are required to maintain both plantation productivity and [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref name="Koh 2008a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Koh 2008b" /&gt;

There are many grazing practices that also encourage native biodiversity. In Rosenzweig’s book he uses the example of a rancher in [[Arizona]] who intentionally deepened his cattle ponds in order to save a population of threatened [[leopard frog]]s (''Rana chiricahuensis''), with no detriment to the use of those tanks for cattle,&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt; and a similar situation has occurred with the vulnerable [[California tiger salamander]] (''Ambystoma californiense'') in the Central Valley of California. Research has shown that without cattle grazing, many of the remaining [[vernal pool]]s would dry too early for the salamanders to complete their life cycle under global climate change predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pyke|first=C. R.|author2=J. Marty |title=Cattle Grazing Mediates Climate Change Impacts on Ephemeral Wetlands|journal=Conservation Biology|year=2005|volume=19|issue=5|pages=1619–1625|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00233.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Central America, a large percentage of pastureland is fenced using live trees which are not only low maintenance for the farmer, but also provide habitat for birds, bats, and invertebrates which cannot persist in open pastureland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harvey|first=C.

===Urban systems===
[[File:MEC's green roof among others.jpg|250px|thumb|Green roofs can help maintain species diversity in urban landscapes.]]
[[Urban ecology]] can be included under the umbrella of reconciliation ecology and it tackles biodiversity in cities, the most extreme of human-dominated landscapes. Cities occupy less than 3% of global surface area, but are responsible for a majority of carbon emissions, residential water use, and wood use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=L. R.|title=Eco-Economy: building an economy for the Earth|year=2001|publisher=Norton|location=New York, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities also have unique climatic conditions such as the [[urban heat island]] effect, which can greatly affect biodiversity.&lt;ref name=Grimm&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grimm|first=N. B.|author2=S. H. Faeth |author3=N. E. Golubiewski |author4=C. L. Redman |author5=J. Wu |author6=X. Bai |author7=J. M.

Cities often have surprisingly high plant biodiversity due to their normally high degree of habitat heterogeneity and high numbers of gardens and green spaces cultivated to include a large variety of species.&lt;ref name=Grimm /&gt; However, these species are often not native, and a large part of the total urban biodiversity is usually made up of exotic species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=G |author2=G. Jiang |author3=Y. Zhou |author4=Q. Liu |author5=Y. Ji |author6=S. Wang |author7=S. Chen |author8=H.

Because cities are so highly impacted by human activities, restoration to the pristine state is not possible, however there are modifications that can be made to increase habitat without negatively impacting human needs. In urban rivers, addition of large woods and floating islands to provide habitat, modifications to walls and other structures to mimic natural banks, and buffer areas to reduce pollutants can all increase biodiversity without reducing the [[flood control]] and water supply services.&lt;ref name=Francis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Francis|first=R. A.|title=Perspectives on the potential for reconciliation ecology in urban riverscapes|journal=CAB Reviews: Perspectives in Agriculture, Veterinary Science, Nutrition and Natural Resources|year=2009|volume=4|pages=1–20|doi=10.1079/pavsnnr20094073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban green spaces can be re-designed to encourage natural ecosystems rather than manicured [[lawn]]s, as is seen in the [[National Wildlife Federation]]’s Backyard Wildlife Habitat program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tufts, C. and P. Loewer|title=Gardening for wildlife|year=1995|publisher=Rodale Press|location=Emmaus, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peregrine falcon]]s (''Falco peregrinus''), which were once endangered by [[pesticide]] use, are frequently seen nesting in tall urban buildings throughout North America, feeding chiefly on the introduced [[rock dove]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cade|first=T|author2=D. Bird |title=Peregrine falcons, Falco peregrinus, nesting in an urban environment: a review|journal=Canadian Field-Naturalist|year=1990|volume=104|pages=209–218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steep walls of buildings mimic the cliffs peregrines naturally nest in and the rock doves replace the native prey species that were driven out of urban areas.

===Industrial systems===
{{further|industrial ecology}}
In Florida, the [[Florida manatee]] (''Trichechus manatus latirostris'') uses warm water discharged from power plants as a refuge when the temperature of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] drops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laist|first=D. W.|author2=J. E. Reynolds |title=Florida manatees, warm-water refuges, and an uncertain future|journal=Coastal Management|year=2005|volume=33|pages=279–295|doi=10.1080/08920750590952018|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These warm areas replace the warm springs that manatees once naturally used in the winter. These springs have been drained or cut off from open water by human uses. [[American crocodile]]s (''Crocodylus acutus'') have a similar habitat in the cooling canals of the [[Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station|Turkey Point]] power plant, where an estimated 10% of the total North American population of the species lives.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt;

[[Wastewater treatment]] systems have shown potential for reconciliation ecology on numerous occasions. Man-made wetlands designed to remove nitrogen before runoff from agriculture enters the [[Everglades]] in Florida are used as breeding sites for a number of birds, including the endangered [[wood stork]] (''Mycteria americana'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frederick|first=P.

===Ocean systems===
[[Coral reefs]] have been intensively impacted by human use, including [[overfishing]] and mining of the reef itself. One reconciliation approach to this problem is building [[artificial reef]]s that not only provide valuable habitat for aquatic species, but also protect nearby islands from storms when the natural structure has been mined away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=S|author2=A. J.

E|author2=J. E. Norris |title=An analysis of four artificial reef designs in tropical waters|journal=Bulletin of Marine Science|year=1989|volume=44|pages=934–941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
Governmental intervention can aid in encouraging private landowners to create habitat or otherwise increase biodiversity on their land. The United States' [[Endangered Species Act]] requires landowners to halt any activities negatively affecting endangered species on their land, which is a disincentive for them to encourage endangered species to settle on their land in the first place.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt; To help mediate this problem, the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] has instituted safe harbor agreements whereby the landowner engages in restoration on their land to encourage endangered species, and the government agrees not to place further regulation on their activities should they want to reverse the restoration at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilcove|first=D. S|author2=J. Lee |title=Using economic and regulatory incentives to restore endangered species: lessons learned from three new programs|journal=Conservation Biology|year=2004|issue=3|pages=639–645|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00250.x|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice has already led to an increase in [[aplomado falcon]]s (''Falco femoralis'') in [[Texas]] and [[red-cockaded woodpecker]]s (''Picoides borealis'') in the Southeastern US.

Another example is the [[US Department of Agriculture]]’s [[Conservation Reserve Program]] (CRP). The CRP was originally put in place to protect soil from erosion, but also has major implications for conservation of biodiversity.  In the program, landowners take their land out of agricultural production and plant trees, shrubs, and other permanent, [[erosion control]]ling vegetation. Unintended, but ecologically significant consequences of this were the reduction of runoff, improved water quality, creation of wildlife habitat, and possible [[carbon sequestration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunn|first=C. P|author2=F. Stearns |author3=G. R. Guntenspergen |author4=D. M. Sharpe |title=Ecological benefits of the Conservation Reserve Program|journal=Conservation Biology|year=1993|volume=7|pages=132–139|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1993.07010132.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
While reconciliation ecology attempts to modify the human world to encourage biodiversity without negatively impacting human use, there are still difficulties in getting broad acceptance of the idea. For example, addition of large woods to urban river systems, which provides critical habitat structure for native fish and invertebrates may be seen as "untidy" and a sign of poor management by residents.&lt;ref name=Francis /&gt; Similarly, many suburban areas do not allow long, unkempt lawns that provide useful wildlife habitat because of perceived damage to property values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robbins|first=P|author2=A. Polderman |author3=T. Birkenholtz |title=Lawns and Toxins: An Ecology of the City|journal=Cities|year=2001|volume=18|pages=369–380|doi=10.1016/S0264-2751(01)00029-4|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many humans have negative feelings toward certain species, especially [[predator]]s such as wolves, which are often based more on perceived risk than actual risk of loss or injury resulting from the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berger|first=K. M|title=Carnivore-Livestock Conflicts: Effects of Subsidized Predator Control and Economic Correlates on the Sheep Industry|journal=Conservation Biology|year=2006|volume=20|pages=751–761|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00336.x|pmid=16909568|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even with cooperation of the human element of the equation, reconciliation ecology can not help every species. Some animals, such as several species of [[waterfowl]], show strong avoidance behaviors toward humans and any form of human disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gill|first=J. A|author2=K. Norris |author3=W. J. Sutherland |title=Why behavioral responses may not reflect the population consequences of human disturbance|journal=Biological Conservation|year=2001|volume=97|pages=265–268|doi=10.1016/S0006-3207(00)00002-1|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; No matter how nice an urban park is built, the proximity of humans will scare away some birds. Other species must maintain large territories, and barriers that abound in human habitats, such as roads, will stop them from coexisting with humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riley|first=S. P. D|author2=J. P. Pollinger |author3=R. M. Savajot |author4=E. C. York |author5=C. Bromley |author6=T. Fuller |author7=R. K. Wayne |title=A southern California freeway is a physical and social barrier to gene flow in carnivores|journal=Molecular Ecology|year=2006|volume=15|pages=1733–1741|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.02907.x|pmid=16689893|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These animals will require undisturbed land set aside for them.

There is hence a double social challenge for reconciliation ecology : making people's perception of biodiversity evolve, and then changing relating norms and policies so as to better consider biodiversity as a positive component in our habitat.&lt;ref name="Couvet"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Couvet|first=Denis|last2=Ducarme|first2=Frédéric|title=Reconciliation ecology, from biological to social challenges|journal=Revue d'ethnoécologie|year=2014|volume=6|pages=|doi=10.4000/ethnoecologie.1979 |pmid=|issue=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[China|Chinese]] and other [[East Asia]]n  and [[Southeast Asia]]n societies, a '''red envelope''', '''red packet''', '''''lì xì''''' (Vietnamese), '''''lai see''''' ([[Cantonese language|Cantonese]]), '''''âng-pau''''' ([[Hokkien]]) or '''''hóngbāo''''' ([[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]) is a monetary gift which is given during holidays or special occasions such as weddings, graduation or the birth of a baby.

Outside of China, similar customs have been adopted across parts of Southeast Asia and many other countries with a sizable ethnic Chinese population. 

In China, the Chinese mobile app [[WeChat]] popularized the distribution of red envelopes in 2014 via [[mobile payments]] over the internet. This method of distributing red envelopes is now quite popular in the country.

==Usage==
Red envelopes are gifts presented at social and family gatherings such as [[Chinese marriage|weddings]] or holidays such as [[Chinese New Year]]. The [[Color in Chinese culture|red color]] of the [[envelope]] symbolizes [[good luck]] and is a symbol to ward off evil spirits. The act of requesting red packets is normally called ''tao hongbao'' ({{zh|t=討紅包|hp=tǎo hóngbāo}}) or ''yao lishi'' ({{zh|t=要利是|hp=yào lì shì|links=no}}), and in the south of China, ''dou li shi'' ({{zh|t=逗利是|hp=dòu lì shì||cy=dau6 lai6 si6|links=no}}). Red envelopes are usually given out by married couples to single people, regardless of age, or by older to younger ones during holidays and festivals.

The amount of money contained in the envelope usually ends with an even digit, in accordance with [[Numbers in Chinese culture|Chinese beliefs]]; odd-numbered money gifts are traditionally associated with funerals.  The exception being the number 9 as it pronunciation of ''nine'' is homophonus to the word ''long'' and is the largest digit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fengshuiweb.co.uk/advice/angpow.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Still in some regions of China and in [[Chinese diaspora|its diaspora community]], odd numbers are favored for weddings because they are difficult to divide. There is also a widespread tradition that money should not be given in fours, or the number four should not appear in the amount, such as in 40, 400 and 444, as the pronunciation of the word ''four'' is homophonous to the word ''death''.

At wedding banquets, the amount offered is usually intended to cover the cost of the attendees as well as signify goodwill to the newlyweds. Amounts given are often recorded in ceremonial ledgers for the new couple to keep.

During the Chinese New Year, in Southern China, red envelopes are typically given by the married to the unmarried, most of whom are children. In northern and southern China, red envelopes are typically given by the elders to the younger under 25 (30 in most of the three northeastern provinces), regardless of marital status, while in some regions red envelopes are only given to the young people without jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Students and future students in the sciences are typically rewarded handsomely&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of money is usually notes to avoid heavy coins and to make it difficult to judge the amount inside before opening. It is traditional to put brand new notes inside red envelopes and also to avoid opening the envelopes in front of the relatives out of courtesy.

It is also given during the Chinese New Year in workplace from a person of authority (supervisors or owner of the business) out of his own fund to employees as a token of good fortune for the upcoming year.

In acting, it is also conventional to give an actor a red packet when he or she is to play a dead character, or pose for a picture for an obituary or a grave stone. 

Red packets are also used to deliver payment for favorable service to [[lion dance]] performers, religious practitioners, teachers, and doctors.

=== Digital red envelopes ===
During the Chinese New Year holiday in 2014, the [[mobile app|mobile]] [[instant messaging]] service [[WeChat]] introduced the ability to distribute virtual red envelopes of money to contacts and groups via its [[mobile payment]] platform. The feature became considerably popular, owing to its contemporary interpretation of the traditional practice, and a promotional giveaway held during the [[CCTV New Year's Gala]], China's most-watched television special, where viewers could win red envelopes as prizes. Adoption of WeChat Pay saw a major increase following the launch, and two years later, over 32 billion virtual envelopes were sent over the Chinese New Year holiday in 600bc (itself a tenfold increase over 2015). The popularity spawned a "red envelope war" between WeChat owner [[Tencent]] and its historic rival, [[Alibaba Group]], which added a similar function to its competing messaging service and has held similar giveaway promotions, and imitations of the feature from other vendors.&lt;ref name="fastco-redpacket"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Social Cash Made WeChat The App For Everything|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3065255/china-wechat-tencent-red-envelopes-and-social-money|website=Fast Company|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Doug|title=Red envelope wars in China, Xiaomi eyes US|url=http://www.scmp.com/comment/blogs/article/1715981/red-envelope-wars-china-xiaomi-eyes-us|accessdate=18 February 2015|agency=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chun|first1=Flora|last2=Lee|first2=Chun|title=Silicon Valley Startup Reinvents an Ancient Tradition: The Red Envelope|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1238540-silicon-valley-startup-reinvents-an-ancient-tradition-the-red-envelope/|accessdate=18 February 2015|agency=Epoch Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts estimated that over 100 billion digital red envelopes would be sent over the New Year holiday in 2017.&lt;ref name="bbc-virtual"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why this Chinese New Year will be a digital money fest|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-38746298|website=BBC News|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caixinglobal.com/2017-01-13/tencent-alibaba-send-lunar-new-year-revelers-money-hunting-101043798.html|title=Tencent, Alibaba Send Lunar New Year Revelers Money-Hunting - Caixin Global|website=www.caixinglobal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
In China, during the [[Qin Dynasty]], the elderly would thread coins with a red string. The money was referred to as "money warding off evil spirits" ({{zh|t=壓祟錢|hp=yāsuì qián|links=no}}) and was believed to protect the person of younger generation from sickness and death.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The ''yasui qian'' was replaced by red envelopes when printing presses became more common and is now found written using the homophone for ''{{lang|zh|suì}}'' that means "old age" instead of "evil spirits" thus, "money warding off old age" ({{zh|t=壓歲錢|hp=yāsuì qián|links=no}}). Red envelopes continue to be referred to by such names today.

==Other customs==
Other similar traditions also exist in other countries in Asia. In [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]] (Burma) and [[Cambodia]], the Chinese diaspora and immigrants have introduced the culture of red envelopes.

In Cambodia, red envelopes are called Ang Pav or Tae Ea(give Ang Pav). Ang Pav is delivered with best wishes from elder to younger generations. The money amount in Ang Pav makes young children happy and is a most important gift which traditionally reflects the best wishes as a symbol of good luck for the elders. Ang Pav can be presented in the day of Chinese New Year or "Saen Chen", when relatives gather together. The gift is kept as a worship item in or under the pillowcase, or somewhere else, especially near the bed of young while they are sleeping in New Year time. Gift in Ang Pav can be either money or a cheque, and more or less according to the charity of the donors.
The tradition of the delivery of Ang Pav traditionally descended from one generation to another a long time ago. Ang Pav will not be given to some one in family who has got a career, but this person has to, in return, deliver it to their parents and/or their younger children or siblings.
At weddings, the amount offered is usually intended to cover the cost of the attendees as well as help the newly married couple.

In Vietnam, red envelopes are considered to be lucky money and are typically given to children. They are generally given by the elders and adults, where a greeting or offering health and longevity is exchanged by the younger generation. Common greetings include "Sống lâu trăm tuổi", "An khang thịnh vượng" (安康興旺), "Vạn sự như ý" (萬事如意) and Sức khỏe dồi dào, which all relate back to the idea of wishing health and prosperity as age besets everyone in Vietnam on the Lunar New Year. The typical name for lucky money is lì xì or, less commonly, mừng tuổi.

In South Korea and Japan, a monetary gift is given to children by their relatives during the New Year period. In both countries, however, white envelopes are used instead of red, with the name of the receiver written on the back. A similar practice, [[Shūgi-bukuro]], is observed for Japanese weddings, but the envelope is folded rather than sealed, and decorated with an elaborate bow.

In the [[Philippines]], [[Chinese Filipino]]s exchange red envelopes (termed ''ang pao'') during the Lunar New Year, which is an easily recognisable symbol. The red envelope has gained wider acceptance among non-Chinese Filipinos, who have appropriated the custom for other occasions such as birthdays, and in giving monetary ''[[aguinaldo]]'' during [[Christmas in the Philippines|Christmas]].

Red packets as a form of bribery in China's film industry were revealed in 2014's [[Sony Pictures Entertainment hack|Sony hack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fox-Brewster|first1=Thomas|title=Inside Sony's Mysterious 'Red Pockets': Hackers Blow Open China Bribery Probe|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2014/12/13/sony-pictures-hackers-reveal-mysterious-red-packets-payments-in-china/|accessdate=18 February 2015|agency=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green envelope===
{{Main|Green envelope}}
[[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] Muslims in [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Singapore]] have adopted the Chinese custom of handing out monetary gifts in envelopes as part of their [[Eid al-Fitr]] ([[Bahasa Melayu|Malay]]: ''[[Hari Raya Aidilfitri]]'') celebrations, but instead of red packets, green envelopes are used. Customarily a family will have (usually small) amounts of money in green envelopes ready for [[Hospitality|visitors]], and may send them to friends and family unable to visit. [[Green#Religion|Green]] is used for its traditional association with [[Islam]], and the adaptation of the red envelope is based on the Muslim custom of ''[[sadaqah]]'', or voluntary charity. While present in the [[Qur'an]], ''sadaqah'' is much less formally established than the sometimes similar practice of ''[[zakat]]'', and in many cultures this takes a form closer to gift-giving and generosity among friends than charity in the strict sense, i.e. no attempt is made to give more to guests "in need", nor is it as a religious obligation as Islamic charity is often viewed.

===Purple envelope===
The tradition of ''ang pao'' has also been adopted by the local Indian Hindu populations of [[Indian Singaporeans|Singapore]] and [[Malaysian Indian|Malaysia]] for [[Diwali|Deepavali]]. They are known as ''Deepavali ang pow'' (in Malaysia), ''purple ang pow'' or simply ''ang pow'' (in Singapore).&lt;ref&gt;http://design-cu.jp/iasdr2013/papers/1893-1b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Yellow coloured envelopes for Deepavali have also been available at times in the past.&lt;ref&gt;http://chinesenewyearlanterns.blogspot.com.au/2013/12/uses-of-ang-pow-among-different-races.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=February 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9493">The '''Rule of Law in Armed Conflicts Project''' ('''RULAC Project''') is an initiative of the [[Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights]] to support the application and implementation of the [[Public international law|international]] [[Laws of war|law of armed conflict]].

==Overview==
Through a global [[database]] and analysis, the RULAC Project has as its aim an assessment of the implementation by [[Sovereign state|states]] of the law applicable in armed conflicts: 
*[[international humanitarian law]] 
*[[international human rights law]]
*[[international criminal law]]
*[[refugee law]]

The project will ultimately cover all [[List of United Nations member states|member states of the United Nations]] and parties to the [[Geneva Conventions]] as well as contested territories, whether they are in situation of armed conflict or not. Indeed, certain international rules must be implemented during peacetime or are relevant in post-conflict situations, in particular those relating to the repression of international crimes. In addition, the rules regarding the fight against [[terrorism]], also to be covered by the website, are applicable to states that are not necessarily in a situation of armed conflict.

The website is divided into three parts. The homepage offers a small description of the applicable law and addresses the main legal issues in that area, for example the legal qualification of conflicts or the applicability of international law to non-state armed groups. The website then offers for each country the relevant texts and documents dealing with the national and international legal framework (national [[legislation]] and [[case law]], [[Resolution (law)|resolutions]] of [[intergovernmental organizations]], [[treaty]], etc.). Finally, the website offers a legal analysis that, on one hand, qualifies the conflict under international humanitarian law and on the other hand, determines the applicable law. This part of the website, certainly the most delicate in juridical and political terms, is particular to the RULAC Project.

The RULAC Project should prove to be a precious source of information for government officials, journalists and more widely for any person interested by the respect of the law in war.

==Geneva Conventions==
The first three Geneva Conventions were revised, expanded, and replaced, and the fourth one was added, in 1949.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5262">{{Expert-subject|Law|date=April 2015}} '''''Scienter''''' is a legal term for [[intent (law)|intent]] or [[knowledge]] of [[wrongdoing]]. An offending party then has knowledge of the "wrongness" of an act or event prior to committing it.

For example, if a man sells a car with brakes that do not work to his friend, but the seller does not know about the brake problem, the seller then has no ''scienter''. If he sells the car and knew of the problem before he sold the car, he has ''scienter''.

The word has the same [[etymology|root]] as ''[[science]]'', the [[Latin]] ''scienter'' (knowingly), from ''scire'' (to know, to separate one thing from another).

==Scienter action in tort law==
The scienter action is a category within [[tort]] law in some [[common law]] jurisdictions that deals with the damage done by an animal directly to a human. It had a long history in [[English law]] until it was abolished by the [[Animals Act 1971]]. An action in the [[common law jurisdictions]] in which it has not been extinguished by statute is in addition to the torts of [[negligence]] and [[nuisance]] or more bespoke torts like [[cattle trespass]]. If an animal is known to behave in a certain way and is expressed on a person causing injury, an action can be taken in this tort, which also is not available in [[New South Wales]], the [[Australian Capital Territory]], [[South Australia]] or [[New Zealand]]. In those jurisdictions, the actions involving animals need to be in nuisance or negligence. 

To be successful, the plaintiff needs to take action against the person in control of the animal. It is [[strict liability]], requiring no more than proof of injury, the animal's having a problematic trait, and the knowledge of the person in control about the trait in the animal. Strict liability means that there is no need to argue fault in the form of wilful intent or negligence on the part of the animal or its controller. The only defence is if it can be proved the plaintiff voluntarily assumed the risk of injury by their actions, or if the plaintiff was the cause of the injury. 

It is common to distinguish between harmless animals and wild animals, as no scienter is needed for wild animals. Animals are classed as wild or harmless on the basis of species or kind, not on the basis of being a tame individual. An elephant is considered wild regardless of its use. The scienter action is referred to in ''[[Rylands v. Fletcher]]'' in that one who keeps a wild thing "must keep it at his peril" to make reference to part of Justice [[Colin Blackburn]]'s comment.

==General use==

Scienter is generally used as a necessary condition of certain causes of civil action and as a standard for civil liability or criminal [[guilt (law)|guilt]]. For instance, Section 1960 of Title 18 of the [[United States Code]] provides a ''scienter'' condition, requiring that the accused "knowingly conducts, controls, manages, supervises, directs, or owns" a prohibited type of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|18|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of scienter is uniformly expressed in the text of the U.S. Code as the word ''know'', appearing as "knowingly", "actual knowledge", "known", "knowledge fairly implied", etc.  The word ''scienter'' is not used in the text of the U.S. Code, although it appears once in a section title.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|15|7706}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This use reflects the development of American law speaking plainly instead of employing Latin phrases of [[legal English]].

==In contract law==

''Scienter'' is also an element of the [[contract law]] [[cause of action]] for [[breach of contract]] in which the aggrieved party alleges some destruction of the [[meeting of the minds]], also known as mutual assent, because of [[fraud]], [[misrepresentation]] or duress [[per minas]].

''Scienter'' can also be used as a [[defense (legal)|defense]] to a breach of contract [[lawsuit]].

==Element of claim of securities fraud==
In the [[United States]], to prevail in a securities fraud claim under Section 10(b) of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]], a plaintiff must allege and prove that the defendant acted with ''scienter''.

The [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]] of 1995 added the requirement that a plaintiff must plead facts giving rise to a "strong inference" of ''scienter''. The meaning of ''scienter'' under the 1995 law has been very controversial since its enactment. The [[United States Supreme Court]] issued a decision that clarified what was to be understood as a "strong inference." In ''Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues &amp; Rights, LTD'' (21 June 2007), an 8-1 ruling of the Court defined the standard that the plaintiff had to meet to proceed with a securities fraud litigation. A complaint must show "cogent and compelling evidence" of ''scienter''.

This index captures theuman Development of the average person in society, which is less than when there is inequality in the distribution of health, education and income.]]

'''Social inequality''' occurs when resources in a given society are distributed unevenly, typically through [[Norm (social)|norms]] of allocation, that engender specific patterns along lines of socially defined categories of persons. It is the differentiation preference of access of social goods in the society brought about by power, religion, kinship, prestige, race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and class. The social rights include labor market, the source of income, health care, and freedom of speech, education, political representation, and participation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wade|first1=Robert H.|title=The Piketty phenomenon and the future of inequality|journal=Real World Economics Review|date=2014|issue=69–7|pages=2–17|url=http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue69/Wade69.pdf|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social inequality linked to [[economic inequality]], usually described on the basis of the [[income inequality|unequal distribution of income]] or [[wealth]], is a frequently studied type of social inequality. Though the disciplines of [[economics]] and [[sociology]] generally use different theoretical approaches to examine and explain economic inequality, both fields are actively involved in [[researching]] this inequality. However, social and natural resources other than purely economic resources are also unevenly distributed in most societies and may contribute to [[social status]]. Norms of allocation can also affect the distribution of [[rights]] and [[Privilege (social inequality)|privileges]], [[Power (social and political)|social power]], access to [[public goods]] such as [[education]] or the [[judiciary|judicial system]], adequate [[Housing inequality|housing]], [[transportation]], [[Credit (finance)|credit]] and [[financial services]] such as [[banking]] and other social [[Good (economics)|good]]s and services.

Many societies worldwide claim to be [[Meritocracy|meritocracies]]—that is, that their societies exclusively distribute resources on the basis of merit. The term "meritocracy" was coined by [[Michael Young, Baron Young of Dartington|Michael Young]] in his 1958 dystopian essay "[[The Rise of the Meritocracy]]" to demonstrate the social dysfunctions that he anticipated arising in societies where the elites believe that they are successful entirely on the basis of merit, so the adoption of this term into English without negative connotations is ironic;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/29/comment|title=Down with meritocracy|last=Young|first=Michael|date=28 June 2001|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young was concerned that the [[Tripartite System]] of education being practiced in the United Kingdom at the time he wrote the essay considered merit to be "intelligence-plus-effort, its possessors ... identified at an early age and selected for appropriate intensive education" and that the "obsession with quantification, test-scoring, and qualifications" it supported would create an educated middle-class elite at the expense of the education of the working class, inevitably resulting in injustice and – eventually – revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Todd|first=D. D.|date=1 December 1984|title=The Fontana Dictionary of Modern ThoughtBullockAllan and StallybrassOliver, editors London: Fontana/Collins, 1978. Pp. xix, 684. $12.95 C.F|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/dialogue-canadian-philosophical-review-revue-canadienne-de-philosophie/article/div-classtitlethe-fontana-dictionary-of-modern-thoughtbullockallan-and-stallybrassoliver-editors-london-fontanacollins-1978-pp-xix-684-1295-cfdiv/BDA69DAB300AC76916E24D3B6497DDC6|journal=Dialogue: Canadian Philosophical Review / Revue Canadienne de Philosophie|volume=23|issue=4|pages=738–740|doi=10.1017/S0012217300046461|issn=1759-0949}}&lt;/ref&gt; A modern representation of the sort of "meritocracy" Young feared may be seen in the series ''[[3%]]''.

Although merit matters to some degree in many societies, research shows that the distribution of resources in societies often follows hierarchical social categorizations of persons to a degree too significant to warrant calling these societies "meritocratic", since even exceptional intelligence, talent, or other forms of merit may not be compensatory for the social disadvantages people face. In many cases, social inequality is linked to [[#Racial and ethnic inequality|racial inequality]], [[ethnicity|ethnic inequality]], and [[gender inequality]], as well as other social statuses and these forms can be related to corruption.&lt;ref name="AP-20140127"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rugaber |first1=Christopher S. |last2=Boak |first2=Josh |title=Wealth gap: A guide to what it is, why it matters |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20140127/DABJ40P00.html |date=27 January 2014 |work=[[AP News]] |accessdate=27 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common metric for comparing social inequality in different nations is the [[Gini coefficient]], which measures the concentration of wealth and income in a nation from 0 (evenly distributed wealth and income) to 1 (one person has all wealth and income). Two nations may have identical Gini coefficients but dramatically different economic ([[Gross domestic product|output]]) and/or [[quality of life]], so the Gini coefficient must be contextualized for meaningful comparisons to be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/global/hdr2010/chapters|title=Reports {{!}} Human Development Reports|website=hdr.undp.org|language=en|access-date=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Social inequality is found in almost every society. Social inequality is shaped by a range of structural factors, such as geographical location or citizenship status, and are often underpinned by cultural discourses and identities defining, for example, whether the poor are 'deserving' or 'undeserving'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New Dimensions of Social Inequality|url = http://www.ceelbas.ac.uk/research/socialinequality|website = www.ceelbas.ac.uk|accessdate = 22 September 2015|last = Walker|publisher = |first = Dr. Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; In simple societies, those that have few social roles and statuses occupied by its members, social inequality may be very low. In [[tribal]] societies, for example, a tribal head or chieftain may hold some privileges, use some tools, or wear marks of office to which others do not have access, but the daily life of the chieftain is very much like the daily life of any other tribal member. [[Anthropologist]]s identify such highly egalitarian cultures as "[[kinship]]-oriented", which appear to value social harmony more than wealth or status. These cultures are contrasted with materially oriented cultures in which status and wealth are prized and competition and conflict are common. Kinship-oriented cultures may actively work to prevent [[Dominance hierarchy|social hierarchies]] from developing because they believe that could lead to conflict and instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gender and Rural Development | publisher=LIT Verlag Münster | author=Deji, Olanike F. | year=2011 | location=London | page=93 | isbn=978-3643901033}}&lt;/ref&gt; In today's world, most of our population lives in more complex than simple societies. As [[social complexity]] increases, inequality tends to increase along with a widening gap between the poorest and the most wealthy members of society.&lt;ref name="AP-20140127"/&gt;

Social inequality can be classified into egalitarian societies, ranked society, and stratified society.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic inequality in the United States|last=Osberg|first=L.|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egalitarian societies are those communities advocating for social equality through equal opportunities and rights hence no discrimination. People with special skills were not viewed as superior compared to the rest. The leaders do not have the power they only have influence. The norms and the beliefs the egalitarian society holds are for sharing equally and equal participation. Simply there are no classes. Ranked society mostly is agricultural communities who hierarchically grouped from the chief who is viewed to have a status in the society. In this society, people are clustered regarding status and prestige and not by access to power and resources. The chief is the most influential person followed by his family and relative, and those further related to him are less ranked. Stratified society is societies which horizontally ranked into the upper class, middle class, and lower class. The classification is regarding wealth, power, and prestige. The upper class are mostly the leaders and are the most influential in the society. It's possible for a person in the society to move from one stratum to the other. The social status is also hereditable from one generation to the next.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are five systems/types of social inequality which include wealth inequality, treatment and responsibility inequality, political inequality, life inequality, and membership inequality. Political inequality is the difference brought about by the ability to access federal resources which therefore have no civic equality. In treatment and responsibility difference some people are more benefited and can quickly receive more privileged than others. In working stations, some are given more responsibilities and hence better compensations and more benefits than the rest even when equally qualified. Membership inequality this is the number of members in a family, nation or of faith. Life inequality is brought about by the disparity of opportunities if presented they improves a person life quality. Finally, the income and wealth inequality is the disparity due to what an individual can earn on a daily basis contributing to their total revenue either monthly or yearly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The major examples of social inequality include income gap, gender inequality, health care, and social class. In health care, some individuals receive better and more professional care compared to others. They are also expected to pay more for these services. Social class differential comes evident during the public gathering where upper-class people given the best places to seat, the hospitality they receive and the first priorities they receive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Status in society is of two types which are [[Ascribed status|ascribed characteristics]] and [[achieved status|achieved characteristics]]. Ascribed characteristics are those present at birth or assigned by others and over which an individual has little or no control. Examples include sex, skin colour, eye shape, place of birth, sexuality, gender identity, parentage and social status of parents. Achieved characteristics are those which we earn or choose; examples include level of education, marital status, leadership status and other measures of [[Meritocracy|merit]]. In most societies, an individual's social status is a combination of ascribed and achieved factors. In some societies, however, only ascribed statuses are considered in determining one's social status and there exists little to no [[social mobility]] and, therefore, few paths to more social equality.&lt;ref name="Sernau13"&gt;{{cite book|title=Social Inequality in a Global Age (4th edition)|publisher=Sage|year=2013|isbn=978-1452205403|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|author=Sernau, Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of social inequality is generally referred to as [[caste|caste inequality]].

One's social location in a society's overall structure of [[social stratification]] affects and is affected by almost every aspect of social life and one's [[life chances]].&lt;ref name="Neckerman"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Inequality: Causes and Consequences |author1=Neckerman, Kathryn M.  |author2=Florencia Torche  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=Annual Review of Sociology | year=2007 | volume=33 | pages=335–357 | doi= 10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131755| jstor=29737766}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single best [[Dependent and independent variables|predictor]] of an individual's future social status is the social status into which they were born. Theoretical approaches to explaining social inequality concentrate on questions about how such [[social differentiation]]s arise, what types of resources are being allocated (for example, reserves versus resources),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cullati|first=Stéphane|last2=Kliegel|first2=Matthias|last3=Widmer|first3=Eric|date=2018-07-30|title=Development of reserves over the life course and onset of vulnerability in later life|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|language=En|volume=2|issue=8|pages=551–558|doi=10.1038/s41562-018-0395-3|issn=2397-3374}}&lt;/ref&gt; what are the roles of human [[cooperation]] and [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] in allocating resources, and how do these differing types and forms of inequality affect the overall functioning of a society?

The variables considered most important in explaining inequality and the manner in which those variables combine to produce the inequities and their social consequences in a given society can change across time and place. In addition to interest in comparing and contrasting social inequality at local and national levels, in the wake of today's [[globalization|globalizing]] processes, the most interesting question becomes: what does inequality look like on a worldwide scale and what does such global inequality bode for the future? In effect, globalization reduces the distances of time and space, producing a global interaction of cultures and societies and social roles that can increase global inequities.&lt;ref name="Sernau13" /&gt;

==Inequality and ideology==
Philosophical questions about social [[ethics]] and the desirability or inevitability of inequality in human societies have given rise to a spate of [[ideologies]] to address such questions.&lt;ref name="George90"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ideology and Social Welfare (2nd edition) | publisher=Routledge |author1=George, Victor  |author2=Paul Wilding  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=1990 | isbn=978-0415051019}}&lt;/ref&gt; We can broadly classify these ideologies on the basis of whether they justify or [[Legitimation|legitimize]] inequality, casting it as desirable or inevitable, or whether they cast equality as desirable and inequality as a feature of society to be reduced or eliminated. One end of this ideological [[Continuum (measurement)|continuum]] can be called "[[Individualist]]", the other "[[Collectivism|Collectivist]]".&lt;ref name="George90" /&gt; In Western societies, there is a long history associated with the idea of individual ownership of [[private property|property]] and [[economic liberalism]], the ideological belief in organizing the economy on individualist lines such that the greatest possible number of economic decisions are made by individuals and not by collective institutions or organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Political Ideology Today | publisher=Manchester University Press | author=Adams, Ian | year=2001 | location=Manchester | isbn=978-0719060205}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laissez-faire]], [[free market]] ideologies—including [[classical liberalism]], [[neoliberalism]], and [[libertarianism]]—are formed around the idea that social inequality is a "natural" feature of societies, is therefore inevitable and, in some philosophies, even desirable. Inequality provides for differing goods and services to be offered on the open [[Market (economics)|market]], spurs ambition, and provides incentive for industriousness and [[innovation]]. At the other end of the continuum, collectivists place little to no trust in "free market" economic systems, noting widespread lack of access among specific groups or classes of individuals to the costs of entry to the market. Widespread inequalities often lead to [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] and dissatisfaction with the current social order. Such ideologies include [[Fabian society|Fabianism]] and [[socialism]]. Inequality, in these ideologies, must be reduced, eliminated, or kept under tight control through collective regulation.&lt;ref name="George90" /&gt; Furthermore, in some views inequality is natural but shouldn't affect certain [[fundamental human needs]], [[human rights]] and the initial chances given to individuals (e.g. by [[education]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kolnai|first1=Aurel|title=Privilege and Liberty and Other Essays in Political Philosophy|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739100776|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OcFDFLcXLdkC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is out of proportions due to various problematic systemic structures.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Though the above discussion is limited to specific Western ideologies, it should be noted that similar thinking can be found, historically, in differing societies throughout the world. While, in general, eastern societies tend toward collectivism, elements of individualism and free market organization can be found in certain regions and historical eras. Classic Chinese society in the [[Han dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang dynasties]], for example, while highly organized into tight hierarchies of [[horizontal inequality]] with a distinct power elite also had many elements of free trade among its various regions and subcultures.&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey, Patricia Buckley Anne Walthall, James Palais. (2006). ''East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History.'' Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social mobility]] is the movement along social strata or hierarchies by individuals, [[ethnic group]], or nations. There is a change in literacy, [[income distribution]], education and health status. The movement can be vertical or horizontal. Vertical is the upward or downward movement along social strata which occurs due to change of jobs or marriage. Horizontal movement along levels that are equally ranked. Intra-generational mobility is a social status change in a generation (single lifetime). For example, a person moves from a junior staff in an organization to the [[senior management]]. The absolute management movement is where a person gains better social status than their parents, and this can be due to improved security, economic development, and better education system.  Relative mobility is where some individual are expected to have higher social ranks than their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Climbing Mount Laurel: The struggle for affordable housing and social mobility in an American suburb|last=Massey, D.

Today, there is belief held by some that social inequality often creates political conflict and growing consensus that political structures determine the solution for such conflicts. Under this line of thinking, adequately designed social and political institutions are seen as ensuring the smooth functioning of [[Market (economics)|economic markets]] such that there is political stability, which improves the long-term outlook, enhances labour and capital productivity and so stimulates [[economic growth]]. With higher economic growth, net gains are positive across all levels and political reforms are easier to sustain. This may explain why, over time, in more egalitarian societies fiscal performance is better, stimulating greater accumulation of capital and higher growth.&lt;ref name="Davtyan"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/ira/wpaper/201405.html | title=Interrelation among Economic Growth, Income Inequality, and Fiscal Performance: Evidence from Anglo-Saxon Countries | publisher=Regional Quantitative Analysis Research Group | website=Research Institute of Applied Economics Working Paper 2014/05 | date=2014 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Davtyan, Karen | pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inequality and social class==
{{Main article|Social class}}

[[Socioeconomic status]] (SES) is a combined total measure of a person's work experience and of an individual's or family's economic and social position in relation to others, based on income, education, and occupation. It is often used as synonymous with social class, a set of hierarchical social categories that indicate an individual's or household's relative position in a stratified matrix of social relationships. Social class is delineated by a number of variables, some of which change across time and place. For [[Karl Marx]], there exist two major social classes with significant inequality between the two. The two are delineated by their relationship to the [[means of production]] in a given society. Those two classes are defined as the owners of the means of production and those who sell their labour to the owners of the means of production. In capitalistic societies, the two classifications represent the opposing social interests of its members, capital gain for the capitalists and good wages for the labourers, creating [[social conflict]].

[[Max Weber]] uses social classes to examine wealth and status. For him, social class is strongly associated with prestige and privileges. It may explain social reproduction, the tendency of social classes to remain stable across generations maintaining most of their inequalities as well. Such inequalities include differences in income, wealth, access to education, pension levels, social status, socioeconomic safety-net.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph. 2012. The Price of Inequality. New York, NY: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, social class can be defined as a large category of similarly ranked people located in a hierarchy and distinguished from other large categories in the hierarchy by such traits as occupation, education, income, and wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Dennis. 2011: The American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality, 8th ed. Thousand Oaks, CA: Pine Forge Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[Western culture|Western societies]], inequalities are often broadly classified into three major divisions of social class: [[upper class]], [[middle class]], and [[Working class|lower class]]. Each of these classes can be further subdivided into smaller classes (e.g. "upper middle").&lt;ref name="Saunders1990"&gt;{{cite book | author-link=Peter Robert Saunders | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FK-004p0J_EC | title=Social Class and Stratification | publisher=Routledge | last=Saunders | first=Peter | year=1990 | isbn=978-0-415-04125-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of different classes have varied access to financial resources, which affects their placement in the [[social stratification]] system.&lt;ref name="Doob13"&gt;Doob, B. Christopher (2013). Social Inequality and [[Social Stratification]] in US Society (1st ed.). Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education. {{ISBN|0-205-79241-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Class,  race, and gender are forms of stratification that bring inequality and determines the difference in allocation of societal rewards. Occupation is the primary determinant of a person class since it affects their lifestyle, opportunities, culture, and kind of people one associates with. Class based families include the lower class who are the poor in the society. They have limited opportunities. Working class are those people in blue-collar jobs and usually, affects the economic level of a nation. The Middle classes are those who rely mostly on wives' employment and depends on credits from the bank and medical coverage. The upper middle class are professionals who are strong because of economic resources and supportive institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houkamau|first=C.A.|year=2015|title=Looking Māori predicts decreased rates of home ownership: Institutional racism in housing based on perceived appearance|url=|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=10|issue=3|pages=e0118540|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0118540|pmid=25738961|pmc=4349451}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the upper class usually are the wealthy families who have economic power due to accumulative wealth from families but not and not hard earned income.

[[Social stratification]] is the hierarchical arrangement of society about social class, wealth, political influence. A society can be politically stratified based on authority and power,  economically stratified based on income level and wealth, occupational stratification about one's occupation. Some roles for examples doctors, engineers, lawyers are highly ranked, and thus they give orders while the rest receive the orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Structure of social stratification in the United States|last=Beeghley|first=L.|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three systems of social stratification which are the caste system, estates system,  and class system. Castes system usually ascribed to children during birth whereby one receives the same stratification as of that of their parents. The caste system has been linked to religion and thus permanent. The stratification may be superior or inferior and thus influences the occupation and the social roles assigned to a person. Estate system is a state or society where people in this state were required to work on their land to receive some services like military protection. Communities ranked according to the nobility of their lords. The class system is about income inequality and socio-political status. People can move the classes when they increase their level of income or if they have authority. People are expected to maximize their innate abilities and possessions. Social stratification characteristics include its universal, social, ancient, it’s in diverse forms and also consequential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ideological support for the Indian caste system: Social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism and karma|last=Cotterill, S., Sidanius, J., Bhardwaj, A., &amp; Kumar, V.|publisher=Journal of Social and Political Psychology|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=98–116|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] variables most often used as an indicator of social inequality are [[income]] and [[wealth]]. In a given society, the distribution of individual or household accumulation of wealth tells us more about variation in [[well-being]] than does income, alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Who Rules America? The Triumph of the Corporate Rich | publisher=McGraw-Hill | author=Domhoff, G. William | year=2013 | page=288 | isbn=978-0078026713}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP), especially ''per capita'' GDP, is sometimes used to describe economic inequality at the [[International inequality|international]] or global level. A better measure at that level, however, is the [[Gini coefficient]], a [[Statistical dispersion#Measures of statistical dispersion|measure of statistical dispersion]] used to represent the distribution of a specific quantity, such as income or wealth, at a global level, among a nation's residents, or even within a metropolitan area.&lt;ref&gt;Gini, C. (1936). "On the Measure of Concentration with Special Reference to Income and Statistics", Colorado College Publication, General Series No. 208, 73–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Other widely used measures of economic inequality are the percentage of people living with under US$1.25 or $2 a day and the share of national income held by the wealthiest 10% of the population, sometimes called "the Palma" measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Is It All About the Tails? The Palma Measure of Income Inequality (Working Paper 343) | publisher=Centre for Global Development |author1=Cobham, Alex   |author2=Andy Sumner  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2013 | location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patterns of inequality==
There are a number of socially defined characteristics of individuals that contribute to social status and, therefore, equality or inequality within a society. When researchers use quantitative variables such as income or wealth to measure inequality, on an examination of the data, patterns are found that indicate these other social variables contribute to income or wealth as [[intervening variable]]s. Significant inequalities in income and wealth are found when specific socially defined categories of people are compared. Among the most pervasive of these variables are [[sex]]/[[gender]], [[Race (human classification)|race]], and ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Hill1998"&gt;{{cite book | title="Toward a new vision: race, class and gender as categories of analysis and connection" in Social Class and Stratification: Classic Statements and Theoretical Debates | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield | author=Collins, Patricia Hill | year=1998 | location=Boston | pages=231–247}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to say, in societies wherein merit is considered to be the primary factor determining one's place or rank in the social order, that merit has no effect on variations in income or wealth. It is to say that these other socially defined characteristics can, and often do, intervene in the [[Value theory|valuation]] of merit.

===Gender inequality===
Gender as a social inequality is whereby women and men are treated differently due to masculinity and femininity by dividing labor, assigning roles, and responsibilities and allocating social rewards. Sex- and gender-based [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]], called [[sexism]], are major contributing factors to social inequality. Most societies, even [[agrarian society|agricultural ones]], have some [[sexual division of labour]] and [[Occupational segregation#Gendered division of labour|gender-based division of labour]] tends to increase during industrialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=New Family Values: Liberty, Equality, Diversity | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield | author=Struening, Karen | year=2002 | location=New York | isbn=978-0-7425-1231-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis on gender inequality is born out of the deepening division in the [[Gender role|roles]] assigned to men and women, particularly in the economic, political and educational spheres. Women are underrepresented in political activities and decision making processes in most states in both the [[Global North]] and Global South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/daw/index.html |title=About us |publisher=Un.org |date=31 December 2003 |accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender discrimination, especially concerning the lower social status of women, has been a topic of serious discussion not only within academic and activist communities but also by governmental agencies and international bodies such as the [[United Nations]]. These discussions seek to identify and remedy widespread, institutionalized barriers to access for women in their societies. By making use of [[gender analysis]], researchers try to understand the social expectations, responsibilities, resources and priorities of women and men within a specific context, examining the social, economic and environmental factors which influence their roles and decision-making capacity. By enforcing artificial separations between the social and economic roles of men and women, the lives of women and girls are negatively impacted and this can have the effect of limiting social and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Issac Kwaka Acheampong  |author2=Sidharta Sarkar |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Gender, Poverty &amp; Sustainable Livelihood|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural ideals about [[women's work]] can also affect men whose outward [[gender expression]] is considered "feminine" within a given society. [[Transgender]] and [[gender-variant]] persons may express their gender through their appearance, the statements they make, or official documents they present. In this context, gender normativity, which is understood as the social expectations placed on us when we present particular bodies, produces widespread cultural/institutional devaluations of trans identities, homosexuality and femininity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=" Fugitive flesh: Gender self-determination, queer abolition, and trans resistance" in E.

A variety of [[global issue]]s like [[HIV/AIDS]], illiteracy, and [[poverty]] are often seen as "women's issues" since women are disproportionately affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Empowering Women as Key Change Agents|url=http://www.thp.org/what_we_do/program_overview/empowering_women?gclid=CIPt9L6X6KsCFUJ76wodFhJUKw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331234727/http://www.thp.org/what_we_do/program_overview/empowering_women?gclid=CIPt9L6X6KsCFUJ76wodFhJUKw|archivedate=31 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, women and girls face problems such as lack of access to education, which limit their opportunities to succeed, and further limits their ability to contribute economically to their society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Platform for Action|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/platform/poverty.htm|website=United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are underrepresented in political activities and decision making processes throughout most of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meeting the Needs of the World's Women|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/daw/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, around 20 percent of women were below the $1.25/day international poverty line and 40 percent below the $2/day mark.

Women's participation in work has been increasing globally, but women are still faced with wage discrepancies and differences compared to what men earn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women, Poverty &amp; Economics|url=http://www.unifem.org/gender_issues/women_poverty_economics/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is true globally even in the agricultural and rural sector in developed as well as developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN: Gender discrimination accounts for 90% of wage gap between men and women|url=http://pressroom.ipc-undp.org/2011/un-gender-discrimination-accounts-for-90-of-wage-gap-between-men-and-women/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403022719/http://pressroom.ipc-undp.org/2011/un-gender-discrimination-accounts-for-90-of-wage-gap-between-men-and-women/|archivedate=3 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structural impediments to women's ability to pursue and advance in their chosen professions often result in a phenomenon known as the [[glass ceiling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Glass Ceiling Effect|url=http://www.bsos.umd.edu/socy/vanneman/papers/CotterHOV01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to unseen - and often unacknowledged barriers that prevent minorities and women from rising to the upper rungs of the corporate ladder, regardless of their qualifications or achievements. This effect can be seen in the corporate and bureaucratic environments of many countries, lowering the chances of women to excel. It prevents women from succeeding and making the maximum use of their potential, which is at a cost for women as well as the society's development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Janet Henshall Momsen|title=Gender and Development|year=2004|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ensuring that [[women's rights]] are protected and endorsed can promote a sense of belonging that motivates women to contribute to their society.

Women and persons whose gender identity does not conform to [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] beliefs about sex (only male and female) continue to face violence on global domestic, interpersonal, institutional and administrative scales. While first-wave [[Liberal feminism|Liberal Feminist]] initiatives raised awareness about the lack of fundamental rights and freedoms that women have access to, second-wave feminism (see also [[Radical Feminism]]) highlighted the structural forces that underlie gender-based violence. [[Masculinities]] are generally constructed so as to subordinate femininities and other expressions of gender that are not heterosexual, assertive and dominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Connel|first=R.W.|title=Masculinities|year=1995 |origyear=2005|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520246980}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Gender sociologist and author, [[Raewyn Connell]], discusses in her 2009 book, Gender, how masculinity is dangerous, heterosexual, violent and authoritative. These structures of masculinity ultimately contribute to the vast amounts of gendered violence, marginalization and suppression that women, queer, transgender, gender variant and gender non-conforming persons face. 
Some scholars suggest that women's underrepresentation in political systems speaks the idea that "formal citizenship does not always imply full social membership".&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor 1993 p.504&lt;/ref&gt; Men, male bodies and expressions of masculinity are linked to ideas about work and citizenship. Others point out that patriarchal states tend top scale and claw back their social policies relative to the disadvantage of women.&lt;ref&gt;Mandel 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This process ensures that women encounter resistance into meaningful positions of power in institutions, administrations, and political systems and communities.

===Racial and ethnic inequality===
Racial or ethnic inequality is the result of hierarchical social distinctions between racial and ethnic categories within a society and often established based on characteristics such as skin color and other physical characteristics or an individual's place of origin or culture. Racism is whereby some races are more privileged and are allowed to venture into the labor market and are better compensated than others. Ethnicity is the privilege one enjoys for belonging to a particular ethnic group. Even though race has no biological connection, it has become a socially constructed category capable of restricting or enabling social status.

Racial inequality can also result in diminished opportunities for members of [[marginalized]] groups, which in turn can lead to [[Cycle of poverty|cycles of poverty]] and political marginalization. Racial and [[Ethnic group|ethnic categories]] become a [[Minority group|minority category]] in a society. Minority members in such a society are often subjected to discriminatory actions resulting from majority policies, including [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], exclusion, [[oppression]], [[exile|expulsion]], and [[genocide|extermination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Devising an Adequate System of Minority Protection: Individual Human Rights, Minority Rights and the Right to Self-Determination | publisher=Springer | author=Henrard, Kristen | year=2000 | location=New York | isbn=978-9041113597}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, during the run-up to the 2012 federal elections in the United States, legislation in certain "[[battleground states]]" that claimed to target voter fraud had the effect of disenfranchising tens of thousands of primarily African American voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alvarez|first=R.

In the United States, [[Angela Davis]] argues that [[Incarceration in the United States|mass incarceration]] has been a modern tool of the state to [[Race in the United States criminal justice system|impose inequality, repression, and discrimination]] upon African American and Hispanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Angela Y.|title=Abolition Democracy: Beyond Prisons, Torture, and Empire|publisher=Seven Stories|isbn=978-1583226957|page=160|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[War on Drugs]] has been a campaign with disparate effects, ensuring the constant incarceration of poor, vulnerable, and marginalized populations in North America. Over a million African Americans are incarcerated in the US, many of whom have been convicted of a non-violent drug possession charge.{{cn|date=November 2017}} With the States of Colorado and Washington having legalized the possession of marijuana, drug reformists and anti-war on drugs lobbyists are hopeful that drug issues will be interpreted and dealt with from a healthcare perspective instead of a matter of criminal law. In Canada, Aboriginal, First Nations, and Indigenous persons represent over a quarter of the federal prison population, even though they only represent 3% of the country's population.

===Age inequality===
[[Age discrimination]] is defined as the unfair treatment of people with regard to promotions, recruitment, resources, or privileges because of their age. It is also known as [[ageism]]: the stereotyping of and discrimination against individuals or groups based upon their age. It is a set of beliefs, attitudes, norms, and values used to justify age-based prejudice, discrimination, and subordination.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick, George R.; Katsiaficas, George N.; Kirkpatrick, Robert George; Mary Lou Emery (1987). Introduction to critical sociology. Ardent Media. p. 261. {{ISBN|978-0-8290-1595-9}}. Retrieved 28 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; One form of ageism is [[adultism]], which is the discrimination against children and people under the legal adult age.&lt;ref&gt;Lauter And Howe (1971) Conspiracy of the Young. Meridian Press.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of an act of adultism might be the policy of a certain establishment, restaurant, or place of business to not allow those under the legal adult age to enter their premises after a certain time or at all. While some people may benefit or enjoy these practices, some find them offensive and discriminatory. Discrimination against those under the age of 40 however is not illegal under the current U.S. Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/age.cfm | title=Age Discrimination}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As implied in the definitions above, treating people differently based upon their age is not necessarily discrimination. Virtually every society has [[Age stratification|age-stratification]], meaning that the age structure in a society changes as people begin to live longer and the [[Population ageing|population becomes older]]. In most cultures, there are different social role expectations for people of different ages to perform. Every society manages people's ageing by allocating certain roles for different age groups. Age discrimination primarily occurs when age is used as an unfair criterion for allocating more or less resources. Scholars of age inequality have suggested that certain social organizations favor particular age inequalities. For instance, because of their emphasis on training and maintaining productive citizens, modern capitalist societies may dedicate disproportionate resources to training the young and maintaining the middle-aged worker to the detriment of the elderly and the retired (especially those already disadvantaged by income/wealth inequality).&lt;ref name="Sargeant11"&gt;{{cite book | title=Age Discrimination and Diversity Multiple Discrimination from an Age Perspective | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Sargeant, Malcolm (ed.) | year=2011 | isbn=978-1107003774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern, technologically advanced societies, there is a tendency for both the young and the old to be relatively disadvantaged. However, more recently, in the United States the tendency is for the young to be most disadvantaged. For example, [[Poverty in the United States|poverty levels in the U.S.]] have been decreasing among people aged 65 and older since the early 1970s whereas the number children under 18 in poverty has steadily risen.&lt;ref name="Sargeant11"/&gt; Sometimes, the elderly have had the opportunity to build their wealth throughout their lives, younger people have the disadvantage of recently entering into or having not yet entered into the economic sphere. The larger contributor to this, however is the increase in the number of people over 65 receiving [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] benefits in the U.S.

When we compare income distribution among youth across the globe, we find that about half (48.5 percent) of the world's young people are confined to the bottom two income brackets as of 2007. This means that, out of the three billion persons under the age of 24 in the world as of 2007, approximately 1.5 billion were living in situations in which they and their families had access to just nine percent of global income. Moving up the income distribution ladder, children and youth do not fare much better: more than two-thirds of the world's youth have access to less than 20 percent of global wealth, with 86 percent of all young people living on about one-third of world income. For the just over 400 million youth who are fortunate enough to rank among families or situations at the top of the income distribution, however, opportunities improve greatly with more than 60 percent of global income within their reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unicef.org/socialpolicy/index_58230.html | title=Global inequality:  Beyond the bottom billion | publisher=UNICEF | website=UNICEF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC POLICY WORKING PAPER | date=April 2011 | accessdate=9 July 2014 |author1=Ortiz, Isabel  |author2=Matthew Cummins |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this does not exhaust the scope of age discrimination, in modern societies it is often discussed primarily with regards to the work environment. Indeed, non-participation in the labour force and the unequal access to rewarding jobs means that the elderly and the young are often subject to unfair disadvantages because of their age. On the one hand, the elderly are less likely to be involved in the workforce: At the same time, old age may or may not put one at a disadvantage in accessing positions of prestige. Old age may benefit one in such positions, but it may also disadvantage one because of negative ageist stereotyping of old people. On the other hand, young people are often disadvantaged from accessing prestigious or relatively rewarding jobs, because of their recent entry to the work force or because they are still completing their education. Typically, once they enter the labour force or take a part-time job while in school, they start at entry level positions with low level wages. Furthermore, because of their lack of prior work experience, they can also often be forced to take marginal jobs, where they can be taken advantage of by their employers. As a result, many older people have to face obstacles in their lives.

===Inequalities in health===
{{further information|Health equity|Inequality in disease|Social determinants of health in poverty|Diseases of poverty}}
Health inequalities can be defined as differences in health status or in the distribution of health determinants between different population groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Health Impact Assessment: Glossary of Terms Used|url=http://www.who.int/hia/about/glos/en/index1.html|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Health care====
Health inequalities are in many cases related to access to health care. In [[industrialized nations]], health inequalities are most prevalent in countries that have not implemented a [[universal health care]] system, such as the United States. Because the US health care system is heavily privatized, access to health care is dependent upon one's [[economic capital]]; Health care is not a right, it is a commodity that can be purchased through private insurance companies (or that is sometimes provided through an employer). The way health care is organized in the U.S. contributes to health inequalities based on gender, [[socioeconomic status]] and race/ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Eric R.|author2=Perry, Brea L. |title=Medical Sociology and Health Services Research: Past Accomplishments and Future Policy Challenges|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behaviour|year=2010|pages=107–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Wright and Perry assert, "social status differences in health care are a primary mechanism of health inequalities". In the United States, over 48 million people are without medical care coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Census|url=https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/hlthins/data/incpovhlth/2011/highlights.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that almost one sixth of the population is without health insurance, mostly people belonging to the lower classes of society.

While universal access to health care may not completely eliminate health inequalities,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guessous|first=I.|last2=Gaspoz|first2=J.M.|last3=Theler|first3=J.M.|last4=Wolff|first4=H.|date=2012-11|title=High prevalence of forgoing healthcare for economic reasons in Switzerland: A population-based study in a region with universal health insurance coverage|journal=Preventive Medicine|volume=55|issue=5|pages=521–527|doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2012.08.005|pmid=22940614|issn=0091-7435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guessous|first=Idris|last2=Luthi|first2=Jean-Christophe|last3=Bowling|first3=Christopher Barrett|last4=Theler|first4=Jean-Marc|last5=Paccaud|first5=Fred|last6=Gaspoz|first6=Jean-Michel|last7=McClellan|first7=William|date=2014|title=Prevalence of Frailty Indicators and Association with Socioeconomic Status in Middle-Aged and Older Adults in a Swiss Region with Universal Health Insurance Coverage: A Population-Based Cross-Sectional Study|journal=Journal of Aging Research|language=en|volume=2014|pages=1–8|doi=10.1155/2014/198603|issn=2090-2204|pmc=4227447|pmid=25405033}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been shown that it greatly reduces them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veugeulers|first=P|author2=Yip, A. |title=Socioeconomic Disparities in Health Care Use: Does Universal Coverage Reduce Inequalities in Health?|journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health|year=2003|volume=57|issue=6|pages=107–119|doi=10.1136/jech.57.6.424|pmid=12775787|pmc=1732477}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, privatization gives individuals the 'power' to purchase their own health care (through private health insurance companies), but this leads to social inequality by only allowing people who have economic resources to access health care. Citizens are seen as consumers who have a 'choice' to buy the best health care they can afford; in alignment with neoliberal ideology, this puts the burden on the individual rather than the government or the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hacker|first=Jacob S.|title=The Great Risk Shift: The Assault on American Jobs, Families, Health Care, and Retirement - and How You Can Fight Back|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries that have a universal health care system, health inequalities have been reduced. In Canada, for example, equity in the availability of health services has been improved dramatically through [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]]. People don't have to worry about how they will pay health care, or rely on emergency rooms for care, since health care is provided for the entire population. However, inequality issues still remain. For example, not everyone has the same level of access to services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Karen R.|title=Health and Health Care in Essentials of Contemporary Sociology|year=1994|publisher=Copp Clark Longman|location=Toronto|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Inequalities in health are not, however, only related to access to health care. Even if everyone had the same level of access, inequalities may still remain. This is because health status is a product of more than just how much medical care people have available to them. While Medicare has equalized access to health care by removing the need for direct payments at the time of services, which improved the health of low status people, inequities in health are still prevalent in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=K.R.|title=The Inverse Care Law in Canada: Differential Access Under Universal Free Health Insurance|year=1998|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=Toronto|pages=118–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be due to the state of the current social system, which bear other types of inequalities such as economic, racial and gender inequality.

A lack of health equity is also evident in the developing world, where the importance of equitable access to healthcare has been cited as crucial to achieving many of the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. Health inequalities can vary greatly depending on the country one is looking at. Health equity is needed in order to live a healthier and more sufficient life within society. Inequalities in health lead to substantial effects, that is burdensome or the entire society. Inequalities in health are often associated with socioeconomic status and access to health care. Health inequities can occur when the distribution of public health services is unequal. For example, in Indonesia in 1990, only 12% of government spending for health was for services consumed by the poorest 20% of households, while the wealthiest 20% consumed 29% of the government subsidy in the health sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=World Bank|title=World Development Report|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to health care is heavily influenced by socioeconomic status as well, as wealthier population groups have a higher probability of obtaining care when they need it. A study by Makinen et al. (2000) found that in the majority of developing countries they looked at, there was an upward trend by [[Quantile|quintile]] in health care use for those reporting illness. Wealthier groups are also more likely to be seen by doctors and to receive medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?pid=S0042-96862000000100006&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=pt | title=Inequalities in Health Care Use and Expenditures: Empirical Data from Eight Developing Countries and Countries in Transition | journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume=78 | issue=1 | pages=55–65 | date=January 2000 | last=Mankinen, M.| doi=10.1590/S0042-96862000000100006| pmid=10686733 | pmc=2560608 |display-authors=etal| doi-broken-date=2018-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Food====
There has been considerable research in recent years regarding a phenomenon known as [[food desert]]s, in which low access to fresh, healthy food in a neighborhood leads to poor consumer choices and options regarding diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USDA Defines Food Deserts|url=http://americannutritionassociation.org/newsletter/usda-defines-food-deserts|website=American Nutrition Association|publisher=American Nutrition Association|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely thought that food deserts are significant contributors to the childhood obesity epidemic in the United States and many other countries.

The economies of the world have [[Development theory|developed]] unevenly, historically, such that entire geographical regions were left mired in poverty and disease while others began to reduce poverty and disease on a wholesale basis. This was represented by a type of [[North–South divide]] that existed after [[World War II]] between [[First world]], more [[developed country|developed]], [[industrialized]], wealthy countries and [[Third world]] countries, primarily as measured by GDP. From around 1980, however, through at least 2011, the GDP gap, while still wide, appeared to be closing and, in some more rapidly [[developing countries]], [[life expectancies]] began to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24835822 | title=How much do you know about the world? | publisher=BBC | date=2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Rosling, Hans| work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are numerous limitations of GDP as an economic indicator of social "well-being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neweconomyworkinggroup.org/visions/living-wealth-indicators/gdp-flawed-measure-progress | title=GDP: A Flawed Measure of Progress | publisher=New Economy Working Group | accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If we look at the Gini coefficient for world income, over time, after [[World War II]] the global Gini coefficient sat at just under .45. Between around 1959 to 1966, the global Gini increased sharply, to a peak of around .48 in 1966. After falling and leveling off a couple of times during a period from around 1967 to 1984, the Gini began to climb again in the mid-eighties until reaching a high or around .54 in 2000 then jumped again to around .70 in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Two Faces of Globalization | author=Bronko, Milanovic | journal=World Development | year=2003 | volume=31 | issue=4 | pages=667–683 | doi=10.1016/s0305-750x(03)00002-0| citeseerx=10.1.1.454.7785 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1980s, the gap between some regions has markedly narrowed— between Asia and the advanced economies of the West, for example—but huge gaps remain globally. Overall equality across humanity, considered as individuals, has improved very little. Within the decade between 2003 and 2013, income inequality grew even in traditionally egalitarian countries like Germany, Sweden and Denmark. With a few exceptions—France, Japan, Spain—the top 10 percent of earners in most advanced economies raced ahead, while the bottom 10 percent fell further behind.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/inequality-is-a-choice/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0 | title=Inequality is a Choice | date=13 October 2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Stiglits Joseph E. | location=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013, a tiny elite of multibillionaires, 85 to be exact, had amassed wealth equivalent to all the wealth owned by the poorest half (3.5 billion) of the world's total population of 7 billion.&lt;ref name="WEF2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GAC_GlobalAgendaOutlook_2014.pdf | title=Outlook on the Global Agenda 2014 | publisher=World Economic Forum | accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Country of citizenship (an [[ascribed status]] characteristic) explains 60% of variability in global income; citizenship and parental income class (both ascribed status characteristics) combined explain more than 80% of income variability.&lt;ref name="Milanovic2011" /&gt;

==Inequality and economic growth==
[[File:Berg Ostry 2011 Chart 4.gif|thumb|left|Of the factors influencing the duration of [[economic growth]] in both developed and developing countries, [[Economic inequality|income equality]] has a more beneficial impact than trade openness, sound political institutions, and foreign investment.&lt;ref name=BergOstryEE&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Berg |first= Andrew G. |last2= Ostry |first2= Jonathan D. |year= 2011 |title= Equality and Efficiency |journal= Finance and Development |volume= 48 |issue= 3 |url= http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2011/09/berg.htm |accessdate= 10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The concept of [[economic growth]] is fundamental in [[capitalist]] economies. [[Productivity]] must grow as population grows and capital must grow to feed into increased productivity. Investment of capital leads to [[returns on investment]] (ROI) and increased [[capital accumulation]]. The hypothesis that economic inequality is a necessary precondition for economic growth has been a mainstay of liberal economic theory. Recent research, particularly over the first two decades of the 21st century, has called this basic assumption into question.&lt;ref name="UNICEF2011" /&gt; While growing inequality does have a positive correlation with economic growth under specific sets of conditions, inequality in general is not positively correlated with economic growth and, under some conditions, shows a negative correlation with economic growth.&lt;ref name="Davtyan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNICEF2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milanovic2011"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ub.edu/histeco/pdf/milanovic.pdf | title=Global income inequality: the past two centuries and implications for 21st century | publisher=World Bank | date=Autumn 2011 | accessdate=10 July 2014 | author=Milanovic, Branko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ostry2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=41291 | title=Redistribution, Inequality, and Growth | publisher=International Monetary Fund | date=April 2014 | accessdate=10 July 2014 | author=Ostry, Jonathan D. and Andrew Berg, Charalambos G. Tsangarides}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milanovic (2011) points out that overall, global inequality between countries is more important to growth of the world economy than inequality within countries.&lt;ref name="Milanovic2011" /&gt; While global economic growth may be a policy priority, recent evidence about regional and national inequalities cannot be dismissed when more local economic growth is a policy objective. The recent [[financial crisis]] and [[global recession]] hit countries and shook [[Global financial system|financial systems all over the world]]. This led to the implementation of large-scale fiscal expansionary interventions and, as a result, to massive public debt issuance in some countries. Governmental bailouts of the banking system further burdened fiscal balances and raises considerable concern about the fiscal solvency of some countries. Most governments want to keep deficits under control but rolling back the expansionary measures or cutting spending and raising taxes implies an enormous wealth transfer from tax payers to the private financial sector. Expansionary fiscal policies shift resources and causes worries about growing inequality within countries. Moreover, recent data confirm an ongoing trend of increasing income inequality since the early nineties. Increasing inequality within countries has been accompanied by a redistribution of economic resources between developed economies and emerging markets.&lt;ref name="Davtyan" /&gt; Davtyn, et al. (2014) studied the interaction of these fiscal conditions and changes in fiscal and economic policies with income inequality in the UK, Canada, and the US. They find income inequality has negative effect on economic growth in the case of the UK but a positive effect in the cases of the US and Canada. Income inequality generally reduces government net lending/borrowing for all the countries. Economic growth, they find, leads to an increase of income inequality in the case of the UK and to the decline of inequality in the cases of the US and Canada. At the same time, economic growth improves government net lending/borrowing in all the countries. Government spending leads to the decline in inequality in the UK but to its increase in the US and Canada.&lt;ref name="Davtyan" /&gt;

Following the results of Alesina and Rodrick (1994), Bourguignon (2004), and Birdsall (2005) show that developing countries with high inequality tend to grow more slowly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Distributive Politics and Economic Growth |author1=Alesina, A.  |author2=D.

For 131 countries for which they could estimate the change in Gini index values between 1990 and 2008, they find that those countries that increased levels of inequality experienced slower annual per capita GDP growth over the same time period. Noting a lack of data for national wealth, they build an index using ''[[Forbes]]'' list of billionaires by country normalized by GDP and validated through correlation with a Gini coefficient for wealth and the share of wealth going to the top decile. They find that many countries generating low rates of economic growth are also characterized by a high level of wealth inequality with wealth concentration among a class of entrenched elites. They conclude that extreme inequality in the distribution of wealth globally, regionally and nationally, coupled with the negative effects of higher levels of income disparities, should make us question current economic development approaches and examine the need to place equity at the center of the development agenda.&lt;ref name="UNICEF2011" /&gt;

Ostry, et al. (2014) reject the hypothesis that there is a major trade-off between a reduction of income inequality (through [[Redistribution (economics)|income redistribution]]) and economic growth. If that were the case, they hold, then redistribution that reduces income inequality would on average be bad for growth, taking into account both the direct effect of higher redistribution and the effect of the resulting lower inequality. Their research shows rather the opposite: increasing income inequality always has a significant and, in most cases, negative effect on economic growth while redistribution has an overall pro-growth effect (in one sample) or no growth effect. Their conclusion is that increasing inequality, particularly when inequality is already high, results in low growth, if any, and such growth may be unsustainable over long periods.

Piketty and Saez (2014) note that there are important differences between income and wealth inequality dynamics. First, wealth concentration is always much higher than income concentration. The top 10 percent of wealth share typically falls in the 60 to 90 percent range of all wealth, whereas the top 10 percent income share is in the 30 to 50 percent range. The bottom 50 percent wealth share is always less than 5 percent, whereas the bottom 50 percent income share generally falls in the 20 to 30 percent range. The bottom half of the population hardly owns any wealth, but it does earn appreciable income:The inequality of labor income can be high, but it is usually much less extreme. On average, members of the bottom half of the population, in terms of wealth, own less than one-tenth of the average wealth. The inequality of labor income can be high, but it is usually much less extreme. Members of the bottom half of the population in income earn about half the average income. In sum, the concentration of capital ownership is always extreme, so that the very notion of capital is fairly abstract for large segments—if not the majority—of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Inequality in the long run | journal=Science | year=2014 | volume=344 | issue=6186 | pages=838–43 | doi=10.1126/science.1251936 | pmid=24855258 | last1 = Piketty | first1 = T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piketty (2014) finds that wealth-income ratios, today, seem to be returning to very high levels in low economic growth countries, similar to what he calls the "classic patrimonial" wealth-based societies of the 19th century wherein a minority lives off its wealth while the rest of the population works for subsistence living. He surmises that wealth accumulation is high because growth is low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Capital in the 21st century | publisher=Belknap Press | author=Piketty, Thomas | year=2014 | isbn=978-0674430006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monroe doctrine.jpg|thumb|A 1912 newspaper cartoon highlighting the [[United States]]' influence in [[Latin America]] following the [[Monroe Doctrine]].]]

In the field of [[international relations]], a '''sphere of influence''' ('''SOI''') is a spatial region or concept division over which a state or organization has a level of cultural, economic, military, or political exclusivity, accommodating to the interests of powers outside the borders of the state that controls it.

While there may be a formal alliance or other treaty obligations between the influenced and influencer, such formal arrangements are not necessary and the influence can often be more of an example of [[soft power]]. Similarly, a formal alliance does not necessarily mean that one country lies within another's sphere of influence. High levels of exclusivity have historically been associated with higher levels of conflict.

In more extreme cases, a country within the "sphere of influence" of another may become a subsidiary of that state and serve in effect as a satellite state or de facto colony. The system of spheres of influence by which powerful nations intervene in the affairs of others continues to the present. It is often analyzed in terms of [[superpower]]s, [[great power]]s, and/or [[middle power]]s.

Sometimes portions of a single country can fall into two distinct spheres of influence. In the colonial era the [[buffer state]]s of [[Iran]] and [[Thailand]], lying between the empires of [[United Kingdom|Britain]]/[[Russia]] and Britain/[[France]] respectively, were divided between the spheres of influence of the imperial [[power (international)|powers]]. Likewise, after [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], [[Germany]] was divided into four [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation zones]], which later consolidated into [[West Germany]] and [[East Germany]], the former a member of NATO and the latter a member of the [[Warsaw Pact]].

The term is also used to describe non-political situations, e.g., a [[shopping mall]] is said to have a sphere of influence which designates the geographical area where it dominates the [[retail trade]].

==Historical remnants==
[[File:Map of colonial Africa in 1897.jpg|thumbnail|right|A map of colonial Africa in 1897 showing the European "sphere[s] of influence".]]
Many areas of the world are considered to have inherited culture from a previous sphere of influence, that while perhaps today halted, continues to share the same culture. Examples include the [[Anglosphere]], [[Arab World]], [[Eurosphere]], [[Francophonie]], [[Françafrique]], [[Germanic languages|Germanosphere]], [[Greater India|Indosphere]], [[Legacy of the Roman Empire|Latin Europe]]/[[Latin America]], [[Lusophone|Lusophonie]], [[Pan-Turkism|Turkosphere]],  [[Chinese cultural sphere]], [[Slavisphere]], [[Hispanophone]], [[Malay World]], as well as many others.

==New Imperialism era==
An example of spheres of influence was China in the late 19th and early 20th Century, when Britain, France, Germany, and Russia (later replaced by Japan) had de facto control over large swaths of territory.  These were taken by means of military attacks or threats to force Chinese authorities to sign [[unequal treaty|unequal treaties]] and very long term "leases".&lt;ref&gt;[http://historyworldsome.blogspot.com/2013/12/spheres-of-influence-in-china.html Spheres of Influence in China ]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Spheres of influence new.png|thumb|Approximate demarcation of spheres of influence, post-1905, when [[Russo-Japanese War|Japan seized portions of the Russian sphere]]]]
In December 1897 German [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] declared his intent to seize territory in China, precipitating the scramble to demarcate zones of influence in China. The German government acquired, in [[Shandong]] province, exclusive control over developmental loans, mining, and railway ownership,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jeans |first1=Roger B. |title=Democracy and Socialism in Republican China: The Politics of Zhang Junmai (Carsun Chang), 1906-1941 |date=1997 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=0847687074 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Russia gained, in addition to the previous tax exemption for trade in [[Mongolia]] and [[Xinjiang]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paine|first=S.

Sharpe|isbn=9781563247248|pages=162|chapter=Chinese Diplomacy in Disarray: The Treaty of Livadia}}&lt;/ref&gt; economic powers similar to Germany's over [[Fengtian Province|Fengtian]], [[Jilin]] and [[Heilongjiang]] provinces. France gained a sphere over [[Yunnan]], [[Guangxi]] and [[Guangdong]] provinces, [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] over [[Fujian]] province, and the British Empire over the whole [[Yangtze River]] Valley and [[Treaty of Lhasa|Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties10.html Convention Between Great Britain and Tibet (1904)]&lt;/ref&gt; Only [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]'s request for [[Zhejiang]] province was declined by the Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lo Jiu-Hwa |first1=Upshur |title=Encyclopedia of World History, Ackerman-Schroeder-Terry-Hwa Lo, 2008: Encyclopedia of World History Volume 7 of Encyclopedia of World History |date=2008 |publisher=Fact on File Publishing, Inc Bukupedia |pages=87-88}}&lt;/ref&gt; These do not include the lease and [[concession territory|concession territories]] where the foreign powers had full authority.

In 1902, [[Winston Churchill]] gave a speech regarding the division of China by the great powers, where he declared that "we shall have to take the Chinese in hand and regulate them", "I believe in the ultimate partition of China" and "the Aryan stock is bound to triumph".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winstonchurchill.org/publications/finest-hour/finest-hour-159/wsc-a-midnight-interview-1902 Speech and interview at the University of Michigan, 1902.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian government militarily occupied their zone, imposed their law and schools, seized mining and logging privileges, settled their citizens, and even established their municipal administration on several cities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shan |first1=Patrick Fuliang |title=The Development of the North Manchuria Frontier, 1900-1931 |date=2003 |publisher=McMaster University |location=Hamilton, Ontario |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter without Chinese consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shan |first1=Patrick Fuliang |title=Taming China's Wilderness: Immigration, Settlement and the Shaping of the Heilongjiang Frontier, 1900-1931 |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1317046846 |page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The powers (and the United States) might have their own courts, post offices, commercial institutions, railroads, and gunboats in what was on paper Chinese territory. However, the foreign powers and their control in some cases could have been exaggerated; the local government persistently restricted further encroachment.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Fuliang Shan, “What was the ‘Sphere of Influence’? A Study of Chinese Resistance to the Russian Empire in  North Manchuria, 1900-1917,” ''The Chinese Historical Review'', (Fall 2006, vol. 13, no. 2), pp.271-291.&lt;/ref&gt; The system ended after the [[Second World War]].

[[File:Map Iran 1900-en.png|thumb|Delimitation of British and Russian influence in Iran]]
In the [[Anglo-Russian Convention]] of 1907, Britain and Russia partitioned Persia ([[Iran]]) into spheres of influence, with the Russians gaining recognition for influence over most of northern Iran, and Britain establishing a zone in the Southeast.&lt;ref&gt;British Documents on the Origins of the War 1898-1914, Volume IV, The Anglo-Russian Rapprochement 1903-7. Edited by G.P. Gooch and H Temperley. Her Majesty's Stationary Office, London 1929. p618-621.

For Siam ([[Thailand]]), Britain and France signed an agreement in 1904 whereby the British recognised a French sphere of influence to the east of the River Menam's ([[Chao Phraya River]]) basin; in turn, the French recognised British influence over the territory to the west of the Menam basin and west of the Gulf of Thailand. Both parties disclaimed any idea of annexing Siamese territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource | title=Declaration between the United Kingdom and France concerning Siam, Madagascar, and the New Hebrides | year=1904 | publisher=Governments of Great Britain and the French Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{see also|Foreign relations of the United States|Carter Doctrine|Monroe Doctrine}}
[[Alexander Hamilton]], first [[U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]], aimed for the United States to establish a sphere of influence in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1801-1829/monroe|title=Monroe Doctrine, 1823|last=|first=|date=April 6, 2016|website=Office of the Historian|publisher=United States Department of State|access-date=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton, writing in the [[Federalist Papers]], harboured ambitions for the U.S. to rise to world power status and gain the strength to expel European powers from the Americas, taking on the mantle of regional dominance among American nations, although most of the New World were European colonies during that period.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morison|first=S.E.|date=February 1924|title=The Origins of the Monroe Doctrine|jstor=2547870|journal=Economica|doi=10.2307/2547870|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This doctrine was formalised under President [[James Monroe]], who asserted that the New World was to be established as a Sphere of influence, removed from European encroachment. As the U.S. emerged as a world power, few nations dared to trespass on this sphere.&lt;ref name="Brit1"&gt;{{cite book |title= New Encyclopædia Britannica |edition= 15th |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica |volume= 8 |page= 269 |isbn= 1-59339-292-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, Secretary of State [[Rex Tillerson]] continued to refer to the Monroe doctrine to tout the United States as the region's preferred trade partner over other nations such as China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gramer|first1=Robbie|title=Tillerson Praises Monroe Doctrine, Warns Latin America of 'Imperial' Chinese Ambitions|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/02/02/tillerson-praises-monroe-doctrine-warns-latin-america-off-imperial-chinese-ambitions-mexico-south-america-nafta-diplomacy-trump-trade-venezuela-maduro/|website=Foreign Policy|publisher=The Slate Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
For another example, during the height of its existence in World War II, the [[Japanese Empire]] had quite a large sphere of influence. The Japanese government directly governed events in [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[Taiwan]], and parts of Mainland [[China]]. The "[[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]" could thus be quite easily drawn on a map of the [[Pacific Ocean]] as a large "bubble" surrounding the islands of [[Japan]] and the [[Asia]]n and Pacific nations it controlled.

===Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact===
According to a secret protocol attached to the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop pact]] of 1939 (revealed only after Germany's defeat in 1945), [[Northern Europe|Northern]] and [[Eastern Europe]] were divided into [[Nazi]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spheres of influence.&lt;ref name="mrtext"&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1939pact.html ''Text of the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact''], executed August 23, 1939&lt;/ref&gt; In the North, [[Finland]], [[Estonia]], and [[Latvia]] were assigned to the Soviet sphere.&lt;ref name="mrtext"/&gt; [[Poland]] was to be partitioned in the event of its "political rearrangement"&amp;mdash;the areas east of the [[Narev]], [[Vistula]], and [[San River]]s going to the Soviet Union while Germany would occupy the west.&lt;ref name="mrtext"/&gt; [[Lithuania]], adjacent to [[East Prussia]], would be in the German sphere of influence, although a second secret protocol agreed in September 1939 assigned Lithuania to the USSR.&lt;ref name="christie"&gt;Christie, Kenneth, ''Historical Injustice and Democratic Transition in Eastern Asia and Northern Europe: Ghosts at the Table of Democracy'', RoutledgeCurzon, 2002, {{ISBN|0-7007-1599-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another clause of the treaty stipulated that [[Bessarabia]], then part of [[Romania]], would join the [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldovan ASSR]] and become the [[Moldovan SSR]] under the control of Moscow.&lt;ref name="mrtext"/&gt; The Soviet invasion of [[Bukovina]] on 28 June 1940 violated the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, as it went beyond the Soviet sphere of influence as agreed with the Axis.&lt;ref&gt;Brackman, Roman The Secret File of Joseph Stalin: A Hidden Life (2001) p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; The USSR continued to deny the existence of the Pact's protocols until after the [[dissolution of the USSR]] when the Russian government fully acknowledged the existence and authenticity of the secret protocols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Etkind|first1=Alexander|last2=Finnin|first2=Rory|last3=Blacker|first3=Uilleam |author4=Julie Fedor |author5=Simon Lewis |author6=Maria Mälksoo |author7=Matilda Mroz|title=Remembering Katyn|year=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780745662961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of World War II===
From 1941 and the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack on the Soviet Union]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Coalition]] operated on the unwritten assumption that the Western Powers and the Soviet Union had each its own sphere of influence. The presumption of the US-British and Soviet unrestricted rights in their respective spheres started causing difficulties as the Nazi-controlled territory shrank and the allied powers successively liberated other states. The wartime spheres lacked a practical definition and it had never been determined if a dominant allied power was entitled to unilateral decisions only in the area of military activity, or could also force its will regarding political, social and economic future of other states. This overly informal system backfired during the late stages of the war and afterwards, when it turned out that the Soviets and the [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]] had very different ideas concerning the administration and future development of the liberated regions and of Germany itself.&lt;ref name="Davies Victory 172-174"&gt;[[Norman Davies]], ''[[Europe at War 1939–1945: No Simple Victory]]'', pp. 172-174. [[Penguin Books]], New York 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-14-311409-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cold War==
[[File:Soviet empire 1960.png|thumb|Greatest extent of Soviet influence, before the [[Sino-Soviet Split]]]]
During the [[Cold War]] the [[Baltic states]], [[Central Europe]], some countries in [[Eastern Europe]], [[Cuba]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]], [[North Korea]], and, until the [[Sino-Soviet split]], the [[People's Republic of China]], among other countries at various times, were said to lie under the [[Soviet sphere of influence]]. [[Western Europe]], [[Oceania]], [[Japan]], and [[South Korea]], among other places, were often said to lie under the sphere of influence of the [[United States]]. However, the level of control exerted in these spheres varied and was not absolute. For instance, France and Great Britain were able to [[Suez Crisis|act independently to invade]] (with [[Israel]]) the [[Suez Canal]] (they were later forced to withdraw by joint U.S. and Soviet pressure). Later, France was also able to withdraw from the military arm of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO). Cuba often took positions that put it at odds with its Soviet ally, including momentary alliances with the People's Republic of China, economic reorganizations, and providing support for insurgencies in Africa and the Americas without prior approval from the Soviet Union. {{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

With the end of the Cold War, the Eastern Bloc fell apart, effectively ending the Soviet sphere of influence. Then in 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed, replaced by the [[Russian Federation]] and several other [[Post-Soviet states|ex-Soviet Republics]] who became independent states.

==1990s to present==
{{see also|Foreign relations of Russia}}
After the fall of the Soviet Union, the countries of Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia that became independent were often portrayed as part of the Russian Federation's "sphere of influence". According to Ulrich Speck, writing for ''Carnegie Europe'', "After the breakup of the Soviet Union, the West's focus was on Russia. Western nations implicitly treated the post-Soviet countries (besides the Baltic states) as Russia's sphere of influence."&lt;ref name=Carnegie141209&gt;{{cite news |url= http://carnegieeurope.eu/2014/12/09/eu-must-prepare-for-cold-peace-with-russia |title= The EU Must Prepare for a Cold Peace With Russia |first= Ulrich |last= Speck |work= Carnegie Europe |date= 9 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[NATO]] and Russia signed the ''Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security'', stating the "aim of creating in Europe a common space of security and stability, without dividing lines or spheres of influence limiting the sovereignty of any state."&lt;ref name=FoundingAct&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_25468.htm |title= Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security between NATO and the Russian Federation signed in Paris, France |publisher= NATO |date= 27 May 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Russia asserted that the [[European Union]] desires a sphere of influence and that the [[Eastern Partnership]] is "an attempt to extend" it.&lt;ref name=EUO090321/&gt; In March 2009, Sweden's foreign minister [[Carl Bildt]] stated that "The Eastern Partnership is not about spheres of influence. The difference is that these countries themselves opted to join".&lt;ref name=EUO090321&gt;{{cite news |url= https://euobserver.com/foreign/27827 |title=EU expanding its 'sphere of influence,' Russia says |first= Valentina |last= Pop |work= [[EUObserver]] |date= 21 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2008 [[Russo-Georgian War]], [[Václav Havel]] and other former central and eastern European leaders signed an open letter stating that Russia had "violated the core principles of the [[Helsinki Final Act]], the [[Charter of Paris]]... -all in the name of defending a sphere of influence on its borders."&lt;ref name=GW090715/&gt; In April 2014, NATO stated that "Contrary to [the Founding Act], Russia now appears to be attempting to recreate a sphere of influence by seizing a part of Ukraine, maintaining large numbers of forces on its borders, and demanding, as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov recently stated, that “Ukraine cannot be part of any bloc.”"&lt;ref name=NATO140512&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_109141.htm |title= Russia’s accusations - setting the record straight, Fact Sheet - April 2014 |publisher= NATO |date= 12 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticising Russia in November 2014, German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] said that "old thinking about spheres of influence, which runs roughshod over international law" put the "entire European peace order into question".&lt;ref name=EUO141117&gt;{{cite news |url= https://euobserver.com/foreign/126540 |title= Merkel: Russia cannot veto EU expansion |first= Andrew |last= Rettman |work= [[EUobserver]] |date= 17 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, British Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] said, "We should not jeopardise the freedoms that President Reagan and Mrs Thatcher brought to Eastern Europe by accepting President Putin's claim that it is now in his sphere of influence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.businessinsider.com/full-text-theresa-mays-speech-to-the-republican-congress-of-tomorrow-conference-2017-1  |title= FULL TEXT: Theresa May's speech to the Republican 'Congress of Tomorrow' conference |publisher= Business Insider |date= 26 January 2017 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170127112956/http://www.businessinsider.com/full-text-theresa-mays-speech-to-the-republican-congress-of-tomorrow-conference-2017-1 |archivedate= 27 January 2017 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporations==
In corporate terms, the sphere of influence of a [[business]], organization or group can show its power and influence in the decisions of other businesses/organizations/groups. Influence shows in several ways, such as in size, frequency of visits, etc. In most cases, a company described as "bigger" has a larger sphere of influence.

For example, the software company [[Microsoft]] has a [[Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish|large sphere of influence]] in the market of [[operating system]]s; any entity wishing to sell a software product may weigh up  compatibility with Microsoft's products as part of a marketing plan.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In another example, retailers wishing to make the most profits must ensure they open their stores in the correct location. This is also true for shopping centers that, to reap the most profits, must be able to attract customers to their vicinity.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

There is no defined scale measuring such spheres of influence. However, one can evaluate the spheres of influence of two shopping centers by seeing how far people are prepared to travel to each shopping center, how much time they spend in its vicinity, how often they visit, the order of goods available, etc.{{citation needed|date= November 2015}}

The '''sustainable yield''' of [[natural capital]] is the [[ecological yield]] that can be extracted without reducing the base of capital itself, i.e. the [[Economic surplus|surplus]] required to maintain [[ecosystem services]] at the same or increasing level over time.  This yield usually varies over time with the needs of the [[ecosystem]] to maintain itself, e.g. a [[forest]] that has recently suffered a [[blight]] or [[flooding]] or [[fire]] will require more of its own ecological yield to sustain and re-establish a mature forest.  While doing so, the sustainable yield may be much less.

In forestry terms it is the largest amount of harvest activity that can occur without degrading the productivity of the stock.

[[File:Net fishing professionally 0544990019 KALFA.jpg|thumb| Fishery management utilizes the concept of sustainable yield to determine how much fish can be removed, so that the population remains sustainable.]]

This concept is important in fishery management, in which sustainable yield is defined as the number of fish that can be extracted without reducing the base of fish stock, and the [[maximum sustainable yield]] is defined as the amount of fish that can be extracted under given environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ricker|first=W.E.|date=1975|title=Computation and Interpretation of Biological Statistics of Fish Populations|journal=Bulletin of the Fisheries Research Board of Canada|volume=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fisheries, the basic natural capital or virgin population, must decrease with extraction. At the same time productivity increases. Hence, sustainable yield would be within the range in which the natural capital together with its production are able to provide satisfactory yield. It may be very difficult to quantify sustainable yield, because every dynamic ecological conditions and other factors  not  related to harvesting induce changes and fluctuations in both, the natural capital and its productivity.

In the case of [[groundwater]] there is a safe yield of water extraction per unit time, beyond which the [[aquifer]] risks the state of [[overdrafting]] or even depletion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3299">'''Terminological inexactitude''' is a phrase introduced in 1906 by British politician [[Winston Churchill]]. Today, it is used as a [[euphemism]] or [[circumlocution]] meaning a [[lie]] or untruth.

Churchill first used the phrase following the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|1906 election]]. Speaking in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 22 February 1906 as [[Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies|Under-Secretary of the Colonial Office]], he had occasion to repeat what he had said during the campaign. When asked that day whether the Government was condoning slavery of Chinese labourers in the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]], Churchill replied:&lt;ref name="safire"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[William Safire|Safire, William]]|title=Safire's Political Dictionary|date=2008|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=[[Oxford]]|isbn=9780195340617|page=474|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The conditions of the Transvaal ordinance ... cannot in the opinion of His Majesty's Government be classified as slavery; at least, that word in its full sense could not be applied without a risk of terminological inexactitude.&lt;ref name="safire" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=M3oyAQAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA250&amp;ots=tsnYBL8FUO&amp;dq=terminological%20inexactitude%20transvaal&amp;pg=PA250#v=onepage&amp;q=terminological%20inexactitude%20transvaal&amp;f=false ''The Outlook'', Volume 17] retrieved 28 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It has been used as a euphemism for a lie in the House of Commons, as to accuse another member of lying is considered [[unparliamentary language|unparliamentary]].

In more recent times, the term was used by [[Conservative MPs|Conservative MP]] [[Jacob Rees-Mogg]] to the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Oppositon]], [[Jeremy Corbyn]] over an accusation that Rees-Mogg's company had moved a [[hedge fund]] into the [[Eurozone]] despite him being in favour of [[Brexit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.sky.com/story/jacob-rees-mogg-accuses-jeremy-corbyn-of-terminological-inexactitude-for-brexit-jibe-11418702|title=Jacob Rees-Mogg accuses Jeremy Corbyn of 'terminological inexactitude' for Brexit jibe|work=Sky News|access-date=2018-09-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-40527522/jacob-rees-mogg-terminological-inexactitude-over-brexit|title=Rees-Mogg on 'terminological inexactitude'|website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/jacob-rees-mogg-accused-jeremy-12803192|title=Jacob Rees-Mogg accused Jeremy Corbyn of 'peddling false news' - here's why|last=Smith|first=Mikey|date=2018-06-27|work=mirror|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:AugustvonMackensen.jpg|thumb|200px|[[August von Mackensen]], German field marshal in hussar full dress prior to 1914, with the ''Totenkopf'' on his fur [[busby]]]]
'''''Totenkopf''''' (i.e. ''skull'', literally ''dead's head'') is the [[German language|German]] word for the [[Skull and crossbones (symbol)|skull and crossbones]] and [[Human skull symbolism|death's head]] symbols. The ''Totenkopf'' symbol is an old international symbol for death, the defiance of death, danger, or the dead, as well as [[piracy]]. It consists usually of the [[human skull]] with or without the [[mandible]] and often includes two crossed long-bones ([[femur]]s), most often depicted with the crossbones being ''behind'' some part of the skull. 

It is commonly associated with 19th- and 20th-century German military use.

== Etymology ==
''Toten-Kopf'' translates literally to "dead's head", meaning exactly "dead person's head". Semantically, it refers to a skull, literally a ''Schädel''.  As a term, ''Totenkopf'' connotes the human skull as a symbol, typically one with crossed thigh bones as part of a grouping.

Contemporary German language meaning of the word ''Totenkopf'' has not changed for at least two centuries.  For example, the German poet [[Clemens Brentano]] (b. 1778 – d. 1842) wrote in the story ''"Baron Hüpfenstich"'':&lt;br&gt; "Lauter Totenbeine und Totenköpfe, die standen oben herum ..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/-357/2 Clemens Brentano: Baron Hüpfenstich - Chapter 2] ([[Projekt Gutenberg-DE]])&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. "A lot of bones and skulls, they were placed above ...").

The common translation of "Totenkopf" as ''death's head'' is incorrect; it would be ''To'''des'''kopf'', but no such word is in use. The English term [[death squad]] is called ''To'''des'''schwadron'', not ''To'''ten'''schwadron''. It would be a logical fallacy to conclude that usage varies only because of the German naming of the [[Death's-head Hawkmoth]], which is called ''Skull Hawkmoth'' (''Totenkopfschwärmer'') in German, in the same way that it would be a fallacy to conclude that the German word ''Nachtkerze'' (i.e. night candle) would mean Willowherb, just because the [[Willowherb Hawkmoth]] (''Proserpinus proserpina'') is called ''Night Candle Hawkmoth'' (''[[w:de:Nachtkerzenschwärmer|Nachtkerzenschwärmer]]'', ''Proserpinus proserpina'') in German.

Use of the ''Totenkopf'' as a military emblem began under [[Frederick the Great]], who formed a regiment of [[Hussar]]  cavalry in the  [[Prussian army]] commanded by Colonel von Ruesch, the Husaren-Regiment Nr. 5 (von Ruesch). It adopted a black uniform with a ''Totenkopf'' emblazoned on the front of its [[Mirliton (military)|mirlitons]] and wore it on the field in the [[War of Austrian Succession]] and in the [[Seven Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reid |first=Stuart |date=2010 |title=Frederick the Great’s Allies 1756–63 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=m3uHCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT28&amp;dq=Totenkopf+Frederick+the+Great&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYhbfUjOnVAhXNZlAKHWafCcUQ6AEIVTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Totenkopf%20Frederick%20the%20Great&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Osprey Publishing |page= |isbn=978-1849081771 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Totenkopf'' remained a part of the uniform when the regiment was reformed into Leib-Husaren Regiments Nr.1 and Nr.2 in 1808.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nash |first=David |date=1972 |title=The Prussian Army, 1808-1815 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5pXfAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Leib-Husaren+Regiments+Nr.1+Totenkopf&amp;dq=Leib-Husaren+Regiments+Nr.1+Totenkopf&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq-Ii5iunVAhWQL1AKHTXxAG0Q6AEINzAC |location= |publisher=Almark Publishing |page=54 |isbn=978-0855240752 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Brunswick ===
[[File:Braunschweiger Totenkopf.jpg|thumb|200px|''Totenkopf'' badge worn by the Brunswick ''Leibbataillon'' ("Life-Guard Battalion") at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815.]]
In 1809 during the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]], [[Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]] raised a force of volunteers to fight [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], who had conquered the Duke's lands. The Brunswick corps was provided with black uniforms, giving rise to their nickname, the [[Black Brunswickers]]. Both hussar cavalry and infantry in the force wore a ''Totenkopf'' badge, either in mourning for the duke's father, [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]], who had been killed at the [[Battle of Jena–Auerstedt]] in 1806, or according to some sources, as a sign of revenge against the French. After fighting their way through Germany, the Black Brunswickers entered British service and fought with them in the [[Peninsular War]] and at the [[Battle of Waterloo]]. The Brunswick corps was eventually incorporated into the Prussian Army in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ospreypublishing.com/title_detail.php/title=Q1469~ser=MAA Osprey Publishing - The Black Brunswickers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003049/http://www.ospreypublishing.com/title_detail.php/title%3DQ1469~ser%3DMAA |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== German Empire===
The skull continued to be used by the Prussian and Brunswick armed forces until 1918, and some of the [[stormtrooper]]s that led the last German offensives on the Western Front in 1918 used skull badges.&lt;ref&gt;''First World War'' - Willmott, H.

=== Weimar Republic ===
[[File:Garford Putilov in Freikorps use.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Garford-Putilov Armoured Car]] used by the ''[[Freikorps]]'' in 1919, with a ''Totenkopf'' painted on the side.]] 
The ''Totenkopf'' was used in Germany throughout the inter-war period, most prominently by the ''[[Freikorps]]''. In 1933, it was in use by the regimental staff and the 1st, 5th, and 11th squadrons of the ''[[Reichswehr]]''{{'}}s 5th Cavalry Regiment as a continuation of a tradition from the ''Kaiserreich''.

=== Third Reich ===
In the early days of the [[NSDAP]], [[Julius Schreck]], the leader of the [[1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler|''Stabswache'']] ([[Adolf Hitler]]'s bodyguard unit), resurrected the use of the ''Totenkopf'' as the unit's insignia. This unit grew into the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS), which continued to use the ''Totenkopf'' as insignia throughout its history. According to a writing by [[Reichsführer-SS]] [[Heinrich Himmler]] the ''Totenkopf'' had the following meaning:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''Skull'' is the reminder that you shall always be willing to put your self at stake for the life of the whole community.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Himmler: "Der Totenkopf ist die Mahnung, jederzeit bereit zu sein, das Leben unseres Ichs einzusetzen für das Leben der Gesamtheit."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Totenkopf'' was also used as the unit insignia of the ''Panzer'' forces of the German [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|''Heer'']] (Army), and also by the ''Panzer'' units of the [[Luftwaffe]], including those of the elite [[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann Göring]].&lt;ref&gt;Angolia, John R., and Adolf Schlicht, ''Uniforms and Traditions of the Luftwaffe Volume 2'', R. James Bender Publishing, San Jose, CA, 1997. {{ISBN|0-912138-71-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the [[3rd SS Division Totenkopf|3rd SS Panzer Division]] of the [[Waffen-SS]], and the World War II era Luftwaffe's 54th Bomber Wing ''[[Kampfgeschwader 54]]'' were given the unit name "''Totenkopf''", and used a strikingly similar-looking graphic skull-crossbones insignia as the [[SS]] units of the same name. The 3rd SS Panzer Division also had skull patches on their uniform collars instead of the SS sieg rune.

* The British Army's [[Royal Lancers]] continue to use the skull and crossbones in their emblem, inherited from its use by the [[17th Lancers]], a unit raised in 1759 following [[General Wolfe]]'s death in Quebec.

* In 1792, a regiment of ''[[Hussards de la Mort|Hussards de la Mort]]'' (Death Hussars) was formed during the [[French Revolution]] by the [[French National Assembly]] and were organized and named by [[François Christophe de Kellermann|Kellerman]]. The group of 200 volunteers were from wealthy families and their horses were supplied from the King's Stables. They were formed to defend against various other European states in the wake of the revolution. They participated in the [[Battle of Valmy]] and its members also participated in the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)]].

* The [[Kingdom of Sweden]]'s Hussar Regiments wore a death's head emblem in the Prussian Style on the front of the mirleton.
* [[Ramón Cabrera]]'s regiment adopted in 1838 a skull with crossbones flanked by an [[olive branch]] and a sword on a black flag during the Spanish [[Carlist Wars]].

* The Russian [[Lavr Kornilov|Kornilov's]] Shock Detachment ([[8th Army (Russian Empire)|8th Army]]) adopted a death's head emblem in 1917. Then after World War I, the unit became Kornilov's Shock Regiment as a part of the [[White movement|White Russian]] [[Volunteer Army]] during the [[Russian Civil War]].

* [[South Korea]]'s [[3rd Infantry Division (South Korea)|3rd Infantry Division]] (백골부대) have a skull-and-crossbones in their emblem.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}
* Many [[United States Cavalry]] reconnaissance troops or squadrons utilize a skull insignia, often wearing the traditional Stetson hat, and backed by either crossed cavalry sabers, crossed rifles, or some other variation, as an unofficial unit logo. These  logos are incorporated into troop T-shirts, challenge coins, or other items designed to enhance morale and esprit de corps.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12413">'''Vicarious embarrassment''' (also known as secondhand, empathetic, or third party embarrassment) is the feeling of embarrassment from observing the embarrassing actions of another person. Unlike general [[embarrassment]], vicarious embarrassment is not caused by participating in an embarrassing event, but instead it's caused by witnessing (either verbally or visually) another person's experience an embarrassing event. These emotions can be perceived as pro-social, and some say they can be seen as motives for following socially and culturally acceptable behavior.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=Martin L.|date=1990-06-01|title=Empathy and justice motivation|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00991641|journal=Motivation and Emotion|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=151–172|doi=10.1007/BF00991641|issn=0146-7239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Kipling D.|date=2007|title=Ostracism|url=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.psych.58.110405.085641|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=58|issue=1|pages=425–452|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.58.110405.085641|pmid=16968209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vicarious embarrassment (German: [[wiktionary:Fremdscham#German|fremdscham.]]) is often seen as an opposite to [[schadenfreude]], which is the feeling of pleasure or satisfaction at misfortune, humiliation or embarrassment of another person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/07/19/332760081/the-opposite-of-schadenfreude-vicarious-embarrassment|title=The Opposite Of Schadenfreude: Vicarious Embarrassment|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/redeye/redeye-fremdscham-is-like-the-inverse-of-schadenfreude-20160108-story.html|title=This is why you don't like cringe comedies|last=Curiosity|work=RedEye Chicago|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vicarious embarrassment is different from an [[emotional contagion]], which is when a person unconsciously mimics the emotions that others are experiencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hatfield|first=Elaine|last2=Cacioppo|first2=John T.|last3=Rapson|first3=Richard L.|date=2016-06-22|title=Emotional Contagion|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8721.ep10770953|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|language=en|volume=2|issue=3|pages=96–100|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10770953}}&lt;/ref&gt; An emotional contagion is experienced by both people making it a [[Group emotion|shared emotion]]. Vicarious embarrassment often occurs even when the individual experiencing the embarrassing event might not be aware of the implications. For an act to be considered an emotional contagion, more than one person must be affected by the emotion, but in vicarious emotions, it is only necessary that the observer experience the emotion.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barsade|first=Sigal G.|date=2002-12-01|title=The Ripple Effect: Emotional Contagion and its Influence on Group Behavior|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/3094912|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|language=en|volume=47|issue=4|pages=644–675|doi=10.2307/3094912|issn=0001-8392}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, vicarious embarrassment can be experienced even when the observer is completely isolated.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Vicarious embarrassment, like other vicarious emotions, presents symptoms that reflect the original emotion. However, unlike [[Group emotion|shared emotions]], the experience of embarrassment for the observer is dependent on how they normally experience embarrassment. Individuals who experience [[social anxiety]] in their own life may experience the familiar symptoms of [[blushing]],&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nikolić|first=Milica|last2=Colonnesi|first2=Cristina|last3=de Vente|first3=Wieke|last4=Drummond|first4=Peter|last5=Bögels|first5=Susan M.|date=2015-06-01|title=Blushing and Social Anxiety: A Meta-Analysis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cpsp.12102/abstract|journal=Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice|language=en|volume=22|issue=2|pages=177–193|doi=10.1111/cpsp.12102|issn=1468-2850}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feinberg|first=Matthew|last2=Willer|first2=Robb|last3=Keltner|first3=Dacher|date=January 2012|title=Flustered and faithful: embarrassment as a signal of prosociality|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=102|issue=1|pages=81–97|doi=10.1037/a0025403|issn=1939-1315|pmid=21928915}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Perspiration|excess sweating]], [[Tremor|trembling]], [[palpitations]], and [[nausea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Acarturk|first=C.|last2=de Graaf|first2=Ron|last3=van Straten|first3=A.|last4=Have|first4=M.

==  Psychological basis ==

=== Empathy ===
Vicarious embarrassment, also known as empathetic embarrassment, is intrinsically linked to empathy. [[Empathy]] is the ability to understand the feelings of another and is considered a highly reinforcing emotion to promote [[Altruism|selflessness]], [[prosocial behavior]],&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; and [[group emotion]], whereas a lack of empathy is related to [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial behavior]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jV5QVgM6Me8C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Emotions in Social Psychology: Essential Readings|last=Parrott|first=W.

People who have more empathy are more likely to be susceptible to vicarious embarrassment.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krach|first=Sören|last2=Cohrs|first2=Jan Christopher|last3=Loebell|first3=Nicole Cruz de Echeverría|last4=Kircher|first4=Tilo|last5=Sommer|first5=Jens|last6=Jansen|first6=Andreas|last7=Paulus|first7=Frieder Michel|date=2011-04-13|title=Your Flaws Are My Pain: Linking Empathy To Vicarious Embarrassment|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018675|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=6|issue=4|pages=e18675|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0018675|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity recognize emotions is probably innate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/460061527|title=Unlock the positive potential hidden in your DNA|last=D.|first=Baird, James|date=2010|publisher=New Page Books|others=Nadel, Laurie, 1948-|isbn=9781601631053|location=Franklin Lakes, NJ|oclc=460061527}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it may be achieved unconsciously. Yet it can be trained and achieved with various degrees of intensity or accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teaching Empathy|last=O'Malley|first=J|publisher=|year=1999|isbn=|location=America|pages=22–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-projection ===
[[Psychological projection]] is a theory in [[psychology]] and [[psychoanalysis]] in which humans defend themselves against undesirable emotions by [[denying]] their existence in themselves while [[Attribution (psychology)|attributing]] them to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt5hhr4b|title=Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Volume 11: Psychology and Religion: West and East|last=C. G.|first=JUNG|date=1969|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=|editor-last=ADLER|editor-first=GERHARD|editor-last2=HULL|editor-first2=R. F. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projection is a considered a normal, common process in everyday life.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIIkSgAACAAJ&amp;dq=wade+psychology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj80-Dj3fDXAhUI5oMKHeiTAUQQ6AEIKzAB|title=Psychology|last=Wade|first=Carole|last2=Tavris|first2=Carol|date=2002|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780130982636|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vicarious embarrassment and other vicarious emotions, however, work in the reverse, a process called [[self projection]]. The undesirable emotion is experienced in another person, and the observer projects what they interpret as the appropriate response the event onto themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mills|first=Jon|date=2013-02-01|title=Jung's metaphysics|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/19409052.2012.671182|journal=International Journal of Jungian Studies|volume=5|issue=1|pages=19–43|doi=10.1080/19409052.2012.671182|issn=1940-9052}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, someone who lies easily might feel vicariously embarrassed if they self projecting the experience of someone getting caught in a bad lie.

== Cultural significance ==
Embarrassing situations often arise in social situations, as the result of failing to meet a social expectation, and is used to help learn what has been deemed culturally appropriate.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2012/11/14/the-psychology-of-embarrassment/|title=The Psychology of Embarrassment|date=2012-11-14|work=World of Psychology|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; While embarrassment isolates the victim based on a cultural bias, vicarious embarrassment is used to promote prosocial behavior between the victim and the observer.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Cringe comedy ===

{{Main|Cringe comedy}}
Embarrassing situations have been used for a long time in [[Sitcom|situational comedy]], [[sketch comedy]], [[Irony|dramatic irony]], and [[practical joke]]s. Traditionally, [[laugh track]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s were used to help cue the audience to laugh at appropriate times. But as laugh tracks were removed from sitcoms, embarrassing situations on television were now accompanied by silence, creating a genre known as [[cringe comedy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-04-16/features/9202030928_1_laugh-tracks-audience|title=Funny Business|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A47391-2005Mar18.html|title=With 'Office,' NBC Goes Off the Beaten Laugh Track (washingtonpost.com)|website=www.washingtonpost.com|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://curiosity.com/topics/dont-like-cringe-comedies-you-probably-have-fremdscham-curiosity/|title=Don't Like Cringe Comedies?

==History and Origin==
Originating in Ancient Greece, rhetoric has been widely discussed for thousands of years. Sophists first coined the idea as an abstract term to help label the concept while Aristotle more narrowly defined rhetoric as a message's potential to influence audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rhetorical tradition : readings from classical times to the present|last=|first=|date=1990|publisher=Bedford Books of St. Martin's Press|others=Bizzell, Patricia., Herzberg, Bruce.|isbn=9780312003487|location=Boston|pages=22|oclc=21325600}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Linguists and other researchers often define rhetoric through the well-known [[Rhetoric#Canons|five cannons of rhetoric]]. Over time, this definition has evolved, expanded, and raised serious debate as new digital mediums of communicating have developed.

Visual rhetoric's first mentioning (1977) brought to light a new way to evaluate other communication means, showing the relevance of traditional rhetorical theories to the still photographic medium.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Image, music, text|last=Roland.|first=Barthes,|date=1977|publisher=Hill and Wang|others=Heath, Stephen.|isbn=978-0374521363|location=New York|oclc=3414738}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barthes explained visual rhetoric generally as the implied and interpreted messages from the work, yet these bigger messages often extend beyond the initial superficial interpretation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Visual rhetoric uses a variety of tools to hook readers within its mediums (e.g. gifs).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140809020040-134901798-attraction-and-persuasion-in-advertising-a-beginner-s-guide-to-visual-rhetoric/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230000000/https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140809020040%2D134901798%2Dattraction%2Dand%2Dpersuasion%2Din%2Dadvertising%2Da%2Dbeginner%2Ds%2Dguide%2Dto%2Dvisual%2Drhetoric/|title=Attraction and Persuasion in Advertising - A Beginner's Guide to Visual Rhetoric|last=Ly-Le|first=Tuong-Minh|date=August 9, 2014|website=LinkedIn|archive-date=2016-12-30|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although similar in nature, one striking difference between visual and classical rhetoric is the newfound outlook on Aristotle's original cannons. Linda Scott created a newfound audience by constructing new cannons exclusive to visual rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Instead of closely monitoring the content, as with the initial five cannons, Scott's focused on the visual medium's ability to ''invent'' and argument, ''arrangement'' of the item, and all coupled with a meaningful ''delivery'' of presentation. Since its inception, popular studies have appeared in published works to discuss the role of visual rhetoric in many facets of human life, especially advertising.

The term emerged largely as an effort to set aside a certain area of study that would focus attention on specific rhetorical elements of visual mediums.&lt;ref name="Hill2004" /&gt; Historically, the study of rhetoric has been geared toward linguistics.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  Visual symbols were deemed trivial and subservient and thus, were largely ignored as part of a rhetorical argument. As a result, modern rhetorical theory developed with a significant exclusion of these visual symbols, ignoring the field of visual rhetoric as a separate area of study.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  Scholars of visual rhetoric analyze photographs, drawings, paintings, graphs and tables, interior design and architecture, sculpture, Internet images, and film.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  From a rhetorical perspective, the focus is on the contextual response rather than the aesthetic response.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  An aesthetic response is a viewer's direct perception with the sensory aspects of the visual, whereas with a rhetorical response, meaning is given to the visual.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  Every part of the artifact has significance in the message being conveyed; each line, each shading, each person has a purpose.&lt;ref name="10/21/13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.uncw.edu/atkinsa/496/Framing%20the%20Study%20of%20Visual%20Rhetoric.pdf|title=Framing the Study of Visual Rhetoric: Toward a Transformation for Rhetorical Theory|last=Foss|first=Sonja|accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As visual rhetoricians study images and symbols, their findings catalyze challenges to the linguistic meaning altogether, allowing a more holistic study of the rhetorical argument to emerge with the introduction of visual elements.

== Related Studies ==

=== Composition ===
The field of [[composition studies]] has recently returned its attention to visual rhetoric. In an increasingly visual society, proponents of visual rhetoric in composition classes suggest that increased literacy requires writing and visual communication skills. Visual communication skills relate to an understanding of the mediated nature of all communication, especially to an awareness of the act of representation.&lt;ref name="Hill2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="George2002" /&gt; Visual rhetoric can be utilized in a composition classroom to assist with writing and rhetoric development.  {{Main|Visual rhetoric and composition}}
[[File:Canada Stop sign.svg|thumb|A stop sign is an example of semiotics in everyday life.  Drivers understand that the sign means they must stop. Stop signs exist in a larger context of road signs, all with different meanings, designed for traffic safety.]]

=== Semiotics ===
Visual rhetoric is closely related to the study of [[semiotics]], which is the study of the use of signs and symbols and their meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/semiotics|title=Definition of SEMIOTICS|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semiotic theory seeks to describe the rhetorical significance of sign-making. The central idea of the theory is that a sign does not exist outside of a contextual experience, but it only exists in relation to other signs, objects, and entities. Therefore, the sign belongs to a larger system, and when taken out of context of other signs, is rendered meaningless and uncommunicable. The parts of a semiotic are divided into two parts: the material part of the sign is known as the ''form of expression,'' the meaning of the form of expression is known as ''form of content''.&lt;ref name="Ehses, Lupton" /&gt; In semiotic theory, the expression only has meaningful content when existing in a larger contextual framework.

=== Areas of Focus ===
While studying visual objects, rhetorical scholars tend to have three areas of study: nature, function, or evaluation.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  Nature encompasses the literal components of the artifact.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  This is a primary focus of visual rhetoric because in order to understand the function of an image, it is necessary to understand the substantive and stylistic nature of the artifact itself.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  Function holds a somewhat literal definition—it represents the purpose an image serves for an audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.uncw.edu/atkinsa/496/Framing%20the%20Study%20of%20Visual%20Rhetoric.pdf|title=Framing a Study of Visual Rhetoric: Toward a Transformation of Rhetorical Theory|last=Foss|first=Sonja|accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The function, or purpose, of an image may be to evoke a certain emotion.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  The evaluation of an artifact determines if the image serves its function.

== Rhetorical Application ==
Visual rhetoric studies how humans use images to communicate.  Elements of images, such as size color, line, and shape, are used to convey messages.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Multimodality--a Social Semiotic Approach to Contemporary Communication|last=Kress|first=Gunther|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=9780415320610|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In images, meanings are created by the layout and spatial positions of these elements.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The entities that constitute an image are socially, politically, and culturally constructed. The same image may represent different rhetorical meanings depending on the audience. The choice and arrangement of the elements in an image should be used to achieve the desired rhetorical effects and convey messages accurately to specific audiences, societies, and cultures.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The use of images is a conscious, communicative decision as the colors, form, medium, and size are each chosen on purpose.&lt;ref name="10/21/132"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.uncw.edu/atkinsa/496/Framing%20the%20Study%20of%20Visual%20Rhetoric.pdf|title=Framing the Study of Visual Rhetoric: Toward a Transformation for Rhetorical Theory|last=Foss|first=Sonja|accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a person may come in contact with a sign, but if they have no relation to the sign, its message is arbitrary. Therefore, in order for artifacts or products to be conceptualized as visual rhetoric, they must be symbolic, involve human intervention, and be presented to an audience for the purpose of communicating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.uncw.edu/atkinsa/496/Framing%20the%20Study%20of%20Visual%20Rhetoric.pdf|title=Framing the Study of Visual Rhetoric Toward a Transformation of Rhetorical Theory|last=Foss|first=Sonja|accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Rhetoric of the Image," French theorist Roland Barthes examines the semiotic nature of images, and the ways that images function to communicate specific messages. Barthes points out that messages transmitted by visual images include coded iconic and non-coded iconic linguistic messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rhetorical Theory--An Introduction|last=Borchers|first=Timothy|publisher=Waveland Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1577667315|location=Long Grove ILL|pages=271–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visual rhetorical images can be categorized into two dimensions: meaning operation and visual structure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Meaning operation refers to the relations and connections between elements in visual images. Visual structure refers to the way that the elements are visually displayed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Barbara|last2=McQuarrie|first2=Edward|date=2004|title=Beyond Visual Metaphor: A New Typology of Visual Rhetoric in Advertising|journal=Marketing Theory|volume=4(1/2)|pages=113–136|doi=10.1177/1470593104044089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern Application ==
Visual images have always played a role in communication, however the recent advancements in technology have enabled users to produce and share images on a mass scale.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McComiskey|first=Bruce|date=1 Jan 2014|title=Visual Rhetoric and the New Public Discourse|url=|journal=JAC: A Journal of Rhetoric, Culture, &amp; Politics|volume=24|pages=187–206|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mass communication of images has made spread of news and information a much quicker process.  As a result, certain images may go "viral", meaning the image may have been shared and seen by a large number of audiences, and attracted mainstream media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-it-mean-to-go-viral-3486225|title=What Does 'Going Viral Online' Really Mean?|work=Lifewire|access-date=2018-03-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Images are utilized in a variety of ways for a number of purposes. From business to art to entertainment, the versatility of images in popular culture have some scholars arguing words will eventually become outdated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Advertisements ===
Advertisers know that their consumers are able to associate one thing to another; therefore, when an ad shows two things that seemingly different, they know that the consumer will find a connection between the two.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Barbara|last2=McQuarrie|first2=Edward|date=2004|title=Beyond visual metaphor: A new typology of visual rhetoric in advertising|url=https://courses.helsinki.fi/sites/default/files/course-material/4482592/22.3_MT2004%20Phillips.pdf|journal=Marketing Theory|volume=4|pages=113–136|doi=10.1177/1470593104044089}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisers also find ways to make sure that the consumer creates a positive association between what they are selling and whatever they are associating their product with.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In advertising, there are nine main classifications for how ads incorporate visual rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These classifications vary in complexity with the least complex being when advertisers juxtapose their product with another image (listed as 1,2,3).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After juxtaposition, the complexity is increased with fusion, which is when an advertiser's product is combined with another image (listed as 4,5,6).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The most complex is replacement, which replaces the product with another product (listed as 7,8,9). Each of these sections also include a variety of richness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The most rich would be connection, which shows how one product is associated with another product (listed as 1,4,7).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The next rich would be similarity, which shows how a product is like another product or image (listed as 2,5,8,).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, the most rich would be opposition, which is when advertisers show how their product is not like another product or image (listed as 3,6,9).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
# Advertisers can put their product next to another image in order to have the consumer associate their product with the presented image.
# Advertisers can put their product next to another image to show the similarity between their product and the presented image.
# Advertisers can put their product next to another image in order to show the consumer that their product is nothing like what the image shows.
# Advertisers can combine their product with an image in order to have the consumer associate their product with the presented image.
# Advertisers can combine their product with an image to show the similarity between their product and the presented image.
# Advertisers can combine their product with another image in order to show the consumer that their product is nothing like what the image shows.
# Advertisers can replace their product with an image to have the consumer associate their product with the presented image.
# Advertisers can replace their product with an image to show the similarity between their product and the presented image.
# Advertisers can replace their product with another image to show the consumer that their product is nothing like what the image shows.
Each of these categories varies in complexity, where putting a product next to a chosen image is the simplest and replacing the product entirely is the most complex.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The reason why putting a product next to a chosen image is the most simple is because the consumer has already been shown that there is a connection between the two.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In other words, the consumer just has to figure out why there is the connection. However, when advertisers replace the product that they are selling with another image, then the consumer must first figure out the connection and figure out why the connection was made.

=== Visual Arts ===
Visual [[Trope (linguistics)|trope]]s and tropic thinking are a part of visual rhetoric. While the field of visual rhetoric isn't necessarily concerned with the aesthetic choices of a piece, the same principles of visual composition may be applied to the study and practice of [[visual art]]. For example, [[figures of speech]], such as [[personification]] or [[allusion]], may be implemented in the creation of an artwork. A painting may ''allude'' to peace with an olive branch or to Christianity with a cross; in the same way, an artwork may employ personification by attributing human qualities to a non-human entity. In general, however, visual art is a separate field of study than visual rhetoric.[[File:Grafiti corazón.jpg|thumb|This image portrays a young person holding a heart. Instead of looking at this image literally, rhetoricians will observe the keyhole in the heart's center and think critically about this image's significance.]]

=== Graffiti ===
[[Graffiti]] is a "pictorial or visual inscription on a {{sic|public|ally}} accessible surface."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanauer|first=David|date=2011|title=The discursive construction of the separation wall at Abu Dis: Graffiti as political discourse|url=|journal=Journal of Language and Politics|volume=10|pages=301–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hanauer, Graffiti achieves three functions; the first is to allow marginalized texts to participate in the public discourse, the second is that graffiti serves the purpose of expressing openly "controversial contents", and the third is to allow "marginal groups to the possibility of expressing themselves publicly."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanauer|first=David|date=2004|title=Silence, voice and erasure: psychological embodiment  in graffiti at the site of Prime Minister Rabin's assassination|url=|journal=The Arts in Psychotherapy|volume=31|pages=29–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bates and Martin note that this form of rhetoric has been around even in ancient Pompeii; with an example from 79 A.D. reading, "Oh wall, so many men have come here to scrawl, I wonder that your burdened sides don't fall".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bates|first=John|date=1980|title=The thematic content of graffiti as a nonreactive indicator of male and female attitudes|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|volume=16|issue=4|pages=300–315|doi=10.1080/00224498009551087}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gross and Gross indicated that graffiti is capable of serving a rhetorical purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gross|first=Daniel D.|last2=Gross|first2=Timothy|date=1993|title=TAGGING:Changing Visual Patterns and the Rhetorical Implications of a New Form of Graffiti|url=|journal=Review of General Semantics|volume=50|pages=251– 264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a more modern context, Wiens' (2014) research showed that graffiti can be considered an alternative way of creating rhetorical meaning for issues such as homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=HOME IS WHERE THE SPRAY-PAINTED HEART IS: GRAFFITI AS RHETORICAL RESISTANCE ON SKID ROW|last=Wiens|first=Brianna I.|work=Master thesis|publisher=ProQuest|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, according to Ley and Cybriwsky graffiti can be an expression of territory, especially within the context of gangs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ley|first=David|date=1974|title=Urban Graffiti as Territorial Markers|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/39166347/ley1974.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1518993322&amp;Signature=ci5e6vVAM1PDYr%2FBHksRpCNFbkQ%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DURBAN_GRAFFITI_AS_TERRITORIAL_MARKERS.pdf|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume=64|pages=491}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This form of Visual Rhetoric is meant to communicate meaning to anyone who so happens to see it, and due to its long history and prevalence, several styles and techniques have emerged to capture the attention of an audience.

=== Visual Rhetoric of Text ===
While visual rhetoric is usually applied to denote the non-textual artifacts, the use and presentation of words is still critical to understanding the visual argument as a whole. Beyond how a message is conveyed, the presentation of that message encompasses the study and practice of [[typography]]. Professionals in fields from graphic design to book publishing make deliberate choices about how a typeface looks, including but not limited to concerns of functionality, emotional evocations, and cultural context.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bierut, "Now You See It and Other Essays on Design." Princeton Architectural Press. New York. November 7, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memes ===
Though a relatively new way of using images, [[Internet meme|memes]] are one of the more pervasive forms of visual rhetoric. Considered by scholars to be a subversive form of communication,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Heidi|date=2013|title=Subversive Memes: Internet Memes as a Form of Visual Rhetoric|url=https://spir.aoir.org/index.php/spir/article/view/785/pdf|journal=Selected Papers of Internet Research|volume=14|pages=|via=AOiR}}&lt;/ref&gt; memes are a style of rhetoric that "combines elements of the semiotic and discursive approaches to analyze the persuasive elements of visual texts." Furthermore, memes fit into this rhetorical category because of their persuasive nature and their ability "to draw viewers into the argument’s construction via the viewer’s cognitive role in completing “visual enthymemes” to fill in the unstated premise."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

According to a 2013 study by Bauckhage, et al., the temporal nature of most memes and their "hype cycles" of popularity are in line with the behavior of a typical [[fad]] and suggest that after they proliferate and become mainstream, memes quickly lose their appeal and popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauckhage|first=Christian|last2=Kersting|first2=Kristian|last3=Hadiji|first3=Fabian|date=2013-06-28|title=Mathematical Models of Fads Explain the Temporal Dynamics of Internet Memes|url=https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM13/paper/viewPaper/6022|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the intrinsic factors of memes that affect their potential rise to popularity is similarity. A 2014 study conducted by researcher Michele Coscia concluded that meme similarity has a negative correlation to meme popularity, and can therefore be used, along with factors like social network structure, to explain the popularity of various memes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coscia|first=Michele|date=2014-09-26|title=Average is Boring: How Similarity Kills a Meme's Success|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep06477|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=4|issue=1|pages=6477|doi=10.1038/srep06477|pmid=25257730|pmc=4175728|issn=2045-2322}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study by Mazambani, et al. concluded that other factors of influence in meme spread within an online community include how relevant a meme is to the "topic focus" or theme of the online community as well as whether the posting user is in a position of power within an online setting.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mazambani|first=Gideon|last2=Carlson|first2=Maria A.|last3=Reysen|first3=Stephen|last4=Hempelmann|first4=Christian F.|date=2015|title=Impact of Status and Meme Content on the Spread of Memes in Virtual Communities|url=https://jyx.jyu.fi/dspace/handle/123456789/47918|journal=Human Technology: An Interdisciplinary Journal on Humans in ICT Environments|volume=11|issue=2|pages=148–164|doi=10.17011/ht/urn.201511113638}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memes that are consistent with a group's theme and memes that originate from lower-status members within the group spread faster than memes that are inconsistent and are created by members of a group that are in positions of power.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Scholars like Jakub Nowak propose the idea of popular driven media as well. Successful memes originate and proliferate by means of anonymous internet users, not entities like corporations or political parties that have an agenda. For this reason, anonymity is linked to meme popularity and credibility. Nowak asserts that meme authorship should remain anonymous, because this is the only way to let people make the statements that they want to freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nowak|first=Jakub|date=2016|title=Internet meme as meaningful discourse: towards a theory of multiparticipant popular online content|url=https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=458796|journal=Central European Journal of Communication|language=English|volume=9|issue=16|pages=73–89|issn=1899-5101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water conservation''' includes all the policies, strategies and activities to [[sustainably]] manage the [[natural resource]] of [[fresh water]], to protect the [[hydrosphere]], and to meet the current and future human  [[demand]]. Population, household size, and growth and affluence all affect how much water is used. Factors such as [[climate change]] have increased pressures on natural water resources especially in [[manufacturing]] and agricultural [[irrigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/water/conserve/|title=Water conservation « Defra |work=defra.gov.uk |year=2013 |accessdate=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many US cities have already implemented policies aimed at water conservation, with much success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www3.epa.gov/watersense/docs/utilityconservation_508.pdf|title=Cases in Water Conservation: How Efficiency Programs Help Water Utilities Save Water and Avoid Costs|last=|first=|date=|website=EPA.gov|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals of water conservation efforts include:
* Ensuring [[water resources|availability of water]] for future generations where the withdrawal of [[freshwater]] from an [[ecosystem]] does not exceed its natural replacement rate.
* [[Energy conservation]] as water pumping, delivery and [[wastewater treatment]] facilities consume a significant amount of energy. In some regions of the world over 15% of total [[electricity consumption]] is devoted to [[water management]]. 
* [[Habitat conservation]] where minimizing human water use helps to preserve [[freshwater habitat]]s for local wildlife and migrating [[waterfowl]], but also [[water quality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hermoso |first1=Virgilio |last2=Abell |first2=Robin |last3=Linke |first3=Simon |last4=Boon |first4=Philip |title=The role of protected areas for freshwater biodiversity conservation: challenges and opportunities in a rapidly changing world |journal=Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems |date=2016 |volume=26 |issue=S1 |pages=3–11 |doi=10.1002/aqc.2681|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.2681/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategies==

The key activities that benefit water conservation(save water) are as follows:
#Any beneficial reduction in [[Drying|water loss]], use and waste of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Duane D. Baumann|author2=John J. Boland|author3=John H. Sims|date=April 1984|title=Water Conservation: The Struggle over Definition|journal=Water Resources Research|volume=20|pages=428–434|url=  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/WR020i004p00428/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Avoiding any damage to [[water quality]].
#Improving [[water management]] practices that reduce the use or enhance the beneficial use of water.&lt;ref name="Vickers, Amy 2002"&gt;{{cite book |title=Water Use and Conservation |last=Vickers |first=Amy |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher= water plow Press |location=Amherst, MA |isbn=1-931579-07-5 |page=434 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Geerts | first1 = S. | last2 = Raes | first2 = D. | year = 2009 | title = Deficit irrigation as an  on-farm strategy to maximize crop water productivity in dry areas | doi = 10.1016/j.agwat.2009.04.009 | journal = Agric. Water Manage | volume = 96 | issue = 9| pages = 1275–1284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
One strategy in water conservation is [[rain water harvesting]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar Kurunthachalam|first=Senthil|year=2014|title=Water Conservation and Sustainability: An Utmost Importance.|url=|journal=Hydrol Current Res|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digging ponds, lakes, canals, expanding the water reservoir, and installing rain water catching ducts and filtration systems on homes are different methods of harvesting rain water. Many people in many countries keep clean containers so they can boil it and drink it, which is useful to supply water to the needy.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Harvested and filtered rain water can be used for toilets, home gardening, lawn irrigation, and small scale agriculture.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Another strategy in water conservation is protecting [[groundwater]] resources. When precipitation occurs, some infiltrates the soil and goes underground.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nwrfc.noaa.gov/info/water_cycle/hydrology.cgi|title=Description of the Hydrologic Cycle|last=|first=|date=|website=nwrfc.noaa.gov/rfc/|publisher=NOAA River Forecast Center|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water in this saturation zone is called groundwater.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; [[groundwater contamination|Contamination of groundwater]] causes the groundwater water supply to not be able to be used as resource of fresh drinking water and the natural regeneration of contaminated groundwater can takes years to replenish.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.groundwater.org/get-informed/groundwater/contamination.html|title=Potential threats to Groundwater|last=|first=|date=|website=groundwater.org/|publisher=The Groundwater Foundation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of potential sources of groundwater contamination include storage tanks, [[septic tank|septic]] systems, uncontrolled [[hazardous waste]], [[landfill]]s, [[atmospheric contaminants]], chemicals, and [[road salt]]s.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Contamination of groundwater decreases the replenishment of available freshwater so taking preventative measures by protecting groundwater resources from contamination is an important aspect of water conservation.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

An additional strategy to water conservation is practicing sustainable methods of utilizing groundwater resources.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Groundwater flows due to gravity and eventually discharges into streams.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Excess pumping of groundwater leads to a decrease in groundwater levels and if continued it can exhaust the resource.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Ground and surface waters are connected and overuse of groundwater can reduce and, in extreme examples, diminish the water supply of lakes, rivers, and streams.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; In coastal regions, over pumping groundwater can increase saltwater intrusion which results in the contamination of  groundwater water supply.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Sustainable use of groundwater is essential in water conservation.

A fundamental component to water conservation strategy is communication and education outreach of different water programs.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Delgado|first1=Jorge A.|last2=Groffman|first2=Peter M.|last3=Nearing|first3=Mark A.|last4=Goddard|first4=Tom|last5=Reicosky|first5=Don|last6=Lal|first6=Rattan|last7=Kitchen|first7=Newell R.|last8=Rice|first8=Charles W.|last9=Towery|first9=Dan|last10=Salon|first10=Paul|title=Conservation practices to mitigate and adapt to climate change|journal=Journal of Soil and Water Conservation|date=1 July 2011|volume=66|issue=4|pages=118A–129A|doi=10.2489/jswc.66.4.118A|url=http://www.jswconline.org/content/66/4/118A.refs|accessdate=25 May 2018|language=en|issn=0022-4561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developing communication that educates science to land managers, policy makers, farmers, and the general public is another important strategy utilized in water conservation.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Communication of the science of how water systems work is an important aspect when creating a management plan to conserve that system and is often used for ensuring the right management plan to be put into action.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Social solutions ==
[[File:VineyardDrip.JPG|thumb|right|[[Drip irrigation]] system in [[New Mexico]]]]
Water conservation programs involved in social solutions are typically initiated at the local level, by either municipal [[water industry|water utilities]] or regional governments.  Common strategies include public [[outreach]] campaigns,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wateruseitwisely.com "Water - Use It Wisely."] U.S. multi-city public outreach program. Park &amp; Co., Phoenix, AZ. Accessed 2010-02-02.&lt;/ref&gt; tiered water rates (charging progressively higher prices as water use increases), or restrictions on outdoor water use such as lawn watering and car washing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |title=Cases in Water Conservation |url=http://www.epa.gov/watersense/docs/utilityconservation_508.pdf |author=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |year=2002 |accessdate=2010-02-02}} Document No. EPA-832-B-02-003.&lt;/ref&gt; Cities in dry climates often require or encourage the installation of [[xeriscaping]] or [[natural landscaping]] in new homes to reduce outdoor water usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abcwua.org/content/view/132/222/ |title= Xeriscape Rebates |author= Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority |authorlink= |date= 2009-02-06 |work= |location=Albuquerque, NM |accessdate= 2010-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most urban outdoor water use in California is residential,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heberger|first=Matthew|year=2014|title=Issue Brief|url=http://pacinst.org/app/uploads/2014/06/ca-water-urban.pdf|journal=Urban Water Conservation and efficiency Potential in California|volume=|pages=12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating a reason for outreach to households as well as businesses.

One fundamental conservation goal is universal metering. The prevalence of residential [[water meter]]ing varies significantly worldwide. Recent studies have estimated that water supplies are metered in less than 30% of UK households,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innovations-report.com/html/reports/environment_sciences/report-60279.html "Time for universal water metering?"] ''Innovations Report.'' May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and about 61% of urban Canadian homes (as of 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |title=Municipal Water Use, 2001 Statistics |url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/water-apps/en/info/pubs/sss/e_mun2001.pdf |author=Environment Canada |year=2005 |accessdate=2010-02-02}} Cat. No. En11-2/2001E-PDF. {{ISBN|0-662-39504-2}}. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Although individual water meters have often been considered impractical in homes with private wells or in multifamily buildings, the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] estimates that metering alone can reduce consumption by 20 to 40 percent.&lt;ref name="EPA-Conserve"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/owow/nps/nps-conserve.html |title=How to Conserve Water and Use It Effectively |author=EPA |date=2010-01-13 |work= |location=Washington, DC|accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to raising consumer awareness of their water use, metering is also an important way to identify and localize [[water leakage]].  Water metering would benefit society, in the long run, it is proven that water metering increases the efficiency of the entire water system, as well as help unnecessary expenses for individuals for years to come.  One would be unable to waste water unless they are willing to pay the extra charges, this way the water department would be able to monitor water usage by the public, domestic and manufacturing services.

Some researchers have suggested that water conservation efforts should be primarily directed at farmers, in light of the fact that crop irrigation accounts for 70% of the world's fresh water use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pimentel, Berger|title=Water resources: agricultural and environmental issues |journal=BioScience |volume=54 |issue=10 |pages=909 |date=October 2004 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2004)054[0909:WRAAEI]2.0.CO;2|display-authors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The agricultural sector of most countries is important both economically and politically, and water subsidies are common.  Conservation advocates have urged removal of all subsidies to force [[farmers]] to grow more water-efficient crops and adopt less wasteful irrigation techniques.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

New technology poses a few new options for consumers, features such as full flush and half flush when using a toilet are trying to make a difference in water consumption and waste.  Also available are modern [[shower head]]s that help reduce wasting water: Old shower heads are said to use 5-10 gallons per minute, while new fixtures available are said to use 2.5 gallons per minute and offer equal water coverage.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

== Household applications ==
The Home Water Works website contains useful information on household water conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.home-water-works.org|title=Water Usage Calculator, Water Conservation and Efficiency - Home Water Works|website=www.home-water-works.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to the popular view that the most effective way to save water is to curtail water-using behavior (e.g., by taking shorter showers),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/02/26/1316402111|title=Perceptions of water use|first=Shahzeen Z.|last=Attari|date=26 February 2014|publisher=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=201316402|via=www.pnas.org|doi=10.1073/pnas.1316402111|pmid=24591608|pmc=3986180}}&lt;/ref&gt; experts suggest the most efficient way is replacing toilets and retrofitting washers; as demonstrated by two [[Residential water use in the U.S. and Canada|household end use logging]] studies in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, P.W.; DeOreo, W.B.; Opitz, E.M.; Kiefer, J.C.; Davis, W.Y.; Dziegielewski, B.; &amp; Nelson, J.O., 1999.

Water-saving technology for the home includes:
#Low-flow shower heads sometimes called energy-efficient shower heads as they also use less energy
#[[Low flush toilet|Low-flush toilet]]s and [[composting toilet]]s. These have a dramatic impact in the developed world, as conventional Western [[toilet]]s use large volumes of water
#[[Dual flush toilet]]s created by [[Caroma]] includes two buttons or handles to flush different levels of water. Dual flush toilets use up to 67% less water than conventional toilets
#[[Faucet aerator]]s, which break water flow into fine droplets to maintain "wetting effectiveness" while using less water. An additional benefit is that they reduce splashing while washing hands and dishes
#[[Raw water flushing]] where toilets use sea water or non-purified water
#[[Reclaimed water|Wastewater reuse]] or recycling systems, allowing:
#*Reuse of [[greywater|graywater]] for flushing toilets or watering gardens
#*Recycling of wastewater through [[water purification|purification]] at a water treatment plant. ''See also [[Wastewater#Reuse|Wastewater - Reuse]]''
#[[Rainwater harvesting]]
#High-efficiency [[washing machine|clothes washer]]s
#Weather-based irrigation controllers
#[[Garden hose]] [[nozzle]]s that shut off the water when it is not being used, instead of letting a hose run.
# Low flow taps in wash basins
#[[Swimming pool]] covers that reduce evaporation and can warm pool water to reduce water, energy and chemical costs.
#[[Automatic faucet]] is a water conservation faucet that eliminates water waste at the faucet. It automates the use of faucets without the use of hands.

== Commercial applications ==
Many water-saving devices (such as low-flush toilets) that are useful in homes can also be useful for business water saving. Other water-saving technology for businesses includes:
*[[Waterless urinal]]s
*[[Waterless car wash]]es
*[[Infrared]] or foot-operated taps, which can save water by using short bursts of water for rinsing in a kitchen or bathroom
*Pressurized waterbrooms, which can be used instead of a hose to clean sidewalks
*[[Radiography|X-ray]] film processor re-circulation systems
*[[Cooling tower]] conductivity controllers
*Water-saving [[steam sterilizer]]s, for use in hospitals and health care facilities
*[[Rain water harvesting]]
*Water to Water [[heat exchanger]]s.

== Agricultural applications ==
[[Image:PivotIrrigationOnCotton.jpg|thumb|216px|right|Overhead irrigation, [[Center pivot irrigation|center pivot]] design]]
For crop irrigation, optimal [[water efficiency]] means minimizing losses due to [[evaporation]], [[Surface runoff|runoff]] or subsurface drainage while maximizing production.  An [[evaporation pan]] in combination with specific crop correction factors can be used to determine how much water is needed to satisfy plant requirements.  [[surface irrigation|Flood irrigation]], the oldest and most common type, is often very uneven in distribution, as parts of a field may receive excess water in order to deliver sufficient quantities to other parts. [[Irrigation#Overhead (sprinkler) irrigation|Overhead irrigation]], using center-pivot or lateral-moving sprinklers, has the potential for a much more equal and controlled distribution pattern. [[Drip irrigation]] is the most expensive and least-used type, but offers the ability to deliver water to plant roots with minimal losses. However, drip irrigation is increasingly affordable, especially for the home gardener and in light of rising water rates. Using drip irrigation methods can save up to 30,000 gallons of water per year when replacing irrigation systems that spray in all directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www3.epa.gov/watersense/outdoor/tech.html|title=Water-Saving Technologies|last=|first=|date=|website=WaterSense: An EPA Partnership Program|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also cheap effective methods similar to drip irrigation such as the use of soaking hoses that can even be submerged in the growing medium to eliminate evaporation.

As changing irrigation systems can be a costly undertaking, conservation efforts often concentrate on maximizing the efficiency of the existing system.  This may include chiseling compacted soils, creating furrow dikes to prevent runoff, and using soil moisture and rainfall sensors to optimize irrigation schedules.&lt;ref name="EPA-Conserve"/&gt; Usually large gains in efficiency are possible through measurement and more effective management of the existing irrigation system. The 2011 UNEP Green Economy Report notes that "[i]mproved [[soil organic matter]] from the use of green manures, mulching, and recycling of crop residues and animal manure increases the water holding capacity of soils and their ability to absorb water during torrential rains",&lt;ref&gt;UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, www.unep.org/greeneconomy&lt;/ref&gt; which is a way to optimize the use of rainfall and irrigation during dry periods in the season.

== Water Reuse ==
Water shortage has become an increasingly difficult problem to manage. More than 40% of the world's population live in a region where the demand for water exceeds its supply. The imbalance between supply and demand, along with persisting issues such as climate change and exponential [[population growth]], has made water reuse a necessary method for conserving water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-23892-0|title=Wastewater Reuse and Current Challenges - Springer|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-23892-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of methods used in the [[Water treatment|treatment of waste water]] to ensure that it is safe to use for irrigation of food crops and/or drinking water.

Seawater desalination requires more energy than the desalination of fresh water. Despite this, many seawater desalination plants have been built in response to water shortages around the world. This makes it necessary to evaluate the impacts of seawater desalination and to find ways to improve desalination technology. Current research involves the use of experiments to determine the most effective and least energy intensive methods of desalination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elimelech|first=Menachem|last2=Phillip|first2=William A.|date=2011-08-05|title=The Future of Seawater Desalination: Energy, Technology, and the Environment|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6043/712|journal=Science|language=en|volume=333|issue=6043|pages=712–717|doi=10.1126/science.1200488|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21817042}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Han|first=Songlee|last2=Rhee|first2=Young-Woo|last3=Kang|first3=Seong-Pil|date=2017-02-17|title=Investigation of salt removal using cyclopentane hydrate formation and washing treatment for seawater desalination|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011916416309742|journal=Desalination|volume=404|pages=132–137|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2016.11.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sand filter|Sand filtration]] is another method used to treat water. Recent studies show that sand filtration needs further improvements, but it is approaching optimization with its effectiveness at removing pathogens from water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seeger|first=Eva M.|last2=Braeckevelt|first2=Mareike|last3=Reiche|first3=Nils|last4=Müller|first4=Jochen A.|last5=Kästner|first5=Matthias|date=2016-10-01|title=Removal of pathogen indicators from secondary effluent using slow sand filtration: Optimization approaches|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857416303937|journal=Ecological Engineering|volume=95|pages=635–644|doi=10.1016/j.ecoleng.2016.06.068}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vries|first=D.|last2=Bertelkamp|first2=C.|last3=Kegel|first3=F.

The removal of [[pathogen]]s from recycled water is of high priority because wastewater always contains pathogens capable of infecting humans. The levels of pathogenic viruses have to be reduced to a certain level in order for recycled water to not pose a threat to human populations. Further research is necessary to determine more accurate methods of assessing the level of pathogenic viruses in treated wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerba|first=Charles P.|last2=Betancourt|first2=Walter Q.|last3=Kitajima|first3=Masaaki|title=How much reduction of virus is needed for recycled water: A continuous changing need for assessment?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004313541630865X|journal=Water Research|volume=108|pages=25–31|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2016.11.020|pmid=27838026|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wasting of water ==
[[File:Leaking garden hose bib.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Leaking garden hose bib]]
Wasting of water (also called "water waste" in the U.S.) is the flip side of water conservation and, in household applications, it means causing or permitting discharge of water without any practical purpose. Inefficient water use is also considered wasteful. By [[EPA]] estimate, household leaks in the U.S. can waste approximately 900 billion gallons (3.4 billion cubic meters) of water annually nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/watersense/statistics-and-facts |title=Statistics and Facts &amp;amp;#124; WaterSense &amp;amp;#124; US EPA |website=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, water management agencies are reluctant or unwilling to give a concrete definition to the somewhat fuzzy concept of '''water waste'''.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/bibarticles/neuman_forfeiture.pdf |title=Janet C. Neuman. Beneficial Use, Waste, and Forfeiture:The Inefficient Search for Efficiency in Western Water Use |date= |accessdate=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, definition of water waste is often given in local drought emergency ordinances. One example refers to any acts or omissions, whether willful or negligent, that are “causing or permitting water to leak, discharge, flow or run to waste into any gutter, sanitary sewer, watercourse or public or private storm drain, or to any adjacent property, from any tap, hose, faucet, pipe, sprinkler, pond, pool, waterway, fountain or nozzle.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qcode.us/codes/roseville/view.php?topic=14-14_09-14_09_030&amp;frames=off |title=14.09.030 Definition of water waste |website=Qcode.us |date= |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this example, the city code also clarifies that “in the case of washing, “discharge,” “flow” or “run to waste” means that water in excess of that necessary to wash, wet or clean the dirty or dusty object, such as an automobile, sidewalk, or parking area, flows to waste. Water utilities (and other media sources) often provide listings of wasteful water-use practices and prohibitions of wasteful uses. Examples include utilities in San Antonio, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saws.org/conservation/waterwaste/whatiswaste.cfm |title=SAWS Report Water Waste - What is Water Waste? |website=Saws.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Las Vegas, Nevada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lvvwd.com/conservation/waste.html |title=Water Waste |website=Lvvwd.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; California Water Service company in California,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.calwater.com/conservation/water-waste-report/ |title=Report Water Waste |publisher=Cal Water |date=2015-12-03 |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and City of San Diego, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sandiego.gov/water/conservation/kids/tips |title=Water Saving Tips &amp;#124; City of San Diego Official Website |website=Sandiego.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City of Palo Alto in California enforces permanent water use restrictions on wasteful practices such as leaks, runoff, irrigating during and immediately after rainfall, and use of potable water when non-potable water is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/news/displaynews.asp?NewsID=2336&amp;TargetID=235,310 |title=Water &amp; Drought Update - Palo Alto Water Use Guidelines |date= |accessdate=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar restrictions are in effect in the State of Victoria, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.water.vic.gov.au/liveable-cities-and-towns/permanent-water-saving-rules |title=Permanent water saving rules |date= |accessdate=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temporary water use bans (also known as "hosepipe bans") are used in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Water UK http://www.water.org.uk/consumers/tubs&lt;/ref&gt; 

Strictly speaking, water that is discharged into the sewer, or directly to the environment is not wasted or lost. It remains within the [[hydrologic cycle]] and returns to the land surface and surface water bodies as precipitation. However, in many cases, the source of the water is at a significant distance from the return point and may be in a different catchment. The separation between extraction point and return point can represent significant environmental degradation in the watercourse and riparian strip. What is "wasted" is the community's supply of water that was captured, stored, transported and treated to drinking quality standards. Efficient use of water saves the expense of water supply provision and leaves more fresh water in lakes, rivers and aquifers for other users and also for supporting ecosystems. A concept that is closely related to water wasting is "water-use efficiency." Water use is considered [[inefficiency|inefficient]] if the same purpose of its use can be accomplished with less water. Technical [[efficiency]] derives from engineering practice where it is typically used to describe the ratio of output to input and is useful in comparing various products and processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Dziegielewski, B. J.|author2=Kiefer, C.|title=Water Conservation Measurement Metrics: Guidance Report|journal=American Water Works Association|date=January 22, 2010|url=https://www.awwa.org/Portals/0/files/resources/resource%20dev%20groups/tech%20and%20educ%20program/documents/WaterConservationMeasurementMetricsGuidanceReport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, one showerhead would be considered more efficient than another if it could accomplish the same purpose (i.e., of showering) by using less water or other inputs (e.g., lower water pressure). However, the technical efficiency concept is not useful in making decisions of investing money (or resources) in water conservation measures unless the inputs and outputs are measured in value terms. This expression of efficiency is referred to as [[economic efficiency]] and is incorporated into the concept of water conservation.
