'''Advanced Placement Spanish Literature and Culture''' (often referred to as '''AP Spanish Literature and Culture''', '''AP Spanish Literature''', '''AP Spanish Lit''' or '''AP SpLit''') is a [[high school]] course and examination offered by the [[College Board|College Board's]] [[Advanced Placement Program]].

==The course==
This course is based on improving skills in written Spanish and critical reading of advanced [[Spanish literature|Spanish]] and [[Latin American literature]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  It is typically taught as a Spanish V or VI course. The AP Spanish Literature course is designed to be comparable to a third-year college/university introductory Hispanic literature course. Students concentrate on developing proficiency in reading and writing in preparation for the AP Spanish Literature examination. In addition, this course emphasizes mastery of linguistic competencies at a very high level of proficiency.

The course has a required reading list that draws from a variety of sources, including such well-known authors and poets as [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]], [[Tirso de Molina]], [[Gabriel García Márquez]], [[Alfonsina Storni]], [[Juan Rulfo]], [[Isabel Allende]], and [[Miguel de Unamuno]], as well as a miscellany of lesser-known short stories, poems, and novels. A complete list of the [http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/members/exam/exam_information/219542.html readings] is regulated annually by the College Board.  The course is meant to be taught entirely in Spanish, though [http://siempreleer.blogspot.com/ English translations] of the stories are often common resources for students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/spanish_lit/reading.html AP: Spanish Literature&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The exam==
The exam is divided into two sections with several parts. Section I, consisting of 65 multiple-choice questions, is split into two parts. Part A (15 questions) is the listening component, which includes a twice-recited poem, a recording of an interview with an author, and a presentation concerning a topic that relates to the course. Part B (50 questions) is reading comprehension based on a wide variety of works, including a literary criticism and selections from works that are not on the required reading list. 80 minutes is given for the entire section.&lt;ref&gt;http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/members/exam/exam_information/2009.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Section II is free-response, containing two short-answer questions and two longer essays. The first question is based on an excerpt from a work on the required reading list, and students must name the author, identify the time period, and, most importantly, elaborate on the theme presented in the passage (15 minutes). The second question asks students to read an excerpt from a work on the required reading list and compare the theme presented to that of an accompanying piece of artwork (15 minutes). The third question tests students' ability to link a piece of literature on the required reading list to the greater genre or movement to which it belongs (35 minutes). Finally, the fourth question directs students to analyze the literary techniques in two excerpts, one of which is from a work on the required reading list, that are used to convey a shared theme (35 minutes). 100 minutes is allotted for this section.&lt;ref&gt;https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-spanish-literature-and-culture/about-the-exam&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/members/exam/exam_information/2009.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In all, the test is approximately 3 hours in duration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4842">The '''American National Corpus''' (ANC) is a  [[text corpus]] of [[American English]] containing 22 million words of written and spoken data produced since 1990. Currently, the ANC includes a range of genres, including emerging genres such as email, tweets, and web data that are not included in earlier corpora such as the [[British National Corpus]]. It is annotated for [[Lexical category|part of speech]] and [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]], [[shallow parsing|shallow parse]], and [[Named entity|named entities]].

The ANC is available from the [[Linguistic Data Consortium]]. A fifteen million word subset of the corpus, called the '''Open American National Corpus''' (OANC), is freely available with no restrictions on its use from the ANC Website.

The corpus and its annotations are provided according to the specifications of [[ISO/TC 37]] SC4's Linguistic Annotation Framework. By using a freely provided transduction tool (ANC2Go), the corpus and user-chosen annotations is provided in multiple formats, including CoNLL IOB format, the XML format conformant to the [[XCES|XML Corpus Encoding Standard]] (XCES) (usable with the [[British National Corpus]]'s XAIRA search engine), a [[UIMA]]-compliant format, and formats suitable for input to a wide variety of concordance software. Plugins to import the annotations into [[General Architecture for Text Engineering]] (GATE) are also available.

The ANC differs from other corpora of English because it is richly annotated, including different [[Lexical category|part of speech]] annotations (Penn tags, CLAWS5 and CLAWS7 tags), [[shallow parsing|shallow parse annotations]], and  annotations for several types of [[Named entity|named entities]]. Additional annotations are added to all or parts of the corpus as they become available, often by contributions from other projects. Unlike on-line searchable corpora, which due to copyright restrictions allow access only to individual sentences, the entire ANC is available to enable research involving, for example, development of statistical language models and full-text linguistic annotation.

ANC annotations are automatically produced and unvalidated. 
A 500,000 word subset called the [[Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC)]] is annotated for approximately 20 different kinds of linguistic annotations, all of which have been hand-validated or manually produced. These include [https://web.archive.org/web/20160404152309/http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/ Penn Treebank] syntactic annotation, [[WordNet]] sense annotation, [[FrameNet]] semantic frame annotations, among others. Like the OANC, MASC is freely available for any use, and can be downloaded from the ANC site or from the  [[Linguistic Data Consortium]]. It is also distributed in part-of-speech tagged form with the [[Natural Language Toolkit]].

The ANC and its sub-corpora differ from similar corpora primarily in the range of linguistic annotations provided and the inclusion of modern genres that do not appear in resources like the [[British National Corpus]]. Also, because the initial target use of the corpora was the development of statistical language models, the full data and all annotations are available, thus differing from the  [[Corpus of Contemporary American English]] (COCA) which is available only selectively through a web browser.

Continued growth of the OANC and MASC relies on contributions of data and annotations from the computational linguistics and corpus linguistics communities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2947">'''Ancient proteins''' are the remains of [[protein]]s which persist in the archaeological and fossil record. They are studied by a branch of [[molecular palaeontology]], ancient protein research.

==The history of ancient proteins studies== 

In 1955, [[Philip Abelson]] published a short paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Paleobiochemistry: organic constituents of fossils|last1=Abelson|first1=Philip|publisher=Carnegie Institution of Washington, Yearbook, No. 54|year=1955|isbn=|location=|pages=107-109}}&lt;/ref&gt; that laid out what has become, through several cycles of technical advances, the field of palaeoproteomics or ancient protein research. He was the first to propose that amino acids, and therefore proteins, were present in a fossil bone millions of years old which gave clues about the evolution of very early life forms on our planet. Only a few years later, Hare and Abelson (1968) conducted another pioneering analysis on shells and found out that [[amino acid]]s degrade or change their internal L to D configuration progressively over time, and that this could thus be used as dating tool, in what is called amino acid dating or amino acid [[racemization]].&lt;ref name="Hare+Abelson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hare|first1=P.E.|last2=Abelson|first2=P.H.|title=Racemization of amino acids in fossil shells|journal=Carnegie Inst. Wash. Yearb.|date=1968|volume=66|pages=526-528}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dating approach was later shown to be a very capable tool for dating periods extending further back than the limits of radiocarbon at ca. 50.000 years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Penkman|first=Kirsty|date=2010-05-01|title=Amino acid geochronology: its impact on our understanding of the Quaternary stratigraphy of the British Isles|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jqs.1346|journal=Journal of Quaternary Science|language=en|volume=25|issue=4|pages=501–514|doi=10.1002/jqs.1346|issn=1099-1417|bibcode=2010JQS....25..501P}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Palaeoproteomics== 

Palaeoproteomics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cappellini|first=Enrico|last2=Collins|first2=Matthew J.|last3=Gilbert|first3=M. Thomas P.|date=2014-03-21|title=Unlocking Ancient Protein Palimpsests|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/343/6177/1320|journal=Science|language=en|volume=343|issue=6177|pages=1320–1322|doi=10.1126/science.1249274|issn=0036-8075|pmid=24653025|bibcode=2014Sci...343.1320C}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an emerging neologism used to describe the application of mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches to the study of ancient proteomes. As with palaeogenomics (the study of [[ancient DNA]], aDNA), it intersects [[evolutionary biology]], [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]], with applications ranging from the phylogenetic reconstruction of extinct species to the investigation of past human diets and ancient diseases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6830">'''Archaeobiology''', the study of the biology of ancient times through archaeological materials, is a [[Archaeological sub-disciplines|subspecialty]] of [[archaeology]]. It can be seen as a blanket term for [[paleobotany]], animal [[osteology]], zooarchaeology, microbiology, and many other sub-disciplines. Specifically, plant and animal remains are also called [[ecofacts]]. Sometimes these ecofacts can be left by humans and sometimes they can be naturally occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Robert|title=Archaeology: Down To Earth|year=2014|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-1-133-60864-6|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeobiology tends to focus on more recent finds, so the difference between archaeobiology and [[palaeontology]] is mainly one of date: archaeobiologists typically work with more recent, non-[[fossil]]ised material found at archaeological sites. Only very rarely are archaeobiological excavations performed at sites with no sign of human presence.

==Flora and Fauna in Archaeology==
The prime interest of [[paleobotany]] is to reconstruct the vegetation that people in the past would have encountered in a particular place and time.&lt;ref name="Renfrew 2005 245"&gt;{{cite book|last=Renfrew|first=Colin|title=Archaeology: Theories, Methods, and Practice 5th Edition|year=2005|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-500-28713-2|pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant studies have always been overshadowed by faunal studies because bones are more conspicuous than plant remains when excavating.&lt;ref name="Renfrew 2005 245"/&gt; Collection of plant remains could everything including pollen, soil, diatoms, wood, plant remains and [[phytoliths]]. Phytoliths are sediments and diatoms are water deposits. Each plant remain can tell the archaeologist different things about the environment during a certain time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Renfrew|first=Colin|title=Archaeology: Theories, Methods, and Practice|year=2005|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-500-28713-2|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Animal remains were the first evidence used by 19th century archaeologists. Today, archaeologists use faunal remains as a guide to the environment. It helps archaeologists understand whether the fauna were present naturally or through activities of carnivores or people.&lt;ref name="Renfrew and Bahn"&gt;{{cite book|last=Renfrew|first=Colin|title=Archaeology: Theories, Methods and Practice 5th Edition|year=2005|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-500-28713-2|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists deal with [[macrofauna]] and [[microfauna]]. Microfauna are better indicators of climate and environmental change than larger species. These can be as small as a bug or as big as a fish or bird.  Macrofauna helps archaeologists build a picture of past human diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Renfrew|first=Colin|title=Archaeology: Theories, Methods, Practice 5th Edition|year=2005|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-500-28713-2|pages=253–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bacteria and Protists in Archaeology==
[[Bacteria]] and [[Protists]] form two separate  kingdoms, but both are fairly similar when compared. Bacteria are [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] microorganisms, while protists are a group of [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms. Because both are microorganisms, both fall under the study of [[microbiology]] and special techniques are required for archaeologists to even see them.
Archaeologists, in order to find these microorganisms in a site, have to first take samples from the site and bring them in for lab analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herring|first=Angela|title=Ancient bacteria go under the lens|url=http://www.northeastern.edu/news/2013/10/ancient-bacteria-go-under-the-lens/|publisher=Northeaster.edu|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once in the lab, they can use equipment such as [[optical microscope]]s, in order to actually see evidence of micro organic remains. Archaeologists that look at these microorganisms do not actually find the living bacteria or protist, but instead find indentations left behind in material from where they had been. Depending on where the indentations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Stephen|title=Microarchaeology: Beyond the Visible Archaeological Record|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  were in the [[strata]], archaeologists can determine the age of the microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Powell|first=Devin|title=Bacterial traces from 3.5 billion years ago are oldest fossils; experts say|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-12-31/national/36103962_1_australian-rocks-sedimentary-rocks-oldest-fossils|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=31 October 2013|date=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paleomycology==
[[Paleomycology]] is the study of [[fungi]] in the fossil record. The study of past fungi can lead to the evolutionary past. Much of fungi are made up of parasites of animals, plants or insects. Most of the contemporary fungi resemble its ancestors, dating back over a million years ago. For example, “In the Dominican amber, a mosquito was found with several types of parasitic fungi growing on its outside cuticle. What is interesting is that the fungi resemble modern day fungi in class Trichomycetes, which are common gut-inhabiting zygomycetes of insects, but they differ from Trichomycetes in that the fungi are on the outside of the insect rather than the inside.” The study of ancient fungi can be used to track the evolution of fungi through millions of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hodge|first=Kathie|title=Paleomycology: Discovering the fungal contemporaries of dinosaurs|url=https://blog.mycology.cornell.edu/2009/05/13/paleomycology-discovering-the-fungal-contemporaries-of-dinosaurs/|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Osteology in Archaeology==
The study of [[osteology]] is a study of bones and can be a subdiscipline in archeology. Osteologists in archeology reconstruct bones of humans or animals from the past to find more about the past civilizations. . Osteology is used in archaeology to determine the age, gender, and ethnicity of the remains.  It is also helpful to rebuild past societies’ cultural background. Using the remains from the past can help modern archaeologist uncover the past from what they ate to their daily activities. This can help uncover the mysteries of past histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mackinnon|first=Michael|title=Osteological Research in Classical Archaeology|journal=State of the Discipline|date=July 2007|pages=1|url=http://www.ajaonline.org/sites/default/files/1113_MacKinnon.pdf|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BACnet''' is a [[communications protocol]] for Building Automation and Control (BAC) networks that leverage the [[ASHRAE]], [[ANSI]], and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 16484-5 standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | authorlink = ASHRAE
 | title = Standard 135-2016-- BACnet--A Data Communication Protocol for Building Automation and Control Networks (ANSI Approved)
 | date = 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; protocol.

BACnet was designed to allow communication of [[building automation]] and control systems for applications such as heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning control ([[HVAC]]), lighting control, access control, and fire detection systems and their associated equipment. The BACnet protocol provides mechanisms for computerized building automation devices to exchange information, regardless of the particular building service they perform.

==History==
The development of the BACnet protocol began in June, 1987, in Nashville, Tennessee, at the inaugural meeting of the ASHRAE BACnet committee, known at that time as SPC 135P, "EMCS Message Protocol".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bacnet.org/DL-Docs/SPC135-Nashville-Minutes-1987-06.pdf |title=Minutes of the First SPC 135P Meeting|author=SPC 135P |date=June 26, 1987|publisher=ASHRAE |access-date=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee worked at reaching consensus using working groups to divide up the task of creating a standard. The working groups focused on specific areas and provided information and recommendations to the main committee. The first three working groups were the Data Type and Attribute Working Group, Primitive Data Format Working Group, and the Application Services Working Group.

BACnet became ASHRAE/ANSI Standard 135 in 1995, and [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=37298 ISO 16484-5] in 2003. The Method of Test for Conformance to BACnet was published in 2003 as BSR/ASHRAE Standard 135.1. BACnet is under continuous maintenance by the ASHRAE Standing Standard Project Committee 135.

BACnet had an almost immediate impact on the [[HVAC]] controls industry. In 1996 [[Alerton]] announced a complete BACnet product line for HVAC controls, from the operator's workstation down to small [[variable air volume]] (VAV) controllers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RbLQj6tWJzAC|title=BACnet|last=Newman|first=Michael|publisher=Momentum Press|year=2013|isbn=9781606502907|location=New York|pages=|chapter=2.9.1 ALERTON|oclc=909981984|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Automated Logic Corporation]] and Delta Controls soon followed suit. On July 12, 2017 BACnet reached a milestone with the issuance of the 1000th Vendor ID. Vendor IDs are assigned by ASHRAE and are distributed internationally. Those vendor identifiers can be viewed at [http://www.bacnet.org/VendorID/BACnet%20Vendor%20IDs.htm the BACnet website].

H. Michael (Mike) Newman, Manager of the Computer Section of the Utilities and Energy Management Department at [[Cornell University]], served as the BACnet committee chairman until June, 2000, when he was succeeded by his vice-chair of 13 years, Steven (Steve) Bushby from [[NIST]]. 

During Steve Bushby's four-year term as committee chair the BACnet standard was republished twice, in 2001 and 2004, each time with new capabilities added to the standard. The 2001 version featured, among other things, extensions to support fire / life-safety systems. 

In June, 2004, 17 years after the first BACnet meeting and back in Nashville, William (Bill) Swan (a.k.a. "BACnet Bill") from Alerton began his four-year stint as committee chair. During his term the number of committee working groups grew to 11, pursuing areas such as support for lighting, access control, energy utility/building integration and wireless communications.  

In January 2006 the BACnet Manufacturers Association and the BACnet Interest Group of North America combined their operation in a new organization called [http://www.bacnetinternational.org/ BACnet International].

In June 2008, in Salt Lake City, Dave Robin from Automated Logic Corporation took over the reins as the new committee chair after serving 4 years as vice chair. During Dave's term, 22 addenda were published for the 135-2008 standard and republished as 135-2010. Several addenda were published for 135-2010 and the standard was republished as 135-2012. 

In June 2012, in San Antonio, Carl Neilson from Delta Controls took over the reins as the new committee chair after serving 4 years as vice chair. During Carl's term, 12 addenda were published for the 135-2012 standard and the it was republished as 135-2016. Carl stepped down as chair in June 2015.  

In June 2015, Bernhard Isler, from Siemens, became chair after serving 3 years as vice chair and 4 years as secretary. During Bernhard's term, 10 addenda were published for the 135-2016 standard. Once addenda to 135.1-2013 was also published. Bernhard stepped down as chair in June 2018.

In June 2018, Michael Osborne from Reliable Controls, became chair after serving 3 years as secretary and 3 years as vice chair.

==Protocol overview==
The BACnet protocol defines a number of services that are used to communicate between building devices. The protocol services include Who-Is, I-Am, Who-Has, I-Have, which are used for Device and Object discovery. Services such as Read-Property and Write-Property are used for data sharing. As of ANSI/ASHRAE 135-2016, the BACnet protocol defines 60 object types that are acted upon by the services. 

The BACnet protocol defines a number of data link / physical layers, including [[ARCNET]], [[Ethernet]], BACnet/IP, BACnet/IPv6, [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|Point-To-Point]] over [[RS-232]], Master-Slave/Token-Passing over [[RS-485]], [[ZigBee]], and [[LonTalk]].

==BACnet objects==
ANSI/ASHRAE 135-2016 specifies 60 standard object types:

==BACnet testing==
BACnet Testing Laboratories ("BTL") was established by BACnet International to test products as per BACnet standard and support compliance testing and interoperability testing activities and consists of BTL Manager and the BTL working group ("BTL-WG").
The general activities of the BTL are:
*Publish the BTL Implementation Guidelines document
*Certifying the products as per BACnet testing and BTL guidelines
*Support the activities of the BTL-WG
*Maintain the BTL test packages
*Approves Testing Laboratories for BTL Testing
The BTL also provides testing services through BACnet Laboratories. The BTL Managers and BTL working groups of BACnet International administer the test Laboratories. All BTL-recognized BACnet Test Organizations are [[ISO 17025]] accredited.

In January, 2017, a new BTL certification program was announced. Under this program, the work of the BTL and WSPCert (the European BACnet certification body) is merged. This merger forms a single point of testing for both the BTL Mark and the Certificate of Conformance.

The '''Bioinformatics Open Source Conference''' ('''BOSC''') is an [[academic conference]] on [[open-source programming]] in [[bioinformatics]] organised by the [[Open Bioinformatics Foundation]]. The conference has been held annually since 2000 and is run as a two-day satellite meeting preceding the [[Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology]] (ISMB) conference.

== Program ==
The conference is held as a single track consisting of presentations, [[poster session]]s and two [[keynote|keynote talks]] by people of influence in open-source bioinformatics.&lt;ref name=bosc-2013-report&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harris|first1=N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7017">'''Homeobox protein CDX-4''' is a [[protein]] that in humans is encoded by the CDX4 [[gene]]. This gene is a member of the [[Caudal (protein)|caudal]]-related [[homeobox]] [[transcription factor]] family that also includes CDX1 and CDX2.&lt;ref name="entrez"&gt;{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: CDX1 caudal type homeobox transcription factor 4| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=1046| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transcription factor encoded by the CDX4 gene participates in the formation of extra-embryonic tissues, anterior-posterior patterning and blood formation during embryogenesis.  It does so through the regulation of Hox gene expression. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nes|first1=Johan van|last2=Graaff|first2=Wim de|last3=Lebrin|first3=Franck|last4=Gerhard|first4=Markus|last5=Beck|first5=Felix|last6=Deschamps|first6=Jacqueline|title=The Cdx4 mutation affects axial development and reveals an essential role of Cdx genes in the ontogenesis of the placental labyrinth in mice|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/133/3/419|website=Development|pages=419–428|language=en|doi=10.1242/dev.02216|date=1 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ven|first1=Cesca van de|last2=Bialecka|first2=Monika|last3=Neijts|first3=Roel|last4=Young|first4=Teddy|last5=Rowland|first5=Jennifer E.|last6=Stringer|first6=Emma J.|last7=Rooijen|first7=Carina Van|last8=Meijlink|first8=Frits|last9=Nóvoa|first9=Ana|last10=Freund|first10=Jean-Noel|last11=Mallo|first11=Moises|last12=Beck|first12=Felix|last13=Deschamps|first13=Jacqueline|title=Concerted involvement of Cdx/Hox genes and Wnt signaling in morphogenesis of the caudal neural tube and cloacal derivatives from the posterior growth zone|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/138/16/3451.long|website=Development|pages=3451–3462|language=en|doi=10.1242/dev.066118|date=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davidson|first1=Alan J.|last2=Ernst|first2=Patricia|last3=Wang|first3=Yuan|last4=Dekens|first4=Marcus P.

Before placentation takes place, CDX4 plays a role in its development.  CDX4 mutants are born healthy and are fertile, however its importance is revealed in compound CDX mutants.  Compound mutants carrying one CDX2 null allele and homozygous null for CDX4 fail to generate posterior tissue caudal to the hindlimbs and most of these embryos die around embryonic day 10.5 from lack of placental development. Around 10% of this phenotype may progress to full term, but then die shortly after birth.  Upon inspection the morphogenesis of ano-rectal and urethral tissues was observed. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nes|first1=Johan van|last2=Graaff|first2=Wim de|last3=Lebrin|first3=Franck|last4=Gerhard|first4=Markus|last5=Beck|first5=Felix|last6=Deschamps|first6=Jacqueline|title=The Cdx4 mutation affects axial development and reveals an essential role of Cdx genes in the ontogenesis of the placental labyrinth in mice|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/133/3/419|website=Development|pages=419–428|language=en|doi=10.1242/dev.02216|date=1 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ven|first1=Cesca van de|last2=Bialecka|first2=Monika|last3=Neijts|first3=Roel|last4=Young|first4=Teddy|last5=Rowland|first5=Jennifer E.|last6=Stringer|first6=Emma J.|last7=Rooijen|first7=Carina Van|last8=Meijlink|first8=Frits|last9=Nóvoa|first9=Ana|last10=Freund|first10=Jean-Noel|last11=Mallo|first11=Moises|last12=Beck|first12=Felix|last13=Deschamps|first13=Jacqueline|title=Concerted involvement of Cdx/Hox genes and Wnt signaling in morphogenesis of the caudal neural tube and cloacal derivatives from the posterior growth zone|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/138/16/3451.long|website=Development|pages=3451–3462|language=en|doi=10.1242/dev.066118|date=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most well described function of CDX genes are their role in caudal body formation.  Transcription factors of the CDX gene family, in part control Hox gene expression by responding to signaling molecules Retinoic Acid, Wnt, and FGF.  The redundant contribution of CDX4 in axial elongation is shown in that neither CDX4 null or CDX1/CDX4 compound mutants appear with impaired axial elongation.  However, CDX4 does have a role in determining pancreatic B-cell number, specifying anterior-posterior location of the foregut organs including the pancreas and liver.  Thus, an abnormal state is shown in embryos deficient in CDX4 by posteriorly shifted pancreas, liver and small intestines. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ven|first1=Cesca van de|last2=Bialecka|first2=Monika|last3=Neijts|first3=Roel|last4=Young|first4=Teddy|last5=Rowland|first5=Jennifer E.|last6=Stringer|first6=Emma J.|last7=Rooijen|first7=Carina Van|last8=Meijlink|first8=Frits|last9=Nóvoa|first9=Ana|last10=Freund|first10=Jean-Noel|last11=Mallo|first11=Moises|last12=Beck|first12=Felix|last13=Deschamps|first13=Jacqueline|title=Concerted involvement of Cdx/Hox genes and Wnt signaling in morphogenesis of the caudal neural tube and cloacal derivatives from the posterior growth zone|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/138/16/3451.long|website=Development|pages=3451–3462|language=en|doi=10.1242/dev.066118|date=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kinkel|first1=Mary D.|last2=Eames|first2=Stefani C.|last3=Alonzo|first3=Martha R.|last4=Prince|first4=Victoria E.|title=Cdx4 is required in the endoderm to localize the pancreas and limitβ -cell number|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/135/5/919|website=Development|pages=919–929|language=en|doi=10.1242/dev.010660|date=1 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In blood formation, CDX4 regulation of Hox genes is necessary for the specification of hematopoietic cell fate during embryogenesis.  This is demonstrated by the fact that blood deficiencies in CDX4 mutants can be rescued by the over expression of certain Hox genes. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davidson|first1=Alan J.|last2=Ernst|first2=Patricia|last3=Wang|first3=Yuan|last4=Dekens|first4=Marcus P.

The '''Caravaggisti''' (or the "Caravagesques") were stylistic followers of the 16th-century Italian [[Baroque]] painter [[Caravaggio]]. His influence on the new Baroque style that eventually emerged from [[Mannerism]] was profound. Caravaggio never established a workshop as most other painters did, and thus had no school to spread his techniques. Nor did he ever set out his underlying philosophical approach to art, the [[psychological fiction|psychological realism]] which can only be deduced from his surviving work. But it can be seen directly or indirectly in the work of [[Rubens]], [[Jusepe de Ribera]], [[Bernini]], and [[Rembrandt]]. Famous while he lived, Caravaggio himself was forgotten almost immediately after his death. Many of his paintings were reascribed to his followers, such as ''[[The Taking of Christ (Caravaggio)|The Taking of Christ]]'', which was attributed to the Dutch painter [[Gerrit van Honthorst]] until 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Jonathan|last=Harr|authorlink=Jonathan Harr|title=[[The Lost Painting: The Quest for a Caravaggio Masterpiece]]|publisher=Random House|year=2005|isbn=0-375-50801-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only in the 20th century that his importance to the development of Western art was rediscovered. In the 1920s [[Fondazione Roberto Longhi|Roberto Longhi]] once more placed him in the European tradition: "Ribera, [[Vermeer]], La Tour and Rembrandt could never have existed without him. And the art of [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] and [[Édouard Manet|Manet]] would have been utterly different".&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Longhi, quoted in Lambert, op. cit., p.15&lt;/ref&gt; The influential [[Bernard Berenson]] stated: "With the exception of [[Michelangelo]], no other Italian painter exercised so great an influence."&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Berenson, in Lambert, op. cit., p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italian==

===Rome===
At the height of his popularity in [[Rome]] during the late 1590s and early 17th century, Caravaggio's dramatic new style influenced many of his peers in the Roman art world. The first Caravaggisti included [[Mario Minniti]], [[Giovanni Baglione]] (although his Caravaggio phase was short-lived), [[Leonello Spada]] and [[Orazio Gentileschi]]. In the next generation there were [[Carlo Saraceni]], [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]] and [[Orazio Borgianni]] as well as anonymous masters such as the [[Master of the Gamblers]]. Gentileschi, despite being considerably older, was the only one of these artists to live much beyond 1620, and ended up as court painter to [[Charles I of England]]. His daughter [[Artemisia Gentileschi]] was also close to Caravaggio, and one of the most gifted of the movement. Yet in Rome and in Italy it was not Caravaggio, but the influence of [[Annibale Carracci]], blending elements from the [[High Renaissance]] and [[Lombardy|Lombard]] realism, which ultimately triumphed. Other artists active in Rome, worth mentioning, include [[Angelo Caroselli]], [[Pier Francesco Mola]], [[Tommaso Salini]] and [[Francesco Buoneri]]. [[Giacinto Brandi]] was active mainly in Rome and Naples. Dutch painter [[David de Haen]] was active in Rome between 1615 and 1622.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Naples===
In May 1606 after the killing of Ranuccio Tomassoni, Caravaggio fled to [[Naples]] with a [[Caravaggio#Exile and death (1606–1610)|death sentence on his head]].&lt;ref name=PUGLISI&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caravaggio|year=1998|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=0-7148-3966-3|author=Catherine Puglisi}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there he completed several commissions, two major ones being the ''[[Madonna of the Rosary (Caravaggio)|Madonna of the Rosary]]'', and ''[[The Seven Works of Mercy (Caravaggio)|The Seven Works of Mercy]]''.&lt;ref name=PUGLISI/&gt; His work had a profound effect on the local artists and his brief stay in Naples produced a notable school of Neapolitan Caravaggisti, including [[Battistello Caracciolo]], [[Bernardo Cavallino]], [[Carlo Sellitto]], [[Massimo Stanzione]], [[Francesco Guarino]], [[Andrea Vaccaro]], [[Cesare Fracanzano]] and [[Antonio de Bellis]]. [[Giacinto Brandi]] was active mainly in Rome and Naples. The Caravaggisti movement there ended with a terrible outbreak of plague in 1656, but at the time Naples was a possession of Spain and the influence of Caravaggism had already spread there.

===Northern Italy===
[[Marco Antonio Bassetti]] is known to have been in Rome in 1616, and may have arrived there two years earlier. In Rome he came under the influence of the paintings of Caravaggio and Orazio Borgianni. On his return to [[Verona]] he painted a St. Peter and Saints for the church of San Tomaso and a Coronation of the Virgin for Sant' Anastasia. He died from the plague in Verona in 1630. 

[[Bernardo Strozzi]], born and mainly active in [[Genoa]] and later [[Venice]], is considered a principal founder of the Venetian Baroque style.  In the 1620s Strozzi gradually abandoned his early [[Mannerist]] style in favor of a more personal style characterized by a new naturalism derived from the work of Caravaggio and his followers. The Caravaggist style of painting had been brought to Genoa both by [[Domenico Fiasella]], after his return from Rome in 1617–18, and by followers of Caravaggio who spent time working in the city.

Italian painter [[Biagio Manzoni]] was active in [[Faenza]]. Italian painter from [[Reggio Emilia]] [[Bartolomeo Schedoni]], [[Daniele Crespi]] from [[Milan]] and [[Luca Cambiasi]], also known as Luca Cambiaso and Luca Cangiagio, the leading artist in [[Genoa]] in the 16th century, often depicted  brilliantly lit figures set against a dark background. [[Felice Boselli]], active in [[Piacenza]], used contrast Caravaggisti lighting for his still-lifes. [[Tanzio da Varallo]] (or simply il Tanzio) was active mainly in [[Lombardy]] and [[Piedmont]], including the [[Sacro Monte]] at [[Varallo Sesia]], where he worked contemporaneously with [[Pier Francesco Mazzucchelli]] (il Morazzone). The Italian painter and engraver [[Bernardino Mei]] worked in his native [[Siena]] and in Rome, finding patronage above all in the Chigi family.

===Central Italy===
[[Pietro Ricchi]] (or  il Lucchesino), born in [[Lucca]], also often depicted  brilliantly lit figures set against a dark background (see St. Sebastian).

===Sicily===
[[Mario Minniti]] was an Italian artist active in Sicily after 1606. He, at the age of 16, even posed for Caravaggio's painting [[Boy with a Basket of Fruit]].

==Dutch==
The [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] lists 128 artists labelled "Caravaggisten".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rkd.nl/rkddb/dispatcher.aspx?action=search&amp;search=school_stroming=%22Caravaggisten%22&amp;database=ChoiceArtists&amp;id=1 Caravaggisten] in the [[RKD]].&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch painter [[David de Haen]] was active in Rome between 1615 and 1622. Another artist worth mentioning is [[Paulus Bor]], who  initially painted rather Caravaggisti-like history paintings, but his works fast became marked by a classicism related to that of his townsman van Campen. [[Abraham Lambertsz van den Tempel]] is worth mentioning for his realism and contrasting lighting. Flemish born painter [[Frans Badens]] was active in Amsterdam. 

===Utrecht===
{{main|Utrecht Caravaggism}}
In the early 17th century Catholic artists from the [[Netherlands]] travelled to Rome as students and were profoundly influenced by the work of Caravaggio. On their return to the north this group, known as the [[Utrecht Caravaggism|"Utrecht Caravaggisti"]], had a short-lived but influential flowering in the 1620s among painters like [[Hendrick ter Brugghen]], [[Gerrit van Honthorst]], [[Andries Both]] and [[Dirck van Baburen]]. The brief flourishing of Utrecht Caravaggism ended around 1630, when major artists had either died, as in the case of Baburen and Terbrugghen, or had changed style, like van Honthorst's shift to [[portrait painting|portraiture]] and history scenes informed by the [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish]] tendencies popularized by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] and his followers. In the following generation the effects of Caravaggio, although attenuated, are to be seen in the work of [[Vermeer]], [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], and [[Gerrit Dou]]'s "niche paintings".

==Flemish==
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Cain slaying Abel, 1608-1609.jpg|thumb|''Cain slaying Abel'', Rubens, 1608-1609]]
Rubens was likely one of the first Flemish artists to be influenced by [[Caravaggio]].  During the period 1600-1608, Rubens resided in Italy.  He settled in [[Mantua]] at the court of Duke [[Vincenzo I of Gonzaga|Vincenzo&amp;nbsp;I Gonzaga]] but also spent time in Rome. During his stay in Rome in 1601 he became acquainted with Caravaggio’s work.  He later made a copy of Caravagio's ''[[The Entombment of Christ (Caravaggio)|Entombment of Christ]]'' and recommended his patron, the Duke of Mantua, to purchase [[Death of the Virgin (Caravaggio)|''The Death of the Virgin'']] ([[Louvre]]).  Rubens was after his return to Antwerp instrumental in the acquisition of [[Madonna of the Rosary (Caravaggio)|''The Madonna of the Rosary'']] ([[Kunsthistorisches Museum|Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna]]) for the [[St. Paul's Church, Antwerp|St. Paul's Church]] in Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Sirjacobs, Raymond. ''Antwerpen Sint-Pauluskerk: Rubens En De Mysteries Van De Rozenkrans = Rubens Et Les Mystères Du Rosaire = Rubens and the Mysteries of the Rosary'', Antwerpen: Sint-Paulusvrienden, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  During his stay in Italy Rubens broadened his interest in Caravaggio’s work to include the 1606 ''[[Supper at Emmaus (Caravaggio), Milan|Supper at Emmaus in Milan]]'' ([[Pinacoteca di Brera]]) and the 1600 ''[[The Calling of St Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Calling of St Matthew]]'' as well as the more recent work in the [[Santa Maria in Vallicella]] and the [[Basilica of Sant'Agostino]]. Although some of this interest in Caravaggio is reflected in his drawings during his Italian residence, it was only after his return to Antwerp in 1608 that his works show openly Caravaggesque traits such as in the ''[[:File:Peter Paul Rubens - Cain slaying Abel, 1608-1609.jpg|Cain slaying Abel]]'' (1608-1609) ([[Courtauld Institute of Art]]).  However, the influence of Caravaggio on Rubens’ work would be less important than that of [[Raphael]], [[Antonio da Correggio|Correggio]], [[Federico Barocci|Barocci]] and the Venetians.&lt;ref&gt;Gregori, Mina, Luigi Salerno, and Richard E. Spear, ''The Age of Caravaggio'', Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Artists, who were influenced by Rubens, such as [[Pieter van Mol]], [[Gaspar de Crayer]] and [[Willem Jacob Herreyns]], also used certain stark realism and strong contrasts of light and shadow, common to Caravaggisti style. 

Rubens' contemporary [[Abraham Janssens]] was another Flemish painter who travelled to Italy (from 1597 to 1602) where he became acquainted with the work of Caravaggio.  His work after his return to Antwerp shows the influence of Caravaggio.  The composition ''[[:Image:Abraham Janssens 001.jpg|Scaldis and Antwerpia]]'' of 1609 derives its expressive power from the use of strong contrasts of light and shadow ([[chiaroscuro]]) as was pioneered by Caravaggio.&lt;ref name=sca&gt;[http://www.okv.be/OKV-artikel/abraham-janssens-scaldis-en-antwerpia Roger A. d'Hulst, ''Abraham Janssens - Scaldis en Antwerpia''] at Openbaar Kunstbezit Vlaanderen {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is mainly the Flemish artists from the generation after Rubens coming on the art scene in the 1620s who were most influenced by Caravaggio.  It can even be said that there was a Caravaggist craze in Flanders from about 1620 to 1640.&lt;ref name=rombouts&gt;[http://barokinvlaanderen.vlaamsekunstcollectie.be/en/biography/theodoor-rombouts Matthias Depoorter, ''Theodoor Rombouts'' on vlaamsekunstcollectie.be]&lt;/ref&gt;  The artists are often referred to as the Ghent Caravaggisti and the Antwerp Caravaggisti after the city in which they were principally active. There is, however, no discernible stylistic distinction between these two movements other than individual ones.  Among the Ghent Caravaggisti can be listed [[Jan Janssens]], [[Melchior de la Mars]] and [[Antoon van den Heuvel]].  The list of Antwerp Caravaggisti is significantly longer reflecting the importance of this city as the pre-eminent artistic centre of Flanders.  They include [[Theodoor Rombouts]], [[Gerard Seghers]], [[Jan Cossiers]], [[Adam de Coster]] and [[Jacques de l'Ange]].

What most of these artists shared in common is that they likely visited Italy where they had first-hand contact with the work of Caravaggio or his Italian and Dutch followers.  The influence of Caravaggio and his followers on their work can be seen in the use of dramatic light effects and expressive gestures as well as the new subject matter such as card sharps, fortune tellers, the denial of St Peter, etc.&lt;ref name=rombouts/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://barokinvlaanderen.vlaamsekunstcollectie.be/en/biography/jan-janssens ''Jan Janssens'' on vlaamsekunstcollectie.be]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=seghers&gt;[http://barokinvlaanderen.vlaamsekunstcollectie.be/en/biography/gerard-seghers Matthias Depoorter, ''Gerard Seghers'' on vlaamsekunstcollectie.be]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the artists focused on certain aspects of Caravaggio's oeuvre.  For instance, Adam de Coster was referred to as the ''Pictor Noctium'' (painter of the nights) because of his preference for the use of stark chiaroscuro and the repeated motif of half-length figures illuminated by a candle which is covered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2008/old-master-paintings-n08453/lot.58.html Adam de Coster, ''The Denial of Saint Peter''] at [[Sotheby's]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these artists such as Rombouts, Cossiers and Seghers later abandoned their strict adherence to the Caravaggist style and subject matter and struck out in different directions often under the influence of the older generation of Flemish artists who had such a dominant influence on Flemish art in the 17th century, i.e. Rubens and [[Anthony van Dyck|van Dyck]].&lt;ref name=rombouts/&gt;&lt;ref name=seghers/&gt;

==French==
One of the first [[France|French]] artists to studio in Rome during the Caravaggio Years was [[Jean LeClerc (painter)|Jean LeClerc]], who studied under Saraceni during the early 17th century. [[Simon Vouet]] spent an extensive period of time in Italy, from 1613 to 1627. His patrons included the [[Barberini family]], [[Cassiano dal Pozzo]], [[Paolo Giordano II Orsini|Paolo Giordano Orsini]] and [[Vincenzo Giustiniani]].&lt;ref&gt;Brejon de Lavergnée, Barbara. 'Simon Vouet', ''Oxford Art Online''.&lt;/ref&gt; He also visited other parts of Italy: [[Venice]]; [[Bologna]], (where the [[Annibale Carracci|Carracci family]] had their academy); [[Genoa]], (where from 1620 to 1622, he worked for the [[Doria (family)|Doria princes]]); and Naples. He absorbed what he saw and distilled it in his painting: Caravaggio's dramatic lighting; Italian Mannerism; [[Paolo Veronese]]'s color and ''[[di sotto in su]]'' or foreshortened perspective; and the art of [[Annibale Carracci|Carracci]], [[Guercino]], [[Giovanni Lanfranco|Lanfranco]] and [[Guido Reni]]. Vouet's success in Rome led to his election as president of the [[Accademia di San Luca]] in 1624. Despite his success in Rome, Vouet returned to France in 1627. Vouet's new style was distinctly Italian, importing the Italian Baroque style into France. Other French artists enamored by the new style included [[Valentin de Boulogne]], who was living in Rome by 1620, and studied under Vouet and later Boulognes pupil [[Nicolas Tournier]].

[[Georges de La Tour]] is assumed to have travelled either to Italy or the Netherlands early in his career. His paintings reflect the influence of Caravaggio, but this probably reached him through the Dutch ''Caravaggisti'' and other Northern ([[List of French artists|French]] and [[List of Dutch painters|Dutch]]) contemporaries. In particular, La Tour is often compared to the Dutchman [[Hendrick Terbrugghen]].&lt;ref name="AB"&gt;Anthony Blunt, "Art and Architecture in France, 1500–1700", 1953, Penguin&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Finson]], also known as Ludovicus Finsonius, was a Flemish Baroque painter, who also worked in France.

==Spanish==
[[Francisco Ribalta]] became among the first followers in [[Spanish Golden Age|Spain]] of the [[Tenebrism|tenebrist]] style. It is unclear if he directly visited either [[Rome]] or [[Naples]], where Caravaggio's style had many adherents, although through its Naples connection Spain was probably already exposed to Caravaggisim by the early 17th century. His son [[Juan Ribalta]], [[Vicente Castelló]] and [[Jusepe de Ribera]] are said to have been his pupils, although it is entirely possible that Ribera acquired his tenebrism when he moved to Italy. The style garnered a number of adherents in Spain, and was to influence the Baroque or [[Golden Age]] Spanish painters, especially [[Zurbarán]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]] and [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]]. Even the art of still life in Spain, the [[bodegón]] was often painted in a similar stark and austere style. [[Orazio Borgianni]] signed a petition to begin an Italianate academy of painting in Spain and executed a series of nine paintings for the Convento de Portacoeli, Valladolid, where they remain. [[Giovanni Battista Crescenzi]] was an Italian painter and architect of the early-Baroque period, active in Rome and Spain, where he helped decorate the pantheon of the Spanish kings at El Escorial. He rose to prominence as an artist during the reign of Pope Paul V, but by 1617 had moved to Madrid, and from 1620 on, he was active in El Escorial. Philip III of Spain awarded him the title of Marchese de la Torre, Knight of Santiago. His pupil [[Bartolomeo Cavarozzi]] was active in Spain.

{{English grammar}}

In [[corpus linguistics]], a '''collocation''' is a sequence of words or [[terminology|terms]] that [[co-occurrence|co-occur]] more often than would be expected by chance. In [[phraseology]], '''collocation''' is a sub-type of [[phraseme]]. An example of a phraseological collocation, as propounded by  [[Michael Halliday]],&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K., 'Lexis as a Linguistic Level', Journal of Linguistics 2(1) 1966: 57-67&lt;/ref&gt; is the expression ''strong tea''. While the same meaning could be conveyed by the roughly equivalent ''powerful tea'', this expression is considered excessive and awkward by English speakers. Conversely, the corresponding expression in technology, ''powerful computer'' is preferred over ''strong computer''. Phraseological collocations should not be confused with [[idiom]]s, where an idiom's meaning is derived from its convention as a stand-in for something else while collocation is a mere popular composition.

There are about six main types of collocations: adjective+noun, noun+noun (such as [[collective nouns]]), verb+noun, adverb+adjective, verbs+prepositional phrase ([[phrasal verb]]s), and verb+adverb.

[[Collocation extraction]] is a computational technique that finds collocations in a document or corpus, using various [[computational linguistics]] elements resembling [[data mining]].

==Expanded definition==
Collocations are partly or fully fixed expressions that become established through repeated context-dependent use. Such terms as 'crystal clear', 'middle management', 'nuclear family', and 'cosmetic surgery' are examples of collocated pairs of words.

Collocations can be in a [[syntax|syntactic]] relation (such as [[subject–verb–object|verb–object]]: 'make' and 'decision'), [[lexicon|lexical]] relation (such as [[antonymy]]), or they can be in no linguistically defined relation.  Knowledge of collocations is vital for the competent use of a language: a [[grammar|grammatically]] correct sentence will stand out as awkward if collocational preferences are violated.  This makes collocation an interesting area for language teaching. Recently, a mobile version of Collocation Dictionary was published on Google Play.&lt;ref&gt;[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.idiotsapps.oxford.collocation.dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Corpus linguists specify a [[Keyword (linguistics)|key word]] in context ([[key word in context|KWIC]]) and identify the words immediately surrounding them.  This gives an idea of the way words are used.

The processing of collocations involves a number of parameters, the most important of which is the ''measure of association'', which evaluates whether the [[co-occurrence]] is purely by chance or statistically [[Statistical significance|significant]].  Due to the non-random nature of language, most collocations are classed as significant, and the association scores are simply used to rank the results.  Commonly used measures of association include [[mutual information]], [[Student's t-test|t scores]], and [[log-likelihood]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunning, Ted (1993): "[http://aclweb.org/anthology/J/J93/J93-1003.pdf Accurate methods for the statistics of surprise and coincidence]". [[Computational Linguistics (journal)|Computational Linguistics]] 19, 1 (Mar. 1993), 61-74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tdunning.blogspot.com/2008/03/surprise-and-coincidence.html |title=Surprise and Coincidence |author=Dunning, Ted|date=2008-03-21 |publisher=blogspot.com |accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than select a single definition, Gledhill&lt;ref&gt;Gledhill C. (2000): Collocations in Science Writing, Narr, Tübingen&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that collocation involves at least three different perspectives: (i) co-occurrence, a statistical view, which sees collocation as the recurrent appearance in a text of a node and its collocates,&lt;ref&gt;Firth J.R. (1957): Papers in Linguistics 1934–1951. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair J. (1996): "The Search for Units of Meaning", in Textus, IX, 75–106.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smadja F. A &amp; McKeown, K. R. (1990): "[http://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P90/P90-1032.pdf Automatically extracting and representing collocations for language generation]", Proceedings of ACL'90, 252–259, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt; (ii) construction, which sees collocation either as a correlation between a lexeme and a lexical-grammatical pattern,&lt;ref&gt;Hunston S. &amp; Francis G. (2000): Pattern Grammar — A Corpus-Driven Approach to the Lexical Grammar of English, Amsterdam, John Benjamins&lt;/ref&gt; or as a relation between a base and its collocative partners&lt;ref&gt;Hausmann F. J. (1989): Le dictionnaire de collocations. In Hausmann F.J., Reichmann O., Wiegand H.E., Zgusta L.(eds), Wörterbücher : ein internationales Handbuch zur Lexikographie. Dictionaries. Dictionnaires. Berlin/New-York : De Gruyter. 1010-1019.&lt;/ref&gt; and (iii) expression, a pragmatic view of collocation as a conventional unit of expression, regardless of form.&lt;ref&gt;
Moon R. (1998): Fixed Expressions and Idioms, a Corpus-Based Approach. Oxford, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frath P. &amp; Gledhill C. (2005): "Free-Range Clusters or Frozen Chunks? Reference as a Defining Criterion for Linguistic Units," in Recherches anglaises et Nord-américaines, vol. 38 :25–43&lt;/ref&gt; It should be pointed out here that these different perspectives contrast with the usual way of presenting collocation in phraseological studies. Traditionally speaking, collocation is explained in terms of all three perspectives at once, in a continuum:

:'Free Combination' ↔ 'Bound Collocation' ↔ 'Frozen Idiom'

==In dictionaries==

In 1933, [[Harold E. Palmer|Harold Palmer]]'s ''Second Interim Report on English Collocations'' highlighted the importance of collocation as a key to producing natural-sounding language, for anyone learning a [[foreign language]].&lt;ref&gt;Cowie, A.P., English Dictionaries for Foreign Learners, Oxford University Press 1999:54-56&lt;/ref&gt; Thus from the 1940s onwards, information about recurrent word combinations became a standard feature of [[Monolingual learner's dictionary|monolingual learner's dictionaries]]. As these dictionaries became 'less word-centred and more phrase-centred',&lt;ref&gt;Bejoint, H., The Lexicography of English, Oxford University Press 2010: 318&lt;/ref&gt; more attention was paid to collocation. This trend was supported, from the beginning of the 21st century, by the availability of large text [[Corpus linguistics|corpora]] and intelligent [[Text_mining|corpus-querying software]], making possible to provide a more systematic account of collocation in dictionaries. Using these tools, dictionaries such as the ''[[Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners|Macmillan English Dictionary]]'' and the ''[[Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English]]'' included boxes or panels with lists of frequent collocations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionaries.com/about/med/key-features-of-the-macmillan-english-dictionary-second-edition/#7|title=MED Second Edition - Key features - Macmillan|work=macmillandictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also a number of [[Specialized dictionary|specialized dictionaries]] devoted to describing the frequent collocations in a language.&lt;ref&gt;Herbst, T. and Klotz, M. 'Syntagmatic and Phraseological Dictionaries' in Cowie, A.P. (Ed.) The Oxford History of English Lexicography, 2009: part 2, 234-243&lt;/ref&gt; These include (for Spanish) ''Redes: Diccionario combinatorio del español contemporaneo'' (2004),  (for French) ''Le Robert: Dictionnaire des combinaisons de mots'' (2007), and (for English) the ''LTP Dictionary of Selected Collocations'' (1997) and the ''Macmillan Collocations Dictionary'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionaries.com/features/how-dictionaries-are-written/macmillan-collocations-dictionary/|title=Macmillan Collocation Dictionary - How it was written  - Macmillan|work=macmillandictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistically significant collocation ==
[[Student's t-test]] can be used to determine whether the occurrence of a collocation in a corpus is statistically significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing|last=Manning|first=Chris|last2=Schütze|first2=Hinrich|publisher=MIT Press|year=1999|isbn=0262133601|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=163–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a [[bigram]] &lt;math&gt;w_1w_2&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;P(w_1) = \frac{\#w_1}{N}&lt;/math&gt; be the unconditional probability of occurrence of &lt;math&gt;w_1&lt;/math&gt; in a corpus with size &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;P(w_2) = \frac{\#w_2}{N}&lt;/math&gt; be the unconditional probability of occurrence of &lt;math&gt;w_2&lt;/math&gt; in the corpus. Then the t-score for the bigram &lt;math&gt;w_1w_2&lt;/math&gt; is calculated as:

&lt;math&gt;t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sqrt{\frac{s^2}{N}}}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bar{x} = \frac{\# w_iw_j}{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the sample mean of the occurrence of &lt;math&gt;w_1w_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\#w_1w_2&lt;/math&gt; is the number of occurrences of &lt;math&gt;w_1w_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu = P(w_i)P(w_j)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of &lt;math&gt;w_1w_2&lt;/math&gt; under the null-hypothesis that &lt;math&gt;w_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_2&lt;/math&gt; appear independently in the text, and &lt;math&gt;s^2 = \bar{x}(1-\bar{x}) \approx \bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the sample variance. With a large &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, the t-test is equivalent to a [[z-test]].

In [[semiotics]], the '''commutation test''' is used to analyze a signifying system. The test identifies signifiers as well as their signifieds, [[value (Semiotics)|value]] and significance.

==The commutation test==
This test is a metalingual subjective system for analysing textual or other material. It has evolved from a limited method for investigating the structure of individual signs (per [[Roman Jakobson]]). Its primary uses are to: 
*identify distinctive signifiers,
*define their significance, and
*divide material into paradigmatic classes and identify the codes to which the signifiers belong ([[Roland Barthes]]).
The initial assumption is that the communication to be analysed represents both a cognitive use of the sign system and a statement that refers to the values of the addresser. The purpose of the test is therefore to illuminate the addresser's intention in using the code in this particular way. It works through a process of substitution, assessing the extent to which a change in the signifier leads to a change in the signified. The first step, therefore, is to exclude one signifier from the material to be analysed. This is a test of redundancy: to identify what meaning is lost (if any) by omitting that sign. It will be relatively unusual to find that one sign is completely superfluous, but more common to find that the contribution of the one sign to the whole meaning is relatively weak. The weakness or strength of its contribution can be calibrated more exactly by placing alternate (synonymous and antonymous) signs in the context. This will enable the analyst to make a judgment on the distinctiveness of the particular signifier chosen by the author/artist and of its value to the meaning, i.e. as more or less necessary for maintaining the meaning and/or rule structure in different occurrences. By changing the collocation between two of the existing signifiers, and so changing their original relationship, the relative significance of each signifier can be considered. Further, by also placing the original sign into different contexts, it can be seen whether the sign becomes more or less distinctive.

==The process==
The nature of the process will be determined by the form of the media to be analysed. In textual or pictorial media where individuals are the theme of the content, this might involve a substitution of words that are synonymous, or of imagery parallel in classes representing age, gender, ethnicity, religion, ability, etc. to assess the extent to which overall meaning is affected. In visual media generally, substituting different [[mise en scène]]s or backgrounds may change the significance of objects or people in the foreground. Colour selections may affect the perceived attractiveness of the scene or of individuals whose clothing is changed. The presence or absence of branded or generic goods, of stylish or outmoded clothing, etc. may help to suggest the contribution of the original signifier.

According to Daniel Chandler, the commutation test may involve any of four basic transformations which, to a greater or lesser extent, involve modification of the syntagm:
*Paradigmatic transformations
**[[:wikt:substitution|substitution]];
**[[:wikt:transpose|transposition]]
*Syntagmatic transformations
**[[addition]];
**[[wikt:deletion|deletion]].

==An example==
Take the phrase:
:the man hit the boy.
Now substitute "boy" with "baby", "girl", "child", "pansy", "thief". Each of these alternatives affects the implication of the phrase. A "man" rather than a father or parent randomly striking a baby or girl might be considered sexist and a crime. If the boy was a thief, this would explain but not excuse the man's behaviour as retaliation or revenge. If the boy is a pansy which has [[pejorative]] connotations of cowardice or homosexuality, the man may be intolerant or overly judgemental but the victim is also presented in a less sympathetic way. The use of child not differentiated by gender is a more common usage in the context of paedophilia. When the signifiers of boy and man are transposed, the relative inequality in strength is also reversed and the interpretation shifts to more playful and less threatening images. Hence, the subjective view may be that the phrase as originally conceived was the most neutral of the possible formulations given the original form. 

If we now contextualise the image in a school, seminary, prison, training gym or home environment different sets of meanings emerge depending on the presence or absence of other signifiers demonstrating the relationship between the protagonists, the time the image was created (a Victorian image of corporal punishment in a school would have a different significance from a more recent image of judicial caning in Britain, Canada or Singapore), the nature of the activity (e.g. a boxing training session or a game of tennis in which the blow is struck accidentally, etc.), the presence or absence of other people, etc.. The values are therefore added or subtracted according to the presence or absence of other signifiers.

==Discussion==
The first stage of development in semiotics related to the spoken and/or written form of [[language]]. Later, it was expanded to cover all [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] systems that have an [[information]]al content. As [[Umberto Eco]] says, "A sign is everything which can be taken as significantly substituting for something else." (1976)

Semiotics studies the relationship between the form of the sign (the ''signifier'') and the [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] expressed (the ''signified''), and thereby attempts to reveal the process of communicating [[understanding]]. In each case, a message is to be sent by an addresser to an addressee. For this to occur, the addresser and addressee must use a common [[code (semiotics)|code]], Hence, language evolves dynamically. The [[community]] will identify a [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] thing that needs to be referred to in their language. By common agreement, a sign (sometimes called a ''signal'') will be selected. Of the many possible shades of meanings that it can be used to convey, one or more will be selected and ''encoded'', i.e. the chosen meaning(s) will be [[denotation (semiotics)|denoted]] or associated with the sign within the broader framework of [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] systems available within the community. When the [[audience]] is exposed to the sign, the expectation is that they will be able to decode the meaning. As [[Roman Jakobson]] adds, there will also be an [[emotion]]al element or [[value (Semiotics)|value]] which represents the addresser's [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]] towards the ''thing''. This will either become a [[connotation (Semiotics)|connotative]] meaning attached directly to the sign itself, or it will be communicated by the context in which the sign is used by the addresser. 

In [[lexicography]], the fact that a  [[neologism]] is used marks its acceptance into the language. This will not be a difficult process so long as each sign has a limited and immediately useful meaning. The problem arises when several possible meanings or shades of meaning become associated with the sign. This is a shift from denotational to connotational meanings. Rules of interpretation are required to resolve uncertainty. Within the community, such rules are, for the most part, experiential and applied without conscious control. Members of a [[community]] have a shared [[memory]] of language [[pattern]]s and [[norm (philosophy)|norm]]s which, for the most part, are stable over long periods of time. [[Individual]]s are therefore able to build up a [[cognitive]] framework which identifies the possible meanings from any grouping of signs and selects one considered the most appropriate from the context. This [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] system is continuously tested through the audience's responses. If the responses are satisfying, intuition prevails. If the responses are obviously inappropriate, the audience will consciously review the thought process and decide whether to modify the framework. Semiotics has developed a more precise methodology for this interpretive process, seeking to expose the unstated habitual practices for interpreting signifiers.

{{globalize|date=December 2010}}
The '''crime against nature''' or '''unnatural act''' has historically been a legal term in [[English language|English]]-speaking [[State (polity)|states]] identifying forms of [[human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]] not considered [[natural]] or decent and are legally punishable [[offence (law)|offenses]].&lt;ref&gt;William Blackstone (1753), [[Commentaries on the Laws of England]], Book 4, Chapter 15, Section 4&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual practices that have historically been considered to be "crimes against nature" include [[anal sex]]&lt;ref name="See Rose v 1975"&gt;See Rose v. Locke, 1975, 96 S.Ct. 243, 423 U.S. 48, 46 L.Ed.2d 185.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zoophilia|bestiality]].&lt;ref name="Andrews v. Vanduzer 1814"&gt;Andrews v. Vanduzer, [[Supreme Court of New York|N.Y.Sup.]] 1814 (January Term, 1814)(Vanduzer accused Andrews of having had connection with a cow and then a mare and the court understood this to mean that Vanduzer was going around telling others that Andrews had been guilty of the crime against nature with a beast.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and terminology==

For much of modern history, a "crime against nature" was understood by courts to be synonymous to "[[buggery]]", and to include [[anal sex]] (copulation ''per anum'') and [[zoophilia|bestiality]].&lt;ref name="See Rose v 1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrews v. Vanduzer 1814"/&gt; Early court decisions agreed that [[fellatio]] (copulation ''per os'') was not included, though mainly because that practice was virtually unknown when the common-law definition was established (it remained so rare that first attempted fellatio prosecutions under the "crime against nature" statute date to 1817 in England and 1893 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Rex v. Samuel Jacobs (1817); Prindle v. State of Texas, 21 S.W. 360 (1893)&lt;/ref&gt;) Likewise, sexual activities between two women were not covered. Over time, particularly starting in the early 20th century, some jurisdictions started enacting statutes or developing precedents the extended the scope of the crime to include fellatio and, sometimes, other sexual activities.

The term ''crime against nature'' is closely related to, and was often used interchangeably with, the term ''[[sodomy]]''. (This varied from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Sometimes the two terms were understood to be synonymous; sometimes sodomy was limited to sexual activities between two humans;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outhistory.org/oldwiki/images/8/81/Ausman_v._Veal,_10_IN_355.pdf|title=Ausman v. Veal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes sodomy was taken to include anal sex or bestiality, whereas ''crime against nature'' also included fellatio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4736&amp;context=jclc|title=The role of common law concepts in modern jurisprudence}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Until the early 19th century, courts were divided on whether the act needed to be completed (to result in ejaculation) in order to be a punishable offense. This question was deemed sufficiently important that, in 1828, English law was explicitly amended to specify that proof of ejaculation was not necessary for convictions for buggery and rape.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite book|title=The American and English Encyclopedia of Law|author= Charles F. Williams|year=1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crime was not limited to same-sex activities, and, in case of an act between two adults, both participants were guilty, regardless of consent. Attempted or completed act of sodomy, committed by a husband against his wife, was grounds for divorce in common law.&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt;

Historically, the offense was usually referred to by its longer name, the ''detestable and abominable'' (or ''abominable and detestable'', or, sometimes, ''infamous'') ''crime against nature, committed with mankind or beast''. This phrase originates in [[Buggery Act 1533]], with words "crime against nature" substituted for "vice of buggery" in the original, and it was present in one of these forms in criminal codes of most U.S. states.  Specific acts included under this heading were typically deemed too detestable to list them explicitly, resulting in a number of vagueness-based legal challenges to corresponding statutes. One of the most recent, and one of the rare successful challenges, is the 1971 Florida case of ''[[Franklin v. State]]''. On the other hand, just 7 years prior, a similar challenge (''Perkins v. State''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/234/333/1671292/|title=Perkins v. State of North Carolina, 234 F. Supp. 333 (W.D.N.C. 1964)}}&lt;/ref&gt;) failed in North Carolina. (In ''Perkins'', the Court wrote that, if this were a new statute, it would have been "obviously unconstitutional for vagueness", but, since this was a statute whose history was traceable back to the reign of [[Henry VIII]], it accumulated a number of judicial interpretations, and, backed with these interpretations, it was not unconstitutionally vague.)

Penalties for this offense varied greatly over time and between jurisdictions. Crime against nature remained punishable by death or life imprisonment both in the UK and in many U.S. states well into the 19th century. Liberalization of sexual morals led to reduction of penalties or decriminalization of the offense during the second half of the 20th century, so that, by 2003, it was no longer a punishable offense in 36 out of 50 U.S. states, and was only punishable by a fine in some of the remaining 14. (See [[Sodomy laws in the United States]] for details.)

==Current use==
Currently, the term crime against nature is still used in the [[statutes]] of the following [[United States|American]] states. However, these laws are unconstitutional to enforce for sexual conduct between consenting adults in light of ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003). The crime against nature statutes are however still used to criminalize sexual conduct involving minors, [[incest]], public sex, [[prostitution]] and [[bestiality]].

==Repeal and unconstitutionality==
Except for the above nine states, all other states in the United States have repealed their "crimes against nature" laws. Furthermore, in 2003, in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', the US Supreme Court held that nonremunerative sex between consenting adults in private was protected by the Constitution and could not be criminalized under "crimes against nature" laws. Thus, fellatio, cunnilingus and homosexual sex can no longer fall within the scope of such laws.

'''Engineering education''' is the activity of [[teaching]] knowledge and principles to the professional practice of [[engineering]]. It includes an initial education ([[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] and/or [[master's degree]]), and any advanced education and specializations that follow. Engineering education is typically accompanied by additional postgraduate examinations and supervised training as the requirements for a professional engineering license. The length of education, and training to qualify as a basic professional engineer, is typically 8–12 years, with 15–20 years for an engineer who takes responsibility for major projects.

Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education in primary and secondary schools often serves as the foundation for engineering education at the university level.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Iverson &amp; Kalyandurg, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], engineering education is a part of the [[STEM fields|STEM initiative]] in public schools. [[Service-learning in engineering education]] is gaining popularity within the variety of disciplinary focuses within engineering education including [[chemical engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[industrial engineering]], [[computer engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], and other engineering education.

==Africa==University of Port Harcourt (uniport) River State Nigeria:
===Kenya===
Engineering training in [[Kenya]] is typically provided by the universities. Registration of engineers is governed by the Engineers Registration Act. A candidate stands to qualify as a registered engineer, R.Eng, if he/she is a holder of a minimum four years post-secondary Engineering Education and a minimum of three years of postgraduate work experience.&lt;ref&gt;Engineers Registration Board of Kenya. [http://www.erbk.go.ke/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=27 Registration of Engineers in Kenya] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816025957/http://www.erbk.go.ke/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=27 |date=16 August 2010 }}, Engineers Registration Board of Kenya website.&lt;/ref&gt;

All registrations are undertaken by the Engineers Registration Board which is a statutory body established through an Act of the Kenyan Parliament in 1969. A minor revision was done in 1992 to accommodate Technician Engineer grade. The Board has been given the responsibility of regulating the activities and conduct of Practicing Engineers in the Republic of Kenya in accordance with the functions and powers conferred upon it by the Act. Under CAP 530 of the Laws of Kenya, it is illegal for an engineer to practice or call himself an engineer if not registered with the Board. Registration with the Board is thus a license to practice engineering in Kenya.

===South Africa===
Engineering training in South Africa is typically provided by the universities, universities of technology and colleges for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (previously Further Education and Training).&lt;ref&gt;Engineering Council Of South Africa. [http://www.ecsa.co.za/index.asp?x=procedure Registration Process], Engineering Council Of South Africa website, Bruma, Johannesburg, South Africa, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The qualifications provided by these institutions must have an [[Engineering Council of South Africa]] (ECSA) accreditation for the qualification for graduates and diplomats of these institutions to be registered as Candidate Certificated Engineers,Candidate Engineers, Candidate Engineering Technologists and Candidate Engineering Technicians.

The academic training performed by the universities is typically in the form of a four-year BSc(Eng), BIng or BEng degree. For the degree to be accredited, the course material must conform to the ECSA Exit Level Outcomes (ELO).

Professional Engineers (Pr Eng) are persons that are accredited by ECSA as engineering professionals. Legally, a Professional Engineer's sign off is required for any major project to be implemented, in order to ensure the safety and standards of the project. Professional Engineering Technologists (Pr Tech Eng) and Professional Engineering Technicians (Pr Techni Eng) are other members of the engineering team.

Professional Certificated Engineers (Pr Cert Eng) are people who hold one of seven Government Certificates of Competency and who have been registered by ECSA as engineering professionals.

The categories of professionals are differentiated by the degree of complexity of work carried out, where Professional Engineers are expected to solve complex engineering problems, Professional Engineering Technologists and Professional Certificated Engineers, broadly defined engineering problems and Professional Engineering Technicians, well-defined engineering problems.

===Tanzania===
Engineering training in Tanzania is typically provided by various universities and technical institutions in the country. Graduate engineers are registered by the Engineers Registration Board (ERB) after undergoing three years of practical training. A candidate stands to qualify as a professional engineer, P.Eng, if he/she is a holder of a minimum four years post-secondary Engineering Education and a minimum of three years of postgraduate work experience. Engineers Registration Board is a statutory body established through an Act of the Tanzanian Parliament in 1968. Minor revision was done in 1997 to address the issue of engineering professional excellence in the country.

The Board has been given the responsibility of regulating the activities and conduct of Practicing Engineers in the United Republic of Tanzania in accordance with the functions and powers conferred upon it by the Act. According to Tanzania Laws, it is illegal for an engineer to practice or call himself an engineer if not registered with the Board. Registration with the Board is thus a license to practice engineering in United Republic of Tanzania.

===Malaysia===
Activities on engineering education in Malaysia are spearheaded by the Society of Engineering Education Malaysia (SEEM). SEEM was established in 2007 and launched on 23 February 2009. The idea of establishing the Society of Engineering Education was initiated on April, 2005 with the creating of a Pro-team Committee for SEEM. The objectives of this society are to contribute to the development of education in the fields of engineering education and science and technology, including teaching and learning, counseling, research, service and public relations.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, engineering education is accredited by the [[Pakistan Engineering Council]], a statutory body, constituted under the PEC Act No. V of 1976 of the constitution of Pakistan and amended vide Ordinance No.XXIII of 2006, to regulate the engineering profession in the country. It aims to achieve rapid and sustainable growth in all national, economic and social fields. The council is responsible for maintaining realistic and internationally relevant standards of professional competence and ethics for engineers in the country. PEC interacts with the Government, both at the Federal and Provincial level by participating in Commissions, Committees and Advisory Bodies. PEC is a fully representative body of the engineering community in the country. PEC has a full signatory status with [[Washington Accord]].

===Austria===
In [[Austria]], similar to Germany, an engineering degree can be obtained from either Universities or Fachhochschulen (Universities of Applied Sciences). As in most of Europe, the education usually consists of a 3-year [[Bachelor's Degree]] and a 2-year [[Master's Degree]].

A lower engineering degree is offered by [[Höhere Technische Lehranstalt|Höheren Technische Lehranstalten]], (HTL, Higher Technical Institute), a form of secondary college which reaches from grade 9 to 13. There are disciplines like [[civil engineering]], [[electronics]], [[information technology]], etc.

In the 5th year of HTL, as in other secondary schools in Austria, there is a final exam, called [[Matura]]. Graduates obtain an ''Ingenieur'' engineering degree after three years of work in the studied field.

===Bulgaria===
The beginning of higher engineering education in [[Bulgaria]] is established by the Law for Establishing a Higher Technical School in Sofia in 1941. Only two years later however because of the bombs flying over [[Sofia]], the school was evacuated in [[Lovech]], and the regular classes were discontinued. The learning process started again in 1945 when the University became a State Polytechnic.

In [[Bulgaria]], engineers are trained in the three basic degrees - bachelor, master and doctor. Since the [[Bologna declaration]], students receive a bachelor's degree (4 years of studies), optionally followed by a [[master's degree]] (1 years of studies). The science and engineering courses include lecture and laboratory education. The main subjects to be studied are mathematics, physics, chemistry, electrical engineering and etc. The degree received after completing with a state exam or defense of a thesis. Absolvents are awarded with the ''Ing''. title always put in front of one's name.

Some of [[engineering]] specialties are completely traditional, such as machine building, computer and software engineering, automation, electrical engineering, electronics. Newer specialties are [[engineering design]], mechatronics, [[aviation engineering]], industrial engineering.

The following technical universities prepare mainly engineers in Bulgaria:

* Technical University Sofia
* Technical University Varna
* Technical University Gabrovo&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tugab.bg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=featured&amp;Itemid=298&amp;lang=en Technical University Gabrovo]&lt;/ref&gt;
* University of Forestry
* University of Architecture, Civil Engineering and Geodesy
* University of Chemical Technology and Metallurgy Sofia
* Agricultural University Plovdiv
* University of Mining and Geology “St. Ivan Rilski”

The Bulgarian engineers are united in the Federation of Scientific and Technical Unions, established in 1949. It comprises 33 territorial and 19 national unions.

===Denmark===
In Denmark, the engineering degree is delivered by either Universities or Engineering Colleges (e.g. Engineering College of Aarhus).

Students receive first a baccalaureate degree (3 years of studies) followed by a master's degree (1–2 years of studies) according to the principles of the Bologna declaration, though traditionally. The engineering doctorate degree is the ''[[PhD]]'' (3 years of studies).

The quality of Danish engineering expertise has long been much vaunted. Danish engineers especially from Engineering Colleges have also been praised at being very practical (i.e. skilled at physical work related to their discipline), ascribed to the high quality of the apprenticeship courses many Danish engineers go through as part of their education.

===Finland===
Finland's system is derived from Germany's system. Two kinds of universities are recognized, the universities and the universities of applied sciences [Ammattikorkeakoulu].

Universities award typically 'Bachelor of Science in Technology' and 'Master of Science in Technology' degrees. Bachelor's degree is a three-year degree as master's degree is equivalent for two-year full-time studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aalto.fi/en/studies/about_studying_at_aalto/ |title=Aalto University studies-pages |accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Finnish the master's degree is called [[diplomi-insinööri]], similarly as in Germany (''Diplom-Ingenieur''). The degrees are awarded by engineering schools or faculties in universities (in [[Aalto University]], [[University of Oulu|Oulu]], [[University of Turku|Turku]], [[University of Vaasa|Vaasa]] and [[Åbo Akademi University]]) or by separate universities of technology ([[Tampere university of technology|Tampere UT]] and [[Lappeenranta University of Technology|Lappeenranta UT]]). The degree is a scientific, theoretical taught master's degree. Master's thesis is important part of master's degree studies. Master's degree qualifies for further study into Licentiate or Doctorate. Because of the Bologna process, the degree ''tekniikan kandidaatti'' ("Bachelor of Technology"), corresponding to three years of study into the master's degree, has been introduced.

The Universities of applied sciences are regional universities that award 3.5-, to 4-year engineer degrees [[insinööri (amk)]]. An engineer's degree is noramlly 240 ECTS. There are 20 universities of applied sciences in Finland with a vide range of disciplines. The aim of the degree is professional competency with an emphasis on practical problem solving in engineering. Normally the teaching language is Finnish but there are also universities with Swedish as language of instruction, and most universities of applied sciences offer some degrees in English, too. These universities also award a  Master of Engineering degree, designed for engineers already involved in the working life with at least two years of professional experience.

===France===
In France, the engineering degree is mainly delivered by "[[Grande École#List of graduate engineering schools (grandes écoles d'ingénieurs)|Grandes Écoles d'Ingénieurs]]" (graduate schools of engineering) upon completion of 3 years of Master's studies. Many Écoles recruit undergraduate students from [[Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles|CPGE]] (two- or three-year high level program after the [[Baccalauréat]]), even though some of them include an integrated undergraduate cycle. Other students accessing these Grandes Ecoles may come from other horizons, such as DUT or BTS (technical two-year university degrees) or standard two-year university degrees. In all cases, recruitment is highly selective. Hence graduate engineers in France have studied a minimum of five years after the baccalaureate. Since 2013, the French engineering degree is recognized by the [[American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers|AACRAO]] as a Master of Science in Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://highereducation.frenchculture.org/news/accord-historique-pour-les-ingenieurs-francais-aux-etats-unis|title=Accord historique pour les ingénieurs français aux Etats-Unis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To be able to deliver the engineering degree, an École Master 's curriculum has to be validated by the [[Commission des titres d'ingénieur]] ([[Commission des titres d'ingénieur|Commission of the Engineering Title]]). It is important for the external observer to note that the system in France is extremely demanding in its entrance requirements (numerus clausus, using student rank in exams as the only criterion), despite being almost free of tuition fees, and much stricter in regards to the academic level of applying students than many other systems. The system focuses solely on selecting students by their engineering fundamental disciplines (mathematics, physics) abilities rather than their financial ability to finance large tuition fees, thus enabling a wider population access to higher education. In fact, being a graduate engineer in France is considered as being near/at the top of the social/professional ladder. The engineering profession grew from the military and the nobility in the 18th century. Before the [[French Revolution]], engineers were trained in schools for technical officers, like "École d'Arts et Métiers" ([[Arts et Métiers ParisTech]]) established in 1780. Then, other schools were created, for instance the [[École Polytechnique]] and the [[Conservatoire national des arts et métiers]] which was established in 1794. Polytechnique is one of the ''grandes écoles'' that have traditionally prepared technocrats to lead French government and industry, and has been one of the most privileged routes into the elite divisions of the civil service known as the [[French Civil Service#Great corps of the State|"grands corps de l'État"]].

Inside a French company the title of ''Ingénieur'' refers to a rank in qualification and is not restricted. Therefore, there are sometimes ''Ingénieurs des Ventes'' (Sales Engineers), ''Ingénieur Marketing'', ''Ingénieur Bancaire'' (Banking Engineer), ''Ingénieur Recherche &amp; Développement'' (R&amp;D Engineer), etc.

===Germany===
In [[Germany]], the term ''Ingenieur'' (engineer) is legally protected and may only be used by graduates of a university degree program in engineering. Such degrees are offered by universities (''Universitäten''), including ''Technische Universitäten'' (universities of technology), or [[Fachhochschule|''Fachhochschulen'']] (universities of applied sciences), including ''[[Technische Hochschule]]n''.

Since the [[Bologna Process|Bologna reforms]], students receive a bachelor's degree (3–4 years of studies), optionally followed by a master's degree (1–2 years of studies). Prior to the country adopting the Bologna system, the first and only pre-doctorate degree received after completing engineering education at university was the German ''[[Diplom]]ingenieur'' (Dipl.-Ing.). The engineering [[doctorate]] is the ''[[Doktoringenieur]]'' (Dr.-Ing.).

The quality of German engineering expertise has long been much vaunted, especially in the field of mechanical engineering. This is supported by the degree to which the various theories governing [[aerodynamics]] and [[structural mechanics]] are named after German scientists and engineers such as [[Ludwig Prandtl]]. German engineers have also been praised at being very practical (i.e. skilled at physical work related to their discipline), ascribed to the high quality of the apprenticeship courses many German engineers go through as part of their education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dF7G0yZ51GgC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41 Human Resource Management] - Biswajeet Pattanayak, 3rd Edition, Page 41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
In [[Italy]], the engineering degree and "engineer" title is delivered by Polytechnic Universities upon completion of 3 years of studies (laurea). Additional master's degree (2 years) and doctorate programs (3 years) provide the title of "dottore di ricerca in ingegneria". Students that started studies in Polytechnic Universities before 2005 (when Italy adopted the Bologna declaration) need to complete a 5 years program to get the engineer title. In this case the master's degree is obtained after 1 year of studies.
Only people with an engineer title can be employed as "engineers". Still, some with competence and experience in an engineering field that do not have such a title, can still be employed to perform engineering tasks as "specialist", "assistant", "technologist" or "technician". But, only engineers can take legal responsibility and provide guarantee upon the work done by a team in their area of expertise. Sometimes a company working in this area, which temporarily does not have any employees with an engineer title must pay for an external service of an engineering audit to provide legal guarantee for their products or services.

===The Netherlands===
In the [[Netherlands]] there are two ways to study engineering, i.e. at the Dutch 'technical [[hogeschool]]', which is a [[professional school]] (equivalent to a [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|polytechnic]] in the UK and a [[university of applied sciences]] internationally) and awards a practically orientated degree with the pre-nominal ''ing.'' after four years study. Or at the university, which offers a more academically oriented degree with the pre-nominal ''ir.'' after five years study. Both are abbreviations of the title [[Ingenieur]].

In 2002 when the [[Netherlands]] switched to the Bachelor-Master system. This is a consequence of the [[Bologna process]]. In this accord 29 European countries agreed to harmonize their higher education system and create a [[European higher education area]]. In this system the professional schools award bachelor's degrees like ''BEng'' or ''BASc'' after four years study. And the universities with engineering programs award the bachelor's degree ''BSc'' after the third year. A university bachelor is usually continuing his education for one or two more years to earn his master's degree ''MSc''. Adjacent to these degrees, the old titles of the pre-populated system are still in use. A ''vocational'' bachelor may be admitted to a university master's degree program although often they are required to take additional courses.

===Poland===
In [[Poland]] after 3,5–4 years of technical studies, one gets '''inżynier''' degree ('''inż.'''), which corresponds to ''B.Sc.'' or ''B.Eng.'' After that, one can continue studies, and after 2 years of post-graduate programme (supplementary studies) can obtain additional ''M.Sc.'' (or ''M.Eng.'') degree, called '''magister''', '''mgr''', and that time one has two degrees: '''magister inżynier''', '''mgr inż.''' (literally: ''master engineer''). The ''mgr'' degree formerly (until full adaptation of [[Bologna process]] by university) could be obtained in integrated 5 years B.Sc-M.Sc. programme studies. Graduates having ''magister inżynier'' degree, can start 4 years doctorate studies (Ph.D.), which require opening of doctoral proceedings (''przewód doktorski''), carrying out own research, passing some exams (''e.g.'' foreign language, philosophy, economy, leading subjects), writing and defense of doctoral thesis. Some Ph.D. students have also classes with undergraduate students (B.Sc., M.Sc.). Graduate of doctorate studies of technical university holds ''scientific degree'' of '''doktor nauk technicznych''', '''dr inż.''', (literally: ''"doctor of technical sciences"'') or other ''e.g.'' ''Doktor Nauk Chemicznych'' (lit. ''"doctor of chemical sciences"'').

===Portugal===
In Portugal, there are two paths to study engineering: the [[polytechnic (Portugal)|polytechnic]] and the university paths. In theory, but many times not so much in practice, the polytechnic path is more practical oriented, the university path being more research oriented.
 
In this system, the polytechnic institutes award a ''licenciatura'' (bachelor) in engineering degree after three years of study, that can be complemented by a ''mestrado'' (master) in engineering after two plus years of study.

Regarding the universities, they offer both engineering programs similar to those of the polytechnics (three years ''licenciatura'' plus two years ''mestrado'') as ''mestrado integrados'' (integrated master's) in engineering programs. The ''mestrado integrado'' programs take five years of study to complete, awarding a ''licenciatura'' degree in engineering sciences after the first three years and a ''mestrado'' degree in engineering after the whole five years. Further, the universities also offer ''doutoramento'' (Ph.D.) programs in engineering.

Being an holder of an academic degree in engineering is not enough to practice the profession of engineer and to have the legal right of the use of the title ''engenheiro'' (engineer) in Portugal. For that, it is necessary to be admitted and be a member of the [[Ordem dos Engenheiros]] (Portuguese institution of engineers). At the Ordem dos Engenheiros, an engineer is classified as an E1, E2 or E3 grade engineer, accordingly with the higher engineer degree he or she holds. Holders of the ancient pre-Bologna declaration five years ''licenciatura'' degrees in engineering are classified as E2 engineers.

===Romania===
In [[Romania]], the engineering degree and "engineer" title is delivered by technology and polytechnics universities upon completion of 4 years of studies. Additional master's degree (2 years) and doctorate programs (4–5 years) provide the title of "doctor inginer". Students that started studies in Polytechnic Universities before 2005 (when Romania adopted the Bologna declaration) needed to complete a 5 years program to get the engineer title. In this case the master's degree is obtained after 1 year of studies.
Only people with an engineer title can be employed as "engineers". Still, some with competence and experience in an engineering field that do not have such a title, can still be employed to perform engineering tasks as "specialist", "assistant", "technologist" or "technician". But, only engineers can take legal responsibility and provide guarantee upon the work done by a team in their area of expertise. Sometimes a company working in this area, which temporarily does not have any employees with an engineer title must pay for an external service of an engineering audit to provide legal guarantee for their products or services.

[[Moscow School of Mathematics and Navigation]] was a first Russian educational institution founded by [[Peter the Great]] in 1701. It provided Russians with technical education for the first time and much of its curriculum was devoted to producing sailors, engineers, cartographers and bombardiers to support Russian expanding navy and army.
Then in 1810, the Saint Petersburg [[Military engineering-technical university]] becomes the first engineering [[higher learning institution]] in the [[Russian Empire]], after addition of officers classes and application of five-year term of teaching. So initially more rigorisms of standards and teaching terms became the traditional historical feature of the Russian engineering education in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://works.tarefer.ru/33/101252/index.html|title=Реферат История Подготовка инженеров России в XIX веке|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slovakia===
In [[Slovakia]], an engineer (''inžinier'') is considered to be a person holding master's degree in technical sciences or economics. Several technical and economic universities offer 4-5-year master study in the fields of chemistry, agriculture, material technology, computer science, electrical and mechanical engineering, nuclear physics and technology or economics. A bachelor's degree in similar field is prerequisite. Absolvents are awarded with the ''Ing.'' title always put in front of one's name; eventual follow-up doctoral study is offered both by universities and some institutes of the [[Slovak Academy of Sciences]].

===Spain===
In [[Spain]], the engineering degree is delivered by Universities in Engineering Schools, called "Escuelas de Ingeniería". Like with any other degree in Spain, students need to pass a series of examinations based on Bachillerato's subjects (Selectividad), select their bachelor's degree, and their marks determine whether they are access the degree they want or not.

Students receive first a grado degree (4 years of studies) followed by a master's degree (1–2 years of studies) according to the principles of the Bologna declaration, though traditionally, the degree received after completing an engineering education is the Spanish title of "Ingeniero". Using the title "Ingeniero" is legally regulated and limited to the according academic graduates.

===Sweden===
An institution offering engineering education is called "teknisk [[högskola]]" (institute of technology). These schools primarily offers five-year programmes resulting in the ''civilingenjör'' degree (not to be confused with the narrower English term "civil engineer"), internationally corresponding to a [[Master of Science in Engineering]] degree. These programmes typically offers a strong backing in the natural sciences, and the degree also opens up for doctoral (PHD) studies towards the degree "teknologie doktor". Civilingenjör programmes are offered in a broad range of fields: [[Engineering physics]], [[Chemical engineering|Chemistry]], [[Civil engineering]], [[surveying]], Industrial engineering and management, etc. There also are shorter three-year programmes called ''högskoleingenjör'' ([[Bachelor of Science in Engineering]]) that are typically more applied.

===Turkey===
In [[Turkey]], engineering degrees range from a bachelor's degree in engineering (for a four-year period), to a master's degree (adding two years), and to a doctoral degree (usually four to five years).

The title is limited by law to people with an engineering degree, and the use of the title by others (even persons with much more work experience) is illegal.

The Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects (UCTEA) was established in 1954 and separates engineers and architects to professional branches, with the condition of being within the framework of laws and regulations and in accordance with the present conditions, requirements and possibilities and to also establishes new Chambers for the group of engineers and architects, whose professional or working areas are similar or the same.

UCTEA is maintaining its activities with its 23 Chambers, 194 branches of its Chambers and 39 Provincial Coordination Councils. Approximately, graduates of 70 related academic disciplines in engineering, architecture and city planning are members of the Chambers of UCTEA.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, like in the United States and [[Canada]], most professional engineers are trained in universities, but some can start in a technical [[apprenticeship]] and either enroll in a university engineering degree later, or enroll in one of the [[Engineering Council UK]] programmes (level 6 - bachelor's and 7 - master's) administered by the [[City and Guilds of London Institute]]. A recent trend has seen the rise of both bachelor's and master's degree higher engineering apprenticeships. All accredited engineering courses and apprenticeships are assessed and approved by the various professional engineering institutions reflecting the subject by engineering discipline covered; [[IMechE]], [[Institution of Engineering and Technology|IET]], [[British Computer Society|BCS]], [[Institution of Civil Engineers|ICE]], [[Institution of Structural Engineers|IStructE]] etc. Many of these institutions date back to the 19th century, and have previously administered their own engineering examination programmes. They have become globally renowned as premier learned societies.

The degree then counts in part to qualifying as a [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|Chartered Engineer]] after a period (usually 4–8 years beyond the first degree) of structured professional practice, professional practice peer review and, if required, further exams to then become a corporate member of the relevant professional body. The term 'Chartered Engineer' is regulated by [[Royal Assent]] and its use is restricted only to those registered; the awarding of this status is devolved to the professional institutions by the Engineering Council.

In the UK, most engineering courses take three years for an undergraduate bachelors ([[BEng]]) and four years for an [[Master's degree in Europe#United Kingdom|undergraduate master's]]. Students who read a four-year engineering course are awarded a [[MEng|Masters of Engineering]] (as opposed to [[Master of Science in Engineering|Masters of Science in Engineering]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.see.ed.ac.uk/undergraduate/Prospective/mech/DegsAvail/mech_eng.shtml "Prospective"], [[University of Edinburgh]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some universities allow a student to opt out after one year before completion of the programme and receive a [[Higher National Diploma]] if a student has successfully completed the second year, or a [[Higher National Certificate]] if only successfully completed year one. Many courses also include an option of a year in industry, which is usually a year before completion. Students who opt for this are awarded a 'sandwich' degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seacoast.sunderland.ac.uk/~hs0acu/Biomed/sandwich.htm "Sandwich degree"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726093951/http://seacoast.sunderland.ac.uk/~hs0acu/Biomed/sandwich.htm |date=26 July 2010 }}, University of Sunderland&lt;/ref&gt;

BEng graduates may be registered as an "[[Incorporated Engineer]]" by the Engineering Council after a period of structured professional practice, professional practice peer review and, if required, further exams to then become a member of the relevant professional body. Again, the term 'Incorporated Engineer' is regulated by Royal Assent and its use is restricted only to those registered; the awarding of this status is devolved to the professional institutions by the Engineering Council.

Unlike the US and Canada, engineers do not require a licence to practice the profession in the UK. In the UK, the term "engineer" is applied to non-degree vocations such as [[Engineering technologist|technologist]]s, [[technicians]], [[draftsmen]], [[machinists]], [[mechanic]]s, [[plumbers]], [[electricians]], repair people, semi-skilled and even unskilled occupations.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

In recent developments by government and industry, to addressing the growing skills deficit in many fields of UK engineering, there has been a strong emphasis placed on dealing with engineering in school and providing students with positive role models from a young age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/policy/the-need-for-role-models-in-british-engineering |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113014113/http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/policy/the-need-for-role-models-in-british-engineering |archive-date=13 January 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America==
===Canada===
Engineering degree education in Canada is highly regulated by the [[Canadian Council of Professional Engineers]] (Engineers Canada) and its Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB). In [[Canada]], there are 43 institutions offering 278 engineering accredited programs delivering a bachelor's degree after a term of 4 years.&lt;ref name="Engineers Canada Accreditation page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Engineers Canada Accreditation|url=http://www.engineerscanada.ca/accreditation|website=engineerscanada.ca|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many schools also offer graduate level degrees in the applied sciences. ''Accreditation'' means that students who successfully complete the accredited program will have received sufficient engineering knowledge in order to meet the knowledge requirements of licensure as a [[Professional Engineer]].&lt;ref name="Engineers Canada Accreditation page" /&gt; Alternately, Canadian graduates of unaccredited 3-year diploma, BSc, B.Tech, or B.Eng programs can qualify for professional license by association examinations. Some of the schools include: [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]], [[École de technologie supérieure]], [[École Polytechnique de Montréal]], [[University of Toronto]], [[University of Manitoba]], [[University of Saskatchewan]], [[University of Victoria]], [[University of Calgary]], [[University of Alberta]], [[University of British Columbia]], [[McGill University]], [[Dalhousie University]], [[Ryerson University]], [[York University]], [[University of Regina]], [[Carleton University]], [[McMaster University]], [[University of Ottawa]], [[Queen's University]], [[University of New Brunswick]], [[UOIT]], [[University of Waterloo]], [[University of Guelph]], [[University of Windsor]], [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]], and [[Royal Military College of Canada]] just to name a few. Every university offering engineering degrees in Canada needs to be accredited by the CEAB (Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board), thus ensuring high standards are enforced at all universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineerscanada.ca/e/co_schools.cfm Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board Approved Schools] Retrieved on 13 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Engineering degrees in Canada are distinct from degrees in [[engineering technology]] which are more applied degrees or diplomas. An engineering education in Canada is held in very high esteem culminating by qualifying as a [[professional engineer]] (P.Eng) licensee. Many graduate engineers enter other areas of professional practice including management consulting, law, medicine, and business administration.

=== Mexico ===
{{Confusing section|date=January 2017}}
In the case of Mexico, the education in Engineering field could be taken from public and private Universities. Both types of Colleges and Universities can confers degrees of B.Eng., B.Sc., M.Eng., M.Sc. and Ph.D. through the presentation and dissertation of a thesis or other kind of requirements such as Technical reports, knowledge exams among others.

The first University on Mexico in offers degrees in some Engineering fields was the Pontifical and royal University of Mexico, established under the Spanish rule; the degrees offered by includes Mines Engineering and Physical Mathematical state of the art knowledge from Europe.

Entered the 19th century and lack of political stability the Universities founded under Spanish rule were closed and reopened and the Engineering teaching tradition was lost; the University of Mexico, University of Guadalajara and University of Mérida suffered this. then the liberal rule create the Arts and Handcraft schools were opened without the same success as the Universities. Entered on 20th Century and with the success of Mexican Revolution some of that old colleges were reopened and the old Arts and Handcraft schools were joined to the new Universities. On 1936 the National Polytechnic Institute of Mexico was created as an educational alternative for workers son and it's families, few time later the Regional Institutes of Technology were founded as a branch of the Polytechnic Institute on few states of the republic, the most of them do not have any University in own territory.

Right now the Regional Institutes of Technology were merged into one single entity labeled as "Mexican National Technological Institute". The National Polytechnic Institute is the ensign university of the Mexican federal government on engineering education.

Some of the first engineers designed irrigation canals, buildings, dams, and many other things to satisfy the needs of the people. Early engineers during wartime designed weapons and war machines. Engineering education has changed since the times of the early engineers. "By the middle of the 20th century there were almost 1 million engineers in the United States."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Reyes-Guerra, D. R. (2011). Engineering. In J. M. Castagno, P. Barrows, L. Brearley, &amp; K. Fairchild (Eds.), Grolier online. Retrieved from http://0-ea.grolier.com.libweb.dmacc.edu/article?id=0143510-00{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first professional degree in engineering is a bachelor's degree with few exceptions. This being said, interest in engineering has grown since 1999; the number of bachelor's degrees issued has increased by 20%.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Most bachelor's degree engineering programs are four years long and require about two years of [[Core curriculum|core courses]] followed by two years of specialized discipline specific courses. This is where a typical engineering student would learn [[mathematics]] (single- and multi-variable [[calculus]] and elementary [[differential equation]]s), general [[chemistry]], [[English composition]], general and modern [[physics]], [[computer science]] (typically [[Computer programming|programming]]), and introductory engineering in several areas that are required for a satisfactory engineering background and to be successful in their program of choice. Several courses in [[social science]]s or [[humanities]] are often also required to be taken, but are commonly [[elective course]]s from a broad choice. Required common engineering courses typically include [[engineering drawing]]/drafting, [[materials engineering]], [[statics]] and [[Dynamics (physics)|dynamics]], [[strength of materials]], electrical engineering, [[thermodynamics]], [[fluid mechanics]], and perhaps some [[Systems engineering|systems]] or industrial engineering. The science and engineering courses include lecture and laboratory education, either in the same course(s) or in separate courses. However, some professors and educators believe that engineering programs should change to focus more on professional engineering practice, and engineering courses should be taught more by professional engineering practitioners and not by engineering researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Wulf, W. A., Smith, R., Winston, S. B., Lotas, A., Marcum, K., Beale, K., Sherman, W. (2007, 23 February). Engineering education in the 21st century [Video file]. Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oaIhzlpENY&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the first year an engineering student should be looking to decide what specialization they would like to study. Specializations could include the following: civil (including [[Structural engineering|structural]]), [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]], electrical (often including [[computer engineering|computers]]), [[Chemical engineering|chemical]], [[Biological engineering|biological]], [[Industrial engineering|industrial]], [[Aerospace engineering|aerospace]], [[Materials engineering|materials]] (including [[Metallurgical engineering|metallurgical]]), [[Agricultural engineering|agricultural]], and many other specializations. After choosing a specialization an engineering student will begin to take class that will build on the education that they have received and focus their future education toward their specialization or field of study. Towards the end of their undergraduate education, engineering students often undertake a [[design]] or other special project specific to their field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learnon.org/ |title=Educating Engineers |accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After formal education, the engineer will often enter an [[internship]] or [[engineer in training]] status for approximately four years. After that time the [[engineer in training]] can decide whether or not to take a state licensing test to make them a [[Professional Engineer]]. After successful completion of that test, the Professional engineer can place the initials P.E. after their name signifying that they are now a Professional Engineer.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
There are also [[graduate degree]] options for an engineer. Many engineers decide to complete a master's degree in some field of engineering or [[Masters in Business Administration|business administration]] or get education in law, medicine, or other field.

Two types of doctorate are available also, the traditional [[Ph.D.]] or the [[doctor of engineering]]. The Ph.D. focuses on research and academic excellence, whereas the doctor of engineering focuses on practical engineering. The education requirements are the same for both degrees; however, the [[dissertation]] required is different. The Ph.D. requires the standard research problem, where the doctor of engineering focuses on a practical dissertation.

In present undergraduate engineering education, the emphasis on linear systems develops a way of thinking that dismisses nonlinear dynamics as spurious oscillations. The linear systems approach oversimplifies the dynamics of nonlinear systems. Hence, the undergraduate students and teachers should recognize the educational value of [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title= Introducing undergraduate electrical engineering students to chaotic dynamics: Computer simulations with logistic map and buck converter.|last= Iqbal|first= Sajid| year= 2014| doi= 10.1109/AMS.2014.20|pages = 47–52|publisher= Modelling Symposium (AMS), 2014 8th Asia.

After graduation, [[continuing education]] courses may be needed to keep a government-issued [[professional engineer]] (PE) license valid, to keep skills fresh, to expand skills, or to keep up with new technology.

== South America ==
=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, education in engineering is offered by both public and private institutions. A degree in engineering requires 5 to 6 years of studies, comprising the core courses, specific subjects, an internship and a ''Course Completion Paper''.

Due to the nature of college admissions in Brazil, most students have to declare their major before entering college. This said, the first 2 years of a degree in engineering consist mostly of the core courses (calculus, physics, programming, etc.) along with a few specific subjects as well as some courses in humanities. After this period, some institutions offer specializations within the different fields of engineering (i.e. a student majoring in electrical engineering can choose to specialize in electronics or telecommunications) although most institutions balance their workload in order to give the students a consistent knowledge of every specialiation.

Towards the end of their undergratuate education, students are required to develop the Course Completion Paper under the guidance of an adviser to be presented to and graded by a number of professors. In some institutions, studends are also required to pursue an internship (the amount of time depends on the institution).

In order to pursue a career in engineering, graduates must first register with and abide by the rules of the Regional Counsel of Engineering and Agronomy of their state, a regional representative of the Federal Counsel of Engineering and Agronomy, a certification board for engineers, agronomists, geologists and other professionals of the applied sciences.

The '''Five Colleges of Ohio''' is an academic and administrative consortium of five selective private [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]] in the US state of [[Ohio]]. It is a nonprofit educational consortium established in 1995 to promote the broad educational and cultural objectives of its member institutions. The consortium developed from a range of highly successful collaborations including friendly academic and athletic rivalries among the five institutions.

==Members==
The members of The Five Colleges of Ohio consortium are:
* [[Denison University]], [[Granville, Ohio]]
* [[Kenyon College]], [[Gambier, Ohio]]
* [[Oberlin College]], [[Oberlin, Ohio]]
* [[Ohio Wesleyan University]], [[Delaware, Ohio]]
* [[The College of Wooster]], [[Wooster, Ohio]]

== History ==
The designation ''Ohio Five'' first appeared in Ohio newspapers in the early twentieth century. The grouping, predating any formal agreement, was immediately adopted by the press as a foreshadowing of an Ohio league of schools with similar academic and athletic reputations, which, at the time was a common perception.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Following informal discussions among the five colleges in the early 1990s, the consortium was formalized by the incorporation of the organization on June 30, 1995. The five colleges had been affiliated as members of state and national educational and athletic organizations and had enjoyed friendly rivalry in various academic and athletic competitions, similar to [[Little Three]] in New England. 

A grant from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], awarded in June 1995, provided for the development of a joint library system, establishment of an administrative structure, and investigation of the benefits and methods for sharing digital images and multimedia resources, establishing The Five Colleges of Ohio, Inc. as a legal entity.

== Collaboration ==

Collaboration among the five colleges occurs in several areas:

*Academic Programs
*[[Academic administration|Administrative]] Programs
*Libraries
*Technology
*Cross-registration
*[[Sport|Athletic]] Rivalry

== Academic programs ==
The five colleges collaborate on various academic projects. During 2004 and 2005 collaboration has been active in language videoconferencing in languages that are less commonly taught. The five colleges collaborate in the instruction of [[Arabic language]] courses and significant applications of teaching technology in joint teaching enterprises.

A recent project, began in May 2006, focused on how creativity and critical reasoning develop and are embedded in the liberal arts curriculum of each member college. The project will provide a quantitative understanding of how student at each college define "creativity" and "critical reasoning" and how these two attributes change as a result of their academic experiences in a liberal arts college.

==Administrative programs==
The colleges currently maintain a central clearing house for employment opportunities at all five schools.

==Libraries==
The libraries of [[Denison University]], [[Kenyon College]], [[Ohio Wesleyan University]], and [[The College of Wooster]] share an [[integrated library system]] called [[CONSORT Colleges|CONSORT]]. The primary objective of this endeavor is to maximize the ability to share a diverse book collection and other electronic resources. [[Oberlin College]] maintains its own [[integrated library system]] called [http://obis.oberlin.edu/ OBIS].

==Technology==
The members also collaborate on various technology-related projects. For example, in order to be able to handle environmental impact cost efficiently, environmental health and safety (EHS) managers of the five schools meet into one central resource team, called the EHS Roundtable.

== Athletic rivalry ==

The five schools have been athletic rivals for almost a century. The informal athletic rivalry was formalized in 1984 when the five colleges left the [[Ohio Athletic Conference]] to form a new league, beginning with the 1984–85 academic year. A desire for greater uniformity in academic and athletic standards was cited as the major motive for the withdrawal of these schools from the OAC. [https://web.archive.org/web/20051026115112/http://www.oac.org/Ohio%20Althletic%20Conference/General%20OAC/History/OAC%20History.pdf].

It was in February, 1983 that the [[North Coast Athletic Conference]] was created to "foster a complementary relationship between intercollegiate athletics and the pursuit of academic excellence". [https://web.archive.org/web/20050310202704/http://www.northcoast.org/timeline/83_88.html]. Each league member was to have seven sports for both men and women and each school would go off campus for recruiting. It was decided that there would be no athletic scholarships.

Wooster teams are now known as the ''Fighting Scots,'' Kenyon's nickname is ''Lords and Ladies,'' Denison's teams are known as ''Big Red,'' Oberlin's teams are known as the ''Yeomen,'' and Ohio Wesleyan's nickname is the ''Battling Bishops''.

Ohio Wesleyan and Denison share a historic rivalry in [[lacrosse]], which has been very closely contested.

==Students==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:OhioFivePolitical.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Political leanings of students of Ohio Five Colleges from survey responses on [[Facebook|thefacebook]] on April 10, 2005.]] --&gt;

A majority of students at all the schools self-identify as liberal. Students at Oberlin and Wesleyan have the highest percentage of liberal students while Denison attracts the highest percentage of students who identify as conservative and very conservative. 

The curriculum at all of the five schools is highly structured and academically rigorous. Generally, the four basic elements—the required humanities sequence, the breadth of study requirement, and a senior thesis (Independent Study at Wooster, Senior Exercise at Kenyon, varying specifics based on major at the other schools) — creates a mix for strong component of interdisciplinary work with study of traditional majors.

First- and second-year students at each one of the colleges develop a strong a background in a broad context of liberal arts classes. Classes like Love and Sex at [[Ohio Wesleyan University]], Philosophy of Art at [[Kenyon College]] or the Oberlin Film Series at [[Oberlin College]] provide opportunities for humanistic and scientific study. The junior and senior years at each college provide opportunities for intensive examination of the subject matter and techniques of a more narrowly defined academic discipline. 

Other features of the student bodies at the five schools exist. Oberlin attracts the highest percent of out-of-state students, followed by Kenyon and Ohio Wesleyan. Ohio Wesleyan has the highest percent of international students among the five schools and currently has the fifth highest percentage of international students among all liberal arts colleges. Oberlin and Wooster typically have the highest percentage of students continuing for PhD degrees immediately following graduation.

[[File:Bankside power station and St George the Martyr church - geograph.org.uk - 1607688.jpg|thumb|Flue gas from London's [[Bankside Power Station]], 1975]]

'''Flue gas''' is the [[gas]] exiting to the atmosphere via a [[flue]], which is a pipe or channel for conveying exhaust gases from a fireplace, oven, [[furnace]], [[boiler]] or [[Boiler (power generation)|steam generator]]. Quite often, the flue gas refers to the [[combustion]] exhaust gas produced at [[power plants]]. Its composition depends on what is being burned, but it will usually consist of mostly [[nitrogen]] (typically more than two-thirds) derived from the combustion of air, [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}), and [[water vapor]] as well as excess [[oxygen]] (also derived from the combustion air). It further contains a small percentage of a number of pollutants, such as [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] (like [[soot]]), [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitrogen oxides]], and [[sulfur oxides]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Fossil_fuel_combustion_glue_gases?topic=74180 Fossil fuel combustion flue gases] Milton R. Beychok, Encyclopedia of Earth, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scrubbing==
At power plants, flue gas is often treated with a series of chemical processes and [[scrubber]]s, which remove pollutants. [[Electrostatic Precipitator|Electrostatic precipitators]] or [[Dust collector#Fabric filters|fabric filters]] remove particulate matter and [[flue-gas desulfurization]] captures the [[sulfur dioxide]] produced by burning fossil fuels, particularly coal. Nitrogen oxides are treated either by modifications to the combustion process to prevent their formation, or by high temperature or catalytic reaction with [[ammonia]] or [[urea]]. In either case, the aim is to produce nitrogen gas, rather than nitrogen oxides. In the United States, there is a rapid deployment of technologies to remove [[mercury (element)|mercury]] from flue gas—typically by [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] on sorbents or by capture in inert solids as part of the [[flue-gas desulfurization]] product. Such scrubbing can lead to meaningful recovery of sulfur for further industrial use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Sulfur?topic=49557 Sulfur] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028080550/http://www.eoearth.org/article/Sulfur?topic=49557 |date=October 28, 2012 }} C. Michael Hogan, Encyclopedia of Earth, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Technologies based on regenerative capture by [[amines]] for the removal of {{CO2}} from flue gas have been deployed to provide high purity {{CO2}} gas to the food industry, and for [[enhanced oil recovery]]. They are now under active research as a method for {{CO2}} capture for long-term storage as a means of [[greenhouse gas remediation]], and have begun to be implemented in a limited way commercially (e.g. the [[Sleipner gas field#Carbon capture and storage project|Sleipner West field]] in the [[North Sea]], operating since 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statoil.com/en/TechnologyInnovation/ProtectingTheEnvironment/CarboncaptureAndStorage/Pages/CarbonDioxideInjectionSleipnerVest.aspx|title=Technology - Technology and innovation - statoil.com|website=www.statoil.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216072031/http://www.statoil.com/en/TechnologyInnovation/ProtectingTheEnvironment/CarboncaptureAndStorage/Pages/CarbonDioxideInjectionSleipnerVest.aspx|archivedate=2009-12-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of proven technologies for removing pollutants emitted from power plants that are now available. There is also much ongoing research into technologies that will remove even more air pollutants.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

'''Forensic statistics''' is the application of [[Statistical model|probability models]] and [[Statistics|statistical techniques]] to scientific evidence, such as [[DNA profiling|DNA evidence]],&lt;ref name="Gill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~gill/forensic.statistics.pdf|title=Forensic Statistics: Ready for Consumption?|first=Richard|last=Gill|publisher=Mathematical Institute, Leiden University}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the law. In contrast to "everyday" statistics, to not engender bias or unduly draw conclusions, forensic statisticians report likelihoods as [[Likelihood function|likelihood ratios]] (LR). This ratio of probabilities is then used by [[jury|juries]] or [[judge]]s to draw inferences or conclusions and decide legal matters.&lt;ref name="Gill"/&gt; Jurors and judges rely on the strength of a DNA match, given by statistics, to make conclusions and determine guilt or innocence in legal matters.&lt;ref name="Perlin"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Perlin |first1=Mark |title=Inclusion probability for DNA mixtures is a subjective one-sided match statistic unrelated to identification information |journal=Journal of Pathology Informatics |date=2015 |volume=6 |issue=59 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4639950/ |accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In forensic science, the DNA evidence received for [[DNA profiling]] often contains a mixture of more than one person’s DNA. DNA profiles are generated using a set procedure, however, the interpretation of a DNA profile becomes more complicated when the sample contains a mixture of DNA. Regardless of the number of contributors to the forensic sample, statistics and probabilities must be used to provide weight to the evidence and to describe what the results of the DNA evidence mean. In a single-source DNA profile, the statistic used is termed a random match probability (RMP). RMPs can also be used in certain situations to describe the results of the interpretation of a [[DNA profiling|DNA mixture]]. &lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=John |title=Forensic DNA Typing |date=2005 |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |pages=445-529 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other statistical tools to describe DNA mixture profiles include likelihood ratios (LR) and combined probability of inclusion (CPI), also known as random man not excluded (RMNE).&lt;ref name="Butler2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=John |title=Advanced Topics in Forensic DNA Typing: Interpretation |date=2015 |publisher=Elsevier Inc. |location=San Diego, CA |pages=213-333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer programs have been implemented with forensic DNA statistics for assessing the biological relationships between two or more people. Forensic science uses several approaches for DNA statistics with computer programs such as; match probability, exclusion probability, likelihood  ratios, Bayesian approaches, and paternity and kinship testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = On Statistical Analysis Of Forensic DNA: Theory, Methods And Computer Programs|last = Fung|first = Wing Kam|date = 2006|journal = Forensic Science International|doi = 10.1016/j.forsciint.2006.06.025|pmid = |access-date =|volume=162|pages=17–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the precise origin of this term remains unclear, it is apparent that the term was used in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Valentin | first1 = J | year = 1980 | title = Exclusions and attributions of paternity: practical experiences of forensic genetics and statistics | url = | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 420–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the first forensic statistics conferences were two held in 1991 and 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Aitken C. G. G., Taroni F. (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=5qvLJXYQ5wEC&amp;pg=PR26&amp;lpg=PR26&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RmrRyl5DOu&amp;sig=F0kgZ3FoAzbVtqHt3ls6bgxzno4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_ZDzUfX4H8GMkwWCjIGIDg&amp;ved=0CIMBEOgBMAw4Hg#v=onepage&amp;f=false ''Statistics and the Evaluation of Evidence for Forensic Scientists''], John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Random Match Probability ==

Random match probabilities (RMP) are used to estimate and express the rarity of a DNA profile. RMP can be defined as the probability that someone else in the population, chosen at random, would have the same genotype as the genotype of the contributor of the forensic evidence. RMP is calculated using the [[genotype frequencies]] at all the loci, or how common or rare the alleles of a genotype are. The genotype frequencies are multiplied across all loci, using the [[product rule]], to calculate the RMP. This statistic gives weight to the evidence either for or against a particular suspect being a contributor to the DNA mixture sample.&lt;ref name="Butler2"/&gt;

RMP can only be used as a statistic to describe the DNA profile if it is from a single source or if the analyst is able to differentiate between the peaks on the [[electropherogram]] from the major and minor contributors of a mixture.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; Since the interpretation of DNA mixtures with more than two contributors is very difficult for analysts to do without computer software, RMP becomes difficult to calculate with a mixture of more than two people.&lt;ref name="Butler2"/&gt; If the major and minor contributor peaks can not be differentiated, there are other statistical methods that may be used. 

If the DNA mixture contains a ratio of 4:1 of major to minor contributors, a modified random match probability (mRMP) may be able to be used as a statistical tool. For calculation of mRMP, the analyst must first deduce a major and minor contributor and their genotypes based on the peak heights given in the electropherogram. Computer software is often used in labs conducting DNA analysis in order to more accurately calculate the mRMP, since calculations for each of the most probable genotypes at each locus become tedious and inefficient for the analyst to do by hand.&lt;ref name="Perlin"/&gt;

== Likelihood Ratio ==

Sometimes it can be very difficult to determine the number of contributors in a DNA mixture. If the peaks are easily distinguished and the number of contributors is able to be determined, a likelihood ratio (LR) is used. LRs consider probabilities of events happening and rely on alternative pairs of hypotheses against which the evidence is assessed.&lt;ref name="FSS"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is a likelihood ratio? |url=https://www.isfg.org/files/ISFG2007_Statistics_Gill_LR.pdf |website=International Society of Forensic Genetics |publisher=Forensic Science Service Ltd. 2006 |accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These alternative pairs of hypotheses in forensic cases are the prosecutor’s hypothesis and the defense hypothesis. In forensic biology cases, the hypotheses often state that the DNA came from a particular person or the DNA came from an unknown person.&lt;ref name="Perlin"/&gt; For example, the prosecution may hypothesize the DNA sample contains DNA from the victim and the suspect, while the defense may hypothesize that the sample contains DNA from the victim and an unknown person. The probabilities of the hypotheses are expressed as a ratio, with the prosecutor’s hypothesis being in the numerator.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; The ratio then expresses the likelihood of both of the events in relation to each other. For the hypotheses where the mixture contains the suspect, the probability is 1, because one can distinguish the peaks and easily tell if the suspect can be excluded as a contributor at each locus based on his/her genotype. The probability of 1 assumes the suspect can not be excluded as a contributor. To determine the probabilities of the unknowns, all genotype possibilities must be determined for that locus.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; 

Once the calculation of the likelihood ratio is made, the number calculated is turned into a statement to provide meaning to the statistic. For the previous example, if the LR calculated is x, then the LR means that the probability of the evidence is x times more likely if the sample contains the victim and the suspect than if it contains the victim and an unknown person.&lt;ref name="FSS"/&gt; Likelihood ratio can also be defined as 1/RMP.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt;   

== Combined Probability of Inclusion ==

Combined probability of inclusion (CPI) is a common statistic used when the analyst can not differentiate between the peaks from a major and minor contributor to a sample and the number of contributors can not be determined.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; CPI is also commonly known as random man not excluded (RMNE).&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; This statistical calculation is done by adding all the frequencies of observed alleles and then squaring the value, which yields the value for probability of inclusion (PI). These values are then multiplied across all loci, resulting in the value for CPI.&lt;ref name="Perlin"/&gt; The value is squared so that all the possible combinations of genotypes are included in the calculation.&lt;ref name="Butler2"/&gt; 

Once the calculation is done, a statement is made about the meaning of this calculation and what it means. For example, if the CPI calculated is 0.5, this means that the probability of someone chosen at random in the population not being excluded as a contributor to the DNA mixture is 0.5. 

CPI relates to the evidence (the DNA mixture) and it is not dependent on the profile of any suspect. Therefore, CPI is a statistical tool that can be used to provide weight or strength to evidence when no other information about the crime is known.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; This is advantageous in situations where the genotypes in the DNA mixture can not be distinguished from one another. However, this statistic is not very discriminating and is not as powerful of a tool as likelihood ratios and random match probabilities can be when some information about the DNA mixture, such as the number of contributors or the genotypes of each contributor, can be distinguished. Another limitation to CPI is that it is not usable as a tool for the interpretation of a DNA mixture.&lt;ref name="Butler2"/&gt;

== Blood Stains ==
Blood stains are an important part of forensic statistics, as the analysis of blood drop collisions may help to picture the event that had previously gone on. Commonly blood stains are an elliptical shape, because of this blood stains are usually easy to determine the blood droplets angle through the formula “''α = arcsin d/a''”. In this formula 'a' and 'd' are simply estimations of the axis of the ellipse. From these calculations, a visualization of the event causing the stains is able to be drawn, and alongside further information such as the velocity of the entity that caused such stains.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Determining The Area Of Convergence In Bloodstain Pattern Analysis: A Probabilistic Approach|last = Camana|first = Francesco|date = 2013|journal = Forensic Science International|doi = 10.1016/j.forsciint.2013.04.019|pmid = |access-date =|volume=231|pages=131–136|arxiv =1210.6106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Globalization and World Cities Research Network''', commonly abbreviated to '''GaWC''', is a [[think tank]] that studies the relationships between [[global city|world cities]] in the context of [[globalization]]. It is based in the [[geography]] department of [[Loughborough University]] in [[Leicestershire]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]]. GaWC was founded by [[Peter J. Taylor]] in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Peter J.|title=World city network: a global urban analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RKpvD7nvBKUC&amp;pg=PR9|accessdate=2010-10-10|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-30249-8|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Together with Jon Beaverstock and [[Richard G. Smith (geographer)|Richard G. Smith]], they create the GaWC's bi-annual categorization of world cities into "Alpha", "Beta" and "Gamma" tiers, based upon their international connectedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Donald|first1=Stephanie|last2=Gammack|first2=John G.|title=Tourism and the branded city|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gcAx3bjuC98C&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=2010-10-10|year=2007 |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |location=London|isbn=0-7546-4829-X|page=23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== GaWC city classification ==
The GaWC examines cities worldwide to narrow them down to a roster of world cities, then ranks these based on their connectivity through four "advanced producer services": accountancy, advertising, banking/finance, and law.&lt;ref name = "intro"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2018link.html |title=GaWC – The World According to GaWC 2018|publisher=Lboro.ac.uk |date= 13 November 2018|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GaWC inventory ranks city [[economics]] more heavily than political or cultural factors. Beyond the categories of "Alpha" world cities (with four sub-categories), "Beta" world cities (three sub-categories) and "Gamma" world cities (three sub-categories), the GaWC cities include additional cities at "High sufficiency" and "Sufficiency" level.

The 2004 rankings added several new indicators while continuing to rank city [[economics]] more heavily than political or cultural factors. The 2008 roster, similar to the 1998 version, is sorted into categories of Alpha world cities (with four sub-categories), Beta world cities (three sub-categories), Gamma world cities (three sub-categories) and additional cities with High sufficiency or Sufficiency presence. 

== 2018 city classification ==
The cities in the 2018 classification are as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2018t.html|title=The World According to GaWC 2018|date=14 Nov 2018|publisher=GaWC|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|New cities}}
Cities which did not appear in the 2016 edition of the classification are marked with *. 

=== Alpha ===
Alpha level cities are linked to major economic states and regions into the world economy, and are classified into four sections, Alpha ++, Alpha +, Alpha, and Alpha − cities.

==== Alpha ++ ====
Alpha ++ cities are cities most integrated with the global economy:

[[Paper]], a thin unwoven material made from milled plant fibers, is primarily used for writing, artwork, and packaging; it is commonly white. The first [[papermaking]] process was documented in China during the [[Eastern Han]] period (25–220 CE), traditionally attributed to the court official [[Cai Lun]]. During the 8th century, Chinese papermaking spread to the [[Islamic world]], where [[pulp mill]]s and [[paper mill]]s were used for papermaking and money making. By the 11th century, papermaking was brought to Europe. By the 13th century, papermaking was refined with paper mills utilizing [[waterwheel]]s in Spain. Later European improvements to the papermaking process came in the 19th century with the invention of [[Wood pulp|wood-based]] papers.

Although precursors such as [[papyrus]] and [[amate]] existed in the [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean world]] and [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian Americas]], respectively, these materials are not defined as true paper. Nor is true [[parchment]] considered paper{{efn|Confusingly, parchment ''paper'' is a treated paper used in baking, and unrelated to true parchment.}}; used principally for writing, parchment is heavily prepared animal skin that predates paper and possibly papyrus. In the twentieth century with the advent of plastic manufacture some plastic "paper" was introduced, as well as paper-plastic laminates, paper-metal laminates, and papers infused or coated with different products that give them special properties. 

==Precursors: papyrus==
[[File:Papyrus.jpg|thumb|right|In contrast to paper, papyrus has an uneven surface that visibly retains the original structure of the ribbon-like strips that make it up. As the papyrus is worked, it tends to break apart along the seams, leading to long linear cracks and eventually falling apart.]]
[[File:Busto maschile.JPG|thumb|[[Roman portraiture]] fresco of a young man with a [[papyrus]] [[scroll]], from [[Herculaneum]], 1st century CE]]
The word "paper" is etymologically derived from ''papyrus'', [[Ancient Greek]] for the ''[[Cyperus papyrus]]'' plant. [[Papyrus]] is a thick, paper-like material produced from the pith of the ''Cyperus papyrus'' plant which was used in [[ancient Egypt]] and other [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean societies]] for [[History of writing|writing]] long before paper was used in China.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Papyrus
|title=Papyrus definition
| work=Dictionary.com
|accessdate=2008-11-20

|first=
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Papyrus is prepared by cutting off thin ribbon-like strips of the interior of the ''Cyperus papyrus'', and then laying out the strips side-by-side to make a sheet. A second layer is then placed on top, with the strips running at right angle to the first. The two layers are the pounded together into a sheet. The result is very strong, but has an uneven surface, especially at the edges of the strips. When used in scrolls, repeated rolling and unrolling causes the strips to come apart again, typically along vertical lines. This effect can be seen in many ancient papyrus documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paper contrasts with papyrus in that the plant material is broken down through maceration or disintegration before the paper is pressed. This produces a much more even surface, and no natural weak direction in the material which falls apart over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|It is lucky chance that the date of CE 105 was recorded, because Cai Lun, the official involved, who seems to have introduced some improvements in paper manufacture, worked at the palace as a eunuch. Yet just because the new technology was not trumpeted at the time does not mean that it had no effect. On the contrary: up to this point China was lagging behind those Mediterranean societies where papyrus was used and where light, inexpensive scrolls could be created. But thereafter the advantage swung the other way, since papyrus, which is composed of organic material not as highly processed as paper, was prone to splitting and deterioration at a much greater rate; this may be why vellum eventually came to dominate, especially in the harsher climate of Northern Europe. Paper, by contrast, gave a good, uniform writing surface that could be smoothly rolled and unrolled without damage, while remaining relatively durable.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=34}}|T.H. Barrett}}

{{Main|Papermaking}}
{{Further|Cai Lun#Invention of paper|Science and technology of the Han Dynasty}}

Archaeological evidence of [[papermaking]] predates the traditional attribution given to [[Cai Lun]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; an imperial eunuch official of the [[Han dynasty]] (202 BCE – CE 220), thus the exact date or inventor of paper can not be deduced.

"Cai Lun's" invention, recorded hundreds of years after it took place, is dated to 105 CE. The innovation is a type of paper made of [[mulberry]] and other [[bast fibre]]s along with [[fishing nets]], old rags, and [[hemp]] waste which reduced the cost of paper production, which prior to this, and later, in the West, depended solely on rags.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=908}}&lt;ref&gt;Papermaking.

===Techniques===
During the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] (1600–1050 BCE) and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] (1050–256 BCE) dynasties of [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], documents were ordinarily written on bone or [[bamboo]] (on tablets or on bamboo strips sewn and rolled together into scrolls), making them very heavy, awkward, and hard to transport. The light material of [[silk]] was sometimes used as a recording medium, but was normally too expensive to consider. The [[Han dynasty]] Chinese court official [[Cai Lun]] (c. 50–121 CE) is credited as the inventor of a method of papermaking (inspired by wasps and bees) using rags and other plant fibers in 105 CE.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=34}} However, the discovery of specimens bearing written [[Chinese character]]s in 2006 at [[Fangmatan]] in north-east China's [[Gansu]] Province suggests that paper was in use by the ancient Chinese military more than 100 years before Cai, in 8 BCE, and possibly much earlier as the map fragment found at the Fangmatan tomb site dates from the early 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref name="buisseret 1998 p12"/&gt; It therefore would appear that "Cai Lun's contribution was to improve this skill systematically and scientifically, fix a recipe for papermaking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-08/08/content_4937457.htm|title=eNewsletter|publisher=World Archeological Congress|date=August 2006|accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record in the ''[[Twenty-Four Histories]]'' says&lt;ref name=needham&gt;
{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=40}} uses Wade-Giles transcription&lt;/ref&gt;
:In ancient times writings and inscriptions were generally made on tablets of bamboo or on pieces of silk called chih. But silk being costly and bamboos heavy they were not convenient to use. Tshai Lun then initiated the idea of making paper from the bark of trees, remnants of hemp, rags of cloth and fishing nets. He submitted the process to the emperor in the first year of Yuan-Hsing (105 CE) and received praise for his ability. From this time, paper has been in use everywhere and is universally called the paper of Marquis Tshai.

The production process may have originated from the practice of pounding and stirring rags in water, after which the matted fibres were collected on a mat. The bark of [[paper mulberry]] was particularly valued and high quality paper was developed in the late Han period using the bark of ''tan'' (檀; [[sandalwood]]). In the [[Eastern Jin]] period a fine bamboo screen-mould treated with insecticidal dye for permanence was used in papermaking. After [[printing]] was popularized during the [[Song dynasty]] the demand for paper grew substantially. In the year 1101, 1.5 million sheets of paper were sent to the capital.&lt;ref name=needham /&gt;

===Uses===

{{quotation|Open, it stretches; closed, it rolls up. it can be contracted or expanded; hidden away or displayed.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=908}}|Fu Xian}}

Among the earliest known uses of paper was padding and wrapping delicate bronze mirrors according to archaeological evidence dating to the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] from the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Padding doubled as both protection for the object as well as the user in cases where poisonous "medicine" were involved, as mentioned in the official history of the period.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122"/&gt; Although paper was used for writing by the 3rd century CE,&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; paper continued to be used for wrapping (and other) purposes. [[Toilet paper]] was used in China from around the late 6th century.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 589, the Chinese scholar-official [[Yan Zhitui]] (531–591) wrote: "Paper on which there are quotations or commentaries from [[Five Classics]] or the names of [[Wise old man|sage]]s, I dare not use for toilet purposes".&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"/&gt; An [[Arab]] traveler who visited China wrote of the curious Chinese tradition of toilet paper in 851, writing: "...&amp;nbsp;[the Chinese] do not wash themselves with water when they have done their necessities; but they only wipe themselves with paper".&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"/&gt;

During the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) paper was folded and sewn into square bags to preserve the flavor of [[tea]]. In the same period, it was written that tea was served from baskets with multi-colored paper cups and paper napkins of different size and shape.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122" /&gt; During the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) the government produced the world's first known paper-printed money, or [[banknote]] (''see [[Jiaozi (currency)|Jiaozi]] and [[Huizi (currency)|Huizi]]''). Paper money was bestowed as gifts to government officials in special paper [[envelope]]s.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"/&gt; During the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368), the first well-documented [[Europeans in Medieval China]], the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] merchant [[Marco Polo]] remarked how the Chinese burned paper [[effigy|effigies]] shaped as male and female servants, camels, horses, suits of clothing and armor while [[Cremation|cremating]] the dead during [[Funerary art|funerary rites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact of paper===
According to Timothy Hugh Barrett, paper played a pivotal role in early Chinese written culture, and a "strong reading culture seems to have developed quickly after its introduction, despite political fragmentation."{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=36}} Indeed the introduction of paper had immense consequences for the book world. It meant books would no longer have to be circulated in small sections or bundles, but in their entirety. Books could now be carried by hand rather than transported by cart. As a result individual collections of literary works increased in the following centuries.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=909}}

Textual culture seems to have been more developed in the south by the early 5th century, with individuals owning collections of several thousand scrolls. In the north an entire palace collection might have been only a few thousand scrolls in total.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=37}} By the early 6th century, scholars in both the north and south were capable of citing upwards of 400 sources in commentaries on older works.{{sfn|Barret|2008|p=37-38}} A small compilation text from the 7th century included citations to over 1,400 works.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=38}}

The personal nature of texts was remarked upon by a late 6th century imperial librarian. According to him, the possession of and familiarity with a few hundred scrolls was what it took to be socially accepted as an educated man.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=39}} 

According to Endymion Wilkinson, one consequence of the rise of paper in China was that "it rapidly began to surpass the Mediterranean empires in book production."{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=908}} During the Tang dynasty, China became the world leader in book production. In addition the gradual spread of [[woodblock printing]] from the late Tang and Song further boosted their lead ahead of the rest of the world.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=935}}

{{quotation|From the fourth century CE to about 1500, the biggest library collections in China were three to four times larger than the largest collections in Europe. The imperial government book collections in the Tang numbered about 5,000 to 6,000 titles (89,000 ''juan'') in 721. The Song imperial collections at their height in the early twelfth century may have risen to 4,000 to 5,000 titles. These are indeed impressive numbers, but the imperial libraries were exceptional in China and their use was highly restricted. Only very few libraries in the Tang and Song held more than one or two thousand titles (a size not even matched by the manuscript collections of the grandest of the great cathedral libraries in Europe).{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=934}}|Endymion Wilkinson}}

However despite the initial advantage afforded to China by the paper medium, by the 9th century its spread and development in the middle east had closed the gap between the two regions. Between the 9th to early 12th centuries, libraries in Cairo, Baghdad, and Cordoba held collections larger than even the ones in China, and dwarfed those in Europe. From about 1500 the maturation of paper making and printing in Southern Europe also had an effect in closing the gap with the Chinese. The Venetian [[Domenico Grimani]]'s collection numbered 15,000 volumes by the time of his death in 1523. After 1600, European collections completely overtook those in China. The Bibliotheca Augusta numbered 60,000 volumes in 1649 and surged to 120,000 in 1666. In the 1720s the Bibliotheque du Roi numbered 80,000 books and the Cambridge University 40,000 in 1715. After 1700, libraries in North America also began to overtake those of China, and toward the end of the century, [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s private collection numbered 4,889 titles in 6,487 volumes. The European advantage only increased further into the 19th century as national collections in Europe and America exceeded a million volumes while a few private collections, such as that of Lord Action, reached 70,000.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=934}}

{{quotation|European book production began to catch up with China after the introduction of the mechanical printing press in the mid fifteenth century. Reliable figures of the number of imprints of each edition are as hard to find in Europe as they are in China, but one result of the spread of printing in Europe was that public and private libraries were able to build up their collections and for the first time in over a thousand years they began to match and then overtake the largest libraries in China.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=935}}|Endymion Wilkinson}}

Paper became central to the three arts of China – poetry, painting, and calligraphy. In later times paper constituted one of the 'Four Treasures of the Scholar's Studio,' alongside the brush, the ink, and the inkstone.{{sfn|Barret|2008|p=40}}

==Paper in Asia==

{{see|Dunhuang manuscripts}}

After its origin in central [[China]], the production and use of paper spread steadily. It is clear that paper was used at [[Dunhuang]] by 150 CE, in [[Loulan]] in the modern-day province of [[Xinjiang]] by 200, and in [[Turpan]] by 399.  Paper was concurrently introduced in [[Japan]] sometime between the years 280 and 610.&lt;ref&gt;DeVinne, Theo. L. ''The Invention of Printing''.

In Muslim countries they made books lighter—sewn with silk and bound with leather-covered paste boards; they had a flap that wrapped the book up when not in use. As paper was less reactive to humidity, the heavy boards were not needed.

The oldest known paper document in the West is the [[Mozarab]] [[Missal of Silos]] from the 11th century, probably using paper made in the [[Al-Andalus|Islamic part of the Iberian Peninsula]]. They used [[hemp]] and [[linen]] rags as a source of fiber. The first recorded paper mill in the Iberian Peninsula was in [[Xàtiva]] in 1056.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Leslie Hills: ''Papermaking in Britain 1488–1988: A Short History.''

Papermaking reached [[Europe]] as early as 1085 in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and was firmly established in [[Xàtiva]], [[Spain]] by 1150.  It is clear that [[France]] had a paper mill by 1190, and by 1276 mills were established in [[Fabriano]], [[Italy]] and in [[Treviso]] and other northern Italian towns by 1340.  Papermaking then spread further northwards, with evidence of paper being made in [[Troyes]], [[France]] by 1348, in [[Holland]] sometime around 1340–1350, in [[Mainz]], [[Germany]] in 1320, and in [[Nuremberg]] by 1390 in a mill set up by [[Ulman Stromer]].&lt;ref name=fuller&gt;{{cite web|last=Fuller|first=Neathery Batsell|title=A Brief history of paper|year=2002|url=http://users.stlcc.edu/nfuller/paper/|accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was just about the time when the [[woodcut]] [[printmaking]] technique was transferred from fabric to paper in the [[old master print]] and [[popular prints]]. There was a paper mill in [[Switzerland]] by 1432 and the first mill in [[England]] was set up by [[John Tate (papermaker)|John Tate]] in 1490 near [[Stevenage]] in [[Hertfordshire]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manufactura.cz/historie.htm Historie ručního papíru&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but the first commercially successful paper mill in [[Great Britain|Britain]] did not occur before 1588 when [[John Spilman]] set up a mill near [[Dartford]] in [[Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dartfordarchive.org.uk/technology/paper.shtml|title=Dartford, cradle of Britain's papermaking industry|accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, paper making spread to [[Poland]] by 1491, to [[Austria]] by 1498, to [[Russia]] by 1576, to the [[Netherlands]] by 1586, to [[Denmark]] by 1596, and to [[Sweden]] by 1612.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Arab prisoners who settled in a town called [[Borgo Saraceno]] in the Italian [[Province of Ferrara]] introduced [[Fabriano]] artisans in the [[Province of Ancona]]{{huh|date=April 2016}}&lt;!-- is this the wrong Borgo Saraceno? they seem very far apart--&gt; the technique of making paper by hand.  At the time they were renowned for their wool-weaving and manufacture of cloth.  Fabriano papermakers considered the process of making paper by hand an art form and were able to refine the process to successfully compete with parchment which was the primary medium for writing at the time.  They developed the application of stamping hammers to reduce rags to pulp for making paper, [[sizing]] paper by means of [[animal glue]], and creating watermarks in the paper during its forming process. The Fabriano used glue obtained by boiling scrolls or scraps of animal skin to size the paper; it is suggested that this technique was recommended by the local [[tannery|tanneries]]. The introduction of the first European watermarks in Fabriano was linked to applying metal wires on a cover laid against the mould which was used for forming the paper.&lt;ref name="gasparinetti"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10079/bibid/11263265|title=Early Italian papermaking : a crucial technical revolution|last1=Hills|first1=Richard|date=1936|pages=37–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Americas==

[[File:Huex_codex_1a_loc.jpg|thumb|[[Amate]] is similar to modern paper but has a more fibrous texture.]]

In the Americas, archaeological evidence indicates that a similar bark-paper writing material was used by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]ns no later than the 5th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathcs.duq.edu/~tobin/maya/ The Construction of the Codex In Classic- and post classic-Period Maya Civilization] Maya Codex and Paper Making&lt;/ref&gt; Called ''[[amatl]]'' or ''[[amate]]'', it was in widespread use among [[Mesoamerican]] cultures until the [[Spanish conquest]]. The earliest sample of [[amate]] was found at [[Huitzilapa]] near the [[Magdalena Municipality, Jalisco]], Mexico, belonging to the [[shaft tomb culture]]. It is dated to 75 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Benz, Bruce; Lorenza Lopez Mestas; Jorge Ramos de la Vega (2006). "Organic Offerings, Paper, and Fibers from the Huitzilapa Shaft Tomb, Jalisco, Mexico". Ancient Mesoamerica.== 17 (2). pp. 283–296.&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of amate is much more similar to paper than papyrus. The bark material is soaked in water, or in modern methods [[boiled]], so that it breaks down into a mass of fibres. They are then laid out in a frame and pressed into sheets. It is a true paper product in that the material is not in its original form, but the base material has much larger fibres than those used in modern papers. As a result, amate has a rougher surface than modern paper, and may dry into a sheet with hills and valleys as the different length fibres shrink.

European papermaking spread to the Americas first in [[Mexico]] by 1575 and then in [[Philadelphia]] by 1690.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Paper had traveled nearly halfway around the world, but no culture or civilization on its route had tried to mechanize its manufacture."'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general absence of the use of water-powered paper mills in Muslim papermaking prior to the 11th century is suggested by the habit of Muslim authors at the time to call a production center not a "mill", but a "paper manufactory".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414f.}}: {{quote|Indeed, Muslim authors in general call any "paper manufactory" a ''wiraqah'' – not a "mill" (''tahun'')}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Routledge Hill|Donald Hill]] has identified a possible reference to a water-powered [[paper mill]] in [[Samarkand]], in the 11th-century work of the Persian scholar [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]], but concludes that the passage is "too brief to enable us to say with certainty" that it refers to a water-powered paper mill.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A history of engineering in classical and medieval times|author=[[Donald Routledge Hill]]|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1996|isbn=0-415-15291-7|pages=169–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen by Halevi as evidence of Samarkand first harnessing waterpower in the production of paper, but notes that it is not known if waterpower was applied to papermaking elsewhere across the Islamic world at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Christian Impurity versus Economic Necessity: A Fifteenth-Century Fatwa on European Paper|author=Leor Halevi|journal=[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]|year=2008|volume=83|pages=917–945 [917–8]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|doi=10.1017/S0038713400017073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns remains sceptical, given the isolated occurrence of the reference and the prevalence of manual labour in Islamic papermaking elsewhere prior to the 13th century.&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 414−417"&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414−417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clear evidence of a water-powered paper mill dates to 1282 in the Spanish [[Kingdom of Aragon]].&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 417f."&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=417f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decree by the Christian king [[Peter III of Aragon|Peter III]] addresses the establishment of a royal "[[Watermill|molendinum]]", a proper hydraulic mill, in the paper manufacturing centre of [[Xàtiva]].&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 417f."/&gt; The crown innovation was operated by the Muslim [[Mudéjar]] community in the [[Moorish]] quarter of Xàtiva,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medieval Science, Technology, and Medicine: An Encyclopedia|author=[[Thomas F.

The first paper mill north of the Alps was established in [[Nuremberg]] by [[Ulman Stromer]] in 1390; it is later depicted in the lavishly illustrated ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stromer|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the mid-14th century onwards, European paper milling underwent a rapid improvement of many work processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stromer|1993|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the industrialisation of the paper production the most common fibre source was recycled fibres from used textiles, called rags. The rags were from [[hemp]], [[linen]] and [[cotton]].&lt;ref name=PST1&gt;{{Citation |last1=Göttsching|first1=Lothar|authorlink1= |last2=Pakarinen |first2=Heikki |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Recycled Fiber and Deinking|url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 7 |date= |year= 2000|month= |origyear= |publisher= Fapet Oy|location= Finland|isbn= 952-5216-07-1 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= 12–14 |chapter= 1|chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A process for removing printing inks from [[recycled paper]] was invented by German jurist [[Justus Claproth]] in 1774.&lt;ref name=PST1 /&gt; Today this method is called [[deinking]]. It was not until the introduction of [[wood pulp]] in 1843 that paper production was not dependent on recycled materials from [[ragpicker]]s.&lt;ref name=PST1 /&gt;

==19th-century advances in papermaking==
Although cheaper than vellum, paper remained expensive, at least in book-sized quantities, through the centuries, until the advent of steam-driven paper making machines in the 19th century, which could make paper with [[fibres]] from [[wood pulp]]. Although older machines predated it, the [[Fourdrinier machine|Fourdrinier]] papermaking machine became the basis for most modern papermaking. [[Robert brothers|Nicholas Louis Robert]] of [[Essonnes]], [[France]], was granted a patent for a continuous paper making machine in 1799. At the time he was working for [[Leger Didot]] with whom he quarrelled over the ownership of the invention. Didot sent his brother-in-law, John Gamble, to meet  Sealy and [[Henry Fourdrinier]], stationers of [[London]], who agreed to finance the project. Gamble was granted British [[patent]] 2487 on 20 October 1801. With the help particularly of [[Bryan Donkin]], a skilled and ingenious mechanic, an improved version of the Robert original was installed at [[Frogmore Paper Mill]], [[Hertfordshire]], in 1803, followed by another in 1804. A third machine was installed at the Fourdriniers' own mill at [[Two Waters]]. The Fourdriniers also bought a mill at [[St Neots]] intending to install two machines there and the process and machines continued to develop.

However, experiments with wood showed no real results in the late 18th century and at the start of the 19th century. By 1800, [[Matthias Koops]] (in London, England) further investigated the idea of using wood to make paper, and in 1801 he wrote and published a book titled ''Historical account of the substances which have been used to describe events, and to convey ideas, from the earliest date, to the invention of paper.''&lt;ref&gt;Koops, Matthias. Historical account of the substances which have been used to describe events, and to convey ideas, from the earliest date, to the invention of paper. London: Printed by T. Burton, 1800.&lt;/ref&gt; His book was printed on paper made from wood shavings (and adhered together). No pages were fabricated using the pulping method (from either rags or wood). He received financial support from the royal family to make his printing machines and acquire the materials and infrastructure needed to start his printing business. But his enterprise was short lived. Only a few years following his first and only printed book (the one he wrote and printed), he went bankrupt. The book was very well done (strong and had a fine appearance), but it was very costly.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, George. Paper in the Making. Toronto: The Garden City Press Co-Operative, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew, H.C.G. and Brian Harrison. "Koops. Matthias." Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: from the earliest times to the year 2000, Vol. 32. London: Oxford University Press, 2004: 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9783318-1-8}} pp.30–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in the 1830s and 1840s, two men on two different continents took up the challenge, but from a totally new perspective. Both [[Friedrich Gottlob Keller]] and [[Charles Fenerty]] began experiments with wood but using the same technique used in paper making; instead of pulping rags, they thought about pulping wood. And at about the same time, by mid-1844, they announced their findings. They invented a machine which extracted the fibres from wood (exactly as with rags) and made paper from it. Charles Fenerty also bleached the pulp so that the paper was white. This started a new era for paper making. By the end of the 19th-century almost all printers in the [[western world]] were using wood in lieu of rags to make paper.&lt;ref&gt;Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9783318-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the invention of the practical [[fountain pen]] and the mass-produced [[pencil]] of the same period, and in conjunction with the advent of the steam driven rotary [[printing press]], wood based paper caused a major transformation of the 19th century economy and society in industrialized countries. With the introduction of cheaper paper, schoolbooks, fiction, non-fiction, and newspapers became gradually available by 1900. Cheap wood based paper also meant that keeping personal diaries or writing letters became possible and so, by 1850, the [[clerk (position)|clerk]], or writer, ceased to be a high-status job.

The original wood-based paper was acidic due to the use of [[alum]] and more prone to disintegrate over time, through processes known as [[slow fires]]. Documents written on more expensive rag paper were more stable. Mass-market paperback books still use these cheaper mechanical papers (see below), but book publishers can now use [[acid-free paper]] for [[hardback]] and [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] books.

==Determining provenance==
Determining the provenance of paper is a complex process that can be done in a variety of ways.  The easiest way is using a known sheet of paper as an exemplar.  Using known sheets can produce an exact identification.  Next, comparing watermarks with those contained in catalogs or trade listings can yield useful results.  Inspecting the surface can also determine age and location by looking for distinct marks from the production process.  Chemical and fiber analysis can be used to establish date of creation and perhaps location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book: A Global History|first1=Michael F.|last1= Suarez, S.J.| last2=Woudhuysen|first2=H.R.|isbn=9780199679416|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sbacAQAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=OUP Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2015}}

'''The''' '''Holberg Prize''' is an international prize awarded annually by the [[government of Norway]] to outstanding scholars for work in [[the arts]], [[humanities]], [[social sciences]], law and theology, either within one of these fields or through interdisciplinary work. The prize is named after the Danish-Norwegian writer and academic [[Ludvig Holberg]] (1684 - 1754). The Holberg Prize comes with a monetary award of 6 million Norwegian kroner ([[Norwegian krone|NOK]]) (approximately $750 000 or €660 000), which are intended to be used to further the research of the recipient. The winner of the Holberg Prize is announced in March, and the award ceremony takes place every June in Bergen, Norway.

== History ==
The prize was established by the [[Parliament of Norway]] in honor of [[Ludvig Holberg]] in 2003 and complements its sister prize in mathematics, the [[Abel Prize]]. Ludvig Holberg, who excelled in all the disciplines covered by the award, played an important part in bringing the Enlightenment to the Nordic countries and is also well known as a playwright and author. The objective of the prize was to increase awareness of the value of academic scholarship in the arts,humanities, social sciences, law and theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://holbergprisen.no/en/about-holberg-prize|title=About the Holberg Prize|last=Longva|first=Hjørdis Maria|date=2010-02-18|work=Holbergprisen|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as the "Nobel Prize" for the arts and humanities, social sciences, law and theology.

== Selection criteria ==
The Holberg Prize is awarded annually to scholars who have made "outstanding contributions to research in the arts and humanities, social sciences, law or theology." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.holbergprisen.no/en/about-holberg-prize|title=About the Holberg Prize|last=Longva|first=Hjørdis Maria|date=2010-02-18|work=Holbergprisen|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars holding positions at universities and other research institutions, including academies, are eligible to nominate candidates to the Holberg Prize and the Nils Klim Prize. Self-nominations are not permitted. The Holberg Board awards the prize at the recommendation of the Holberg Committee.The Holberg Committee meets twice. At the first meeting, in early fall, they choose a shortlist from the nominations. The Committee then gather assessments on the short-list candidates from internationally recognized scholars before giving their final recommendation to the Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.holbergprisen.no/en/about-holberg-prize|title=About the Holberg Prize|last=Longva|first=Hjørdis Maria|date=2010-02-18|work=Holbergprisen|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==
The Holberg Prize is funded through a direct allocation from the Norwegian government's budget. It is administered by the University of Bergen on behalf of the Ministry of Education and Research. The University of Bergen appoints the executive board of the Holberg Prize. The Holberg Board consists of the board chair and four board member. The board members must work in different institutions, and at least one board member must work outside the university and university college sector. Board members are appointed for a period of four years and may be reappointed once. Current chair of the Holberg board is professor [[Sigmund Grønmo]]. 
[[File:Bergen Museum garden.jpg|thumb|''The Holberg Prize is awarded annually in the University Aula in Bergen.'']]

The Holberg Board awards the prize at the recommendation of the Holberg Committee who consists of five outstanding researchers in the arts and humanities, social sciences, law and theology. The current Holberg Prize Academic Committee is composed of: [[Hazel Genn|Dame Hazel Genn]] (Committee chairman, [[University College London]]), [http://www.swedishcollegium.se/subfolders/Fellows/Permanent_Fellows/bjorn.html Björn Wittrock] ([[Uppsala University]]), [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]] ([[University of Cambridge]]), [[Graeme Turner]] ([[University of Queensland|The University of Queensland]]) and [[Cui Zhiyuan]] ([[Tsinghua University|Tsinghua University).]]

Previous members of the Holberg Committee are among others: [[Mary Jacobus (academic)|Mary Jacobus]] ([[University of Cambridge]]), [[Helga Nowotny]] ([[ETH Zurich]]), [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] ([[New York University]]), [[Toril Moi]] ([[Duke University]]), [[Stein Kuhnle]] ([[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters|The Norwegian Academy og Science and Letters]]),  [[Johan Olsen|Johan P.

== The Holberg Week ==
During The Holberg Week in June, The Holberg Prize hosts a series of lectures, discussions and other events in honor of the Holberg Laureate and the Nils Klim Laureate. The events feature the laureates, as well as other high-profile international scholars. The program feature, among other things, the Holberg Symposium, the Nils Klim Seminar and the Holberg Lecture. All events during the Holberg week, with the exception of the award ceremony and government banquet, are open to all and have free entrance. Several of the events are also livestreamed, and available to an international audience.

In addition to The Holberg Week, The Holberg Debate is held in December each year. The debate marks Ludvig Holberg's ideas of enlightenment, and seeks to discuss and find answers to key social issues. The Holberg Debate was held for the first time in 2016. Former participants in the Holberg Debate are [[Timothy Garton Ash]], [[Jostein Gripsrud]], [[Jonathan Heawood]], [[John Pilger]] and [[Julian Assange]].

== Other prizes ==
As part of its research dissemination targeting younger people, the Holberg Prize also awards two other prizes:

*'''The Nils Klim Prize''' is awarded annually to a younger Nordic researcher who has made an outstanding contribution to research in the arts and humanities, social science, law or theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.holbergprisen.no/en/nils-klim-prize|title=Nils Klim Prize|last=Longva|first=Hjørdis Maria|date=2015-03-05|work=Holbergprisen|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''I. M. Sechenov Institute of Evolutionary Physiology and Biochemistry''' ('''IEPHB''') is a facility in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]], dedicated to research in the fields of [[biochemistry]] and [[evolutionary physiology]].

== History ==

The Institute was founded as a research group in October 1950 by [[Leon Orbeli]], a physiologist and a longtime collaborator with [[Ivan Pavlov]].&lt;ref name="IEPHB"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.iephb.ru/eng/history.htm| title = About Institute| accessdate = 2007-02-21| work = IEPHB website| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070304185459/http://www.iephb.ru/eng/history.htm| archivedate = 2007-03-04| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, Orheli's research group included eight people. It subsequently expanded and transformed into the ''Laboratory of Evolutionary Physiology'' of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|USSR Academy of Sciences]], with the main object of studying functions of the nervous system in animals and man during [[ontogenesis]], and also the effects of [[ionizing radiation]] on animals. 

In 1956, the Laboratory became an Institute with Orbeli serving as the first Director of Evolutionary Physiology of the Academy of Sciences. The new Institute was named after [[Ivan Sechenov]].  By the end of 1957, the Institute numbered 9 laboratories, one of them being transferred from the former [[Peter Lesgaft|P.F. Lesgaft]] Institute for Natural Sciences.

After Leon Orbeli's death in 1958, the Institute was headed by his collaborator Professor Alexander Ginetsinsky.  From June 1960 to March 1975, the Institute was guided by Eugenie Kreps: a former pupil of [[Ivan Pavlov]] and collaborator of Orbeli's, Kreps is known for his fundamental studies in the field of comparative physiology and biochemistry of the nervous system.  Kreps successfully promoted research in evolutionary biochemistry.  In response, in 1964, the Institute adopted its current name, ''I. M. Sechenov Institute of Evolutionary Physiology and Biochemistry''.

In November 1969, a monument to [[Academician]] Orbeli was erected in front of the first laboratory block on [[Maurice Thorez]] Prospect.

From 1975 to 1981 Institute was headed by [[Vladimir Govyrin]], and from 1981 to 2004 by Vladimir Svidersky.  Since 2004, the Institute has been headed by N. P. Vesselkin, Corresponding Member of RAS, a distinguished [[neuroscientist]], and head of the Laboratory of Neuronal Interaction.

== Journal of Evolutionary Biochemistry and Physiology ==

The Institute is publisher of the ''Journal of Evolutionary Biochemistry and Physiology'' (ISSN 0022-0930) which is abstracted in the ''Chemical Abstracts''. The journal is also available [https://archive.is/20130203151056/http://springeronline.com/journal/10893 online] by subscription only (online ISSN 1608-3202). Contents and abstracts are available [https://web.archive.org/web/20010413071337/http://www.maik.rssi.ru/cgi-bin/search.pl?type=contents&amp;name=evolbp online] in PDF format.

The station went [[silent (broadcasting)|silent]] on February 28, 2018 following the loss of its transmitter site, and is in the process of securing a new site in order to resume broadcasting.&lt;ref name="fcc-kkoloff"&gt;{{cite web |title=Notification of Suspension of Operations / Request for Silent STA |url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1780007&amp;Service=AM&amp;Form_id=910&amp;Facility_id=20355 |website=CDBS Public Access |publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]] |accessdate=June 27, 2018 |date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

KKOL is one of the oldest radio stations in the United States. It was first licensed, as KDZE, in May 1922.

==History==

===KDZE===
KKOL was first licensed, with the sequentially assigned call letters '''KDZE''', on May 23, 1922 to [[Rhodes Brothers#Rhodes Seattle|the Rhodes Company]] department store at 1321 Second Avenue in Seattle, Washington.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3221816;view=1up;seq=634 "New Stations"], ''Radio Service Bulletin'', June 1, 1922, page 4. Limited Commercial license, serial #417, issued May 23, 1922 for a three month period for operation on 360 meters to the Rhodes Company in Seattle, Washington.&lt;/ref&gt; C. B. Williams, the department store's advertising manager, coordinated the installation of the initial 50-watt transmitter.&lt;ref name="toastmaster"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/radiodigest19261618radi#page/n47/mode/1up "KFOA, Seattle, Toastmaster of Northwest"], ''Radio Digest'', January 16, 1926, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The station's glass-enclosed studio was located on the second floor of the store, where shoppers could observe its operation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87093407/1922-05-20/ed-1/seq-2/ "Rhodes Radio Unique in N.W."], ''Seattle Star'', May 20, 1922, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time there was only a single wavelength, 360 meters (833 kHz) available for "entertainment" broadcasts, so KDZE was required to make a time-sharing agreement with the other stations already in operation. On June 23 Seattle stations were scheduled to operate from noon to 10:30 p.m., with KDZE assigned the 3:30 to 4:15 p.m time period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87093407/1922-06-23/ed-1/seq-2/ "Radio Broadcasts"], ''Seattle Star'', June 23, 1922, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1923 the U.S. Commerce Department, which regulated radio at this time, made a range of frequencies available to "Class B" stations that had higher powers and better programming. The Seattle region was initially assigned 610 kHz, with 660 kHz assigned to Portland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/radioage12unse#page/n362/mode/1up/ "Radio Conference Recommendations: New Wave Lengths"], ''Radio Age'', May 1923, page 11. Beginning with these assignments radio stations ended the practice of broadcasting their market reports and weather forecasts on the separate 485 meter wavelength.&lt;/ref&gt; These two assignments were soon swapped, and in the summer of 1923 KDZE moved to 660 kHz.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3221817;view=1up;seq=160 "Alterations and Corrections"], ''Radio Service Bulletin'', August 1, 1923, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===KFOA===
In early 1924, in conjunction with an upgrade in facilities, the station's call letters were changed to '''KFOA'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3221817;view=1up;seq=256 "Alterations and Corrections"], ''Radio Service Bulletin'', February 1, 1924, page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the department store was issued a license to operate a second raido station, with 100 watts on 1110 kHz, which inherited the original KDZE call letters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3221817;view=1up;seq=249 "Alterations and Corrections"], ''Radio Service Bulletin'', February 1, 1924, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; This second KDZE was primarily used to broadcast the weekly Chamber of Commerce luncheons,&lt;ref&gt;"Radio Program", ''The Seattle Times'', 18 January 1924, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and was deleted in March 1925.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3221817;view=1up;seq=549 "Strike out all particulars"], ''Radio Service Bulletin'', April 1, 1925, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 11, 1928, under the provisions of a major reallocation resulting from the [[Federal Radio Commission]]'s (FRC) [[General Order 40]], KFOA was reassigned from 660 kHz to 1270 kHz, sharing the assignment with KTW (now [[KKDZ]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3221818;view=1up;seq=745 "Alterations and Corrections"], ''Radio Service Bulletin'', November 30, 1928, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next month the station was sold to the Seattle Broadcasting Company, headed by Archie Taft, at which time the call letters were changed to '''KOL''', and its studios were moved to the [[Seattle Tower|Northern Life Tower]].&lt;ref&gt;"KFOA is Sold, Call Letters Changed to KOL", ''The Seattle Times'', 9 December 1928, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 KTW moved to 1220&amp;nbsp;kHz, giving KOL unlimited use of 1270 kHz.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3221819;view=1up;seq=470 "Alterations and Corrections"], ''Radio Service Bulletin'', June 30, 1931, page 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1930 to 1938, KOL was Seattle's [[CBS Radio Network|CBS]] affiliate.&lt;ref&gt;John F. Schneider, ''Seattle Radio'', (Charleston SC: Arcadia Publishing, 2013), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 the station replaced the T-wire antenna on the Rhodes Department Store building's roof, moving to a new transmitter site on [[Harbor Island]], which featured a {{convert|490|ft|m|adj=on}} self-supporting tower, which at the time was the tallest of its type in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Radio Antenna of KOL Now is Tallest in U.S.", ''The Seattle Times'', 18 November 1934, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The studios were moved to the transmitter site in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Schnieder, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 29, 1941 the station, along with all the other stations on 1270 kHz, moved to 1300&amp;nbsp;kHz, the frequency KOL and its successors have occupied ever since, as part of the implementation of the [[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015080119129;view=1up;seq=23 ''Radio Broadcast Stations''], Federal Communications Commission (March 29, 1941 edition), page 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the Taft interests sold KOL to television producers and game show moguls [[Mark Goodson]] and [[Bill Todman]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/broadcastingtele63unse_0#page/n529/mode/1up "Changing Hands"], ''Broadcasting'', 29 October 1962, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; The station briefly adopted a [[top 40]] format which was dropped within a year due to a perceived failure to compete with [[KJR-AM|KJR]], and reverted to an [[Middle of the road (music)|MOR]] format.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Guykema, "KOL is Swinging Station With Some Serious Aims", ''The Seattle Times'', 17 November 1963, TV Section, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marty Loken, "Like It or Loop It, KJR's Still No. 1", ''The Seattle Times'', 12 April 1964, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, ''op. cit.'', p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1965 the top 40 format had returned.&lt;ref&gt;Marty Loken, "KOL's New Sound-Rock and Roll from the Mudflats", ''The Seattle Times'', 13 June 1965, TV Section, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1967, the station was sold to [[Buckley Broadcasting]].&lt;ref&gt;S.J. Skreen, "Leathernecks Land Again", ''The Seattle Times'', 21 March 1967, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1965 to 1975, KOL battled KJR as the number-one top 40 music station in Seattle.

===KMPS===
The call letters were changed to '''KMPS''' (for "[[Country music|Kountry Music]] Puget Sound") in 1975 following another change in ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Stredicke, "Multiple Messages behind Radio Station Call Letters", ''The Seattle Times'', 15 June 1975, TV Section, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victor Stredicke, "Country air staff, others get Labor Day Workout", ''The Seattle Times'', 1 September 1975, p. B-6.&lt;/ref&gt; During its days as KMPS, it simulcasted [[KSWD (FM)|KMPS-FM]] (94.1), the former frequency of KOL-FM.  The Harbor Island studio and transmitter site was demolished in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, ''op. cit.'', p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiyu4Xryb-M&lt;/ref&gt;

===KKOL===

After then-owners [[EZ Communications]] sold KMPS to [[Salem Communications]] in December 1996, the station's call letters were changed to '''KKOL''' in 1997, and a conservative talk format was adopted at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Taylor, "Summertime and News Just Keep Dribbling In", ''The Seattle Times'', 8 August 1997, p. F-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1996/R&amp;R-1996-12-20.pdf#page=9 "Transactions: Washington"], ''Radio &amp; Records'', 12 December 1996, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, after losing its transmitter site, KKOL installed a temporary 1,000-watt transmitter on a moored 175-foot (53 meter) cargo ship, and began to operate from a Seattle waterway. This was the only floating broadcasting station antenna in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.radioworld.com/news-and-business/aboard-the-coastal-ranger-seattle39s-kkol-goes-maritime-mobile "Aboard the Coastal Ranger: Seattle's KKOL Goes Maritime Mobile"], December 17, 2002 (radioworld.com)&lt;/ref&gt; and this unique configuration was used for almost five years. In 2007 the station started a news/talk format, and began use of a new broadcast facility and 50,000-watt transmitter. However, there was a complaint from a nearby [[U.S. Oil and Refining]] petroleum facility about the transmitter. There was concern that its proximity to the refinery produced electrical fields that exceeded safe limits at the loading docks, creating a potential source of ignition for the combustibles handled there. In particular, there was concern that a spark caused by the flow of [[Radio frequency|radio frequency (RF)]] energy (a high-frequency alternating current) within cranes, acting as receiving [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]s, could trigger an explosion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.seattlepi.com/ae/tv/article/KKOL-moves-to-bolster-its-signal-power-format-1234623.php "KKOL moves to bolster its signal power, format and market share"] by Bill Virgin, April 18, 2007 (seattlepi.com)&lt;/ref&gt; (This issue is a rarity in broadcast engineering, though a similar situation regarding fuel occurred at [[KIQI (AM)|KIQI]] in Oakland, California.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.radioworld.com/columns-and-views/big-oil-primary-issue-is-public-safety "Big Oil: Primary Issue Is Public Safety"], November 6, 2007 (radioworld.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[U.S. Coast Guard]] standards specified that materials may not be handled with a signal strength of greater than 0.7 [[volt]]s per square meter (700mV/m²), while the industry recommendation is 0.5V/m².  U.S. Oil's request was for the station to introduce a [[null (radio)|null]] toward the facility. However this was in the direction of downtown Seattle, which would necessitate a waiver of the regulation which requires radio stations to cover their [[city of license|community of license]] with a grade A "city-grade" signal. In addition, the proposed pattern had the effect of reducing that station's potential audience by 700,000 listeners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.radioworld.com/news-and-business/kkol-fights-to-keep-transmitter-site "KKOL Fights to Keep Transmitter Site"] by Scott Fybush, June 19, 2007 (radioworld.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 2008, KKOL switched from its news/talk format to [[Business news|all-business radio]].&lt;ref name="sip1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/386555_radiobeat06.html?source=rss |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |title=On Radio on Radio: KKOL-AM shifts to business news; Owner sees a market for new format |first=Bill |last=Virgin |date=November 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A portion of the station's programming was derived from [[Bloomberg L.P.]] and [[CNBC]].

In May 2018, Salem agreed to swap KKOL to Tron Dinh Do's Intelli LLC in exchange for 860 [[KPAM]] in [[Troutdale, Oregon]]. Salem had been operating KPAM via a [[local marketing agreement]] since March 2018. KPAM is conservative talk "860 The Answer" and simulcasts with "1590 The Answer" [[KLFE]] in Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/176681/salem-swaps-kkol-seattle-to-intelli-for-kpam-portl "Salem Swaps KKOL/Seattle To Intelli For KPAM/Portland"] May 15, 2018 (allaccess.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''law of the handicap of a head start''' (original [[dutch language|Dutch]]: ''[[:nl:Wet van de remmende voorsprong|Wet van de remmende voorsprong]]'') or '''dialectics of lead''' is a theory that suggests that an initial [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] in a given area may result in a handicap in the long term. The term was coined in 1937 by [[Jan Romein]], a Dutch [[journalist]] and [[historian]], in his essay "The dialectics of progress" ("De dialectiek van de vooruitgang"), part of the series ''The unfinished past'' (''Het onvoltooid verleden'').

==The phenomenon==
The ''law of the handicap of a head start'' describes a [[phenomenon]] that is applicable in numerous settings. The [[Principle|law]] suggests that making progress in a particular area often creates circumstances in which stimuli are lacking to strive for further progress. This results in the individual or group that started out ahead eventually being overtaken by others. In the [[terminology]] of the law, the ''head start'', initially an advantage, subsequently becomes a ''handicap''. 

An explanation for why the phenomenon occurs is that when a society dedicates itself to certain standards, and those standards change, it is harder for them to [[Adaptation|adapt]]. Conversely, a society that has not committed itself yet will not have this problem. Thus, a society that at one point has a head start over other societies, may, at a later time, be stuck with [[Obsolescence|obsolete]] [[technology]] or ideas that get in the way of further progress. One consequence of this is that what is considered to be the [[state of the art]] in a certain field can be seen as "jumping" from place to place, as each leader soon becomes a victim of the handicap. 

In common terms, societies, companies, and individuals are often confronted with the decision to either [[Investment|invest]] now and get a fast return, or put off the investment until a new technology has emerged and possibly make a bigger profit then. For example, a regular problem for individuals is the decision of when to buy a new [[computer]]. Since computer speed develops at a steady pace, delaying the investment for a year may mean having to make do with a slower (or no) computer for the first year, but after that the individual will be able to buy a better computer for the same price. In many cases, however, the technological development is not as predictable as this, so it is harder to make an informed decision.

A related law that can be considered as the contrary of this law is the ''Law of the stimulative arrears'' (''[[:nl:Wet van de stimulerende achterstand|Wet van de stimulerende achterstand]]'') published by Erik van der Hoeven in 1980.&lt;ref name=hoeven&gt;{{cite book|last=van der Hoeven|first=Erik|title=De wet van de stimulerende achterstand|year=1980|publisher=Bakker|location=[[Amsterdam]]|isbn=978-90-6019-742-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The author gives an example of the law in his original essay. During a trip to [[London]], he wonders why at that time it was still lit by [[Gas lighting|gas lamps]], rather than [[electric light]]s as were by then common in other [[Europe]]an capitals like [[Amsterdam]]. His explanation was that London's head start—their possession of street lights before most other cities—was now holding them back in replacing them with the more modern electric lights. As the streets were already lit there was no pressing need to replace gas lamps, despite the other advantages of electric lighting.

A modern example—an independent observation given not by the author—the internet situation in the US and Romania. Romania got access to the latest and the greatest equipment in a time where it hadn't laid down any cables, but the US has already done that in the past. Upgrades from the American point of view would like a waste of money, as their equipment is already "doing the job".{{OR|date=December 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1786">In biochemistry, the Luebering–Rapoport pathway (also called the Luebering–Rapoport shunt) is a [[metabolic pathway]] in mature [[erythrocytes]] involving the formation of [[2,3-bisphosphoglycerate]] (2,3-BPG), which regulates [[oxygen]] release from [[hemoglobin]] and delivery to tissues. 2,3-BPG, the reaction product of the Luebering-Rapoport pathway was first described and isolated in 1925 by the Austrian biochemist [[Samuel Mitja Rapoport]] and his technical assistant Janet Luebering.&lt;ref name="CRCLS1979"&gt;R. Juel: ''2,3-Diphosphoglycerate: its role in health and disease.'' In: ''CRC Critical Reviews in Clinical Laboratory Sciences.'' 10(2)/1979.

:[[File:Pathway of generation of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate.png|none|500px|]]{{clear-left}}

Through the Luebering–Rapoport pathway [[bisphosphoglycerate mutase]] catalyzes the transfer of a phosphoryl group from C1 to C2 of 1,3-BPG, giving 2,3-BPG. 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, the most concentrated organophosphate in the erythrocyte, forms 3-PG by the action of [[bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase]]. The concentration of 2,3-BPG varies proportionately with the pH, since it is inhibitory to catalytic action of bisphosphoglyceromutase.

The '''Mercedes-Benz Bionic''' was a [[concept car]] created by [[DaimlerChrysler AG]] under the [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] Group. It was first introduced in 2005 at the DaimlerChrysler Innovation Symposium in [[Washington, D. C.]] The Bionic was modeled after a type of [[fish]], the [[yellow boxfish]], ''Ostracion cubicus'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Bionic" Car Fueled by Fishy Ideas|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.co.uk/news/2005/06/0615_050615_fishcar.html|work=National Geographic|accessdate=18 October 2013|date=15 June 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019205924/http://news.nationalgeographic.co.uk/news/2005/06/0615_050615_fishcar.html|archivedate=19 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also has 80% lower [[nitrogen]] [[nitrogen oxide|oxide]] emissions with its [[selective catalytic reduction]] technology.

==Engine and performance==
The Bionic is powered by a 103&amp;nbsp;kW direct-injection [[diesel engine]] that gives out around 70 [[Miles per gallon|MPG (US)]] (~3.36 L/100&amp;nbsp;km). This engine also gives out around a total of {{convert|140|hp||0|abbr=on}} and a little over {{convert|221|ft·lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of [[torque]] at around 1600 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]. The Bionic can go from 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in about 8 seconds and has a top speed of a little over {{convert|190|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} .

==Design==
The exterior design was modeled after the yellow boxfish (''[[Ostracion cubicus]]''), a marine fish that lives in coral reefs. Mercedes-Benz decided to model the Bionic after this fish due to the supposed low [[coefficient of drag]] of its body shape and the rigidity of its [[exoskeleton]]; this influenced the car's unusual looks. Other parts of the design include the fact that the rear wheels are partially fitted with plastic and that it's considered as a lightweight vehicle. Mercedes-Benz reported a [[drag coefficient]] of 0.19;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/03/08/cars.fish.popsci/index.html Mercedes' fish-inspired car] CNN (retrieved 2008-08-12)&lt;/ref&gt; for comparison, the production vehicle with the lowest ever C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; value was the [[GM EV1]], at 0.195. While the Bionic had a much larger internal volume than the EV1, the Bionic's larger frontal area made the EV1 more aerodynamic overall, as drag is a product of the area and the drag coefficient.

'''Migration''', in [[ecology]], is the large-scale movement of members of a species to a different [[natural environment|environment]]. Migration is a natural behavior and component of the [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] of many species of mobile organisms, not limited to animals, though [[animal migration]] is the best known type. Migration is often cyclical, frequently occurring on a [[season]]al basis, and in some cases on a [[diurnal cycle|daily basis]]. Species migrate to take advantage of more favorable conditions with respect to [[food]] availability, safety from [[predation]], [[mating]] opportunity, or other environmental factors.&lt;ref name="WGU"&gt;{{cite web|title=Migration and dispersal|url=https://www.glyndwr.ac.uk/bartlett/ecology/migrat.htm|publisher=[[Wrexham Glyndŵr University]] |archiveurl=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:siigOkAmRoIJ:https://www.glyndwr.ac.uk/bartlett/ecology/migrat.htm+&amp;cd=12&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us|archivedate=October 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dorst|first1=Jean P.|title=Ecological Significance of Migration|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/migration-animal/Ecological-significance-of-migration|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Types of migration include:

'''Nematology''' is the scientific discipline concerned with the study of [[nematode]]s, or roundworms. Although nematological investigation dates back to the days of [[Aristotle]] or even earlier, nematology as an independent discipline has its recognizable beginnings in the mid to late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Chen2004"&gt;Chen, Z. X., Chen, S. Y., and Dickson, D. W. (2004). "A Century of Plant Nematology", pp. 1–42 in ''Nematology Advances and Perspectives'', Vol 1. Tsinghua University Press, Beijing, China.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chitwood1950"&gt;Chitwood, B. G., and Chitwood, M. B. (1950). "An Introduction to Nematology", pp. 1–5 in ''Introduction to Nematology''.  University Park Press, Baltimore.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History: pre-1850 ==

Nematology research, like most fields of science, has its foundations in observations and the recording of these observations. The earliest written account of a nematode "sighting," as it were, may be found in the Pentateuch of the [[Old Testament]] in the Bible, in the Fourth Book of Moses called Numbers: "And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died".&lt;ref&gt;Holy Bible, King James Version. (1979) p. 227. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Salt Lake City, Utah.&lt;/ref&gt; Although no empirical data exists to test the hypothesis, many nematologists assume and circumstantial evidence suggests the "fiery serpents" to be the Guinea worm, ''[[Dracunculus medinensis]]'', as this nematode is known to inhabit the region near the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref name="Chitwood1950"/&gt;

Before 1750, a large number of nematode observations were recorded, many by the notable great minds of ancient civilization. [[Hippocrates]]&lt;ref&gt;Hippocrates (460-375 B.C.) 1849.  Works of Hippocrates, translated by F. Adams. London,  "Aphorisms."&lt;/ref&gt; (ca. 420 B.C.), [[Aristotle]]&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle (384-322 B.C.) 1910.  Historia animalium.  Translated by [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]]. In: ''Works''. J. A. Smith and W. D. Ross, eds. Vol. IV. Garrison Morton.&lt;/ref&gt; (ca. 350 B.C.), [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]]&lt;ref&gt;Celsus, A. C.  (53 B.C.-7 A.D.) 1657. De medicina libri octo, ex recognitione Joh. Antonidae von Linden D. &amp; Prof. Med. Pract. Ord.&lt;/ref&gt; (ca 10 B.C.), [[Galen]]&lt;ref&gt;Galen, C.  (130–200) 1552. De simplicum medicamentorum faculatibus libre xi.  Lugdoni.&lt;/ref&gt; (ca. 180 A.D.) and [[Francesco Redi|Redi]]&lt;ref&gt;Redi, F. (1684) p. 253 in ''Osservazioni...intorno agli animali viventi che si trovano negli animali viventi''.  26 pls.  Firenze.&lt;/ref&gt; (1684) all described nematodes parasitizing humans or other large animals and birds. Borellus&lt;ref&gt;Borellus, P. (1653) p. 240 in ''Historiarum, et observationum medicophysicarum, centuria prima, etc.'' Castris.&lt;/ref&gt; (1653) was the first to observe and describe a free-living nematode, which he dubbed the "vinegar eel;" and Tyson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tyson, E. |title=Lumbricus Teres, or Some Anatomical Observations on the Round Worm Bred in Human Bodies. By Edward Tyson M. D. Col. Med. Lond. Nec Non. Reg. Societ. Soc|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|volume=13|issue=143–154|pages=154|doi=10.1098/rstl.1683.0023|year=1683}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1683) used a crude microscope to describe the rough anatomy of the human intestinal roundworm, ''[[Ascaris lumbricoides]]''.

Other well-known microscopists spent time observing and describing free-living and animal-parasitic nematodes: [[Robert Hooke|Hooke]]&lt;ref&gt;Hooke, R. (1667). ''Micrographia: etc.''  London.&lt;/ref&gt; (1683), [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek|Leeuwenhoek]]&lt;ref&gt;Leeuwenhoek, A. (1722). ''Opera omnia seu arcana naturae (etc.)''.  Lugduni Batavorum.&lt;/ref&gt; (1722), [[John Needham|Needham]]&lt;ref name="Needham1743"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Needham, T. |title=A Letter from Mr. Turbevil Needham, to the President; Concerning Certain Chalky Tubulous Concretions, Called Malm: With Some Microscopical Observations on the Farina of the Red Lily, and of Worms Discovered in Smutty Corn|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|volume=42|issue=462–471|pages=634|doi=10.1098/rstl.1742.0101|url=https://archive.org/stream/philtrans07586720/07586720_djvu.txt|year=1742}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1743), and [[Lazzaro Spallanzani|Spallanzani]]&lt;ref&gt;Spallanzani, L. (1769). ''Nouvelles recherches sur les decouvertes microscopiques, etc.''  Londres &amp; Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; (1769) are among these.&lt;ref name="Chitwood1950"/&gt; Observations and descriptions of plant parasitic nematodes, which were less conspicuous to ancient scientists, didn't receive as much or as early attention as did animal parasites. The earliest allusion to a plant parasitic nematode is, however, preserved in famous writ. "Sowed cockle, reap'd no corn," a line by [[William Shakespeare]] penned in 1594 in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'', Act IV, Scene 3, most certainly has reference to blighted wheat caused by the plant parasite, ''[[Anguina tritici]]''.&lt;ref name="Thorne1961"&gt;Thorne, G. (1961).  "Introduction", pp. 1–21 in ''Principles of Nematology''.  McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc., New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Needham&lt;ref name="Needham1743"/&gt; (1743) solved the "riddle of cockle" when he crushed one of the diseased wheat grains and observed "Aquatic Animals...denominated Worms, Eels, or Serpents, which they very much resemble." It is likely that few or no other recorded observations of plant parasitic nematodes or their effects are to be found in ancient literature.&lt;ref name="Steiner1960"&gt;Steiner, G. (1960). "Nematology-An Outlook", pp. 3–7 in ''Nematology: Fundamentals and Recent Advances''.  J. N. Sasser and W. R. Jenkins, eds. The University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1750 to the early 1900s, nematology research continued to be descriptive and taxonomic, focusing primarily on free-living nematodes and plant and animal parasites.&lt;ref name="VanGundy1987"&gt;Van Gundy, S. D. (1987). "Perspectives on Nematology Research", pp. 28–31 in ''Vistas on Nematology''. J. A. Veech and D. W. Dickson, eds.  Society of Nematologists, Inc. Hyattsville, Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period a number of productive researchers contributed to the field of nematology in the United States and abroad. Beginning with Needham and continuing to Cobb, nematologists compiled and continuously revised a broad descriptive morphological taxonomy of nematodes.

== History: 1850 to the present ==
[[Julius Kühn|Kuhn]]&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, J. (1874). "Ubers das Vorkommen von Ruben-Nematoden an den Wurzeln der Halmfruchte". ''Landwirts. Jahrb.''  3:47–50.&lt;/ref&gt; (1874) is thought to be the first to use soil [[fumigation]] to control nematodes, applying [[carbon disulfide]] treatments in sugar beet fields in Germany. In Europe from 1870 to 1910, nematological research focused heavily on controlling the sugar beet nematode as sugar beet production became an important economy during this time in the Old World.&lt;ref name="Thorne1961"/&gt;

Although 18th and 19th century scientists yielded a considerable amount of important fundamental and applied knowledge about nematode biology, nematology research really began to advance in quality and quantity near the turn of the 20th century. In 1918, the first permanent nematology field station was constructed in the U.S. Post Office in Salt Lake City, Utah under the direction of Harry B. Shaw, after scientists observed the sugar beet nematode in a field south of the city.&lt;ref name="Thorne1961"/&gt; In this same year, [[Nathan Cobb]] (1918) published his Contributions to a Science of Nematology and his lab manual "Estimating the Nema Population of Soil."&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, N. A. (1918). "Estimating the nema population of soil".  U.S. Department of Agriculture,  Bur. Plant. Indrusty,  Agr. Tech. Cir. 1:1–48.&lt;/ref&gt; These two publications provide definitive resources for many methods and apparatus used in nematology even to this day.&lt;ref name="Thorne1961"/&gt;

Of Cobb's far-reaching influence on nematology research, Jenkins and Taylor&lt;ref name="Jenkins1967"&gt;Jenkins, W. R., and Taylor, D. P. (1967). "Introduction", p. 7 in ''Plant Nematology''.  Reinhold Publishing Corporation, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; write:

:''Although many workers have played important roles in development of plant nematology, none have had a greater impact, particularly in the United States, than N.A. Cobb. In 1913 Cobb published his first paper on nematology in the United States. From [1913] to 1932 he was the undisputed leader in [nematology] in this country. Through his efforts the widely renowned [USDA] nematology research program was initiated and developed. Many of his students and colleagues developed into the leaders in plant nematology in the 1930s, 1940's, and 1950's. In addition, during his productive career he contributed major discoveries in the areas of nematode taxonomy, morphology, and in methodology. Many of his techniques are still unsurpassed!''

Perhaps no one person has had as favorable an impact on the field of nematology as has Nathan Augustus Cobb.

From 1900–1925 various state-run agricultural experimental stations investigated important problems relating to agro-economy, though few stations devoted much attention to plant-parasitic nematodes. Accounts of the history of nematology (the few that exist) mention three major events occurring between 1926 and 1950 that affected the relative importance of nematodes in the eyes of farmers, legislators and the U.S. public in general. These same events had profound worldwide effects on the course of nematology research over the next fifty to seventy-five years

First, the discovery of the [[Globodera rostochiensis|golden nematode]] in the potato fields of [[Long Island]] led to a trip by U.S. quarantine officials to the potato fields of Europe, where the devastating effects of this parasite had been known for many years. This excursion allayed all skepticism about the seriousness of this agricultural pest. Second, the introduction of the soil fumigants, D-D and [[1,2-Dibromoethane|EDB]] made available for the first time nematicides that could be used effectively and practically on a field scale. Third, the development of nematode-resistant crop cultivars brought substantial government funding to applied nematology research.&lt;ref name="Thorne1961"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VanGundy1987"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christie, J. R. (1960). "The Role of the Nematologist", pp. 8–11 in ''Nematology: Fundamentals and Recent Advances''.  J. N. Sasser and W. R. Jenkins, eds. The University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

These events contributed to a shift from broad taxonomy-based nematology research to deep, yet focused investigations of plant parasitic nematodes, especially the control of agricultural pests. From the early 1930s until recently, the bulk of researchers studying nematodes have been plant pathologists by training.&lt;ref name="VanGundy1987"/&gt;  Consequently, nematological research leaned heavily toward answering plant pathological and agro-economical questions for the last three-quarters of the 20th century.

''Ztschr. Wiss. Zool.'' v. 25:201–213.&lt;/ref&gt; (1875) first observed the formation of polar bodies by [[nuclear subdivision]] in a nematode, [[Edouard Van Beneden|Beneden]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Beneden, E. van.]] (1883). ''Recherches sur la maturation de l'oeuf, la fecondation et la division cellulaire''.  Gand &amp; Leipzig.&lt;/ref&gt; (1883) was studying ''Ascaris megalocephala'' when he discovered the separation of halves of each of the [[chromosome]]s from the two parents and the mechanism of Mendelian heredity, and [[Theodor Boveri|Boveri]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Boveri, T.]] (1893). "Ueber die Entstehung des Gegensatzes zwischen den Geschlectszellen und den somatischen Zellen bei Ascaris megalocephala, nebst Bemerkungen zur Entwicklungsgeschichte der Nematoden". ''Sitzungsb. Gesellsch. Morph. u. Physiol.'' in Munchen.&lt;/ref&gt; (1893) showed evidence for continuity of the germ plasm and that the soma may be regarded as a by-product without influence upon heredity.&lt;ref name="Chitwood1950"/&gt;

[[Caenorhabditis elegans]] is a widely used [[model species]], initially for neural development, and then for genetics. [[WormBase]] collates research on the species.

The '''New England Complex Systems Institute''' (NECSI) is a small [[United States|American]] research institution dedicated to advancing the study of [[complex systems]]. NECSI offers educational programs, conducts research, and hosts the International Conference on Complex Systems. It was founded in 1996 and is located in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Massachusetts.&lt;ref name = "NECSI"/&gt;

== Mission ==
NECSI was established in 1996 by faculty of various New England academic institutions, including [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Brandeis University|Brandeis]], and others, to encourage communication and collaboration among researchers studying complex systems.&lt;ref name="iccs2"/&gt;

The NECSI web site describes "[[complex systems]]" as follows:&lt;ref name="NECSI"/&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Complex systems have multiple interacting components whose [[collective behavior]] cannot be simply inferred from the behavior of components. The recognition that understanding the parts cannot explain collective behavior has led to various new concepts and methodologies that are affecting all fields of science and engineering, and are being applied to technology, business and even [[social policy]]. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Collaboration and Communication==

NECSI promotes collaboration and dissemination of new research among complex systems researchers in wide-ranging disciplines and numerous institutions. NECSI's activities for this purpose include hosting an international research conference and maintaining a roster of affiliated scholars and co-faculty.

=== International Conference on Complex Systems ===
NECSI hosts the International Conference on Complex Systems (ICCS), whose aims are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
first, to investigate those properties or characteristics that appear to be common to the very different complex systems now under study; and second, to encourage cross fertilization among the many disciplines involved.&lt;ref name = iccs8/&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
ICCS takes place on an occasional basis, with the most recent (eighth conference) in 2011. ICCS conferences have featured notable computer scientists (e.g., Gerald Sussman), mathematicians (e.g., Stephen Wolfram), systems theorists (e.g., [[John Sterman]]), physicists (e.g. Sandy Pentland), economists (e.g., James Stock), and others. 
Events at ICCS include research presentations and workshops, as well as pedagogical sessions aimed at a wider community.

=== Affiliates and Co-faculty ===
NECSI provides a public platform for affiliates and co-faculty at numerous academic institutions, primarily in the New England region. These researchers also contribute to NECSI educational programs.&lt;ref name = short_course /&gt;

== Research areas ==

=== Evolution and Ecology ===
NECSI researchers have contributed to the understanding of evolutionary dynamics, the evolution of [[altruism in animals|altruism]], the origin and characterization of [[biodiversity]], and the interplay between evolution and ecology.

Much of the work done at NECSI has focused on the role of the spatial distribution of species, an often overlooked factor of evolutionary dynamics. In the case where portions of a population are geographically isolated from each other, for example, [[Yaneer Bar-Yam]] was able to demonstrate shortcomings in the [[gene-centered view of evolution]], an approximation that is valid only if there is complete mixing of alleles in the gene pool.&lt;ref name="gene-centered" /&gt;

=== Networks ===
Studies of [[network topology|network topologies]] have found surprising similarities between a variety of complex social, technological and biological networks.  NECSI research in networks focuses on the relationship between structure, dynamics and function.

=== Social Systems ===
NECSI research in social systems focuses on the collective actions that create revolutions, ethnic violence, urban health, fads and panics, global food and so on. The role of individuals and organization can be analyzed by techniques and tools of [[complex systems]].

=== Representation ===
Complex systems exhibit behaviors at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Researchers working at NECSI have developed a mathematical formalism for simultaneously describing systems on multiple scales. This formalism had been applied to physical systems, information systems, organizational behavior, engineering projects and military conflict.

An essential tool for multiscale analysis, the complexity profile, the relationship between the observed complexity of a system and the scale of observation.

=== Post-crisis focus on social and economic systems ===
Since 2009, the Institute's research focus has shifted to socio-economic systems, with particular attention to the causes and consequences of the 2008 financial crisis and dynamics of Twitter networks and social sentiment. Policy relevant articles on stock market regulation and market crashes,&lt;ref name=market-interdependence /&gt;&lt;ref name = uptick/&gt;&lt;ref name=panic/&gt;&lt;ref name=bear-raid /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harmon D, Lagi M, de Aguiar MAM, Chinellato DD, Braha D, Epstein IR, et al. (2015). [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131871 "Anticipating Economic Market Crises Using Measures of Collective Panic."] PLoS ONE 10(7): e0131871.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0131871.&lt;/ref&gt; food riots and the causes of high food prices,&lt;ref name = foodprices/&gt;&lt;ref name=food-crises/&gt;&lt;ref name=food-update/&gt; and the European bond crisis&lt;ref name=europe-debt /&gt; have been released straight to the press. Peer reviewed articles continue to appear on other subjects.&lt;ref name=nyt-twitter /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc-twitter/&gt;&lt;ref name=ring-species /&gt;

=== Further fields of research ===
* [[Systems Biology]]
* [[Systems Engineering]]
* [[Management|Organizational management]]
* [[Negotiation]]

== Public attention ==
NECSI's work on the global food crisis has been widely cited by the press,&lt;ref name=time-coverage /&gt;&lt;ref name=wired-coverage /&gt;&lt;ref  name=motherboard-coverage /&gt; by movements to curb financial speculation,&lt;ref name=foodwatch /&gt;&lt;ref name=wdm /&gt; and included among the top 10 discoveries in science in 2011 by [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]].&lt;ref name=wired-top-discoveries /&gt; NECSI's scientific visualizations have received multiple citations on top 10 lists.&lt;ref name=wired-best-figures /&gt;&lt;ref name=wired-graphics /&gt;&lt;ref name=map-porn /&gt;

NECSI has been called "a pioneer in using mathematics, computation and other quantitative methods to analyse topics like ethnic violence, economic crises and healthcare systems" by the press.&lt;ref name="The Economic Times"/&gt;

The '''no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL)''' denotes the level of exposure of an [[organism]], found by [[experiment]] or [[observation]], at which there is no biologically or statistically [[Statistical significance|significant]] increase in the frequency or severity of any adverse effects (e.g. alteration of [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], functional capacity, [[Human development (biology)|growth]], development or life span) in the exposed population when compared to its appropriate control. In non-clinical assessment, NOAEL plays a pivotal role. It is determined or proposed by qualified personnel (pharmacologist or toxicologist) depending on the study, drug indications and its pharmacological therapeutics side/adverse effects. NOAEL could be defined as "the highest experimental point that is without adverse effect," meaning that under laboratory conditions, it is the level where there is no side-effects. It either does not provide the effects of drug with respect to duration and dose, or it does not address the interpretation of risk based on toxicologically relevant effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Engelhardt JA|first1=Dorato MA|title=The no-observed-adverse-effect-level in drug safety evaluations: Use, issues, and definition(s)|journal=Regul Toxicol Pharmacol|date=August 2005|volume=42|issue=3|pages=265–274|doi=10.1016/j.yrtph.2005.05.004|pmid=15979222}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To say detail the NOAEL does not describe the duration, dose, or risk involved and is therefore more of a threshold marker. This is also known as highest no-effect level, or HNEL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Marie |editor1-first=S. |editor2-last=Piggott | editor2-first=J.R. |date=July 2013| edition=1991 |title=Handbook of Sweeteners |url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781475753820 |access-date=February 5, 2018 |location=New York, New York, USA |publisher=Springer |page=279 |isbn= 978-1475753820 |archive-date=February 5, 2018 |archive-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UP2BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA279&amp;lpg=PA279&amp;dq=HNEL+highest+level&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=25JLOIE2H6&amp;sig=rUuML3qwEC_yMWOR1dodNxMCJ8I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUxZbRno_ZAhWHSBQKHW0jCo0Q6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=HNEL%20highest%20level&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[toxicology]] it is specifically the highest tested dose or concentration of a substance (i.e. a drug or chemical) or agent (e.g. radiation), at which no such adverse effect is found in exposed test organisms where higher doses or concentrations resulted in an adverse effect.&lt;ref name=Faustman&gt;Faustman, E.M., Omenn, G.S.

In drug development, NOAEL of a new drug is assessed in laboratory animals drugs prior to initiation of clinical trials to establish a safe clinical starting dose in human trials.

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] defines NOAEL as 'an exposure level at which there are no statistically or biologically significant increases in the frequency or severity of adverse effects between the exposed population and its appropriate control; some effects may be produced at this level, but they are not considered as adverse, or as precursors to adverse effects.&lt;ref name="pmid15979222" /&gt; In an experiment with several NOAELs, the regulatory focus is primarily on the highest one, leading to the common usage of the term NOAEL as the highest exposure without adverse effects.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/OCEPAterms/nterms.html|title=Terms &amp; Acronyms|first=EPA, OEI, SOR, System Of|last=Registries|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many adult orchids retain their fungal symbionts, although the benefits to the adult [[photosynthetic]] orchid and the fungus remain largely unexplored.

==Seed germination ==
[[File:Anacamptis fragrans.JPG|thumb|Orchid protocorm]]
Orchids have several life stages. The first stage is the non-germinated orchid seed, the next stage is the protocorm, and the following stage is the adult orchid. Orchid seeds are very small 0.35mm to 1.50mm long), spindle-shaped, and have an opening at the pointed end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arditti|first=Joseph|last2=Michaud|first2=Justine D.|last3=Healey|first3=Patrick L.|date=1979|title=Morphometry of Orchid Seeds.

In nature, the nutritional support comes from a fungal partner.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; When the orchid seeds geminate, they form seedling structures called protocorms which consist of [[parenchyma]] cells.&lt;ref name="Minasiewicz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterson" /&gt; Infected protocorms tend to develop an active meristem within a few days.&lt;ref name="Hadley"/&gt; In the adult stage, many orchids have a small amount of thick unbranched roots which results in a root system with a small surface area that is favorable to potentially mycotrophic tissue.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rasmussen|first=Hanne N.|last2=Whigham|first2=Dennis F.|date=2002-06-01|title=Phenology of roots and mycorrhiza in orchid species differing in phototrophic strategy|journal=New Phytologist|language=en|volume=154|issue=3|pages=797–807 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.2002.00422.x|issn=1469-8137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orchids lacking chlorophyll, called achlorophyllous MHPs, will retain their fungal symbionts their entire lives, relying on the fungus for carbon.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKendrick|first=S. L.|last2=Leake|first2=J. R.|last3=Taylor|first3=D. Lee|last4=Read|first4=D.

In 1922 the American botanist Lewis Knudson discovered that orchid seeds could be grown on agar and fungal sugars without mycorrhizae, however modern research has found that the germination of orchids may be more successful with the actual fungus.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alghamdi|first=Sameera A.|title=Influence of mycorrhizal fungi on seed germination and growth in terrestrial and epiphytic orchids|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1319562X1730270X|journal=Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences|doi=10.1016/j.sjbs.2017.10.021|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Epiphyte|epiphytic]] orchids grow on other plants they may produce chlorophyll in their leaves, stems, and roots. As with all orchids, germination and the develop into protocorms, young plants which have germinated but lack leaves, is reliant upon fungal symbionts, which decrease the time of germination and increase the vigor of the protocorm'''.'''&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The reliance of orchids on specific fungi has been widely studied, and the populations of certain fungi which are present in the soil have proved to be of greater importance in seed germination than the orchid's proximity to older plants or their geographical location, as previously assumed.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, M. K., Taylor, D. L., Whigham, D. F. and Burnett, R. K. (2016), Germination patterns in three terrestrial orchids relate to abundance of mycorrhizal fungi.

== Fungal entry into orchid ==
The fungus can enter at various orchid life stages. Fungal hyphae can penetrate the parenchyma cells of geminated orchid seeds, protocorms, late-staged seedlings, or adult plant roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Molecular mycorrhizal symbiosis |last=Martin |first=Francis |isbn=9781118951415|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|oclc=958205579|date=2016-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fungal hyphae that enter the orchid have many mitochondria and few vacuoles.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Peterson|first=R.

=== Fungal pelotons and orchid root cortex ===
Shortly after the fungus enters an orchid, the fungus produces intracellular hyphal coils, called pelotons, in the embryos of developing seedlings and the roots of adult plants.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; The formation of pelotons in root cortical cells is a defining anatomical structure in orchid mycorrhiza that differentiate it from other forms of mycorrhiza.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rasmussen|first=Hanne N.|date=2002|title=Recent developments in the study of orchid mycorrhiza|jstor=24130393|journal=Plant and Soil|volume=244|issue=1/2|pages=149–163|doi=10.2307/24130393|doi-broken-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pelotons can range in size and in the loose or tight packaging of their hyphae.&lt;ref name="Hadley"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hadley|first=G.|last2=Williamson|first2=B.|date=1971-05-01|title=Analysis of the Post-Infection Growth Stimulus in Orchid Mycorrhiza|journal=New Phytologist|language=en|volume=70|issue=3|pages=445–455|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1971.tb02546.x|issn=1469-8137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pelotons of live fungal hyphae are eventually disintegrated, or lysed, and become brown or yellow clumps in the orchid cells.&lt;ref name="Minasiewicz"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Selosse|first=Marc-André|last2=Minasiewicz|first2=Julita|last3=Boullard|first3=Bernard|date=2017-08-01|title=An annotated translation of Noël Bernard's 1899 article 'On the germination of Neottia nidus-avis'|journal=Mycorrhiza|language=en|volume=27|issue=6|pages=611–618|doi=10.1007/s00572-017-0774-z|pmid=28421312|issn=0940-6360}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disintegrated pelotons are an area of considerable interest in current research.

== Fungi forming orchid mycorrhizae ==
'''Basidiomycetous Rhizoctonia Fungi'''

The fungi that form orchid mycorrhizae are typically [[basidiomycetes]]. These fungi come from a range of taxa including ''[[Ceratobasidium]]'' ([[Rhizoctonia]]), ''[[Sebacina]]'', ''[[Tulasnella]]'' and ''[[Russula]]'' species. Most orchids associate with [[saprotrophic]] or [[pathogenic]] fungi, while a few associate with [[ectomycorrhizal]] fungal species. These latter associations are often called tripartite associations as they involve the orchid, the ectomycorrhizal fungus and its photosynthetic host plant. Some of the challenges in determining host-specificity in orchid mycorrhizae have been the methods of identifying the orchid-specific fungi from other free living fungal species in wild-sourced samples. Even with modern molecular analysis and genomic databases, this can still prove difficult,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;McCormick, M. K., Whigham, D. F. and O'Neill, J. (2004), Mycorrhizal diversity in photosynthetic terrestrial orchids. New Phytologist, 163: 425–438. doi:10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01114.x&lt;/ref&gt; partially due to the difficulty in culturing fungi from protocorms and identification of fungal samples,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; as well as changes in evolving rDNA.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacquemyn|first=Hans|last2=Honnay|first2=Olivier|last3=Cammue|first3=Bruno P.

'''Ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycota'''

A number of other basidiomycetous fungi have been documented in various orchids that do not fall under the Rhizoctonia umbrella. In particular, many fully mycoheterotrophic orchids associate with ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes belonging to genera such as Thelephora, Tomentella and Russula. 

'''Basidiomycetes of the Atractiellales'''

'''Ascomycota'''

Though rare in orchids, ascomycete associations have been documented in several orchid species. The European terrestrial orchid Epipactis helleborine has a specific association with ectomycorrhizal ascomycetes in the Tuberaceae.

== Symbiont specificity ==
Current molecular analysis has allowed for the identification of specific taxa forming symbiotic relationships which are of interest in the study, cultivation, and conservation of orchids. This is especially important in the trade and preservation endangered species or orchids of commercial value like the [[vanilla bean]].&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swarts|first=Nigel D.|last2=Dixon|first2=Kingsley W.|title=Perspectives on orchid conservation in botanic gardens|journal=Trends in Plant Science|language=en-US|volume=14|issue=11|pages=590–598|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2009.07.008|pmid=19733499|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been seen trends in the type of symbioses found in orchids, depending primarily on the life-style of the orchid, as the symbiosis is primarily of benefit to the plant. Terrestrial orchids have been found to commonly associate with [[Tulasnellaceae]], however some [[autotroph]]ic and non-autotrophic orchids do associate with several ectomycorrhizal fungi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bidartondo|first=Martin I. |last2=Burghardt|first2=Bastian |last3=Gebauer|first3=Gerhard |last4=Bruns|first4=Thomas D.|last5=Read|first5=David J.|date=2004|title=Changing Partners in the Dark: Isotopic and Molecular Evidence of Ectomycorrhizal Liaisons between Forest Orchids and Trees |jstor=4142864|journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences|volume=271|issue=1550|pages=1799–1806}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKendrick|first=S.

Using this technique seeds of the epiphytic orchid ''[[Dendrobium aphyllum]]'' were  found to germinate to seedlings when paired with fungal strains of ''Tulasnella'',  however, seeds of this species did not germinate when treated with ''[[Trichoderma]]'' fungi taken from adult orchids, indicating there are stage specific symbionts. These fungal symbioses, as well as their affinity towards  specific symbionts, vary based on the stage of development and age of the host roots&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zi|first=Xiao-Meng|last2=Sheng|first2=Chun-Ling|last3=Goodale|first3=Uromi Manage|last4=Shao|first4=Shi-Cheng|last5=Gao|first5=Jiang-Yun|date=2014-10-01|title=In situ seed baiting to isolate germination-enhancing fungi for an epiphytic orchid, Dendrobium aphyllum (Orchidaceae)|journal=Mycorrhiza|language=en|volume=24|issue=7|pages=487–499|doi=10.1007/s00572-014-0565-8 |pmid=24563211|issn=0940-6360}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  As an orchid ages the fungal associations become more complex.

[[Mixotroph]]ic orchids like ''Cephalanthera longibracteata''  may associate generally with several fungi, most notably from ''[[Russulaceae]],[[Tricholomataceae]], [[Sebacinales]], [[Thelephoraceae]].'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sakamoto |first=Yuki |last2=Yokoyama |first2=Jun |last3=Maki |first3=Masayuki |title=Mycorrhizal diversity of the orchid Cephalanthera longibracteata in Japan |journal=Mycoscience |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=183–189 |doi=10.1016/j.myc.2014.06.002|year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as they do not depend as heavily on the fungus for carbon. Some orchids can be very specific in their symbionts, preferring a single class or genus of fungi.  Genotypes of ''[[Corallorhiza maculata]],'' a [[Myco-heterotrophy|myco-heterotrophic]] orchid, have been found to closely associate with ''Russulaceae'' regardless of geological location or the presence of other orchids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=D.

The environment may also affect the fungal symbiosis, with differences in tropical versus temperate orchids. The photosynthetic orchid ''[[Goodyera pubescens]]'' was found to associate with only one dominate fungus, unless subjected to changes in the environment, like drought, in which case the orchid was able to change symbionts in response to stresses.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McCormick |first=Melissa K. |last2=Whigham |first2=Dennis F. |last3=Sloan |first3=Dan |last4=O'Malley |first4=Kelly |last5=Hodkinson |first5=Brendan |date=2006-04-01 |title=Orchid–Fungus Fidelity: A Marriage Meant to Last? |journal=Ecology |language=en |volume=87 |issue=4 |pages=903–911 |doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[903:ofammt]2.0.co;2 |issn=1939-9170}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is unique in that it conflicts with the trends seen in most [[Arbuscular mycorrhiza|arbuscular]] and ectomycorrhizal symbioses which form associations with several fungi at the same time.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt;

The knowledge of species-specific fungal symbionts is crucial given the endangered status of many orchids around the world. The identification of their fungal symbionts could prove useful in the preservation and reintroduction of threatened orchids.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Researchers in India have used samples from adult orchids to germinate seeds from an endangered orchid ''[[Dactylorhiza hatagirea]]'' which were found to associate closely with ''[[Ceratobasidium]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aggarwal, Simmi|first=Zettler, Lawrence W.|date=2010|title=Reintroduction of an endangered terrestrial orchid, Dactylorhiza hatagirea (D.

==Biography==

[[File:Anglo-Flemish School, Arthur, Prince of Wales (Granard portrait) -003.png|thumb|right|upright|Portrait of [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]] (1486–1502) reidentified by Mould]]

Mould was educated at [[Kingsmead School, Hoylake]], [[Worth School]] and the [[University of East Anglia]] from where he graduated with a BA in History of Art in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;'MOULD, Philip Jonathan Clifford', Who's Who 2014, A &amp; C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Mould's father owned a factory in Liverpool and his family was based in the Wirral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/my-perfect-weekend/10560561/My-perfect-weekend-Philip-Mould-art-sleuth.html|title=My perfect weekend: Philip Mould, art sleuth|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed an interest in antiques at an early age, thanks to his mother. She contracted polio as a child, and was in a wheelchair so would send Philip, aged six, into antiques shops to bring things out to her for inspection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3827475/I-sold-signed-copy-John-Lennon-s-Mind-Games-50p-Philip-Mould-gives-definitive-answers-probing-questions.html|title=The definite article: This week it’s host Philip Mould|newspaper=Mail Online|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mould made friends with the owner of a local antiques shop, who taught him to read hallmarks on silver when he was just 11 or 12 years old, and by the age of 14 he was dealing in antique silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/my-perfect-weekend/10560561/My-perfect-weekend-Philip-Mould-art-sleuth.html|title=My perfect weekend: Philip Mould, art sleuth|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mould is a regular broadcaster, reviewer and writer for the national press.  His television work includes writing and presenting the [[Channel 4]] series ''Changing Faces,'' and featuring as an expert on the ''[[Antiques Roadshow]].'' In 2011, he began co-hosting the television programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' with [[Fiona Bruce]].&lt;ref name="FoF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mxxz6|title=Fake or Fortune?|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fake or Fortune?'' now ranks as television's most popular arts show - regularly drawing an audience of 5 million - and has an international following.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/its-a-copy-fake-or-fortune-stars-try-to-halt-rival-show-6gstpwtrz|title=It’s a copy: Fake or Fortune? stars try to halt rival show|access-date=2017-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, Mould warned of the increasing prevalence of what he termed "trapping" in which crooked sellers misleadingly hint that fake artworks have genuine provenance, without actually making false descriptions or asserting attributions.&lt;ref name="Copping"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/10566055/Art-experts-warn-of-the-rise-of-the-trappers.html|title=Art experts warn of the rise of the 'trappers'|last=Copping|first=Jasper|date=12 January 2014|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mould is the author of two critically acclaimed books on art discovery, which are frequently cited as illuminating and well told insights into the workings of the old master trade, and have been published in America, Japan and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/5567418/Sleuth-The-Amazing-Quest-for-Lost-Art-Treasures-by-Philip-Mould-review.html|title=Sleuth: The Amazing Quest for Lost Art Treasures by Philip Mould: review|last=Reid|first=By Aileen|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of his art world expertise and contribution to portrait heritage he was created [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in the [[2005 New Year Honours]] list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/news/nyhons05.htm |title=The British Theatre Guide: New Year Honours List 2005 |publisher=Britishtheatreguide.info |date=4 January 2005 |accessdate=6 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050122024515/http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/news/nyhons05.htm |archivedate=22 January 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his achievements in his field, as well as his involvement with numerous charities and broadcasting, Mould received an [[honorary doctorate]] in July 2013 at his [[Alma mater|former university]], the [[University of East Anglia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/2013/May/hon-grads|title=UEA to honour notable alumni at its 50th anniversary graduation|date=21 May 2013|publisher=University of East Anglia|accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, Mould was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'' opposing [[Scottish independence]] in the run-up to September's [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|referendum on that issue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/07/celebrities-open-letter-scotland-independence-full-text |title=Celebrities' open letter to Scotland – full text and list of signatories &amp;#124; Politics |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2014-08-07 |accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015 Mould appeared on BBC's ''[[Gardeners' World]]'', in the garden of his home, discussing his passion for nature and talked of his interest in varieties of rose which would have been grown in the time of [[Anthony van Dyck|Sir Anthony van Dyck]]. He also discussed the work of one of his favourite artists, [[Cedric Morris]], who was also a great [[plantsman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06h3zs2 |title=BBC Two - Gardeners' World, 2015, Episode 29 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=9 October 2015 |accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mould is a keen collector of Morris's work (for his private collection), and champions modern British artists in general; he cites the [[Bloomsbury Group]] amongst his favourites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/my-perfect-weekend/10560561/My-perfect-weekend-Philip-Mould-art-sleuth.html|title=My perfect weekend: Philip Mould, art sleuth|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate Influence ==
Climate change is the main force behind changes in species distribution and abundance. Repeated changes in climate throughout the [[Quaternary]] Period are thought to have had a significant impact on the current vegetative species diversity present today.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, K.D., 1988, Post-glacial vegetation history: ecological considerations, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Handbook of Vegetation science, vol.7, pp.699-724&lt;/ref&gt; Functional and [[phylogenetic]] diversity are considered to be closely related to changing climatic conditions, this indicates that trait differences are extremely important in long term responses to climate change. During the transition from the last glaciation of the [[Pleistocene]] to the [[Holocene period]], climate warming resulted in the expansion of taller plants and larger seed bearing plants which resulted in lower proportions of vegetative regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;Reitalu, T., Gerhold, P., Poska, A., Pärtel, M., Väli, V., Veski, S. (2015), Novel insights into post-glacial vegetation change: functional and phylogenetic diversity in pollen records. Journal of Vegetation Science, v. 26, p. 911–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, low temperatures can be strong environmental filters that prevent tall and large-seeded plants from establishing in postglacial environments.&lt;ref&gt;Reitalu, T., Gerhold, P., Poska, A., Pärtel, M., Väli, V., Veski, S. (2015), Novel insights into post-glacial vegetation change: functional and phylogenetic diversity in pollen records. Journal of Vegetation Science, v. 26, p. 911–22.&lt;/ref&gt;
Throughout Europe vegetation dynamics within the first half of the Holocene appear to have been influenced mainly by climate and the reorganization of atmospheric circulation associated with the disappearance of the North American ice sheet. This is evident in the rapid increase of forestation and changing biomes during the postglacial period between 11500ka and 8000ka before the present.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, B., Collins, P.M., Kaplan, J.O., 2014 (July), The age and post-glacial development of the modern European vegetation: a plant functional approach based on pollen data, Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg, DOI 10.1007/s00334-014-0476-9&lt;/ref&gt;
Vegetation development periods of post-glacial land forms on [[Ellesmere Island]], Northern Canada, is assumed to have been at least ca. 20,000 years in duration. This slow progression is mostly due to climatic restrictions such as an estimated annual rainfall amount of only 64mm and a mean annual temperature of -19.7 degrees Celsius. The length in time of vegetation development observed on Ellesmere Island is evidence that post glacial vegetation development is much more restricted in the Arctic and colder climates as compared to milder climatic regions such as the boreal, temperate and tropical zones.&lt;ref&gt;Okitsu, S., Sawaguchi, S., Hasegawa, H., Kanda, H., 2004, Vegetation development on the glacier  moraines in Oobloyah Valley, Ellesmere Island, high arctic Canada, National Institute of Polar Research, Polar Biosci., 17, 83-94&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vegetation Responses ==
As land became exposed following the glaciation of the last ice age, a variety of geographic settings ranging from the tropics to the Arctic and Antarctic became available for the establishment of vegetation. Species that now exist on formerly glaciated terrain must have undergone a change in distribution of hundreds to thousands of kilometers, or have evolved from other [[taxa]] that have once done so in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, K.D., 1988, Post-glacial vegetation history: ecological considerations, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Handbook of Vegetation science, vol.7, pp.699-724&lt;/ref&gt; In a newly developing environment, plant growth is often strongly influenced by the introduction of new organisms into that environment, where competitive or mutuallistic relationships may develop. Often, competitive balances are eventually reached and species abundances remain somewhat constant over a period of generations. 
Studies done on the Norwegian Island of [[Svalbard]], have been very useful in understanding the behavior of postglacial vegetation. Studies show that many vascular plants that are considered pioneers of vegetation development, eventually become less frequent. For example, the abundance of species such as [[Braya purpurascens]] has fallen nearly 30% due to the introduction of new species in the area.&lt;ref&gt;5. Moreau, M., Laffly, D. and Brossard, T. (2009), Recent spatial development of Svalbard strandflat vegetation over a period of 31 years. Polar Research, v. 28, p. 364–375.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Postglacial Vegetation in North America ==
Arctic vegetation has distinct postglacial development characteristics compared to more temperate zones of lower latitudes. A study of postglacial moraines conducted in the Canadian Arctic on Ellesmere Island have found that dwarf shrubs of Dryas integrifolia and Cassiope tetragona are often good indicators of vegetation development and progression. Dwarf shrubs have been found to increase with the age of the moraine, with Dryas integrifolia becoming the most predominant. As well the cover of vegetation, including lichens and [[bryophytes]] showed consistent increase with the moraine age, suggesting directional vegetation development.&lt;ref&gt;Okitsu, S., Sawaguchi, S., Hasegawa, H., Kanda, H., 2004, Vegetation development on the glacier  moraines in Oobloyah Valley, Ellesmere Island, high arctic Canada, National Institute of Polar Research, Polar Biosci., 17, 83-94&lt;/ref&gt; It is also suggested that part of the high proportions of polypoids occurring in arctic floras is the result of speciation as continental ice-sheets withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, K.D., 1988, Post-glacial vegetation history: ecological considerations, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Handbook of Vegetation science, vol.7, pp.699-724&lt;/ref&gt;
Pollen diagrams from northern Quebec, Canada, show advances throughout the Holocene of post-glacial vegetation development. The initial phase of open vegetation began about 6000 years before the present. Following deglaciation, shrub and herbaceous tundra plants dominated for a brief period of time. Plants such as the Larix laricina, Populus and [[Juniperus]], were also important in the initial vegetation development. Some species that followed later include: Alnus crispa, and [[Betula]]. Though later vegetation development was mainly dominated by [[Picea]], shortly following deglaciation, they reached their present day limit. Today black spruce is mainly dominant throughout much of northern Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;Gawjewski, Konrad., Garralla, Silvina., and Milot-roy, Valerie., Postglacial vegetation at the Northern Limit of Lichen Woodland in Northwestern Quebec, 1996, Geographie Physique et Quarternaire, v 50(3). P. 341-350&lt;/ref&gt;
Continental U.S. is considered to have strongly contributed to the re-establishment of postglacial vegetation in Canada following the last ice age. Roughly 300 taxa of vascular plants and mosses that were found to have existed below the extent of the last glacial period within the United States are also found to have migrated to Canada. These patterns are recorded within either pollen or macro fossils.&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, J.C.,1987, Postglacial Vegetation of Canada, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521544092}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anthropogenic Impact ==
Studies done by Reitalu, (2015) have found that human impact throughout much of Europe has negatively influenced plant diversity by suppressing the establishment of tall-growing, large seeded taxa. Although human influence has facilitated many Ruderal species, this is believed to have led to an overall decrease in phylogenetic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Reitalu, T., Gerhold, P., Poska, A., Pärtel, M., Väli, V., Veski, S. (2015), Novel insights into post-glacial vegetation change: functional and phylogenetic diversity in pollen records. Journal of Vegetation Science, v. 26, p. 911–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Methods ==
Many pollen diagrams around the world indicate that major climate changes caused the last continental ice sheets to retreat, leading to dramatic effects on the distribution and abundance of plants.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, K.D., 1988, Post-glacial vegetation history: ecological considerations, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Handbook of Vegetation science, vol.7, pp.699-724&lt;/ref&gt; By converting pollen data into plant functional type (PFT) assemblages and interpolating the data, researchers have been able to reconstruct postglacial vegetation patterns around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, B., Collins, P.M., Kaplan, J.O., 2014 (July), The age and post-glacial development of the modern European vegetation: a plant functional approach based on pollen data, Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg, DOI 10.1007/s00334-014-0476-9&lt;/ref&gt; Core sampling and analysis of lake sediments that contain pollen and other plant remains are often used to obtain good records of past pollination cycles. Such paleorecords preserved in lake sediments can be used to reconstruct the history of post glacial vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Seppä, H., Cwynar, L. C. and MacDonald, G. M.

''' Preparation ''' is a management principle whereby people get ready for a final product or for a successful experience. Preparation means "a substance especially prepared".&lt;ref name=OnlineEty&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=preparation |title=preparation |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2014|website=Online Etymology Dictionary  |publisher=Douglas Harper |accessdate=2014-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preparation is a proceeding or readiness for a future event as a goal and an acceptable accomplished final outcome.&lt;ref name=OnlineDictionary/&gt; It is to make something (''e.g.'', child, food, procedures, machines) acceptable before you give it to others.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=6}}

== Etymology ==

The word "preparation" comes from late Middle English (1350–1400): via Old French from Latin praeparationem ''praeparatio(n-)'' "a making ready". It is from a past participle stem of ''praeparāre'' meaning to prepare; from prae "before" + parare "make ready".{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=6}} The word "prepare" means to put in proper readiness beforehand and has a relationship to the word "parent."&lt;ref name=OnlineDictionary&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Preparation+?s=t |title=preparation |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |website= |publisher=Dictionary.Com |accessdate=2014-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==

The concept of preparation is where one prepares (makes ready) for something. An example of a preparatory process is when a high school student prepares for a [[higher education]] by taking the appropriate [[college prep]] courses. High school students can also take certain courses that will enable them to be prepared for the work force upon graduation.{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|pp=6–11}} Certain school courses teach preparation for choosing a career.{{sfn|Baker|2005|pp=299–333}}
The discipline of old-school step-by-step meticulous preparing as getting ready for something leads to ultimate accomplishment.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=1}}

== Checklist ==
Preparation is preparing and getting ready materials and equipment before an event takes place.{{sfn| Cialdini|2010|p=71}}{{sfn| Klein|2004|pp=34–37}}{{sfn| Kyriacou|1998|p=16}} Many times a [[checklist]] is the result of someone not doing the proper beforehand steps needed before a major event is to occur (''i.e.'', [[Takeoff|airplane takeoff]], [[medical procedure]]) and later disastrous results happen because of this lack of preparedness.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=4}} Meetings should involve people being first notified so they can do preparation ahead of the meeting time.{{sfn|Gates|2009|p=20}}

Preparation involves a fact-finding mission in getting a qualified person for a position in a company. This includes not only the characteristics of the potential new employee but the parameters of a particular company including its policies and dynamics.{{sfn|Khurana|2011|pp=134–5}} The person as a business partner should know how to solve problems, create opportunities, and use the company’s strengths in a strategic way.{{sfn| Gilley|2007|pp=186–9}} Organizations involved in teaching must prepare new knowledge to teach individuals to grow. This preparation of new information and teaching self-motivation then involves forming knowledge acquisition plans.{{sfn|Gilley|2000|pp=130–9}} [[On the job training]] engages people in activities that are practical in preparation for an improvement in their career skills. To get an individual self-motivated one should be taught how certain information and preparation of specific skills will benefit them personally. A method of preparation is when a manager will explain what is expected as an end result and some possible ways to accomplish that and get the employee engaged in real life situations.{{sfn|Buckingham|2005|pp=121–2}}

== System ==
[[File:WikiPreparation.jpg|thumb|Wikipedian preparing for a new article]]
Having a well defined ''preparation system'' will increase one's chances of becoming a strong competitor.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=36}} Preparation is to harness your passion of something with a system of developing steps to accomplish a good outcome.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=19}} 
For example, Wikipedians do certain steps in preparing to create a new article.{{sfn|Ayers|Matthews|Yates|2008|p=162}} Preparation is used in business transactions and management.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=4}} Professionals in all fields that achieve their goals are masters at preparing and putting their ducks in a row.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=10}}

Many times an important part of preparation is the concept that [[time is of the essence]] and applies especially to [[contract law]].{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=5}} Preparation allows time needed to do the right steps sequentially in the correct order, instead of panicking and doing quick steps haphazardly with no thought has to what should come first and what should come next.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=5}} Preparation time gives better results as a conclusion where one can achieve what's desired.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=5}} Avoiding proper preparation through scheming short-cuts in the long run doesn't pay and will give unwanted results.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|pp=22–25}}

== Beforehand planning ==
The concept of "preparation" has a [[Venn diagram|Venn relationship]] with the concept of "planning"; the two concepts are separate but closely intertwined.{{sfn|Harnack|Story |1998|pp=995–1000}} In scholarly use, the concept of "planning" is often associated with long-tailed, open-ended processes of chronological foresight, while the concept of "preparation" is more closely tied to immediate steps taken to achieve a tangible, closed-ended goal.{{sfn|Harnack|Story |1998|pp=995–1000}} For example, a dietician may counsel her clients on the elements of meal "planning," and after internalizing this training the client may utilize his meal-planning skills in the immediate task of preparing a meal.{{sfn|Harnack|Story |1998|pp=995–1000}} In business use, "planning" is a management principle to set up details to achieve a goal,&lt;ref name=Bplanning&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/planning.html |title=planning |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |website=BusinessDictionary.com |publisher= WebFinance, Inc.|accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the concept of "preparation" is tied to contemplation of a future event by making something ready now.&lt;ref name=Bpreparation&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/preparation.html |title=preparation |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |website=BusinessDictionary.com |publisher= WebFinance, Inc.|accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example here would be [[merchandising]] where the preparation is the buying of the merchandise and getting it ready in the storage area and the planning is the goal of getting the merchandise shelved and sold to the customer to make a profit.&lt;ref name=merchandising&gt;{{cite web |url= http://yourbusiness.azcentral.com/differences-between-merchandising-stocking-12561.html |title=The Differences Between Merchandising &amp; Stocking |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=azcentral |publisher=Gannett Company |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[salesmanship]] use, "planning" is the principle to set up a strategy (''i.e.'', techniques) to [[Closing (sales)|close the sale]], while the concept of "preparation" is tied to contemplation of the completion of the sale and [[Guided selling|making ready now]] the assumption that it will happen.{{sfn|Bettger|2009|pp=40–55}} An example here is the preparation to ask questions to find out the customer's needs so that [[Solution selling|the plan to close the sale]] will happen.{{sfn|Bettger|2009|pp=40–55}}

[[Benjamin Disraeli]]'s viewpoint on preparation was that the secret of success in life is when a person is ready for his once in a lifetime opportunity.{{sfn|Maxwell|1998|p=29}} [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s viewpoint was that politics is a profession for which no preparation is necessary.{{sfn|Lederer|2007|p=32}} GM’s [[Alfred Sloan]] believes that with the preparation of sound facts that sound policies can be put into place.{{sfn|Gates|2009|p=20}} [[Sun Tzu]]'s philosophy on war was ''he will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared.''&lt;ref name=suntzusaid&gt;{{cite web |url= http://suntzusaid.com/book/3 |title=Attack by Stratagem  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |website=Sun Tzu's Art of War |publisher=John Watson, LLC |accessdate=2014-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12643">'''Pyknon''', {{lang-el|πυκνόν}}, sometimes also transliterated as '''pycnon''' (from {{lang-el|πυκνός}} close, close-packed, crowded, condensed; {{lang-lat|spissus}}) in the music theory of Antiquity is a structural property of any [[tetrachord]] in which a composite of two smaller intervals is less than the remaining ([[incomposite interval|incomposite]]) interval. The makeup of the ''pyknon'' serves to identify the [[Genus (music)|melodic genus]] (also called "genus of a tetrachord") and the [[octave species]] made by compounding two such tetrachords, and the rules governing the ways in which such compounds may be made centre on the relationships of the two ''pykna'' involved.

==Definition==
The ''pyknon'' was an important criterion in the classification of melodic genera ({{lang-el|γένη τῶν μελῳδουμένων}}). The Greek word πυκνόν is an adjective meaning "close", "compact", "close-packed", or "crowded" {{harv|Liddell and Scott|1996}}. In Ancient Greek music theory, this term is used to describe a pair of intervals within a [[tetrachord]], the sum of which is less than the remainder of the tetrachord {{harv|Levin|2007|loc=413}}. Although in modern usage, a tetrachord may be ''any'' four-note segment of a [[musical scale|scale]], or indeed any (unordered) collection of four [[pitch class]]es, in ancient Greek music theory a tetrachord consists of a four-note segment of the [[Musical system of ancient Greece#Syst.C3.AAma Ametabolon.2C an overview of the tone system|Greater and Lesser Perfect Systems]] bounded by the interval of a perfect fourth, the outer notes of which remain fixed in all genera and therefore are called "standing notes" ({{lang-el|ἑστῶτες φθόγγοι}}). The positions of the inner notes vary from one genus to another, for which reason they are called "movable notes" ({{harvnb|Mathiesen|1999|loc=301, 312, 322, 344, 350, et passim}}; from {{lang-el|κινούμενοι φθόγγοι}}). In its basic theoretical form, the largest interval of a tetrachord is at the top, and the smallest at the bottom. The existence of a ''pyknon'' therefore depends on the uppermost interval being larger than half of a perfect fourth, which occurs only in the [[Chromatic genus|chromatic]] and [[Enharmonic genus|enharmonic genera]]. Because the [[diatonic genus]] consists of two whole tones and one semitone, no single interval is larger than the other two combined, and so there is no ''pyknon'' {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=229}}. For this reason, the enharmonic and chromatic genera are sometimes called the "pyknic genera", in order to distinguish them from the diatonic {{harv|Solomon|1984|loc=246}}.

==Theoretical applications==
The notes of the central tetrachord of the system in ascending order are ''hypate'', ''parhypate'', ''lichanos'' (or ''hypermese''), and ''mese''. A second tetrachord is added above, after a disjunctive tone, and the corresponding names (together with the interval ratios of the standing tones) are ({{harvnb|Chalmers|1990|loc=4}}; {{harvnb|Mathiesen|1999|loc=245}}):
*''mese'' (4:3) – ''nete'' (2:1) (standing)
*''lichanos'' – ''paranete'' (movable)
*''parhypate'' – ''trite'' (movable)
*''hypate'' (1:1) – ''paramese'' (3:2) (standing)
Although movable, the ''lichanos'' must remain above the ''parhypate'', and the ''paranete'' above the ''trite'' {{harv|Mathiesen|1999|loc=312}}.

A "composite interval" is one made up of two or more smaller intervals; an "incomposite interval" has no smaller components In these terms, if the composite interval between the ''hypate'' and the ''lichanos'' (or ''paramese'' and ''paranete'') is smaller than the incomposite interval from the ''lichanos'' to the ''mese'' (or ''paranete'' to ''nete''), the three notes in that composite interval are together called a ''pyknon'' {{harv|Mathiesen|1999|loc=312}}. In the diatonic genus, because the composite interval from ''hypate'' to ''lichanos'' (a minor third) is larger than the remaining incomposite interval from ''lichanos'' to ''mese'' (a whole tone), the lowest three notes of the diatonic tetrachord are designated ''apyknon'': "not close-packed" {{harv|Barbera|1977|loc=321n11}}.

==Enharmonic==
[[File:Greek Dorian enharmonic genus.png|thumb|right|300px|Two pyknic enharmonic tetrachords, together comprising the Greek [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] [[octave species]] in the enharmonic genus]]
In the enharmonic genus, the large incomposite interval was originally a [[ditone]] (the [[major third]] of [[Pythagorean tuning]]), leaving a ''pyknon'' with a total width of just a [[semitone]]. The Pythagorean ditone is equivalent to two 9:8 ''epogdoa'', or [[major second]]s), together an interval of 81:64, thus leaving a ''pyknon'' of 256:243—a [[Pythagorean limma#Pythagorean tuning|limma]] (minor Pythagorean semitone), but how the ''pyknon'' was exactly (that is by exact mathematic calculation) divided into its two component intervals is not known {{harv|Chalmers|1990|loc=9}}. The tuning of [[Eratosthenes]], as reported by [[Aristoxenus]], uses a major third of 19:15 with the two unequal intervals of the ''pyknon'' in the ratios of 40:39 and 39:38 {{harv|Chalmers|1990|loc=8}}. Although Aristoxenus also implies that the two intervals of the ''pyknon'' in the enharmonic genus may be equal {{harv|Mathiesen|1999|loc=333}}, the anonymous author of the Euclidean ''Sectio Canonis'' (P18) is unequivocal: "The ''parhypatai'' and ''tritai'' do not divide the ''pyknon'' into equal intervals" {{harv|Barker|1981|loc=6}}.

[[Ptolemy]] reports in his ''Harmonics'' (2. 14) that two other theorists, [[Archytas]] and [[Didymus the musician|Didymus]], replaced the ditone with the smaller, [[Just tuning|just]] major third with the number ratio of 5:4, making the ''pyknon'' correspondingly larger {{harv|West|1992|loc=170}}. This ''pyknon'' was divided differently by these two theorists, but in both cases the two intervals were not equal to one another. Archytas, who was the first theorist to give ratios for all of the genera, chose 28:27 and 36:35, and Didymus, some four centuries later, gave 32:31 and 31:30 {{harv|Chalmers|1990|loc=7–8}}.

In the chromatic genus, the largest interval was called a {{lang-el|τριημιτόνιόν ἀσύνθετον}}, {{lang-lat|triemitonium incompositum}}—translated as "incomposite" (or "noncomposite") "trihemitone" ({{harvnb|Bower|1989|loc=43}}; {{harvnb|Hagel|2009|loc=105, 266, 267}}; {{harvnb|Levin|1994|loc=125, 174}}; {{harvnb|Barker|1989|loc=261, 267}}, prefers a descriptive translation, "an individed interval of three semitones"; {{harvnb|Strunk|1998|loc=36, 37}} uses "trisemitone"), the modern term being "[[minor third]]"—leaving a ''pyknon'' of some type of whole tone to be divided into two semitones. There is a larger number of variations in the tuning of the chromatic than in the enharmonic. Up to the beginning of the 4th century BC the chromatic ''pyknon'' spanned a major whole tone with a 9:8 ratio, and this was divided by Gaudentius into ascending semitone intervals of 256:243 and  2187:2048 {{harv|Chalmers|1990|loc=8}}. Ptolemy defined two different tunings of the chromatic genus: the "soft" chromatic with a smaller ''pyknon'' and the "intense" chromatic with a larger one. The unequal semitones dividing the ''pykna'' were in ratios of 28:27 and 15:14 for the soft chromatic and 22:21 and 12:11 for the intense. The larger remaining interval was 6:5 in the soft chromatic and 7:6 in the intense {{harv|Chalmers|1990|loc=9}}.

==Scale structure==
[[File:Mixolydian chromatic.png|thumb|right|300px|Greek [[Mixolydian mode|Mixolydian]] octave species on E in the chromatic genus: conjunct tetrachords ''a'' and ''b'', with note of conjunction ''c'', and interval of disjunction ''d''; the two ''pykna'' are separated by the larger interval between steps 3 and 4 {{audio|Greek Mixolydian mode on E, chromatic genus.mid|Play}}]]
A further refinement of tetrachordal construction, according to Aristoxenus, is that the lower interval of the ''pyknon'' must be smaller than or equal to the upper one {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=229–30}}. Didymus in the chromatic genus and Archytas in the enharmonic broke this rule, however, and in the ''Harmonics'' (2. 13) Ptolemy criticized this feature in Didymus, holding that it is unmelodic and out of agreement with the evidence of our ears {{harv|West|1992|loc=170}}.

According to Aristoxenus (''Elements of Harmony'', book 2), whenever tetrachords are combined to form a scale filling an octave, "Two consecutive pycna may not occur in ascent or descent. A ditone may precede or follow [a pycnon] in ascent or descent. A tone may follow [a pycnon] only in descent" {{harv|Mathiesen|1999|loc=331}}.

{{Other uses|Quadrature (disambiguation)}}

In [[spherical astronomy]], '''quadrature''' is the configuration of a [[celestial object]] in which its [[elongation (astronomy)|elongation]] is [[perpendicular]] to the direction of the [[Sun]]. It is applied especially to the position of a [[superior planet]] or the [[Moon]] at its first and last quarter [[phases of the Moon|phases]].

As shown in the diagram above, a planet (or other object) can be at the western quadrature (when it is to the west of the Sun when viewed from the Earth) or at the eastern quadrature (when it is to the east of the Sun when viewed from the Earth). Note that an [[inferior planet]] can never be at quadrature to the reference planet.

The '''right to the city''' is an idea and a slogan that was first proposed by [[Henri Lefebvre]] in his 1968 book ''Le Droit à la ville'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Purcell | first = Mark | title = Excavating Lefebvre: The right to the city and its urban politics of the inhabitant | journal = [[GeoJournal]], special issue: Social Transformation, Citizenship, and the Right to the City | volume = 58 | issue = 2-3 | pages = 99–108 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1023/B:GEJO.0000010829.62237.8f | jstor = 41147756 | date = October 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:GEJO.0000010829.62237.8f3 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://faculty.washington.edu/mpurcell/geojournal.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Unger | first = Knut | title =  "Right to the City" as a response to the crisis: "Convergence" or divergence of urban social movements? | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120310001029/http://www.reclaiming-spaces.org/crisis/archives/266 | archive-date = 10 March 2012 | url = http://www.reclaiming-spaces.org/crisis/archives/266 | publisher = Reclaiming Spaces | date = 14 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that has been reclaimed more recently by social movements, thinkers and several progressive local authorities alike as a call to action to reclaim the city as a co-created space—a place for life detached from the growing effects that [[commodification]] and [[capitalism]] has had over social interaction and the rise of [[Spatial inequality|spatial inequalities]] in worldwide cities throughout the last two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newleftreview.org/II/53/david-harvey-the-right-to-the-city|title=David Harvey: The Right to the City. New Left Review 53, September-October 2008.|website=newleftreview.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first inception of the concept, Lefevbre paid specific emphasis on the effects that capitalism had over “the city”, whereas urban life was downgraded into a commodity, social interaction became increasingly uprooted and urban space and governance were turned into exclusive goods.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://capitanswing.com/libros/el-derecho-a-la-ciudad/|title=El derecho a la ciudad  {{!}}  Capitán Swing|last=Swing|first=Capitán|website=capitanswing.com|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition to this trend, Lefevbre called to “''rescue the citizen as main element and protagonist of the city that he himself had built''” and to transform urban space into “''a meeting point for building collective life''”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Due to the inequalities produced by the rapid increase of world urban population in most regions of the world, the concept of the right to the city has been recalled on several occasions since the publication of Lefevbre’s book as a call to action by social movements and grassroots organizations. In their appeal for “their right to the city”, local mobilizations around the world usually refer to their struggle for social justice and a dignified access to urban life face to growing urban inequalities (especially in large metropolitan concepts). The right to the city has had a particular influence in [[Latin America]] and [[Europe]], where social movements have particularly appealed to the concept in their actions and promoted local instruments for advancing its concrete understanding in terms of policy-making at the local and even national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/observatory/reports/competitive-metropolises-and-prospects-spatial-justice|title=Competitive Metropolises and the Prospects for Spatial Justice {{!}} CISDP|website=www.uclg-cisdp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rioonwatch.org/?p=11668|title=What Is The Right to the City? {{!}} RioOnWatch|website=www.rioonwatch.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good proof on how the notion of right to the city has gained international recognition in the last years could be seen in the [[United Nations]] [[Habitat III]] process, and how the [[New Urban Agenda]] (2016) recognized the concept as the vision of “cities for all”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/20/habitat-3-right-city-concrete-policies-ada-colau|title=After Habitat III: a stronger urban future must be based on the right to the city|last=Colau|first=Ada|date=2016-10-20|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing popularity of the concept has nonetheless raised some criticism and concerns on how the original vision of Henri Lefevbre could be reduced to a “citizenship vision”, focused on the mere implementation of social and economic rights in the city leaving aside its transformatory nature and the concept of social conflict behind the original concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/03/16/seres_urbanos/1521194122_492095.html|title=Elogio y rescate de Henri Lefebvre|last=Delgado|first=Manuel|date=2018-03-19|work=El País|access-date=2018-06-14|language=es|issn=1134-6582}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Gorgens | first1 = Tristan | last2 = van Donk | first2 = Mirjam | title = From basic needs towards socio-spatial transformation: coming to grips with the 'Right to the City' for the urban poor in South Africa | url = http://isandla.org.za/publications/152/ | website = isandla.org.za | publisher = The Isandla Institute | date = 2011 }} [http://isandla.org.za/download/assets/gorgens_and_van_donk_isandla_institute_acc-cubes_conference_paper.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcelo Lopes de Souza]] has for instance argued that as the right to the city has become "''fashionable these days''", "''the price of this has often been the trivialisation and corruption of Lefebvre's concept''"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lopes de Souza | first = Marcelo | title = Which right to which city?

==Overview==
Lefebvre summarizes the idea as a "demand...[for] a transformed and renewed access to urban life".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Lefebvre | first = Henri | author-link = Henri Lefebvre | contribution = The right to the city | editor-last1 = Kofman | editor-first1 = Eleonore | editor-last2 = Lebas | editor-first2 = Elizabeth | title = Writings on cities | page = 158 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell]] | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780631191889 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Attoh | first = Kafui | title = What ''kind'' of right is the right to the city? | journal = [[Progress in Human Geography]] | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = 669–685 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0309132510394706 | date = October 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0309132510394706 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] described it as follows:
{{quote|The right to the city is far more than the individual liberty to access urban resources: it is a right to change ourselves by changing the city. It is, moreover, a common rather than an individual right since this transformation inevitably depends upon the exercise of a collective power to reshape the processes of urbanization. The freedom to make and remake our cities and ourselves is, I want to argue, one of the most precious yet most neglected of our human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Harvey | first = David | authorlink = David Harvey (geographer) | title = The right to the city | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = II | issue = 53 | pages = 23–40 | publisher = New Left Review | date = September–October 2008 | url = http://newleftreview.org/II/53/david-harvey-the-right-to-the-city | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

More recently, scholars have proposed a 'Digital Right to the City',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Joe Shaw and Mark Graham | title = Our Digital Rights to the City | url = http://meatspacepress.org/ | website = meatspacepress.org | publisher = Meatspace Press | date = 15 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foth|first1=Marcus|last2=Brynskov|first2=Martin|last3=Ojala|first3=Timo|title=Citizen's Right to the Digital City: Urban Interfaces, Activism, and Placemaking|date=2015|publisher=Springer|location=Singapore|isbn=9789812879172|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/78107/}}&lt;/ref&gt; which involves thinking about the city as not just bricks and mortar, but also digital code and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shaw | first1 = Joe | last2 = Graham | first2 = Mark | title = An Informational Right to the City?

The '''''Software Engineering Body of Knowledge''''' ('''SWEBOK''') is an international standard ISO/IEC TR 19759:2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=33897|title=ISO/IEC TR 19759:2005 |accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifying a guide to the generally accepted Software Engineering Body of Knowledge.

The Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK Guide) has been created through cooperation among several professional bodies and members of industry and is published by the [[IEEE Computer Society]] ([[IEEE]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Guide to the software engineering body of knowledge : 2004 version," Library of Congress Online Catalog, 2005, http://lccn.loc.gov/2005921729. Retrieved 16 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The standard can be accessed freely from the [[IEEE Computer Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/swebok/home |title=SWEBOK |publisher=Computer.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2013, SWEBOK V3 was approved for publication and released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/pressroom/New-Version-of-Guide-to-the-Software-Engineering-Body-of-Knowledge-Approved |title=New Version of Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge Approved | accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the IEEE Computer Society kicked off the SWEBoK Evolution effort to develop future iterations of the body of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.computer.org/web/peb/swebok-evolution |title=SWEBoK Evolution | accessdate=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SWEBOK Version 3==
The published version of SWEBOK V3 has the following 15 [[knowledge area]]s (KAs) within the field of [[software engineering]]:

* [[Software requirements]]
* [[Software design]]
* [[Software construction]]
* [[Software testing]]
* [[Software maintenance]]
* [[Software configuration management]]
* [[Software engineering management]]
* [[Software engineering process]]
* [[Software engineering]] models and methods
* [[Software quality]]
* [[Software engineering professional practice]]
* [[Software engineering economics]]
* Computing foundations
* Mathematical foundations
* Engineering foundations

It also recognized, but did not define, these related disciplines:

* [[Computer engineering]]
* [[Systems engineering]]
* [[Project management]]
* [[Quality management]]
* General [[management]]
* [[Computer science]]
* [[Mathematics]]

== 2004 Edition of the SWEBOK ==
The 2004 edition of the SWEBOK guide defined ten [[knowledge area]]s (KAs) within the field of [[software engineering]]:
* [[Software requirements]]
* [[Software design]]
* [[Software construction]]
* [[Software testing]]
* [[Software maintenance]]
* [[Software configuration management]]
* Software engineering management ([[Engineering management]])
* [[Software engineering process]]
* [[Software engineering tools and methods]]
* [[Software quality]]

The SWEBOK also defines disciplines related to software engineering:
* [[Computer engineering]]
* [[Computer science]]
* [[Management]]
* [[Mathematics]]
* [[Project management]]
* [[Quality management]]
* Software ergonomics ([[Cognitive ergonomics]])
* [[Systems engineering]]

== Similar Efforts ==
A similar effort to define a body of knowledge for software engineering is the "Computing Curriculum Software Engineering (CCSE)," officially named [[Software Engineering 2004]] (SE2004). The curriculum largely overlaps with the 2004 SWEBOK V2 because the SWEBOK has been used as one of its sources; however, it is more directed towards academia. Whereas the [[SWEBOK]] Guide defines the [[software engineering]] knowledge that practitioners should have after four years of practice, SE2004 defines the knowledge that an [[undergraduate]] software engineering student should possess upon graduation (including knowledge of mathematics, general engineering principles, and other related areas). SWEBOK V3 aims to address these intersections.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3206">'''Solidarism''' or '''solidarist''' can refer to:
* The term "[[Corporatism#Corporate solidarism|solidarism]]" is applied to the sociopolitical thought advanced by [[Léon Bourgeois]] based on ideas by the sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] which is loosely applied to a leading social philosophy operative during and within the French Third Republic prior to the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, J.E.S., "Solidarist Syndicalism: Durkheim and DuGuit", ''Sociological Review'' 8 (1960) and Thompson, Kenneth, ''Émile Durkheim'', Routledge (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
* A member of the [[American Solidarity Party]], a minor [[Christian Democratic]] party in the United States, is often referred to as a "Solidarist"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americamagazine.org/issue/confessions-solidarist|title=Confessions of a Solidarist|last=Conley|first=John J.|date=8 September 2016|publisher=America Magazine|language=English|accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Social Catholicism" or the application of the [[Catholic social teaching]] as outlined in the papal social [[encyclical]]s and promoted by Heinrich Pesch (1854-1926) in his Teaching Guide to Economics.&lt;ref&gt; Pesch, Heinrich, ''Teaching Guide to Economics'' (10 volumes), translated by Rupert Ederler, Edwin Mellen Press (2003); and, Storck, Thomas, "A Giant Among Catholic Economists", ''New Oxford Review'' (February 2005) &lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Sweden|Swedish]] system of labor arrangement in which labor unions and capitalists jointly set wages below market clearing levels. From this arrangement, labor receives [[full employment]] and wage leveling, while capitalists pay less for labor, and do not have to worry about their employees being "poached" by firms who can offer more. This arrangement is traditionally enforced through employer organizations. The arrangement is destabilized during economic booms, when firms cheat on the system and surreptitiously raise "compensation", rather than pay, in the form of increased benefits, safety, or other forms of indirect payment.
* Among the [[History of far-right movements in France|French far-right]], solidarism refers to a tendency which was headed by [[Jean-Pierre Stirbois]] and [[Michel Collinot]] ([[French Solidarist Movement]]). Solidarists support a non-capitalist, non-communist "[[Third Position|third way]]", and are generally opponents of the influence of both the Soviet Union and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Jonathan (1995). The National Front and French Politics. New York: New York University Press. pp.36&lt;/ref&gt; It was recently an influence of the [[Radical Network]]. [[National Front (France)|National Front]] member [[Roger Holeindre]] claims to follow this tendency.
*An element within the [[White movement]] in Russia opposed to Communism and seeking a Christian alternative to collectivism was called the [[National Alliance of Russian Solidarists]].

'''Spertus Institute for Jewish Learning and Leadership&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Confidential,'' Chicago Tribune, Business, Section 2, Sunday, January 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;''' is an educational center in [[Chicago]], Illinois. Not affiliated with any single branch of [[Judaism]], Spertus offers learning opportunities that are "rooted in Jewish wisdom and culture and open to all."&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://www.spertus.edu/about "About"] on the Spertus Institute website&lt;/ref&gt;  Graduate programs and workshops "train leaders and engage individuals in exploration of Jewish life."&lt;ref name=about /&gt;  Public programs include films,&lt;ref&gt;''Spertus to screen tale of two cultures,'' Chicago Tribune, November 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; speakers,&lt;ref&gt;''Book marks,'' Chicago Jewish Star, January 25-February 7, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; seminars, concerts,&lt;ref&gt;''Jazz meets Jewish music in a Hanukkah Jam,'' Chicago Tribune, December 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and exhibits&lt;ref&gt;''Tales, Myths, and Nightmares,'' JUF News, December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; — at the Institute’s main campus at 610 S. [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]], as well as in the Chicago suburbs and online.

Spertus offers graduate degrees in Jewish Professional Studies, Jewish Studies, and until 2016, Nonprofit Management — accredited by [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] — as well as professional workshops and a range of public educational and cultural programs.

Well-known presenters have included [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spertus welcomes Justice Ginsburg|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-12B540E2B3246840.html|newspaper=Lake Villa Review|date=October 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; author [[Jonathan Safran Foer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Catlin|first=John|title=At Spertus talk, taking the next step Foer-ward|url=http://chicagomaroon.com/2013/01/14/at-spertus-talk-taking-the-next-step-foer-ward/|newspaper=The Chicago Maroon|date=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; architect [[Moshe Safdie]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Safdie, Ando, Pedret and Rural Studio's Andrew Freear among names on November calendar of Architectural Events in Chicago|url=http://arcchicago.blogspot.com/2006/11/safdie-ando-pedret-and-rural-studios.html|publisher=ArchitectureChicago PLUS|accessdate=November 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[hip-hop]] artist [[Y-Love]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Y-Love|url=http://www.songkick.com/concerts/675082-ylove-at-spertus-institute-of-jewish-studies|publisher=Songkick}}&lt;/ref&gt; pianist/actor/playwright [[Hershey Felder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kapos|first=Shia|title=Hershey Felder's special appearance will raise funds for Spertus|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20100720/BLOGS03/307209988/hershey-felders-special-appearance-will-raise-funds-for-spertus|newspaper=Crain's Chicago Business|date=July 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[New York Times]] columnist [[Thomas Friedman]], Psychologist Dr. [[Tal Ben-Shahar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spertus.edu/press-releases/tal-ben-shahar |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215145412/http://www.spertus.edu/press-releases/tal-ben-shahar |archivedate=2016-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and statistician [[Nate Silver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Caro|first=Mark|title=Nate Silver: In Hollywood, 'Nobody knows anything'|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-05-15/entertainment/ct-ent-0516-nate-silver-20130515_1_nate-silver-so-many-predictions-silver-linings-playbook|accessdate=May 15, 2013|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture of the Spertus Institute building==
In November 2007, Spertus Institute opened an award-winning,&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago AIA Awards 2008,'' Architecture Week, January 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; environmentally sustainable facility at 610 S. Michigan Avenue. Designed by Chicago-based [[Krueck and Sexton Architects]], the building features interconnected interior spaces and an unusual ten-story faceted window wall that provides views of the Chicago skyline, [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], and [[Lake Michigan]]. This window wall is built from 726 individual pieces of glass in 556 different shapes.&lt;ref&gt;"Light radiates throughout new home of Spertus Institute of Jewish Studies," ''JUF News'', November 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The building also houses a 400-seat theater, space for community events and [[kosher]] catering facilities.

Like the surrounding buildings, many constructed in the period of architectural innovation that followed the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871, this building is forward-looking in its design and use of materials, while maintaining respect for its setting.{{fact|date=December 2017}} Like the bays of its 19th- and 20th-century neighbors, the facets that create the façade’s dynamic crystalline form allow light to extend into the narrow building, while expanding the views enjoyed from inside.{{or-inline|date=December 2017}} The geometry of the façade is unique because the surface is constantly tilting in three dimensions, resulting in individual units of glass that are parallelograms rather than rectangles.{{tone-inline|date=December 2017}} At the same time, the average size of each of the façade's individual panes of glass is consistent with the standard size of the windows in the buildings up and down [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]].{{fact|date=December 2017}}

The Spertus building was the first new construction in the [[Historic Michigan Boulevard District]] after the area was designated a Chicago Landmark in 2002. The cost of the Spertus project was more than $50 million.&lt;ref name ="Kamin"&gt;Blair Kamin, "Blades of Glass," ''Chicago Tribune'', November 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Meadville Lombard Theological School]], a [[Unitarian Universalist]] [[seminary]], relocated from its [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] location to the sixth floor of the Spertus building. Academic and administrative tasks of the school now take place in the Spertus building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meadville.edu/Ab_News_loopmove.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110103444/http://www.meadville.edu/Ab_News_loopmove.html |archivedate=2012-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10943">'''Systemic development''' is a process of thinking about development which uses a [[systems thinking]] approach to create a solution to a social, environmental, and economic stress which the world is suffering from.

== Overview ==
[[File:Sustainable development.svg|thumb|Development can be a combination of multiple disciplines. Sustainable development focuses on a balance of environmental, economic, and social.]]
The core approach of systemic development is a process for thinking holistically while addressing complex issues and progressing towards a mutual goal with high participation rates.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The process encompasses comprehension of current activities and future needs from a holistic perspective. For success, it is essential that the process moves from an integrated assessment to a sustainable assessment. The perspective must consider the many facets of the current and proposed development including the economic, social, environmental, political and ecological aspects. The idea behind a systemic development approach can be applied to many disciplines, similar to [[sustainable development]]. Systemic development is practice rather than [[sustainability]], which is an end state.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
[[Systems theory|General Systems Theory]] (GST) laid the foundation to systemic thinking. [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy|Ludwig Von Bertalanffy]] was known as the founder of the original principles of GST.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Cruz, Ivonne, Andri Stahel, and Manfred Max-Neef. "Towards a Systemic Development Approach: Building on the Human-Scale Development Paradigm." ''Ecological Economics'' 68.7 (2009): 2021-030. ''Elsevier''. Web. 20 Apr. 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.02.004&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1968, when GST was introduced in Bertalanffy’s book, ''General System Theory: Foundations, Development, Applications'', the traditional approach to development used linear thinking or cause-and-effect thinking. GST was influenced by many different types of theories such as “Chaos theory, complexity theory, catastrophe theory, cybernetics, fuzzy set theory, and learning matrices” &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spruill|first=Nina|last2=Kenney|first2=Con|last3=Kaplan|first3=Laura|date=2001-03-01|title=Community Development and Systems Thinking: Theory and Practice|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ncr.90110/abstract|journal=National Civic Review|language=en|volume=90|issue=1|pages=105–116|doi=10.1002/ncr.90110|issn=1542-7811}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1990, [[Peter Senge]], author of ''[[The Fifth Discipline]]'', wove systemic thinking approach into development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Concepts ==
The integration of ontology, methodology, epistemology, and axiology has formed an outline for GST. Together, these concepts and philosophies contribute to the theory of systemic development.&lt;ref&gt;Sedlacko, Michal, Andre Martinuzzi, Inge RÃ¸pke, Nuno Videira, and Paula Antunes. "Participatory Systems Mapping for Sustainable Consumption: Discussion of a Method Promoting Systemic Insights." ''Ecological Economics'' 106 (2014): 33-43. ''Elsevier''. Web. 05 Mar. 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0921800914002043/1-s2.0-S0921800914002043-main.pdf?_tid=9d75173e-4500-11e7-b416-00000aacb361&amp;acdnat=1496125640_f44c0f82766115a9b6be398ef056d52f&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ontological ===
[[Ontology]] is the most basic fundamental tool. In a systemic development approach, the first step is to define the boundaries, thresholds, and stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Sala, Serenella, Biagio Ciuffo, and Peter Nijkamp. "A Systemic Framework for Sustainability Assessment." ''Ecological Economics'' 119 (2015): 314-25. ''Elsevier''. Web. 05 Mar. 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0921800915003821/1-s2.0-S0921800915003821-main.pdf?_tid=24da3502-4500-11e7-951c-00000aacb35d&amp;acdnat=1496125438_401becd0b4afcc87524ef4bc3b8de9af&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Understanding what is, is crucial to understand the layers of complexity of the development needs.

=== Methodological ===
[[Methodology]] in systemic development must consider all variables, values, and sustainability principles, and aim to ensure that no elements have been neglected. It is important to ensure completeness, comprehensiveness, and transparency of the assessment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Mutual feedback and interactions between stakeholders should be modeled and assessed using carefully designed specific methodologies.

=== Epistemological ===
[[Epistemology]] stresses how dialogue and communication by the stakeholders are the key tools to systemic development. This is when the verification and confirmation of the facets of the development process are discovered. Insight from each stakeholder is important to enhance and broaden the perspective of all involved. It is essential to take these viewpoints into consideration because they influence the process, the trends, the drivers of change, and the interactions between the parts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is during this phase that learning is accomplished.

=== Axiological ===
Axiologology emphasizes the ethical and aesthetic responsibility during the development process. It is important because the solution manifested by the systemic development process needs to represent the values of the represented stakeholders.

==Framework ==
=== Holistic Thinking ===
To successfully achieve development through a [[systems approach]], holistic thinking is necessary. A holistic approach to a system thinks about each variable, the space between the variables and what defines the variable. “It’s the sum of the interaction of its parts”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In this process each individual must learn from each other to understand the whole system in a [[multidimensional]] way to find a solution. To think about development with a systemic lens, one needs to be able to see the whole instead of parts and understand the relationship between the parts, the way the parts move, what drives the behavior of the parts, what influences the flow or direction, and to understand why there are no more or no fewer parts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Flander, Katleen De, and Jeb Brugmann. "Pressure-Point Strategy: Leverages for Urban Systemic Transformation." ''Sustainability'' 9.1 (2017): 99. ''Sustainability''. Web. 15 May 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/9/1/99&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The many factors that make up the whole can be a complex system.

=== Stakeholders ===
Including many diverse stakeholders helps each individual to grow their own perspective, gain an understanding of others and to increase their creativity. Systemic involvement must strive for a [[Transdisciplinarity|transdisciplinary]] approach instead of a [[Multidisciplinary approach|multidisciplinary]] or [[interdisciplinary]] approach to achieve successful development.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Transdisciplinary allows for the integration of methodologies and epistemologies through collaboration of the different stakeholders. Including more perspectives in the loop will increase the chance of a successful solution.

=== Communication and Learning ===
The foundation of systemic development, systems thinking, when applied, creates knowledge which leads to expanded knowledge, which leads to success.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Dialog is an essential tool for sharing knowledge and translating it into action. Communication can provide feedback and insight about “system, culture, practices, and artifacts and about the objectives and values of the project sponsor, client, and other stakeholders.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Learning happens during the dialog process as each stakeholder comes to observe other stakeholder’s values and ideas about what successful development would encompass.

''The Fifth Element'', by Peter Senge, emphasizes the importance of learning to improve lives using systems thinking. Individuals who acquire information, knowledge, and skills from other stakeholders and the environment tend to experience a change in their own lives and livelihood.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; They themselves then become the agents of change by sharing their knowledge with others.&lt;ref&gt;Work Bank. Knowledge for Development. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999, p, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Complex loop ===
A feedback loop, closed loop, or systems complex model is a tool to help cope with complexity&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and understand the system as a whole. The tool will help to visualize the direction, velocity, delay time, long term and short term effects, and to help see the dynamic process. Feedback is necessary to learn about each other, including objectives and values of stakeholders and officials. A systemic approach to development is change oriented. The approach must encourage humans to communicate through interpersonal interactions, address the values of each stakeholder, and take part in developing and understanding the complex loop.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Goals ==
[[File:Systems_thinking_about_the_society.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Systems_thinking_about_the_society.svg|thumb|Parts, society, needs, means, individuals, and bigger picture are pieces of the puzzle that must be accounted for to make systemic development successful.]]
Systemic development is based on the principle that one must understand the complexity of the whole system to develop a solution. This can be accomplished by learning different elements in the system and applying them to their existing knowledge. We must learn about the past suggested solutions, the balance of the system, influx of the system, the challenges within the system, the best timing for each element, learning about uncertainty of cause-and-effect, the best leverage points in the system, the system does not work unless every piece is functioning at its prime, and there is no one individual at fault if everyone is working together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/314017669|title=Systemic development : local solutions in a global environment|last=1944-|first=Sheffield, Jim,|last2=Emergence.|first2=Institute for the Study of Coherence and|last3=N.Z.)|first3=ANZSYS Conference (13th : 2007 : Auckland,|date=2009|publisher=Isce Publishing|isbn=9780981703275|oclc=314017669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of systemic development is to have community participants shift from being reactors to viewing themselves “as active participants in shaping their reality [to move] from reacting to the present to creating the future”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The non-linear processes must coincide, be fluid and strive to benefit all parties involved.

'''Thanatophages''', are [[olophage|olophages]] that obtain [[nutrient]]s by consuming decomposing dead plant biomass.&lt;ref&gt;Getz, W. (2011). Biomass transformation webs provide a unified approach to consumer–resource modelling. Ecology Letters, {{doi|10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01566.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 



==Ecology==
In [[food webs]], thanatophages generally play the roles of [[decomposers]]. 

The eating of wood, whether live or dead, is known as [[xylophagy]]. Τhe activity of animals feeding only on dead wood is called sapro-xylophagy and those animals, sapro-xylophagous.

==Saprophytes==
''Saprophyte'' (''-phyte'' meaning "plant") is a botanical term that is no longer in popular use. &lt;ref&gt;biology online&lt;/ref&gt;There are no real saprotrophic organisms that are [[embryophytes]],{{fact|date=December 2010}} and fungi and bacteria are no longer placed in the [[Plant|plant kingdom]]. Plants that were once considered saprophytes, such as non-photosynthetic [[Orchidaceae|orchid]]s and [[Monotropaceae|monotrope]]s, are now known to be [[parasite]]s on fungi. These species are now termed [[Myco-heterotrophy|myco-heterotroph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hershey DR. 1999. Myco-heterophytes and parasitic plants in food chains an webs.

'''The Milky Way Project''' is a [[Zooniverse (citizen science project)|Zooniverse]] project whose main goal is to identify [[stellar-wind bubble]]s in the [[Milky Way Galaxy]]. Users classify sets of [[infrared]] images from the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer ([[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer|WISE]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/povich/milky-way-project/about/research|title=Zooniverse|website=www.zooniverse.org|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists believe bubbles in these images are the result of young, massive stars whose light causes shocks in interstellar gas.

[[File:Bubbles Within Bubbles.jpg|thumb|An example of what is called a hierarchical bubble structure, in which one giant bubble, carved into the dust of space by massive stars, has triggered the formation of smaller bubbles]]

==Details==

The Milky Way Project works with data taken from the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer Galactic Plane Survey (MIPSGAL) and Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE). Only a small part uses WISE data. The project looks for bubbles, which can mean the formation of stars. The project also looks for knots, star clusters, and other objects such as young stars, [[supernova]] remnants, and newly discovered galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milky Way Project|url=http://spacehack.org/project/milky-way-project|website=Spacehack|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Milky Way Project: Can you help?|url=http://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov/news-display.cfm?News_ID=574|website=Night Sky Network|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory - California Institute of Technology|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Milky Way Project started as the ninth Zooniverse project in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.milkywayproject.org/2010/06/26/coming-soon/|title=Coming Soon…|last=Zooniverse|first=The|date=2010-06-26|website=The Milky Way Project Blog|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.milkywayproject.org/2010/12/07/site-goes-live/|title=Site Goes Live|last=ttfnrob|date=2010-12-07|website=The Milky Way Project Blog|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''phase 1'' worked with the colors: 4.5 μm for blue, 8.0 μm for green and 24 μm for red. This resulted in the Data Release 1 (DR1) of the Milky Way Project in 2012 with 5,106 bubbles, which can also be found in [[SIMBAD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simpson|first=R. J.|last2=Povich|first2=M. S.|last3=Kendrew|first3=S.|last4=Lintott|first4=C.

The ''annulus tool'' that was used to mark the bubbles in the Milky Way Project ''phase 1'' was at random round and needed improvement. This problem was solved after the introduction of the ''ellipse tool''. This new tool was used in the ''phase 2'' of the project, short after DR1. This changed the classification and the tool does fit the actual shape of the bubbles. The phase 2 also used different colors: 3.6 μm for blue, 4.5 μm for green and 8.0 μm for red. The same three colors as [http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/AladinLite/?target=&amp;fov=3.00&amp;survey=P%2FGLIMPSE360 GLIMPSE 360 in Aladin Lite].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://polyastron.wordpress.com/2016/10/12/a-brief-history-of-the-milky-way-project-why-we-still-need-your-help/ |title=A Brief History of the Milky Way Project: Why We (Still) Need Your Help |author=tharinduj96 |date=2016-10-12 |website=The Milky Way Project Blog |access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Phase 3'' is also called Phoenix since it started after a year offline&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://polyastron.wordpress.com/2016/09/15/the-milky-way-project-phoenix/ |title=The Milky Way Project: Phoenix |last=Povich |first=Matthew S. |date=2016-09-15 |website=The Milky Way Project Blog |access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is now active. Phase 3 uses the same colors as phase 1 and the same ellipse tool as phase 2, combining the strength of phase 1+2.

The Milky Way Project did also search for star clusters and galaxies. Phase 2 additionally did search for Extended Green Objects (EGO), 4.5 μm emissions that seem to be connected to [[Astrophysical maser|outflow from massive young stellar objects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cyganowski|first=C.

They are now called ''yellow balls'', a mix of compact [[Star formation|star-forming regions]] that show transition into bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kerton|first=C.

Phase 3 aims to create a reliable bubble catalog (DR2) with the data from phase 2+3 (4.4 million classifications), an improved yellowball catalog and the largest bowshock catalog to date. For this goal the 24 μm part of the image is important: Bubbles are more easy to spot and bowshocks are most of the time visible at this wavelength.

The ''MWP classification aggregation pipeline'' is continuously tested and modified to avoid issues that were encountered in DR1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3331">'''Theodore Bar Konai''' ({{lang-syr|ܬܐܕܘܪܘܣ ܒܪ ܟܘܢܝ}}) was a distinguished Assyrian exegete and apologist of the [[Church of the East]] who seems to have flourished at the end of the eighth century.  His most famous work was a book of ''Scholia'' on the Old and New Testaments.

== Life and works ==
Bar Konai appears to have lived during the reign of [[Timothy I (Nestorian patriarch)|Timothy I]] (780–823), [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East|Patriarch of the Church of the East]], though some scholars have placed him a century later. [[Assemani]] identified him with a bishop named Theodore, the nephew of the patriarch [[Yohannan IV]] (900–5), who was appointed to the diocese of Lashom in [[Beth Garmaï (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Beth Garmaï]] in 893, and his dating was followed by Wright.&lt;ref&gt;Assemani, ''BO'', ii. 440 and iii. 1, 198, Wright, ''Syriac Literature'', 222&lt;/ref&gt;  Chabot and Baum and Winkler, however, both place him at the end of the eighth century.&lt;ref&gt;Chabot, ''Syriac Language and Literature''; Baum and Winkler, ''Church of the East'', 63&lt;/ref&gt;  

Theodore was the author of a book of ''[[Scholia]]'' (''Kṯāḇā d-ʾeskoliyon'') on both the Old and New Testaments (edited between 1908 and 1912 by the celebrated scholar [[Addai Scher]]), believed to have been written circa 792.  The ''Scholia'' offer an apologetic presentation in nine chapters, similar to a catechism, of East Syrian Christianity, and contain a valuable overview, in a tenth and eleventh chapter, of heretical doctrines and non-Christian religions such as [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Manichaeism]] and [[Islam]], with which Theodore sharply disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;Baum and Winkler, ''Church of the East'', 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodore was also the author of an ecclesiastical history, a treatise against [[Monophysitism]], a treatise against the [[Arianism]], a colloquy between a pagan and a Christian, and a treatise on heresies.&lt;ref&gt;Chabot, ''Syriac Language and Literature''&lt;/ref&gt;  His ''Church History'' contains some interesting details of the lives of the Patriarchs of the Church of the East.&lt;ref&gt;Baum and Winkler, ''Church of the East'', 63&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the class of poisonous substances}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}
A '''toxin''' (from {{lang-grc|τοξικόν|[[Arrow poison|toxikon]]}}) is a [[poison]]ous substance produced within living cells or organisms;&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|eight/000109718|toxin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urltoxin - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/toxin |title=toxin - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |website= |accessdate=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; synthetic [[Biocide|toxicants]] created by artificial processes are thus excluded. The term was first used by organic chemist Ludwig Brieger (1849–1919).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oWhqhK1cE-gC&amp;pg=PA6|title=Endotoxin in Health and Disease|first=Helmut|last=Brade|date=2 July 1999|publisher=CRC Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780824719449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toxins can be [[small molecule]]s, [[peptide]]s, or [[protein]]s that are capable of causing disease on contact with or absorption by [[Biological tissue|body tissue]]s interacting with biological [[macromolecule]]s such as [[enzyme]]s or [[Receptor (biochemistry)|cellular receptors]]. Toxins vary greatly in their [[toxicity]], ranging from usually minor (such as a [[bee]] [[Stinger|sting]]) to almost immediately deadly (such as [[botulinum toxin]]).

==Terminology==
Toxins are often distinguished from other chemical agents by their method of production—the word toxin does not specify method of delivery (compare with [[venom]] and the broader meaning of [[poison]]—all substances that can also cause disturbances to organisms). It simply means it is a biologically produced poison.
There was an ongoing terminological dispute between [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]] over whether to call a toxin a [[Biological agent|biological]] or [[chemical agent]], in which the NATO opted for biological agent, and the Warsaw Pact, like most other countries in the world, for chemical agent.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

According to an [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] review of the [[Biological Weapons Convention]], "Toxins are poisonous products of organisms; unlike biological agents, they are inanimate and not capable of reproducing themselves", and "Since the signing of the Constitution, there have been no disputes among the parties regarding the definition of biological agents or toxins".&lt;ref name="urlThe Biological Weapons Convention - An overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JNPA |title=The Biological Weapons Convention - An overview |website= |accessdate=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Title 18 of the United States Code]], "... the term "toxin" means the [[Toxicity|toxic]] material or product of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[microorganism]]s (including, but not limited to, [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, [[fungi]], [[rickettsiae]] or [[protozoa]]), or infectious substances, or a [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] or synthesized molecule, whatever their origin and method of production..."&lt;ref name="urlU.S. Code"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law2.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t17t20+235+1++()%20%20AND%20((18)%20ADJ%20USC)%3ACITE%20AND%20(USC%20w/10%20(209))%3ACITE |title=U.S. Code |website= |accessdate=13 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721042611/http://law2.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t17t20+235+1++%28%29%20%20AND%20%28%2818%29%20ADJ%20USC%29%3ACITE%20AND%20%28USC%20w%2F10%20%28209%29%29%3ACITE |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rather informal terminology of individual toxins relates them to the anatomical location where their effects are most notable:
* [[Hemotoxin]], causes destruction of [[red blood cells]] ([[hemolysis]])
* [[Phototoxin]], causes dangerous photosensitivity

On a broader scale, toxins may be classified as either [[exotoxin]]s, being excreted by an organism, or [[endotoxin]]s, that are released mainly when bacteria are [[lysis|lysed]].

== Biotoxins ==
The term "biotoxin" is sometimes used to explicitly confirm the biological origin.&lt;ref name="urlbiotoxin - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/biotoxin |title=biotoxin - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |website= |accessdate=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|one/000012874|biotoxin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biotoxins can be further classified, for example, as [[mycotoxin|fungal biotoxins]], microbial biotoxins, [[phytotoxin|plant biotoxins]], or animal biotoxins.

Toxins produced by [[microorganism]]s are important [[virulence]] determinants responsible for microbial [[pathogenicity]] and/or evasion of the host [[immune response]].&lt;ref name= ProftT&gt;{{cite book |author= Proft T (editor)| year=2009 |title=Microbial Toxins: Current Research and Future Trends | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-44-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biotoxins vary greatly in purpose and mechanism, and can be highly complex (the [[venom]] of the [[cone snail]] contains dozens of small [[protein]]s, each targeting a specific nerve channel or receptor), or relatively small protein.

Biotoxins in nature have two primary functions:

* [[Predation]], such as in the [[spider]], [[snake]], [[scorpion]], [[jellyfish]], and [[wasp]]
* Defense as in the [[bee]], [[ant]], [[termite]], [[honey bee]], [[wasp]], and [[poison dart frog]]

Some of the more well known types of biotoxins include:
*[[Cyanotoxin]]s, produced by [[cyanobacteria]]
*[[Dinotoxin]]s, produced by [[dinoflagellate]]s
*[[Necrosis|Necrotoxins]] cause necrosis (i.e., death) in the cells they encounter and destroy all types of [[biological tissue|tissue]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. Necrotoxins spread through the bloodstream{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. In humans, [[skin]] and [[muscle]] tissues are most sensitive to necrotoxins{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. Organisms that possess necrotoxins include:
**The [[brown recluse spider|brown recluse]] or "fiddle back" spider
**Most [[rattlesnake]]s and [[vipers]] produce [[phospholipase]] and various [[trypsin]]-like [[serine proteases]]
**[[Bitis arietans|Puff adder]]
**[[Necrotizing fasciitis]] (caused by the "flesh eating" bacterium ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'') - produces a [[pore-forming toxin|pore forming toxin]]
*[[Neurotoxin]]s primarily affect the nervous systems of animals. The group neurotoxins generally consists of [[:Category:Ion channel toxins|ion channel toxins]] that disrupt ion channel conductance. Organisms that possess neurotoxins include:
**The [[Latrodectus|black widow]] spider.
**Most [[scorpion]]s
**The [[box jellyfish]]
**[[Elapidae|Elapid]] snakes
**The [[cone snail]]
**The [[Blue-ringed octopus]]
**[[Venomous fish]]
**[[Frogs]]
**''[[Palythoa]]'' [[coral]]
**Various different types of [[algae]], [[cyanobacteria]] and [[dinoflagellates]] 
*[[Myotoxin]]s are small, basic [[peptide]]s found in [[snake]] and [[lizard]] [[Venom (poison)|venom]]s, They cause muscle tissue damage by a non enzymatic receptor based mechanism. Organisms that possess myotoxins include:
**[[rattlesnake]]s
**[[eastern bearded dragon]]
*[[Cytotoxicity|Cytotoxins]] are toxic at the level of individual cells, either in a non-specific fashion or only in certain types of living cells:
**[[Ricin]], from [[castor bean]]s
**[[Apitoxin]], from [[honey bee]]s
**[[T-2 mycotoxin]], from certain toxic [[mushroom]]s

==Environmental toxins==
The term "environmental toxin" can sometimes explicitly include synthetic contaminants&lt;ref name="pmid14977703"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Grigg J |title=Environmental toxins; their impact on children's health |journal=Arch. Dis. Child. |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=244–50 |date=March 2004 |pmid=14977703 |pmc=1719840 |doi= 10.1136/adc.2002.022202|url=http://adc.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14977703}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as industrial [[pollutant]]s and other artificially made [[Toxicity|toxic]] substances. As this contradicts most formal definitions of the term "toxin", it is important to confirm what the researcher means when encountering the term outside of microbiological contexts.

Environmental toxins from [[food chain]]s that may be dangerous to human health include:

=== Finding information about toxins===
The Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program (TEHIP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/enviro.html|title=Environmental Health and Toxicology Information ? National Library of Medicine|author=|date=|website=sis.nlm.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM) maintains a comprehensive toxicology and environmental health web site that includes access to toxins-related resources produced by TEHIP and by other government agencies and organizations. This web site includes links to databases, bibliographies, tutorials, and other scientific and consumer-oriented resources. TEHIP also is responsible for the Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/|title=TOXNET|author=|date=|website=toxnet.nlm.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; an integrated system of toxicology and environmental health databases that are available free of charge on the web.

[[TOXMAP]] is a Geographic Information System (GIS) that is part of TOXNET. TOXMAP uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA) [[Toxics Release Inventory]] and [[Superfund Basic Research Program]]s.

=== Computational resources for prediction of toxic peptides and proteins===
One of the bottlenecks in peptide/protein-based therapy is their toxicity. Recently, ''in silico'' models for predicting toxicity of peptides and proteins, developed by [[Gajendra Pal Singh Raghava]]'s group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = In Silico Approach for Predicting Toxicity of Peptides and Proteins | author = Sudheer Gupta, Pallavi Kapoor, Kumardeep Chaudhary, Ankur Gautam, Rahul Kumar, Open Source Drug Discovery Consortium, Gajendra P. S. Raghava | journal = PLOS ONE | date = 2013 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0073957 | volume=8 | issue = 9 | pages=e73957 | pmid=24058508 | pmc=3772798| bibcode=2013PLoSO...873957G }}&lt;/ref&gt; predict toxicity with reasonably good accuracy. The prediction models are based on machine learning technique and quantitative matrix using various properties of peptides. The prediction tool is freely accessible to public in the form of web server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/toxinpred|title=ToxinPred|author=|date=|website=crdd.osdd.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misuse of the term==
When used non-technically, the term "toxin" is often applied to any [[Toxicity|toxic]] substance, even though the term [[toxicant]] would be more appropriate. Toxic substances not directly of biological origin are also termed [[poison]]s and many non-technical and lifestyle journalists follow this usage to refer to [[toxicity|toxic]] substances in general.{{clarify|date=August 2015}}

In the context of [[quackery]] and [[alternative medicine]], the term "toxin" is used to refer to any substance alleged to cause ill health. This could range from trace amounts of potentially dangerous [[pesticide]]s, to supposedly harmful substances produced in the body by intestinal fermentation ([[Colon cleansing|auto-intoxication]]), to food ingredients such as [[sucrose|table sugar]], [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG), and [[aspartame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/detox_overview.html | title = "Detoxification" Schemes and Scams | publisher = [[Quackwatch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marocaster coronatus MHNT.PAL.2010.2.2 (Close up).jpg|thumb|right|Type specimen for ''[[Marocaster coronatus]]'' - [[Muséum de Toulouse]]]]
In biology, a '''type''' is a particular [[wiktionary:en:specimen|specimen]] (or in some cases a group of specimens) of an [[organism]] to which the [[scientific name]] of that organism is formally attached. In other words, a type is an example that serves to anchor or centralize the defining features of that particular [[taxon]]. In older usage (pre-1900 in botany), a type was a taxon rather than a specimen.&lt;ref name=Hitchcock/&gt;

A taxon is a scientifically named grouping of organisms with other like organisms, a [[set (mathematics)|set]] that includes some organisms and excludes others, based on a detailed published description (for example a [[species description]]) and on the provision of type material, which is usually available to scientists for examination in a major museum research collection, or similar institution.&lt;ref name=Hitchcock&gt;{{citation |author=Hitchcock, A.S. |year=1921 |title=The Type Concept in Systematic Botany |journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=251–255 |jstor=2434993 |doi=10.2307/2434993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smithsonian&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nicholson|first1=Dan H.|title=Botanical nomenclature, types, &amp; standard reference works|url=http://botany.si.edu/references/botlinks/dhntyp.htm|publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Department of Botany|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Type specimen==
According to a precise set of rules laid down in the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN) and the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN), the scientific name of every taxon is almost always based on one particular ''specimen'', or in some cases specimens. Types are of great significance to biologists, especially to [[taxonomist]]s. Types are usually physical specimens that are kept in a [[museum]] or [[herbarium]] research collection, but failing that, an image of an individual of that taxon has sometimes been designated as a type.&lt;ref name="MarshallEvenhuis2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Evenhuis|first2=Neal L.|last1=Marshall|first1=Stephen A.|title=New species without dead bodies: a case for photo-based descriptions, illustrated by a striking new species of ''Marleyimyia'' Hesse (Diptera, Bombyliidae) from South Africa |journal=ZooKeys |volume=525 |year=2015 |pages=117–127 |issn=1313-2970 |doi=10.3897/zookeys.525.6143 |pmid=26487819 |pmc=4607853}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing species and appointing type specimens is part of [[scientific nomenclature]] and [[alpha taxonomy]].

When identifying material, a scientist attempts to apply a taxon name to a specimen or group of specimens based on his or her understanding of the relevant taxa, based on (at least) having read the type description(s), preferably based on an examination of all the type material of all of the relevant taxa. If there is more than one named type that all appear to be the same taxon, then the oldest name takes precedence, and is considered to be the correct name of the material in hand. If on the other hand the taxon appears never to have been named at all, then the scientist or another qualified expert picks a type specimen and publishes a new name and an official description.

This process is crucial to the science of biological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]. People's ideas of how living things should be grouped change and shift over time. How do we know that what we call "''[[Canis lupus]]''" is the same thing,  or approximately the same thing, as what they will be calling "''Canis lupus''" in 200 years' time? It is possible to check this because there is a particular wolf specimen preserved in Sweden&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-037-01-0001.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924115145/http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-037-01-0001.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and everyone who uses that name – no matter what else they may mean by it – will include that particular specimen.

Depending on the [[Nomenclature Codes|nomenclature code]] applied to the organism in question, a type can be a specimen, a culture, an [[Biological illustration|illustration]], or (under the bacteriological code) a description. Some codes consider a subordinate taxon to be the type, but under the botanical code the type is always a specimen or illustration.

For example, in the research collection of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London, there is a bird specimen numbered 1886.6.24.20. This is a specimen of a kind of bird commonly known as the [[spotted harrier]], which currently bears the scientific name ''Circus assimilis''. This particular specimen is the [[holotype]] for that species; the name ''Circus assimilis'' refers, by definition, to the species of that particular specimen. That species was named and described by Jardine and Selby in 1828, and the holotype was placed in the museum collection so that other scientists might refer to it as necessary.

Note that at least for type specimens there is no requirement for a "typical" individual to be used. [[Genera]] and [[family (biology)|families]], particularly those established by early taxonomists, tend to be named after species that are more "typical" for them, but here too this is not always the case and due to changes in [[systematics]] ''cannot'' be. Hence, the term [[name-bearing type]] or onomatophore is sometimes used, to denote the fact that biological types do not define "typical" individuals or [[taxa]], but rather fix a scientific name to a specific [[wiktionary:operational taxonomic unit|operational taxonomic unit]]. Type specimens are theoretically even allowed to be aberrant or deformed individuals or color variations, though this is rarely chosen to be the case, as it makes it hard to determine to which population the individual belonged.&lt;ref name="Hitchcock" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt;&lt;ref name=CANBR&gt;{{cite web|title=Plant names – a basic introduction|url=http://www.cpbr.gov.au/chah/avh/help/names/|publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens, Centre for Australian National Biodiversity Research|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usage of the term ''type'' is somewhat complicated by slightly different uses in [[botany]] and [[zoology]]. In the ''[[PhyloCode]]'', type-based definitions are replaced by [[phylogenetic nomenclature|phylogenetic definitions]].

==Older terminology==
In some older taxonomic works the word "type" has sometimes been used differently. The meaning was similar in the first ''Laws of Botanical Nomenclature'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=de Candolle, A.P.|year=1867|title=Lois de la nomenclature botanique adoptées par le Congrès International de Botanique tenu à Paris en août 1867 suivies d'une deuxième édition de l'introduction historique et du commentaire qui accompagnaient la rédaction préparatoire présentée à la congrès|publisher=J.-B.

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|fr|Ce seul caractère permet de distinguer ce type de toutes les autres espèces de la section. … Après avoir étudié ces diverses formes, j'en arrivai à les considérer comme appartenant à un seul et même type spécifique.}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Translation: This single character permits [one to] distinguish this type from all other species of the section ... After studying the diverse forms, I came to consider them as belonging to the one and the same specific type.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=={{anchor|botany|Botany}}In botany==
In [[botanical nomenclature]], a ''type'' (''typus'', ''nomenclatural type''), "is that element to which the name of a taxon is permanently attached." (article 7.1)&lt;ref name=ICN/&gt; In botany a type is either a specimen or an illustration. A specimen is a real plant (or one or more parts of a plant or a lot of small plants), dead and kept safe, "curated", in a [[herbarium]] (or the equivalent for fungi). Examples of where an illustration may serve as a type include:
* A detailed drawing, painting, etc., depicting the plant, from the early days of plant taxonomy. A dried plant was difficult to transport and hard to keep safe for the future; many specimens from the early days of botany have since been lost or damaged. Highly skilled botanical artists were sometimes employed by a botanist to make a faithful and detailed illustration. Some such illustrations have become the best record and have been chosen to serve as the type of a taxon.
* A detailed picture of something that can be seen only through a [[microscope]]. A tiny "plant" on a [[microscope slide]] makes for a poor type: the microscope slide may be lost or damaged, or it may be very difficult to find the "plant" in question among whatever else is on the microscope slide. An illustration makes for a much more reliable type (Art 37.5 of the ''Vienna Code'', 2006).

Note that a type does not determine the [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]] of the taxon. For example, the common [[dandelion]] is a controversial taxon: some botanists consider it to consist of over a hundred species, and others regard it as a single species. The type of the name ''Taraxacum officinale'' is the same whether the circumscription of the species includes all those small species (''Taraxacum officinale'' is a "big" species) or whether the circumscription is limited to only one small species among the other hundred (''Taraxacum officinale'' is a "small" species). The name ''Taraxacum officinale'' is the same and the type of the name is the same, but the extent of what the name actually applies to varies greatly. Setting the circumscription of a taxon is done by a taxonomist in a publication.

Miscellaneous notes:
# Only a species or an [[infraspecific taxon]] can have a type of its own. For most new [[taxon|taxa]] (published on or after 1 January 2007, article 37) at these ranks a type should not be an illustration.
# A [[genus]] has the same type as that of one of its [[species]] (article 10).
# A [[Family (biology)|family]] has the same type as that of one of its [[genus|genera]] (article 10).

The ''ICN'' provides a listing of the various kinds of type (article 9),&lt;ref name=ICN&gt;{{cite book|author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012|volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011|publisher=A.R.G.

* holotype
* lectotype
* isotype
* syntype
* paratype
* neotype

Note that the word "type" appears in botanical literature as a part of some older terms that have no status under the ''ICN'': for example a clonotype.

==In zoology==
[[File:JamidesEliotiMUpUnAC1.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Lycaenidae|gossamer-winged butterfly]], ''[[Jamides elioti]]'':&lt;br&gt;1) [[Dorsum (anatomy)|dorsal]] and 2) ventral aspect of holotype,&lt;br&gt;3) dorsal and 4) ventral aspect of paratype]]
In [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|zoological nomenclature]], the type of a species or subspecies is a specimen, or series of specimens.  The type of a genus or subgenus is a species. The type of a suprageneric taxon (e.g., family, etc.) is a genus. Names higher than superfamily rank do not have types. A "name-bearing type" is a specimen or image that "provides the objective standard of reference whereby the application of the name of a nominal taxon can be determined."

===Definitions===
* A type specimen is a vernacular term (not a formally defined term) typically used for an individual or fossil that is any of the various name-bearing types for a [[species]]. For example, the type specimen for the species ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'' was the specimen "Neanderthal-1" discovered by [[Johann Karl Fuhlrott]] in 1856 at Feldhofer in the Neander Valley in Germany, consisting of a [[Calvaria (skull)|skullcap]], thigh bones, part of a pelvis, some ribs, and some arm and shoulder bones. There may be more than one type specimen, but there is (at least in modern times) only one holotype.
* A [[type species]] is the [[nominal species]] that is the name-bearing type of a nominal [[genus]] or [[subgenus]].
* A [[type genus]] is the [[nominal genus]] that is the name-bearing type of a nominal family-group taxon.
* The [[type series]] are all those specimens included by the author in a taxon's formal description, unless the author explicitly or implicitly excludes them as part of the series.

===Use of type specimens===
[[File:Mormopterus acetabulosus type illustration.jpg|thumb|Type illustration of ''[[Mormopterus acetabulosus]]'']]
Although in reality biologists may examine many specimens (when available) of a new taxon before writing an official published species description, nonetheless, under the formal rules for naming species (the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature), a single type must be designated, as part of the published description.

A type description must include a diagnosis (typically, a discussion of similarities to and differences from closely related species), and an indication of where the type specimen or specimens are deposited for examination. The geographical location where a type specimen was originally found is known as its '''{{visible anchor|type locality}}'''. In the case of parasites, the term '''{{visible anchor|type host}}''' (or symbiotype) is used to indicate the host organism from which the type specimen was obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3283335|title=Designation and Curatorial Management of Type Host Specimens (Symbiotypes) for New Parasite Species|jstor=3283335|author1=Frey, Jennifer K. |author2=Yates, Terry L. |author3=Duszynski, Donald W. |author4=Gannon, William L. |author5=Gardner, Scott L. |last-author-amp=yes |journal=The Journal of Parasitology| volume=78|issue=5|year=1992| pages=930–993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoological collections are maintained by universities and museums. Ensuring that types are kept in good condition and made available for examination by taxonomists are two important functions of such collections. And, while there is only one ''holotype'' designated, there can be other "type" specimens, the following of which are formally defined:

====Holotype====
{{main|Holotype}}
When a single specimen is clearly designated in the original description, this specimen is known as the ''holotype'' of that species. The holotype is typically placed in a major museum, or similar well-known public collection, so that it is freely available for later examination by other biologists.

====Paratype====
{{main|Paratype}}
When the original description designated a holotype, there may still be additional specimens listed in the type series and those are termed paratypes. These are not [[name-bearing type]]s.

====Allotype====
An allotype is a specimen of the opposite sex to the holotype, designated from among paratypes. It was also formerly used for a specimen that shows features not seen in the holotype of a fossil.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth2010"/&gt; The term is not regulated by the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]].

====Neotype====
A neotype is a specimen later selected to serve as the single type specimen when an original holotype has been lost or destroyed or where the original author never cited a specimen.

====Syntype====
{{Main|Syntype}}
A syntype is any one of two or more specimens that is listed in a species description where no holotype was designated; historically, syntypes were often explicitly designated as such, and under the present ICZN this is a requirement, but modern attempts to publish species description based on syntypes are generally frowned upon by practicing taxonomists, and most are gradually being replaced by lectotypes. Those that still exist are still considered name-bearing types.

====Lectotype====
A lectotype is a specimen later selected to serve as the single type specimen for species originally described from a set of [[syntype]]s.
In zoology, a lectotype is a kind of [[name-bearing type]]. When a species was originally described on the basis of a name-bearing type consisting of multiple specimens, one of those may be designated as the lectotype. Having a single name-bearing type reduces the potential for confusion, especially considering that it is not uncommon for a series of syntypes to contain specimens of more than one species.

A notable example is that [[Carl Linnaeus]] is the lectotype for the species ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stearn, W. T. 1959. "The background of Linnaeus's contributions to the nomenclature and methods of systematic biology", ''Systematic Zoology'' 8 (1): 4-22, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paralectotype====
A paralectotype is any additional specimen from among a set of syntypes, after a lectotype has been designated from among them. These are not name-bearing types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hansen, Hans V. |author2=Seberg, Ole |title=Paralectotype, a new type term in botany |journal=Taxon |year=1984 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=707–711 |jstor=1220790 |doi=10.2307/1220790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hapantotype====
A special case in [[Protistan]]s where the type consists of two or more specimens of "directly related individuals representing distinct stages in the life cycle"; these are collectively treated as a single entity, and lectotypes cannot be designated from among them.

==== '''Iconotype''' ====
An illustration on which a new species or subspecies was based. For instance, the Burmese Python, ''[[Burmese python|Python bivittatus]],'' is one of many species that are based on illustrations by [[Albertus Seba]] (1734).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/62760#/summary|title=Locupletissimi Rerum naturalium Thesauri accurata Descriptio, et Iconibus artificiosissimus Expressio, per universam Physices Historiam.

The Complete Plates in Colour, 1734-1765. 2001.|url=|journal=International Society for the History and Bibliography of Herpetology|volume=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ergatotype====
An ergatotype is a specimen selected to represent a worker member in [[hymenopteran]]s which have polymorphic castes.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hawksworth |first=D.L. |title=Terms Used in Bionomenclature. The naming of organisms (and plant communities) |date=2010 |publisher=Global Biodiversity Information Facility |location=Copenhagen |isbn=87-92020-09-7 |pages=216 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qky7_6-UcQQC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=ergatotype&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vec4jfleDx&amp;sig=QmCXOeWRVuPYbjtVKFC7OPfaC5g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MtErU7mTL866oQSsn4C4CQ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ergatotype&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternatives to preserved specimens====
Type illustrations have also been used by zoologists, as in the case of the [[Réunion parakeet]], which is known only from historical illustrations and descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hume|first1=Julian Pender|title=Reappraisal of the parrots (Aves: Psittacidae) from the Mascarene Islands, with comments on their ecology, morphology, and affinities|url=http://julianhume.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Hume-Mascarene-Parrots.pdf|journal=Zootaxa|date=25 June 2007|accessdate=13 January 2011|ISSN=1175-5334|issue=1513|pages=1–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}}

Recently, some species have been described where the type specimen was released alive back into the wild, such as the [[Bulo Burti boubou]] (a [[bushshrike]]), described as ''Laniarius liberatus'', in which the species description included DNA sequences from blood and feather samples. Assuming there is no future question as to the status of such a species, the absence of a type specimen does not invalidate the name, but it may be necessary in the future to designate a neotype for such a taxon, should any questions arise. However, in the case of the bushshrike, ornithologists have argued that the specimen was a rare and hitherto unknown [[morph (zoology)|color morph]] of a long-known species, using only the available blood and feather samples. While there is still some debate on the need to deposit actual killed individuals as type specimens, it can be observed that given proper vouchering and storage, tissue samples can be just as valuable should disputes about the validity of a species arise.

====Formalisation of the type system====
The various types listed above are necessary{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} because many species were described one or two centuries ago, when a single type specimen, a holotype, was often not designated. Also, types were not always carefully preserved, and intervening events such as wars and fires have resulted in destruction of original type material. The validity of a species name often rests upon the availability of original type specimens; or, if the type cannot be found, or one has never existed, upon the clarity of the description.

The ICZN has existed only since 1961, when the first edition of the Code was published. The ICZN does not always demand a type specimen for the historical validity of a species, and many "type-less" species do exist. The current edition of the Code, Article 75.3, prohibits the designation of a [[neotype]] unless there is "an exceptional need" for "clarifying the taxonomic status" of a species (Article 75.2).

There are many other permutations and variations on terms using the suffix "-type" (e.g., [[allotype (nomenclature)|allotype]], cotype, [[topotype]], [[generitype]], [[isotype (biology)|isotype]], isoneotype, isolectotype, etc.) but these are not formally regulated by the Code, and a great many are obsolete and/or idiosyncratic. However, some of these categories can potentially apply to genuine type specimens, such as a neotype; e.g., isotypic/topotypic specimens are preferred to other specimens, when they are available at the time a neotype is chosen (because they are from the same time and/or place as the original type).

The term fixation is used by the Code for the declaration of a name-bearing type, whether by original or subsequent designation.

===Type species===
{{Main|Type species}}
[[File:Bufo bufo (Marek Szczepanek).jpg|thumb|The [[common toad]], ''Bufo bufo'' described by [[Linnaeus]], is the type species for the genus ''[[Bufo]]'']]
Each genus must have a designated type species (the term "genotype" was once used for this but has been abandoned because the word has become much better known as the term for [[genotype|a different concept]] in [[genetics]]). The description of a genus is usually based primarily on its type species, modified and expanded by the features of other included species. The generic name is permanently associated with the name-bearing type of its type species.

Ideally, a type species best exemplifies the essential characteristics of the genus to which it belongs, but this is subjective and, ultimately, technically irrelevant, as it is not a requirement of the Code. If the type species proves, upon closer examination, to belong to a pre-existing genus (a common occurrence), then all of the constituent species must be either moved into the pre-existing genus, or disassociated from the original type species and given a new generic name; the old generic name passes into synonymy and is abandoned unless there is a pressing need to make an exception (decided case-by-case, via petition to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature).{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Type genus===
{{Main|Type genus}}
A type genus is that genus from which the name of a [[family (biology)|family]] or subfamily is formed. As with type species, the type genus is not necessarily the most representative, but is usually the earliest described, largest or best known genus. It is not uncommon for the name of a family to be based upon the name of a type genus that has passed into synonymy; the family name does not need to be changed in such a situation.

==Research methods==
The distance is calculated between pairs of samples (each sample represents an organismal community). All taxa found in one or both samples are placed on a phylogenetic tree. A branch leading to taxa from both samples is marked as "shared" and branches leading to taxa which appears only in one sample are marked as "unshared". The distance between the two samples is then calculated as (the sum of "unshared" branch lengths)/(the sum of all tree branch lengths (= shared+unshared)), i.e. the fraction of total branch length which is unshared. This definition satisfies the requirements of a [[distance metric]], being non-negative, zero only when entities are identical, transitive, and conformant to the [[triangle inequality]].

If there are several different samples, a distance matrix can be created, by making a tree for each pair of samples and calculating their UniFrac measure. Later, standard multivariate statistical methods such as [[data clustering]] and [[principal co-ordinates analysis]] can be used.

One can determine the statistical significance of the Unifrac distance between two  samples using [[Monte Carlo simulation]]s. By randomizing the sample classification of each taxa on the tree (leaving the branch structure unchanged) and creating a distribution of UniFrac distance values, one can obtain a distribution of UniFrac values. From this, a p-value can be given to the actual distance between the samples.

Additionally, there is a weighted version of the UniFrac metric which accounts for the relative abundance of each of the taxa within the communities. This is commonly used in [[metagenomic]] studies, where the number of metagenomic reads can be in the tens of thousands, and it is appropriate to 'bin' these reads into [[operational taxonomic unit]]s, or OTUs, which can then be dealt with as taxa within the UniFrac framework.

In 2012, a generalized UniFrac version,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which unifies the weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance in a single framework, was proposed.  The weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance place too much weight on either abundant lineages or rare lineages. Their power to detect environmental influence is limited under some setting, where the moderately abundant lineages are mostly affected. The generalized UniFrac distance corrects the limitation of the weighted/weighted UniFrac distance by down-weighting their emphasis on either abundant or rare lineages.
