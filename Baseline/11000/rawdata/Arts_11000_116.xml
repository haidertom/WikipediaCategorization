'''''The Adoration of the Magi'''''  is an [[oil painting]] on wood panel by [[Netherlandish art|Netherlandish]] artist [[Hieronymus Bosch]], executed around 1475. It is housed in the [[Metropolitan Museum, New York]], US. A prominent feature of this painting is the strong perspective effect&lt;ref&gt;M. Ilsink and J. Koldeweij, Hieronymus Bosch, Visions of Genius, Yale University Press 2016, pp.58-61&lt;/ref&gt; and also the copious use of [[gold leaf]] which is not very typical for Bosch.&lt;ref&gt;Luuk Hoogstede, Ron Spronk, Matthijs Ilsink, Robert G. Erdmann, Jos Koldeweij, Rik Klein Gotink, Hieronymus Bosch, Painter and Draughtsman: Technical Studies, Yale University Press, 2016, pp. 172 – 181&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pigments]] employed are red lake, [[azurite]], [[lead-tin-yellow]] and [[ochres]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/project/hieronymus-bosch-adoration-magi-new-york/ Hieronymus Bosch, The Adoration of the Magi (New York)], ColourLex&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise authorship of this panel is and has been disputed, but in 2016 the Bosch Research and Conservation Project attributed it to Bosch based on evidence in the underdrawing.

'''''Argenteuil Basin with a Single Sailboat''''' is an oil on canvas autumn scene of the basin at [[Argenteuil]], painted by French [[Impressionist]] artist [[Claude Monet]] in 1874.&lt;ref name=NationalGallery&gt;{{cite web |title=Argenteuil Basin with a Single Sailboat |publisher=National Gallery of Ireland |url=http://www.nationalgallery.ie/en/Learning/Schools/Impressionism/Works/Monet.aspx |accessdate= 18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
The piece was created during Monet's residence at Argenteuil, a town on the banks of the [[Seine]], on the outskirts of [[Paris]]. Here Monet purchased a boat to be used as a floating studio and painted many scenes of the surrounding area.&lt;ref name=NationalGallery/&gt;

==National Gallery of Ireland==
The painting was purchased by Irish playwright and activist [[Edward Martyn]] in 1899, on the advice of his cousin, [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]]. It was bequeathed to the National Gallery of Ireland in 1924.&lt;ref name=eMuseum&gt;{{cite web |title=eMuseum |publisher=National Gallery of Ireland |url=http://onlinecollection.nationalgallery.ie/view/objects/asitem/248/8/sortNumber-asc;jsessionid=4BCA839B5403A418978E44A004E02E20?t:state:flow=381a6dc7-ab82-4f53-a387-54626eb55ea1 |accessdate= 18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is valued at €10m.&lt;ref name=RteRestore&gt;{{cite web |title=Restored Monet returned to National Gallery| publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/0701/627635-monet-national-gallery/ |date= 1 July 2014 |accessdate= 18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vandalism and restoration===
At around 11am on 29 June 2012 a visitor to the gallery, Andrew Shannon, punched the painting causing "huge damage, shocking damage"&lt;ref name=BelfastRestore&gt;{{cite web |title=Vandalised Monet work restored| publisher=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/republic-of-ireland/vandalised-monet-work-restored-30397673.html |date= 1 July 2014 |accessdate= 18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with "an extensive three-branched tear".&lt;ref name=NationalGalleryRestore&gt;{{cite web |title=The Claude Monet Research &amp; Conservation Project | publisher=National Gallery of Ireland|url=http://www.nationalgallery.ie/en/Learning/Schools/Impressionism/Conservation_Project.aspx |accessdate= 18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 18 months of restoration work, on 1 July 2014, the painting was re-hung in the gallery, behind protective glass.&lt;ref name=RteRestore/&gt; The restoration saw 7% of the damaged area being lost, in a process that involved sewing microscopic threads back together.&lt;ref name=BelfastRestore/&gt;

Shannon was jailed for 5 years for the attack.&lt;ref name=MetroJailed&gt;{{cite web |last=Wheaton |first=Oliver |title=Man is jailed for punching a hole through an £8 million Monet painting

'''BET Soul''' is an [[United States|American]] [[pay television]] [[television network|network]] that is controlled by the [[BET Networks]] division of [[Viacom]], which owns the network. The channel showcases [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]], [[funk]], [[soul music|soul]], [[neo soul]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[jazz music|jazz]] and [[Motown]] music from various decades.

Originating as '''VH1 Soul''', a spinoff of [[VH1]], the channel moved under the editorial control of [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] on December 28, 2015 as part of Viacom's ongoing restructuring of their pay-TV operations.

==History==
The channel, which was originally a commercial-free service, debuted on May 8, 2000 with [[VH1 Classic]] as part of the "MTV Digital Suite" of [[digital cable]] channels, which was sold solely to cable providers to give them an advantage over satellite services. In its early years, VH1 Soul's main focus was on R&amp;B and soul videos of the late 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, along with live performance clips from even earlier years. [[Janet Jackson]], [[Prince (artist)|Prince]], [[TLC (band)|TLC]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], [[Tony Toni Tone]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Patti LaBelle]] and [[Stevie Wonder]] were some of the channel's main staples. By 2003, the channel had stopped showing most of the pre-1990s videos, since these were often played on VH1 Classic's ''[[Classic Soul]]'' program. The channel then gradually began to focus more on underground, alternative, and [[old school hip hop|old school]] hip-hop videos, while continuing to feature new R&amp;B musicians.

On February 1, 2006, VH1 Soul revamped its format, discontinuing with the model of running videos randomly and instead airing videos on different genre-based music shows, though a basic 'wheel schedule' structure remained, and does so to this day.

In the spring of 2007, VH1 Soul, along with its sister networks [[BET Jams|MTV Jams]] and [[NickMusic|MTV Hits]], were briefly dropped from [[Time Warner Cable]]'s Southern California systems that were formerly operated by [[Adelphia Communications|Adelphia]] and [[Comcast]]. However, all three channels returned to TWC within a couple of months, under a new, specialized service tier. To date, however, the three networks remain conspicuously absent from many of Time Warner Cable and [[Bright House Networks]]' systems, most notably in New York City. Even as the 'Digital Suite' concept was discontinued, the network has never been offered to [[DirecTV]] or [[Dish Network]].

[[File:VH1 Soul.svg|thumb|Second logo as VH1 Soul, 2006-2015|120px|right]]

The final edition of the [[Vibe Awards]] aired on the channel in November 2007, after a one-year hiatus due to the merger of [[The WB]] and [[UPN]] into [[The CW]].

For a short time from 2008 until 2009 the network aired non music video programming in some time slots, including [[VH1]]'s ''[[The Salt-n-Pepa Show]]'', along with the documentary ''[[Black to the Future]]'' as part of the network's February 2009 [[Black History Month]] programming, along with out-of-format programming such as ''VH1 [[Hip Hop Honors]] Show'', ''[[VH1 Rock Docs]]'', and other programming from its ''Celebreality'' strand of original programming. Viewer complaints that resulted from the programming substitutions soon overwhelmed VH1's management, along with other complaints for sister network [[VH1 Classic]] straying from its own mission. Soon, VH1 moved away from out-of-format programming on both channels, and by late 2009, VH1 Soul resumed a 24/7 video format.

Presently, a selection of R&amp;B hits from the past ten years, as well as several 1980s and early 1990s hip-hop videos, can be seen on VH1 Soul. Several of the more R&amp;B-influenced modern-day rappers and their newest videos can also be regularly seen in heavy rotation on VH1 Soul; for example: [[The Roots]], [[De La Soul]], [[Kanye West]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], and [[Talib Kweli]]. However, VH1 Soul still occasionally airs older 1980s or early 1990s R&amp;B/soul hits, such as Prince's "Kiss", [[Mariah Carey]]'s "Vision Of Love", Stevie Wonder's "Superstition", or [[Chaka Khan]]'s "I Feel For You". The network restored commercials on January 1, 2011.

On December 28, 2015, the channel was given over to BET Networks as part of the continuing reorganization of Viacom's assets due to ratings and financial issues in 2015, an issue that had already resulted in BET Networks taking editorial control of the former [[BET Jams|MTV Jams]] two months before. The network was rebranded as '''BET Soul''' on that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bet.com/news/music/2015/12/28/vh1-soul-to-become-bet-soul.html|title=VH1 Soul to Become BET Soul The 24-hour music video channel to make big switch today.|last=Chapman Jr.|first=George|date=28 December 2015|publisher=[[BET Networks]]|accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, 18-year-old [[Scott Thorson]] ([[Matt Damon]]), who works as an [[Animal training|animal trainer]] for films, meets Bob Black ([[Scott Bakula]]), a Hollywood producer, in a gay bar in Los Angeles.  At Black's urging, he leaves his adopted home in search of better-paying work.  Black introduces Thorson to [[Liberace]] ([[Michael Douglas]]), who takes an immediate liking to the handsome younger man.  Liberace invites the two backstage and then to his luxurious home in Las Vegas.  Thorson observes that one of Liberace's beloved dogs is suffering from a temporary form of blindness, and with his veterinary assistant background, informs the famous pianist that he knows how to cure the condition.  After treating the dog, Thorson becomes Liberace's "assistant" at the performer's request. Thorson also becomes employed as Liberace's stage chauffeur, driving a Rolls-Royce limousine onto the stage for Liberace's grand entrances.

Thorson moves in with Liberace and becomes his lover.  At this point, Thorson says that he is [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] because he is also attracted to women.  Liberace is sympathetic, informing him that he wanted and tried to love women, but was exclusively attracted to men.  He relates a story of a "divine healing" in which a "messenger" informed him that God still loved him.

It gradually becomes clear that Liberace is trying to mold Thorson into a younger version of himself.  He asks his plastic surgeon, Dr. Jack Startz ([[Rob Lowe]]), to transform Scott's face to more closely resemble his own and makes an unsuccessful attempt to formally adopt him.  Thorson soon turns to drugs as he becomes more angry and frustrated with Liberace trying to control him as well as Liberace's obsession to publicly hide their romance at any cost.

By 1982, Thorson's increasing drug abuse and Liberace's interest in younger men, including dancer Cary James ([[Boyd Holbrook]]), creates a rift that ultimately destroys their relationship.  When Liberace begins visiting pornographic peep shows and suggests that they each see other people, Thorson becomes upset.  Thorson retains an attorney to seek his financial share of the property by suing Liberace for over $100,000,000 in [[palimony]].  As a result, Liberace ends their formal partnership and involves himself with his most recent, and much younger, "assistant".  In 1984, Thorson's palimony lawsuit starts where he gives details about his five-year romance with the entertainer, while Liberace flatly denies any sexual relationship.

Not long thereafter, in December 1986, Thorson receives a phone call from Liberace telling him that he is very sick with what is later revealed to be [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] and that he would like Thorson to visit him again.  Thorson agrees and drives to Liberace's retreat house in Palm Springs, where he and Liberace have one last, emotional conversation. Liberace dies a few months later in February 1987.  Thorson attends Liberace's funeral, in which he imagines seeing Liberace performing one last time with his traditional flamboyance, before being lifted to Heaven with a stage harness.

==Production==
[[File:Liberace's rhinestone car TWC jeh.jpg|thumb|Car used in the production]]

Director [[Steven Soderbergh]] first spoke with [[Michael Douglas]] about the idea of doing a [[Liberace]] film during the production of'' [[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]'' (2000), but had trouble figuring out an angle for it that would differentiate it from a traditional biopic.&lt;ref name="OAAN"&gt;{{cite web|last=Azzopardi|first=Chris|title=Behind the ‘Candelabra’|url=http://www.outandaboutnashville.com/story/behind-candelabra|publisher=Out &amp; About Nashville|accessdate=June 2, 2013|date=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2008, Soderbergh contacted screenwriter [[Richard LaGravenese]] with the idea of adapting [[Scott Thorson]]'s memoir ''[[Behind the Candelabra: My Life with Liberace]]''.&lt;ref name="collider"&gt;{{cite web |last= Radish |first= Christina |title= Richard LaGravenese Talks BEHIND THE CANDELABRA, Signing on to the Film, Input from Matt Damon and Michael Douglas &amp; Working with Steven Soderbergh |url= http://collider.com/richard-lagravenese-behind-the-candelabra-interview/ |publisher= Collider.com |accessdate = June 1, 2013 |date= May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, the project was officially announced with [[Matt Damon]] close to signing on to play Thorson and Douglas in talks to portray Liberace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Chen |first= David |title= Soderbergh To Direct "Liberace" Biopic, Michael Douglas To Play Lead |url= http://www.slashfilm.com/soderbergh-to-direct-liberace-biopic-michael-douglas-to-play-lead/ |publisher= [[/Film]] |accessdate= June 1, 2013 |date= September 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the film crew position|the documentary film|Best Boy (film)}}
In a [[film crew]] there are two kinds of '''best boy''':  '''best boy electric''' and '''best boy grip'''. They are assistants to their department heads, the [[Gaffer (filmmaking)|gaffer]] (in charge of electricals) and the [[key grip]] (lighting and rigging), respectively.&lt;ref name="Taub153"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gaffers, Grips, and Best Boys |last=Taub |first=Eric |year=1994 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=New York |isbn=0-312-11276-9 |page=153 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, the best boy acts as the [[Construction foreman|foreman]] for his department. A woman who performs the duties of a best boy may be called '''best girl'''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Being Human (North American TV series)|Being Human]]'' end credits, for example&lt;/ref&gt;

== Job responsibilities ==
Best boys  are responsible for the day-to-day operation of the lighting or grip department. Their many responsibilities include the hiring, scheduling, and management of crew; the renting, ordering, inventory, and returning of equipment; workplace safety and maintaining discipline within their department; completing timecards and other paperwork; stocking of expendables; loading and unloading production trucks; planning and implementing the lighting or rigging of locations and/or sound stages; coordinating with rigging crews and additional photography units (if applicable); handling relations with the other production departments; overseeing the application of union rules (where relevant); and serving as the day-to-day representative of the department with the [[unit production manager]] and coordinator of their department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativeskillset.org/film/jobs/lighting/article_3893_2.asp|title=Film job profiles/best boy|publisher=creativeskillset.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best boy also commonly accompanies or stands in for the key grip or gaffer during technical scouts. During shooting, the best boy may also cover for the key grip or gaffer when he or she is on break or otherwise away from the set.

On films with very small crews, the electric (lighting) department often consists of only a gaffer, a best boy, and a few [[lighting technician#Film lighting technician|electrician]]s. The grip department may include only a key grip, a best boy, and a few [[grip (job)|grip]]s. Large-scale productions such as [[Major film studio|major]] films commonly include full-time rigging and [[second unit]] crews, and in total may hire many dozens of grips or electricians at one time.

== Etymology ==
It's unclear why this term came to be used as a job title on film sets. As OED says, "It has been suggested that it originated as a term for a master's most able apprentice, or alternatively that it was transferred from earlier use for a member of a ship's crew, but confirmatory evidence for either of these theories appears to be lacking."{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The earliest known appearance of the phrase in print is 1931 from the ''Albuquerque Journal'': "Among the electricians .. the department head is the gaffer, his first assistant is the best boy."{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

As the gaffer is sometimes credited as the chief lighting technician, the best boy electric is sometimes credited as the '''assistant chief lighting technician'''.

The title is accepted for use in credits by the BBC.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/tv/production/credit-guidelines.shtml|title=Full Credit Guidance|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end credits of the 1980 comedy film ''[[Airplane!]]'' named the Best Boy, then the next line was "Worst Boy", naming [[Adolf Hitler]] in that position.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080339/crazycredits.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage outside English ==
Many [[French language]] films made in [[Canada]] use ''Best Boy'' in the credits. The term has been known to appear in the credits of some French films made in [[France]], but it has not been known to appear in [[Belgium|Belgian]] or [[Switzerland|Swiss]] films.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

The [[Germany|German]] film ''Auf der anderen Seite'' (''[[The Edge of Heaven (film)|The Edge of Heaven]]''), which takes place in [[Germany]] and [[Turkey]], uses the term ''Best Boy'' in its German credits. German TV and film crews regularly use the term, because no equivalent phrase exists in German.

The '''Cape Performing Arts Board''' (CAPAB) was a [[South African]] theatre organisation based in [[Cape Town]], serving the former [[Cape Province]]. It was one of the four state funded performing arts councils in the four former provinces of South Africa instituted in 1963.

== History ==

In 1961 the National Theatre Organisation was disbanded and replaced by four provincial performing arts councils. In Cape Town the Cape Performing Arts Board (CAPAB) was instituted in 1962 with the aim to promote the performing arts in the Cape Province and South Arica. The arts councils received sufficient government subsidies to fund various art forms as well as the operational requirements of the theatre facilities. Staff could be taken into permanent employment.

== Demise ==

Since 1994 government policy changed dramatically. All performing arts boards were transformed to managers of playhouses and the various arts companies had to become independent. The CAPAB Drama Department staged its last production in May 1997 with a final performance of [[David Mowat]]'s ''The Guise'', a play which has as its theme the survival of the theatre.

The new organisation, Artscape, was launched on 27 March 1999 to replace CAPAB and the Nico Malan Theatre Complex was renamed the [[Artscape Theatre Centre]].

== Nico Malan Theatre Centre ==

The Nico Malan Theatre Centre was opened on 19 May 1971, to be programmed and managed by Cape Performing Arts Board as a production house with four arts companies – orchestra, opera, ballet and drama. These companies had full-time artistes, technical and administrative staff.

In line with the new South African the political dispensation and the concurrent changes, the complex was renamed the [[Artscape Theatre Centre]] in March 2001.

CAPE PERFORMING ARTS BOARD (CAPAB) (Afrikaans: Kaaplandse Raad vir die Uitvoerende Kunste – KRUIK). Founded in 1963, after the dissolving of the National Theatre Organisation, with Danie van Eeden*?? as its first director. (He was followed consecutively by Gé Korsten, George Loopuyt and Michael  Maas.)  Registered as a society not for gain, it was headed by a policy-making council chaired by the provincial administrator and representative of all interested parties, including the province, the city municipality of Cape Town, the department of national education,  the business sector as well as representatives of the various performing art forms. Their function was to provide artists and artisans with a secure career option, to develop and promote drama, ballet, music and opera by offering audiences in the province with regular professional productions. Its first productions were Becket (Anouilh) and Hedda Gabler (Ibsen, in Afrikaans) in the Hofmeyr Theatre in November 1963. Their first opera (The Bartered Bride by Smetana) was done on 8 February 1965 in the Alhambra Theatre.  Their first indigenous in play Afrikaans was *** in 196*, while the first indigenous English play was The Year of the Locust by James Ambrose Brown (1966).  Initially renting theatres in the various cities, CAPAB purchased the Opera House in Port Elizabeth in 1967, and refurbished it for use as a base for their work in the Eastern Cape. In 1971 they opened the Nico Malan Theatre Complex in Cape Town, The Opera House with a performance of the ballet Sylvia, and the Theatre with a controversial [Presidential] opening production, "KONING LEAR" [Uys Krige] - directed by Dieter Reible, ["Christine" - Barto Smit was also scheduled, but banned before rehearsals commenced due to subject matter].    Feydeau's "Hond Se Gedagte" [A Flea in her Ear'] also directed by Dieter Reible followed 'Lear'.

 The opening of this theatre "for whites only" – despite the protests of artists, critics and many of the population – was to be one of the most troublesome issues for the council over the next twenty years, as it was actively boycotted by the Cape non-white population as well as their supporters. It was belatedly opened for all on 21 February 1975, but this had little effect on the boycott, which lasted for many more years. In 1972  a third venue, the Arena, was builtin a large rehearsal room, to house the work of CAPAB;'s experimental company [Aubrey berg's production of Hofmann's "The Burgomaster"]. The first head of drama was the long serving  Pieter Fourie, followed by Johan Esterhuizen in 19**, and later by***.  CAPAB also had a very successful youth company, founded to do educational work and  originally led by Robin Malan*? Followed over the years by i.a. Eileen Thorns, ** and Ivan Abrahams  and. .  the     CAPAB:Cape Provincial Arts Board. . Together with PACT and the Phoenix Players, they staged Athol Fugard’s Boesman and Lena and People are Living There, both directed by Fugard and starring Yvonne Bryceland and Glyn Day in 1970. Peter Curtis and Pieter Fourie ran this drama company circa 1971. They staged their plays at the old Hofmeyr Theatre. They acquired their own theatre and opera house in 1971 in the form of the Nico Malan. The Nico’s first performance in front of an integrated audience, the Academy Theatres’ Who Saw Him Die took place on 21 February 1975. Their production of Dalene Matthee’s Fiela se Kind starring Shaleen Surtie-Richards was staged at the Nico Malan in 1986. Basil Rubin in association with CAPAB staged William Luce’s Zelda at the Adcock-Ingram in August 1987. Together with Volute Productions they staged Robert Hewett’s Gulls which Keith Grenville directed in 1987. Together with the other three performing arts councils they staged The Great Walt for their Christmas production in 1987 and Singin’ in the Rain for their Christmas production in 1988. They staged My Fair Lady in 1989/90. They presented Michael Drinn’s The Phantom of the Opera in 1990. Together with  PACT, the [[Johannesburg Civic Theatre]] Association and NAPAC they presented A Chorus Line in 1992. Together with NAPAC and PACOFS they presented Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma! in 1993. **** (Tucker, 1997) CAPE PERFORMING ARTS BOARD (CAPAB) (****-****).  Cape Town.  Chris Swart was the director (from 19** to 19**), Peter Curtis the artistic director of English drama(from 19** to 19**) and Pieter Fourie the artistic director of Afrikaans drama (from 19** to 19**).

'''''China Gate''''' is a 1957 [[Hollywood]] [[CinemaScope]] [[war film]] written, produced and directed by [[Samuel Fuller]] and released through [[20th Century Fox]].

==Plot==
Sergeant Brock ([[Gene Barry]]) and Goldie ([[Nat King Cole]]) are American [[Korean War]] veterans now serving as [[French Foreign Legion]] mercenaries in the [[First Indochina War]]. Brock's wife, a "half caste" Chinese [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] named "Lucky Legs" ([[Angie Dickinson]]) who resorts to smuggling to feed her five-year-old son ([[Warren Hsieh]]) she had with Brock. Brock abandoned her and the baby when he was born with Asian features, feeling a "half breed" would not be welcome in America; an attitude towards miscegenation prevalent at the time. Lucky is recruited by the French high command to use her expert knowledge of the area and her friendship with the communist Major Cham ([[Lee Van Cleef]]) to get a demolition squad of Legionnaires led by Brock to a vital hidden [[Viet Minh]] ammunition dump on the border with [[People's Republic of China|Red China]]. In return for her services, Lucky is promised by the French that they will arrange for her son's emigration to America.

The raid is filled with animosity between the former lovers, booby traps, and enemy patrols.  On arrival at the ammunition dump hidden in a mountain, Lucky discovers the commanding officer is her former friend Major Cham, who wants to take her and her son to a new life in [[Moscow]]. Cham is a high flyer corporate executive (in the manner of Fuller's gangsters in ''[[Underworld USA]]'')  marked for great things in the world of international [[communism]]. The sabotage mission is successful but at great cost; Lucky dies blowing up the dump. Brock reconciles with his child and is last seen walking along holding his hand in preparation for returning to America, as Goldie reprises the title song.

==Production==
Fuller selected singer Cole after being impressed with his face on a record [[album cover]].  Though [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] said Cole received more money in a few weeks than the entire budget of the film, Fuller arranged to meet Cole. Cole and his wife were interested in Goldie as an opposite to the racist Brock and agreed to work at a minimum salary. ''China Gate'' was the last score [[Victor Young]] composed; the film was finished by his friend [[Max Steiner]]. [[Harold Adamson]] wrote lyrics to Young's beautiful theme for the film.  Though originally not intending to sing in the film, Cole sang ''China Gate'' as he walked through a bombed out village followed by Brock's little son, making it a memorable tune and a fitting tribute to Young.

An actual [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] actress playing a [[love interest]] opposite a white European star was a rarity in [[Hollywood]] at the time. Dickinson proves attractive to Brock, and to mainstream audiences of the time. Her character is allowed to express Fuller's view on [[race relations]] and is respected both by the French military and by a local [[priest]] whose life she had saved. (The character takes a role similar to Fuller's [[prostitute]] [[protagonist]]s in ''[[Pickup on South Street]]'' and ''[[The Naked Kiss]]''). The dangerous [[patrol]] allows for a gradual change of heart for Brock.

==Banned in France==
Before ''China Gate'' was to be released, Fuller received a call from the French [[Consul-General]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Romain Gary]], inviting him to lunch. Gary said the film's prologue was too harsh towards France and asked Fuller to change it. Fuller refused, but the two became firm friends with similar interests. The film was never released in France.

Many years later, Fuller filmed a story of Gary's, ''[[White Dog]]'' (1982), that Fuller and [[Curtis Hanson]] adapted for the screen.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, Samuel. ''A Third Face'', Alfred A Knopf, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video releases==
''China Gate'' was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc by Mongrel Media on March 26, 2013.

In [[Late Antiquity]], a '''consular diptych''' was a type of [[diptych]] intended as a de-luxe commemorative object. The diptychs were generally in ivory, wood or metal and decorated with rich [[relief sculpture]]. A consular diptych was commissioned by a [[Roman consul#Under the Empire|''consul ordinarius'']]  to mark his entry to that post, and was distributed as a commemorative reward to those who had supported his candidature or might support him in future.&lt;ref&gt;p178.

==History==

===Origins===
From as early as the first century CE, some formal letters of appointment to office were known as [[Codex|"codicilli", little books]], two or more flat pieces of (usually) wood, joined by clasps, lined with wax on which was written the letter of appointment. Later, the letter might be written on papyrus and presented within the covers. By the late fourth century, however, specially-commissioned diptychs began to be included among the gifts that appointees to high office distributed to celebrate and publicize the public games that were their principal duties.&lt;ref&gt;p. 182. The origin, context, and function of consular diptychs. Alan Cameron, in memory of Tally Kampen. Journal of Roman Studies 103 (2013) pp. 174–207.&lt;/ref&gt; These diptychs were made of ivory, with relief carvings on the outside chosen by the donor, looking superficially similar to codicils but containing no writing and with no official status.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 185–194. The origin, context, and function of consular diptychs. Alan Cameron, in memory of Tally Kampen. Journal of Roman Studies 103 (2013) pp. 174–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

The routine distribution of such diptychs in the East is marked by a decision by [[Theodosius I]] in 384 to limit expenditure on the games of Constantinople by reserving ivory diptychs (and golden gifts) to consuls alone.&lt;ref&gt;Cod. Theod.
15.9.1, p. 181 of The origin, context, and function of consular diptychs. Alan Cameron, in memory of Tally Kampen. Journal of Roman Studies 103 (2013) pp. 174–207.&lt;/ref&gt; In the western empire, they became a usual part of the public displays given by great aristocrats. [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus]], for example, distributed some to commemorate his son's [[quaestor]]ian games in 393 and [[praetor]]ian games in 401 respectively. Almost all depict the games, and on three separate occasions Symmachus links the presentation of these diptychs with the completion of the games.&lt;ref&gt;p. 182 of: The origin, context, and function of consular diptychs. Alan Cameron, in memory of Tally Kampen. Journal of Roman Studies 103 (2013) pp. 174–207.&lt;/ref&gt; Their end is marked by the consulship's disappearance under the reign of [[Justinian]] in 541. 
[[File:Magnus.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Consular diptych of [[Magnus (consul 518)|Magnus]], who was consul of [[Constantinople]] in 518. He sits between figures representing Rome and Constantinople. [[Louvre]]]]

The oldest diptych that can properly be called a consular diptych, held in the [[cathedral treasury]] at [[Aosta]], is one commissioned by Anicius Petronius Probus, consul in the Western Empire in 406 – it is unique not only for its extreme antiquity but also as the only one to bear the portrait of the Emperor ([[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] in this instance, to whom the diptych is dedicated in an inscription full of humility, with Probus calling himself the emperor's "[[Wikt:famulus|famulus]]" or slave) rather than that of the consul.

Later, consular diptychs systematically carried either a more or less elaborate portrait of the consul on the most richly decorated examples or a dedicatory inscription to him within a geometric and vegetal scheme on the simpler examples.  The simpler examples were probably produced as a series from models prepared in advance, with the more sophisticated (and thus more expensive) diptychs reserved for the inner circle of the Roman aristocracy.  The workshops responsible for their production were to be found in the Empire's two capitals at [[Rome]] and [[Constantinople]], but the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in 476 was probably responsible for the disappearance of western production at the end of the 5th century, with all surviving consular diptychs from the 6th century originating from Constantinople.  The most common motif on 6th century consular diptychs from Constantinople shows the consul, standing, presiding over the consular games which marked his entry to the consulship.

By their very nature, consular diptychs are a valuable tool for the [[prosopography]] of the late Roman Empire as well as for the study of the art of this period.  Large numbers of them have survived to the present day, in many cases due to their re-use as book covers for medieval ecclesiastical manuscripts.  Some were also used in churches as grand bindings for lists of bishops and similar records.&lt;ref&gt;''Medieval Italy, an Encyclopedia'', p. 566, Christopher Kleinhenz ed. Routledge, 2004, {{ISBN|0-415-93930-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-93930-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Barberini Ivory]] is a much rarer Imperial diptych, probably of [[Justinian]].

'''Cooties''' is a fictitious childhood disease, used in the United States and Canada as a rejection term and an infection [[Tag (game)|tag game]] (such as [[Humans vs. Zombies]]).  It is similar to the British [[dreaded lurgi]], and to terms used in the [[Nordic countries]], in Italy, Australia and  New Zealand.&lt;ref name=Bronner/&gt;  A child is said to "catch" cooties through close contact with an "infected" person or from an opposite-sex child of a similar age.

==Origin==
The word is thought to originate from the [[Austronesian language family]], in which the [[Philippine languages]], [[Māori language|Maori]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/cooties |title=Definition of cootie |publisher=Collins English Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]]-[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] word ''kutu'' refers to a parasitic biting insect.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded uses of the term in English are by British soldiers during the [[First World War]] to refer to [[lice]] that proliferated in battlefield trenches.&lt;ref name=Origin&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FMqoJdAZjvQC&amp;pg=PA213#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Explaining Traditions: Folk Behavior in Modern Culture | author=Simon Bronner |page=213 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |date= 26 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Got Cooties?

A hand-held game, the ''Cootie Game'', was made by the Irvin-Smith Company of Chicago in 1915; it involved tilting capsules (the cooties) into a trap over a background illustration depicting a  battlefield.&lt;ref name=Walsh&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jftapGDTmYUC&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=78|title=Timeless Toys|author=Tim Walsh|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|date= 1 Oct 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cootie games followed, all involving some form of bug or cootie,&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; until [[The Game of Cootie]] was launched in 1948 by [[Schaper Toys]].&lt;ref name=Game&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jftapGDTmYUC&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=77|title=Timeless Toys|author=Tim Walsh|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|date= 1 Oct 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This game was very successful, becoming an icon;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jftapGDTmYUC&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=79|title=Timeless Toys|author=Tim Walsh|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|date= 1 Oct 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2003, the [[Toy Industry Association]] included it on its "Century of Toys List" of the 100 most memorable and most creative toys of the 20th century.

In addition to the cooties games, the term ''cooties'' was popularised in America in the 1950s by military personnel coming back from service alongside the British in the South Pacific.&lt;ref name=Origin/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sue1980"&gt;{{cite journal|date=July 1980|title=The Cooties Complex|journal=Western Folklore|volume=39|issue=3, Children's Folklore|pages=198–210|doi=10.2307/1499801|jstor=1499801|oclc=50529929|author=Sue Samuelson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the British dreaded lurgi, the cooties games developed during the early 1950s [[polio]] epidemic, and became associated with dirt and contagion.&lt;ref name=Bronner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cooties&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FMqoJdAZjvQC&amp;pg=PA214#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Explaining Traditions: Folk Behavior in Modern Culture | author=Simon Bronner |page=214 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |date= 26 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other terms==
The lice of the [[Trench warfare#World War I: Entrenchment|First World War trenches]] nicknamed "cooties" were also known as "arithmetic bugs" because "they added to our troubles, subtracted from our pleasures, divided our attention, and multiplied like hell."&lt;ref&gt;

In [[Serbia]] the game is known as "šuga"; the word means [[scabies]].

==Cooties game==
A child is said to "catch" cooties through any form of bodily contact, proximity, or touching of an "infected" person or from a person of the opposite sex of the same age. Often the "infected" person is someone who is perceived as different, due to disability, shyness, being of the opposite sex, or having peculiar mannerisms.&lt;ref name="public.oed.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public.oed.com/appeals/cootie/|title=Appeals: cootie &amp;#124; Oxford English Dictionary|date=|publisher=Public.oed.com|accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase is most commonly used by children in elementary school aged 4-10; however, it may be used by older children in a sarcastic or playful way.&lt;ref name="Sue1980"/&gt; Sometimes the phrase specifies the type of cooties, as in "''you've got girl cooties!''" or "''you've got boy cooties!''" after a child has been touched by or in other ways interacted with a child of the opposite sex.

In the United States, children sometimes "immunize" one another from cooties by administering a "cootie injection".&lt;ref name=Origin/&gt; Typically, one child administers the "shot", using an index finger to trace circles and dots on another child's forearm while reciting the rhyme, "Circle, circle, Dot, dot,  – Now you've got the cootie shot!" In some variations, a child then says, "Circle, circle, Square, square, – Now you have it everywhere!" In this case, the child receives an immunization throughout his or her body. These variations may continue to a final shot where the child says, "Circle, circle, Knife, knife,  – Now you've got it all your life!". A number of other variations exist.

[[File:20070530 Bronze cow cast.JPG|thumb|right|Bronze casting commemorating Chicago's exhibition]]

'''CowParade''' is an international [[public art]] exhibit that has featured in major world cities. [[Fiberglass]] sculptures of cows are decorated by local artists, and distributed over the city centre, in public places such as train stations, important avenues, and parks. They often feature artwork and designs specific to local culture, as well as city life and other relevant themes.

After the exhibition in the city, which may last many months, the statues are auctioned off and the proceeds donated to charity.

There are a few variations of shape, but the three most common shapes of cow were created by Pascal Knapp, a [[Switzerland|Swiss-born]] sculptor who was commissioned to create the cows specifically for the CowParade series of events. Pascal Knapp owns the copyrights to the standing, lying, and grazing cow shapes used in the CowParade events.

==History==
The concept of "cow parade" has its origins in [[Zürich]], Switzerland, in 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://switzerland.isyours.com/e/photo-gallery/geneva/parade-cows.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509065640/http://switzerland.isyours.com/e/photo-gallery/geneva/parade-cows.html |archivedate=May 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by artistic director Walter Knapp, it is based on an idea which was realised in the same city for the first time in 1986: Lions as the symbol of Zurich were painted and then on display throughout the city.

The Zürich exhibit 1998 was not called "cow parade" - it was called '''Land in Sicht''' (roughly translated as "Countryside in view").{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The concept was brought to the United States when [[Chicago]] businessman Peter Hanig, along with Commissioner of Cultural Affairs [[Lois Weisberg]], organized an event in Chicago in 1999 called '''Cows on Parade'''. A Swiss company, CowHolding Parade AG, started to explore the idea.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The American company capitalizing on this idea, CowHolding Parade, was founded in 1999; the Swiss company promptly sued but the case fizzled out without results.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} A bronze casting of one of the cows is on permanent display in Chicago in commemoration of the city's initial exhibition.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The success of this venture inspired many other cities to host similar [[fundraising]] projects. The idea has been taken up by other cities which have chosen animals for public art projects with painted fiberglass sculptures (see [[#Similar projects|Similar projects]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Criticism==
CowParade has been criticized by contributing artists for their selectivity standards; [[David Lynch]]'s cow with its flesh partially ripped off, and organs showing, was rejected. The explanation is that this particular CowParade cow was rejected by the City of New York, not the CowParade organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://davidlynch.de/eatmyfear.html |title=David Lynch Cow 'Eat My Fear' |website=Davidlynch.de |date= |accessdate=July 15, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612125141/http://www.davidlynch.de/eatmyfear.html |archive-date=June 12, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Swedish organization called [[The Militant Graffiti Artists of Stockholm]] kidnapped and decapitated one of the cows of the Stockholm event in protest of the publicly provisioned cows carrying advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artliberated.org/?p%3Dcases%26id%3D27 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 29, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714191242/http://www.artliberated.org/?p=cases&amp;id=27 |archivedate=July 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Design Quality Indicator''' ('''DQI''') is a toolkit to measure, evaluate and improve the design quality of buildings.

Development of DQI was started by the [[Construction Industry Council]] (CIC) in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Page 6, Spencer, N. and Winch, G. (2002). ''How Buildings add value for clients'', London: Thomas Telford. {{ISBN|0-7277-3128-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initiated in response to the success of Key Performance Indicators devised for assessing construction process issues such as timely completion, financial control and safety on site by the construction industry's Movement for Innovation (M4I). The aim of the DQI systems was to ensure that the M4I's indicators of construction process were balanced by an assessment of the building as a product.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, S. (2004) Preface to ''Designing Better Buildings: quality and value in the built environment'', London: Spon Press. {{ISBN|0-415-31525-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex was commissioned to develop the indicator tool, which was launched as an online resource on 1 October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[[Construction Industry Council]]. ''[http://www.dqi.org.uk/DQI/Common/031001_Launch.pdf DQI Online – How well is your building designed?]'' 1 October 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004 the DQI received recognition from the [[Institute of Workplace and Facilities Management|British Institute of Facilities Management]] for the role of involving users in the design process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvadorproject.org.uk/maps/downloads/2004/IStructE%20online.pdf|format=PDF|title= DQI online service gets recognition from BIFM – ''The Structural Engineer''|date= 2 November 2004|website=elsalvadorproject.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The DQI tool was made available to users in the United States in 2006, and an online American version was launched on 20 October 2008.

Unlike its forerunner the '''Housing Quality Indicator''' (HQI) system devised for the UK's Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) by the consultancy DEGW and published on open access in February 1999,&lt;ref&gt; Wheeler, P. (2004) 'Housing quality indicators in practice' in Macmillan, S. (2004) ''Designing Better Buildings: quality and value in the built environment'', London: Spon Press. {{ISBN|0-415-31525-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the DQI system instead could be used only by approved facilitators. The criteria and the method of assessment, which though unacknowledged is a simple form of multi-attribute utility analysis, remained unaccessible to design teams and their clients unless they employed a facilitator licensed to use it. Guidance on using the HQI system can be found on the government website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/housing-quality-indicators|title=Housing quality indicators - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DQI version for hospitals is also on open access on the national archive.&lt;ref&gt;http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130124042007/http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_082085.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual framework==
DQI applies a structured approach to assess design quality based on the model by the architect [[Vitruvius]], the Roman author of the earliest surviving theoretical treatise on building in Western culture, who described design in terms of ''utilitas, firmitas ''and ''venustas'', often translated as commodity, firmness and delight.&lt;ref&gt;Gann et al. (2003), ''Design Quality Indicator as a tool for thinking: Building Research and Information'', London: Spon Press. {{DOI|10.1080/0961321032000107564}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DQI uses a modern-day interpretation of these terms as:
*Functionality (''utilitas'') – the arrangement, quality and interrelationship of spaces and how the building is designed to be useful to all.
*Build Quality (''firmitas'') – the engineering performance of the building, which includes structural stability and the integration, safety and robustness of the systems, finishes and fittings.
*Impact (''venustas'') – the building’s ability to create a sense of place and have a positive effect on the local community and environment.

==Methodology==
DQI is completed by a range of stakeholders in the briefing and design stages of a building project, or on a completed building.  Stakeholders who participate include:
*Architects
*Building users (or potential users)
*Building clients
*[[Facilities manager]]s (or future facilities managers)
*[[Project manager]]s
*[[Quantity surveyor]]s ([[Cost engineering|Cost engineer]])
*[[Structural engineer|Structural]] and [[Building services engineering|building services engineers]]

DQI is applied in a facilitated workshop that is led by a certified DQI facilitator.

==Models and related approaches==
There are three models of design quality indicator:
*DQI which is applicable to all building types&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dqi.org.uk|title=DQI - Home|website=www.dqi.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*DQI for schools which is applicable to school buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dqi.org.uk/website/dqiforschools/default.aspa|title=Schools version of DQI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model of DQI is being used on all current school projects in the UK&lt;ref&gt;[[Construction Industry Council]]. ''[http://www.cic.org.uk/newsevents/dqifs081205.pdf DQI for Schools Launched]'' 8 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and forms part of the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] 'Minimum Design Standard' for new school buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment]]. ''[http://www.cabe.org.uk/design-review/schools/minimum-design-standard Minimum Design Standards Launched]'' May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
*DQI for health buildings which was released in beta format in June 2012 on the  DQI website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dqi.org.uk/website/healthbuildings/default.aspa&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diamond Comic Distributors, Inc.''' (often called '''Diamond Comics''', '''DCD''', or casually '''Diamond''') is a [[comic book]] [[distribution (business)|distributor]] serving retailers in North America and worldwide. They transport comic books and graphic novels from both big and small comic book publishers, or suppliers, to [[retail]]ers, as well as other pop-culture products such as toys, games, and apparel. Diamond distributes to the [[direct market]] in the United States, and has an exclusive distribution arrangements with most major U.S. comic book publishers, including [[Dark Horse Comics]], [[DC Comics]], [[IDW Publishing]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicsbeat.com/2010/03/18/idw-become-premier-publisher-with-diamond/ "IDW Becomes Diamond Premiere Publisher"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322225332/http://www.comicsbeat.com/2010/03/18/idw-become-premier-publisher-with-diamond/ |date=2010-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image Comics]], [[Marvel Comics]], and more.

Diamond is also the parent company of [[Alliance Game Distributors]], Diamond Book Distributors, Diamond UK, [[Diamond Select Toys]],  [[Gemstone Publishing]], E. Gerber Products, Diamond International Galleries, Hake's Americana &amp; Collectibles, Morphy's Auctions, the [[Geppi's Entertainment Museum]], and [[Baltimore (magazine)|''Baltimore'' magazine]],

Diamond is the publisher of ''Previews'', a monthly catalog/magazine showcasing upcoming comic books, graphic novels, toys, and other pop-culture merchandise available at comic book specialty shops. The publication is available to both comic shop retailers and consumers.

==History==
In 1982, Baltimore-based comics retailer Steve Geppi founded Diamond Comic Distributors. Diamond became the successor to direct market pioneer [[Phil Seuling]]'s distribution dream when it took over [[New Media/Irjax]]'s warehouses in 1982. Diamond further bought out early-distributor [[Bud Plant Inc.]] in 1988, and main rival [[Capital City Distribution]] in 1996, to assume a near-monopoly on comics distribution, including exclusivity deals with the major [[List of comics publishing companies|comic book publishers]].

=== Beginnings ===
By 1981/82 Geppi had four comics retail locations and was already "doing a little informal distributing... for smaller retailers."&lt;ref name="Success"&gt;Warshaw, Michael with illustration by [[Neal Adams]], "From Mailman to Tycoon," ''[[Success (magazine)|Success]]'' (June, 1994), pp. 28–32&lt;/ref&gt; Geppi found himself "one of the biggest accounts" for New Media/Irjax,&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt; and when the distributor "relocated to Florida, he asked Geppi to service more accounts for a bigger discount."&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt; One of the "last loyal customers" when New Media began having fiscal difficulties, Geppi made a deal: "[t]he owner was going into retail," so Geppi agreed to provide New Media/Irjax with "free books for a period of time in return for his account list," buying parts of the company, and founding Diamond Comic Distribution.&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt;

Geppi had been a sub-distributor for Hal Shuster's Irjax in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="DuinDD"&gt;Duin, Steve and [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (ed.s) "[[Direct market|Direct Distribution]]" in ''Comics Between the Panels'' ([[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Publishing]], 1998) {{ISBN|1-56971-344-8}}, p. 126-130&lt;/ref&gt; In what [[Mile High Comics]]' [[Chuck Rozanski]] describes as an "incredibly risky and gutsy move," Geppi took over New Media/Irjax's "office and warehouse space" and, recalled Rozanski, had to "sort out the good customers from the bad overnight" negotiating with creditors to continue Shuster's distribution business as Diamond Comic Distribution.&lt;ref name="DuinDiamond"/&gt; Almost overnight, noted Rozanski, "[h]e went from being a retailer in Baltimore to having warehouses all over the place."&lt;ref name="DuinDiamond"/&gt;

Geppi named his new company 'Diamond' "after the imprint [[Marvel Comics]] used on non-returnable comics," and although the "publisher discontinued the symbol" months later, the name remained.&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt; "Diamond grew an average of 40 percent a year," as comics retail took off.&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt;

In 1983, Diamond hired an accounting firm, and in 1985 hired "no-nonsense CPA" Chuck Parker "as Diamond's first controller".&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt; In 1994, Diamond employee Mark Herr noted that this move was Geppi's "best decision", as Parker "cares nothing about the comics. To him, it's dollars and cents."&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt; Parker describes his role as "smooth[ing] the emotion out of some decisions. Steve [Geppi] is a visionary and a risk-taker... and I tend to be more conservative."&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt;

===Expansion===
After starting his business through buying New Media/Irjax's warehouses and offices in 1982, Geppi's distribution company has bought out many other distribution companies since. Many fans "with little experience" started rival distribution companies only to "find they were in over their heads," allowing Geppi to "[buy] out the smart ones or pick... up the pieces after the stupid ones went out of business," according to Herr.&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt; Diamond was aided in his efforts by the publishers themselves. In the early 1980s, Marvel and DC Comics provided trade terms favorable for larger distributors and those with efficient freight systems, effectively "play[ing] into the hands of the major distributors such as Capital and Diamond," and hastening the demise of smaller distributors.&lt;ref name="DuinDD"/&gt;

==== Bud Plant Inc. ====
Most notably, in 1988, Geppi bought up early mail-order distributor Bud Plant Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;"Bud Plant Sells Out to Diamond," ''The Comics Journal'' #124 (August 1988), pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; who had himself bought out [[Charles Abar Distribution]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="DuinPlant"&gt;Duin, Steve and [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (ed.s) "Bud Plant" in ''Comics Between the Panels'' ([[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Publishing]], 1998) {{ISBN|1-56971-344-8}}, p. 356-357&lt;/ref&gt; Plant had, since 1970, been selling [[underground comics]] (a field which Geppi and fellow distributor [[Buddy Saunders]] had tended to steer clear of).&lt;ref name="DuinPlant"/&gt; After making $19m in sales in 1987, Diamond bought West Coast distributor Plant's business&lt;ref&gt;Plant maintains a mail-order and Internet presence in art books, trade paperbacks and rare books, however. Duin, Steve and [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (ed.s) "Bud Plant" in ''Comics Between the Panels'' ([[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Publishing]], 1998) {{ISBN|1-56971-344-8}}, p. 356-357&lt;/ref&gt; in 1988 "and went national"&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt; thereby assuming control of "40 percent of the [[direct market|direct-sales market]]."&lt;ref name="DuinPlant"/&gt; (Diamond and Capital City Distribution had control of at least 70% between them.)

==== Further expansion ====
In 1990, Diamond acquired the Seattle-based sub-distributor [[Destiny Distribution]].&lt;ref name=Diamond-timeline&gt;[http://www.diamondcomics.com/Home/1/1/3/597?articleID=117735 "Diamond Timeline Chronicles 30 Years of Service &amp; Success,"] Diamond Comic Distributors, Inc. official website. Accessed Feb. 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Independent Meets Its Destiny," ''The Comics Journal'' #139 (December 1990), pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Destiny had been started by Phil Pankow in the early 1980s, and was initially supplied by Bud Plant. Also in 1990, Diamond acquired Oregon-based [[Second Genesis Distribution]]&lt;ref name=Diamond-timeline /&gt; (whose operations folded in 1991).&lt;ref&gt;"Second Genesis Delaying Its Exodus," ''The Comics Journal'' #140 (February 1991), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Diamond moved into the [[UK]] market, acquiring [[Pacific Comics|Pacific Distribution, Ltd.]]&lt;ref name=Diamond-timeline /&gt; In 1992, Diamond acquired the British distributor [[Titan Distributors]], an arm of [[Titan Entertainment Group]].&lt;ref&gt;"NewsWatch: Diamond Acquires Titan Distributors," The Comics Journal #154 (Nov. 1992), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Diamond acquired Staten Island-based distributor [[Comics Unlimited]].&lt;ref name=Diamond-timeline /&gt; By this point, Diamond had "27 warehouses in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., employ[ing] between 750 and 900 people;" operated its own trucking line; and controlled 45% of the market, making $222 million in sales.&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt;

==== Heroes World and Capital City ====
In 1995, Marvel Comics challenged Diamond and main rival Capital City by buying the third largest distributor — [[Heroes World Distribution]] — and distributing its titles in-house.&lt;ref name="DuinCC"&gt;Duin, Steve and [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (ed.s) "Capital City" in ''Comics Between the Panels'' ([[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Publishing]], 1998) {{ISBN|1-56971-344-8}}, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond reacted by outbidding Capital City for exclusive deals with Marvel's main rivals [[DC Comics]], as well as [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]], [[Image Comics|Image]], and [[Archie Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Tip 11: Go Exclusive with Diamond" ''The Comics Journal'' #185 (March 1996), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Capital City's response saw it sign exclusive deals with [[Kitchen Sink Press]] and [[Viz Comics]], but a year later faced the choice between bankruptcy and selling out. Diamond bought Capital City in the summer of 1996, assuming near-control of the comics distribution system.&lt;ref name="DuinCC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bNet"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1996_July_26/ai_18526328 "Diamond Comic Distributors acquires Capital City Distribution; Comic distribution industry stabilized by purchase," bNet: Business Wire (July 26, 1996).]&lt;/ref&gt;  The purchase price was not disclosed, but the acquisition brought an estimated $50 million in sales revenue to Diamond.&lt;ref name="bNet" /&gt;

In early 1997, when Marvel's Heroes World endeavor failed, Diamond also forged an exclusive deal with the House of Ideas&lt;ref&gt;"Hello Again: Marvel Goes with Diamond," ''The Comics Journal'' #193 (February 1997), pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; — giving the company its own section of comics catalog ''Previews'' (not least because the DC/Dark Horse/Image deal gave contractual prominence to those companies) — making "Geppi... the sole king of comics industry distribution in the summer of 1996."&lt;ref name="DuinDiamond"/&gt;

==== Antitrust litigation ====
In 1997, Diamond's position in the comics industry, as "the sole source of most new comics products to comics specialty shops," ultimately saw the company become the subject of "an investigation by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice department]] for possible [[antitrust]] violations."&lt;ref name="DuinDD"/&gt; The Justice Department launched an antitrust investigation into the comics industry and the alleged [[monopoly]] of Diamond Comics. The investigation was closed in November 2000, with no further action deemed necessary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/comicbrief/archives.cgi?category=1&amp;view=11-00#973711307 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322213439/http://www.comicbookresources.com/comicbrief/archives.cgi?category=1&amp;view=11-00 |archivedate=2006-03-22 |title=Comic Book Resources &gt; The Comic Brief &gt; DOJ concludes investigation of Diamond Comic Distributors |accessdate=2009-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Michael, "Will DC Buy Diamond?" for ''[[The Comics Journal]]'', April 5, 2002. Accessed March 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis that, although Diamond enjoyed a monopoly in the North American comic book direct market distribution, they did not enjoy a monopoly on book distribution (books including non-comic books).

==== Books and games ====
In addition to having cornered the American comics distribution market, Diamond includes a number of subsidiary and affiliated companies. UK and European comics distribution is served by Diamond UK, based in Runcorn, England.&lt;ref name="Affil"/&gt;

On August 31, 2000, Diamond Comic Distributors acquired [[Alliance Game Distributors]], North America's largest distributor of tabletop games.&lt;ref name="baltimoresun-adams"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2000-09-01/business/0009010129_1_geppi-comic-books-diamond-comic |title=Geppi, the comics king, is buying Alliance Games |date=September 1, 2000 |first=Paul |last=Adams |work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Diamond consolidated its book trade into Diamond Book Distributors, marketing [[graphic novel]]s and [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]s to bookstores including [[Barnes &amp; Noble]], [[Ingram Content Group|Ingram]], [[Baker &amp; Taylor]], [[Amazon.com]] and [[Borders Group|Borders]].&lt;ref name="Affil"/&gt;

==Criticism==
In 1983, Diamond was criticized for taking exception to certain "adult"-themed titles and scenes, effectively causing the cancellation of a series called ''[[Void Indigo]]'' for its excessive violence.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In 1987, Geppi responded to "a graphic childbirth scene in ''[[Miracleman]]'' #9 [written by [[Alan Moore]]]." Geppi wrote to retailers that:
{{cquote|"Diamond values its retailers too much to take chances on such a dangerous situation... We are not [[Censorship|censor]]s. We no more want someone deciding for us than you do. We cannot, however, stand by and watch the marketplace become a dumping ground for every sort of graphic fantasy that someone wants to live out. We have an industry to protect; we have leases to abide by; we have a community image to maintain."&lt;ref name="DuinDiamond"/&gt;}}
This call for retailers to refuse to stock ''Miracleman''&lt;ref&gt;"Geppi of Diamond Calls on Retailers to Voice Objections to Publishers," ''The Comics Journal'' #113 (December 1986), pp. 12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; led to accusations of censorship,&lt;ref&gt;"Diamond Policies Questioned," ''The Comics Journal'' #116 (July 1987), pp. 18-20.&lt;/ref&gt; charges the company was forced to address when it criticized or refused to carry other titles, including books by Kitchen Sink Press,&lt;ref name="TCJ Diamond Back Down" /&gt; and [[Dave Sim]] in 1988,&lt;ref name="TCJ Diamond Back Down"&gt;"Diamond Backs Down," ''The Comics Journal'' #121 (April 1988), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Diamond Distributors Clashes With Aardvark-Vanaheim," ''The Comics Journal'' #122 (March 1988), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A-V, Diamond Clash Again," ''The Comics Journal'' #122 (June 1988), pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Diamond Loosens Up," ''The Comics Journal'' #122 (June 1988), pp. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jon Lewis (comics)|Jon Lewis]] in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Diamond Refuses to Distribute Xeric Winner ''True Swamp''," ''The Comics Journal'' #166 (February 1994), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mike Diana]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="TCJ Bias"&gt;"What's the Story Behind Diamond's Rejection of Mike Diana?: Three Diana Comics Rejected in 1996: Publishers and Distributor give Different Reasons; Accusation of Bias against Small Publishers" ''The Comics Journal'' #192 (December 1996), pp. 7-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diamond lost customers with this approach, however, "and eventually backed down."&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt; Geppi recalls compromising, and accepting "that as a distributor, I owed the retailers the product they wanted."&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt; In fact, in an attempt to prove Diamond did not practice censorship, the company joined DC Comics in 1993 to raise money for the industry's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] advocacy group [[Comic Book Legal Defense Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;"Diamond and DC Raise Money for CBLDF," ''The Comics Journal'' #160 (June 1993), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its industry dominance, Diamond also faced charges it bullied publishers&lt;ref&gt;Stump, Greg. "News Watch: Paranoia? Some Retailers Fear Diamond," ''The Comics Journal'' #199 (October 1997), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and discriminated against small publishers. These charges first surfaced in 1988 when Diamond rejected [[Matt Feazell]]'s comic ''[[Ant Boy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Diamond Rejects Ant Boy" ''The Comics Journal'' #124 (August 1988), pp. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baisden, Greg. "Diamond Accepts ''Ant Boy''" ''The Comics Journal'' #125 (October 1988), pp. 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1989 when it similarly decided not to carry [[Allen Freeman]]'s ''Slam Bang'' anthology.&lt;ref&gt;"Diamond Distributors Rejects ''Slam Bang''" ''The Comics Journal'' #132 (November 1989), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the industry consolidation of 1996, Diamond faced similar charges in 1996,&lt;ref name="TCJ Bias" /&gt; 1999,&lt;ref&gt;Spurgeon, Tom with Craig McKenney. "Diamond and the Small Press, Part II: Breaking the Cycle: Rick Veitch Leaves Diamond Behind," ''The Comics Journal'' #21 (November 1999), pp. 16-19.&lt;/ref&gt; and 2000 (when smaller publishers like [[Fantagraphics]] and [[Drawn and Quarterly]] lodged complaints).&lt;ref&gt;Stroup, Tim and Mark Thompson. "Comic Distribution Headaches," ''Gauntlet: Exploring the Limits of Free Expression'' #19 (2000), pp. 19-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spurgeon, Tom. "Is Diamond Necessary? Small Arts Comics Publishers and their Relationship with Diamond Comic Distributors," ''The Comics Journal'' #222 (April 2000), pp. 20-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spurgeon, Tom.

"Dealing with Diamond: the Big-Little Publishers and the Big-Big Distributor," ''The Comics Journal'' #228 (November 2000), pp. 11-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publishing ==
Diamond's monthly comics retail catalog, ''Previews'' has been produced by Diamond for over twenty-five years for store owners and comic shop customers to order their products. It is additionally available for sale to customers to facilitate pre-orders from "pull and hold" or subscription customers who frequent comic shops on a regular basis. Comics publishers vie for space within the publication's pages, with Dark Horse, DC Comics, Image Comics, and [[IDW Publishing]] taking precedence as "Premier" publishers. Marvel Comics has its own mini-catalog of ''Marvel Previews'' available separately, for contractual reasons.

Geppi is also owner of [[Gemstone Publishing|Gemstone Publishing Inc.]], through which he publishes ''[[The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide]]''.&lt;ref name="GEM"/&gt; Gemstone has also published [[Russ Cochran (publisher)|Russ Cochran]]'s [[EC Comics]] reprints, [[Disney comics]] and [[Blue Book]] price guide in the past as well.

=== ''Baltimore'' ===
In 1994, Geppi purchased ''[[Baltimore (magazine)|Baltimore]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Geppi Buys ''Baltimore''," ''The Comics Journal'' #174 (February 1995), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; "a 50,000 circulation monthly and one of the nation's oldest regional publications."&lt;ref name="GEM"&gt;[http://www.geppismuseum.com/default.asp?t=1&amp;m=1&amp;c=52&amp;s=508&amp;ai=69010 Geppi's Entertainment Museum Press Room: "Geppi's Entertainment Museum President/CEO Stephen A. Geppi Bio"]. Accessed March 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gemstone Publishing===
{{main|Gemstone Publishing}}

Geppi's publishing ventures in the comics field saw him create Gemstone Publishing Inc., which was formed in large part from other purchases. In 1992, Diamond bought [[Ernst Gerber|Ernst Gerber Publishing]] (publisher-author of the ''Photo-Journal Guide to Comics'').&lt;ref name="DuinDiamond"&gt;Duin, Steve and [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (ed.s) "Diamond Comic Distributors" in ''Comics Between the Panels'' ([[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Publishing]], 1998) {{ISBN|1-56971-344-8}}, p. 125-126&lt;/ref&gt; E. Gerber Products, LLC is a Diamond-affiliated company started by Gerber in 1977 which sells [[Mylar]] bags as well as "acid-free boxes and acid-free backing boards" for comics collectors to store their collection in.&lt;ref name="Affil"&gt;[http://www.diamondcomics.com/public/default.asp?t=1&amp;m=1&amp;c=3&amp;s=305&amp;ai=36048 Diamond Comics Distributors, Inc. "Affiliated Companies"]. Accessed March 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Geppi bought Russ Cochran Publishing.&lt;ref name="DuinDiamond"/&gt; Long-term EC Comics fan Cochran auctioned [[Bill Gaines]]' personal file copies of EC publications, as well as most pages of original EC artwork (which, almost uniquely, Gaines had maintained ownership and possession of), before being granted the reprint rights to the EC back catalog itself. Geppi included Cochran's publications — and Cochran himself — under his new imprint, Gemstone Publishing.&lt;ref name="GEM"/&gt;

In 1994, Geppi bought Overstreet Publishing, taking up the publishing reins of official-Blue Book price guide ''The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide'', and other related publications, bringing them under the Gemstone imprint.&lt;ref name="DuinDiamond"/&gt; Geppi's publishing activities with Gemstone Publishing consist primarily of reprints of classic titles and artworks, as well as publications (including professional [[comics fanzine|fanzines]] "pro-zines") focusing heavily on the history of the comics medium. Many Gemstone publications revolve around ''[[Comic Book Marketplace]]''-editor and EC-shepherd Russ Cochran.

====EC Comics reprints====
{{main|EC Comics|EC Archives}}

Cochran, like Geppi, was a particular fan of [[Carl Barks]]' Disney comics, and had previously-published EC reprints in association with Disney-reprinter Gladstone Publishing. In the early 1990s, Geppi's Gemstone embarked on a full series of reprints of classic EC titles, starting with new reprints of the Cochran/Gladstone-reprints of ''[[The Haunt of Fear]]'', ''[[The Vault of Horror]]'' and ''[[Weird Science (comic)|Weird Science]]'' (all 1992). Gemstone also republished (in single issue and 'annual' — four issues per 'annual' — format) EC's ''[[List of EC Comics Publications#New Trend|New Trend]]'' and ''[[List of EC Comics Publications#New Direction|New Direction]]'' titles between 1992 and 2000.

In 2005, Gemstone added to Cochran's earlier-published oversize, hardback, black &amp; white slip-cased "The Complete EC Library" collections with the complete ''[[List of EC Comics Publications#Picto-Fiction|Picto-Fiction]]'' collection, comprising the EC comics: ''[[Confessions Illustrated]]'', ''[[Crime Illustrated]]'', ''[[Shock Illustrated]]'' and ''[[Terror Illustrated]]'', along with "18 previously unseen stories, never published before".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookpalace.com/acatalog/Home_Complete_EC_Library_31.html The Book Palace's "Complete EC Library" pages]. Accessed 12 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Gemstone began producing a more durable and luxurious series of hardback reprint collections; the [[EC Archives]] — similar to the [[DC Archive Editions|DC Archives]] and [[Marvel Masterworks]] volumes — which reprint in full-color hardback ('archival') format sequential compilations of the EC titles. Designed by art director/designer [[Michael Kronenberg]], a number of volumes have been released, with the entirety of the ''[[List of Entertaining Comics publications#New Trend|New Trend]]'' and ''[[List of Entertaining Comics publications#New Direction|New Direction]]'' planned for eventual release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marvelmasterworksfansite.yuku.com/sreply/154876/t/WEIRD-SCIENCE-3-Error.html Michael Kronenberg posting at MarvelMasterworksFansite.Yuku.com, July 26, 2008]. Accessed September 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; These EC Archives volumes have drawn praise for their quality, and feature introductions by such notable EC fans as [[George Lucas]], [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Joe Dante]] and [[Paul Levitz]].

====Disney comics====
{{main|Disney comics|Carl Barks}}

In December 2002, it was announced that "Gemstone Publishing had signed the license to publishing Disney comics in North America," with ex-Gladstone Publishing editor-in-chief John Clark joining Gemstone in the same position over its Disney line.&lt;ref name="ScoopDisney"&gt;[http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/public/default.asp?t=1&amp;m=1&amp;c=34&amp;s=265&amp;ai=42560&amp;ssd=1/25/2003&amp;arch=y "Starting Over — The Return of the Disney Comics" online in Diamond's ''Scoop'', January 25, 2003]. Accessed March 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Launched with a title for [[Free Comic Book Day]] 2003, the line started soon after with ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' and ''[[Uncle Scrooge|Walt Disney's Uncle Scrooge]]'', both described by Clark as "monthly 64-page prestige-format books at $6.95, which is the same price they were when last produced, in 1998."&lt;ref name="ScoopDisney"/&gt; Other titles followed, and Gemstone held their license until early 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wolfstad.com/dcw/blog/2009/03/gemstone-ends-disney-license/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide====
{{main|The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide}}

The (Official) Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide, first published by Robert M. Overstreet in 1970 as one of the earliest authorities on [[United States|American]] [[comic book]] industry grading and collection values. Overstreet sold his company to Gemstone in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Overstreet Purchase Causes Stir," ''The Comics Journal'' #172 (November 1994), pp. 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt; but continued to "serve as author and/or publisher of Geppi's Entertainment Publishing &amp; Auctions' line of books."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geppisentertainment.com/bob_overstreet.html "Robert M. Overstreet" bio at ''Geppi's Entertainment'']. Accessed April 7, 2009  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718002412/http://www.geppisentertainment.com/bob_overstreet.html |date=July 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Publication of the ''Price Guide'' was taken over by Gemstone in 1998, Gemstone took over publication, and the twenty-eighth edition to the present have been (co-)published by Geppi's Gemstone publications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicsresearch.org/collect.html Comics Research.org's "Collecting Guides"]. Accessed March 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Guide'''s 39th edition was published by Gemstone Publishing in 2009.

Overstreet also produced a variety of smaller publications updating his yearly guides on a monthly schedule. The most recent of these - ''Overstreet's Comic Price Review'' - began publication from Gemstone in July 2003, and was a monthly publication designed to update the yearly price guide more regularly, as well as provide articles, analysis and various lists of comics prices.

Gemstone published more than a hundred issues of the magazine ''Comic Book Marketplace'', a monthly magazine for comics fans focusing heavily on the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden]] and [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver]] ages, while more popular magazines (such as ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'') skew more recent in focus.

====Future====
In early 2009, the future of Gemstone Publishing was unclear, after reports of unpaid printing bills, particularly from the EC Archives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pwbeat.publishersweekly.com/blog/2009/02/18/steve-geppis-debt-woes-growing/ Heidi MacDonald, "Steve Geppi’s debt woes growing" in ''The Beat'', February 18, 2009].

In 2008, Diamond introduced ComicSuite, an add-on application for Microsoft Dynamics’ Retail Management System (RMS) software. Together, ComicSuite &amp; RMS give specialty storeowners a point-of-sale (POS) system specifically geared towards their unique business model, offering a host of exclusive features that grant you direct communication with Diamond databases, making it easier than ever before to place orders, track inventory and maintain “pull-and-hold” subscriptions for your customers."

== Affiliated and subsidiary companies ==
In 1995, Geppi founded Diamond International Galleries, which acquired Hake's [[Americana]] &amp; [[Collectibles]] [[auction house]] (2004), and in 2005, Pennsylvania-based Morphy Auctions.&lt;ref name="Antiq"&gt;[http://www.journalofantiques.com/Sept06%5Cfeature.html "Sneak Preview Geppi's Entertainment Museum at Camden Yards – Baltimore, Maryland," ''The Journal of Antiques and Collectibles'' (September 2006)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705084736/http://www.journalofantiques.com/Sept06/feature.html |date=2008-07-05 }}.

While they also make action figures in a variety of sizes, as well as banks, busts, statues and prop replicas, many of their licensed properties are released in the form of [[Minimates]], which has helped make Minimates one of the most prolific and diverse block figure toy lines in the world. In 2007, after years of partnership, Diamond Select Toys made a move to acquire select assets of New York-based design house Art Asylum,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toymania.com/news/messages/9319.shtml "Diamond Select Acquires Art Asylum"]&lt;/ref&gt; the creators of Minimates and DST has since developed Minimates based on its own concepts, under the brands Minimates M.A.X. and Calico Jack's Pirate Raiders.

=== Diamond International Galleries ===
In 1995, Geppi "opened Diamond International Galleries," a showplace for comics and collectibles, part of Geppi's attempts to "see... collectibles attain serious respect."&lt;ref name="Antiq"/&gt; Nine years later, Diamond International Galleries purchased "one of the country’s first, and most respected, collectibles auction houses: Hake's Americana &amp; Collectibles."&lt;ref name="Antiq"/&gt; In 2005, Geppi added the "[[Denver, Pennsylvania|Denver]], Pennsylvania-based Morphy Auctions" to his growing stable of parts of the collectibles market, which already included publishing the main comics price guide: ''The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide''.&lt;ref name="Antiq"/&gt;

Geppi describes his International Galleries as being "at the heart of many significant opportunities to preserve, promote and present historical comic character collectibles," an endeavor that led to his establishing Geppi's Entertainment Museum.&lt;ref name="Affil"/&gt; Geppi's galleries showcase much of his private collection, including comics, [[film poster|movie poster]]s, toys, original artwork by individuals including "Carl Barks, [[Gustaf Tenggren|Gustav Tengren &lt;small&gt;(sic)&lt;/small&gt;]], [[Alex Ross]], [[Murphy Anderson]], [[Joe Shuster]], [[Joe Simon]] and [[Charles Schulz]]."&lt;ref name="Affil"/&gt;

'''Dichromacy''' (''di''  meaning "two" and ''chroma'' meaning "color") is the state of having two types of functioning [[color]] receptors, called [[cone cell]]s, in the [[eye]]s. Organisms with dichromacy are called dichromats. Dichromats can match any color they see with a mixture of no more than two pure [[spectrum|spectral lights]]. By comparison, [[trichromat]]s require three pure spectral lights to match all colors that they can perceive, and [[Tetrachromacy|tetrachromats]] require four.

Dichromacy in humans is a color vision defect in which one of the three basic color mechanisms is absent or not functioning. It is hereditary and sex-linked, predominantly affecting males.&lt;ref name="Cassin"&gt;Cassin, B. and Solomon, S. ''Dictionary of Eye Terminology''. Gainesville, Florida: Triad Publishing Company, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Dichromacy occurs when one of the cone pigments is missing and color is reduced to two dimensions.&lt;ref name="Tiresias"&gt;[http://www.tiresias.org/guidelines/colour_blindness.htm "Guidelines: Colour Blindness."] Tiresias.org. Retrieved 29 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
There are various kinds of [[color blindness]]:

* [[Protanopia]] is a severe form of red-green color blindness, in which there is impairment in perception of very long wavelengths, such as reds.  To these individuals, reds are perceived as beige or grey and greens tend to look beige or grey like reds. It is also the most common type of dichromacy today. This problem occurs because patients do not have the red cone cells in the retina.&lt;ref name="HanggiIngersoll2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanggi|first1=Evelyn B.|last2=Ingersoll|first2=Jerry F.|last3=Waggoner|first3=Terrace L.|title=Color vision in horses (Equus caballus): Deficiencies identified using a pseudoisochromatic plate test.|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|volume=121|issue=1|year=2007|pages=65–72|issn=1939-2087|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.121.1.65}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Protanomaly]] is a less severe version.
* [[Deuteranopia]] consists of an impairment in perceiving medium wavelengths, such as greens.  [[Deuteranomaly]] is a less severe form of deuteranopia.  Those with deuteranomaly cannot see reds and greens like those without this condition; however, they can still distinguish them in most cases. It is very similar to protanopia. In this form, patients do not have green cone cells in the retina, which makes it hard to see the green color.&lt;ref name="HanggiIngersoll2007" /&gt;
* A rarer form of color blindness is [[tritanopia]], where there exists an inability to perceive short wavelengths, such as blues.  Sufferers have trouble distinguishing between yellow and blue. They tend to confuse greens and blues, and yellow can appear pink. This is the rarest of all dichromacy, and occurs in around 1 in 100,000 people. Patients do not have the blue cone cells in the retina.

==Testing for dichromacy==
The three determining elements of a dichromatic opponent-colour space are the missing colour, the null-luminance plane, and the null-chrominance plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scheibner | first1 = H. | last2 = Cleveland | first2 = S. | year = 1998 | title = Dichromacy characterized by chrominance planes | url = | journal = Vision Research | volume = 38 | issue = 21| pages = 3403–3407 | doi=10.1016/s0042-6989(97)00373-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The description of the phenomena itself does not indicate the colour that is impaired to the dichromat, however, it does provides enough information to identify the fundamental colour space, the colours that are seen by the dichromat. This is based on testing both the null-chrominance plane and null-luminance plane which intersect on the missing colour. The cones excited to a corresponding colour in the colour space are visible to the dichromat and those that are not excited are the missing colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scheibner | first1 = H. | last2 = Cleveland | first2 = S. | year = 1997 | title = Dichromacy characterized by chrominance planes | url = | journal = Vision Research | volume = 38 | issue = 1| pages = 3403–3407 | doi=10.1016/s0042-6989(97)00373-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals that are dichromats==
It is more informative to use situations where less than the total visual system is operating when studying about vision. For example, a system by which cones are the sole visual receptors could be used. This is rare in humans but certain animals possess this trait and this proves useful in understanding the concept of dichromacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobs | first1 = G.

The exceptions to dichromatic vision in placental mammals are [[Catarrhini|primates closely related to humans]], which are usually trichromats, and sea mammals (both [[pinniped]]s and [[cetacea]]ns) which are cone [[monochromacy|monochromat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vorobyev|first=M|title=Ecology and evolution of primate colour vision|journal=Clinical &amp; Experimental Optometry|date=Jul 2004|volume=87|issue=4–5|pages=230–8|pmid=15312027|url=http://www.csh.rit.edu/~oguns/school/psychology/Articles/EcologyEvolutionPrimateColorVision.pdf|accessdate=7 January 2013|doi=10.1111/j.1444-0938.2004.tb05053.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New World Monkeys]] are a partial exception: in most species, males are dichromats, and about 60% of females are trichromats, but the [[owl monkey]]s are cone [[monochromacy|monochromats]], and both sexes of [[howler monkey]]s are trichromats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobs | first1 = G.

==Color detecting abilities of dichromats==

According to colour vision researchers at the [[Medical College of Wisconsin]] (including [[Jay Neitz]]), each of the three standard colour-detecting cones in the retina of [[trichromat]]s – [[blue]], [[green]] and [[red]] – can pick up about 100 different gradations of colour. If each detector is independent of the others, simple [[exponentiation]] gives a total number of colours discernible by an average human as their product, or about 1 million;&lt;ref name="Roth 2006" &gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06256/721190-114.stm
  |title=Some women who are tetrachromats may see 100,000,000 colors, thanks to their genes
  |author=Mark Roth
  |publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
  |date= 13 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless, other researchers have put the number at upwards of 2.3 million.&lt;ref name=Jacobs09/&gt; Exponentiation suggests that a dichromat (such as a human with red-green [[color blindness]]) would be able to distinguish about 10,000 different colours,&lt;ref&gt;"Color Vision:Almost Reason for Having Eyes" by Jay Neitz, Joseph Carroll, and Maureen Neitz  Optics &amp; Photonics News January 2001 1047-6938/01/01/0026/8- Optical Society of America&lt;/ref&gt; but no such calculation has been verified by [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] testing.

Furthermore, dichromats have a significantly higher threshold than trichromats for coloured stimuli flickering at low (1&amp;nbsp;Hz) frequencies. At higher (10 or 16&amp;nbsp;Hz) frequencies, dichromats perform as well as or better than trichromats.&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe Lindsay T. ; de Luca Emanuela ; Hansen Thorsten; Gegenfurtner Karl R. "Advantages and disadvantages of human dichromacy" ''JOURNAL OF VISION'',  Volume: 6   Issue: 3   Pages: 213–223   {{doi|10.1167/6.3.3}}  Published: 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bayer Florian S.; Vivian Paulun C.; Weiss David; Gegenfurtner Karl R. "A tetrachromatic display for the spatiotemporal control of rod and cone stimulation" ''JOURNAL OF VISION'',  Volume: 15   Issue: 11   {{doi|10.1167/15.11.15}}  Published: 2015&lt;/ref&gt; This means such animals would still observe the flicker instead of a temporally fused visual percept as is the case in human movie watching at a high enough [[frame rate]].

The recently passed Louisiana law was a way for the state to [[Video game controversy|censor video games]] by making it illegal to supply minors with video games considered violent, similar to laws making pornographic material unavailable to minors, but using violence as the criteria instead of sexual content. The lawsuit claims that the law infringed on the video game industry's constitutional right to freedom of expression.

The suit was successful in getting the law overturned in late 2006, and the plaintiffs were awarded attorney's fees in early 2007.

==Lawsuit ==
The [[plaintiff]]s in the case, the [[Entertainment Software Association]] (ESA) and the [[Entertainment Merchants Association]] (EMA), claimed that Louisiana criminal law RS 14:91.14 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=78708|title=Louisiana Statute: La RS 14:91.14 Prohibited sales of video or computer games to minors}}&lt;/ref&gt; is unconstitutional on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] grounds. The defendants were [[Attorney General]] of Louisiana, [[Charles Foti|Charles C. Foti, Jr.]], and Doug Moreau, US [[District Attorney]] of the [[Parish]] of East [[Baton Rouge]]. Louisiana Governor [[Kathleen Blanco]] had signed [[Louisiana House Bill 1381|HB1381]] just the day before as Act 441 of the 2006 Louisiana Regular Session. The law made it illegal for someone in Louisiana to sell, lease or rent a violent video game (as defined in the Act) to someone under 18 years of age.

The suit pointed out that in other states, similar laws had already been declared unconstitutional, and thus impossible to enforce. Furthermore, according to the suit, the law would have chilling results with video games being less likely to be accessible by adults (as well as by minors, as was the initial intent of the law).

==Aftermath==
Louisiana Middle District Judge James J. Brady issued a [[preliminary injunction]] on August 24, 2006.&lt;ref name="GP injunction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamepolitics.livejournal.com/347139.html |title=Judge Issues Preliminary Injunction Against Louisiana Law |accessdate=2007-01-20 |last=McCauley |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis McCauley |coauthors= |date=2006-08-25 |year= |month= |work= |publisher=[[GamePolitics.com]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212163016/http://gamepolitics.livejournal.com/347139.html |archivedate=2007-02-12 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[image:Environment-Triptych-2008-terracotta-portraits-sculptor-Jon-Edgar.jpg|thumb|right|''Environment Triptych'']]
The '''''Environment Triptych''''', by sculptor [[Jon Edgar]], is a group of three portrait heads of environmental thinkers of the day. First assembled in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;http://jonedgar.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/2008-environment-triptych-mabey-midgley-lovelock.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; it is composed of the terracotta heads of [[James Lovelock]], proposer of the [[Gaia hypothesis]], moral philosopher [[Mary Midgley]], and writer [[Richard Mabey]]. Edgar worked with three in either [[Cornwall]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] or [[Norfolk]] during visits in 2006 and 2007.

The heads have a relevance as individual portraits, but the interplay of the three heads plinthed together seemed to add something; perhaps emphasising the sitters’ diverse efforts in influencing human behaviour and our interaction with the planet and its other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;http://jonedgar.wordpress.com/2011/05/17/the-environment-series-heads/&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Triptych'' has led to the ''[[Environment Series]]'' of heads of environmentally aware sitters,&lt;ref&gt;article on the Human Clay exhibition, Surrey Advertiser. 2 Dec 2011 p.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.surrey.ac.uk/arts/visualarts/exhibitions%20and%20events/the_human_clay_jon_edgar.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.surrey.ac.uk/arts/visualarts/exhibitions%20and%20events/The%20Human%20Clay%20Exhibition.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Chris Rapley]], [[Gordon Murray]], [[Tim Smit]], and [[Guy Watson]].

==History==
Construction of the Fahai Temple started in 1439 during the [[Ming dynasty]] and was completed in 1443.

'''''Infermental''''' was a [[magazine]] published solely on [[videocassette]]s. The concept was conceived the Hungarian filmmaker [[Gábor Bódy]] in 1980. The name is a combination of the words "international", "ferment", and "experimental".

==History==
The eleven volumes of ''Infermental'' were published from 1980 to 1991 with a rotating series of editors from different countries. Each annual issue assembled from four to seven hours of the audio-visual work that represented the latest national trends of each country.

''Infermental'''s ten issues (and one special) totaled approximately seventy hours of material from more than a thousand artists and thirty six countries. Among the numerous participating artists were [[Gary Hill]], Rafael Montañez Ortiz, [[Jon Jost]], [[Peter Weibel]], [[Heiko Daxl]], Marina Grzinic, Aina Smid, [[Joan Jonas]], [[Yello]], Ulrike Rosenbach, Hiroshi Ito, [[Mona Hatoum]], [[Paul Garrin]], and [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]].

In 1990, Veruschka Bódy, who co-ordinated the project after Gábor Bódy's death in 1985, stated, "The annual anthologies, published by local editors (artist groups from 12 cities), are in fact a rich find for semoticians, topologists and visual philosophers. With this now 65 hours long video archive, a vocabulary of the 1980s has been made available to the public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/stories/storyReader$5260|title=ZKM: 2006 Infermental|accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availablility==
The ''Infermental'' collection is accessible to the public at the [[Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe]].

The '''Korean Film Archive''' or called '''Korean Federation of Film Archives''' and '''KOFA''' is the sole film archive in [[South Korea]] with nationwide coverage. It was founded in [[Seoul]] in 1974 as a non-profit organization. In 1976 KOFA joined the [[International Federation of Film Archives]] (FIAF) as an observer, and gained its full membership of FIAF in 1985.&lt;ref name="Doosan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?&amp;masterno=703468&amp;contentno=703468 |title=한국영상자료원 Korean Federation of Film Archives 韓國映像資料院|publisher=[[Doosan Encyclopedia]] |language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreafilm.org/kofa/history.asp |title=Korean Film Archive |publisher=Koreafilm.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KOFA's main duties are to collect, preserve and categorize films and film-related materials, as well as to foster accessibility to its collections.

{{Main article|Film censorship}}
This is a '''list of banned films'''.

For nearly the entire [[history of film]] production, certain films have been [[Ban (law)|banned]] by film censorship or review organizations for political or [[morality|moral]] reasons or for controversial content, such as racism. Censorship standards vary widely by country, and can vary within an individual country over time due to political or moral change.

Many countries have government-appointed or private commissions to censor and rate productions for film and television exhibition. While it is common for films to be edited to fall into certain rating classifications, this list includes only films that have been explicitly prohibited from public screening.

A few years later, however, copies of the film began to turn up to the embarrassment of the West German government. After a lengthy investigation, it was determined that another negative existed in [[East Germany]] and it was used it to make prints that were dubbed in Arabic and distributed in Middle Eastern countries such as Egypt and Lebanon. Though that negative has never been located, it has been widely suspected that this version was produced and distributed by the [[Stasi]] or the [[KGB]] in order to arouse anti-semitism among Egyptian and Palestinians against the US backed Israel (and henceforth, support for the Soviet backed Egyptian president [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]).&lt;ref name="Hull1973"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hull|first=David Stewart |title=Film in the Third Reich; art and propaganda in Nazi Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aj8qAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=2011-12-19|year=1973|publisher=Simon and Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Magill|first=Frank Northen |title=Magill's survey of cinema, foreign language films|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3GZZAAAAMAAJ|year=1985|publisher=Salem Press|isbn=978-0-89356-247-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkeley1960"&gt;{{cite book|author=University of California, Berkeley|title=Film quarterly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uz8UAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=2011-12-19|year=1960|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The copyright of the film is held by the government-owned [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Foundation|F.W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7716">[[File:Spoleto SSalvaore Navata.jpg|thumb|250px|Basilica of San Salvatore ([[Spoleto]])]]
The term '''Lombard architecture''' refers to the architecture of the Kingdom of the [[Lombards]] in  [[Italy]], which lasted from 568 to 774 (with residual permanence in southern Italy  until the 10th-11th centuries) and which was commissioned by Lombard kings and dukes.

The architectural works of the Lombards in northern Italy ([[Langobardia Major]]) have been mostly lost due to later renovations or reconstructions, the few exceptions including the   Lombard Temple at [[Cividale del Friuli]] or the church of Santa Maria fuori Portas at [[Castelseprio]].  More examples have instead survived in southern Italy ([[Langobardia Minor]]), especially in what was the [[Duchy of Benevento]]: they include the city's walls, the church of [[Santa Sofia, Benevento|Santa Sofia]] and the [[Rocca dei Rettori]], one of the few surviving Lombard military structures, as well as other minor sites near Benevento and in the former [[duchy of Spoleto]].

The main surviving examples of Lombard architecture have been included in the [[Longobards in Italy, Places of Power (568-774 A.D.)]] site. This consists of seven places with notable architectural, artistic and sculptural, and it is in the [[UNESCO Heritage list]] since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1318 Longobards in Italy - UNESCO World Heritage Centre&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:San salvatore (brescia) interno2.JPG|thumb|250px|Basilica of San Salvatore in [[Brescia]]]]
The most ancient edifices built by the Lombards in Italy, and in particular in their capital, [[Pavia]], have been destroyed or largely renewed in later times. Some trends, which usually ran in different ways from the [[Roman architecture|Roman]] and Palaeo-Christian architectures predominant in Italy up to late Antiquity, have been identified from archaeological studies or other sources. The destroyed church of Santa Maria in Pertica at Pavia, for example, had a typical Roman plan (octagonal with an [[ambulatory]] delimited by columns) but very high central body was a novelty. The [[Baptistery of San Giovanni ad Fontes]], in [[Lomello]], also departed from the typical Palaeo-Christian compactness in the use of a tall central octagon.&lt;ref name=DeVecchi&gt;{{cite book|first=Pierluigi |last=De Vecchi|author2=Elda Cerchiari |title= I Longobardi in Italia|pages=309–314}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it had been in Roman times, the commission of lay and religious buildings was used by the Lombard elite to express their prestige and to legitimate their authority.&lt;ref name=Rovagn&gt;{{cite book|first= Sergio |last=Rovagnati|title= I Longobardi|pages=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 7th and 8th centuries the Lombard architecture evolved in an original direction, with increasing references to Classical art. This trend, characterized by the co-presence of different influences and the adoption of new techniques, culminated in the reign of king [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]] (712-744), in particular at [[Cividale del Friuli]]. Edifices such as the Lombard Tempietto in the latter city, or the [[Monastery of San Salvatore, Brescia|Monastery of San Salvatore]] at [[Brescia]] show echoes of the contemporary architecture in [[Ravenna]].&lt;ref name=Adorno&gt;{{cite book|first=Piero |last=Adorno|chapter=L'Alto Medioevo|title= L'arte italiana'', Vol. 1, part II |location=Florence|publisher=D'Anna|year= 1992|page=564}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this period,  the construction of monasteries received a particular impulse, not only as places of adoration or as shows of faith of the commissioners, but also as shelters for the latter's assets and persons and as sites of political control. King [[Desiderius]] (756-774), and with him numerous dukes, gave a particular boost to this trend, which had no direct comparison in the rest of Europe at the time.&lt;ref name=Rovagn/&gt;

The development of Lombard architecture in northern Italy was halted by the conquest of [[Charlemagne]] in 774. In southern Italy, still partly under effective Lombard domination, architecture followed original lines until the conquest by the [[Italo-Normans|Normans]] in the 11th century. This unity is shown in particular by the most important Lombard edifice in what was Langobardia Minor, the church of [[Santa Sofia (Benevento)|Santa Sofia]] at [[Benevento]]: built in the 8th century, it follows the same pattern of Santa Maria in Pertica with an elevated central body, although mitigated by [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] elements such as the articulations of the volumes and the basic structure itself, perhaps inspired by [[Hagia Sofia]] at [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=Adorno/&gt;

When they arrived in Italy in the late 6th century, the Lombards had no architectural tradition of their own. They thus relied on local workforce, taking advantage of the presence of organizations and guilds capable of high level works, which had been kept alive thanks to the relative survival of the urban civilization in Italy after the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] (differently from most of contemporary Christian western Europe).&lt;ref name=Rovagn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Adorno/&gt;

'''Makonde chess sets''' are made by the [[Makonde people|Makonde tribe]] of south-west [[Tanzania]] and [[Mozambique]] who have for centuries been greatly skilled in wood carving and [[Makonde art]] is a distinctive style.  [[Chess set]]s were originally made for export to Europe but the pattern of the pieces follows traditional Makonde designs rather than any established chess pattern.

==History==

The European market for [[Makonde art]] developed from the 1930s through [[Portuguese Mozambique|Portuguese colonization]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Bortolot, "Artesaos da Nossa Patria: Makonde blackwood sculptors, cooperatives, and the art of socialist revolution in postcolonial mozambique", p. 253, in Sidney Littlefield Kasfir (ed), Till Förster (ed), ''African Art and Agency in the Workshop'', pp. 252-273, Indiana University Press, 2013 {{ISBN|0253007410}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chess sets were first exported by Norman Kirk, a New Zealander who owned a lime and cashew nut plantation in Tanzania (then [[Tanganyika Territory|Tanganyika]]).  Kirk had been impressed by the work of the Makonde artist Likenikeni Sabini after visiting his workshop at [[Ndanda]] mission in the 1950s.  After this visit he began buying and exporting Makonde art to Europe.  Kirk enticed Sabini to come and work for him at his plantation where Sabini trained other carvers for Kirk.  At some point Kirk initiated production of chess sets and the product became popular in the 1960s.  The pieces in the chess set were based on the ''chidiu'', a traditional [[bottle stopper]].  This took the form of a human head with Makonde facial [[scarification]].&lt;ref&gt;Kingdon, pp. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt;

After Kirk's death in 1969 a group of carvers who had formerly supplied Kirk continued to carve chess sets.  This group was centred on the village of [[Ziwani]] near [[Mtwara]].  Several new themes were developed by this group including the ''seated smoker'' set, the ''drummer'' set, and the ''bird'' set.  Scarification marks tend to be omitted on modern pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Kingdon, pp. 74-75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:ChessPiecesMakonde.jpg|thumb|Makonde chess set]]
The king (''bulisa''&lt;ref name=piecename/&gt;), as the tallest piece, has a very tall African tribal hat worn by tribal chiefs.  Alternatively, the hat may be a [[fez]] of the type formerly worn by colonial police and soldiers.  The king always has this hat even in sets which do not take human form. The queen, as representative of women (''nkongwe''&lt;ref name=piecename/&gt;), carries a water pot on her head which is the custom in rural Africa. The knight is in the style of a giraffe (''twiga''&lt;ref name=piecename/&gt;); horses were unknown to the tribe as they cannot survive in this part of Africa because of the [[tsetse fly]]. Among the best of Makonde skills are carvings of animals.  As there were no castles in Makonde territory, they designed the rook in the shape of a grain store representative of the importance of a good grain harvest, or sometimes as a tribal hut (''ng'ande''&lt;ref name=piecename&gt;Kingdon, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;).  Both of these represented security. The bishop (''chikopa''&lt;ref name=piecename/&gt;) has a traditional bishop’s [[mitre]] headgear (possibly due to European influence) but without the facial scarification of the other characters. In some carvings the bishop appears as a [[witch doctor]] (native to 19th century east African culture). The pawn is carved in the style of a hard working Makonde tribesman, like the sculptor himself.

Makonde chess sets are usually carved from [[african blackwood]], known as ''mpingo'' (the black pieces) and a kind of [[rosewood]] (the white pieces).  Chess sets of this style are still carved in Tanzania and Mozambique.

==Life==
He was born in [[Dinawar]] about 1356. Mala Pareshan was a [[Sufi]] and a member of [[Hurufism]].

==Poetry==
His [[Diwan (poetry)|Diwan]] was first printed in [[Kermanshah]] in 1916 and then it was printed several times later in different places. His poems have a [[Syllabic verse|syllabic]] meter, a common characteristic of [[Gorani language (Zaza-Gorani)|Gorani]] or [[Hawrami dialects|Hawrami]] poetry.

During the 1960s and into the 1980s, [[Daisaku Ikeda]] (at the time the president of the [[Soka Gakkai]]) established a number of cultural programs and institutions including the Institute of Oriental Philosophy, the Min-on Concert Association, and the [[Tokyo Fuji Art Museum]]. The Min-On Concert Association was established in 1963. It arose from Ikeda's perception that access to high-quality live music performances was beyond the reach of the majority of Japanese people. "Min-On" is an abbreviation of "Minshu Ongaku" or "Music for the People". The association began with a series of subscription concerts and became a foundation in 1965. Ikeda's other goal for Min-On was to promote cross-cultural understanding through music, and to that end the association also began a series of exchanges which introduced performing artists from other countries to Japanese audiences and sent Japanese artists abroad.{{r|Seager}}{{r|Norton}}{{r|Galliano}}

In its early years, the organization was sometimes dismissed as sectarian. However, according to its past president Hiroyasu Kobayashi, that perception began to change in  1981 when Min-On underwrote a tour by Milan's [[La Scala]] opera company, one of the first Western opera companies to perform in Japan. In 1997, the Min-On Cultural Center was opened in downtown Tokyo and now houses the organization's offices as well as its music museum and library. By the end of the 1990s Min-On had organized 70,000 concerts with performers from 100 different countries and attended by over 100 million people in Japan.{{r|Laurence2017}}{{r|Galliano}}

==Activities==
Min-On's three main activities are its concerts, the Tokyo International Music Competition, and its music museum and library. However, it also runs the  Min-On Music Research Institute, organizes lectures and conferences on music, and publishes books and monographs.{{r|Laurence2017}}{{r|MLAJ}}

===Concerts===
Min-On's concert performances are held not only in the concert halls of major Japanese cities but also in small towns in the Japanese hinterland. The concerts present a wide range of styles and genres including European and [[Chinese opera]], ballet, and indigenous folk music. In the late 1960s Min-On began its World Ballet Series which brought tours by the [[American Ballet Theatre]] and [[The Royal Ballet]] to Japan. In 1968 its also brought the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]] to Japan for a three-week concert tour. The [[La Scala]] tour of 1981 was described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "the cultural event of the year in Japan."{{r|NYT1}} The company gave 24 performances in Tokyo, Osaka and Yokohama with all performances televised by [[NHK]]. There were also two chamber music concerts by the La Scala Octet. Other classical performers who have appeared in Japan under the auspices of Min-On include the singers [[Plácido Domingo]], [[Roberto Alagna]], and [[Charlotte Henriette de Rothschild|Charlotte de Rothschild]] and the Brazilian pianist [[José Carlos Amaral Vieira|Amaral Vieira]] who has made multiple tours for Min-On since the early 1990s.{{r|OCLC1}}{{r|Billboard1}}{{r|Rothschild}}{{r|Seager}}

The Min-On Festival of Contemporary Music ran from 1969 to 1990 in conjunction with the Tokyo International Music Competition. The concerts were given at the [[Tokyo Bunka Kaikan]] concert hall and presented contemporary works by Japanese composers, several of them commissioned by the association. Recordings of the festival concerts given between 1979 and 1988 were released on the Japanese label Camerata.{{r|LOC}} Min-On's annual Tango Concert Series, a long-running cultural exchange program between Japan and Argentina, began in 1970 began with a tour by the orchestra of {{ill|José Basso|es}} and the singers [[Alfredo Belusi]] and Carlos Rossi. In 2011 Jamaica became the 104th country to tour Japan under the auspices Min-On. The tour was the second in Min-On's ''Caribbean Musical Cruise'' series. The series began in 2009 with a tour of artists from [[Trinidad and Tobago]].{{r|Masami}}{{r|Gleaner}}

===Tokyo International Music Competition===
Min-On established the Tokyo International Music Competition in 1966 as a competition for singers. A category for chamber ensembles was introduced in 1974. However, the longest running of the categories has been the conducting competition which began in 1967 and is held every three years. Two of the past first prize winners, Yukinori Tezuka (1967) and [[Kazuhiro Koizumi]] (1970) became conductors of the [[New Japan Philharmonic]]. Olivier Grangean, who won the 1991 competition, later became [[music director]] of the [[National Symphony Orchestra of Colombia]]. No first prizes were awarded for the 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2012 competitions. In 2015, the first prize was awarded to the Spanish conductor {{ill|Diego Martin-Etxebarria|es}}.{{r|Competitions}}{{r|NJP}}{{r|Bogota}}{{r|ABC}}

===Music museum and library===
Min-On's  music museum has collections of pianos, [[music box]]es, and ethnic musical instruments from a variety of cultures. The piano collection includes an [[Anton Walter]] piano from the early 1780s as well the piano used for 30 years by the jazz musician [[Herbie Hancock]] who donated it to the museum.{{r|Hancock}}

As of 2006, the library held 30,000 books, 45,000 volumes of sheet music, 200 magazine titles, and a large collection of [[piano roll]]s. It also holds thousands of photographs and audio and video recordings.{{r|MLAJ}}

The '''Open Content License''' is a [[share-alike]] [[public copyright license]] by [[Open Content Project]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="wiley"/&gt; The license can be applied to a work to make it [[open content]]. It is one of the earliest non-software free content licenses.

== History and reception ==
The Open Content License, dated July 14, 1998, predates the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] (GFDL) and other non-software public licenses. Though discussions were held between [[David A. Wiley]], creator of the Open Content License, and [[Richard Stallman]], leader of the [[Free Software Foundation]], who created the [[GNU General Public License]] for software and would create the GFDL.&lt;ref name="grossman"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Grossman| first = Lev| title = New Free License to Cover Content Online| work = Netly News| accessdate = 2010-12-27| date = 1998-07-18| url = http://www.time.com/time/digital/daily/0,2822,621,00.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20000619122406/http://www.time.com/time/digital/daily/0,2822,621,00.html |archivedate = 2000-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The license text is titled "OpenContent License (OPL)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opencontent.org/opl.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981206111937/http://www.opencontent.org/opl.shtml|archivedate=1998-12-06 |title=OpenContent License (OPL)}}&lt;/ref&gt; "OPL" stood for OpenContent Principles and License.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000816071511/http://www.opencontent.org/announce.shtml Updating the OpenContent License and Clarifying a Few Things]&lt;/ref&gt;

This license is not [[License compatibility|compatible]] with most other license (beside [[permissive license]]s) in that it requires derivative works to be licensed under the Open Content License ([[Viral license]]). With the exception of media and handling costs, it forbids charging for copies of a licensed work, but does not otherwise forbid commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19981206111937/http://www.opencontent.org/opl.shtml OpenContent License (OPL)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another license released a year later, also by the [[Open Content Project]], is called the [[Open Publication License]]. The OpenContent as well as the Open Publication license were succeeded by the [[Creative Commons license]]s in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030802222546/http://opencontent.org/ OpenContent is officially closed.

The OCL predates the GFDL (Nov 2002) and Creative Commons (Dec 2002) by over four years, while the improved OPL predates both by over three years. The OCL was developed primarily by me... The improved OPL was written primarily by Eric Raymond after discussions with me, Tim O’Reilly, and others... The OPL was truly innovative in that, in addition to requiring citation of the original author as source, it contained two license options which authors could choose to invoke: one restricts users’ abilities to creative derivative works, while the second restricts users’ abilities to make certain commercial uses of the material. The student of open content licensing will recognize that these are exactly the options that Creative Commons now employs. What may be forgotten is that in version 1.0 of the Creative Commons licenses, Attribution was actually included in the licenses only as an option. In version 2.0 of the CC licenses (May 24, 2004) attribution was standard on every license, and there were two licenses options: one regarding derivative works, and one regarding commercial use. So in terms of high level structure, the OPL was here about five years before CC. ... Actually, the [OCL and OPL] licenses weren’t that great, seeing as I am not a lawyer, and neither was anyone else involved in the creation of the license. The concept was right, and the execution was “good enough,” but Creative Commons (with its excellent lawyers and law school students) created a better legal instrument. As I said on the opencontent.org homepage on Monday June 30, 2003: 'My main goal in beginning OpenContent back in the Spring of 1998 was to evangelize a way of thinking about sharing materials, especially those that are useful for supporting education. ... I’m closing OpenContent because I think Creative Commons is doing a better job of providing licensing options which will stand up in court [and I'm joining] Creative Commons as Director of Educational Licenses. Now I can focus in on facilitating the kind of sharing most interesting to me ... with the pro bono support of really good IP lawyers... The OpenContent License and Open Publication License will remain online for archival purposes in their current locations. However, no future development will occur on the licenses themselves.' ... Anyone interested in a license like this is far better off using a Creative Commons license.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paolo Uccello''' ({{IPA-it|ˈpaːolo utˈtʃɛllo}}; 1397 – 10 December 1475), born '''Paolo di Dono''', was an [[Italy|Italian]] painter and mathematician who was notable for his pioneering work on visual [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in art. In his book ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'' [[Giorgio Vasari]] wrote that Uccello was obsessed by his interest in perspective and would stay up all night in his study trying to grasp the exact vanishing point. While his contemporaries used perspective to narrate different or succeeding stories, Uccello used perspective to create a feeling of depth in his paintings. His best known works are the [[The Battle of San Romano|three paintings]] representing the [[battle of San Romano]], which were wrongly entitled the "Battle of Sant' Egidio of 1416" for a long period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Uccello|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paolo worked in the [[International Gothic|Late Gothic]] tradition, emphasizing colour and pageantry rather than the classical realism that other artists were pioneering. His style is best described as idiosyncratic, and he left no school of followers. He has had some influence on twentieth-century art and literary criticism (e.g., in the "[[Vies imaginaires]]" by [[Marcel Schwob]], "Uccello le poil" by [[Antonin Artaud]] and "O Mundo Como Ideia" by [[Bruno Tolentino]]).

==Early life and training==
The sources for Paolo Uccello’s life are few: [[Giorgio Vasari]]’s biography, written 75 years after Paolo’s death, and a few contemporary official documents. Due to the lack of sources, even his date of birth is questionable. It is believed that Uccello was born in [[Pratovecchio]] in 1397,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Private Life of a Masterpiece]]'', BBC TV&lt;/ref&gt; and his tax declarations for some years indicate that he was born in 1397, but in 1446 he claimed to be born in 1396.&lt;ref&gt;Borsi, Franco &amp; Stefano. ''Paolo Uccello''. pp. 15, 34. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  His father, Dono di Paolo, was a [[barber|barber-surgeon]] from [[Pratovecchio]] near Arezzo; his mother, Antonia, was a high-born Florentine. His nickname ''[[:wiktionary:uccello|Uccello]]'' came from his fondness for painting birds.

From 1412 until 1416 he was apprenticed to the famous sculptor [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]].&lt;ref name="Lloyd-OAO"&gt;Lloyd, Christopher. "Uccello, Paolo." ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online''. Oxford University Press. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Ghiberti was the designer of the doors of the [[Florence Baptistery]] and his workshop was the premier centre for Florentine art at the time. Ghiberti's late-Gothic, narrative style and sculptural composition greatly influenced Paolo. It was also around this time that Paolo began his lifelong friendship with [[Donatello]]. In 1414, Uccello was admitted to the [[painters' guild]], ''Compagnia di San Luca,'' and just one year later, in 1415, he joined the official painter's guild of Florence ''Arte dei Medici e degli Speziali''. Although the young Uccello had probably left Ghiberti's workshop by the mid 1420s, he stayed on good terms with his master and may have been privy to the designs for Ghiberti's second set of Baptistery doors, ''The Gates of Paradise.'' These featured a battle scene "that might well have impressed itself in the mind of the young Uccello," and thus influenced ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Private Life of a Masterpiece BBC TV&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
According to [[Vasari]], Uccello’s first painting was a Saint Anthony between the saints Cosmas and Damianus, a commission for the hospital of Lelmo. Next, he painted two figures in the convent of Annalena. Shortly afterwards, he painted three [[fresco]]es with scenes from ''the life of [[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis]]'' above the left door of the [[Santa Trinita]] church. For the [[Santa Maria Maggiore di Firenze|Santa Maria Maggiore]] church, he painted a fresco of the [[Annunciation]]. In this fresco, he painted a large building with columns in perspective. According to Vasari, people found this to be a great and beautiful achievement because this was the first example of how lines could be expertly used to demonstrate perspective and size. As a result, this work became a model for artists who wished to craft illusions of space in order to enhance the realness of their paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/reader?id=43yEDKzADr0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;pg=GBS.PA75.w.1.2.161.0.1|title=The Lives of the Artists|last=Vasari|first=Giorgio|date=1998-04-02|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191605482|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paolo painted ''the Lives of the [[Church Fathers]]'' in the cloisters of the church of [[San Miniato]], which sat on a hill overlooking Florence. According to Vasari, Paolo protested against the monotonous meals of cheese pies and [[cheese soup]] served by the abbot by running away, and returned to finish the job only after the abbot promised him a more varied diet.&lt;ref&gt;Barolsky, Paul. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-yeEoGzFQIQC&amp;pg=PA24 ''Why Mona Lisa Smiles and Other Tales by Vasari'']. Penn State Press, 2010. p. 24. {{ISBN|0271038527}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Uccello was asked to paint a number of scenes of distempered animals for the house of the Medici. The scene most appreciated by Vasari was his depiction of a fierce lion fighting with a venom-spouting snake. Uccello loved to paint animals and he kept a wide variety of pictures of animals, especially birds, at home. This love for birds is what led to his nickname, Paolo Uccelli (Paul of the birds).

By 1424, Paolo was earning his own living as a painter. In that year, he proved his artistic maturity by painting episodes of the ''Creation and Expulsion,'' which are now badly damaged, for the Green Cloister (''Chiostro Verde'') of [[Santa Maria Novella]] in Florence. Again, this assignment allowed him to paint a large number of animals in a lively manner. He also succeeded in painting trees in their natural colours. This was a skill that was difficult for many of his predecessors, so Uccello also began to acquire a reputation for painting landscapes. He continued with scenes from the [[Deluge (mythology)|Deluge]], the story of [[Noah's Ark]], Noah's sacrifice and Noah's drunkenness. These scenes brought him great fame in Florence.

[[Image:Paolo Uccello 044.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''[[Funerary Monument to Sir John Hawkwood]]'']]

In 1425, Uccello travelled to [[Venice]], where he worked on the mosaics for the façade of [[St Mark's Basilica|San Marco]], which have all since been lost. During this time, he also painted some frescoes in the [[Prato Cathedral]] and [[Bologna]]. Some suggest he visited [[Rome]] with his friend Donatello before returning to Florence in 1431. After he returned, Uccello remained in Florence for most of the rest of his life, executing works for various churches and patrons, most notably the [[Santa Maria del Fiore|Duomo]].

Despite his leave from Florence, interest in Uccello did not diminish. In 1432, the Office of Works asked the Florentine ambassador in Venice to enquire after Uccello’s reputation as an artist.  In 1436, he was given the commission for the monochromatic fresco of ''Sir [[John Hawkwood]]''. This equestrian monument exemplified his keen interest in [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. The [[condottiere]] and his horse are presented as if the fresco was a sculpture seen from below.

It is widely thought that he is the author of the frescoes ''Stories of the Virgin'' and ''Story of Saint Stephen'' in the Cappella dell'Assunta, Florence, so he likely visited nearby [[Prato]] sometime between 1435 and 1440. Later, in 1443, he painted the figures on the clock of the Duomo. In that same year and continuing into 1444, he designed a few stained glass windows for the same church.  In 1444 he was also at work in [[Padua]], and he travelled to Padua again in 1445 at Donatello’s invitation.

[[Image:Paolo Uccello 047b.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Saint George and the Dragon'' (c. 1470), showing Uccello's Gothic influences]]
Back in Florence in 1446, he painted the ''Green Stations of the Cross'', again for the cloister of the church Santa Maria Novella. Around 1447–1454 he painted ''Scenes of Monastic Life'' for the church [[Basilica di San Miniato al Monte|San Miniato al Monte]], Florence.

Around the mid-1450s,&lt;ref name="Lloyd-OAO"/&gt; he painted his three most famous paintings, the panels depicting ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'' for the Palazzo Medici in Florence, commemorating the victory of the Florentine army over the Sienese in 1432. The extraordinarily [[Perspective (graphical)|foreshortened]] forms extending in many planes accentuate Uccello's virtuosity as a draftsman, and provides a controlled visual structure to the chaos of the battle scene.

By 1453, Uccello was married to Tommasa Malifici. This is known because, in that year Donato (named after Donatello), was born. Three years later, in 1456, his wife gave birth to their daughter, Antonia.&lt;ref name="Lloyd-OAO"/&gt; '''Antonia Uccello''' (1456–1491)&lt;ref&gt;Echols, Anne; Marty Williams. ''An annotated index of medieval women''. Markus Wiener Publishers, 1992, p. 61. {{ISBN|0-910129-27-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Carmelite]] nun, whom [[Giorgio Vasari]] called "a daughter who knew how to draw." She was even noted as a "pittoressa", a painter, on her death certificate.  Her style and her skill remains a mystery as none of her work is extant.

From 1465 to 1469, Uccello was in [[Urbino]] with his son Donato working for the Confraternity of Corpus Domini, a brotherhood of laymen. During this time, he painted the [[predella]] for their new altarpiece with the ''Miracle of the Profaned Host.'' (The main panel representing the "Communion of the Apostles" was commissioned to [[Joos van Wassenhove|Justus van Ghent]] and finished in 1474). Uccello's predella is composed of six meticulous, naturalistic scenes related to the antisemitic myth of [[host desecration]], which was based upon an event that supposedly occurred in Paris in 1290. It has been suggested that the subject of the main panel, on which Duke [[Frederick of Montefeltro]] of Urbino appears in the background conversing with an Asian, is related to the antisemitic intention of the predella. However, Federico did allow a small Jewish community to live in Urbino and not all of these scenes are unanimously attributed to Paolo Uccello.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081009120717/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0422/is_4_85/ai_111738112/pg_1 Katz, Dana E., ''The contours of tolerance: Jews and the Corpus Domini Altarpiece in Urbino'']  The Art Bulletin:85 (December 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Uccelo host burning.jpg|thumb|350px|A scene in Paolo Uccello's Corpus Domini [[predella]] (c. 1465–1468), set in a Jewish pawnbroker's home. Blood in the background emanates from [[Host (Holy Communion)|the Host]], which the moneylender has attempted to cook, and seeps under the door. This story first entered the Italian literary tradition via [[Giovanni Villani]] (c. 1280&amp;ndash;1348) and his ''[[Nuova Cronica]]''.]]

In his Florentine tax return of August 1469, Uccello declared, “I find myself old and ailing, my wife is ill, and I can no longer work.” In the last years of his life, Paolo was a lonesome and forgotten man who was afraid of hardship in life. His last known work is ''[[The Hunt in the Forest|The Hunt]]'', c. 1470. He made his testament on 11 November 1475 and died shortly afterwards on 10 December 1475 at the hospital of Florence, at the age of 78. He was buried in his father’s tomb in the Florentine church of [[Santo Spirito, Florence|Santo Spirito]].

With his precise and analytical mind, Paolo Uccello tried to apply a scientific method to depict objects in three-dimensional space. In particular, some of his studies of the perspective foreshortening of the [[torus]] are preserved, and one standard display of drawing skill was his depiction of the [[mazzocchio]].&lt;ref&gt;Emmer, Michele. "Art and Mathematics: The Platonic Solids." Leonardo 15(4): 277-282 (Autumn, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of [[Giulio Carlo Argan|G. C. Argan]]: "Paolo's rigour is similar to the rigour of [[Cubism|Cubists]] in the early 20th century, whose images were more ''true'' when they were less ''true to life''. Paolo constructs space through perspective, and historic event through the structure of space; if the resulting image is unnatural and unrealistic, so much the worse for nature and history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Argan|first=Giulio Carlo|title=Storia dell'arte italiana|year=1968|publisher=Sansoni|volume=2|page=186|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=XIo0AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22paolo+costruisce+lo+spazio%22&amp;dq=%22paolo+costruisce+lo+spazio%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrq_3D7oDZAhXEHZQKHcReAWEQ6AEILTAB|isbn=9788838319136|language=italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perspective in his paintings has influenced many famous painters, such as [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]], to name a few.

==Works==
[[John Pope-Hennessy|Pope-Hennessy]] is far more conservative than the Italian authors: he attributes some of the works below to a "Prato Master" and a "Karlsruhe Master". Most of the dates in the list (taken from Borsi and Borsi) are derived from stylistic comparison rather than from documentation.

'''Priam's Treasure''' is a cache of [[gold]] and other artifacts discovered by classical [[archaeologist]] [[Heinrich Schliemann]]. The majority of the artifacts are currently in the [[Pushkin Museum]] in Moscow.

Schliemann claimed the site to be that of [[Iliad|Homeric]] [[Troy]], and assigned the artifacts to the Homeric king [[Priam]]. This assignment is now thought to be a result of Schliemann's zeal to find sites and objects mentioned in the [[Homeric epics]] which take place in northwestern Turkey. At the time the stratigraphy at Troy had not been solidified, which was done subsequently by the archaeologist [[Carl Blegen]]. The layer in which Priam's Treasure was alleged to have been found was assigned to Troy II, whereas Priam would have been king of Troy VI or VII, occupied hundreds of years later.

== Background ==

With the rise of modern critical history, Troy and the [[Trojan War]] were consigned to the realms of legend. In 1871-73 and 1878–79, Schliemann excavated a hill called [[Hisarlik|Hissarlik]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]], near the town of Chanak ([[Çanakkale]]) in north-western [[Anatolia]], Turkey. Here he discovered the ruins of a series of ancient cities, dating from the [[Bronze Age]] to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period. Schliemann declared one of these cities—at first Troy I, later Troy II—to be the city of Troy, and this identification was widely accepted at that time.

Concerning events on or about May 27, 1873 Schliemann reported:

{{quote|In excavating this wall further and directly by the side of the palace of King Priam, I came upon a large copper article of the most remarkable form, which attracted my attention all the more as I thought I saw gold behind it. … In order to withdraw the treasure from the greed of my workmen, and to save it for archaeology, … I immediately had "paidos" (lunch break) called. … While the men were eating and resting, I cut out the Treasure with a large knife…. It would, however, have been impossible for me to have removed the Treasure without the help of my dear wife, who stood by me ready to pack the things which I cut out in her shawl and to carry them away.}}

Schliemann's oft-repeated story of the treasure being carried by his wife, Sophie, in her shawl was untrue. Schliemann later admitted making it up, saying that at the time of the discovery Sophie was in fact with her family in Athens, following the death of her father.&lt;ref&gt;Moorehead, Caroline (1994).

== The treasure as an art collection ==

Apparently, Schliemann smuggled Priam's Treasure out of Anatolia. The officials were informed when his wife, Sophia, wore the jewels for the public. The Ottoman official assigned to watch the excavation, [[Amin Effendi]], received a prison sentence. The Ottoman government revoked Schliemann's permission to dig and sued him for its share of the gold. Schliemann went on to [[Mycenae]]. There, however, the [[Greek Archaeological Society]] sent an agent to monitor him.

Later Schliemann traded some treasure to the government of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in exchange for permission to dig at Troy again. It is located in the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum]]. The rest was acquired in 1881 by the [[Berlin State Museums|Royal Museums of Berlin]] ''(Königliche Museen zu Berlin)'',&lt;ref&gt;Urice, Stephen K., editor (2007). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_8AddekkdZ8C Law, Ethics and the Visual Arts]'', Kluwer Law International, page 63. {{ISBN|90-411-2517-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Jeanette (2007).

In fact, after the capture of the bunker by the [[Red Army]] Professor [[Wilhelm Unverzagt]] turned the treasure over to the Soviet commendant and thus saved it from plunder and division. The commander promised to guarantee the safety of the art treasures. The artefacts were taken away to [[Moscow]]. During the [[Cold War]], the Soviet government denied any knowledge of the fate of Priam's Treasure. However, in September 1993 the treasure turned up at the [[Pushkin Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Tolstikov, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/8567721.html?dids=8567721&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS&amp;date=Sep+6%2C+1993&amp;author=Atkinson%2C+Rick&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=C1&amp;desc=Trojan+treasure+unlocks+art+war | title=Trojan treasure unlocks art war | date=September 6, 1993 | first=Rick | last=Atkinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia keeps what the West terms the [[looted art]] as compensation for the destruction of Russian cities and looting of Russian museums by [[Nazi Germany]] in [[World War II]]. A 1998 Russian law, the [[Federal Law on Cultural Valuables Displaced to the USSR as a Result of the Second World War and Located on the Territory of the Russian Federation]], legalizes the looting in Germany as compensation and prevents Russian authorities from proceeding to restitutions.

== Authenticity of the treasure ==

There have always been doubts about the authenticity of the treasure. Within the last few decades these doubts have found fuller expression in articles and books.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 1987; Silberman, 1989; Traill, 1997.{{pages needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Princeton Triangle Club''' is a theater troupe at [[Princeton University]]. Founded in 1891, it is the oldest touring collegiate [[musical theater|musical-comedy]] troupe in the [[United States]], and the only co-ed collegiate troupe that takes an original student-written musical on a national tour every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/playblog/?p=2504 |title=PlayBlog Broadway and Theatre News |publisher=Playbill.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-16 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The club is known for its tradition of featuring an all-male [[kickline]] in [[drag (clothing)|drag]].

The troupe presents several shows throughout the year. In September at the end of the University's Freshman Week it presents a revue of popular material from previous years. In autumn it puts on an original student-written musical comedy in [[McCarter Theatre]], then takes this show on tour over the [[Winter holiday season]]. In spring it puts on another original show in a smaller venue. During [[Princeton Reunions|reunions]] after the end of the spring semester, it relaunches the previous autumn's show at McCarter.

Among the club's notable alumni are [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Booth Tarkington]], [[Russel Wright]], [[Joshua Logan]], [[Brooks Bowman]], [[James Stewart|Jimmy Stewart]], [[José Ferrer]], [[Wayne Rogers]], [[Clark Gesner]], [[Jeff Moss]], [[David E. Kelley]], [[Nicholas Hammond]], [[Zachary Pincus-Roth]], and [[Brooke Shields]].

==History==
The history of the Princeton Triangle Club reflects many major social, cultural, economic, political, literary and theatrical trends in the United States during the late 19th and 20th centuries. It also traces the evolution of both undergraduate life and theatrical endeavors at Princeton University. In its century-plus of productions, Triangle has commented upon Princeton-specific topics, from examinations and campus safety to the Honor Code and the eating clubs, in addition to broader movements and events, including war protests, political scandals, women’s rights, and affirmative action. Although Triangle essentially recreates itself every year with an entirely new, full-scale musical-comedy, the club remains committed to its longstanding traditions, from the annual national tour to the kickline, and perpetuates its unique spirit, blending topical humor with collegiate irreverence and outright playfulness.

Triangle’s history is documented in several ways. ''The Long Kickline: A History of the Princeton Triangle Club'', written in 1968 by Donald Marsden '64, provides a detailed chronology of the organization through the production of ''Sham on Wry'' in 1966-67. The senior thesis of Nancy Barnes ’91, ''One Hundred Years and Still Kicking: A History of the Princeton Triangle Club'', updates this written record. Finally, Triangle’s extensive archives in Princeton’s Mudd Library include playbills, musical scores, scripts, reviews, photographs, business correspondence, tour itineraries, scrapbooks, recordings, and much more.

===Beginnings===

The Triangle Club archives begin in 1883 with a production of the Princeton College Dramatic Association; during the next five years the Association presented a number of plays. In keeping with the practice of British and American all-male institutions at the time, women's roles were played by men. Entr'acte music, provided by the Instrumental or Banjo Clubs, consisted of popular dance tunes or operatic excerpts. Student theatricals were performed for the benefit of financially ailing athletic associations, and the sporadic activity of the Dramatic Association can be explained by the fluctuating fortunes of the sports teams.

In 1891 the Dramatic Association joined forces with the University Glee Club to present ''Po-ca-hon-tas'', the first show in the Triangle tradition of musicals written and produced by students. According to a New York review, the reworked John Brougham play featured "new topical songs and local hits" and was well received, both on campus and in a Trenton performance. But the faculty vetoed a proposed New York performance, and over the years, students and administrators would often be at odds over theatrical activities. Nevertheless, the Association visited Trenton once again the following year with ''Katharine'', a Shakespearean spoof marking the first appearance of [[Booth Tarkington]] 1893 in the Triangle records.

The 1893 production, ''The Honorable Julius Caesar'', was again a reworking of Shakespeare. Tarkington, a senior and president of the Dramatic Association, was prominent as both co-author of the book and as actor in the role of Cassius. The show was so successful that it was repeated the following year, with several significant changes. Most importantly, the Princeton University Dramatic Association had been renamed the Triangle Club of Princeton. According to a preview in The New York Times, "several specialties will be introduced, such as tumbling, acrobatic feats, and dancing" and "James E. Wilson of Frohman's company… will coach the club regularly four times a week." If Wilson did indeed coach, the club had its first professional director in its very first show under the name "Triangle."

===Early growth===

Financial problems caused Club members to curtail expenses in 1895. Neither the February production, ''Who's Who'', nor the May offering, ''Snowball'', were written by students, and both had relatively small casts. The following year the Club turned to a recent graduate, Post Wheeler '91, in hopes that his magic touch as co-author of ''The Honorable Julius Caesar'' could be repeated, and they were pleased with the result. ''The Mummy'' (1895–96) was also notable as the first production in Triangle's new home, the Casino, located on the lower campus near the present-day [[McCarter Theatre]] site. Yet another innovation was attempted in 1897. ''A Tiger Lily'', the first Triangle show to be based on Princeton student life, was part of a double bill with ''Lend Me Five Shillings'', a British farce. Since neither show was a great success, the Club returned to the tried and true in 1898 with a revival of ''Po-ca-hon-tas''. ''The Privateer'', presented in 1899, was originally entitled ''The Captain's Kidd Sister'', but the name was changed because the University of Pennsylvania’s [[Mask and Wig|Mask and Wig Club]] had already produced a show about Captain Kidd. The "Privateer March" was the first commercially published Triangle song.

===Traditions begin===

In 1901, with ''The King of Pomeru'', Triangle ventured for the first time to New York, and the next year the club ventured as far as Pittsburgh. After the 1901 New York performance, Franklin B. Morse 1895 proposed a meeting to organize Triangle alumni, who he believed could help promote the Club, build its reputation, arrange the annual tour, collect materials and memorabilia, and generally socialize among themselves. In June of that year, thirty-seven alumni met in Princeton, and the Triangle Board of Trustees was established.

During the first decade of the 20th century, the organization of Triangle became increasingly structured. Printed copies of the script, "for the exclusive use of candidates," first appear in the archives with ''The Man From Where'' (1903–04).

Although ''A Woodland Wedding'' (1899–1900) included a specialty [[skirt dance]], and "The Pony Ballet" was a part of ''Tabasco Land'' (1905–06), ''The Mummy Monarch'''s kickline in 1907 was the first of that tradition to be documented photographically in the Triangle Archives.

===Budding fame and higher standards===

By 1910 the tour had extended as far west as Chicago and St. Louis; printed luncheon menus and newspaper clippings provide evidence of the elaborate social functions that were becoming part of the annual trek. With ''Once in a Hundred Years'' (1912–13), Triangle moved its tour to the Christmas season, again traveling as far west as St. Louis. The following year, President and Mrs. Wilson attended ''The Pursuit of Priscilla''’s Washington matinee performance; the First Family then hosted a reception for Triangle at the White House.

''The Evil Eye'' (1915-16) had a distinguished pair of neophyte authors: Edmund Wilson '16 wrote the book, and F. Scott Fitzgerald '17 was responsible for the lyrics. Although he was never a cast member in a Triangle production, Fitzgerald wrote three shows for the Club between 1914 and 1917.

During 1917-18, a four man Triangle troupe toured Europe to entertain the soldiers stationed there for World War I. After the year hiatus, the club became active again with a revival of ''The Honorable Julius Caesar''. The first post-war tour occurred when ''The Isle of Surprise'' was taken on the road during Christmas break of 1919. This show marked a change in attitude toward Triangle productions. In the program, Club president Erdman Harris '20 described the new production: "We hope that a new day has dawned, that ‘Jazz’ will be forever relegated to a back seat, that Broadway will cease to be the idol of those who create the shows, that their staging shall be done in Princeton by Princeton men, and that the authorities and graduates will approve what is being done to elevate the standard of a society whose value in student life has been seriously questioned."

In the spring of 1922, Triangle staged George Bernard Shaw's ''The Devil's Disciple''. This production marked a milepost in the Club's history, for its three female roles were actually played by women.  Sets for this production were designed and painted by [[Russel Wright]] during his freshman year, marking one of the few times that a freshman was ever allowed to join Triangle.

===Professionalization and emerging stars===

During the early 1920s, New York performances began to be booked at the Metropolitan Opera House, although initially there was some concern whether the Club would be able to fill such a large theatre and whether the men's voices would be strong enough to be heard properly.  Late in 1923, there were negotiations concerning a possible radio broadcast, and in the same year Triangle's music publisher, J. Church Co., corresponded with the Victor Talking Machine Co. about a trial recording. But the major event during this decade was the planning and construction of McCarter Theatre for Triangle Club. The completed theatre opened on February 21, 1930, with the Triangle Club’s ''The Golden Dog''. McCarter replaced the long-controversial Casino, which burned on January 8, 1924.

Here began the Golden Period for which the Triangle Club became famous, in terms of its eventual contribution of outstanding talent to the Broadway theatre and Hollywood. Within a few years the Club would send forth into these professional realms [[Erik Barnouw]] '29; [[Norris Houghton|C. Norris Houghton]], [[Joshua Logan]], and [[Myron McCormick]], all Class of 1931; [[James Stewart]] '32; [[José Ferrer]] '33; and [[Nick Foran]] '34.

The 1935 show, ''Stags at Bay'', featured "East of the Sun (and West of the Moon)," written by [[Brooks Bowman]], which would become the most popular and longest-lasting national hit ever to come out of the Triangle Club. Recorded by [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Louis Armstrong]], among many others, "East of the Sun" still provides the club with royalties.  Other songs from the same show, by Bowman, included "Love and Dime" and "Will Love find a Way?."

===Difficulties in the Depression years===

With ''The Tiger Smiles'' (1930–31), Triangle writers returned to a Princeton town and gown setting for the first time since ''When Congress Came to Princeton'' (1908–09). The production was well received, but the Club was already beginning to feel the effects of the Great Depression. In October 1930, the Program Manager reported, "Due to the financial depression, the business of getting ads is a rather difficult one just now." By the following year economic conditions had begun to affect the tour. South Orange reported poor ticket sales, and the local alumni chairman was concerned with keeping down the cost of stagehands; in Pittsburgh, a poor house and lack of entertainment were attributed to the weak stock market. ''When It's the Valet'' (1932–33) was ready to tour, local alumni groups were either unwilling to sponsor a show or unable to guarantee an adequate sum to cover expenses, let alone show a profit. The Club's Graduate Board sought aid from alumni in underwriting the show, but individual contributions were equally difficult to come by.

Throughout the mid-thirties, Triangle continued to tour in spite of the Depression, but there were rumblings of discontent from both the Graduate Board of the Club and the University administration. In a 1934 meeting with President Dodds, the Board indicated concern about the financial condition of McCarter Theatre; Triangle profits were insufficient to keep McCarter operating in the black, a situation that would become increasingly serious as the decade wore on. President Dodds had also heard alumni criticism about poor acting and an apparent lack of coaching in connection with the latest show. Yet he remained confident that Triangle could play an important role on campus. Later that year, Club Manager Stryker Warren '35 received a stern letter from Dean of the College Christian Gauss. Gauss had considered canceling the Christmas tour, first because of financial considerations, and then because of alumni criticism, which "in nearly every case… came as the result of the excessive drinking on the part of a few of your men." Nevertheless, the Dean concluded by wishing "you and all the officers and members of the Club a highly successful trip, a very merry Christmas and a happy New Year."

At a 1937 Board meeting there was discussion about the lack of good voices in Triangle. Alumni as well as Board members had noted this situation, and it was suggested that "there must be someone in the Glee Club who could at least be drafted to sing, so that a song could be heard beyond the footlights." Another complaint came from a Louisville alumnus early in 1938, who wrote, "I am not crazy about the Triangle Club bringing in certain dirty lines about ‘buying a drink’ and ‘the Knights of the Garter,’ etc.…. Personally I would prefer to see the young men get properly soused and have to be poured on the train than to use [these] lines."

Another change in tradition came during the 1941-42 academic year, when Triangle produced ''Ask Me Another'', its first show in revue format. Then, at a Board meeting in September 1943, Graduate Treasurer B. Franklin Bunn '07 announced that there would be no Triangle Club activities for the duration of the war. The University assumed control of McCarter Theatre during this period, and the building was leased by the military for trainees’ use on campus.

===Post-war comeback===

In November 1945, the University Committee on Undergraduate Activities issued a report describing Triangle as "perhaps the most controversial of all undergraduate extracurricular activities. Despite obvious shortcomings, the Club affords many valuable opportunities to the undergraduate body and plays a very real part in alumni relations. According, it should be reestablished at the first possible moment." The first post-war show, ''Clear the Track'', opened in December 1946 and even managed a seven-city tour. But Triangle was beset with problems the following year for ''All Rights Reserved'' (1947–48). The Daily Princetonian reported, "All Rights pretty nearly weren't reserved. A play by the same name had fizzled on Broadway for a bare month, in 1934, and the petulant playwright threatened to sue. Hasty consultation with a Broadway lawyer revealed that the author could not possibly win the suit and that matter was closed." The club resolved tricky labor questions by employing union stagehands and music-hirelings, putting the later to work first in Philadelphia, where they were made to earn their fee by playing with the regular orchestra, and then in Washington, where they provided the intermission music.

Despite ongoing debate in the 1950s about the club’s obligations to theatrical professionalism, as well as its questionable effect on the University’s reputation, Triangle continued to reach a wider audience through greater media exposure. In 1948, ''All in Favor'' was broadcast on WNBC-TV, becoming the first college show to appear on the new medium of television. The entire score of ''Too Hot for Toddy'' (1950–51) was recorded, and members of the cast appeared on ''The Kate Smith Show'' and ''Ed Sullivan's The Toast of the Town''. Club productions appeared on The ''Ed Sullivan Show'' from 1950 to 1957; its host wrote to Triangle President Charles Robinson, "The Princeton Triangle Club has an annual appointment on our stage, so long as I’m on TV."

Finally, in 1953, a memorandum of agreement was drawn up between Princeton University and the Trustees of the Triangle Club abrogating the McCarter agreement of the 1920s. The Club had simply been unable to cover the operating expenses and pay the taxes of the Theatre. A full-time general manager was hired for McCarter, and the University, which had been underwriting Triangle's losses, agreed to cancel the Club's debts.

===The Lyon era===

''Spree de Corps'' (1955–56) marked the debut of Milton Lyon as Triangle director. From 1955 until his death forty years later, Lyon would direct all but a handful of Triangle's original productions.

Student apathy toward extracurricular activities began to affect Triangle toward the end of the 1950s. At a meeting in October 1958, the Board noted a very small turnout for the previous month's auditions. It was decided that more on-campus publicity would help, and as part of this effort Triangle Junior was formed, a group of seven club members who performed favorite Triangle songs at various receptions and functions. Over the following years, this small group would undergo periodic name changes, being known as ''Triangle Ding!'' and ''Triangle Bit Parts'' before returning to ''Ding!'', as it is called today.

With the gradual elimination of passenger trains in the late 1950s, the club began touring by bus. Early in 1960 there was a proposal to produce a motion picture on the Triangle Club, but a Hollywood writers' strike and possible heavy expenses brought an end to this publicity idea. However, Triangle did embark on its first European tour that summer; the Club performed ''Breakfast in Bedlam'' (1959–60) at French and German bases of the American army. ''Tour de Farce'' (1961–62) became perhaps the most widely toured show: performances in Pasadena and San Francisco marked the first time the show had been seen live on both coasts, and then troupe members again went to Europe that summer to perform at US Army bases.

''Funny Side Up'' (1963–64) was billed as the 75th anniversary show in spite of the fact that number seventy was ''Tour de Farce'', produced only two years earlier. ''Funny Side Up'' did not have a smooth start: the writers were slow to produce material, and the trustees even considered the possibility that there would be no show. Because of the diamond jubilee, twenty-one songs from earlier shows were made a part of the program. The tour of ''Funny Side Up'' included several southern stops, and the Birmingham visit became problematic when Triangle was booked into a segregated theatre. After some strongly worded letters from Board members, it was determined that the performance would either be cancelled or moved to a non-segregated house.

===Coeducation and other changes===

''A Different Kick'' (1968–69) was a Triangle milestone, featuring the first female undergraduate to be cast in a Club show—Sue Jean Lee '70, a junior in the Critical Languages Program. The University's shift to coeducation the next fall would have a profound effect on Triangle. ''Call a Spade a Shovel'' (1969–1970) featured six women in a seventeen-member cast. The social and political commentary of the show, most especially its anti-Vietnam War tones, which reflected the views of the Vietnam Veteran who was President and much of the country, unleashed an unprecedented storm of alumni protest and caused a mass audience walk-out at the Grosse Pointe tour performance.

This incident, along with growing budgetary and logistical concerns, caused the Board of Trustees to revise its production schedule. As per the May 1970 Report of the Board’s New Directions Committee, there was to be neither a December show nor a Christmas tour; instead, a spring show was promised, to be followed by a short tour. ''Cracked Ice'' opened in April 1971, was repeated for alumni in June, but did finally tour the following December. To cut expenses, the cast and crew stayed in private homes rather than hotels, and non-union halls were booked.

The Princeton Triangle Workshop made its debut in November 1972 with a presentation of ''The Fantasticks'' at the Princeton Inn Theater; the following March the Workshop produced ''Transitions'', described as "five original plays and a multimedia extravaganza," in Wilcox Hall. This began a 25-year tradition of smaller fall productions to complement the full-scale, original spring shows. The fall productions of 1978, ''Happily Ever After'', and 1979, ''String of Pearls'', were both written by undergraduates. For the 1981 spring show, Triangle writers returned to the very roots of the club and based their book musical, ''Bold Type'', on Booth Tarkington's novel, ''A Gentleman from Indiana''.

The 1981 tour again returned to California, but with a revue of Triangle favorites, ''Fool's Gold'', rather than the spring show. The following year Triangle hired Miriam Fond, the first female director in the Club's history. Triangle finally found a permanent home for its fall productions when ''The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas'' opened at the Triangle Broadmead Theatre in November 1984. In the 1980s, the Club began to present produce revues of the best of Triangle early in the fall to introduce the freshman class to the organization.

===Centennial===

The Club's centennial was celebrated in 1991 with a series of campus events throughout the year, including the spring show entitled ''The Older, the Better'', a large Firestone Library exhibition of more than 850 items from the Triangle Archives, and a fall reunion weekend of parties and performances. But how could the centennial celebration be held in 1991 when the fiftieth anniversary show was ''Once Over Lightly'', produced in 1938-39? After much debate, it had been decided that the first show in the true Triangle tradition of original work was ''Po-ca-hon-tas'' in 1891; hence the choice of 1991 for the one-hundredth anniversary.

===The 2nd century===

In the late 1990s, the production schedule reverted to its original format, in which the McCarter show was presented in the fall of each academic year, followed a month later by that show’s tour. This change meant that in 1997-1998 the Club needed to generate two-full length musicals in fifteen months, almost twice the writing load of previous years. In September 1997, Triangle began a writing workshop to coordinate the efforts of the writers; this program was enormously successful, producing ''In Lava and War'' in April 1998 and ''101 Damnations'' in November 1998. By the spring of 1999, the corps of 21 writers had been so prolific that Triangle presented an extra, original spring show at [[Theatre Intime]], entitled ''The Rude Olympics''. The 1999-2000 season saw the hundredth anniversary of the kickline in ''The Blair Arch Project'' (November 1999), as well as Triangle’s return to Theatre Intime in May with ''The Rude Olympics II: American Booty''. ''Puns of Steel'' (2000–2001) became the first Club show to record its score on a CD.

===Recent developments===

Since the start of the 21st century, the Club has continued the production schedule begun in the 1990s, with a Freshman Week show in September, McCarter show in November, tour in late January to early February, spring show in late April / early May, and a reprise of the McCarter show in June.  The smaller-scale spring show has moved from Theater Intime to the Whitman Theater.  Recent years have seen the refinement of the Club's infrastructure, with continued development of the writing workshop and the shaping of a more active business team under the name "TriBiz."  The Club continues to receive a high level of regional recognition, with the 2007 fall show ''A Turnpike Runs Through It'' appearing in ''[[The New York Times]]''.

'''Pulchri Studio''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]:"For the study of beauty") is a Dutch art society, art institution and art studio based in [[The Hague]] ('s-Gravenhage), [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=Sillevis&gt;{{cite book|last=Sillevis|first=John|title=Dutch Drawings from the Age of Van Gogh: From the Collection of the Haags Gemeentemuseum|year=1993|publisher=Premier Book Marketing Ltd.|isbn=0-915577-24-0|pages=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=b4A-T6fEJsG5hAfPvsHCBQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;hl=cs&amp;id=Zh9QAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Pulchri+Studio+1847&amp;q=Latin#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This institute began in 1847 at the home of painter [[Netherlandse kunstschilders|Lambertus Hardenberg]]. Since 1893 the club has its residence in the villa at ''Lange Voorhout 15'' in The Hague, which is currently a brownish aubergine color. There are accepted as members artistically working members (painters, sculptors and photographers) and art lovers. The members will be selected from a given by the general committee.

An artist membership allows the artist to exhibit his own works in the galleries of the Company. These so-called sales exhibitions have passed since the founding of the association until today integral part of this institution! Art lovers have to be invited by other members. The association leases its properties even to nonmembers, too.

==Origins==
[[File:Paul Gabriël - Molen bij een plas.jpg|thumb|Paul Gabriël: Windmill in a pond.]]
The unspoilt countryside around even the rich coastal town of [[The Hague]]&lt;ref&gt;At that time was The Hague was considered the most beautiful village in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt; with its rural environment and the unspoiled landscape and nature and the nearby fishing village of [[Scheveningen]] attracted many young artists.&lt;ref&gt;The small spots like Loosduinen, Voorburg and Wassenaar were quite popular because of their virginity.&lt;/ref&gt; The artists wanted to be far away from the state-run requirements of art ([[neo-classicism]]) and liked to decide their own way. The model was the successful artist colony of [[Barbizon]] south of Paris in the forest of [[Fontainebleau]]. The unaltered life of the people and the unspoilt polders and the [[North Sea]] coast played an important role. They wanted to be far away from the beginning in the Netherlands industrialisation in [[Amsterdam]] and [[Rotterdam]].

==History==
[[File:Diligentia - 's-Gravenhage - 20091090 - RCE.jpg|thumb|Diligentia.]]
[[File:Interieur, overzicht van de antichambrezaal met kunstexpositie - 's-Gravenhage - 20407039 - RCE.jpg|thumb|Exhibition with a view to the entrance.]]
Following the abolition of the [[patronage]] for artist they were searching for a new way. The city of 's-Gravenhage (The Hague) with its surroundings and the coastal landscape of the [[North Sea]] at [[Scheveningen]] became attractive for young painters. In 1847 with the establishment of the association Pulchri Studio such a new approach has been emerged. These artist's association is a typical Dutch development.&lt;ref&gt;In the Netherlands the concept of ''societät'' or ''cooperative'' was practised. They are known as the guild of Sin Lucas, which was for the Painters. At the end of the eighteenth century they discontonued.&lt;/ref&gt; It stands in the continuation of the tradition of the old academies of the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;The old academy has nothing in common with the new one.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Since the rule of Napoleon these academies were completely under state control and the local teaching conception. And these new cooperatives meant the outbreak of these artists, linked to the freedom of genre and color palette. They wanted to determine the expressiveness of the colors by themselves.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pulchri Studio developed for the resident artists' colonies of The Hague, Laren and the estate Oosterbeek the center and was also the linking of creativity, the contact with each other and the world outside, too.&lt;/ref&gt; A special role has played gatherings, which were called ''art considerations'' (Kunstbeschouwingen). They offered the artists the opportunity to present their own works the other members and to exchange information with the other painters. This way of handling the works creators as an ''Apprentice'' with other artists as ''Master'' has been the guarantee of the success of the Hague School.&lt;ref&gt;The Hague School ultimately became synonymous with the famous [[Dutch Impressionism]]. The [[Amsterdam School|Amsterdam Impressionism]], as [[Allebé|School of Allebé]] references, was ultimately the continuation of this trend.&lt;/ref&gt; The location served as a studio and workshop. Right at the beginning this cooperative had no exhibition rooms. Alternatively the painters participated in the two or three-yearly ''Exhibition of Living Masters''.&lt;ref&gt;This exhibition had been a touring exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This exhibition at the Kingdom of the united Netherlands was very important. She was the only way for the still unknown painters to be become known at all in the home.&lt;/ref&gt; – In 1882, [[Vincent van Gogh]] participated in such an art appreciation along with Bosboom and Henkes. The location had the function of the social contact to the native population. It wasn't only a place of social encounter, but at the same time it offered to the artists the opportunity to communicate with collectors and dealers. – This was very important.

Among the founding members of ''Pulchri'' has been [[Netherlandse kunstschilder|Lambertus Hardenberg]], [[Willem Roelofs]], [[Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch]] and [[Bartholomeus Johannes van Hove]]. In 1847, Van Hove has been the first chairman of the artists association. Short time later King [[William II of the Netherlands|Willem II.]] took over the [[patron]]age.&lt;ref&gt;This attached particular importance to the location seat of the government and the king.&lt;/ref&gt; A short time later [[Johannes Bosboom]], [[Jozef Israels]], [[Hendrik Willem Mesdag]], [[Jan Weissenbruch]] and some lesser-known artists joined Pulchri. Subsequent significant members are also [[Jan Sluyters]], [[Paul Citroen]] and [[Jan Willem Sluiter|Willy Sluiter]].

Many painters, who are today attributed to the [[Hague School]], had position on the board and made this cooperative to a stronghold: Bosboom was chairman from 1852 to 1853, Israëls from 1875–1878 and Mesdag from 1898–1907. But even [[Jacob Maris]] and [[Willem Maris]], [[Anton Mauve]], [[Roelofs]] and [[Jan Weissenbruch]] were members of the executive committee. They were responsible for the ''drawing room'', the ''art considerations'' or the ''social meetings''.

The growing membership forced the organizers to expand and in 1901 it was moved to the building on the Lange Voorhout 15.

In 2004, a number of works from Pulchri were stolen, later recovered in 2007.&lt;ref name="Cirque de Pepin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cirque de Pepin|title=H.M.S. is back|url=http://www.cirque.nl/info/news_archive.html|work=OKT 2007|publisher=Cirque.nl|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The two rival cooperatives==
[[File:A town on the river Vecht by Theophile de Bock (1851-1904).jpg|thumb|Théophile de Bock (1895/1905): A town on the river Vecht – private collection.]]
During its turbulent history were attempts at secession or counter companies. None of them should never attain the importance of Pulchri Studion. But this is an indication that politics of these cooperative is not always met with broad approval. One of these countermovements is the [[Haagse Kunstkring]]. In 1891 this cooperative was created by the painter [[Théophile de Bock]] and the architect [[Paul du Rieu]].&lt;ref&gt;Haagse Kunstkring means loosely translated: ''[[The Hague Art Circle]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; It has remained until now and has been awarded to its centenary with the medal of the city of The Hague.

In The Hague in the year 1884 a smaller Artists Association – [[Arti et Industriae]] was established. Their aim is to promote Dutch art craft and has a pension fund, too. From the beginning it is more oriented towards the subject to industry and industrial progress. So it has a completely different orientation than the Hague School with her Pulchri Studio, which wanted to immortalize the untouched nature and the genuine life in the country, the podern and on the coast. – Thus it should never attain the significance and charisma as Pulchri Studio. Arti et Industriae had set oneself the goal of contact and coordination. They organizes exhibitions, too. However, their existence was secured by the proximity to the seat of government.

==Pulchri Studio and the Art Academy==
From the Hague School and the [[Royal Academy of Art, The Hague]] went a favorable effect on the development of the artists association ''Pulchri Studio''. This society took over the function for the promotion of the fine arts. In this environment were excellent teachers and students.&lt;ref&gt;In 1682, this Academy was initially founded as a school of art and it is the oldest [[art school]] of the Netherlands, too. Through a private initiative, it has been established.&lt;/ref&gt; The place of The Hague and its surroundings was and is important because of the seat of the government. At the Art Academy Blosboom, Willem Maris, Johan Hendrik Weissenbruch and Georg Breitner were also trained.

==Pulchri Studio and the Hollandsche Teekenmaatschappij==
The cooperative of Pulchri Studio was open to new technics in painting in the fine art. This resulted in the panel painting to another movement within the Dutch Impressionism, the Hague School.

In [[Bruxelles|Brussels]] in the year 1855 the Society for [[watercolour]]-painting, the "Société Belge des watercolorist" was founded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rkd.nl/en/ RKD Netherlands Institute for Art History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704121422/https://rkd.nl/en/ |date=4 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arba-esa.be/ Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts de Bruxelles]&lt;/ref&gt; She was quite successful. This movement was an expression of social and country-specific implementation of the very successful work of [[The Royal Watercolour Society]] to London. Precisely because of the contacts with the environment of the "Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts de Bruxelles", the watercolours were attractive again as a version of the painting for artists. Indeed, this watercolour technique had reached their third heyday from the end of the 19th century to the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;An important influence came from [[August Macke]] and [[Paul Klee]]. During their tunisian travel in 1914 they had chosen this painting technique in [[watercolour]]s. The artists wanted to show the very bright luminous intensity over there.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kandisky from the expressionist community [[Blauer Reiter|Blue Rider]] from [[München|Munich]] also took care of the watercolour painting. As part of the art movement of [[avant-garde]] he led the watercolour painting to a new meaning.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 January 1878 the ''[[Hollandsche Teekenmaatschappij]]'' (in English: Dutch Drawing Society) was founded. Its founding members belonged to the core of the ''Hague School'' – the movement of the ''Dutch Impressionism'' and thus the Pulchri Studio.
The society was so organized that it was independent, but closely linked to Pulchri Studio remained. Its honorary members included painters from Belgium, Germany and Italy.

In 1901, this society ceased to exist.

==Policy and Pulchri Studio==
The Society Pulchri wasn't as conservative as [[Arti et Amicitiae]] to [[Amsterdam]]. Yes, they even rejected the traditional painting styles.

In the royal capital of 's-Gravenhage (The Hague) his caused an uproar and a political issue, too. By the king [[William III of the Netherlands|Willem III]] Hermanus Koekkoek had received a medal in recognition of a work. From Pulchri came the objection that this painting would no longer correspond to the current state of the art.&lt;ref&gt;In this context, the chapter ''A world of light'', P. 7 – 32, ''Impressionism, an international art movement from 1860 to 1920'' referred by Norma Broude is very informative. Here it can be seen how much the conflict was between the '''shaking off''' the [[neoclassicism]] and [[romanticism]] and the '''retention''' of the tradition of craft and the old ways. – The [[landscape painting]] of [[Dutch Golden Age|"The 1. Golden Age of the Netherlands"]] is precisely that tradition, which was rejected by them.&lt;/ref&gt; – In public, the Hague School took the opposite position and stood against the official art policy of the Dutch king. This was notably represented by Artzt, de Bock, Bosboom, Israëls, Jacob and Willem Maris, Mauve, Mesdag and Neuhuys.

In addition they made known that neither one may send them a tender for an art competition nor they will take part in a competition any more.&lt;ref&gt;One relied on the strength of Puchri Studion and her reputation in the country and abroad.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Bley, Britta: Vom Staat zur Nation (in German) – From the state to the nation, page 124-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the circles that represented the new, radical painting style of impressionism or were only open, it was believed to have triggered something. In those days the queen tried to calm things down by their commitment to Pulchi. There was a no significant change in the policy of the king. – The disappointment was very big and they had to choose their own way.&lt;ref&gt;The existence of Pulchri today and the very well known [[Museum Mesdag]] was the best proof.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revival after the war ==
After the Second World War was ''Pulchri Studio'' in disrepute: In 1943, the executive committee had submitted the order from Berlin to join the Reich-Chamber of Culture (Reichskulturkammer). In the Kingdom of the Netherlands this act was regarded as an act of collaboration. – After 1945 the chairman at that time, Willy Sluiter, was dismissed. In 1996 Queen [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Beatrix]] just took the patronage of this artists association and helped her back to the traditional reputation and importance in the art scene of The Hague and the Netherlands.

{{Nihongo|'''Rokushō'''|緑青}} is a traditional [[Japan|Japanese]] chemical compound used in the [[niiro]] process for artificially inducing [[patina|patination]] in decorative non-ferrous metals, especially several copper alloys, with the results being metals of the [[irogane]] class.  These "colour metals," virtually unknown outside [[Japan]] until the late 19th century, have achieved some popularity in craft circles in other parts of the world since then.

==Usage==
Rokushō is used to treat a number of metals, including raw natural copper, which holds impurities, purified copper, and copper alloy mixes with two to five metals, to produce irogane metals, including: [[shakudō]], an alloy of copper and gold, which becomes black to dark blue-violet; [[shibuichi]], an alloy of fine silver and copper (in a higher percentage than sterling), which turns grey to misty [[Aquamarine (color)|aquamarine]] or other shades of blue to green; [[kuromido]] which becomes dark coppery black.  

Rokushō was generally used to patinate all types of [[mokume-gane]] ("wood grain metal") as well. 

Although other patination agents can be used on these metals, some artisans prefer the rich colors achieved with traditional rokushō in the niiro process.

These metals are becoming increasingly popular in high-end artistic jewelry, especially in bi-metals (a layer of the alloy fused to another metal such as sterling).  Because rokushō has a dramatically different effect on sterling silver than on the alloys typically fused to it in bi-metals, a common technique in art jewelry is to engrave through the alloy layer in a pattern to reveal the silver underneath prior to patination.  This provides a rich contrast in color, highlighting the pattern.

==Formulation==
The formulae for rokushō are not published widely or freely, but passed on in the Japanese craft tradition.  However, some scholars have analysed samples of the material.  

Premixed rokushō can be purchased outside Japan through specialty jewelry suppliers. Additionally, several different formulas have been proposed to replicate the traditional product for those who prefer to make their own:

* In a container made of glass, porcelain, or copper, dissolve 6g copper acetate, 2g calcium carbonate, and 2g sodium hydroxide in 150ml water. After a week, siphon or decant the clear liquid from the top; just before use, add another 2g copper sulfate.{{clarify|reason=1) text says "add another 2g copper sulfate", but this is the first instance of copper sulfate in the recipe, 2) calcium carbonate is not soluble in water|date=June 2015}}
* Dissolve 4g [[copper acetate]], 1g [[copper nitrate]], 1g [[cupric chloride]], and 4g [[copper sulfate]] in 1 liter of distilled water.
* Dissolve 60g copper acetate and 60g copper sulfate in a 2 liter solution of white vinegar diluted 5-12% with water.

Rokusho is not used alone, but mixed with one or more other chemicals.  Further, metal to be processed is cleaned in advance of treatment, using a mild acid bath (oxalic or sulfuric acids are frequently used), scrubbing with [[daikon radish]] or pumice, and / or a surface abrasive, and often treated after patination also.

[[File:Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland logo.svg|100px|thumb|Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland logo]]
The '''Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland''' ('''RIAS''') is the [[professional body]] for [[architects]] in [[Scotland]].

==History==
Previously the (lapsed) '''Architectural Institute of Scotland''', it was re-founded in 1916 as the '''Incorporation of Architects in Scotland''' by architect [[Robert Rowand Anderson]] (1834–1921) from his sick bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=200041 |title=(Sir) Robert Rowand Anderson, DSA Architect Biography Report |work=Dictionary of Scottish Architects |accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson donated his [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[townhouse]] in [[Edinburgh]] to be used as its home, where the organisation remains to this day.  It was given its first [[Royal charter]] in 1922, followed by a second in 1929.

==Organisation==
The RIAS comprises six chapters across Scotland:- 
*[[Aberdeen Society of Architects]] (ASA)
*[[Dundee Institute of Architects|Dundee Institute of Architects (DIA)]]
*Edinburgh Architectural Association (EAA)
*Glasgow Institute of Architects (GIA)
*Inverness Architectural Association (IAA)
*Stirling Society of Architects (SSA)
Associate membership is available to anyone registered as an architect who lives and works in Scotland.

The Incorporation is an independent body representing Architects working in Scotland although it consults regularly with the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) regarding UK-wide professional issues.  It lobbies Scottish Ministers and the [[Scottish Government]] directly on relevant issues.

The President is Willie Watt and the Treasurer and Secretary is Neil Baxter.  The Incorporation is run by an elected National Council comprising representatives of individual Chapters and nationally elected members.

The Incorporation offers accreditation in specialist fields including historic building conservation and environmental sustainability.

==RIAS Award for Architecture==

{{main|RIAS Andrew Doolan Award for Architecture}}

The RIAS award was founded in 2002 by the architect Andrew Doolan, whose work included the Point Hotel in Edinburgh.  The award is given to the best new building in Scotland, as judged by a jury of assessors. The value of the prize is £25,000, making it the largest prize for architecture in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. Initially the prize money came from Doolan, but following his death in 2004 there were doubts as to whether the award could continue. The responsibility now lies with his mother Mrs Margaret Doolan who now patronises the award and from 2005 the award has been renamed the "RIAS Andrew Doolan Award for Architecture" in his memory.  Winners have included: the [[Enric Miralles]]' [[Scottish Parliament building]]; [[Bennetts Associates]]' University of Edinburgh [[Informatics Forum]]; and Reiach &amp; Hall's [[Pier Arts Centre]] in [[Orkney]].  The [[Maggie's Centres]] in [[Dundee]], [[Kirkcaldy]] and [[Inverness]] have all been nominated, with the one in Inverness by [[Page\Park Architects]] winning the award in 2006.

==Fellows of the RIAS==

For notable elected Fellows of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (FRIAS) see [[:Category:Fellows of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland]].

==RIAS Publishing==

RIAS publications include a series of architectural guides covering Scotland aimed at the general reader. Although smaller in size and more limited in scope, the aims are similar to [[Nikolaus Pevsner]]'s eponymous series of [[Pevsner Architectural Guides|Architectural Guides]] to England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. Some volumes were published under RIAS's imprint, The Rutland Press. Others were co-published with [[Mainstream Publishing]]. Several volumes (marked *) have been updated as new editions, but not all volumes are currently in print.

==Plot==
In December 1941, just before the entry of the United States into [[World War II]], an American agent from the [[Office of Naval Intelligence|Naval Intelligence Office]] (Cusack) arrives in [[Shanghai]] to find his friend Conner ([[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]]) was recently murdered. Determined to find out who killed Conner and why, he begins working at the Herald using the alias Paul Soames, a Nazi-sympathizer cover he used while stationed in [[Berlin]]. He meets Anthony Lan-Ting ([[Chow Yun-Fat]]) an influential crime lord and Captain Tanaka ([[Ken Watanabe]]) at the German embassy in Shanghai, during an invitation-only event. He later befriends Anthony when he saves him during an attack on Japanese officers by the Chinese Resistance at a night club.

Paul realizes that it was Anthony's wife, Anna ([[Gong Li]]) who actually organized the attack and is the leader of the resistance. He then decides to help her pass on messages. After finally meeting up with Conner's contact in the Japanese Consulate, Paul finds out that Conner had an affair with a Japanese girl named Sumiko ([[Rinko Kikuchi]]) and after searching her place, Paul uncovers numerous photos, which Conner took, in a darkroom nearby. Some of the photos include Captain Tanaka, other Japanese officers and the [[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|aircraft carrier ''Kaga'']].

Unconvinced that Sumiko betrayed Conner, he determines to find the girl and get the answers he seeks. After a few more encounters with Anna, Anthony, Captain Tanaka, and investigating at an opium house, Paul realizes that Sumiko was Captain Tanaka's lover and was seduced by Conner to spy for him. Paul's cover is blown when Conner's contact is arrested, and Paul gets interrogated by Captain Tanaka regarding the whereabouts of Sumiko, whose location he does not know. After being released, Anna takes Paul to a safe house where she has been hiding Sumiko, who is on the verge of death due to withdrawal from opium and possibly other illnesses.

Outside, Anthony Lan-Ting arrives with Captain Tanaka who he gave away the location of the safe house. It was the only way for him to save Anna from arrest. Inside the safe house, Tanaka informs Paul that the Japanese fleet started [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacking Pearl Harbor]] one hour earlier and that the [[History of Shanghai#World War II and the Japanese Occupation|invasion of Shanghai]] is also underway. Tanaka admits to killing Conner, but only out of jealousy as he found out about Conner and Sumiko. A visibly distraught Tanaka asks for Paul's help in administering drugs to ease Sumiko's death. After Sumiko dies, everyone gets ready to leave, but Tanaka wants to question Anna which infuriates Anthony. He then guns down Tanaka's bodyguards and seriously wounds Tanaka himself. Before he can kill Tanaka, Anthony is fatally wounded by a dying bodyguard.

Leaving behind a wounded Tanaka, Paul drives the Lan-Tings away through the burning streets of Shanghai and with his last words, Anthony asks Paul to take Anna out of Shanghai, which he successfully does. Before getting on the ship, Paul and Anna encounter Tanaka once again, but Tanaka decides not to acknowledge them, perhaps because Paul helped him at Sumiko's deathbed and spared his life after being shot. It is revealed later that both Paul and Anna, at some point, returned to Shanghai.&lt;ref name="firstshowing20071127"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2007/11/27/john-cusack-and-mikael-hafstrom-together-again-in-shanghai/|title=John Cusack and Mikael Hafstrom Together Again in Shanghai|last=Billington|first=Alex|date=2007-11-27|publisher=FirstShowing.net|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The film was originally intended to be shot on location in [[Shanghai]]; however, due to the controversial time period in which the film is set, [[The Weinstein Company]]'s permits were revoked by the Chinese government one week prior to the scheduled start of filming. Thus, the film crew had to relocate to [[Bangkok]], Thailand, where an elaborate two-block set was built.&lt;ref name="Shanghai Hits Theaters in China First"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.cri.cn/6666/2010/05/06/2521s567927.htm |title="Shanghai" to Hit Chinese Screens in June |last=|first=zhanglin |date=2010-05-06|publisher=CRIEnglish.com|accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Shanghai'' received negative reviews. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a 4% score, an average rating of 4.2/10, based on 23 reviews. The site's consensus states: "''Shanghai'' is crippled by a weak story and fatally undermined by clunky direction, making for a period political drama that lacks all of its key components."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shanghai/ |title=Shanghai (2015) |work=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=October 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film holds a score of 36 out of 100, sampled from 14 critics, signifying "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/shanghai |title=Shanghai |work=Metacritic |accessdate=October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Software visualization'''&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Bohnet, Jürgen Döllner: ''Analyzing Feature Implementation by Visual Exploration of Architecturally-Embedded Call-Graphs''. 4th International Workshop on Dynamic Analysis, ACM, ACM Press, pp. 41–48, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, 2002; Diehl, 2007; Knight, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; or '''software visualisation''' refers to the visualization of information of and related to software systems—either the [[software architecture|architecture]] of its [[source code]] or metrics of their [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|runtime behavior]]- and their development process by means of static, interactive or animated 2-D or 3-D&lt;ref&gt;(Marcus et al., 2003; Wettel et al., 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; visual representations of their structure,&lt;ref&gt;(Staples &amp; Bieman, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; execution,&lt;ref&gt;J. Trümper et al.: ''Multiscale Visual Comparison of Execution Traces''. Proceedings of the International Conference on Program Comprehension, IEEE Computer Society, pp. 53-62, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; behavior,&lt;ref&gt;(Kuhn et al., 2006, Stasko et al., 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and evolution.

== Software system information ==
Software visualization uses a variety of information available about software systems. Key information categories include: 
* [[implementation]] artifacts such as [[source code]]s, 
* [[software metric]] data from measurements or from [[reverse engineering]], 
* [[tracing (software)|traces]] that record execution behavior, 
* [[software testing]] data (e.g., test coverage)
* [[software repository]] data that tracks changes.

== Objectives ==
The objectives of software visualization are to support the [[program comprehension|understanding of software systems]] (i.e., its structure) and algorithms (e.g., by animating the behavior of sorting algorithms) as well as the analysis and exploration of software systems and their anomalies (e.g., by showing classes with high [[coupling (computer science)|coupling]]) and their development and evolution. One of the strengths of software visualization is to combine and relate information of software systems that are not inherently linked, for example by projecting code changes onto software execution traces.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bohnet et al.: ''Projecting Code Changes onto Execution Traces to Support Localization of Recently Introduced Bugs''. 24th ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, ACM, pp. 438–442, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Software visualization can be used as tool and technique to explore and analyze software system information, e.g., to discover anomalies similar to the process of [[Data mining|visual data mining]].&lt;ref&gt;(Keim, 2002; Soukup, 2002; Burch, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, software visualization is used to monitoring activities such as for code quality or team activity.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bohnet, J. Döllner: ''Monitoring Code Quality and Development Activity by Software Maps''. Proceedings of the IEEE ACM ICSE Workshop on Managing Technical Debt, pp. 9-16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Visualization is inherently not a method for [[software quality assurance]]{{fact|date=September 2017}}. Software visualization participates to [[Software intelligence|Software Intelligence]] in allowing to discover and take advantage of mastering inner components of software systems.

==Types==
Tools for software visualization might be used to visualize source code and [[software bug|quality defect]]s during software development and maintenance activities. There are different approaches to map source code to a visual representation such as by [[software map]]s&lt;ref&gt;D. Limberger et al.: ''Interactive Software Maps for Web-Based Source Code Analysis''. Proceedings of the International Web3D Conference, ACM, pp. 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Their objective includes, for example, the automatic discovery and visualization of quality defects in object-oriented software systems and services. Commonly, they visualize the direct relationship of a class and its methods with other classes in the software system and mark potential quality defects. A further benefit is the support for visual navigation through the software system.

More or less specialized [[graph drawing software]] is used for software visualization. A small-scale 2003 survey of researchers active in the [[reverse engineering]] and [[software maintenance]] fields found that a wide variety of visualization tools were used, including general purpose graph drawing packages like [[GraphViz]] and [[GraphEd]], UML tools like [[Rational Rose]] and [[Borland Together]], and more specialized tools like [[Visualization of Compiler Graphs]] (VCG) and [[Rigi (software)|Rigi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/smr.270 | title=Software visualization in software maintenance, reverse engineering, and re-engineering: a research survey | journal=Journal of Software Maintenance and Evolution: Research and Practice | date=2003 | volume=15 | issue=2 | pages=87–109 | first=Rainer | last=Koschke}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|99–100}} The range of UML tools that can act as a visualizer by reverse engineering source is by no means short; a 2007 book noted that besides the two aforementioned tools, [[ESS-Model]], [[BlueJ]], and [[Fujaba]] also have this capability, and that Fujaba can also identify [[design pattern]]s.&lt;ref name="Diehl2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephan Diehl|title=Software Visualization: Visualizing the Structure, Behaviour, and Evolution of Software|year=May 2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-46505-8|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tahitian Women on the Beach''''' ({{Lang-fr|Femmes de Tahiti}}) is an 1891 painting by [[Paul Gauguin]]. The painting depicts two women on the Pacific island of [[Tahiti]] on the beach.

The painting is currently in the collection of the [[Musée d'Orsay]], located in Paris, France.

In 1892 Gauguin painted a similar painting ''Parau api'', (''Two Women of Tahiti'') which is in the collection of the [[Galerie Neue Meister]] in Dresden. In Tahitian, "parau" means word and "api" means new. Thus "parau api" means news. A common greeting is "Eaha te parau api", or what's new?

'''''Transcendence''''' is an outdoor sculpture by [[Keith Jellum]], located in [[Portland, Oregon]], United States. It depicts a fish flying through the brickwork above Southpark Seafood at the northwestern corner of Southwest Salmon Street and Southwest Park Avenue in [[Downtown Portland]].&lt;ref name=May&gt;{{cite news|last=May|first=Joseph|title="Transcendence", a fish flying through a building — a sculpture by Keith Jellum|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/travelforaircraft/2011/10/30/“transcendence”-a-fish-flying-through-a-building-—-a-sculpture-by-keith-jellum/|accessdate=April 13, 2015|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=October 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Jennifer|title=Stumptown Stumper|url=http://portlandtribune.com/component/content/article?id=92227|accessdate=April 13, 2015|work=[[Portland Tribune]]|date=September 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture measures {{Convert|11|ft|m}} long and is made of hand forged and welded bronze. ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' said of the sculpture and its relation to the city: "There is much in the way of art there and one cannot get a bad coffee, beer or glass of wine there. People there are friendly and not above being whimsical, perhaps this is why Keith Jellum's installation found a home in Portland?"&lt;ref name=May/&gt;

'''Transgressive art''' is art that aims to transgress; i.e. to outrage or violate basic morals and sensibilities. The term ''transgressive'' was first used in this sense by American filmmaker [[Nick Zedd]] and his [[Cinema of Transgression]] in 1985.{{Clarify|date=June 2014}} Zedd used it to describe his legacy with underground film-makers like [[Paul Morrissey]], [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], and [[Kenneth Anger]], and the relationship they shared with Zedd and his New York City peers in the early 1980s.

==Definition==
From an academic perspective, many traces of transgression can be found in any art which by some is considered [[wikt:offensive|offensive]] because of its [[shock value]]; from the French [[Salon des Refusés]] artists to [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]]. Philosophers [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] and [[Georges Bataille]] have published works on the nature of transgression. Probably the most thorough book on the early transgressive movement is ''Deathtripping: The Cinema of Transgression'' by [[Jack Sargeant (writer)|Jack Sargeant]].

Transgressional works share some themes with art that deals with [[psychology|psychological]] dislocation and [[mental illness]]. Examples of this relationship, between social transgression and the exploration of mental states relating to illness, include many of the activities and works of the [[Dadaists]], [[Surrealists]], and [[Fluxus]]-related artists, such as [[Carolee Schneemann]] – and, in literature, [[Albert Camus]]'s ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|L'Etranger]]'' or [[J.D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]''.

The movement itself wishes to wear thin the border between the profane and the sacrosanct, and to test mores and values through subjecting glory to the inverse of cultural norms. Transgressive art often reflects an undercurrent of violence within the time it is produced.

===Changes in movement===
Since the late 1990s a new group of transgressive artists have emerged, such as the Canadian artist [[Rick Gibson]] who made a pair of earrings out of human fetuses and ate a piece of human testicle. In China several artists became well known for producing transgressive art; including [[Zhu Yu (artist)|Zhu Yu]], who achieved notoriety when he published images of himself eating what appeared to be a human [[fetus]]; and [[Yang Zhichao]] for extreme [[body art]].

==Artists==
Perhaps the most famous transgressive artist of the early 1980s, [[Richard Kern]] began making films in New York with infamous underground actors [[Nick Zedd]] and [[Lung Leg]]. Some of them were videos for musical artists including those for the [[Butthole Surfers]] and [[Sonic Youth]].

Subsequent transgressive artists of the 1990s overlapped the boundaries of literature, art, and music, most famously [[GG Allin]], [[Lisa Crystal Carver]], [[Shane Bugbee]], and [[Jean-Louis Costes|Costes]]. With these artists came a greater emphasis on life itself (or death) as art, rather than just depicting a certain mindset in film or music. They were instrumental in creating a new type of visionary art and music, and influenced artists including [[Alec Empire]], [[Cock E.S.P.]], [[Crash Worship]], [[Usama Alshaibi]], Natural Athlete, [[Liz Armstrong]], [[Lennie Lee]], [[Weasel Walter]], Andy Ortmann, and the later work featured in [[Peter Bagge]]'s comic [[Hate (comics)|''Hate'']].

Newer transgressive artists of the 2010s such as Nickk Dropkick, [[Joan Cornellà]], Aleksandra Waliszewska, and Molg H seem to have brought about a revival of transgressive art in recent years, with some small measure of popularity.

However, the term can also be applied to [[transgressional fiction|transgressive literature]] as well. Recent examples include  ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'' by [[Irvine Welsh]], ''[[Blood and Guts in High School]]'' by [[Kathy Acker]], ''[[American Psycho]]'' by [[Bret Easton Ellis]], ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'' by [[Chuck Palahniuk]],  and [[J.G. Ballard]]'s short story "The Enormous Space". These works deal with issues that were considered to be outside the social norms. Their characters abuse drugs, engage in violent behaviour or could be considered sexual deviants.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Trangressive writing can also be reflected in non-fiction, such as the writing style of [[Jim Goad]].&lt;ref name="PXLife"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portlandtribune.com/features/story.php?story_id=12327 |title=Citizen Goad |author=Joseph Gallivan |date=30 Oct 2009 |work=Entertainment |publisher=Portland Life |accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most notorious works of transgressive art among the general public have been sculpture, collages, and installation art which offended Christian religious sensibilities.  These include [[Andres Serrano]]'s ''[[Piss Christ]]'', featuring a crucifix in a beaker of urine, and [[Chris Ofili]]'s ''[[The Holy Virgin Mary]]'', a multi-media painting which is partially made of elephant dung.

==In music==
[[Rock and roll]] music has inspired controversy for the entirety of its existence. As the music grew in popularity, some artists used controversy to make a statement or turn it to their advantage. For musical genres such as [[shock rock]], [[punk rock]], [[horrorcore]] and its parent genres [[hardcore hip hop]] and [[gangsta rap]]; [[grindcore]], [[black metal]] and [[death metal]], as well as various bands within the [[avant-garde rock]] genre, offending modern sensibilities was an integral part of their music. Musicians such as [[Alice Cooper]], [[Slayer]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[N.W.A]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]], [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]], [[GWAR]], [[GG Allin]], [[The Plasmatics]], [[Cannibal Corpse]], [[Tyler, The Creator]], [[Throbbing Gristle]], [[Marilyn Manson]], [[Die Antwoord]], [[Jean-Louis Costes|Costes]], [[The Mentors]], [[Anal Cunt]], [[The Sex Pistols]], [[The Meatmen]], [[Brotha Lynch Hung]] and the [[Dead Kennedys]] used anti-Christian, anti-establishment, satirical lyrics that were generally considered to be evil by those who did not understand them. Some bands used the controversy to increase their popularity. The idea was, if people complained about their music enough and truly hated them, then the band's name and knowledge of their existence would reach the ears of people who would appreciate their music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://christandpopculture.com/capc-mag-volume-2-issue-13-popular-music/transcendence-transgression-rock-roll-music-luxury/|title=Transcendence, Transgression, and Rock &amp; Roll: The Music of Luxury - Christ and Pop Culture|work=Christ and Pop Culture|access-date=2017-09-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Welfare State International''' was a [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British]] [[experimental theatre]] group formed in 1968 by John Fox&lt;ref name=dggjf/&gt; and Sue Gill&lt;ref name=dggsg/&gt;, Roger Coleman&lt;ref name=WSIArch/&gt; and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nuttall|first=Jeff|title=Performance Art Memoirs|volume=1|year=1979|publisher=John Calder|isbn=0714537888|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became "A collective of radical artists and thinkers who explored ideas of celebratory art and spectacle between 1968 and 2006."&lt;ref name=WSIArch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welfare-state.org/pages/aboutwsi.htm|title=Welfare State International - About WSI|work=welfare-state.org|accessdate = 26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The company's name was originally 'The Welfare State', based on the concept of offering art for all on the same basis as education and health.&lt;ref name=WSIArch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1970sproject.co.uk/events/papers/gillian-whiteley.pdf|title=‘New Age’ radicalism and the social imagination: Welfare State International in the Seventies  |work=1970sproject.co.uk|first=Gillian |last=Whiteley }}{{Deadlink | date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/12293/3/Whiteley-Final%20accepted%20paper.pdf |title=‘New Age’ radicalism and the social imagination: Welfare State International in the Seventies |first=Gillian |last=Whiteley |work=dspace.lboro.ac.uk |accessdate = 30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welfare State International was initially known for staging large-scale outdoor spectacular events. At this time (the late 1960s), forsaking theatres and galleries for the street was unusual.

In November 2001, Welfare State International was described by the [[The Guardian|Guardian]] Guide as "Britain's foremost arts and installations collective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welfare-state.org/pages/john.htm|title=Welfare State International - John Fox|work=welfare-state.org|accessdate = 26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welfare State International's 'The Raising of the Titanic' (Limehouse Basin, London, 1983) has been listed among "Productions that transformed theatre".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/apr/01/experimental-theatre-spill-festival|title=Guardian article (2009/apr/01) ''Experimental theatre to spill into the mainstream'' |work=theguardian.com |accessdate = 26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welfare State International ceased operating on April Fools' Day 2006 after a performance at [[Ulverston]].&lt;ref name=dggjf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadgoodguides.co.uk/?page_id=2250|title=Dead Good Guides page for John Fox |work=deadgoodguides.com|accessdate = 26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dggsg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadgoodguides.co.uk/?page_id=2254 |title=Dead Good Guides page for Sue Gill |work=deadgoodguides.com|accessdate = 26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3590">'''Xtractaurs''' is a line of toys by [[Mattel]]. Introduced in 2009, the brand is a fusion of regular [[Action Figures|action figures]] with an [[Online Game|online game]]. It involves taking a [[dinosaur]] (both well-known and lesser-known dinosaurs) and [[Extraction (chemistry)|extracting]] "[[DNA]]" samples from the dinosaur and analyzing it on your [[computer]], similar in a way to the book and film [[Jurassic Park (franchise)|Jurassic Park]]. If you own multiple dinosaurs and have extracted samples from all of them, you can create a genetically engineered hybrid on the computer to battle the "Megavores", ancient reawakened dinosaurs that share qualities with your dinosaur. Each dinosaur you purchase has a special ability, and combining them makes a fierce fighting animal (your first dinosaur, ''[[Tyrannosaurus Rex]]'', has the Chomp ability). This encourages the fusion of certain samples even more.

The www.xtractaurs.com site has been taken down, and no usable site has been implemented for the toy series. As a result, there is no use for the toy sets other than display.

==Sampling==
To play the game, you must first purchase the Starter Kit, containing a DNA extractor gun, a Tyrannosaurus Rex, and the Xtractaurs installation [[CD]]. You first must insert the CD into your computer to install the Xtractaurs software. Once installed, you can open the software, create an account (You must have [[Broadband]] [[Internet]] connection to play online), and can plug in your DNA extractor gun with a cable on the handle of the gun, which ends in a male [[USB]] plug. You are now ready for extraction. Your T-rex has a female [[TRS connector|TRS]] port, much like the one in an [[iPod]] or [[iPhone]], in its thigh (as all dinosaurs under the brand do on a part of their body), and is compatible with a male TRS plug on the barrel of the extractor gun. When you plug the two, a display will appear on your screen showing a [[DNA strand]]. This means that electronics in the dinosaur are sending signals through the gun, through the cable, and into your computer. When done, an online version of your dinosaur pops up onto your screen. From there, you can play online games with your dinosaur, and begin your Xtractaurs adventure.

==Dinosaur Species==
Tyrannosaurs – [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]]- Ultrabite, [[Daspletosaurus]]- Megastomp, [[Gorgosaurus]]- Terroar, [[Tarbosaurus]]- Lacerator, [[Nanotyrannus]]- Quickfire

Raptors – [[Velociraptor]]- Snaptor, [[Deinonychus]]- Strykem, [[Utahraptor]]- Riptile, [[Dromaeosaurus]]- Slashclaw

Stegosaurs – [[Stegosaurus]]- Whipslash, [[Dacentrurus]]- Thornback, [[Yingshanosaurus]]- Twinstrike, [[Tuojiangosaurus]]- Spineblade(this figure was never released)

Pterosaurs – [[Pteranodon]]- Wingstorm, [[Criorhynchus]]- Beakbash, [[Tapejara (pterosaur)|Tapejara]]- Dreadhead, [[Quetzalcoatlus]]- Wingsurge

Ceratopsids – [[Triceratops]]- Pindown, [[Styracosaurus]]- Battlespike, [[Pentaceratops]]- Trance, [[Einiosaurus]]- Armorus

==Trivia==
* Original plans showed that Mattel planned for an [[Ankylosaur]] clan and a [[Spinosaur]] clan, there was also a [[Tuojiangosaurus]] figure that was never released, but the animal was kept in the game as a dinosaur card and bonus DNA. There was going to be a Series 2, but it was never released to the public.

'''''Young Man with a Skull''''' is a c.1626 painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Frans Hals]], now in the [[National Gallery]], London. The painting was previously thought to be a depiction of [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Hamlet]] holding the skull of [[Yorick]], but is now considered to be a [[vanitas]], a reminder of the precarious nature of life and the inevitability of death.

==Painting ==
The painting shows a young man wearing a feathered red bonnet and swathed with a cloak across his chest, gesturing dramatically towards the viewer with his right hand while holding a skull in his left hand.  It was first documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1910, who described it as a life-size half-length portrait of [[Hamlet]].  De Groot also wrote that it was exhibited on loan in the [[Dublin National Gallery]] in 1895.  He noticed this painting's similarity to another painting by Hals, and he remarked that in this work the subject's right hand "formerly rested on a skull which has been painted out". 

The interpretation as a theatrical portrayal of Hamlet was called into question by [[W.R. Valentiner]] in 1923. In his 1989 catalog of the international Frans Hals exhibition, Slive claims it is a [[vanitas]] and compares it to several other examples of men portrayed with skulls. He rejects the identification as Hamlet, because Shakespeare's plays have not been recorded in the Northern Netherlands in the 1620s.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Commons:Frans Hals Exhibition catalog, 1989|''Frans Hals'']], by [[Seymour Slive]] as editor, with contributions by [[Pieter Biesboer]], Martin Bijl, Karin Groen and Ella Hendriks, Michael Hoyle, Frances S. Jowell, Koos Levy-van Halm and Liesbeth Abraham, Bianca M. Du Mortier, Irene van Thiel-Stroman, page 208, Prestel-Verlag, Munich &amp; Mercatorfonds, Antwerp, 1989, {{ISBN|3791310321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was bought by the [[National Gallery, London]] in 1980.  They write that: "The Netherlandish tradition of showing young boys holding skulls is well-established and can be traced back to engravings of the early 16th century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Young Man holding a Skull (Vanitas)|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/frans-hals-young-man-holding-a-skull-vanitas|website=[[National Gallery]]|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The National Gallery also notes the exotic costume of the subject, similar to that shown by the [[Caravaggisti]] (followers of [[Caravaggio]]) based in Utrecht.  Hals' depiction of the subject's costume, holding a skull with a draped cloak over the chest, is similar to at least four other known paintings:
