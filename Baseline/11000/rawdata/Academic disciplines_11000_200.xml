For years [[scientists]] have been [[Tracking (hunting)|tracking]] animals and the ways they [[Animal migration|migrate]].  One of the many goals of animal migration research has been to determine where the animals are going; however, researchers also want to know why they are going "there". Researchers not only look at the animals' migration but also what is between point a and point b to determine if a species is moving to new locations based on food density, a change in water temperature, and the animal's ability to adapt to these changes.

== Technologies for tracking ==
[[File:Monarch Butterfly Danaus plexippus Tagged Closeup 3008px.jpg|A [[monarch butterfly]] shortly after tagging at the [[Cape May Bird Observatory]]
[[Cape May Bird Observatory]] is one of the organizations that has a monarch identification tagging program. Plastic stickers are placed on the wing of the insect with identification information. Tracking information is used to study the migration patterns of monarchs, including how far and where they fly.|thumb]]
In the fall of 1803, American Naturalist [[John James Audubon]] wondered whether migrating birds returned to the same place each year. So he tied a string around the leg of a bird before it flew south. The following spring, Audubon saw the bird had indeed come back.

Scientists today still attach tags, such as metal bands, to track movement of animals. Metal bands require the re-capture of animals for the scientists to gather data; the data is thus limited to the animal's release and destination points.

Recent technologies have helped solve this problem. Some electronic tags give off repeating signals that are picked up by radio devices or [[satellite]]s while other electronic tags could include archival tags (or data loggers). Scientists can track the locations and movement of the tagged animals without recapturing them using this [[RFID]] technology or satellites. These electronic tags can provide a great deal of data.  Modern technologies are also smaller, minimizing the negative impact of the tag on the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kingdon|first1=Amorina|title=Are Scientific Tracking Tags Hurting Wild Animals?|url=https://www.hakaimagazine.com/news/are-scientific-tracking-tags-hurting-wild-animals/|accessdate=26 January 2018|work=[[Hakai magazine]]|date=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radio tracking ==
{{Further|Telemetry}}
[[File:Petrogale penicillata with radio tracking collar - journal.pone.0063017.g001A.png|thumb|The right one of these two [[Petrogale penicillata|brush-tailed rock-wallabies]] is wearing a radio tracking collar.]]
[[Tracking (hunting)|Tracking]] an animal by radio telemetry involves two devices. [[Telemetry]], in general, involves the use of a [[transmitter]] that is attached to an animal and sends out a signal in the form of [[radio waves]], just as a [[radio station]] does.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/t-d/programs/im/satellite_gps_telemetry/wildlifetrackingtelementry.htm|title=Technology and Development at the USDA Forest Service, Satellite/GPS Telemetry for Monitoring Lesser Prairie Chickens|website=www.fs.fed.us|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scientist might place the transmitter around an animal's [[ankle]], [[neck]], [[wing]],  [[carapace]], or [[dorsal fin]]. Alternatively, they may surgically implant it as internal radio transmitters  have the advantage of remaining intact and functioning longer than traditional attachments, being protected from environmental variables and wear.&lt;ref&gt;Original text (in public domain):"Internal radio transmitters have the advantage of remaining intact and functioning longer than traditional attachments. Implanted transmitters also are protected from extrinsic variables such as environmental elements and wear (Eagle et al. 1984)." (Lander et al. 2005) http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1191&amp;context=usdeptcommercepub (accessed 29 November 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; A [[VHF]] receiver picks up the signal, just like a home radio picks up a station's signal. The receiver is usually in a [[truck]], an [[All-terrain vehicle|ATV]], or an [[airplane]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To keep track of the signal, the scientist follows the animal using the receiver. This approach of using radio tracking can be used to track the animal manually but is also used when animals are equipped with other payloads. The receiver is used to home in on the animal to get the payload back.

Another form of radio tracking that can be utilized, especially in the case of small bird migration, is the use of [[geolocation|geolocators]] or "geologgers".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animalmigration.org/geolocation/index.htm|title=Animal Migration Research, Jeff Kelly Lab|website=www.animalmigration.org|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology utilizes a light sensor that tracks the [[Light level geolocator|light-level data]] during regular intervals in order to determine a location based on the length of the day and the time of solar noon.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;While there are benefits and challenges with using this method of tracking, it is one of the only practical means of tracking small birds over long distances during migration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stutchbury|first=Bridget J. M.|last2=Tarof|first2=Scott A.|last3=Done|first3=Tyler|last4=Gow|first4=Elizabeth|last5=Kramer|first5=Patrick M.|last6=Tautin|first6=John|last7=Fox|first7=James W.|last8=Afanasyev|first8=Vsevolod|date=2009-02-13|title=Tracking Long-Distance Songbird Migration by Using Geolocators|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5916/896|journal=Science|language=en|volume=323|issue=5916|pages=896–896|doi=10.1126/science.1166664|issn=0036-8075|pmid=19213909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Passive Integrated Transponder|Passive integrated transponders]] (PIT) are another method of telemetry used to track the movements of a species  &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Passive integrated transponders, or "PIT tags", are electronic tags that allow researchers to collect data from a specimen without the need to recapture and handle the  animal.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.psmfc.org/program/pit-tag-information-systems-ptagis|title=PIT Tag Information Systems (PTAGIS) {{!}} Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission|website=www.psmfc.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data is captured and monitored via electronic interrogation antennae, which records the time and location of the individual.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Pit tags are a humane method of tracking that has little risk of infection or mortality due to the limited contact necessary to monitor the specimens. They are also cost-efficient in that they can be used repeatedly should the need arise to remove the tag from the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/passive-integrated-transponder-pit-tags-in-the-101289287|title=Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) Tags in the Study of Animal Movement {{!}} Learn Science at Scitable|website=www.nature.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Satellite tracking ==
{{main|GPS wildlife tracking}}
[[File:Crocodylus porosus with GPS-based satellite transmitter attached to the nuchal rosette - journal.pone.0062127.g002.png|thumb|A [[saltwater crocodile]] with GPS-based satellite [[transmitter]] for migration tracking]]
Receivers can be placed in [[Earth]]-[[orbit]]ing satellites such as [[Argos System|ARGOS]]. Networks, or groups, of satellites are used to track animals. Each satellite in a network picks up electronic signals from a transmitter on an animal. Together, the signals from all satellites determine the precise [[Location (geography)|location]] of the animal. The satellites also track the animal's path as it moves. Satellite-received transmitters fitted to animals can also provide information about the animals' physiological characteristics (e.g. temperature) and habitat use.&lt;ref name=Gavashelishvili8&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gavashelishvili, A. |author2=McGrady, M. J. |year=2007 |title=Radio-satellite telemetry of a territorial Bearded Vulture ''Gypaetus barbatus'' in the Caucasus |journal=Vulture News |volume=56 |pages=4–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gavashelishvili19&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gavashelishvili, A. |author2=McGrady, M. |author3=Ghasabian, M. |author4=Bildstein, K.

Satellite networks have tracked the migration and territorial movements of [[caribou]], [[sea turtles]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seaturtle.org/&lt;/ref&gt; [[whales]], [[great white sharks]], [[pinniped|seals]], [[elephants]], [[bald eagles]], [[osprey]]s and [[vulture]]s.&lt;ref name="Gavashelishvili8"/&gt; Additionally [[Pop-up satellite archival tag]]s are used on marine mammals and various species of fish. There are two main systems, the above-mentioned Argos and the [[GPS]].&lt;ref name=baldibis&gt;[http://northernbaldibis.blogspot.com/2011/10/it-has-been-mentioned-in-previous-posts.html Northern Bald Ibis Project]&lt;/ref&gt;
Thanks to these systems, conservationists can find the key sites for migratory species.&lt;ref name=baldibis/&gt;  Another form of satellite tracking would be the use of [[Acoustic tag|acoustic telemetry]]. This involves the use of electronic tags that emit sound in order for the researchers to track and monitor an animal within three dimensions, which is helpful in instances when large quantities of a species are being tracked at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.htisonar.com/what_are_acoustic_tags.htm|title=Acoustic Telemetry Fisheries Research|website=www.htisonar.com|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stable Isotopes ==
[[File:Logger eggs 01.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Logger%20eggs%2001.jpg|thumb|Sea turtle eggs being laid my the mother. Unhatched eggs can be used in stable isotope analysis.]]
[[Stable isotope ratio|Stable isotopes]] are one of the intrinsic markers used for studying [[Animal migration|migration]] of animals.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/228300275|title=Tracking animal migration with stable isotopes|date=2008|publisher=Academic Press|others=Hobson, Keith Alan, 1954-, Wassenaar, Leonard I.|isbn=9780123738677|location=Amsterdam|oclc=228300275}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the benefits of intrinsic markers in general, including stable isotope analysis, is that it does not require an organism to be capture and tagged and then recaptured at a later time. Each capture of an organism provides information on where it has been based on diet. The three types of intrinsic markers that can be used as tools for animal migration studies are: (1) contaminants, [[Parasitism|parasites]] and [[Pathogen|pathogens]], (2) trace elements, and (3) stable isotopes. Certain geographic regions have specific stable isotope ratios that affect the chemistry of organisms [[foraging]] in those locations, this creates "isoscapes" that scientists can use to understand where the organism has been eating. A couple prerequisites must be met in order to use stable isotope analysis successfully: (1) the animal must have at least one light isotope of interest in specific tissues that can be sampled (this condition is almost always met since these light isotopes are building blocks of most animal tissues), and (2) the organism needs to migrate between isotopically different regions and these isotopes must be retained in the tissue in order for the differences to be measured. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Stable isotope analysis has a lot of benefits and has been used in terrestrial and aquatic organisms. For example, stable isotope analysis has been confirmed to work in determining [[foraging]] locations of nesting [[Loggerhead sea turtle|loggerhead sea turtles]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ceriani|first=Simona A.|last2=Roth|first2=James D.|last3=Evans|first3=Daniel R.|last4=Weishampel|first4=John F.|last5=Ehrhart|first5=Llewellyn M.|date=2012-09-20|title=Inferring Foraging Areas of Nesting Loggerhead Turtles Using Satellite Telemetry and Stable Isotopes|url=https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0045335|journal=PLoS ONE|language=en|volume=7|issue=9|pages=e45335|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0045335|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3447946|pmid=23028943}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Satellite telemetry was used to confirm that the location derived from the analysis were accurate to where these turtles actually traveled. This is important because it allows for greater sample sizes to be used in migration studies, since satellite telemetry is expensive and [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], [[Blood|blood,]] and [[egg]] samples can be taken from the female turtles laying eggs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Importance ==
[[File:TagHolder04.jpg|thumb|right|SeaTag-GEO on a turtle carrier platform for turtle tagging]]
Electronic tags are giving scientists a complete, accurate picture of migration [[patterns]]. For example, when scientists used radio transmitters to track one [[herd]] of [[caribou]], they learned two important things. First, they learned that the herd moves much more than previously thought. Second, they learned that each year the herd returns to about the same place to give [[birth]]. This information would have been difficult or impossible to obtain with "low tech" tags.

Tracking migrations is an important tool to better understand and protect [[species]]. For example, [[Florida]] [[manatees]] are an [[endangered species]], and therefore they need protection. Radio tracking showed that Florida manatees may travel as far as Rhode Island when they migrate. This information suggests that the manatees may need protection along much of the Atlantic Coast of the United States. Previously, protection efforts focused mainly in the Florida area.

In the wake of the [[BP oil spill]], efforts in tracking animals has increased in the Gulf. Most researchers who use electronic tags have only a few options: pop-up satellite tags, archival tags, or satellite tags. Historically these tags were generally expensive and could cost several thousands of dollars per tag. However, with current advancements in technology prices are now allowing researchers to tag more animals. With this increase in the number of species and individuals that can be tagged it is important to record and acknowledge the potential negative effects these devices might have. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Bell, S.

The '''Bolshoi-Planck simulation''', with the same resolution as Bolshoi, was run in 2013 on the Pleiades supercomputer using the [[Planck satellite]] team's cosmological parameters released in March 2013. The Bolshoi-Planck simulation is currently being analyzed in preparation for publication and distribution of its results in 2014.&lt;ref name="Bolshoi-Planck"&gt;{{cite web|last=Primack|first=Joel|title=Computing the Universe|url=http://p25ext.lanl.gov/colloquium_files/primack_abstract.html|publisher=[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]|accessdate=1 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Primack|first=Joel|title=Bolshoi-Planck Cosmological Simulation.

Bolshoi simulations continue to be developed as of 2018.

== Contributors ==

[[Joel R. Primack|Joel R. Primack’s]] team at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], partnered with Anatoly Klypin’s group at [[New Mexico State University]], in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]]&lt;ref name="ApJ740-102"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ApJ742-16"/&gt; to run and analyze the Bolshoi simulations. Further analysis and comparison with observations by Risa Wechsler’s group at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and others are reflected in the papers based on the Bolshoi simulations.&lt;ref name=BolshoiPublications&gt;{{cite web|last=High-Performance AstroComputing Center|first=University of California|title=Publications|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/Bolshoi/Papers.html|work=Bolshoi Cosmic Simulation|publisher=UC-HiPACC|accessdate=3 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rationale ==

A successful large-scale simulation of the evolution of [[galaxies]], with results consistent with what is actually seen by astronomers in the night sky, provides evidence that the theoretical underpinnings of the models employed, i.e., the supercomputer implementations ΛCDM, are sound bases for understanding galactic dynamics and the history of the universe, and opens avenues to further research. The Bolshoi Simulation isn't the first large-scale simulation of the universe, but it’s the first to rival the extraordinary precision of modern astrophysical observations.&lt;ref name=IEEESpectrum/&gt;

The previous largest and most successful simulation of galactic evolution was the [[Millennium run|Millennium Simulation Project]], led by Volker Springel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boylan-Kolchin|first=Michael|author2=Volker Springel|author3=Simon D. M. White|author4=Adrian Jenkins|author5=Gerard Lemson|title=Resolving cosmic structure formation with the Millennium-II Simulation|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|date=5 Jun 2009|volume=398|issue=3|pages=1150–1164|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15191.x|arxiv=0903.3041|url=http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/398/3/1150|accessdate=11 Jan 2014|bibcode = 2009MNRAS.398.1150B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the success of that project stimulated more than 400 research papers, the Millennium simulations used early WMAP cosmological parameters that have since become obsolete. As a result, they led to some predictions, for example about the distribution of galaxies, that don’t match very well with observations. The Bolshoi simulations use the latest cosmological parameters, are higher in resolution, and have been analyzed in greater detail.&lt;ref name=BolshoiPublications/&gt;

== Methods ==

The Bolshoi simulation follows the evolving distribution of a statistical ensemble of 8.6 billion particles of [[dark matter]], each of which represents about 200 million [[solar mass]]es, in a cube of 3-dimensional space about 1 billion light years on edge. Dark matter and [[dark energy]] dominate the evolution of the cosmos in this model. The dynamics are modeled with the ΛCDM theory and [[Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]], with the model including [[cold dark matter]] (CDM) and the Λ [[cosmological constant]] term simulating the [[cosmic acceleration]] referred to as dark energy.

The first 100 million years ([[Myr]]) or so of the [[Chronology of the universe|evolution of the universe]] after the [[Big Bang]] can be derived analytically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |year=2010 |title=How Did the First Stars and Galaxies Form? |series=Princeton Frontiers in Physics |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9373.html |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=9781400834068 |accessdate=3 Jan 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bolshoi simulation was started at [[redshift]] z=80, corresponding to about 20 Myr after the Big Bang.  Initial parameters were calculated with linear theory as implemented by the CAMB&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lewis|first1=Antony |last2=Challinor |first2=Anthony |title=Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background|url=http://camb.info/|publisher=Antony Lewis|accessdate=3 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  tools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CAMB Web Interface|url=http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/toolbox/tb_camb_form.cfm|work=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|publisher=Goddard Space Flight Center|accessdate=3 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; part of the WMAP website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|first=Goddard Space Flight Center|title=Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|url=http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/current/|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=3 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tools provide the initial conditions, including a statistical distribution of positions and velocities of the particles in the ensemble, for the much more demanding Bolshoi simulation of the next approximately 13.8 billion years. The experimental volume thus represents a random region of the universe, so comparisons with observations must be statistical.
[[File:Key Cosmological Parameters σ8 and ΩM from Observations Compared with Simulations.jpg|thumb|350px|right|alt=Key Cosmological Parameters σ8 and ΩM from Observations Compared with Simulations|Two key cosmological parameters, σ8 and ΩM, with values and 1-σ uncertainties from observations and values used in three cosmological simulations. The parameter σ8 represents the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum on the scale of clusters of galaxies, and the parameter ΩM is the dark + ordinary matter fraction of the cosmic density. The observations represented by the shapes on the figure are from X-ray and gravitational lensing studies of clusters of galaxies. The observations with error bars are from cosmic microwave background data combined with other data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) five-year (2009), seven-year (2011), and nine-year (2013) publications and the Planck (2013) data release. The simulations are the Millennium I, II, and XXL simulations (which all used the same cosmological parameters consistent with the WMAP first-year data release 2003), and the Bolshoi (2011) and Bolshoi-Planck (2014) simulations.]]
The Bolshoi simulation employs a version of an [[adaptive mesh refinement]] (AMR) algorithm called an adaptive refinement tree (ART), in which a cube in space with more than a predefined density of matter is recursively divided into a mesh of smaller cubes. The subdivision continues to a limiting level, chosen to avoid using too much supercomputer time.  Neighboring cubes are not permitted to vary by too many levels, in the case of Bolshoi by more than one level of subdivision, to avoid large discontinuities. The AMR/ART method is well suited to model the increasingly inhomogeneous distribution of matter that evolves as the simulation proceeds. “Once constructed, the mesh, rather than being destroyed at each time step, is promptly adjusted to the evolving particle distribution.”&lt;ref name="ApJS111-73"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/319000/files/9701195.pdf|format=PDF|title=Adaptive Refinement Tree − A New High-Resolution N-Body Code for Cosmological Simulations |first1=Andrey V.|last1=Kravtsov|first2=Anatoly A.|last2=Klypin|first3=Alexei M.|last3= Khokhlov|publisher=Astrophys.J.Supplement 111, 73, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the Bolshoi simulation ran, the position and velocity of each of the 8.6 billion particles representing dark matter was recorded in 180 snapshots roughly evenly spaced over the simulated 13.8-billion-year run on the Pleiades supercomputer.&lt;ref name="ApJ740-102"/&gt; Each snapshot was then analyzed to find all the dark matter halos and the properties of each (particle membership, location, density distribution, rotation, shape, etc.).  All this data was then used to determine the entire growth and merging history of every halo.  These results are used in turn to predict where galaxies will form and how they will evolve.  How well these predictions correspond to observations provides a measure of the success of the simulation. Other checks were also made.&lt;ref name="ApJ742-16"/&gt;

== Results ==

The Bolshoi simulation is considered to have produced the best approximation to reality so far obtained for so large a volume of space, about 1 billion light years across. 
“Bolshoi produces a model universe that bears a striking and uncanny resemblance to the real thing. Starting with initial conditions based on the known distribution of matter shortly after the Big Bang, and using Einstein’s general theory of relativity as the ‘rules’ of the simulation, Bolshoi predicts a modern-day universe with galaxies lining up into hundred-million-light-year-long filaments that surround immense voids, forming a cosmic foam-like structure that precisely matches the [[cosmic web]] as revealed by deep galaxy studies such as the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]]. To achieve such a close match, Bolshoi is clearly giving cosmologists a fairly accurate picture of how the universe actually evolved.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/skytel/beyondthepage/Interview-with-Joel-Primack-152323655.html|title=Introduction to Interview with Joel Primack|publisher=Sky and Telescope|date=19 Mar 2012|accessdate=1 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support ==

This research was supported by grants from NASA and [[National Science Foundation|NSF]] to Joel Primack and Anatoly Klypin, including massive grants of supercomputer time on the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) supercomputer Pleiades at NASA Ames Research Center. Hosting of the Bolshoi outputs and analyses at [[Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam]] (AIP) is partially supported by the [[MultiDark]] grant from the Spanish MICINN Programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What was the support for the Bolshoi simulation suite?|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/Bolshoi/FAQ.html#Q12|work=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=UC-HiPACC|accessdate=12 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the creation and criticism of fictional works, a '''character flaw''' is a limitation, imperfection, problem, [[phobia]], or deficiency present in a character who may be otherwise very functional. The flaw can be a problem that directly affects the character's actions and abilities, such as a violent temper. Alternatively, it can be a simple foible or personality defect, which affects the character's motives and social interactions, but little else.

Flaws can add depth and humanity to the characters in a [[narrative]].  For example, the sheriff with a gambling addiction, the [[action hero]] who is afraid of heights, or a lead in a [[romantic comedy]] who must overcome his insecurity regarding male pattern baldness are all characters whose flaws help provide dimension.  Perhaps the most widely cited and classic of character flaws is [[Achilles]]' famous heel.

In general, flaws can be categorized as ''minor'', ''major'', or ''tragic''.

==Minor flaw==
A minor character flaw is an imperfection which serves to distinguish the character in the mind of the reader / viewer / player / listener, making them memorable and individual, but otherwise does not affect the story in any way.

Examples of this could include a noticeable scar, a thick accent or a habit such as cracking their knuckles.

[[Protagonists]] and other major characters may (and usually do) have multiple minor flaws, making them more accessible, and enabling the reader / viewer / listener to relate to the character (in the case of a [[sympathetic character]]) or otherwise influence the audience's opinions of the character.

Many insignificant or archetypal characters which are encountered only once or rarely are defined solely by a single minor flaw, differentiating them from the [[stock character]] or [[archetype]] that they adhere to.

==Major flaw==
A major character flaw is a much more noticeable and important hindrance which actually impairs the individual, whether physically, mentally or morally. Sometimes major flaws are not actually negative per se (such as devout religious beliefs or a rigid code of honor), but are classified as such in that they often serve to hinder or restrict the character in some way.

Examples of this type of flaw could include blindness, [[amnesia]] or greed.

Unlike minor flaws, major flaws are almost invariably important to either the character's, or the story's development.

*For villains, their major flaw is usually the cause of their eventual downfall.
*For heroes, their major flaw usually must be overcome (either temporarily or permanently) at some point in the story, often at the climax, by their own determination or skill.
*For neutral characters, or those that shift allegiance, the major flaw is usually the cause of either their corruption, redemption or both.
*For the protagonist, the most visible flaw generally serves a more vital interest, as well, as it defines his or her core problem.  It is the protagonist's reluctant (and usually unconscious) journey to address this problem that forms the spine of the story, sometimes acting as the [[MacGuffin]] to stimulate the plot.

==Tragic/fatal flaw==
This is a specific sort of flaw, also known as "[[Hamartia]]", which is possessed by Aristotelian [[tragic hero]]s. It is a flaw which causes an otherwise noble or exceptional character to bring about their own downfall and, often, their eventual death.

Examples of this could include [[hubris]], misplaced trust, excessive curiosity, pride and lack of self-control.

This fall usually occurs at the beginning of a story, with the story itself concentrates on the consequences or attempted redemption of the fall.

== Examples ==

===Literature===
*[[Oedipus|Oedipus's]] downfall is directly linked to arrogance: ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''
*Macbeth suffers from [[hubris]], leading to the murder of [[Duncan I of Scotland]]; he later becomes [[paranoia|paranoid]], leading him to order the deaths of [[Banquo]] and the family of [[Macduff (Macbeth)|Macduff]]: ''[[Macbeth]]''
*[[Hamlet]] is indecisive and self-doubting, which thwarts him in avenging his father's murder.
*[[Victor Frankenstein]] suffers from excessive curiosity and irresponsibility, leading to the creation of the [[Frankenstein's monster|monster]] that destroys his life: ''[[Frankenstein]]''
*[[Sigurd]] has a vulnerable spot on his back, where a linden leaf fell as he was bathing in dragon's blood: ''[[Volsunga saga]]'' 
*[[Agamemnon]] acts in greed when he takes [[Briseis]] away from [[Achilles]], losing the warrior's support in the [[Trojan War]]: ''[[The Iliad]]''. Achilles's own flaw was his own arrogance.
*[[Odysseus|Odysseus's]] flaw was an extreme [[Hubris (Ancient Greece)|hubris]] which led him to dishonor the god [[Poseidon]]. (''[[The Odyssey]]'')
*[[Cyrano De Bergerac]], despite his many accomplishments, suffers from self-doubt because of his huge nose which keeps him from pursuing the woman he loves.
*[[Marvin the Paranoid Android]] suffers from extreme depression, as well as extreme boredom due to his huge yet mostly inactive mind: ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''
*[[Tom Riddle|Tom Riddle's]] extreme [[thanatophobia]] eventually transformed him into the vile Lord Voldemort in his pursuit for [[immortality]]. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Harry Potter]]'s worst flaws, as stated by Rowling, are "anger and occasional arrogance." However, within the text, it is implied his flaw might be his heroic desire to save people. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Percy Jackson]] has a fatal flaw of excessive personal loyalty, while his girlfriend Annabeth Chase shares the flaw of the legendary Odysseus: hubris. (''[[Percy Jackson and the Olympians]]'')
*[[Jo March]]'s bluntness and hot temper cause conflict with her family. ''[[Little Women]]''
*In the ''[[Star Wars Expanded Universe|Star Wars Legends]]'' continuity, [[Jacen Solo|Jacen Solo's]] eventual downfall is linked to his placing the weight of the galaxy on his shoulder in his desire for peace.

===Film===
*In ''[[Rocky]]'', [[Rocky Balboa]] thinks of himself as a loser who cannot go the distance in the boxing ring.
*[[Anakin Skywalker]]'s anger and fear of losing his wife [[Padme Amidala|Padme]] eventually consumes him, leading to his transformation into [[Darth Vader]]. Whereas his mentor [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi's]] compassion and love for his student blinded him to the path Skywalker was taking. (''[[Star Wars]]'')
*In ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', Rick thinks of himself as an unfeeling cynic who denies the pain and disappointment from a failed love affair with Ilsa.
*In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', the detective played by [[James Stewart]] is afraid of heights and has to climb a tower.
*[[Captain Hook]] is obsessed with ''[[Peter Pan]]''
*[[Characters in Blade Runner#Roy Batty|Roy Batty]], as a replicant, is powerful, but has a very short lifespan: ''[[Blade Runner]]''
*[[Oskar Schindler]] in the film ''[[Schindler's List]]'' must overcome his greedy nature and find compassion to sacrifice in order to save his workers

===Television===
*[[B. A. Baracus]] is afraid of flying: ''[[The A-Team]]''
*[[Homer Simpson]] is an alcoholic, not too bright and prone to reckless choices: ''[[The Simpsons]]''
*[[Philip J. Fry]] (usually) has a severe lack of intelligence: ''[[Futurama]]''
*[[Londo Mollari]] yearns to return to the "glory days" of the [[Centauri Republic]]: ''[[Babylon 5]]''
*[[Mr. Spock]] relies heavily on logic and suppresses his more human emotions: ''[[Star Trek]]''
*[[Drake Mallard|Darkwing Duck/Drake Mallard]] has a big ego. ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''
*[[Peter Griffin]] is extremely impulsive and causes many problems for his family and friends: ''[[Family Guy]]''
*[[Zuko]] makes misguided decisions in an effort to gain his cruel father's acceptance: ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''
*[[Aang]] is too carefree and initially attempts to run from his responsibilities rather than face them: ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''
*[[Dean Winchester]] relies on family and is devastated when he loses them or they betray his trust: ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]''
*[[The Tenth Doctor]] is constantly trying to help and save the lives of others, and sometimes does things out of anger that have dire consequences later: ''[[Doctor Who]]''
*[[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin's]] greatest character flaw was his greed, losing even those who love him over his mad desire for power. He shares this flaw with his former student and lover [[Cora Mills|Cora]]. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'') 
*[[Zelena (Once Upon a Time)|Zelena's]] envy of her younger half-sister [[Regina Mills]] eventually transformed her into the infamous [[Wicked Witch of the West]] as she planned to reverse time and supplant Regina. Even after this plan was thwarted, her envy remained a great character flaw throughout her time on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*After the death of her fiance Daniel Colter, [[Regina Mills|Regina]] suffered a mental breakdown and became consumed with anger, which Rumplestiltskin was able to use to shape her into the Evil Queen who would cast his Dark Curse. Anger, as a fatal flaw, is one she shares with [[Hook (Once Upon a Time)|Killian Jones]] whose own anger transformed him into vengeful [[Captain Hook]]; however, Hook did not share Regina's mental instability. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*The main character flaw of the protagonist of the series, [[Emma Swan]], are her tendency to mistrust other people, which leads her to put up emotional barriers to protect herself and run when things get difficult. Her overcoming this flaw is a major story arc on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')

===Gaming===
* In [[Warhammer 40,000]], the Primarch Lorgar Aurelian is extremely devout and reveres his "father", the Emperor of Mankind, as a god. The Emperor envisages a human civilization free of the shackles of religion and dogma and chastises Lorgar and his legion for worshipping him. Hurt and depressed by the humiliation of his father's rebuke, Lorgar and the [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]] of the XVII Legion (the "Word Bearers") search for another purpose to sustain them, and in doing so become the first legion to fall under the malicious influence of [[Chaos (Warhammer)|Chaos]]. Their devotion to Chaos sees them instigate the devastating civil war known as the [[Horus Heresy (fictional event)|Horus Heresy]], the events of which led to the current dystopian setting of Warhammer 40,000.
*In ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', Liquid's jealousy of Solid Snake's "dominant genes" and his desire to be the better of the two sets much of the story in motion, leading to Liquid's eventual downfall.
*In the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series, [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] acts brutally and violently out of anger and desire for revenge, with devastating consequences on his only life and the world around him.

'''China University of Political Science and Law''' ('''CUPL'''; [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified Chinese]]: 中国政法大学; [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional Chinese]]: 中國政法大學; [[pinyin]]: ''Zhōngguó Zhèngfǎ Dàxué'' abbr. 法大, ''Fǎ Dà'') is a national public research university specialized in [[law]], [[The arts|arts]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[economics]], [[management]] and [[foreign language]]s established in 1952 in [[Beijing]], [[China]].

China University of Political Science and Law is a first tier institution within the national key university [[Project 211]] and the [[985 Innovative Platforms for Key Disciplines Project|Project 985 Innovative Platforms for Key Disciplines]] as part of the national endeavor to build world-class universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cupl.edu.cn/xxgk/xxjj.htm|title=学校简介-中国政法大学|website=www.cupl.edu.cn|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; CUPL is a Chinese Ministry of Education [[Double First Class University Plan|Double First Class Discipline University]] with the highest status "A+" in legal studies.&lt;ref name="Chinese Department of Education"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A22/moe_843/201709/t20170921_314942.html|title=教育部 财政部 国家发展改革委 关于公布世界一流大学和一流学科建设高校及建设 学科名单的通知 (Notice from the Ministry of Education and other national governmental departments announcing the list of double first class universities and disciplines)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely considered to be one of the best Chinese universities in legal studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zyxw.cn/article/cdetail/3736|title=2016教育部法学院排名名单|last=|first=|date=|website=www.zyxw.cn|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of the most competitive and selective universities to enter in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gaokao.com/e/20130618/51c0051a1d4fd.shtml|title=2013年中国大学高考招生50强|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gaokao.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CUPL has two campuses, one in [[Haidian District|Haidian]], [[Beijing]] which is the original campus of the university, and the other locates in [[Changping District|Changping]], [[Beijing]]. The university's Haidian campus now hosts [[postgraduate]] students only while [[undergraduate]]s study at a much larger campus in [[Changping District|Changping]], [[Beijing]]. In 2015, CUPL comprises 13 schools, with 15,833 students and 951 faculty members, of whom 290 are professors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cupl.edu.cn/szdw.htm|title=师资队伍-中国政法大学|website=www.cupl.edu.cn|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; CUPL maintains a broad international exchange program, with approximately 1000 foreign students from many countries.

==History==
CUPL was initially established in 1952, with its official name '''Peking College of Political Science and Law''' and combined departments of law, political science, sociology and other subjects of [[Peking University]], [[Yenching University]], [[Fu Jen Catholic University]] and [[Tsinghua University]]. The prestigious scholar [[Ch'ien Tuan-Sheng]] (钱端升), who was educated at [[Harvard University]] and regarded as the founder of modern [[political science]] in China, was appointed as the first president. But after the outbreak of [[Cultural Revolution]] CUPL was greatly affected. CUPL had been stopped during Cultural Revolution. Ch'ien died of illness in 1990.

In 1983, under the policy of [[Central People's Government]] to develop the college quickly and make it the center of politics and law education in China, BCPSL was renamed as the China University of Political Science and Law. The Changping campus was a part of the State's [[Economic history of China|Seventh Five-Year-Plan]] in 1985.

Under the [[motto]] of "Cherish the Moral, Understand the Law, Know the World, Serve the Public"; CUPL made its contribution to the development of legal education and training in China. It was the first university to establish specialties such as Legal History, Civil and Commercial Law, Economic Law, Procedure Law and Comparative Law in the PRC. It also contributed to the education and promotion of [[Roman law]] in China. With over 100,000 graduates in the past 50 years who have become the elites of law enforcement and practitioners in China, CUPL has developed a niche for the enactment and enforcement of law in China. Furthermore, it became prominent in other public affairs in China, among which members of the faculty and student body played an active role in the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] demanding [[democracy]] and [[rule of law]].

To face the challenge of globalization, CUPL developed joint programs with international partners. CUPL provided the first opportunity to study Chinese law in Beijing with an [[American Bar Association]]-approved program inaugurated in 1995 by the [[Duquesne University School of Law]]. In 2008, an exchange program was formed with [[Fordham University School of Law]].

CUPL also maintains relationship with the [[University of Exeter]] and the [[University of Oxford]] in [[England]], [[Deakin University]] in [[Australia]], [[University of Pennsylvania|the University of Pennsylvania]], [[Georgetown University]], [[Washington University in St. Louis]], the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|UIUC]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[University of California, Davis]] in the [[United States]], the [[University of Montreal]] in [[Canada]], and [[National University of Singapore Faculty of Law]] in [[Singapore]].

==Postgraduate Programs==
CUPL also offers two LLM programs and a PhD program for international students in English. One of them is based in Changping and is with the China-EU University. This is an EU funded course, and its main focus is on educating Chinese students on EU law.

There is another LLM program at Haidian campus, in downtown Beijing, which is aimed at International students to learn about Chinese law. There is also a PhD programs in English at Haidian campus. These are flexible and taught entirely in English. They include the option to study Mandarin, and gain law work experience in Beijing and other cities in China.

These postgraduate programs are also open as a semester program to international students from any institution around the world who would like to study at CUPL for one semester.

==Chinese Language Programs==
There are Chinese language programs for international students. These are 8,000 RMB per semester, or 16,000 RMB per year. Students can also stay in accommodation on campus which is 1,000 RMB per year.

The '''conservation and restoration of panel paintings''' involves working with an object that is composed of two media: wood and paint.  The process of [[conservation and restoration of paintings]] on canvas is different to that of [[panel paintings]]. In the U.S., it is recommended that conservation practices  follow the "Code of Ethics"  set by the [[American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice|url=http://www.conservation-us.org/our-organizations/association-(aic)/governance/code-of-ethics-and-guidelines-for-practice#.WNlADKK1vtQ|website=www.conservation-us.org|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Preventative care ==
Preventative care is a form of conserving panel paintings. Improper storage conditions, environmental conditions, and handling can act as catalysts in damaging effects. These include chemical and structural damage, seen through skin oils and degradation that can be caused by high humidity or high temperature levels.  The conservation of panel paintings can be achieved by a series of methods, including: 

=== Handling ===
The recommended handling method of panel paintings is similar to that of canvas paintings and other two-dimensional works. The procedure includes planning the move, handling with two hands or in tandem, communication within the handling staff during the move, the use of nitrile gloves, the use of painting carts and other tools including a pallet jack or furniture dolly when moving a panel painting within a crat. The [http://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/The_Care_and_Handling_of_Art_Objects_Practices_in_The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art# Metropolitan Museum of Art], the [http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1439925170562 Canadian Conservation Institute], and the [https://aiccm.org.au/sites/default/files/docs/reCollections/6_htsd.pdf Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material] provide general handbooks that discuss the proper handling and care of paintings. 
[[File:Storage room, Heritage Conservation Centre, Singapore - 20141125-04.jpg|thumb|Storage room, Heritage Conservation Centre, Singapore]]

=== Storage ===
Typical storage units in museums include sliding screens or slotted shelves made out of MDF and heat treated wood coated in polyurethane.  "S" Hooks are used to hang objects with the proper hanging hardware (e.g. D-Rings or eye brackets with picture wire) onto the screen. Temporary storage solutions include the use of ethafoam, moving/packing blankets, and [http://www.gaylord.com/Preservation/Conservation-Supplies/Boards-%26-Paper/Gaylord-Archival%26%23174%3B-48-x-96%22-E-flute-Corrugated-Board-%2815-Pack%29/p/EFCB4892 archival corrugated cardboard].

=== Environmental conditions ===
Fluctuating humidity and temperatures can lead to smaller problems within the structure and painted surface that in the long-term accumulate. In panels that are made up of multiple pieces of wood composing the larger surface area, the damage can be visible where the pieces of wood are attached&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Structural Conservationof Panel Paintings|last=J. Paul Getty Museum|first=|publisher=The J. Paul Getty Trust|year=1998|isbn=9780892363841|location=1998|pages=318-319}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Temperatures should range between +/- 5% of 70°F and the humidity between +/- 5% of 50% Relative Humidity. A Relative Humidity over 65% can lead to mold growth and dry rot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/caring-for-the-paintings/paintings-and-their-environment?viewPage=3|title=Paintings and their Environment|last=|first=|date=|website=The National Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In exhibitions panel paintings are subjected to various environmental conditions. The exhibition conditions must also be regulated to conserve the painting. These factor includes temperature, humidity , light intensity and duration of exposure, and air and atmospheric pollutants. There must be sufficient air filters attached to the HVAC system to reduce the air pollutants within the air in gallery/exhibition spaces along with storage areas (via reducing gases potentially emitted by various objects). Light levels must be at approximately 50-200 Lux as there is an irreversible light lifetime per panel painting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/environmental-display-guidelines-paintings.html|title=Environmental Guidelines for Paintings - Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 10/4|last=Canadian Conservation Institute|first=|date=|website=Government of Canadq|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Integrated pest management ===
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 1140 Damage Done by a Furniture Beetle.jpg|thumb|400x400px|CSIRO ScienceImage 1140 Damage Done by a Furniture Beetle]]
[[Museum integrated pest management|Integrated Pest Management]] policies are created to reduce or limit any problems relating to pests damaging objects within collections. Concepts discussed in Integrated Pest Management Policies include restricting food and sugary drink consumption in exhibition, storage areas and surrounding areas along with maintaining cleanliness in exhibition and storage areas. 
== Examples of causes of damage ==
[[File:Wood warping.png|thumb|Computer rendered illustration of different types of wood warping]]
Damage can also come from: 
* Improper Relative Humidity
** Low Humidity reduces the chemical changes but raises the risks of mechanical damage to the paint by making it more brittle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collectioncare.org/pubs/v2n2p1.html|title=Temperature and Relative Humidity|last=Alten|first=Helen|date=Fall 1999|website=Northern States Conservation Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** High Humidity reduces mechanical damage but raises the risks of biological organisms, e.g. white efflorescence and green-to-black stains&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aem.asm.org/content/65/3/879.full#sec-3|title=Microbial Degradation of Paintings|last=Ciferri|first=Orio|date=|website=American Society for Microbiology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
** High Humidity also raises the risks of curving of the wood over time, forcing the paint to flake off.

==Examination ==

===Structural===

[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 1831 Borer damaged wood.jpg|alt=CSIRO ScienceImage 1831 Borer damaged wood|thumb|CSIRO ScienceImage 1831 Borer damaged wood]]
Proper examination of the object is an initial step in the conservation process. Commonly used technologies include radiography and reflectography. Radiography provides the effective technique in terms of analyzing the condition and preservation work done on the structure of panel paintings. Other uses of radiography can be seen by the opaqueness of specific colors used in the painting, condition of the wood, thickness or density of the wood, and various damage done by pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic35-02-005.html|title=Air-Coupled Ultrasonic System: A New Technology For Detecting Flaws In Paintings On Wooden Panels|last=Murray|first=Alison|date=1996|website=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/pdf/panelpaintings4.pdf|title=Current Approaches to the Structural Conservation of Panel Paintings|last=|first=|date=October 29, 1998|website=The Getty Conservation Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furniture and Larder Beetles can burrow into wood. Illustrations of these beetles can be found through the Insects Limited Incorporated [http://www.insectslimited.com/museum Museum] page. Other examples can be found through Museumpests.net's [http://museumpests.net/identification/ Identification] page.

=== Surface and painting ===

Photographic documentation and the use of magnification with the naked eye used with diffuse and [[raking light]] are common methods used at art museums like the [http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/ophelia/conservation-ophelia/raking-light-and-relief Tate Museum] in the United Kingdom, these are effective tools for initial observation. Causes for damage in the surface of panel paintings can be caused by the structural issues in the wood, these include damage done by wood-boring pests. Damage to the painting can also be caused by the fluctuation of temperatures and relative humidity levels.

==Treatments==

===Structural===

Pests can cause damage to the wood panels used in panel paintings. The pests must be eradicated prior to conservation to ensure the longevity of the object and the conservation work. Examples of treatments include:
* '''Isolation through bagging''' - putting the object in isolation with blotter paper, paper board, tissue or foam sealed in a polyethylene bag and monitored over several weeks or months.
* '''Low Temperature''' - typically putting the object into a freeze (qualified for this type of use). The freezer must reach -20°F (-29°C) and objects must be put into the freezer inside a resealable plastic bag to be froze during 4 hours.
[[File:Cradled panel painting, Aert van der Neer.jpg|thumb|Cradled panel painting, Aert van der Neer]]
Conservators must adapt to the specific case of each panel and must use their experience to their advantage. Structures used in conservation include: 
* '''Custom strainers''' that are curved to match the panel with springs to safely flex.
* [[Cradling (paintings)|'''Cradling''']] - Cradling refers to the addition of support on the rear part of the panels. These must have flexibility to allow for some movement from slight temperature and humidity changes.
* '''Adhesives''' - If there is a simple crack within the panel, adhesives are used in combination of alignment, and moderate compression. All adhesives used must adhere to the "Code of Ethics" and must be reversible.

Treatment of adhesives include:
* Reactivation of hide glues. 
* Adding water-based emulsion glues to existing and failing adhesives.
* Replacing failed adhesives with new ones. 
Examples of adhesives include:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/pdf/panelpaintings1.pdf|title=A Survey of Adhesives for Wood Conservation|last=Williams|first=Donald C.|date=April 1995|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Natural protein adhesives''' - found through animal products such as casein, albumin, fish glue, and animal-hide glue.
* '''Natural resins''' - often seen in historic objects. 
* '''Synthetic resin adhesives''' - "aqueous emulsions of  polyvinyl acetate (PVA) and arecommonly called “white” glues"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Transfer of panel paintings|Transfer of Panel Paintings]] - The transferral of a painting from an often unstable panel to another panel is considered to be a delicate process. This process occurs when there has been a form of degradation in the original panel (possible causes include pest damage (burrowing), warping, or the thinning of the panel). The transfer should be made to a similarly aged panel, made out of the same wood type. The National Gallery in the United Kingdom provides an example with [http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/research/conservation-history Raphael's ''Virgin and Child'']

When a panel is submerged due to flooding, the recommended procedure is to expose the panel painting through a long drying process prior to any further conservation work.

=== Surface and painting ===

[[File:4 The Scientists.JPG|thumb|''The Scientists'' by Rita Greer, 2007]]
The conservation of paintings varies for the different types of oil, acrylic and fresco paintings. These techniques include cleaning, removal and replacement of degraded varnish and the restoration of paint losses. The Tate Museum described that "Cleaning is a particularly delicate and demanding part of conserving and restoring paintings. Layers of dirt, discoloured varnish and old restorations that may be disfiguring or obscuring parts of the composition are painstakingly removed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/our-work/conservation/paintings|title=Conservation – paintings|last=|first=|date=|website=The Tate Museum|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolution of modern paints, that can be used in panel paintings, has contributed to facilitate conservation. "The introduction of synthetic binders—most notably acrylic, alkyd, polyvinyl acetate, and nitrocellulose—has resulted in paints that exhibit fast drying times, reduced yellowing tendencies, a vast range of appearances and handling properties and, in the case of emulsion formulations, great flexibility and the elimination of organic solvents as thinners and diluents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/modpaints/|title=Modern Paints|last=|first=|date=|website=The Getty Conservation Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outreach ==
The Penn Museum, based out of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), created the ''[https://www.penn.museum/sites/artifactlab Artifact Lab],'' where visitors interact with content related to the museum.  The webpage provides a blog and other relevant pages relating to their Artifact Lab and its operations. It has a blog section discussing topics from general cleaning (with objects under different lights), to the use of various scanning technologies (such as X-radiography).

'''Contraction band necrosis''' is a type of uncontrolled [[cell death]] ([[necrosis]]) unique to [[cardiac myocyte]]s and thought to arise in [[Reperfusion injury|reperfusion]] from hypercontraction, which results in [[sarcolemma]]l rupture.&lt;ref name=pmid17530396&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rodríguez-Sinovas A, Abdallah Y, Piper HM, Garcia-Dorado D |title=Reperfusion injury as a therapeutic challenge in patients with acute myocardial infarction |journal=Heart Fail Rev |volume=12 |issue=3-4 |pages=207–16 |date=December 2007 |pmid=17530396 |doi=10.1007/s10741-007-9039-9 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a characteristic [[histologic]] finding of a [[Timeline of myocardial infarction pathology|recent]] [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack) that was partially reperfused.

The name of the [[histopathology|histopathologic]] finding comes from the appearance under the microscope; contraction bands are thick intensely eosinophilic staining bands (typically 4-5 [[micrometre]]s wide) that span the short axis of the myocyte.  They can be thought of extra thick [[striae]], typical of [[cardiac muscle]] and [[striated muscle]].

==Pathophysiology==
Contraction band necrosis is thought to arise by two mechanisms:&lt;ref name=pmid17530396/&gt;

'''Cosmic background radiation''' is [[electromagnetic radiation]] from the big bang.  The origin of this radiation depends on the region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] that is observed. One component is the [[cosmic microwave background]]. This component is [[redshifted]] [[photon]]s that have freely streamed from an [[Recombination (cosmology)|epoch when the Universe became transparent]] for the first time to radiation. Its discovery and detailed observations of its properties are considered one of the major confirmations of the [[Big Bang]]. The discovery (by chance in 1965) of the cosmic background radiation suggests that the early universe was dominated by a radiation field, a field of extremely high temperature and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://whatisusa.info/the-first-minutes-of-the-big-bang/|title=First minutes of the Big Bang|publisher=What is USA News|date=12 March 2014 | accessdate=2013-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect]] shows the phenomena of radiant cosmic background radiation interacting with "electron" clouds distorting the spectrum of the radiation.

There is also background radiation in the [[infrared]], [[x-ray]]s, etc., with different causes, and they can sometimes be resolved into an individual source. See [[cosmic infrared background]] and [[X-ray background]]. See also [[cosmic neutrino background]] and [[extragalactic background light]].

{{Distinguish|Fatalism|Predeterminism|Predictability|Theological determinism}}
{{Certainty}}

'''Determinism''' is the philosophical idea that all events, including moral choices, are determined completely by previously existing causes. Determinism is at times understood to preclude free will because it entails that humans cannot act otherwise than they do. It can also be called as [[hard determinism]] from this point of view. [[Hard determinism]] is a position on the relationship of determinism to free will. The theory holds that the universe is utterly rational because complete knowledge of any given situation assures that unerring knowledge of its future is also possible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/determinism Determinism] Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers suggest variants around this basic definition.&lt;ref name=Doyle&gt;A list of a dozen varieties of determinism is provided in {{cite book |title=Free Will: The Scandal in Philosophy |author=Bob Doyle |pages=145–146 ''ff'' |isbn=0983580200 |year=2011 |publisher=I-Phi Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SeA_gFfHMgoC&amp;pg=PA145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deterministic theories throughout the history of philosophy have sprung from diverse and sometimes overlapping motives and considerations. The opposite of determinism is some kind of [[indeterminism]] (otherwise called nondeterminism). Determinism is often contrasted with [[free will]].&lt;ref name=Franklin&gt;For example, see {{cite book |title=Freewill and determinism: a study of rival conceptions of man |author=Richard Langdon Franklin |year=1968 |publisher=Routledge &amp; K. Paul |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=51wIAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Determinism often is taken to mean ''causal determinism'', which in physics is known as cause-and-effect. It is the concept that [[Event (philosophy)|event]]s within a given [[paradigm]] are bound by [[causality]] in such a way that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. This meaning can be distinguished from other varieties of determinism mentioned below.

Other debates often concern the scope of determined systems, with some maintaining that the entire universe is a single determinate system and others identifying other more limited determinate systems (or [[multiverse]]). Numerous historical debates involve many philosophical positions and varieties of determinism. They include debates concerning determinism and free will, technically denoted as [[compatibilistic]] (allowing the two to coexist) and [[incompatibilistic]] (denying their coexistence is a possibility). Determinism should not be confused with [[Self-determination_theory|self-determination]] of human actions by reasons, motives, and desires. Determinism rarely requires that perfect [[prediction]] be practically possible.

==Varieties==
"Determinism" may commonly refer to any of the following viewpoints:

[[File:Bled (9664110474).jpg|thumb|right|140px|Many philosophical theories of determinism frame themselves with the idea that reality follows a sort of predetermined path.]]
* Causal determinism is "the idea that every event is necessitated by antecedent events and conditions together with the laws of nature".&lt;ref name="SEPcausaldeterminism"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Hoefer |first=Carl | title=Causal Determinism | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2009 edition) |date=Apr 1, 2008 |editor=Edward N. Zalta, ed |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2009/entries/determinism-causal/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, causal determinism is a broad enough term to consider that "one's deliberations, choices, and actions will often be necessary links in the causal chain that brings something about. In other words, even though our deliberations, choices, and actions are themselves determined like everything else, it is still the case, according to causal determinism, that the occurrence or existence of yet other things depends upon our deliberating, choosing and acting in a certain way".&lt;ref name="SEPmoralresponsibility"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Eshleman |first=Andrew |editor=Edward N. Zalta, ed |title=Moral Responsibility | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Winter 2009 |date=Nov 18, 2009 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/moral-responsibility/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. The relation between events may not be specified, nor the origin of that universe. Causal determinists believe that there is nothing in the universe that is uncaused or [[causa sui|self-caused]]. [[Historical determinism]] (a sort of [[path dependence]]) can also be synonymous with causal determinism. Causal determinism has also been considered more generally as the idea that everything that happens or exists is caused by antecedent conditions.&lt;ref name=StanfordIncompatibilism&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incompatibilism-arguments/ Arguments for Incompatibilism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of nomological determinism, these conditions are considered events also, implying that the future is determined completely by preceding events&amp;mdash;a combination of prior states of the universe and the laws of nature.&lt;ref name="SEPcausaldeterminism"/&gt; Yet they can also be considered metaphysical of origin (such as in the case of theological determinism).&lt;ref name="SEPmoralresponsibility"/&gt;
** {{anchor|Nomological determinism}} Nomological determinism is the most common form of causal determinism. It is the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. Nomological determinism is sometimes illustrated by the [[thought experiment]] of [[Laplace's demon]].&lt;ref name=laplace&gt;
[[Laplace]] posited that an omniscient observer knowing with infinite precision all the positions and velocities of every particle in the universe could predict the future entirely. For a discussion, see {{cite book |title=The Big Questions: A Short Introduction to Philosophy |author1=Robert C. Solomon |author2=Kathleen M. Higgins |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekh2AKqXdqgC&amp;pg=PA232 |page=232 |isbn=0495595152 |publisher=Cengage Learning |chapter=Free will and determinism|year=2009 |edition=8th}} Another view of determinism is discussed by {{cite book |title=The Structure of Science: Problems in the Logic of Scientific Explanation |author=Ernest Nagel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u6EycHgRfkQC&amp;pg=PA285 |pages =285–292 |chapter=§V: Alternative descriptions of physical state |quote=a theory is deterministic if, and only if, given its state variables for some initial period, the theory logically determines a unique set of values for those variables for any other period. |isbn=0915144719 |year=1999 |publisher=Hackett |edition=2nd }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Nomological determinism is sometimes called 'scientific' determinism, although that is a misnomer. Physical determinism is generally used synonymously with nomological determinism (its opposite being [[Indeterminism|physical indeterminism]]).
** [[Necessitarianism]] is closely related to the causal determinism described above. It is a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] principle that denies all mere possibility; there is exactly one way for the world to be. [[Leucippus]] claimed there were no uncaused events, and that everything occurs for a reason and by necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Leucippus, Fragment 569 - from Fr. 2 Actius I, 25, 4&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Predeterminism]] is the idea that all events are determined in advance.&lt;ref name="McKewan"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=McKewan |first=Jaclyn |editor=H. James Birx"|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Time: Science, Philosophy, Theology, &amp; Culture |title=Predeterminism |year=2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc. |doi=10.4135/9781412963961.n191 |pages=1035–1036|chapter=Evolution, Chemical |isbn=9781412941648 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionaries |title=Predeterminism |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/predeterminism |accessdate=20 December 2012 |date=April 2010 |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries}}. See also {{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Collins English Dictionary |title=Predeterminism |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/predeterminism |accessdate=20 December 2012 |publisher=Collins}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of predeterminism is often argued by invoking causal determinism, implying that there is an unbroken [[chain of prior occurrences]] stretching back to the origin of the universe. In the case of predeterminism, this chain of events has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-established chain. Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established causal determinism, in which case it is categorised as a specific type of determinism.&lt;ref name="McKewan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-determinism.html |title=Some Varieties of Free Will and Determinism |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=Philosophy 302: Ethics |publisher=philosophy.lander.edu |accessdate=19 December 2012| quote=Predeterminism: the philosophical and theological view that combines God with determinism.

(Pre-)determinism at the Planck scale |quote=Predeterminism is here defined by the assumption that the experimenter's 'free will' in deciding what to measure (such as his choice to measure the x- or the y-component of an electron's spin), is in fact limited by deterministic laws, hence not free at all |eprint=hep-th/0104219 |year=2001}}, and {{cite journal |author=Sukumar, CV |title=A new paradigm for science and architecture |quote=Quantum Theory provided a beautiful description of the behaviour of isolated atoms and nuclei and small aggregates of elementary particles.

* [[Fatalism]] is normally distinguished from "determinism",&lt;ref name=SEPDeterminism&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/ SEP, Causal Determinism]&lt;/ref&gt; as a form of teleological determinism. Fatalism is the idea that everything is fated to happen, so that humans have no control over their future. [[Fate]] has arbitrary power, and need not follow any causal or otherwise deterministic [[law]]s.&lt;ref name="StanfordIncompatibilism"/&gt; Types of fatalism include hard [[theological determinism]] and the idea of [[predestination]], where there is a [[God]] who determines all that humans will do. This may be accomplished either by knowing their actions in advance, via some form of [[omniscience]]&lt;ref name = "Fischer"&gt;Fischer, John Martin (1989) ''God, Foreknowledge and Freedom''. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|1-55786-857-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by decreeing their actions in advance.&lt;ref name="Watt"&gt;Watt, Montgomery (1948) ''Free-Will and Predestination in Early Islam''. London:Luzac &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Theological determinism]] is a form of determinism that holds that all events that happen are pre-ordained, or [[predestination|predestined]] to happen, by a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[deity]], or that they are [[destiny|destined]] to occur given its [[omniscience]]. Two forms of theological determinism exist, here referenced as strong and weak theological determinism.&lt;ref name=JordanTate2004&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anne Lockyer Jordan|author2=Anne Lockyer Jordan Neil Lockyer Edwin Tate|author3=Neil Lockyer|author4=Edwin Tate|title=Philosophy of Religion for A Level OCR Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBVuNip8qjkC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 June 2004|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-0-7487-8078-5|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first one, strong theological determinism, is based on the concept of a [[creator deity]] dictating all events in history: "everything that happens has been predestined to happen by an omniscient, omnipotent divinity".&lt;ref name=Iannone2001&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Pabl Iannone|title=Dictionary of World Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wBmBO3vpE4C|accessdate=22 December 2012|year=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-17995-9|page=194|chapter=determinism|quote=theological determinism, or the doctrine of predestination: the view that everything which happens has been predestined to happen by an omniscient, omnipotent divinity. A weaker version holds that, though not predestined to happen, everything that happens has been eternally known by virtue of the divine foreknowledge of an omniscient divinity. If this divinity is also omnipotent, as in the case of the Judeo-Christian religions, this weaker version is hard to distinguish from the previous one because, though able to prevent what happens and knowing that it is going to happen, God lets it happen. To this, advocates of free will reply that God permits it to happen in order to make room for the free will of humans.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second form, weak theological determinism, is based on the concept of divine foreknowledge&amp;mdash;"because [[God]]'s omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the future will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed".&lt;ref name=Huyssteen2003&gt;{{cite book|author=Wentzel Van Huyssteen|title=Encyclopedia of science and religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIcYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 December 2012|volume=1|year=2003|publisher=Macmillan Reference|isbn=978-0-02-865705-9|page=217|chapter=theological determinism|quote=Theological determinism constitutes a fifth kind of determinism. There are two types of theological determinism, both compatible with scientific and metaphysical determinism. In the first, God determines everything that happens, either in one all-determining single act at the initial creation of the universe or through continuous divine interactions with the world. Either way, the consequence is that everything that happens becomes God's action, and determinism is closely linked to divine action and God's omnipotence. According to the second type of theological determinism, God has perfect knowledge of everything in the universe because God is omniscient. And, as some say, because God is outside of time, God has the capacity of knowing past, present, and future in one instance. This means that God knows what will happen in the future. And because God's omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the future will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There exist slight variations on the above categorisation. Some claim that theological determinism requires [[predestination]] of all events and outcomes by the divinity (i.e. they do not classify the weaker version as 'theological determinism' unless libertarian free will is assumed to be denied as a consequence), or that the weaker version does not constitute 'theological determinism' at all.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond J.

We might think of God here as the all-powerful movie director who writes script and causes everything to go accord with it. We should note, as an aside, that there is some debate over what would be sufficient for theological determinism to be true.

* Logical determinism or ''Determinateness'' is the notion that all propositions, whether about the past, present, or future, are either [[Law of excluded middle|true or false]]. Note that one can support causal determinism without necessarily supporting logical determinism and vice versa (depending on one's views on the nature of [[time]], but also [[randomness]]). The problem of free will is especially salient now with logical determinism: how can choices be free, given that propositions about the future already have a truth value in the present (i.e. it is already determined as either true or false)? This is referred to as the [[problem of future contingents]]. [[File:Iimatyas.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Adequate determinism focuses on [[quantum mechanics|the fact that]], even without a full understanding of microscopic physics, we can predict the distribution of 1000 coin tosses.]]
** Often synonymous with logical determinism are the ideas behind spatio-temporal determinism or [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]]: the view of special relativity. [[J. J. C. Smart]], a proponent of this view, uses the term "tenselessness" to describe the simultaneous existence of past, present, and future. In physics, the "block universe" of [[Hermann Minkowski]] and [[Albert Einstein]] assumes that time is a fourth dimension (like the three spatial dimensions). In other words, all the other parts of time are real, like the city blocks up and down a street, although the order in which they appear depends on the driver (see [[Rietdijk–Putnam argument]]).
* Adequate determinism is the idea that [[quantum indeterminacy]] can be ignored for most macroscopic events. This is because of [[quantum decoherence]]. Random quantum events "average out" in the [[Expected value|limit of large numbers]] of particles (where the laws of quantum mechanics asymptotically approach the laws of classical mechanics).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/adequate_determinism.html The Information Philosopher website], "Adequate Determinism", from the site: "''We are happy to agree with scientists and philosophers who feel that quantum effects are for the most part negligible in the macroscopic world. We particularly agree that they are negligible when considering the causally determined will and the causally determined actions set in motion by decisions of that will.''"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Hawking]] explains a similar idea: he says that the microscopic world of [[quantum mechanics]] is one of determined probabilities. That is, quantum effects rarely alter the predictions of [[classical mechanics]], which are quite accurate (albeit still [[Uncertainty principle|not perfectly certain]]) at larger scales.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Grand Design (book)|Grand Design]] (2010), page 32: "the molecular basis of biology shows that biological processes are governed by the laws of physics and chemistry and therefore are as determined as the orbits of the planets.", and page 72: ''"Quantum physics might seem to undermine the idea that nature is governed by laws, but that is not the case. Instead it leads us to accept a new form of determinism: Given the state of a system at some time, the laws of nature determine the probabilities of various futures and pasts rather than determining the future and past with certainty."'' (emphasis in original, discussing a [[Many worlds interpretation]])&lt;/ref&gt; Something as large as an [[cell (biology)|animal cell]], then, would be "adequately determined" (even in light of quantum indeterminacy).
* The [[many-worlds interpretation]] accepts the linear causal sets of sequential events with adequate consistency yet also suggests constant forking of causal chains creating "multiple universes" to account for multiple outcomes from single events.&lt;ref&gt;Kent, Adrian. "One world versus many: the inadequacy of Everettian accounts of evolution, probability, and scientific confirmation." Many worlds (2010): 307–354.&lt;/ref&gt;  Meaning the causal set of events leading to the present are all valid yet appear as a singular linear time stream within a much broader unseen conic probability field of other outcomes that "split off" from the locally observed timeline.  Under this model causal sets are still "consistent" yet not exclusive to singular iterated outcomes.  The interpretation side steps the exclusive retrospective causal chain problem of "could not have done otherwise" by suggesting "the other outcome does exist" in a set of parallel universe time streams that split off when the action occurred.  This theory is sometimes described with the example of agent based choices but more involved models argue that recursive causal splitting occurs with all particle wave functions at play.&lt;ref&gt;Vaidman, Lev. "Many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics." (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  This model is highly contested with multiple objections from the scientific community.

==Philosophical connections==

===With nature/nurture controversy===
[[File:JuliusOttoGrimm-Sculpture.jpg|thumb|140px|Nature and nurture interact in humans. A scientist looking at a sculpture after some time does not ask whether we are seeing the effects of the starting materials or of environmental influences.]]
Although some of the above forms of determinism concern human behaviors and [[cognition]], others frame themselves as an answer to the debate on [[nature and nurture]]. They will suggest that one factor will entirely determine behavior. As scientific understanding has grown, however, the strongest versions of these theories have been widely rejected as a [[Fallacy of the single cause|single-cause fallacy]].&lt;ref name="melo-martin"&gt;{{cite journal |author=de Melo-Martín I|title=Firing up the nature/nurture controversy: bioethics and genetic determinism |journal=J Med Ethics|volume=31 |issue=9|pages=526–30 |year=2005 |pmid=16131554 |pmc=1734214|doi=10.1136/jme.2004.008417|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, the modern deterministic theories attempt to explain how the interaction of both nature ''and'' nurture is entirely predictable. The concept of [[heritability]] has been helpful in making this distinction.

[[Biological determinism]], sometimes called [[genetic determinism]], is the idea that each of human behaviors, beliefs, and desires are fixed by human genetic nature.

[[Behaviorism]] involves the idea that all behavior can be traced to specific causes—either environmental or reflexive. [[John B. Watson]] and [[B. F. Skinner]] developed this nurture-focused determinism.

[[Cultural determinism]] or [[social determinism]] is the nurture-focused theory that the culture in which we are raised determines who we are.

[[Environmental determinism]], also known as climatic or geographical determinism, proposes that the physical environment, rather than social conditions, determines culture. Supporters of environmental determinism often{{quantify|date=August 2014}} also support [[Behaviorism|Behavioral determinism]]. Key proponents of this notion have included [[Ellen Churchill Semple]], [[Ellsworth Huntington]], [[Thomas Griffith Taylor]] and possibly [[Jared Diamond]], although his status as an environmental determinist is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

===With particular factors===
[[File:Using Mobile Phone 0251.JPG|thumb|right|150px|A technological determinist might suggest that technology like the mobile phone is the greatest factor shaping human civilization.]]
Other 'deterministic' theories actually seek only to highlight the importance of a particular factor in predicting the future. These theories often use the factor as a sort of guide or constraint on the future. They need not suppose that complete knowledge of that one factor would allow us to make perfect predictions.

[[Psychological determinism]] can mean that humans must act according to reason, but it can also be synonymous with some sort of [[Psychological egoism]]. The latter is the view that humans will always act according to their perceived best interest.

[[Linguistic determinism]] claims that our language determines (at least limits) the things we can think and say and thus know. The [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] argues that individuals experience the world based on the grammatical structures they habitually use.

[[Economic determinism]] attributes primacy to economic structure over politics in the development of human history. It is associated with the [[dialectical materialism]] of [[Karl Marx]].

[[Technological determinism]] is a reductionist theory that presumes that a society's technology drives the development of its social structure and cultural values.

===With free will===
{{Main article|Free will}}
[[File:DeterminismXFreeWill.svg|thumb|right|300px|A table showing the different positions related to free will and determinism]]
Philosophers have debated both the truth of determinism, and the truth of free will. This creates the four possible positions in the figure. [[Compatibilism]] refers to the view that [[free will]] is, in some sense, compatible with determinism. The three [[incompatibilist]] positions, on the other hand, deny this possibility. The [[hard incompatibilism|hard incompatibilists]] hold that both determinism and free will do not exist, the [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarianists]] that determinism does not hold, and free will might exist, and the [[hard determinism|hard determinists]] that determinism does hold and free will does not exist.

The standard argument against free will, according to philosopher [[J. J. C. Smart]] focuses on the implications of determinism for 'free will'.&lt;ref&gt;J. J. C. Smart, "Free-Will, Praise and Blame,"''Mind'', July 1961, p.293-4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he suggests free will is denied whether determinism is true or not. On one hand, if determinism is true, all our actions are predicted and we are assumed not to be free; on the other hand, if determinism is false, our actions are presumed to be random and as such we do not seem free because we had no part in controlling what happened.

In his book, ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'', author and neuroscientist [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] also argues against free will. He offers one thought experiment where a mad scientist represents determinism. In Harris' example, the mad scientist uses a machine to control all the desires, and thus all the behavior, of a particular human. Harris believes that it is no longer as tempting, in this case, to say the victim has "free will". Harris says nothing changes if the machine controls desires at random - the victim still seems to lack free will. Harris then argues that we are also the victims of such unpredictable desires (but due to the unconscious machinations of our brain, rather than those of a mad scientist). Based on this introspection, he writes "This discloses the real mystery of free will: if our experience is compatible with its utter absence, how can we say that we see any evidence for it in the first place?"&lt;ref&gt;Sam Harris, The Moral Landscape (2010), pg.216, note102&lt;/ref&gt; adding that "Whether they are predictable or not, we do not cause our causes."&lt;ref&gt;Sam Harris, The Moral Landscape (2010), pg.217, note109&lt;/ref&gt; That is, he believes there is compelling [[evidence of absence]] of free will.

===With the soul===
Some determinists argue that [[materialism]] does not present a complete understanding of the universe, because while it can describe determinate interactions among material things, it ignores the [[mind]]s or [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s of conscious beings.

A number of positions can be delineated:

# Immaterial souls are all that exist ([[Idealism]]).
# Immaterial souls exist and exert a non-deterministic causal influence on bodies. (Traditional free-will, [[interactionist dualism]]).&lt;ref&gt;By 'soul' in the context of (1) is meant an [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomous]] immaterial agent that has the power to control the body but not to be controlled by the body (this theory of determinism thus conceives of conscious agents in [[Mind-body dualism|dualistic]] terms). Therefore the soul stands to the activities of the individual agent's body as does the creator of the universe to the universe. The creator of the universe put in motion a deterministic system of material entities that would, if left to themselves, carry out the chain of events determined by ordinary causation. But the creator also provided for souls that could exert a causal force analogous to the primordial causal force and alter outcomes in the physical universe via the acts of their bodies. Thus, it emerges that no events in the physical universe are uncaused. Some are caused entirely by the original creative act and the way it plays itself out through time, and some are caused by the acts of created souls. But those created souls were not created by means of physical processes involving ordinary causation. They are another order of being entirely, gifted with the power to modify the original creation. However, determinism is not necessarily limited to matter; it can encompass energy as well. The question of how these immaterial entities can act upon material entities is deeply involved in what is generally known as the [[mind-body problem]]. It is a significant problem which philosophers have not reached agreement about&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/ Free Will (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Immaterial souls exist, but are part of deterministic framework.
# Immaterial souls exist, but exert no causal influence, free or determined ([[epiphenomenalism]], [[occasionalism]])
# Immaterial souls do not exist — there is no [[mind-body problem|mind-body]] [[dichotomy]], and there is a [[Materialism|Materialistic]] explanation for intuitions to the contrary.

===With ethics and morality===
Another topic of debate is the implication that Determinism has on [[Ethics|morality]]. [[Hard determinism]] (a belief in determinism, and not free will) is particularly criticized for seeming to make traditional moral judgments impossible. Some philosophers, however, find this an acceptable conclusion.

Philosopher and incompatibilist [[Peter van Inwagen]] introduces this thesis as such:

Argument that [[Free Will]] is Required for Moral Judgments
# The moral judgment that you shouldn't have done X implies that you should have done something else instead
# That you should have done something else instead implies that there was something else for you to do
# That there was something else for you to do implies that you could have done something else
# That you could have done something else implies that you have free will
# If you don't have free will to have done other than X we cannot make the moral judgment that you shouldn't have done X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=van Inwagen|first=Peter|title=The Powers of Rational Beings: Freedom of the Will|year=2009|publisher=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a compatibilist might have an issue with Inwagen's process because one can not change the past like his arguments center around. A compatibilist who centers around plans for the future might posit:
# The moral judgment that you should not have done X implies that you can do something else instead
# That you can do something else instead implies that there is something else for you to do
# That there is something else for you to do implies that you can do something else
# That you can do something else implies that you have free will for planning future recourse
# If you have free will to do other than X we can make the moral judgment that you should do other than X, and punishing you as a responsible party for having done X that you know you should not have done can help you remember to not do X in the future.

== History ==
Determinism has been established by the Greek philosophers, during the 7th and 6th centuries BC by the Presocratics Heraclitus, Leucippus and mainly by the Stoics with the universal causal determinism and Aristotle. Some of the main philosophers who have dealt with this issue are [[Marcus Aurelius]], [[Omar Khayyám]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[David Hume]], [[Baron d'Holbach]] (Paul Heinrich Dietrich), [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[William James]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Niels Bohr]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and, more recently, [[John Searle]], [[Sam Harris]], [[Ted Honderich]], and [[Daniel Dennett]].

Mecca Chiesa notes that the [[probabilistic]] or selectionistic determinism of [[B.F. Skinner]] comprised a wholly separate conception of determinism that was not [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] at all. Mechanistic determinism assumes that every event has an unbroken chain of prior occurrences, but a selectionistic or probabilistic model does not.&lt;ref&gt;Chiesa, Mecca (2004) ''Radical Behaviorism: The Philosophy &amp; The Science''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ringen | first1 = J.

===Western tradition===
In the West, some elements of determinism have been expressed in Greece from the 6th century BC by the Presocratics Heraclitus&lt;ref&gt;Stobaeus ''Eclogae'' I 5 ([[Heraclitus]])&lt;/ref&gt;  and Leucippus.&lt;ref&gt;Stobaeus ''Eclogae'' I 4 ([[Leucippus]])&lt;/ref&gt; The first full-fledged notion of determinism appears to originate with the [[Stoics]], as part of their theory of universal causal determinism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bobzien]] ''Determinism and Freedom in Stoic Philosophy'' (Oxford 1998) chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting philosophical debates, which involved the confluence of elements of Aristotelian Ethics with Stoic psychology, led in the 1st-3rd centuries CE in the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] to the first recorded Western debate over determinism and freedom,&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Bobzien ''The Inadvertent Conception and Late Birth of the Free-Will Problem'' (Phronesis 43, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; an issue that is known in theology as the [[Argument from free will|paradox of free will]]. The writings of [[Epictetus]] as well as [[Middle Platonist]] and early Christian thought were instrumental in this development.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Frede]] ''A Free Will: Origins of the Notion in Ancient Thought'' (Berkeley 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish philosopher [[Moses Maimonides]] said of the deterministic implications of an omniscient god:&lt;ref&gt;Though Moses Maimonides was not arguing against the existence of God, but rather for the incompatibility between the full '''exercise''' by God of his [[omniscience]] and genuine human [[free will]], his argument is considered by some as affected by Modal Fallacy. See, in particular, the article by Prof. Norman Swartz for ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://www.iep.utm.edu/f/foreknow.htm Foreknowledge and Free Will] and specifically [http://www.iep.utm.edu/f/foreknow.htm#section6 Section 6: The Modal Fallacy]&lt;/ref&gt; "Does God know or does He not know that a certain individual will be good or bad? If thou sayest 'He knows', then it necessarily follows that [that] man is compelled to act as God knew beforehand he would act, otherwise God's knowledge would be imperfect.…"&lt;ref name=maimonides&gt;''The Eight Chapters of Maimonides on Ethics (Semonah Perakhim)'', edited, annotated, and translated with an Introduction by Joseph I. Gorfinkle, pp. 99–100. (New York: AMS Press), 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

Determinism in the West is often associated with [[Newtonian physics]], which depicts the physical matter of the universe as operating according to a set of fixed, knowable laws. The "billiard ball" hypothesis, a product of Newtonian physics, argues that once the initial conditions of the universe have been established, the rest of the history of the universe follows inevitably. If it were actually possible to have complete knowledge of physical matter and all of the laws governing that matter at any one time, then it would be theoretically possible to compute the time and place of every event that will ever occur (''[[Laplace's demon]]''). In this sense, the basic particles of the universe operate in the same fashion as the rolling balls on a billiard table, moving and striking each other in predictable ways to produce predictable results.

Whether or not it is all-encompassing in so doing, Newtonian mechanics deals only with caused events, e.g.: If an object begins in a known position and is hit dead on by an object with some known velocity, then it will be pushed straight toward another predictable point. If it goes somewhere else, the Newtonians argue, one must question one's measurements of the original position of the object, the exact direction of the striking object, gravitational or other fields that were inadvertently ignored, etc. Then, they maintain, repeated experiments and improvements in accuracy will always bring one's observations closer to the theoretically predicted results. When dealing with situations on an ordinary human scale, Newtonian physics has been so enormously successful that it has no competition. But it fails spectacularly as velocities become some substantial fraction of the [[speed of light]] and when interactions at the atomic scale are studied. Before the discovery of [[Introduction to quantum mechanics|quantum]] effects and other challenges to Newtonian physics, "uncertainty" was always a term that applied to the accuracy of human knowledge about causes and effects, and not to the causes and effects themselves.

[[Newtonian mechanics]] as well as any following physical theories are results of observations and experiments, and so they describe "how it all works" within a tolerance. However, old western scientists believed if there are any logical connections found between an observed cause and effect, there must be also some absolute natural laws behind. Belief in perfect natural laws driving everything, instead of just describing what we should expect, led to searching for a set of universal simple laws that rule the world. This movement significantly encouraged deterministic views in western philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, Norman (2003) The Concept of Physical Law / Chapter 10: Free Will and Determinism ( https://www.sfu.ca/philosophy/physical-law/)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the related theological views of [[Classical Pantheism]].

=== Eastern tradition ===
{{Original research section|date=December 2010}}
The idea that the entire universe is a [[deterministic system (philosophy)|deterministic system]] has been articulated in both Eastern and non-Eastern religion, philosophy, and literature.

In ''[[I Ching]]'' and [[Philosophical Taoism]], the ebb and flow of favorable and unfavorable conditions suggests the path of least resistance is effortless (see [[wu wei]]).

In the philosophical schools of India, the concept of precise and continual effect of laws of [[Karma]] on the existence of all sentient beings is analogous to western deterministic concept. Karma is the concept of "action" or "deed" in Indian religions. It is understood as that which causes the entire cycle of cause and effect (i.e., the cycle called saṃsāra) originating in ancient India and treated in Hindu, Jain, and Sikh. Karma is considered predetermined and deterministic in the universe, and in combination with the decisions (free will) of living beings, accumulates to determine futuristic situations that the living being encounters.

=== Generative processes ===
{{Main article|Emergence}}
Although it was once thought by scientists that any indeterminism in quantum mechanics occurred at too small a scale to influence biological or neurological systems, there is indication that [[nervous system]]s are influenced by quantum indeterminism due to [[chaos theory]]{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}. It is unclear what implications this has for the problem of [[free will]] given various possible reactions to the problem in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1142/S0219635206001112 | last=Lewis | first=E.R. |author2=MacGregor, R.J. | year=2006 | title=On Indeterminism, Chaos, and Small Number Particle Systems in the Brain | journal=[[Journal of Integrative Neuroscience]] | volume=5 | issue=2 | pages=223–247 |url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~lewis/LewisMacGregor.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many biologists don't grant determinism: Christof Koch argues against it, and in favour of [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian free will]], by making arguments based on generative processes ([[emergence]]).&lt;ref name=Koch&gt;{{cite book |last1=Koch |first1=Christof |authorlink1=Christof Koch |editor1-first=Nancy|editor1-last=Murphy |editor2-first=George |editor2-last=Ellis |editor3-first=Timothy|editor3-last=O'Connor |title=Downward Causation and the Neurobiology of Free Will |url= |date=September 2009 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |location=New York, USA|isbn=978-3-642-03204-2 |pages= |chapter=Free Will, Physics, Biology and the Brain}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other proponents of emergentist or [[emergence|generative philosophy]], [[cognitive science]]s and [[evolutionary psychology]], argue that a certain form of determinism (not necessarily causal) is true.&lt;ref name= "Kenrick"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kenrick | first1 = D.

[[File:Gospers glider gun.gif|thumb|right|120px|In [[Conway's Game of Life]], the interaction of just four simple rules creates patterns that seem somehow "alive".]]

As an illustration, the strategy board-games [[chess]] and [[Go (game)|Go]] have rigorous rules in which no information (such as cards' face-values) is hidden from either player and no [[randomness|random]] events (such as dice-rolling) happen within the game. Yet, chess and especially Go with its extremely simple deterministic rules, can still have an extremely large number of unpredictable moves. When chess is simplified to 7 or fewer pieces, however, endgame tables are available that dictate which moves to play to achieve a perfect game.  This implies that, given a less complex environment (with the original 32 pieces reduced to 7 or fewer pieces), a perfectly predictable game of chess is possible.  In this scenario, the winning player can announce that a checkmate will happen within a given number of moves, assuming a perfect defense by the losing player, or fewer moves if the defending player chooses sub-optimal moves as the game progresses into its inevitable, predicted conclusion. By this analogy, it is suggested, the experience of free will emerges from the interaction of finite rules and deterministic parameters that generate nearly infinite and practically unpredictable behavioural responses. In theory, if all these events could be accounted for, and there were a known way to evaluate these events, the seemingly unpredictable behaviour would become predictable.&lt;ref name= "Kenrick"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Nowak"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Axtell"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Epstein"/&gt; Another hands-on example of generative processes is [[John Horton Conway]]'s playable [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/ John Conway's Game of Life]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb|Nassim Taleb]] is wary of such models, and coined the term "[[ludic fallacy]]".

=== Compatibility with the existence of science ===
Certain [[philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] argue that while causal determinism in which everything including the brain/mind is subject to the laws of causality is compatible with minds capable of science, fatalism and predestination is not. These philosophers make the distinction that causal determinism means that each step is determined by the step before and therefore allows sensory input from observational data to determine what conclusions the [[brain]] reaches, while fatalism in which the steps between do not connect an initial cause to the results would make it impossible for observational data to correct false hypotheses. This is often combined with the argument that if the brain had fixed views and the arguments were mere after-constructs with no causal effect on the conclusions, science would have been impossible and the use of arguments would have been a meaningless waste of energy with no persuasive effect on brains with fixed views.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper: Conjectures and refutations&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematical models ===
Many [[mathematical models]] of physical systems are deterministic. This is true of most models involving [[differential equations]] (notably, those measuring rate of change over time). Mathematical models that are not deterministic because they involve randomness are called [[stochastic]]. Because of [[sensitive dependence on initial conditions]], some deterministic models may appear to behave non-deterministically; in such cases, a deterministic interpretation of the model may not be useful due to [[numerical instability]] and a finite amount of [[accuracy and precision|precision]] in measurement. Such considerations can motivate the consideration of a stochastic model even though the underlying system is governed by deterministic equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Werndl | first1 = Charlotte | year = 2009 | title = Are Deterministic Descriptions and Indeterministic Descriptions Observationally Equivalent? | doi = 10.1016/j.shpsb.2009.06.004 | journal = Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 232–242 | bibcode = 2009SHPMP..40..232W | arxiv = 1310.1615 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werndl, Charlotte (2009).

=== Quantum and Classical Mechanics ===

====Day-to-day physics====
{{further information|Macroscopic quantum phenomena}}
Since the beginning of the 20th century, [[quantum mechanics]]—the physics of the extremely small—has revealed previously concealed aspects of [[Phenomenon|event]]s. Before that, [[classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]]—the physics of everyday life—dominated. Taken in isolation (rather than as an [[approximation]] to quantum mechanics), Newtonian physics depicts a universe in which objects move in perfectly determined ways. At the scale where humans exist and interact with the universe, Newtonian mechanics remain useful, and make relatively accurate predictions (e.g. calculating the trajectory of a bullet). But whereas in theory, [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute knowledge]] of the forces accelerating a bullet would produce an absolutely accurate prediction of its path, modern quantum mechanics casts reasonable doubt on this main thesis of determinism.

Relevant is the fact that [[certainty]] is never absolute in practice (and not just because of David Hume's [[problem of induction]]). The equations of Newtonian mechanics can exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This is an example of the [[butterfly effect]], which is one of the subjects of [[chaos theory]]. The idea is that something even as small as a butterfly could cause a chain reaction leading to a hurricane years later. Consequently, even a very small error in knowledge of initial conditions can result in arbitrarily large deviations from predicted behavior. Chaos theory thus explains why it may be practically impossible to [[predict]] real life, whether determinism is true or false. On the other hand, the issue may not be so much about human abilities to ''predict'' or attain ''certainty'' as much as it is the nature of reality itself. For that, a closer, scientific look at nature is necessary.

====[[Quantum realm]]====
Quantum physics works differently in many ways from Newtonian physics. Physicist [[Aaron D. O'Connell]] explains that understanding our universe, at such small scales as atoms, requires a different logic than day-to-day life does. O'Connell does not deny that it is all interconnected: the scale of human existence ultimately does emerge from the quantum scale. O'Connell argues that we must simply use different models and constructs when dealing with the quantum world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ted.com/2011/06/02/struggling-with-quantum-logic-qa-with-aaron-oconnell/ "Struggling with quantum logic: Q&amp;A with Aaron O'Connell]&lt;/ref&gt; Quantum mechanics is the product of a careful application of the [[scientific method]], [[logic]] and [[empiricism]]. The [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] is frequently confused with the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]]. The uncertainty principle actually describes how precisely we may measure the position and momentum of a particle at the same time &amp;mdash; if we increase the accuracy in measuring one quantity, we are forced to lose accuracy in measuring the other. "These uncertainty relations give us that measure of freedom from the limitations of classical concepts which is necessary for a consistent description of atomic processes."&lt;ref name="Heisenberg1930"&gt;{{cite book |first=Werner |last=Heisenberg |authorlink=Werner Heisenberg|year=1949 |title=Physikalische Prinzipien der Quantentheorie |trans-title=Physical Principles of Quantum Theory |location=Leipzig |publisher=Hirzel/University of Chicago Press |page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NzMBh4ZxKJsC&amp;pg=PA4|isbn=9780486601137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Double-slit experiment results Tanamura 2.jpg|thumb|right|Although it is not possible to predict the trajectory of any one particle, they all obey determined probabilities which do permit some prediction.]]
This is where [[statistical mechanics]] come into play, and where physicists begin to require rather unintuitive mental models: A particle's path simply cannot be exactly specified in its full quantum description. "Path" is a classical, practical attribute in our every day life, but one that quantum particles do not meaningfully possess. The probabilities discovered in quantum mechanics do nevertheless arise from measurement (of the perceived path of the particle). As [[Stephen Hawking]] explains, the result is not traditional determinism, but rather determined probabilities.&lt;ref name=GDesign&gt;[[The Grand Design (book)|Grand Design]] (2010), page 32: ''"the molecular basis of biology shows that biological processes are governed by the laws of physics and chemistry and therefore are as determined as the orbits of the planets...so it seems that we are no more than biological machines and that free will is just an illusion"'', and page 72: ''"Quantum physics might seem to undermine the idea that nature is governed by laws, but that is not the case. Instead it leads us to accept a new form of determinism: Given the state of a system at some time, the laws of nature determine the probabilities of various futures and pasts rather than determining the future and past with certainty."'' (discussing a [[Many worlds interpretation]])&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, a quantum particle may indeed trace an exact path, and the probability of finding the particles in that path is one (certain to be true). In fact, as far as prediction goes, the quantum development is at least as predictable as the classical motion, but the key is that it describes [[wave function]]s that cannot be easily expressed in ordinary language. As far as the thesis of determinism is concerned, these probabilities, at least, are quite determined. These findings from quantum mechanics have found many [[Quantum mechanics#Applications|applications]], and allow us to build [[transistors]] and [[lasers]]. Put another way: personal computers, Blu-ray players and the internet all work because humankind discovered the determined probabilities of the quantum world.&lt;ref name="WhatIsItGoodFor?"&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=everyday-quantum-physics Scientific American, "What is Quantum Mechanics Good For?"]&lt;/ref&gt; None of that should be taken to imply that other aspects of [[quantum mechanics]] are not still [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|up for debate]].

On the topic of predictable probabilities, the [[double-slit experiment]]s are a popular example. [[Photon]]s are fired one-by-one through a double-slit apparatus at a distant screen. Curiously, they do not arrive at any single point, nor even the two points lined up with the slits (the way you might expect of bullets fired by a fixed gun at a distant target). Instead, the light arrives in varying concentrations at widely separated points, and the distribution of its collisions with the target can be calculated reliably. In that sense the behavior of light in this apparatus is deterministic, but there is no way to predict where in the resulting [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] pattern any individual [[photon]] will make its contribution (although, there may be ways to use [[weak measurement]] to acquire more information without violating the [[Uncertainty principle]]).

Some (including [[Albert Einstein]]) argue that our inability to predict any more than probabilities is simply due to ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein]] insisted that, "I am convinced God does not play dice" in a private letter to [[Max Born]], 4 December 1926, [http://www.alberteinstein.info/db/ViewDetails.do?DocumentID=38009 Albert Einstein Archives] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819045822/http://www.alberteinstein.info/db/ViewDetails.do?DocumentID=38009 |date=19 August 2010 }} reel 8, item 180&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that, beyond the conditions and laws we can observe or deduce, there are also hidden factors or "[[Hidden variable theory|hidden variable]]s" that determine ''absolutely'' in which order photons reach the detector screen. They argue that the course of the universe is absolutely determined, but that humans are screened from knowledge of the determinative factors. So, they say, it only appears that things proceed in a merely probabilistically determinative way. In actuality, they proceed in an absolutely deterministic way.

[[John S. Bell]] criticized Einstein's work in his famous [[Bell's Theorem]], which proved that quantum mechanics can make statistical predictions that would be violated if local hidden variables really existed. A number of experiments have tried to verify such predictions, and so far they do not appear to be violated. Improved continue to verify the result, including the 2015 "[[Bell test experiments#Hensen et al..2C Giustina et al..2C Shalm et al. .282015.29: .22loophole-free.22 Bell tests|Loophole Free Test]]" that plugged all known sources of error and the 2017 "[[Bell test experiments#Johannes Handsteiner et al. .282017.29: .22Cosmic Bell Test.22 - Measurement Settings from Milky Way Stars|Cosmic Bell Test]]" that based the experiment cosmic data streaming from different directions toward the Earth, precluding the possibility the sources of data could have had prior interactions. However, it is possible to augment quantum mechanics with non-local hidden variables to achieve a deterministic theory that is in agreement with experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jabs | first=Arthur | year=2016 | title= A conjecture concerning determinism, reduction, and measurement in quantum mechanics | doi= 10.1007/s40509-016-0077-7 | journal= Quantum Studies: Mathematics and Foundations | volume= 3 | issue= 4 | pages=279–292| arxiv=1204.0614 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the [[Bohm interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. Bohm's Interpretation, though, violates special relativity and it is highly controversial whether or not it can be reconciled without giving up on determinism.

More advanced variations on these arguments include [[Quantum contextuality]], by Bell, [[Simon B. Kochen]] and [[Ernst Specker]] in which argues that hidden variable theories cannot be "sensible," which here means that the values of the hidden variables inherently depend on the devices used to measure them.

This debate is relevant because it is easy to imagine specific situations in which the arrival of an electron at a screen at a certain point and time would trigger one event, whereas its arrival at another point would trigger an entirely different event (e.g. see [[Schrödinger's cat]] - a thought experiment used as part of a deeper debate).

Thus, quantum physics casts reasonable doubt on the traditional determinism of classical, Newtonian physics in so far as reality does not seem to be absolutely determined. This was the subject of the famous [[Bohr–Einstein debates]] between Einstein and [[Niels Bohr]] and there is [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics#Comparison|still no consensus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bishop |first1=Robert C. |editor1-first=Robert |editor1-last=Kane |title=The Oxford Handbook of Free Will |edition=Second |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, New York |isbn=9780195399691 | oclc=653483691 |page=90 |chapter=Chaos, Indeterminism, and Free Will |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=kzcFDsWg0GEC&amp;pg=PA90 |quote=The key question is whether to understand the nature of this probability as epistemic or ontic. Along epistemic lines, one possibility is that there is some additional factor (i.e., a hidden mechanism) such that once we discover and understand this factor, we would be able to predict the observed behavior of the quantum stoplight with certainty (physicists call this approach a "hidden variable theory"; see, e.g., Bell 1987, 1–13, 29–39; Bohm 1952a, 1952b; Bohm and Hiley 1993; Bub 1997, 40–114, Holland 1993; see also the preceding essay in this volume by Hodgson). Or perhaps there is an interaction with the broader environment (e.g., neighboring buildings, trees) that we have not taken into account in our observations that explains how these probabilities arise (physicists call this approach decoherence or consistent histories&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;). Under either of these approaches, we would interpret the observed indeterminism in the behavior of stoplights as an expression of our ignorance about the actual workings. Under an ignorance interpretation, indeterminism would not be a fundamental feature of quantum stoplights, but merely epistemic in nature due to our lack of knowledge about the system. Quantum stoplights would turn to be deterministic after all.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baggott|first1=Jim E.|title=Beyond Measure: Modern Physics, Philosophy, and the Meaning of Quantum Theory|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, New York|isbn=0-19-852536-2|oclc=52486237|page=203|chapter=Complementarity and Entanglement|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVdjwsqrgz8C&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=scientific+consensus+determinism+bell+theorem&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4v8PUaL5MarK0QWk8oCwBw&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=scientific%20consensus%20determinism%20bell%20theorem&amp;f=false|quote=So, was Einstein wrong? In the sense that the EPR paper argued in favour of an objective reality for each quantum particle in an entangled pair independent of the other and of the measuring device, the answer must be yes. But if we take a wider view and ask instead if Einstein was wrong to hold to the realist's belief that the physics of the universe should be objective and deterministic, we must acknowledge that we cannot answer such a question. It is in the nature of theoretical science that there can be no such thing as certainty. A theory is only 'true' for as long as the majority of the scientific community maintain a consensus view that the theory is the one best able to explain the observations. And the story of quantum theory is not over yet.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adequate determinism (see [[Determinism#Varieties|Varieties]], above) is the reason that Stephen Hawking calls [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|Libertarian free will]] "just an illusion".&lt;ref name="GDesign"/&gt; see [[Free will]] for further discussions on this topic.

====Other matters of quantum determinism====
{{essay|section|date=November 2017}}
{{unsourced section|date=August 2018}}
[[File:HEUraniumC.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Chaotic radioactivity is the next explanatory challenge for physicists supporting determinism.]]
All uranium found on earth is thought to have been synthesized during a [[supernova]] explosion that occurred roughly 5 billion years ago. Even before the laws of quantum mechanics were developed to their present level, the [[radioactivity]] of such elements has posed a challenge to determinism due to its unpredictability. One gram of [[uranium-238]], a commonly occurring radioactive substance, contains some 2.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; atoms. Each of these atoms are identical and indistinguishable according to all tests known to modern science. Yet about 12600 times a second, one of the atoms in that gram will decay, giving off an [[alpha particle]]. The challenge for determinism is to explain why and when decay occurs, since it does not seem to depend on external stimulus. Indeed, no extant theory of physics makes [[testable]] predictions of exactly when any given atom will decay. At best scientists can discover determined probabilities in the form of the element's [[half life]].

The time dependent [[Schrödinger equation]] gives the first time [[derivative]] of the [[quantum state]]. That is, it explicitly and uniquely predicts the development of the [[wave function]] with time.
::&lt;math&gt;i\hbar\frac{\partial\psi(x,t)}{\partial t} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2\psi(x,t)}{\partial x^2}+V(x)\psi&lt;/math&gt;
So if the wave function itself is reality (rather than probability of classical coordinates), then the unitary evolution of the wave function in quantum mechanics, can be said to be deterministic. But the unitary evolution of the wave function is not the entirety of quantum mechanics.

Asserting that quantum mechanics is deterministic by treating the wave function itself as reality might be thought to imply a [[Universal wavefunction|single wave function for the entire universe]], starting at the origin of the universe. Such a "wave function of everything" would carry the probabilities of not just the world we know, but every other possible world that could have evolved. For example, large voids in the distributions of [[galaxy|galaxies]] are believed by many cosmologists to have originated in quantum fluctuations during the big bang. (''See'' [[cosmic inflation]], [[primordial fluctuations]] and [[large-scale structure of the cosmos]].)

However, neither the posited reality nor the proven and extraordinary accuracy of the wave function and quantum mechanics at small scales can imply or reasonably suggest the existence of a single wave function for the entire universe. Quantum mechanics breaks down wherever gravity becomes significant, because nothing in the wave function, or in quantum mechanics, predicts anything at all about gravity. And this is obviously of great importance on larger scales.

Gravity is thought of as a large-scale force, with a longer reach than any other. But gravity becomes significant even at masses that are tiny compared to the mass of the universe.

A wave function the size of the universe might successfully model a universe with no gravity. Our universe, with gravity, is vastly different from what quantum mechanics alone predicts. To forget this is a colossal error.

[[Objective collapse theory|Objective collapse theories]], which involve a dynamic (and non-deterministic) collapse of the wave function (e.g. [[Ghirardi–Rimini–Weber theory]], [[Penrose interpretation]], or [[causal fermion system]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s) avoid these absurdities. The theory of [[causal fermion system]]s for example, is able to unify [[quantum mechanics]], [[general relativity]] and [[quantum field theory]], via a more fundamental theory that is non-linear, but gives rise to the linear behaviour of the wave function and also gives rise to the non-linear, non-deterministic, wave-function collapse. These theories suggest that a deeper understanding of the theory underlying quantum mechanics shows the universe is indeed non-deterministic at a fundamental level.

Some New Age believers engage in travel to locations they consider important according to their beliefs; for example, [[Stonehenge]] is a popular destination among New Age seekers.&lt;ref name=hetherington&gt;{{cite book|title=New Age Travellers: Vanloads of Uproarious Humanity |first=Kevin |last=Hetherington |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |pages=143|year=2000|isbn=0304339784}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Macdonald &gt;{{cite book|title=Theorizing Museums: Representing Identity and Diversity in a Changing World|first=Sharon |last=Macdonald|author2=Gordon Fyfe |publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=1996|isbn=0631201513|pages=156,164–6,171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of Earth mysteries can be traced back to two 17th-century [[antiquarians]]: [[John Aubrey]] and [[William Stukeley]], who both believed that [[Stonehenge]] was associated with the [[druids]]. Stukeley mixed together ancient [[monuments]] and [[mythology]] towards an "idealized vision" of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzmwsF-O3fIC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=%22John+Aubrey%22+earth+mysteries&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fxL0TcO2GI618QOhnNyPBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDwQuwUwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22John+Aubrey%22+earth+mysteries&amp;f=false|title=The Cultures of Celebrations|first1=Ray Broadus|last1=Browne|first2=Michael T.|last2=Marsden|date=31 December 1994|publisher=Popular Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ley lines" were postulated by  [[Alfred Watkins]] in 1921 at a presentation at the [[Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club]], later published in ''Early British Trackways'' (1922) and ''The Old Straight Track'' (1925). Watkins formed the ''Old Straight Track Club'' in 1927, which was active until 1935 but became defunct during the World War II period.{{Citation needed|reason=Mention of organization becoming defunct, but no date or source are provided|date=February 2017}}

A revival of interest in the topic began in the 1960s, now associated with [[neopagan]] currents like [[Wicca]], and with [[ufology]]. Watkins' Straight Track Club was revived in 1962 by [[Philip Heselton]] and others as the Ley Hunters' Club. The new club's journal ''The Ley Hunter'' was issued from 1965 to 1970, subtitled "the Magazine of Earth Mysteries".{{Citation needed|reason=Reference to a journal and its content, without sources or external links|date=February 2017}}

British writer John Ivimy wrote a book in 1975 called ''The Sphinx and the Megaliths'' in which he linked the Egyptian [[Sphinx]] to the British [[Stonehenge]] and other [[megalith|megalithic structures]] claiming they were all built by a group of "elite trained" people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ex3FSCaY_4C&amp;pg=PA548&amp;dq=John+Ivimy+megaliths&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SiH1TaCLO5C38QO8q5yzBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDUQuwUwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=John+Ivimy+megaliths&amp;f=false|title=New Scientist|first=Reed Business|last=Information|date=29 August 1974|publisher=Reed Business Information|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Age boom]] of the 1980s expanded the scope of the "Earth mysteries" field beyond the British landscape, and Earth mysteries as a "New Age invented tradition" by the 1990s could include the study of ancient sites and landscapes (including [[archaeology]], [[archaeoastronomy]], and [[ley lines]]), Chinese [[geomancy]] or [[feng shui]], western magical concepts of [[gematria]], and [[dowsing]].&lt;ref name=macdonald&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.anthrosource.net/Abstract.aspx?issn=1053-4202&amp;volume=6&amp;issue=4&amp;doubleissueno=0&amp;article=237261&amp;suppno=0&amp;jstor=False| journal=Anthropology of Consciousness |volume= 6| issue = 4. |date=December 1995 |pages=31–45|title=Inventing Traditions for the New Age: A Case Study of the Earth Energy Tradition |author=JEFFERY L. MACDONALD|doi=10.1525/ac.1995.6.4.31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An important writer combining these fields during the 1970s to 2000s was [[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]]. Michell's book ''The View Over Atlantis'' mixed [[ley lines]] with [[folklore]] and [[archeology]]; these ideas became popularised as "earth mysteries".&lt;ref&gt;Danny Sullivan, Ley Lines: The Greatest Landscape Mystery, Publisher Green Magic, 2005, p. 11 {{ISBN|0954296346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other 1980s authors on the subject of Earth mysteries include [[Paul Devereux]] and [[Nigel Pennick]].&lt;ref&gt;Caitlin Matthews, John Matthews, Walkers Between the Worlds: The Western Mysteries from Shaman to Magus, Publisher: Inner Traditions, 2004, p. 55 {{ISBN|9780892810918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related ideas include the "[[landscape archaeology]]" advocated by German author Kurt Derungs from about 1990, and the wider field of "[[Forteana]]", a term taken to include [[paranormal]] phenomena more generally.{{Citation needed|reason=Assertion of connection to [[Forteana]], which makes no references to either archaelogy or paranormal locations. |date=February 2017}}

==Reception==

Proponents consider the Earth mysteries to be "[[sacred]]" and "[[Mythopoeic thought|mythopoeic]]" rather than scientific.&lt;ref name=ivakhiv/&gt; The ley lines idea has been generally ignored by the academic establishment in the field of archaeology.&lt;ref name=ivakhiv/&gt; The work of researchers who support the paranormal aspects of Earth mysteries have been extensively criticized by "professional debunkers" such as [[James Randi]], [[Martin Gardner]], and the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal ([[CSICOP]]).&lt;ref name=ivakhiv/&gt;

The Earth mysteries movement in Great Britain embraced the term "ritual landscapes" that was used in British archaeology starting in the 1980s, with regards to "sacred" locations apparently used for mainly ceremonial purposes in the [[Neolithic British Isles|Neolithic]] and the early [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]]; the concept has been both adopted and criticized in the field of academic archaeology.&lt;ref name= Robb&gt;{{cite journal|title=The 'ritual landscape' concept in archaeology: a heritage construction| url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a769326307~db=all |author=John G.

{{see also|Mizrach}}
The '''Eastern Wall''' is an ancient structure in [[Jerusalem]] that is both part of the eastern side of the city [[Walls of Jerusalem|wall of Jerusalem]] and the eastern wall of the ancient [[Temple Mount]].

The Eastern Wall is the oldest of the four visible walls of the Temple Mount; the Northern, [[Western Wall|Western]] and [[Southern Wall]]s date from the period of [[Herod the Great]], who expanded the area of the Temple Mount to the north, west and south.  Older walls on these sides are presumed to survive underground.  The Eastern Wall now visible was built in at least four stages, during the reign of [[Hezekiah]], during the time of [[Zerubbabel]], in the [[Hasmonean]] period and in the [[Herodian]] period.  Repairs and major renovations were made in later periods.  Major renovations to the [[Golden Gate (Jerusalem)|Golden Gate]] were made in the [[Umayyad]] period.

==History of construction==

===First Temple period===

Architectural archaeologist [[Leen Ritmeyer]] identifies specific courses of visible [[ashlars]] located on to the northern and south of the [[Golden Gate (Jerusalem)|Golden Gate]] as Judean Iron Age in style, dating them to the construction of this wall by [[King Hezekiah]].  More such stones are supposed to survive underground.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt;&lt;ref name=ShanksHouse/&gt;  According to [[Hershel Shanks]], "most scholars," think that Ritmeyer is "correct."&lt;ref name=ShanksHouse/&gt;

Ritmeyer has pointed out that the [[Dome of the Rock]] is seated on a square platform atop the Temple Mount, the sides of which, defined by short flights of steps, are square and parallel to the modern walls of the Mount with one exception: the western steps deviate from parallel.  Moreover, the bottom step on the western side of the Dome of the Rock platform is composed of a single line of distinctively large and "beautifully polished" ashlars.&lt;ref name=ShanksHouse&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jerusalem, an Archaeological Biography|first=Hershel|last=Shanks|publisher=Random House|year=1995|pages=47–65|isbn=978-0-679-44526-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Ritmeyer, the measurements given in the [[Mishna]], tractate Middot, "The Temple Mount measured 500 cubits by 500 cubits," can be traced on the modern Temple Mount, with this step the outline of the western side of the square and the Eastern Wall the eastern side.&lt;ref name=ShanksHouse/&gt;  The "precise" measurement of an ancient Judean royal [[cubit]], 20.67 inches, outlines these landmarks area exactly.&lt;ref name=ShanksHouse/&gt; The northern edge of the ancient square was demarcated by [[Charles Warren]], the last archaeologist permitted by the local [[waqf]] to explore the underground areas of the Mount, in his{{clarify |date=July 2017 |reason=word(s) missing?}} the underground structure he labeled as No. 29 in surveys he carried out in the 1860s.  The southern side of the 500 cubit ancient platform square is marked by he the so-called "Straight Joint," a visible bend in the eastern wall.&lt;ref name=ShanksHouse/&gt;&lt;ref name=RitmeyerOriginal&gt;Leen Ritmeyer, “Locating the Original Temple Mount,” BAR, March/April 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ritmeyer proposes that this 500 cubit walled square was constructed by King Hezekiah c. 700 BCE to expand the flat area in which the faithful could gather at the Solomonic-era Temple.  The [[Foundation Stone]] around which is the ancient Jewish Temple was built and which is now sheltered under the Dome of the Rock, is a natural rock outcrop at the highest point of a [[Mount Moriah]]; the natural contour of the land fell away steeply on all sides, although on the eastern side the natural contour formed a flat plateau before falling sharply to the [[Kidron Valley]] along the line where the Eastern Wall stands.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount&gt;Leen Ritmeyer, Kathleen Ritmeyer, ''Jerusalem; The Temple Mount,'' Carta, Jerusalem, 2015, {{ISBN|9789652208552}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Straight Joint" where the wall bends very slightly, demarcating the line between the Hezekiahan wall and the Hasmonean extension, is marked by a round column protruding from the wall near the top.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt;

===Hasmonean expansion===

The [[Hasmonean dynasty]] expanded the 500 cubit Temple platform toward the south; distinctively Hasmonean ashlars are visible in the Eastern Wall.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt; The seam between the Hasmonean and Herodian extensions of the wall is visible as a vertical row of ashlars 32 meters north of the southeast corner.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt;

===Herodian expansion===
King Herod expanded the Temple Mount still further toward the south; distinctively Herodian ashlars are visible in the Eastern Wall, in the last  stretch before the southeastern corner.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt;

==Gates in the Eastern Wall==
[[File:Golden Gate Jerusalem 2009.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Golden Gate]]
{{main article|Golden Gate (Jerusalem)}}
The magnificent Muslim period Golden Gate (sealed) replaced the ancient Golden Gate. The present gate is understood to have been constructed during the [[Umayyad]] period atop the ancient footings.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt;

==Muslim cemetery==

There is a Muslim cemetery along the southern stretch of the Eastern Wall. A path through the cemetery and parallel to the wall lies atop the ancient city wall, explored by Charles Warren in excavations since covered over, which once lay just outside the Eastern Wall of the Temple Mount.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt;

In [[physics]] and [[thermodynamics]], an '''equation of state''' is a [[thermodynamic equations|thermodynamic equation]] relating [[state variable]]s which describe the state of matter under a given set of physical conditions, such as [[pressure]], [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]], [[temperature]] ('''PVT'''), or [[internal energy]].&lt;ref name="Perrot" &gt;{{cite book | author=Perrot, Pierre | title=A to Z of Thermodynamics | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1998 | isbn=978-0-19-856552-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equations of state are useful in describing the properties of [[fluid]]s, mixtures of fluids, [[solid]]s, and the interior of [[star]]s.
{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[Thermodynamic system|Systems]]}}

==Overview==
The most prominent use of an equation of state is to correlate densities of gases and liquids to temperatures and pressures. One of the simplest equations of state for this purpose is the [[ideal gas law]], which is roughly accurate for weakly polar gases at low pressures and moderate temperatures. However, this equation becomes increasingly inaccurate at higher pressures and lower temperatures, and fails to predict condensation from a gas to a liquid. Therefore, a number of more accurate equations of state have been developed for gases and liquids. At present, there is no single equation of state that accurately predicts the properties of all substances under all conditions.

Another common use is in modeling the interior of stars, including [[neutron star]]s, dense matter ([[quark–gluon plasma]]s) and radiation fields. A related concept is the [[perfect fluid]] [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state used in cosmology]].

Equations of state can also describe solids, including the transition of solids from one crystalline state to another.

In a practical context, equations of state are instrumental for PVT calculations in [[process engineering]] problems, such as petroleum gas/liquid equilibrium calculations. A successful PVT model based on a fitted equation of state can be helpful to determine the state of the flow regime, the parameters for handling the [[reservoir fluids]], and pipe sizing.

== Historical ==

=== Boyle's law (1662) ===
Boyle's Law was perhaps the first expression of an equation of state.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} In 1662, the Irish physicist and chemist [[Robert Boyle]] performed a series of experiments employing a J-shaped glass tube, which was sealed on one end. [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] was added to the tube, trapping a fixed quantity of air in the short, sealed end of the tube. Then the volume of gas was measured as additional mercury was added to the tube. The pressure of the gas could be determined by the difference between the mercury level in the short end of the tube and that in the long, open end. Through these experiments, Boyle noted that the gas volume varied inversely with the pressure. In mathematical form, this can be stated as:

:&lt;math&gt; pV = \mathrm{constant}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &lt;!--this V doesn't have to be molar volume--&gt;

The above relationship has also been attributed to [[Edme Mariotte]] and is sometimes referred to as Mariotte's law. However, Mariotte's work was not published until 1676.

=== Charles's law or Law of Charles and Gay-Lussac (1787) ===
In 1787 the French physicist [[Jacques Charles]] found that oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and air expand to roughly the same extent over the same 80-kelvin interval. Later, in 1802, [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] published results of similar experiments, indicating a linear relationship between volume and temperature:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Dalton's law of partial pressures (1801) ===
[[Dalton's Law]] of partial pressure states that the pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the pressures of all of the constituent gases alone.

Mathematically, this can be represented for ''n'' species as:

::&lt;math&gt;
p_\text{total} = p_1+p_2+\cdots+p_n = p_\text{total} = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i.
&lt;/math&gt;

=== The ideal gas law (1834) ===
In 1834, [[Émile Clapeyron]] combined Boyle's Law and Charles' law into the first statement of the ''[[ideal gas law]]''. Initially, the law was formulated as ''pV&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''R''(''T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' + 267) (with temperature expressed in degrees Celsius), where ''R'' is the [[gas constant]]. However, later work revealed that the number should actually be closer to 273.2, and then the Celsius scale was defined with 0{{nbsp}}°C = 273.15{{nbsp}}K, giving:

:&lt;math&gt;pV_m = R \left(T_C + 273.15\ {}^\circ\text{C}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Van der Waals equation of state (1873) ===
In 1873, [[J. D. van der Waals]] introduced the first [[van der Waals equation|equation of state]] derived by the assumption of a finite volume occupied by the constituent molecules.&lt;ref name="van der Waals" &gt;{{cite book |author1=van der Waals |author2=J. D. | title=On the Continuity of the Gaseous and Liquid States (doctoral dissertation) | publisher=Universiteit Leiden | year=1873}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His new formula revolutionized the study of equations of state, and was most famously continued via the [[Redlich–Kwong equation of state]] and the [[#Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong|Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong]].

== General form of an equation of state ==
For a given amount of substance contained in a system, the temperature, volume, and pressure are not independent quantities; they are connected by a relationship of the general form

:&lt;math&gt;f(p, V, T) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

An equation used to model this relationship is called an equation of state. In the following sections major equations of state are described, and the variables used here are defined as follows. Any consistent set of units may be used, although [[International System of Units|SI]] units are preferred. [[Thermodynamic temperature|Absolute temperature]] refers to use of the [[Kelvin]] (K) or [[Rankine scale|Rankine]] (°R) temperature scales, with zero being absolute zero.

:&lt;math&gt;\ p&lt;/math&gt;, pressure (absolute)
:&lt;math&gt;\ V&lt;/math&gt;, volume
:&lt;math&gt;\ n&lt;/math&gt;, number of moles of a substance
:&lt;math&gt;\ V_m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{V}{n}&lt;/math&gt;, '''[[molar volume]]''', the volume of 1 mole of gas or liquid
:&lt;math&gt;\ T&lt;/math&gt;, [[thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]]
:&lt;math&gt;\ R&lt;/math&gt;, [[gas constant|ideal gas constant]] ≈ 8.3144621{{nbsp}}J/mol·K
:&lt;math&gt;\ p_c&lt;/math&gt;, pressure at the critical point
:&lt;math&gt;\ V_c&lt;/math&gt;, molar volume at the critical point
:&lt;math&gt;\ T_c&lt;/math&gt;, absolute temperature at the critical point

== Classical ideal gas law ==
The classical [[ideal gas law]] may be written

:&lt;math&gt;pV = nRT.&lt;/math&gt;

In the form shown above, the equation of state is thus

:&lt;math&gt;f(p, V, T) = pV - nRT = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

If the [[Perfect gas|calorically perfect]] gas approximation is used, then the ideal gas law may also be expressed as follows

:&lt;math&gt;p = \rho(\gamma - 1)e&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;  is the density, &lt;math&gt;\gamma = C_p/C_v&lt;/math&gt; is the adiabatic index ([[heat capacity ratio|ratio of specific heats]]), &lt;math&gt;e = C_v T&lt;/math&gt; is the internal energy per unit mass (the "specific internal energy"), &lt;math&gt;C_v&lt;/math&gt; is the specific heat at constant volume, and &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; is the specific heat at constant pressure.

== Cubic equations of state ==
Cubic equations of state are called such because they can be rewritten as a [[cubic function]] of V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Van der Waals equation of state ===
The [[Van der Waals equation]] of state may be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(p + \frac{a}{V_m^2}\right)\left(V_m - b\right) = RT&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V_m&lt;/math&gt; is [[molar volume]]. The substance-specific constants &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated from the [[critical properties]] &lt;math&gt;p_c, T_c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_c&lt;/math&gt; (noting that &lt;math&gt;V_c&lt;/math&gt; is the molar volume at the critical point) as:
:&lt;math&gt;a = 3p_c\, V_c^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{V_c}{3}.&lt;/math&gt;

Also written as
:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{27(R\,T_c)^2}{64p_c}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{R\,T_c}{8p_c}.&lt;/math&gt;

Proposed in 1873, the van der Waals equation of state was one of the first to perform markedly better than the ideal gas law. In this landmark equation &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is called the attraction parameter and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; the repulsion parameter or the effective molecular volume. While the equation is definitely superior to the ideal gas law and does predict the formation of a liquid phase, the agreement with experimental data is limited for conditions where the liquid forms. While the van der Waals equation is commonly referenced in text-books and papers for historical reasons, it is now obsolete. Other modern equations of only slightly greater complexity are much more accurate.

The van der Waals equation may be considered as the ideal gas law, "improved" due to two independent reasons:
# Molecules are thought as particles with volume, not material points. Thus &lt;math&gt;V_m&lt;/math&gt; cannot be too little, less than some constant. So we get (&lt;math&gt;V_m - b&lt;/math&gt;) instead of &lt;math&gt;V_m&lt;/math&gt;.
# While ideal gas molecules do not interact, we consider molecules attracting others within a distance of several molecules' radii. It makes no effect inside the material, but surface molecules are attracted into the material from the surface. We see this as diminishing of pressure on the outer shell (which is used in the ideal gas law), so we write (&lt;math&gt;p +&lt;/math&gt; something) instead of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. To evaluate this ‘something’, let's examine an additional force acting on an element of gas surface. While the force acting on each surface molecule is ~&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, the force acting on the whole element is ~&lt;math&gt;\rho^2&lt;/math&gt;~&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{V_m^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

With the reduced state variables, i.e. V&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;=V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;=P/P&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;=T/T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, the reduced form of the Van der Waals equation can be formulated:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(P_r + \frac{3}{V_r^2}\right)\left(3V_r - 1\right) = 8T_r&lt;/math&gt;

The benefit of this form is that for given T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, the reduced volume of the liquid and gas can be calculated directly using [[Cubic function#Cardano's method|Cardano's method]] for the reduced cubic form:

:&lt;math&gt;V_r^3 - \left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{8T_r}{3P_r}\right)V_r^2 + \frac{3V_r}{P_r} - \frac{1}{P_r} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

For P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;1 and T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;1, the system is in a state of vapor–liquid equilibrium. The reduced cubic equation of state yields in that case 3 solutions. The largest and the lowest solution are the gas and liquid reduced volume.

=== Redlich-Kwong equation of state ===
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  p &amp;= \frac{R\,T}{V_m - b} - \frac{a}{\sqrt{T}\,V_m\left(V_m + b\right)} \\[3pt]
  a &amp;\approx 0.42748\frac{R^2\,T_c^\frac{5}{2}}{p_c} \\[3pt]
  b &amp;\approx 0.08664\frac{R\,T_c}{p_c}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Introduced in 1949, the [[Redlich-Kwong equation of state]] was a considerable improvement over other equations of the time. It is still of interest primarily due to its relatively simple form. While superior to the van der Waals equation of state, it performs poorly with respect to the liquid phase and thus cannot be used for accurately calculating [[vapor–liquid equilibria]]. However, it can be used in conjunction with separate liquid-phase correlations for this purpose.

The Redlich-Kwong equation is adequate for calculation of gas phase properties when the ratio of the pressure to the [[critical properties|critical pressure]] (reduced pressure) is less than about one-half of the ratio of the temperature to the [[critical properties|critical temperature]] (reduced temperature):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{p_c} &lt; \frac{T}{2T_c}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong ===
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{R\,T}{V_m-b} - \frac{a\,\alpha}{V_m\left(V_m+b\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{0.42747\,R^2\,T_c^2}{P_c}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{0.08664\,R\,T_c}{P_c}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \left(1 + \left(0.48508 + 1.55171\,\omega - 0.15613\,\omega^2\right) \left(1-T_r^{\,0.5}\right)\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T_r = \frac{T}{T_c}&lt;/math&gt;

Where ω is the [[acentric factor]] for the species.

This formulation for &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is due to Graboski and Daubert.  The original formulation from Soave is:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \left(1 + \left(0.480 + 1.574\,\omega - 0.176\,\omega^2\right) \left(1-T_r^{\,0.5}\right)\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

for hydrogen:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = 1.202 \exp\left(-0.30288\,T_r\right).&lt;/math&gt;

We can also write it in the polynomial form, with:

:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{a\,\alpha\,P}{R^2\,T^2}&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{b\,P}{R\,T}&lt;/math&gt;
then we have:
:&lt;math&gt;0 = Z^3-Z^2+Z\left(A-B-B^2\right)-AB \;&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[universal gas constant]] and Z=PV/(RT) is the [[compressibility factor]].

In 1972 G. Soave&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/0009-2509(72)80096-4|title = Equilibrium constants from a modified Redlich-Kwong equation of state| journal=Chemical Engineering Science| volume=27| issue=6| pages=1197–1203|year = 1972|last1 = Soave|first1 = Giorgio}}&lt;/ref&gt; replaced the 1/{{radic|''T''}} term of the Redlich-Kwong equation with a function α(T,ω) involving the temperature and the [[acentric factor]] (the resulting equation is also known as the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state; SRK EOS). The α function was devised to fit the vapor pressure data of hydrocarbons and the equation does fairly well for these materials.

Note especially that this replacement changes the definition of ''a'' slightly, as the &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; is now to the second power.

=== Volume translation of Peneloux et alios ===
The SRK EOS may be written as
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{R\,T}{V_{m,\text{SRK}} - b} - \frac{a}{V_{m,\text{SRK}} \left(V_{m,\text{SRK}} + b\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    a &amp;= a_c\, \alpha \\
  a_c &amp;\approx 0.42747\frac{R^2\,T_c^2}{P_c} \\
    b &amp;\approx 0.08664\frac{R\,T_c}{P_c}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and other parts of the SRK EOS is defined in the SRK EOS section.

A downside of the SRK EOS, and other cubic EOS, is that the liquid molar volume is significantly less accurate than the gas molar volume. Peneloux et alios (1982)&lt;ref name="Peneloux1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peneloux|first1=A.|last2=Rauzy|first2=E.|last3=Freze|first3=R.|year=1982|title= A Consistent Correction for Redlich-Kwong-Soave Volumes|journal= Fluid Phase Equilibria|volume=8|issue=1982|pages=7–23|doi=10.1016/0378-3812(82)80002-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a simple correction for this by introducing a volume translation

:&lt;math&gt;V_{m,\text{SRK}} = V_m + c&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is an additional fluid component parameter that translate the molar volume slightly. On the liquid branch of the EOS, a small change in molar volume corresponds to a large change in pressure. On the gas branch of the EOS, a small change in molar volume corresponds to a much smaller change in pressure than for the liquid branch. Thus, the perturbation of the molar gas volume is small. Unfortunately, there are two versions that occur in science and industry.

In the first version only &lt;math&gt;V_{m,\text{SRK}}&lt;/math&gt; is translated,&lt;ref name="Soave1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soave|first1=G.|last2=Fermeglia|first2=M.|year=1990|title= On the Application of Cubic Equation of State to Synthetic High-Pressure VLE Measurements|journal= Fluid Phase Equilibria|volume=60|issue=1990|pages=261–271|doi=10.1016/0378-3812(90)85056-G}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Zeberg2001"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Zéberg-Mikkelsen|first1=C.K.|year=2001|title=Viscosity study of hydrocarbon fluids at reservoir conditions - modeling and measurements|journal=Ph.D. Thesis at the Technical University of Denmark.

:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{R\,T}{V_m + c - b} - \frac{a}{\left(V_m + c\right) \left(V_m + c + b\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

In the second version both &lt;math&gt;V_{m,\text{SRK}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_\text{SRK}&lt;/math&gt; are translated, or the translation of &lt;math&gt;V_{m,\text{SRK}}&lt;/math&gt; is followed by a renaming of the composite parameter {{nowrap|b − c}}.&lt;ref name="Pedersen1989"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Pedersen|first1=K.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  b_\text{SRK} &amp;= b + c \quad \text{or} \quad b - c \curvearrowright b \\
             p &amp;= \frac{R\,T}{V_m - b} - \frac{a}{\left(V_m + c\right) \left(V_m + 2c + b\right)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The c-parameter of a fluid mixture is calculated by
:&lt;math&gt;c = \sum_{i=1}^n z_i c_i&lt;/math&gt;

The c-parameter of the individual fluid components in a petroleum gas and oil can be estimated by the correlation

:&lt;math&gt;c_i \approx 0.40768\ \frac{RT_{ci}}{P_{ci}} \left(0.29441 - Z_{\text{RA},i}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where the Rackett compressibility factor &lt;math&gt;Z_{text{RA},i}&lt;/math&gt; can be estimated by

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{RA},i} \approx 0.29056 - 0.08775\ \omega_i&lt;/math&gt;

A nice feature with the volume translation method of Peneloux et alios (1982) is that it does not affect the vapor-liquid equilibrium calculations.&lt;ref name="Knudsen1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knudsen|first1=K.|year=1992|title=Phase Equilibria and Transport of Multiphase Systems|journal=Ph.D. Thesis at the Technical University of Denmark. Department of Chemical Engineering|issue=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that this method of volume translation can also be applied to other cubic EOSs if the c-parameter correlation is adjusted to match the selected EOS.

=== Peng–Robinson equation of state ===

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       p &amp;= \frac{R\,T}{V_m - b} - \frac{a\,\alpha}{V_m^2 + 2bV_m - b^2} \\[3pt]
       a &amp;\approx 0.45724 \frac{R^2\,T_c^2}{p_c} \\[3pt]
       b &amp;\approx 0.07780 \frac{R\,T_c}{p_c} \\[3pt]
  \alpha &amp;= \left(1 + \kappa \left(1 - T_r^\frac{1}{2}\right)\right)^2 \\[3pt]
  \kappa &amp;\approx 0.37464 + 1.54226\,\omega - 0.26992\,\omega^2 \\[3pt]
     T_r &amp;= \frac{T}{T_c}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In polynomial form:
:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{\alpha a p}{R^2\,T^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{bp}{RT}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z^3 - (1 - B)Z^2 + \left(A - 2B - 3B^2\right)Z - \left(AB - B^2 - B^3\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[acentric factor]] of the species, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[universal gas constant]] and &lt;math&gt;Z = PV/nRT&lt;/math&gt; is [[compressibility factor]].

The Peng–Robinson equation of state (PR EOS) was developed in 1976 at The [[University of Alberta]] by [[Ding Yu Peng|Ding-Yu Peng]] and Donald Robinson in order to satisfy the following goals:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A New Two-Constant Equation of State | journal = Industrial and Engineering Chemistry: Fundamentals | volume = 15 | year = 1976 | pages = 59–64 |author1=Peng, D. Y. |author2=Robinson, D. B. | doi = 10.1021/i160057a011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The parameters should be expressible in terms of the [[critical properties]] and the [[acentric factor]].
# The model should provide reasonable accuracy near the critical point, particularly for calculations of the [[compressibility factor]] and liquid density.
# The mixing rules should not employ more than a single binary interaction parameter, which should be independent of temperature, pressure and composition.
# The equation should be applicable to all calculations of all fluid properties in natural gas processes.

For the most part the Peng–Robinson equation exhibits performance similar to the Soave equation, although it is generally superior in predicting the liquid densities of many materials, especially nonpolar ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Essentials of Reservoir Engineering | volume = 1 | year = 2007 | pages = 151 | author = Pierre Donnez  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[departure function]]s of the Peng–Robinson equation are given on a separate article.

The analytic values of its characteristic constants are:

: &lt;math&gt;Z_c = \frac{1}{32} \left( 11 - 2\sqrt{7} \sinh(\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{asinh}(\frac{13}{7 \sqrt{7}})) \right) \approx 0.307401&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;b' = \frac{b}{V_{m,c}} = \frac{1}{3} \left( \sqrt{8} \sinh(\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{asinh}(\sqrt{8}) ) - 1 \right) \approx 0.253077 \approx \frac{0.07780}{Z_c} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{P_c V_{m,c}^2}{a\,b'} = \frac{3}{8} \left( 1 + \cosh(\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{acosh}(3) ) \right) \approx 0.816619 \approx \frac{Z_c^2}{0.45724 \, b'} &lt;/math&gt;

==={{anchor|prsv}}Peng–Robinson-Stryjek-Vera equations of state===

====PRSV1====
A modification to the attraction term in the Peng–Robinson equation of state published by Stryjek and Vera in 1986 (PRSV) significantly improved the model's accuracy by introducing an adjustable pure component parameter and by modifying the polynomial fit of the [[acentric factor]].&lt;ref name="PRSV1"&gt;{{cite journal | title = PRSV: An improved Peng–Robinson equation of state for pure compounds and mixtures | journal = The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering | volume = 64 | issue = 2 | year = 1986 | pages = 323–333 |author1=Stryjek, R.  |author2=Vera, J. H. | doi = 10.1002/cjce.5450640224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modification is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \kappa &amp;= \kappa_0 + \kappa_1 \left(1 + T_r^\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(0.7 - T_r\right) \\
  \kappa_0 &amp;= 0.378893+1.4897153\,\omega - 0.17131848\,\omega^2 + 0.0196554\,\omega^3
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\,\kappa_1&lt;/math&gt; is an adjustable pure component parameter.  Stryjek and Vera published pure component parameters for many compounds of industrial interest in their original journal article. At reduced temperatures above 0.7, they recommend to set &lt;math&gt;\,\kappa_1 = 0 &lt;/math&gt; and simply use &lt;math&gt;\kappa = \kappa_0 &lt;/math&gt;. For alcohols and water the value of &lt;math&gt;\,\kappa_1 &lt;/math&gt; may be used up to the critical temperature and set to zero at higher temperatures.&lt;ref name="PRSV1" /&gt;

====PRSV2====
A subsequent modification published in 1986 (PRSV2) further improved the model's accuracy by introducing two additional pure component parameters to the previous attraction term modification.&lt;ref name="PRSV2"&gt;{{cite journal | title = PRSV2: A cubic equation of state for accurate vapor—liquid equilibria calculations | journal = The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering | volume = 64 | issue = 5 | year = 1986 | pages = 820–826 |author1=Stryjek, R.  |author2=Vera, J. H. | doi = 10.1002/cjce.5450640516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modification is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \kappa &amp;= \kappa_0 + \left[\kappa_1 + \kappa_2\left(\kappa_3 - T_r\right)\left(1 - T_r^\frac{1}{2}\right)\right]\left(1 + T_r^\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(0.7 - T_r\right) \\
  \kappa_0 &amp;= 0.378893 + 1.4897153\,\omega - 0.17131848\,\omega^2 + 0.0196554\,\omega^3
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\,\kappa_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\,\kappa_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\,\kappa_3&lt;/math&gt; are adjustable pure component parameters.

PRSV2 is particularly advantageous for [[vapor–liquid equilibrium|VLE]] calculations.  While PRSV1 does offer an advantage over the Peng–Robinson model for describing thermodynamic behavior, it is still not accurate enough, in general, for phase equilibrium calculations.&lt;ref name="PRSV1" /&gt;  The highly non-linear behavior of phase-equilibrium calculation methods tends to amplify what would otherwise be acceptably small errors.  It is therefore recommended that PRSV2 be used for equilibrium calculations when applying these models to a design.  However, once the equilibrium state has been determined, the phase specific thermodynamic values at equilibrium may be determined by one of several simpler models with a reasonable degree of accuracy.&lt;ref name="PRSV2" /&gt;

One thing to note is that in the PRSV equation, the parameter fit is done in a particular temperature range which is usually below the critical temperature. Above the critical temperature, the PRSV alpha function tends to diverge and become arbitrarily large instead of tending towards 0. Because of this, alternate equations for alpha should be employed above the critical point. This is especially important for systems containing hydrogen which is often found at temperatures far above its critical point. Several alternate formulations have been proposed. Some well known ones are by Twu et all or by Mathias and Copeman.

=== Elliott, Suresh, Donohue equation of state ===
The Elliott, Suresh, and Donohue (ESD) equation of state was proposed in 1990.&lt;ref name="ESD" &gt;{{cite journal |author1=J. Richard, Jr. Elliott |author2=S. Jayaraman Suresh |author3=Marc D. Donohue | year=1990 | title=A Simple Equation of State for Nonspherical and Associating Molecules | journal=Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. |volume=29 | pages=1476–1485 | doi=10.1021/ie00103a057 | issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equation seeks to correct a shortcoming in the Peng–Robinson EOS in that there was an inaccuracy in the van der Waals repulsive term. The EOS accounts for the effect of the shape of a non-polar molecule and can be extended to polymers with the addition of an extra term (not shown). The EOS itself was developed through modeling computer simulations and should capture the essential physics of the size, shape, and hydrogen bonding.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p V_m}{RT}=Z=1 + Z^{\rm{rep}} + Z^{\rm{att}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;Z^{\rm{rep}} = \frac{4 c \eta}{1-1.9 \eta}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z^{\rm{att}} = -\frac{z_m q \eta Y}{1+ k_1 \eta Y}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a "shape factor", with &lt;math&gt;c=1&lt;/math&gt; for spherical molecules
:For non-spherical molecules, the following relation is suggested:

:&lt;math&gt;c=1+3.535\omega+0.533\omega^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[acentric factor]]

:The reduced number density &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\eta=\frac{v^* n}{V}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;v^*&lt;/math&gt; is the characteristic size parameter
:&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of molecules
:&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the container
The characteristic size parameter is related to the shape parameter &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; through
:&lt;math&gt;v^*=\frac{kT_c}{P_c}\Phi&lt;/math&gt;
where

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi=\frac{0.0312+0.087(c-1)+0.008(c-1)^2}{1.000+2.455(c-1)+0.732(c-1)^2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]].

Noting the relationships between Boltzmann's constant and the [[Universal gas constant]], and observing that the number of molecules can be expressed in terms of [[Avogadro's number]] and the [[molar mass]], the reduced number density &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in terms of the molar volume as

:&lt;math&gt;\eta=\frac{R T_c}{P_c}\Phi\frac{1}{V_m}.&lt;/math&gt;

The shape parameter &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; appearing in the Attraction term and the term &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are given by
:&lt;math&gt;q=1+k_3(c-1)&lt;/math&gt; (and is hence also equal to 1 for spherical molecules).

:&lt;math&gt;Y=\exp\left(\frac{\epsilon}{kT}\right) - k_2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the depth of the square-well potential and is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\epsilon}{k} =\frac{1.000+0.945(c-1)+0.134(c-1)^2}{1.023+2.225(c-1)+0.478(c-1)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z_m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_3&lt;/math&gt; are constants in the equation of state:
:&lt;math&gt;z_m = 9.49&lt;/math&gt; for spherical molecules (c=1)
:&lt;math&gt;k_1 = 1.7745&lt;/math&gt; for spherical molecules (c=1)
:&lt;math&gt;k_2 = 1.0617&lt;/math&gt; for spherical molecules (c=1)
:&lt;math&gt;k_3 = 1.90476.&lt;/math&gt;

The model can be extended to associating components and mixtures of nonassociating components. Details are in the paper by J.R. Elliott, Jr. ''et al.'' (1990).&lt;ref name="ESD"/&gt;

The Cubic-Plus-Association (CPA) equation of state combines the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation with an association term from Wertheim theory.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kontogeorgis|first1=Georgios M.|last2=Michelsen|first2=Michael L.|last3=Folas|first3=Georgios K.|last4=Derawi|first4=Samer|last5=von Solms|first5=Nicolas|last6=Stenby|first6=Erling H.|title=Ten Years with the CPA (Cubic-Plus-Association) Equation of State.

== Non-cubic equations of state ==

=== Dieterici equation of state ===
: &lt;math&gt;p(V - b) = RTe^{-\frac{a}{RTV}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' is associated with the interaction between molecules and ''b'' takes into account the finite size of the molecules, similar to the Van der Waals equation.

The reduced coordinates are:
: &lt;math&gt;T_c = \frac{a}{4Rb},\ p_c = \frac{a}{4b^2 e^2},\ V_c = 2b.&lt;/math&gt;

== Virial equations of state ==

=== Virial equation of state ===
{{main|Virial expansion}}
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{pV_m}{RT} = A + \frac{B}{V_m} + \frac{C}{V_m^2} + \frac{D}{V_m^3} + \dots&lt;/math&gt;

Although usually not the most convenient equation of state, the virial equation is important because it can be derived directly from [[statistical mechanics]]. This equation is also called the [[Kamerlingh Onnes]] equation. If appropriate assumptions are made about the mathematical form of intermolecular forces, theoretical expressions can be developed for each of the [[virial coefficient|coefficients]]. ''A'' is the first virial coefficient, which has a constant value of 1 and makes the statement that when volume is large, all fluids behave like ideal gases. The second virial coefficient ''B'' corresponds to interactions between pairs of molecules, ''C'' to triplets, and so on. Accuracy can be increased indefinitely by considering higher order terms.  The coefficients ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', etc. are functions of temperature only.

One of the most accurate equations of state is that from Benedict-Webb-Rubin-Starling&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Fluid Properties for Light Petroleum Systems |last=Starling |first=Kenneth E. |publisher=Gulf Publishing Company |year=1973 |page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; shown next. It was very close to a virial equation of state. If the exponential term in it is expanded to two Taylor terms, a virial equation can be derived:
:&lt;math&gt;p=\rho RT + \left(B_0 RT-A_0 - \frac{C_0}{T^2} + \frac{D_0}{T^3} - \frac{E_0}{T^4}\right) \rho^2 + \left(bRT-a-\frac{d}{T} + \frac{c}{T^2}\right) \rho^3 + \alpha\left(a+\frac{d}{T}\right) \rho^6 &lt;/math&gt;

Note that in this virial equation, the fourth and fifth virial terms are zero. The second virial coefficient is monotonically decreasing as temperature is lowered. The third virial coefficient is monotonically increasing as temperature is lowered.

=== The BWR equation of state ===
{{main|Benedict–Webb–Rubin equation}}
:&lt;math&gt;
  p = \rho RT +
      \left(B_0 RT - A_0 - \frac{C_0}{T^2} + \frac{D_0}{T^3} - \frac{E_0}{T^4}\right) \rho^2 +
      \left(bRT - a - \frac{d}{T}\right) \rho^3 +
      \alpha\left(a + \frac{d}{T}\right) \rho^6 +
      \frac{c\rho^3}{T^2}\left(1 + \gamma\rho^2\right)\exp\left(-\gamma\rho^2\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where
:''p'' is pressure
:''ρ'' is molar density

== SAFT equations of state ==
[[Statistical associating fluid theory]] (SAFT) equations of state use [[Statistical mechanics|statistical mechanical]] methods (in particular [[perturbation theory]]) to describe the interactions between molecules in a system.&lt;ref name="ChapmanGubbins1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chapman|first1=Walter G.|last2=Gubbins|first2=K.E.|last3=Jackson|first3=G.|last4=Radosz|first4=M.|title=SAFT: Equation-of-state solution model for associating fluids|journal=Fluid Phase Equilibria|date=1 December 1989|volume=52|year=1989|pages=31–38|doi=10.1016/0378-3812(89)80308-5 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378381289803085 |accessdate=31 August 2018 |language=en |issn=0378-3812}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a SAFT equation of state was first proposed by Chapman et al. in 1989,&lt;ref name="ChapmanGubbins1989" /&gt; but since then many different SAFT equations of state have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1063/1.473101|title = Statistical associating fluid theory for chain molecules with attractive potentials of variable range| journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics| volume=106| issue=10| pages=4168–4186|year = 1997|last1 = Gil-Villegas|first1 = Alejandro| last2=Galindo| first2=Amparo| last3=Whitehead| first3=Paul J.| last4=Mills| first4=Stuart J.| last5=Jackson| first5=George| last6=Burgess| first6=Andrew N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often SAFT equations represent molecules as collections of spherical particles that interact with one another.&lt;ref name="ChapmanGubbins1989" /&gt; One popular SAFT equation represents molecules as chains composed of spherical segments ([[PC-SAFT]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1021/ie0003887|title = Perturbed-Chain SAFT:  An Equation of State Based on a Perturbation Theory for Chain Molecules| journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research| volume=40| issue=4| pages=1244–1260|year = 2001|last1 = Gross|first1 = Joachim| last2=Sadowski| first2=Gabriele}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, SAFT equations give more accurate results than traditional cubic equations of state, especially for systems containing liquids or solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1021/ie010954d|title = Application of the Perturbed-Chain SAFT Equation of State to Associating Systems| journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research| volume=41| issue=22| pages=5510–5515|year = 2002|last1 = Gross|first1 = Joachim| last2=Sadowski| first2=Gabriele}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.fluid.2014.08.035|title = A modified continuous flow apparatus for gas solubility measurements at high pressure and temperature with camera system| journal=Fluid Phase Equilibria| volume=382| pages=150–157|year = 2014|last1 = Saajanlehto|first1 = Meri| last2=Uusi-Kyyny| first2=Petri| last3=Alopaeus| first3=Ville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multiparameter equations of state ==

=== Helmholtz Function form ===
Multiparameter equations of state (MEOS) can be used to represent pure fluids with high accuracy, in both the liquid and gaseous states. MEOS's represent the Helmholtz function of the fluid as the sum of ideal gas and residual terms. Both terms are explicit in reduced temperature and reduced density - thus:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{a(T, \rho)}{RT} = 
  \frac{a^o(T, \rho) + a^r(T, \rho)}{RT} =
  \alpha^o(\tau, \delta) + \alpha^r(\tau, \delta)
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: &lt;math&gt;\tau = \frac{T_r}{T}, \delta = \frac{\rho}{\rho_r}&lt;/math&gt;

The reduced density and temperature are typically, though not always, the critical values for the pure fluid.

Other thermodynamic functions can be derived from the MEOS by using appropriate derivatives of the Helmholtz function; hence, because integration of the MEOS is not required, there are few restrictions as to the functional form of the ideal or residual terms. Typical MEOS use upwards of 50 fluid specific parameters, but are able to represent the fluid's properties with high accuracy. MEOS are available currently for about 50 of the most common industrial fluids including refrigerants. Mixture models also exist.

== Other equations of state of interest ==

===Stiffened equation of state===

When considering water under very high pressures, in situations such as [[Underwater explosion|underwater nuclear explosions]], [[Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy|sonic shock lithotripsy]], and [[sonoluminescence]], the stiffened equation of state is often used:

:&lt;math&gt;p = \rho(\gamma - 1)e - \gamma p^0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the internal energy per unit mass, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is an empirically determined constant typically taken to be about 6.1, and &lt;math&gt;p^0&lt;/math&gt; is another constant, representing the molecular attraction between water molecules. The magnitude of the correction is about 2 gigapascals (20,000 atmospheres).

The equation is stated in this form because the speed of sound in water is given by &lt;math&gt;c^2 = \gamma\left(p + p^0\right)/\rho&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus water behaves as though it is an ideal gas that is ''already'' under about 20,000 atmospheres (2&amp;nbsp;GPa) pressure, and explains why water is commonly assumed to be incompressible: when the external pressure changes from 1 atmosphere to 2 atmospheres (100&amp;nbsp;kPa to 200&amp;nbsp;kPa), the water behaves as an ideal gas would when changing from 20,001 to 20,002 atmospheres (2000.1&amp;nbsp;MPa to 2000.2&amp;nbsp;MPa).

This equation mispredicts the [[specific heat capacity]] of water but few simple alternatives are available for severely nonisentropic processes such as strong shocks.

===Ultrarelativistic equation of state===

An [[ultrarelativistic fluid]] has equation of state

:&lt;math&gt;p = \rho_m c_s^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure, &lt;math&gt;\rho_m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass density, and &lt;math&gt;c_s&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of sound]].

===Ideal Bose equation of state===

The equation of state for an ideal [[Bose gas]] is

:&lt;math&gt;pV_m =
  RT~\frac{\text{Li}_{\alpha+1}(z)}{\zeta(\alpha)}
  \left(\frac{T}{T_c}\right)^\alpha
&lt;/math&gt;

where α is an exponent specific to the system (e.g. in the absence of a potential field, α = 3/2), ''z'' is exp(''μ''/''kT'') where ''μ'' is the [[chemical potential]], Li is the [[polylogarithm]], ζ is the [[Riemann zeta function]], and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; is the critical temperature at which a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] begins to form.

===Jones–Wilkins–Lee equation of state for explosives (JWL equation)===
The '''equation of state from Jones–Wilkins–Lee''' is used to describe the detonation products of explosives.

:&lt;math&gt;p = A \left( 1 - \frac{\omega}{R_1 V} \right) \exp(-R_1 V) + B \left( 1 - \frac{\omega}{R_2 V} \right) \exp\left(-R_2 V\right) + \frac{\omega e_0}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

The ratio &lt;math&gt; V = \rho_e / \rho &lt;/math&gt; is defined by using &lt;math&gt; \rho_e &lt;/math&gt; = density of the explosive (solid part) and &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; = density of the detonation products. The parameters &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; R_1 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; R_2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; are given by several references.&lt;ref name="Dobratz" &gt;{{Cite journal |author1=B.

Cletus Kiley taking over as president in 2006,&lt;ref name="kiley"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060408161719/http://www.usccb.org/comm/archives/2006/06-071.shtml|title=Father Kiley to Head The Faith &amp; Politics Institute|author=|date=8 April 2006|website=USCCB - (Office of Media Relations)|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; succeeded in 2011 by the Rev.

While many Democratic and Republican Congressional Representatives work with the organization, including those on its Congressional Advisory Board, Representative [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]], a former leader of the [[Civil rights movement]] in America, has played a special role in its programs, including its annual Civil Rights Pilgrimage to Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810103707/http://thecommongroundblog.com/2011/02/16/congressman-john-lewis-recieves-medal-of-freedom|title=Congressman John Lewis Recieves(sic) Medal of Freedom|author=|date=10 August 2011|website=The Common Ground Blog|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Institute was founded in 1991 to "provide bipartisan, bridge-building opportunities for political leaders to experience the spiritual power of conscience, courage, and compassion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114202005/http://www.nndb.com/org/014/000120651|title=Faith and Politics Institute|author=|date=14 November 2017|website=[[NNDB]]|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans for the group resulted from an early "reflection group" that included Rep. [[Glenn Poshard]], Ms. Anne Bartley, Rev. Joe Eldridge, and Rev. Doug Tanner. Convinced of the importance of such opportunities for reflection, Tanner founded the Institute in 1991 "with the hope of providing opportunities for meaningful interactions and experiences among those who lead and serve our nation",
Some of the Institute's earliest efforts were linked to the "Common Ground" program, providing opportunities for staffers and members to help rebuild churches burned by arsonists in the mid-1990s.

In 1997, the organization expanded its programs when then-President Rev. Doug Tanner persuaded Representative [[Amo Houghton]] and Representative John Lewis (D-GA) to serve as the co-chairmen of the group's Board of Directors.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104040605/http://www.faithandpolitics.org/staff_and_board|title=Staff and Board|author=|date=4 January 2012|website=The Faith &amp; Politics Institute|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their involvement brought in many additional members and leaders of Congress interested in dialogue across party, religious, racial, and ideological lines, creating a "spiritual community of men and women who seek a better way to do the people's business."&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

==Board and Advisors==
The Board consists primarily of lobbyists, Government Relations professionals, and lawyers specializing in Government Regulation practices, representing such companies as [[Akin Gump, LLC]], [[Alston &amp; Bird LLP]], [[American Airlines]], [[American Bridge Company|American Bridge]], [[American Values Network]], [[Arent Fox]], [[Aspen Institute]], [[Association of American Publishers]], [[A Capitol Fourth|Capital Concerts Inc.]], [[Coca-Cola Company]], [[Covidien]], [[Eleison LLC]], [[Escambia Enterprises]], [[Federal City Council]], [[Fluor Corporation]], [[Ford Motor Company]], [[General Motors]], [[Goldman Sachs Group]], [[Jewish Funds for Justice]], [[Alvin Radkowsky|Lightbridge Corporation]], [[Microsoft Corporation]], [[Moore Consulting]], [[National Association of Broadcasters]], [[National Democratic Institute]], [[Regions Financial]], [[The First Group]], [[The Memorial Foundation]], [[TwinLogic Strategies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Christina Wilkie | title=Lyft Prepares To Fight Ride Share Regulation By Hiring GOP-Linked Lobbyists | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/16/lyft-lobbying_n_5161322.html | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Health Group]], and [[Williams &amp; Jensen]], and others.&lt;ref name="leadership" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024103500/http://faithandpolitics.org:80/leadership/|title=Leadership|author=|date=24 October 2016|website=The Faith &amp; Politics Institute|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Board, the Institute includes a “Corporate Advisory Council” composed exclusively of Lobbyists and Government Relations professionals. The members are : Joyce Brayboy ([[The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.]]), Myra Dandridge ([[National Association of Broadcasters]]), Matt Gelman ([[Microsoft Corporation]]), Alison Jones ([[Ford Motor Company]]), Norma Kaehler ([[American Airlines]]), Janine Kellner ([[The Coca-Cola Company]]), David Marventano ([[Fluor Corporation]]), Melinda Maxfield ([[Williams &amp; Jensen PLLC]]), Chris Scribner ([[Regions Financial]]), Kyle Simmons ([[The First Group]]), Dan Turton ([[General Motors]]), Kimberly Woodard ([[The Memorial Foundation]])&lt;ref name="leadership"/&gt;

==Programs and activities==
Activities within these three broad areas include reflection groups, retreats, pilgrimages, and public forums.  The weekly reflection groups and occasional retreats are important opportunities seek to provide opportunities for men and women who work in the "fast-paced and charged atmosphere of Washington, D.C., to "connect their role with their greater calling as human beings." The public forums include lectures by well-known speakers "whose lives reflect moral courage in the political arena." The pilgrimages allow men and women from both houses of congress, along with staff members and special guests, to take part in trips that provide information, inspiration, and opportunities for reflection on the lessons to be learned from past struggles, such as the civil rights movement. The annual pilgrimage to Montgomery and Selma Alabama that includes a walk over the famous Edmund Pettus Bridge is an event led by Representative John Lewis, an early civil rights leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729220650/https://sites.google.com/a/faithandpolitics.org/11th-congressional-civil-rights-pilgrimage/|title=11th Congressional Civil Rights Pilgrimage|author=|date=29 July 2016|website=The Faith &amp; Politics Institute|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other special activities include:
*The Lewis-Houghton Leadership Awards: recognizing leaders "who have exhibited qualities of conscience, courage and compassion in their roles as public servants."  
* United States-South Africa Faith and Politics Initiative: In May 2003, The Faith &amp; Politics Institute provided program conceptualization, planning, and coordination for the Congressional visit (CODEL) to South Africa, led by Reps. Houghton and Lewis. This visit provided an opportunity to compare lessons learned from America's civil rights movement and South Africa's fight against [[apartheid]], and established links for future dialogue.
* Saint Joseph's Day Breakfast: an annual breakfast program, including a speaker and awards ceremony, on [[Saint Joseph's Day]]. Because [[Saint Joseph]] is recognized by many as the patron saint of the worker, the Institute's St. Joseph's Day breakfast was founded "to raise awareness of the spiritual and moral issues that affect economic life in America." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208162421/http://events.constantcontact.com/register/event?oeidk=a07e2sl4qal23b8940c|title=St. Joseph's Breakfast|author=|date=8 February 2011|website=[[Constant Contact]]|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Congressional Reception: Every other year, this reception acknowledges both those who have supported the Institute's efforts and those who have been inspired by its programs.&lt;ref name="programs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223212750/http://www.faithandpolitics.org/programs_activities|title=Programs and Activities|author=|date=23 December 2011|website=The Faith &amp; Politics Institute|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Faith &amp; Politics Institute just concluded its annual Congressional Pilgrimage to Alabama to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of "Bloody Sunday".  The Institute brought together an unprecedented number of Senators and Members of Congress in a bipartisan fashion to reflect on the Civil Rights struggle of the past.  There were over 100 lawmakers in attendance during the 3 day weekend including addresses and appearances by former President George W. Bush and President Obama in Selma, Alabama.

===Partnerships===
Through partnership efforts with other organizations, the Institute extends its reach by co-sponsoring special events that its basic missions. Some groups, like the [[Fetzer Institute]], partner with the Institute to support a wide variety of its programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927155517/http://www.fetzer.org/resources/resource-detail/?resource_id=2328|title=Congressional Civil Rights Pilgrimages|author=|date=27 September 2011|website=Fetzer Institute|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others focus on specific events, including:
*Congressional Conversations on Race: co-sponsored with [[Search for Common Ground]], and founded on a belief in the need for the nation's leaders to recognize the spiritual nature of our nation's historic racial wounds, and work together toward healing.&lt;ref name="cc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326011953/http://congressionalconversations.com/|title=Congressional Conversations|author=|date=26 March 2018|website=congressionalconversations.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150305013400/http://www.faithandpolitics.org/congressional-conversations-on-race/&lt;/ref&gt;
*Civil Rights Heroes: Buried but not forgotten: in partnership with Sewall-Belmont House, the District of Columbia, GLAAD, and the National Park Service, honored women and men buried in the Congressional Cemetery, who played key roles in advancing justice and equality for all. One of the men honored was Leonard Matlovich a [[Vietnam war]] veteran Tech Sergeant, who had spoken out against discrimination against gay and lesbian service personnel.
*Muslims in America: The Faith &amp; Politics Institute, along with the Newseum's Religious Freedom Education Project and Wesley Theological Seminary, hosted evening of storytelling and honest dialogue what it means to be Muslim-American in our contemporary context.

==Leadership==
The Reverend Doug Tanner was founder and first president of the organization. In 2006, Father Cletus Kiley, a priest of the Archdiocese of Chicago, at that time executive director of the Office of Priestly Life and Ministry of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), took over as president, with Tanner continuing to work as the group's "Senior Advisor."&lt;ref name="kiley"/&gt; The current president is the Rev. Mark J. Farr, previously the Senior Faith Director of the [[Points of Light Institute]].&lt;ref name="staff_and_board" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414035404/http://www.faithandpolitics.org/staff_and_board|title=Staff and Board|author=|date=14 April 2012|website=The Faith &amp; Politics Institute|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farr was selected for the position in January 2011 and officially began work as president on February 28, 2011.&lt;ref name="farr"/&gt;  Rob Liberatore, is the current Interim President and CEO while a national search is conducted for a new President.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9095">'''Geomathematics''' or '''Mathematical Geophysics''' is the application of [[mathematical]] intuition to solve problems in [[Geophysics]]. The most complicated problem in Geophysics is
the solution of the three dimensional inverse problem, where
observational constraints are used to infer physical properties.
The inverse procedure is much more sophisticated than the normal direct computation of what should be observed from a physical system.
The estimation procedure is often dubbed the inversion strategy (also called the [[inverse problem]]) as the procedure is intended to estimate from a set of observations the circumstances that produced them. The Inverse Process is thus the converse of the classical [[scientific method]].

== Applications ==

=== Terrestrial Tomography ===

An important research area that utilises inverse methods is
[[seismic tomography]], a technique for imaging the subsurface of the Earth using [[seismic waves]]. Traditionally seismic waves produced by [[earthquakes]] or anthropogenic seismic sources (e.g., explosives, marine air guns) were used. 

=== Crystallography ===
[[Crystallography]] is one of the traditional areas of [[geology]] that use [[mathematics]]. Crystallographers make use of [[linear algebra]] by using the [[Metric tensor|Metrical Matrix]]. The [[Metric tensor|Metrical Matrix]] uses the basis vectors of the [[Crystal structure|unit cell]] dimensions to find the volume of a unit cell, d-spacings, the angle between two planes, the angle between atoms, and the bond length.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Metrical Matrix in Teaching Mineralogy|last=Gibbs|first=G. V.|publisher=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=201–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller’s Index is also helpful in the application of the [[Metric tensor|Metrical Matrix]]. [[Bragg's law|Brag’s equation]] is also useful when using an [[electron microscope]] to be able to show relationship between light diffraction angles, wavelength, and the d-spacings within a sample.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Geophysics ===
[[Geophysics]] is one of the most [[Mathematics|math]] heavy disciplines of [[geology]]. There are many applications which include [[gravity]], [[Magnetism|magnetic]], [[Seismology|seismic]], [[Electricity|electric]], [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]], [[Resistivity logging|resistivity]], radioactivity, induced polarization, and [[well logging]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Geophysics-W-M-Telford/dp/0521339383|title=Applied Geophysics|last=Telford|first=W. M.|last2=Geldart|first2=L. P.|last3=Sheriff|first3=R. E.|date=1990-10-26|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=9780521339384|edition=2|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gravity and magnetic methods share similar characteristics because they’re measuring small changes in the gravitational field based on the density of the rocks in that area.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While similar [[Physical geodesy|gravity fields]] tend to be more uniform and smooth compared to [[magnetic field]]s. Gravity is used often for [[Hydrocarbon exploration|oil exploration]] and seismic can also be used, but it is often significantly more expensive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Seismic is used more than most geophysics techniques because of its ability to penetrate, its resolution, and its accuracy.

=== Geomorphology ===
Many applications of [[mathematics]] in [[geomorphology]] are related to water. In the [[Soil mechanics|soil]] aspect things like [[Darcy's law|Darcy’s law]], [[Stokes' law|Stoke’s law]], and [[Pore space in soil|porosity]] are used.
* [[Darcy's law|Darcy’s law]] is used when one has a saturated soil that is uniform to describe how [[Fluid dynamics|fluid flows]] through that medium.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Environmental-Physics-Daniel-Hillel/dp/0123486556/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494354093&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=soil+physics|title=Introduction to Environmental Soil Physics|last=Hillel|first=Daniel|date=2003-11-05|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|isbn=9780123486554|edition=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of work would fall under [[hydrogeology]].
* [[Stokes' law|Stoke’s law]] measures how quickly different sized particles will settle out of a fluid.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is used when doing [[Particle-size distribution|pipette analysis]] of soils to find the percentage sand vs silt vs clay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Soil-Properties-Testing-Measurement-Evaluation/dp/0136141234/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494354206&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=soil+properties|title=Soil Properties: Testing, Measurement, and Evaluation|last=Liu|first=Cheng|last2=Ph.D|first2=Jack Evett|date=2008-04-16|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9780136141235|edition=6|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; A potential error is it assumes perfectly spherical particles which don’t exist.
* [[Stream power]] is used to find the ability of a river to [[River incision|incise]] into the [[Stream bed|river bed]]. This is applicable to see where a river is likely to fail and change course or when looking at the damage of losing stream sediments on a river system (like downstream of a dam).
* [[Differential equation]]s can be used in multiple areas of [[geomorphology]] including: The [[Exponential growth|exponential growth equation]], distribution of sedimentary rocks, [[Gas diffusion in soil|diffusion of gas]] through rocks, and [[crenulation]] cleavages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Geology-John-Ferguson/dp/940154011X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494354325&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=mathematics+in+geology+john+ferguson|title=Mathematics in Geology|last=Ferguson|first=John|date=2013-12-31|publisher=Springer|isbn=9789401540117|edition=Softcover reprint of the original 1st ed. 1988|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Glaciology ===
[[Mathematics]] in [[Glaciology]] consists of theoretical, experimental, and modeling. It usually covers [[glacier]]s, [[sea ice]], [[Environmental flow|waterflow]], and the land under the glacier.

[[Crystallite|Polycrystalline]] ice deforms slower than single crystalline ice, due to the stress being on the basal planes that are already blocked by other ice crystals.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Theoretical-Glaciology-Mathematical-Approaches-Geophysics/dp/9401511691/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494354562&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=theoretical+glaciology|title=Theoretical Glaciology: Material Science of Ice and the Mechanics of Glaciers and Ice Sheets|last=Hutter|first=K.|date=1983-08-31|publisher=Springer|isbn=9789401511698|edition=Softcover reprint of the original 1st ed. 1983|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be [[Mathematical model|mathematically modeled]] with [[Hooke's law|Hooke’s Law]] to show the elastic characteristics while using [[Lamé parameters|Lamé constants]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Generally the ice has its linear [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] constants averaged over one dimension of space to simplify the equations while still maintaining accuracy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[Viscoelasticity|Viscoelastic]] [[Crystallite|polycrystalline]] ice is considered to have low amounts of [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] usually below one [[Bar (unit)|bar]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This type of ice system is where one would test for [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] or [[vibration]]s from the [[Tension (physics)|tension]] on the ice. One of the more important equations to this area of study is called the relaxation function.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Where it’s a [[Stress-strain relationship|stress-strain]] relationship independent of time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This area is usually applied to transportation or building onto floating ice.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Shallow-Ice approximation is useful for [[glacier]]s that have variable thickness, with a small amount of stress and variable velocity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; One of the main goals of the mathematical work is to be able to predict the stress and velocity. Which can be affected by changes in the properties of the ice and temperature. This is an area in which the basal shear-stress formula can be used.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7011">'''Global policeman''' is an informal term for a [[State (polity)|state]] which seeks or claims [[global hegemony]].{{according to whom?|date=April 2018}} It has been used, firstly, of the [[British Empire]] and, since 1945, of the [[United States]], the most influential of the [[Four Policemen]] victorious in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Linda Colley]], 'Britain and the US once ran the world. Now they're all at sea', ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gideon Rachman]], 'The world would miss the American policeman', ''[[Financial Times]]'', 2 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years there has been speculation that [[China]] may take over the role&lt;ref name="Stop fretting"&gt;[[Jonas Parello-Plesner]] and [[Parag Khanna]], 'Stop fretting about Beijing as a global policeman', ''[[Financial Times]]'',  28 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; as it reaches out to protect [[shipping lanes]], protect its overseas workers, and 'creeps into the superpower league'. The [[Western world|West]], according to two columnists of the ''[[Financial Times]]'', 'should view this as an opportunity, not a threat.'&lt;ref name="Stop fretting"/&gt;

==In international law==

No formal recognition of this position exists. Theoretically, in [[international law]], all nations are equal; '[[par in parem non habet imperium]]', no authority between equals, is the principle applied. In reality, international law is decentralised, unpoliced, unenforceable, unclear and frequently broken. States are [[Sovereign state#Ontological status of the state|'immortal' and cannot be indicted]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Wight]], [[Power Politics (Wight book)]], 1978, p 98- 109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with state policing==

Within states, law restrains and limits power; between states, the opposite is true.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, Power Politics, 1978 , p 102&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Peelian principles]] of policing include: the duty to prevent crime, keep the peace and uphold the law, with the consent of the public, and with minimal use of force and restraint; to act impartially; and not to usurp the powers of the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Reith]], A new study of police history, Oliver and Boyd, 1956, appendix.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter standard requires a [[presumption of innocence]]. Candidates for police recruitment and promotion are appointed on merit, whereas a 'global policeman' is self-appointed faute de mieux.

Within states, a [[monopoly on violence]] is the norm; the police may carry weapons, but few others do so (the US is an exception, prompting [[Charles Lane (journalist)|Charles Lane]] to ask if it is 'really a state'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/in-the-us-who-has-the-monopoly-on-force/2016/07/13/fbcd45da-490d-11e6-90a8-fb84201e0645_story.html 'In the US, who has the  monopoly on force?'], [[Washington Post]], 13th July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;) Internationally, a 'global policeman' is but one heavily armed state among two hundred others.

To confer the  role of 'global policeman' on any self-interested, expansionary state implies a [[conflict of interest]]. States wage war with maximum force; engage in arms sales; form alliances and thus lack impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel L Davis]], 'What the 'world police' analogy gets wrong,' [[The National Interest]], 2/10/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The comparatively peaceful years 1815–1914 came to be known as [[Pax Britannica]]. The UK made efforts to control the [[Slave trade]] through the [[West Africa Squadron]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk&gt;pdf&gt;britain-and-the-trade.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1827, Britain, jointly with France and Russia, intervened on the side of [[Greek independence]], destroying the Turkish fleet at the [[Battle of Navarino]]. In 1854, Britain, jointly with France, prevented Russia from destroying the [[Ottoman empire]]. Russia had to withdraw from [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]], and [[Sebastopol]] was besieged in the [[Crimean war]].

From 1914–1945 no one state was hegemonic. In an era of [[multipolarity]] and [[diffused responsibility]], fascist dictators arose and Europe sank into two world wars. The authoritarian German challenge to democratic Britain then, is comparable to the authoritarian Chinese challenge to democratic America now, according to [[Richard J Evans]].&lt;ref&gt;'Before the first world war: what can 1914 tell us about 2014?' [[New Statesman]], 23/1/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Truman Doctrine]] of 1947 promised assistance to anticommunist allies. 'The right of neutrality was abolished...it was an era of aggressive peacetime policy which marked the beginning of America's role as global policeman.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Wendy McElroy]], 'How America became the World's Policeman', [[The Daily Bell]], 19/3/2015&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of the [[Cold War]] 'The enemy is terrorism not communism'.&lt;ref&gt;ibid,&lt;/ref&gt; But after a disastrous intervention in [[Somalia]] in 1993, the US was reluctant to engage in [[humanitarian intervention]] in [[Bosnia]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Connor Murphy]], 'World Police Force?' psu.edu, 31/10/2013&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rwanda]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Baldauf]], 'Why the US didn't intervene in the Rwandan massacre', [[Christian Science Monitor]] 7/4/2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The US-led [[Invasion of Iraq]], officially a policing mission to find [[Weapons of Mass Destruction]], has been accused of being an illegal cover for ulterior, unethical motives: the need to secure US regional bases, oil supplies, and the loyalty of key allies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Norton-Taylor]], 'Top judge: US and UK acted as vigilantes in Iraq invasion, Guardian, 17/11/2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Usborne]], 'WMD just an excuse for war, admits Wolfowitz', Independent, 29/5/2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, serious doubts have been raised about the validity of US overseas intervention and destabilization in Iraq, Libya and Syria.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tariq Ali]], 'America's selective vigilantism will make as many enemies as friends', [[The Guardian]], 6/9/2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nathan Gardels]] and [[Hans Blix]], 'America is not the world's policeman - in Syria or Iraq', [[Christian Science Monitor]], 27/8/2013&lt;/ref&gt; Americans accept no law other than their own on US soil, yet expect other nations to submit to the rule of US troops; a [[double standard]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel L Davis]], 'What the World Police Analogy gets wrong', [[The National Interest]], 2/10/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[drone strikes]] on terrorists in Pakistan and Afghanistan goes against the presumption of innocence. The CIA, exempt from the [[Geneva Convention]], is 'secretly sentencing people to death for an unproven crime, without trial or inquest.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Robertson]], 'Drone attacks go against every Human Right in the book', [[New Statesman]], 13/6/2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Qaeda|Al Qaeda]] is not a state, so 'war law' which permits killing of combatants, does not apply.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11881">In [[agriculture]], '''green manure''' is created by leaving uprooted or sown crop parts to wither on a field so that they serve as a [[mulch]] and [[soil amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/green+manure|title=Green manure - Define Green manure at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plants used for green manure are often [[cover crop]]s grown primarily for this purpose. Typically, they are ploughed under and incorporated into the [[soil]] while green or shortly after flowering. Green manure is commonly associated with [[organic farming]] and can play an important role in sustainable annual cropping systems.

==Functions==
Green manures usually perform multiple functions that include soil improvement and soil protection:

* [[Leguminous]] green manures such as [[clover]] and [[vetch]] contain [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] [[symbiotic]] [[bacteria]] in [[root nodules]] that fix atmospheric nitrogen in a form that plants can use. This performs the vital function of fertilization.  If desired, [[animal]] manures may also be added.

:Depending on the species of cover crop grown, the amount of nitrogen released into the soil lies between 40 and 200 pounds per acre. With green manure use, the amount of nitrogen that is available to the succeeding crop is usually in the range of 40-60% of the total amount of nitrogen that is contained within the green manure crop.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

* Green manure acts mainly as [[Soil acidification|soil-acidifying]] matter to decrease the alkalinity/pH of [[alkali soils]] by generating [[humic acid]] and [[acetic acid]].
* Incorporation of [[cover crops]] into the soil allows the nutrients held within the green manure to be released and made available to the succeeding crops. This results immediately from an increase in abundance of soil microorganisms from the degradation of plant material that aid in the decomposition of this fresh material.  This additional decomposition also allows for the re-incorporation of nutrients that are found in the soil in a particular form such as [[nitrogen]] (N), [[potassium]] (K), [[phosphorus]] (P), [[calcium]] (Ca), [[magnesium]] (Mg), and [[sulfur]] (S).
* Microbial activity from incorporation of cover crops into the soil leads to the formation of [[mycelium]] and viscous materials which benefit the health of the soil by increasing its [[soil structure]] (i.e. by aggregation).&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;
:The increased percentage of organic matter ([[biomass]]) improves [[water]] infiltration and retention, aeration, and other soil characteristics. The soil is more easily turned or tilled than non-aggregated soil. Further aeration of the soil results from the ability of the root systems of many green manure crops to efficiently penetrate compact soils. The amount of [[humus]] found in the soil also increases with higher rates of decomposition, which is beneficial for the growth of the crop succeeding the green manure crop. Non-leguminous crops are primarily used to increase biomass.
*The [[root]] systems of some varieties of green manure grow deep in the soil and bring up nutrient resources unavailable to shallower-rooted crops.
* Common [[Cover crop#Weed management|cover crop functions of weed suppression]]. Non-leguminous crops are primarily used (e.g. [[buckwheat]])&lt;ref name="Lawrence 1980 145"/&gt; The deep rooting properties of many green manure crops make them efficient at suppressing [[weed]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vasilakoglou, Ioannis, Dhima, Kico, Anastassopoulos, Elias, Lithourgidis, Anastasios, Gougoulias, Nikolaos, and Chouliaras, Nikolaos. 2011. Oregano green manure for weed suppression in sustainable cotton and corn fields. Weed Biology and Management 11:38-48.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some green manure crops, when allowed to [[flower]], provide [[Forage (honeybee)|forage]] for pollinating [[insect]]s. Green manure crops also often provide habitat for predatory beneficial insects, which allow for a reduction in the application of insecticides where cover crops are planted.
* Some green manure crops (e.g. [[winter wheat]] and [[winter rye]]) can also be used for grazing.&lt;ref name="Lawrence 1980 145"/&gt;
* [[Erosion control]] is often also taken into account when selecting which green manure cover crop to plant.
* Some [[Cover crop#Pest management|green crops reduce plant insect pests]] and [[Cover crop#Disease management|diseases]]. [[Verticillium wilt]] is especially reduced in potato plants.&lt;ref&gt;Larkin, Robert P., Honeycutt, Wayne, and Olanya Modesto, O. 2011.  Management of Verticillium Wilt of Potato with Disease-Suppressive Green Manures and as Affected by Previous Cropping History. Plant Dis. 95:568-576.&lt;/ref&gt;

Incorporation of green manures into a farming system can drastically reduce the need for additional products such as supplemental fertilizers and pesticides.

Limitations to consider in the use of green manure are time, energy, and resources (monetary and natural) required to successfully grow and utilize these cover crops. Consequently, it is important to choose green manure crops based on the growing region and annual precipitation amounts to ensure efficient growth and use of the cover crop(s).

==Nutrient creation==
Green manure is broken down into plant nutrient components by [[heterotrophic]] bacteria that consumes organic matter. Warmth and moisture contribute to this process, similar to creating [[compost]] fertilizer. The plant matter releases large amounts of carbon dioxide and weak acids that react with insoluble soil minerals to release beneficial nutrients. Soils that are high in [[calcium]] minerals, for example, can be given green manure to generate a higher [[phosphate]] content in the soil, which in turn acts as a fertilizer.&lt;ref name="Lawrence 1980 145"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawrence|first=James|title=The Harrowsmith Reader, Volume II|year=1980|publisher=Camden House Publishing Ltd.|isbn=0920656102|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ratio of carbon to [[nitrogen]] in a plant is a crucial factor to consider, since it will impact the nutrient content of the soil and may starve a crop of nitrogen, if the incorrect plants are used to make green manure. The ratio of carbon to nitrogen will differ from species to species, and depending upon the age of the plant. The ratio is referred to as C:N. The value of N is always one, whereas the value of carbon or carbohydrates is expressed in a value of about 10 up to 90; the ratio must be less than 30:1 to prevent the manure bacteria from depleting existing nitrogen in the soil. [[Rhizobium]] are soil organisms that interact with green manure to retain atmospheric nitrogen in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawrence|first=James|title=The Harrowsmith Reader, Volume II|year=1980|publisher=Camden House Publishing Ltd.|isbn=0920656102|pages=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Legume]]s, such as beans, alfalfa, clover and lupines, have root systems rich in rhizobium, often making them the preferred source of green manure material.

==Crops==
Late-summer and fall green manure crops are [[oat]]s and [[rye]].&lt;ref name="mofga"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association| url=http://www.mofga.org/portals/2/Fact%20Sheets/FS%2010%20Green%20Manures%20web.pdf| format=PDF| website=mofga.org|date=November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The value of green manure was recognized by farmers in India for thousands of years, as mentioned in treatises like Vrikshayurveda. In Ancient Greece too, farmers ploughed broad bean plants into the soil. Chinese agricultural texts dating back hundreds of years refer to the importance of grasses and weeds in providing nutrients for farm soil. It was also known to early North American colonists arriving from Europe. Common colonial green manure crops were rye, buckwheat and oats.&lt;ref name="Lawrence 1980 145"/&gt; Traditionally, the incorporation of green manure into the soil is known as the [[fallow]] cycle of [[crop rotation]], which was used to allow the soil to regain its fertility after the harvest.

'''Guerrilla crosswalks''' are created by modifying existing [[pedestrian crossing]] or painting new crosswalk lines. This is done without jurisdictional approval and with the intent of improving pedestrian and other non-automobile safety. These interventions are a common strategy within [[tactical urbanism]], a term used to describe any low-cost, often temporary change to the built environment intended to improve local livability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pfeifer|first=Laura|date=October 23, 2014|title=The Planner's Guide to Tactical Urbanism|url=https://reginaurbanecology.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/tuguide1.pdf|journal=Regina Urban Ecology|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}{{sps|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guerilla crosswalks have been noted in news articles since at least 2009 and have become more well known as an urban strategy in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bikeportland.org/2009/12/28/guerrila-crosswalk-installed-on-east-burnside-27521|title=Guerilla Crosswalk painted on East Burnside|last=Maus|first=Jonathan|date=December 28, 2009|website=|publisher=BikePortland.org|access-date=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Walkability]] and [[quality of life]] indicators are common topics in urban planners' and urban advocates' vocabulary in recent years. With the increasing body of research focused on measuring, and in some cases, marketing the walkability and quality of life in cities, citizens and decision-makers alike are focused on improving intersections, sidewalks, and streetscapes. Tactical urbanism is focused generally on small-scale, quick, and low-cost changes to a place. While some might consider it illegal, it is utilized by both activists and city planners alike when pilot programs and improvements are required immediately and when budget is a significant constraint. 

Many guerrilla tactics react to the delays and inefficiencies in attempting to follow proper or legal channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pagano|first=Celeste|date=2013|title=DIY Urbanism: Property and Process in grassroots city building|url=http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5192&amp;context=mulr|journal=Marquette Law Review|volume=97|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=September 2, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when local residents appeal to a public works department for an additional crosswalk near a school, impatience will inevitably set in after a time of unresponsiveness. Sometimes an act such as painting an unsanctioned [[Crosswalks|crosswalk]] is the only response that will move some jurisdictions to action. Many activists are frustrated with their local street system. Whether they are pedestrians or cyclists, in many cases, they are concerned about traffic speeds and safety around the ever increasing number of cars on the roads. Others simply want safer intersections near their children's schools. Whatever the motivation, guerrilla crosswalks are a strategic response by those unsatisfied with existing conditions.

Although this tactic appears to respond to unsafe conditions at the interface of pedestrian and automobile circulation, it is not without its opponents. One Public Works official commented in this way, "These changes to City streets are illegal, potentially unsafe and adding to the City's costs of maintenance and repair…. There is potential liability and risk management claims to both the City and the individuals involved."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Painting your own crosswalk: crime or civic opportunity?|last=Goodyear|first=Sarah|date=June 5, 2013|url=http://www.citylab.com/commute/2013/06/painting-your-own-crosswalk-crime-or-civic-opportunity/5791/ |publisher=Atlantic: Citylab|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosswalks are a signal to drivers that pedestrians may be present. They are intended to group pedestrians for crossing at a safe time. The introduction of new crosswalks can be confusing to drivers and potentially give pedestrians a false sense of security. 

==Etymology==
The Oxford English Dictionary's definition of [[Guerrilla warfare|guerilla]] includes: "referring to actions or activities performed in an impromptu way, often without authorization."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tactical Urbanism|last=Lydon|first=Mike|last2=Garcia|first2=Anthony|publisher=Island Press|year=2015|isbn=9781610915670|location=|pages=13|via=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JkW9BgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Tactical+Urbanism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwipuqP8--TPAhVcGGMKHTK1AAgQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Guerilla%20crosswalks&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After paving was complete, new crosswalks should have been painted, but the task was left undone with the contractor's justification that the cold weather prevented any street striping. This busy intersection was determined unsafe by many of the locals. Eventually one resident took it upon himself to take action. As he painted the crosswalk lines late into the night, he noticed that cops passed by but no citation was ever given. The local city council woman rather than pursue some level of prosecution actually offered a hearty "thank you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hampden's DIY Crosswalks|date=September 10, 2013|publisher=North Baltimore Patch|last1=Bednar|first1=Adam|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Honolulu]], Hawaii has some of the highest pedestrian fatality rates in the United States. (Wong 2012)  Many of their busiest intersections reflect city standards from years past without modification as the quantity of vehicular traffic and associated speeds have changed dramatically. Some residents chose to take a stand in 2014. Within the crosswalk of one of these busy intersections, residents altered the crosswalk lines so that they spelled out "Aloha," the traditional Hawaiian salutation. While the perpetrators sought to introduce a level of humanity to the dangerous location, city officials stated that the change was a "deviation from the standard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=February 2014|publisher=StrongTowns blog|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, [[Chicago]] has seen a different level of activism to protect pedestrians within an existing crosswalk. In Spring of 2016, the city of Chicago posted signage to a unique intersection: no left turn. To call attention to this new condition, an unknown person installed two small planter boxes within the crosswalk with flowering plants. Many responded positively while local businesses expressed concern for the traffic pattern change and its effect on their business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eyes on the Street: Tactical Urbanism Blooms on Broadway|date=April 21, 2016|publisher=StreetsBlog Chicago|last1=Greenfield|first1=John|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hack Reactor''' is a [[software engineering]] [[Coding Bootcamp]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coursereport.com/schools/hack-reactor|title=Course Report: Hack Reactor|date=2016|website=Course Report|quote=Founded in 2012, Hack Reactor is a 12-week immersive coding school in San Francisco providing software engineering education, career placement services, and a lifelong network of professional peers.|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; education program founded in [[San Francisco]] by Anthony Phillips, Shawn Drost, Marcus Phillips, and Douglas Calhoun in 2012.&lt;ref name=TGM150411&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Alicia|title=Hack Reactor seeks to bridge the technology divide|url=http://techgenmag.com/2015/04/11/hack-reactor-seeks-to-bridge-the-technology-divide/|accessdate=2 July 2015|work=Tech Generation Magazine|date=11 April 2015|location=Long Beach, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their coding bootcamp is currently offered in 12-week Full-Time and 9-month Part-Time formats, in-person in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City and Austin, as well as remotely, live online.

Cofounder Drost has described the program as, "optimized for people who want to be software engineers as their main, day-to-day work. Their life's work."&lt;ref name=Downs131013/&gt; The curriculum focuses on [[JavaScript]] and associated technologies including the MEAN stack, React and Backbone.&lt;ref name="BI130614"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/hot-education-startups-2013-6?op=1|title=12 New Companies That Will Make Going To College Unnecessary|date=14 June 2013|work=[[Business Insider]]|last1=Russell|first1=Kyle|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://techbeacon.com/complete-guide-top-24-coding-bootcamps|title=Complete Guide to the top 24 Coding Bootcamps|website=TechBeacon|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Hack Reactor acquired Austin-based [[MakerSquare]] as "their first deal in a plan to develop a network of coding bootcamps" in an effort to "make a large dent in transforming the old education system into one that focuses on student outcomes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newman|first1=Kira M.|title=Coding Bootcamp Hack Reactor Acquires MakerSquare|url=http://tech.co/coding-bootcamp-hack-reactor-acquires-makersquare-2015-01|website=Tech Cocktail|accessdate=2 July 2015|date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following month, a pair of Hack Reactor alumni partnered with the company to open Telegraph Academy "to teach software engineering to under-represented minorities" and create a "growing community of diverse software engineers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telegraphacademy.com/|title=Telegraph Academy the Leading Coding School for People of Color.|website=Telegraph Academy|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dugdale|first1=Emily|title=Berkeley coding school aims to help close tech race gap|url=http://www.berkeleyside.com/2015/06/22/berkeley-coding-school-telegraph-academy-launches-aimed-at-people-of-color/|website=Berkeleyside|accessdate=2 July 2015|date=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, Hack Reactor rebranded all of its schools to share the Hack Reactor name.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc-7.com/story/33548858/hack-reactor-unifies-its-network-of-coding-schools-under-flagship-brand|title=Hack Reactor Unifies Its Network of Coding Schools under Flagship Brand|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Admissions process ==
Hack Reactor's admissions standard has been described as "highly selective, only accepting ten to fifteen percent of applicants for each cohort."&lt;ref name="TGM150411" /&gt; Though many applicants who do not pass the first admission interview are encouraged to try again when they feel they are better prepared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quora.com/Did-Hack-Reactor-become-a-group-full-of-elitists#ans13162184|title=Did Hack Reactor become a group full of elitists?|last1=Pethiyagoda|first1=Ruan|date=9 June 2015|website=Quora|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, Hack Reactor has two admissions paths. Students can either self-study and pass a technical interview or join their Structured Study Program, a live class which includes preparation, readiness assessment and admittance.

The technical interview tests both technical skills (JavaScript basics such as objects, arrays, functions and the ability to solve basic coding problems using JavaScript) and soft skills, such as the student’s willingness and ability to learn.

Hack Reactor has created financial partnerships with SkillsFund and Climb Credit and to assist students with paying tuition.&lt;ref name="hackreactor.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hackreactor.com/questions|title=FAQ|website=Coding Bootcamp in San Francisco. JavaScript focused programming school.|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, [[WeFinance]] and Reactor Core (Hack Reactor's parent company) have launched a platform that allows anyone to lend to incoming students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wefinance.co/group/reactor_core|title=Lend to the Reactor Core Family|website=www.wefinance.co|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Course Structure ==
Accepted students are assigned pre-course work, which takes "at least 50-80 hours" and is due prior to the start of their cohort.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Hack Reactor’s course is offered in 12-week full-time and 9-month part-time formats. During the first half of the program, students work in pairs on two-day “sprints.” Pair and group work helps teach communication and collaboration skills. During this part of the course, the day typically starts with a “toy problem,” which is a programming challenge designed to illustrate core concepts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.computerpoweruser.com/article/19555/qa-with-phillip-alexander|title=Q&amp;A with Phillip Alexander|last=|first=|date=2016-12-28|website=Computer Power User|publisher=Computer Power User|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is followed by a lecture in which the instructor frequently checks in with students to assess how well they understand the material.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The JavaScript tools and technologies taught at Hack Reactor include [[AngularJS|Angular]], [[Node.js|Node]], [[MongoDB]], [[Express.js|Express]], [[React (JavaScript library)|React]], [[Backbone.js|Backbone]] and [[ECMAScript|ES6]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursereport.com/blog/hack-reactor-vs-makersquare-your-ultimate-guide|title=Hack Reactor vs MakerSquare: Your Ultimate Guide|website=www.coursereport.com|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this part of the course is for students to become “autonomous learners and programmers.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursereport.com/schools/hack-reactor#/news/instructor-spotlight-fred-zirdung-of-hack-reactor|title=Hack Reactor Reviews {{!}} Course Report|website=www.coursereport.com|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second half of the course focuses on projects. Students complete “increasingly elaborate” coding projects of their own design, using whatever languages and frameworks they choose. Students often adopt technologies not taught in the course using “fundamentals and self-teaching methods” taught in the first half of the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://techbeacon.com/complete-guide-top-24-coding-bootcamps|title=Complete guide to the top 24 coding bootcamps|website=TechBeacon|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Student Outcomes ==
Co-Founder Shawn Drost says that Hack Reactor is "committed to being the leading coding immersive in terms of quality, student experience and student outcomes." In 2017, they joined a 501(c)(6) non-profit organization called the Council on Integrity in Results Reporting (CIRR) as a founding member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hackreactor.com/blog/hack-reactor-cirr-outcomes-reporting|title=CIRR Raises the Bar in Student Outcomes Reporting|work=Hack Reactor|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIRR requires members to report "the outcomes of every enrolled student must be reported in a single, simple, clear report" using common standards and follow "CIRR Truth in Advertising policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cirr.org/standards|title=High standards and a commitment to transparency and accountability. - Council on Integrity in Results Reporting (CIRR)|website=cirr.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hack Reactor Remote ==
In July 2014, Hack Reactor launched an online program, Hack Reactor Remote. This program has the same curriculum, course structure and teaching method as Hack Reactor’s onsite program. Students attend and participate in the lectures at the same time as the other students, work on the same assignments, and benefit from the same job search and placement resources as the onsite program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/06/16/hack-reactor-is-launching-an-online-coding-bootcamp-but-you-still-need-to-quit-life-to-do-it/|title=Hack Reactor is launching an online coding bootcamp, but you still need to quit life to do it|website=VentureBeat|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hack Reactor's Remote program has comparable student outcomes to its in-person campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hackreactor.com/outcomes|title=Student Outcomes &amp; Graduate Performance|website=Hack Reactor|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Hack Reactor began offering a part-time version of their remote program, known as Hack Reactor Remote Part-Time.

== MakerSquare Acquisition ==
In January 2015, Hack Reactor acquired coding bootcamp MakerSquare, which had locations in Austin and San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/01/coding-bootcamp-boom-continues-hack-reactor-buy/|title=Hack Reactor Expands Its Code Bootcamps by Acquiring a Rival|website=WIRED|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; MakerSquare has since expanded into Los Angeles and New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-makersquare-los-angeles-20150408-story.html|title=MakerSquare to open L.A. campus to train software engineers|last=Times|first=Los Angeles|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/makersquare-school-of-software-engineering-launches-new-york-city-campus-300233910.html|title=MakerSquare School of Software Engineering Launches New York City Campus|last=|first=|date=10 March 2016|website=PR Newswire|publisher=PR Newswire|access-date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MakerSquare has the same admissions process, hiring partner network, and the same curriculum with a few small modifications.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In November 2016, they rebranded to share the Hack Reactor name.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Social Responsibility ==

=== Code.7370 ===
In collaboration with The Last Mile, Hack Reactor launched Code.7370, a coding program in San Quentin State Prison. Inmates have to apply to be a part of the program. Once accepted, they learn HTML, CSS, Python and JavaScript for 8 hours a day, 4 days a week.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fastcoexist.com/3038589/the-prison-coding-class-that-might-have-inmates-making-six-figures-on-their-release|title=The Prison Coding Class That Might Have Inmates Making Six Figures On Their Release|date=2014-11-17|website=Co.Exist|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hack Reactor instructors volunteered as teachers. In addition to class time students are also given time to work on personal projects.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Because inmates are not permitted access to the internet, Code.7370 operates by a proprietary programming platform that simulates a normal web environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thelastmile.org/|title=The Last Mile – Paving The Road to Success|website=thelastmile.org|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of Code.7370 is to reduce recidivism and help felons reenter the workforce.

=== ReBootKAMP ===
Hack Reactor helped launch ReBootKAMP, a coding bootcamp in Jordan that focuses on Syrian refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.barakabits.com/2016/01/rebooting-lives-syrian-refugees-rebootkamp|title=Rebooting the lives of Syrian Refugees-ReBootKAMP - BarakaBits|date=2016-01-31|website=BarakaBits|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ReBootKAMP uses Hack Reactor’s curriculum, and received volunteer assistance from Hack Reactor staff and alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rbk.org/|title=RBK {{!}} Empowering Youth For Positive Change|website=rbk.org|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ReBootKAMP executives also received training on coding bootcamp best practices from Hack Reactor and Reactor Core.

=== Hola&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;code/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; ===
In December 2017, Hack Reactor supported the launch of Hola&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;code/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, a coding bootcamp based in Mexico City focused on bringing new opportunities to recent returnees. Hola&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;code/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; is powered by Hack Reactor curriculum and Hack Reactor alumni have been part of their teaching team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hackreactor.com/blog/founders-letter|title=5 Years Forward - Hack Reactor's Founders, CEO Celebrate Past, Present, and Great Future|work=Hack Reactor|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://holacode.com/ |title=Hola&amp;lt;code/&gt; |access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human science''' studies the philosophical, [[biological]], social, and cultural aspects of human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses-listing/human-sciences?wssl=1| title=Human Sciences |publisher=University of Oxford | access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human Sciences aims to expand our understanding of the [[human]] world through a broad interdisciplinary approach. It encompasses a wide range of fields - including [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[genetics]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[neurosciences]] and [[anthropology]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/journal/history-human-sciences#description | title=History of the Human Sciences |publisher= SAGE Publications Inc. | access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the study and interpretation of the experiences, activities, constructs, and artifacts associated with human beings. The study of the human sciences attempts to expand and enlighten the human being's knowledge of their existence, its interrelationship with other [[species]] and systems, and the development of artifacts to perpetuate the [[human]] expression and [[thought]]. It is the study of human [[phenomena]]. The study of the human experience is historical and current in nature. It requires the evaluation and interpretation of the historic human experience and the analysis of current human activity to gain an understanding of human phenomena and to project the outlines of [[human evolution]]. Human science is the [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], informed critique of human existence and how it relates to [[reality]].

==Meaning of 'science'==
Ambiguity and confusion regarding usage of the terms '[[science]]', '[[empirical science]]', and '[[scientific method]]' have complicated the usage of the term 'human science' with respect to human activities. The term 'science' is derived from the Latin ''scientia'' meaning 'knowledge'. 'Science' may be appropriately used to refer to any branch of knowledge or study dealing with a body of facts or truths systematically arranged to show the operation of general laws.

However, according to [[Positivism|Positivists]], the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge which comes from positive affirmation of theories through strict scientific method, the application of knowledge or mathematics. As a result of the positivist influence, the term ''science'' is frequently employed as a synonym for ''empirical science''. Empirical science is knowledge based on the [[scientific method]], a systematic approach to verification of knowledge first developed for dealing with natural physical phenomena and emphasizing the importance of experience based on sensory observation. However, even with regard to the [[natural sciences]], significant difference exist among scientists and philosophers of science with regard to what constitutes valid scientific method&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl, ''Logic of Scientific Discovery'', Routledge, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2012}}—for example, [[evolutionary biology]], [[geology]] and [[astronomy]], studying events that cannot be repeated, can use a method of historical narratives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e36_2/darwin_influence.htm Mayr, Ernst. ''Darwin's Influence on Modern Thought''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060717184042/http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e36_2/darwin_influence.htm |date=2006-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, usage of the term has been extended to the study of human social phenomena. Thus, natural and social sciences are commonly classified as science, whereas the study of classics, languages, literature, music, philosophy, history, religion, and the visual and performing arts are referred to as the [[humanities]]. Ambiguity with respect to the meaning of the term ''science'' is aggravated by the widespread use of the term [[formal science]] with reference to any one of several sciences that is predominantly concerned with abstract form that cannot be validated by physical experience through the senses, such as logic, mathematics, and the theoretical branches of computer science, information theory, and statistics.

==History==
The phrase 'human science' in English was used during the 17th-century scientific revolution, for example by [[Theophilus Gale]]&lt;ref name="Gale1677"&gt;{{cite book|author=Theophilus Gale|title=The Court of the Gentiles, Or, A Discourse Touching the Original of Human Literature: Both Philologie and Philosophie, from the Scriptures &amp; Jewish Church : in Order of a Demonstration Of, I. The Perfection of Gods Word, and Church-light. II. The Imperfection of Natures Light ... III. The Right Use of Human Learning ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GjCI52YG1zIC&amp;pg=RA3-PA327|year=1677|publisher=H. Hall|pages=3–}}&lt;/ref&gt;, to draw a distinction between supernatural knowledge (divine science) and study by humans (human science). [[John Locke]] also uses 'human science' to mean knowledge produced by people, but without the distinction&lt;ref name="Locke1753"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Locke|title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=brYUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA170|year=1753|publisher=S. Birt|pages=170–}}&lt;/ref&gt;. By the 20th century, this latter meaning was used at the same time&lt;ref name="Jennings1930"&gt;{{cite book|author=Herbert Spencer Jennings|title=The Biological Basis of Human Nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lu0nAAAAYAAJ|year=1930|publisher=W.W. Norton, Incorporated}}&lt;/ref&gt; as 'sciences that make human beings the topic of research'.&lt;ref name="Education1928"&gt;{{cite book|author=United States. Congress. House. Committee on Education|title=Proposed department of education: Hearing&amp;#91;s&amp;#93; before the Committee on education, House of Representatives, Seventieth Congress, first session on H. R. 7, a bill to create a department of education and for other purposes. April 25, 26, 27,28 and May 2, 1928|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGkvAAAAMAAJ|year=1928|publisher=U.S. Govt. print. off.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human science''' (also, '''humanistic social science''', '''moral science''' and '''human sciences''') refers to the investigation of human life and activities via an interdisciplinary framework spanning the sciences and humanities. Underlying Human science is the relationship between various humanistic modes of inquiry within fields such as, [[history]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]] and [[economics]], and advances in such things as [[genetics]], [[evolutionary biology]] and the [[social sciences]] for the purpose of understanding our lives in a rapidly changing world. Its use of an [[empirical]] methodology that encompasses psychological experience contrasts to the purely [[positivism|positivistic]] approach typical of the [[natural sciences]] which exclude all methods not based solely on sensory observations. Modern approaches in the human sciences integrate an understanding of human structure, function and adaptation with a broader exploration of what it means to be human.  The term is also used to distinguish not only the content of a field of study from those of the natural sciences, but also its methodology.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;Georg Henrik von Wright, ''Explanation and Understanding'', {{ISBN|0-8014-0644-7}}, pp. 4–7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early development===
The term '''moral science''' was used by [[David Hume|David Hume (1711-1776)]] in his ''Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals'' to refer to the systematic study of human nature and relationships. Hume wished to establish a "science of human nature" based upon [[empirical]] phenomena, and excluding all that does not arise from [[observation]]. Rejecting [[teleological]], [[theological]] and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] explanations, Hume sought to develop an essentially descriptive methodology; phenomena were to be precisely characterized. He emphasized the necessity of carefully explicating the cognitive content of ideas and vocabulary, relating these to their empirical roots and real-world significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/ "David Hume"], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of early thinkers in the humanistic sciences took up Hume's direction. [[Adam Smith]], for example, conceived of economics as a moral science in the [[David Hume|Hume]]an sense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acton.org/publicat/m_and_m/2001_spring/crespo.html Book Review] of Jeffrey T. Young's ''Economics As a Moral Science: The Political Economy of Adam Smith''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later development===
Partly in reaction to the establishment of [[positivism|positivist philosophy]] and the latter's [[Auguste Comte|Comtean]] intrusions into traditionally humanistic areas such as sociology, non-postivistic researchers in the humanistic sciences began to carefully but emphatically distinguish the methodological approach appropriate to these areas of study, for which the unique and distinguishing characteristics of phenomena are in the forefront (e.g. for the biographer), from that appropriate to the [[natural science]]s, for which the ability to link phenomena into generalized groups is foremost. In this sense, [[Johann Gustav Droysen]] contrasted the humanistic science's need to ''comprehend'' the phenomena under consideration with natural science's need to ''explain'' phenomena, while [[Windelband]] coined the terms [[idiographic]] for a descriptive study of the individual nature of phenomena, and [[nomothetic]] for sciences that aim to define the generalizing laws.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;

[[Wilhelm Dilthey]] brought nineteenth-century attempts to formulate a methodology appropriate to the humanistic sciences together with Hume's term "moral science", which he translated as ''[[Geisteswissenschaft]]'' - a term with no exact English equivalent. Dilthey attempted to articulate the entire range of the moral sciences in a comprehensive and systematic way.&lt;ref name="Dilthey"&gt;Wilhelm Dilthey, ''An Introduction to the Human Sciences'', Princeton Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Chap. I}} Meanwhile, his conception of “Geisteswissenschaften” encompasses also the abovementioned study of classics, languages, literature, music, philosophy, history, religion, and the visual and performing arts. He characterized the scientific nature of a study as depending upon:&lt;ref name="Dilthey"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter XI}}
* The conviction that perception gives access to reality
* The self-evident nature of logical reasoning
* The [[principle of sufficient reason]]
But the specific nature of the ''Geisteswissenschaften'' is based on the "inner" experience (''Erleben''), the "comprehension" (''[[Verstehen]]'') of the meaning of expressions and "understanding" in terms of the relations of the part and the whole – in contrast to the ''Naturwissenschaften'', the "[[explanation]]" of phenomena by [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]] laws in the "[[natural science]]s".&lt;ref name=Dilthey7&gt;Wilhelm Dilthey, ''Gesammelte Schriften'', vol. VII&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 86}}

[[Edmund Husserl]], a student of [[Franz Brentano]], articulated his phenomenological philosophy in a way that could be thought as a basis of Dilthey's attempt. Dilthey appreciated Husserl's ''Logische Untersuchungen''&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations'', 1973 [1913], Findlay, J. N., trans. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; (1900/1901, the first draft of Husserl's ''Phenomenology'') as an “epoch making“ epistemological foundation of his conception of Geisteswissenschaften.&lt;ref name=Dilthey7/&gt;{{rp|p. 14}}

In recent years, 'human science' has been used to refer to "a philosophy and approach to science that seeks to understand human experience in deeply subjective, personal, historical, contextual, cross-cultural, political, and spiritual terms. Human science is the science of qualities rather than of quantities and closes the subject-object split in science. In particular, it addresses the ways in which self-reflection, art, music, poetry, drama, language and imagery reveal the human condition. By being interpretive, reflective, and appreciative, human science re-opens the conversation among science, art, and philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saybrook.edu/phs/academicprograms/hs Saybrook Graduate School]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective vs. subjective experiences==

Since [[Auguste Comte]], the positivistic [[social science]]s have sought to imitate the approach of the natural sciences by emphasizing the importance of objective external observations and searching for universal laws whose operation is predicated on external initial conditions that do not take into account differences in subjective human [[perception]] and attitude. Critics argue that [[subjectivity|subjective]] human experience and intention plays such a central role in determining human social behavior that an objective approach to the social sciences is too confining. Rejecting the positivist influence, they argue that the scientific method can rightly be applied to subjective, as well as objective, experience. The term subjective is used in this context to refer to inner [[psychological]] experience rather than outer [[sensory perception|sensory]] experience. It is not used in the sense of being prejudiced by personal motives or beliefs.

==Human sciences in universities==
The Human Sciences degree is relatively young. It has been a degree subject at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] since 1969, and at [[University College London|UCL]] was proposed in 1973 by Professor [[John Zachary Young|J. Z. Young]] and implemented two years later. His aim was to train general science graduates who would be scientifically literate, numerate and easily able to communicate across a wide range of disciplines, replacing the traditional Classics training for higher-level government and management careers. Central topics include the evolution of [[human]]s, their behaviour, [[molecular]] and population [[genetics]], population growth and ageing, ethnic and cultural diversity and the human interaction with the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], including conservation, disease and [[nutrition]]. The study of both [[biological]] and social disciplines, integrated within a framework of human diversity and sustainability, should enable the human scientist to develop professional competencies suited to address such multidimensional human problems. In the [[United Kingdom]], Human Sciences is offered at degree level at several institutions. These include:

The '''hypodermic needle model''' (known as the '''hypodermic-syringe model''', '''transmission-belt model''', or '''magic bullet theory''') is a model of [[communication]] suggesting that an intended message is directly received and wholly accepted by the receiver. The model was originally rooted in 1930s [[behaviorism]] and largely considered obsolete for a long time, but [[big data]] analytics-based [[mass customization]] has led to a modern revival of the basic idea.

==Concept==
The "magic bullet" or "hypodermic needle theory" of direct influence effects was based on early observations of the effect of mass media, as used by [[Nazi propaganda]] and the effects of [[Hollywood]] in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Commmunication Theory; Mass Communication: MAGIC BULLET OR HYPODERMIC NEEDLE THEORY OF COMMUNICATION http://communicationtheory.org/magic-bullet-or-hypodermic-needle-theory-of-communication/&lt;/ref&gt; People were assumed to be "uniformly controlled by their biologically based 'instincts' and that they react more or less uniformly to whatever 'stimuli' came along".&lt;ref&gt;Lowery, Shearon (1995). ''Milestones in Mass Communication Research: Media Effects'' (en inglés). USA: Longman Publishers. p. 400. {{ISBN|9780801314377}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Magic Bullet" theory graphically assumes that the media's message is a bullet fired from the "media gun" into the viewer's "head".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Asa (1995). Essentials of Mass Communication Theory. Londres: SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the "Hypodermic Needle Model" uses the same idea of the "shooting" paradigm. It suggests that the media injects its messages straight into the passive audience.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;D. Croteau, W. Hoynes (1197). ''Media/society: industries, images, and audiences''. Pine Forge Press. {{ISBN|9780803990654}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This passive audience is immediately affected by these messages. The public essentially cannot escape from the media's influence, and is therefore considered a "sitting duck".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both models suggest that the public is vulnerable to the messages shot at them because of the limited communication tools and the studies of the media's effects on the masses at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, D.K. &amp; Baron, S.J. (1981). ''A History of Our Understanding of Mass Communication''. Belmont: Wadsworth Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; It means the media explores information in such a way that it injects in the mind of audiences as bullets.

The "magic bullet" and "hypodermic needle" models originate from [[Harold Lasswell]]'s 1927 book, ''Propaganda Technique in the World War''.&lt;ref&gt;Lasswell, H. (1927) "Propaganda Technique in the World War"&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work in the history of communication studies have documented how the two models may have served as strawman theory or fallacy&lt;ref&gt;Lubken, Deborah. (2008). Remembering the Straw Man: The Travels and Adventures of Hypodermic. In D. W. Park &amp; J. Pooley (Eds.), The history of media and communication research: contested memories: Peter Lang Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; or even a "myth".&lt;ref&gt;Sproule, J. M. (1989). Progressive Propaganda Critics and the Magic Bullet Myth. Critical Studies in Mass Communication, 6(3), 225-246. doi:citeulike-article-id:9472331&lt;/ref&gt; Others have documented the possible medical origins of the metaphor of the magic bullet model.&lt;ref&gt;Thibault, Ghislain. (2016). Needles and Bullets: Media Theory, Medicine, and Propaganda, 1910-1940. In K. Nixon &amp; L. Servitje (Eds.), Endemic: Essays in Contagion Theory (pp. 67-91). Basingstoke: [[Palgrave Macmillan]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two-step flow==
{{main|Two-step flow of communication}}
The phrasing "hypodermic needle" is meant to give a mental image of the direct, strategic, and planned infusion of a message into an individual. But as research methodology became more highly developed, it became apparent that the media had selective influences on people.

The most famous incident often cited as an example for the hypodermic needle model was the 1938 broadcast of ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|The War of the Worlds]]'' and the subsequent reaction of widespread panic among its [[United States|American]] mass audience. However, this incident actually sparked the research movement, led by [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] and [[Herta Herzog]], that would disprove the magic bullet or hypodermic needle theory, as [[Hadley Cantril]] managed to show that reactions to the broadcast were, in fact, diverse, and were largely determined by situational and attitudinal attributes of the listeners.

In the 1940s, Lazarsfeld disproved the "magic bullet" theory and "hypodermic needle model theory" through elections studies in "The People's Choice".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Felix Lazarsfeld, Bernard Berelson, Hazel Gaudet (1948). ''The People's Choice: How the Voter Makes Up His Mind in a Presidential Campaign''. Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Lazarsfeld and colleagues executed the study by gathering research during the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940. The study was conducted to determine voting patterns and the relationship between the media and political power. Lazarsfeld discovered that the majority of the public remained unfazed by propaganda surrounding Roosevelt's campaign. Instead, interpersonal outlets proved more influential than the media. Therefore, Lazarsfeld concluded that the effects of the campaign were not all powerful to the point where they completely persuaded "helpless audiences", a claim that the Magic Bullet, Hypodermic Needle Model, and Lasswell asserted. These new findings also suggested that the public can select which messages affect and don't affect them.

Lazarsfeld's debunking of these models of communication provided the way for new ideas regarding the media's effects on the public. Lazarsfeld introduced the idea of the [[two-step flow of communication]]&lt;ref&gt;''cf.'' [[Two-step flow model]]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1944. [[Elihu Katz]] contributed to the model in 1955 through studies and publications.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elihu Katz|Katz, E.]], [[Paul Lazarsfeld|Lazarsfeld, P.F.]] (1955) ‘Personal influence: The part played by people in the flow of mass communications‘, The Free Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The model of the two-step flow of communication assumes that ideas flow from the mass media to opinion leaders and then to the greater public. They believed the message of the media to be transferred to the masses via this [[opinion leadership]]. Opinion leaders are categorized as individuals with the best understanding of media content and the most accessibility to the media as well. These leaders essentially take in the media's information, and explain and spread the media's messages to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1957|title=The Two-Step Flow of Communication: An Up-To-Date Report on an Hypothesis|doi=10.1086/266687|journal=[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]|volume=21|issue=1|pages=61–78|last1=Katz|first1=Elihu|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1279&amp;context=asc_papers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the two step flow model and other communication theories suggest that the media does not directly have an influence on viewers anymore. Instead, interpersonal connections and even [[selective exposure]] play a larger role in influencing the public in the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Joseph Severin, James W. Tankard (1979). ''Communication Theories: Origins, Methods, Uses''. Hastings House. {{ISBN|9780803812741}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary one-step flow==
More recently, the use of [[big data]] analytics to identify user preferences and to send tailor-made messages to individuals led back to the idea of a "one-step flow of communication", which is in principle similar to the hypodermic needle model.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, W. L., &amp; Manheim, J. B. (2006). The One-Step Flow of Communication. The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 608(1), 213–232. http://doi.org/10.1177/0002716206292266&lt;/ref&gt; The difference is that today's massive databases allow for the [[mass customization]] of messages. So it is not one generic [[mass media]] message, but many individualized messages, coordinated by a massive algorithm. For example, [[empirical studies]] have found that in [[Twitter]] networks, traditional mass media outlets receive 80–90% of their Twitter mentions directly through a direct one-step flow from average Twitter users.&lt;ref name="HilbertTwostep"&gt;Hilbert, M., Vasquez, J., Halpern, D., Valenzuela, S., &amp; Arriagada, E. (2016). [http://doi.org/10.1177/0894439316639561 One Step, Two Step, Network Step? Complementary Perspectives on Communication Flows in Twittered Citizen Protests]. [[Social Science Computer Review]]. Freely available at http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0nn4p7mv&lt;/ref&gt; However, these same studies also argue that there is a multitude of step-flow models at work in today's digital communication landscape.&lt;ref name="HilbertTwostep"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Choi, S. (2014). The Two-Step Flow of Communication in Twitter-Based Public Forums. Social Science Computer Review, 0894439314556599.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stansberry, K. (2012).

[[Andreas Cellarius]], German mathematician and cartographer (1596–1665), conceived an Atlas of the Universe, published in 1660, under the title of ''[[Harmonia Macrocosmica]]''. Numerous illustrations of the solar system appear in this atlas by different authors known at that time. Referring to Ptolemy, Cellarius called the representation of this Ptolemaic conception of heaven as "Imago universi secundum Ptolaeum"

''Imago'' is a word in [[Latin]] which means'' 'image''' or even "representation". Therefore, the title expresses the "Picture of the Universe according to Ptolemy." The Latin expression was used in the Middle Ages to express the representation and size of the known world at that time.

''Imago Universi'' is also the title, in Latin, of a [[cosmography|cosmographic]] treatise, written in 2013 by the Spanish scientist Gabriel Barceló.

After analyzing the history of cosmology, the treatise delves into the prevailing scientific lack of explanation of the rotation of the heavenly bodies in the laws of dynamic behaviour of the sidereal system. The author proposes the application of the [[Theory of Dynamic Interactions]] (TID) to astrophysics, in particular, the dynamics of stellar systems and galaxies. This theory allows new comprehension of the dynamics of nature and understands the dynamic equilibrium of the universe, always subjected to rotational accelerations, but repetitive and persistent. The author also highlights that the orbiting always coincides with the intrinsic rotation of celestial bodies. Paradox incorporating the book, noting that this had not been found to date.

'''Internet Security Awareness Training''' (ISAT) consists of the training of members of an organization regarding the protection of various information assets of that organization. Organizations that need to comply with government regulations (i.e. [[GLBA]], [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard|PCI]], [[HIPAA]], [[Sarbox]]) normally require formal ISAT for all employees, usually once or twice a year. Many Small and Medium Enterprises (SME's) do not require ISAT for regulatory compliance, but train their employees to prevent [[Cyberheist|a cyberheist]]. Internet Security Awareness Training at this point in time is usually provided via online courses. ISAT is a subset of general [[security awareness]] Training.

Topics covered in ISAT include:

*Appropriate methods for protecting sensitive information on personal [[computer]] systems, including [[password policy]]
*Various computer security concerns, including [[Spam (electronic)|spam]], [[malware]], [[phishing]], [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]], etc.
*Consequences of failure to properly protect information, including potential job loss, economic consequences to the firm, damage to individuals whose private records are divulged, and possible civil and criminal law penalties.

Being Internet Security Aware means you understand that there are people actively trying to steal data that is stored within your organization's computers.  (This often focuses on user names and passwords, so that criminal elements can ultimately get access to bank accounts and other high-value IT assets.) That is why it is important to protect the assets of the organization and stop that from happening.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

According to Microsoft,
* End User Internet Security  Awareness Training  resides in the Policies, Procedures, and Awareness layer of the Defense in Depth security model.
* User security awareness can affect every aspect of an organization’s security profile.
* End User Security awareness is a significant part of a comprehensive security profile because many attack types rely on human intervention (Social Engineering) to succeed.

The focus of ISAT is to achieve an immediate and lasting change in the attitude of employees towards Internet Security, making it clear that security policies and Acceptable Use policies are vital for the survival of the organization, and not as rules that restrict the employee being efficient at work.

Security awareness training for employees is one of the most effective means of reducing the potential for costly errors in handling sensitive information and protecting company information systems.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Training can be conducted through a number of means and certain approaches are more effective than others:
* The Do-Nothing Approach: The organization conducts no security awareness training and relies on automated systems to protect against phishing and malware.
* The Breakroom Approach: Employees are gathered during lunches or meetings and are told what to look out for in emails, web surfing, etc.
* The Monthly Security Video Approach: Employees are shown short videos that explain how to keep the organization safe and secure.
* The [[simulated phishing|Phishing Test]] Approach: Certain employees are pre-selected and sent [[simulated phishing]] attacks, IT determines whether they fell prey to the attack, and those employees get remedial training.
* The Human Firewall Approach: Everyone in the organization is tested, the percentage of employees who are prone to phishing attacks is determined, and then everyone is trained on major attack vectors. Simulated phishing attacks are sent to all employees on a regular basis.

Security Awareness Training can ensure personnel have a solid understanding of their employer’s security practices and policies. In contrast, an uninformed employee is susceptible to malware, phishing attacks, and other forms of social engineering. They can do substantial harm to an organization’s systems and place its data at risk.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Key aspects of any awareness training program should include the following:
* Train on an ongoing basis. Avoid limiting training to when an employee is first hired or assigned to a new role in the organization.
* Train creatively, not just in a non-interactive class-room setting.
* Look for means to introduce interactivity into the training process.
* Have a means of measuring progress and Phish-prone percentage of employees.

'''Jurimetrics''' is the application of quantitative methods, and often especially [[statistics]], to [[law]].&lt;ref&gt;Zabala, F.J., Silveira, F.F., "Jurimetria: Estatística Aplicada ao Direito". ''Revista Direito e Liberdade'', Natal, v. 16, n. 1, pp. 73-86, Jan./Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="garner"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage|page=488|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0195142365|chapter=jurimetrics|isbn=0195142365|first=Bryan A. |last=Garner|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject has gained considerable currency in both the United States and Brazil. In the United States, the journal ''[[Jurimetrics (journal)|Jurimetrics]]'' is published by the [[American Bar Association]] and [[Arizona State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/publications/jurimetrics|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=2015-02-06|title=Jurimetrics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Brazil, the field is the focus of a dedicated scholarly organization, the Brazilian Jurimetrics Association, which describes itself as "a nonprofit organization gathering researchers in Law and Mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abjur.org.br/en/|publisher=Brazilian Jurimetrics Association|title=Check out our activities|accessdate=2015-02-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207082908/http://www.abjur.org.br/en/|archivedate=2015-02-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined in 1949 by [[Lee Loevinger]] in his article "Jurimetrics: The Next Step Forward".&lt;ref name="garner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loevinger, L. "Jurimetrics: The Next Step Forward". Heidi Online, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Showing the influence of [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], Loevinger quoted&lt;ref&gt;Loevinger, L. "Jurimetrics: Science and prediction in the field of law". ''[[Minnesota Law Review]]'', vol. 46, HeinOnline, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes' celebrated phrase that "the man of the future is the man of statistics and the master of economics.".&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, ''The Path of the Law'', 10 ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' (1897) 457.&lt;/ref&gt; The first work on this topic is attributed to [[Nicolaus I Bernoulli]] in his doctoral dissertation ''De Usu Artis Conjectandi in Jure'', written in 1709.

The possibilities for applying jurimetrics are diverse, from analyses of the frequency of proceedings to the development of models to support decisionmaking.  Jurimetrics can be considered from different perspectives depending on one's focus.

== Jurimetrics and the Law and Economics school ==

The basic difference between jurimetrics and [[Law and Economics]] is simply the fact that jurimetrics simultaneously encompasses [[statistics]] and [[law]], while [[Law and Economics]] deals with [[econometrics]] ([[economics]] and [[statistics]]). When [[statistics]], [[law]] and [[economics]] all coincide, either a jurimetric or an econometric approach may be considered.

With the issue of supplying water to a very large population, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] developed hydraulic systems for multiple applications: public water supply, power using water mills, [[hydraulic mining]], fish tanks, irrigation, fire fighting, and of course [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] (Stein 2004). Scientists such as [[Ctesibius]] and [[Archimedes]] produced the first inventions involving hydraulic power (Oleson 1984). 

==Specific technology==
The most prevalent hydraulic pump used in maritime situations in [[ancient Rome]] was the [[bilge pump]], which functioned to siphon collected water out of a ship’s hull (Oleson 1984). The bilge pump was an improvement on the first hydraulic pumps used in antiquity: force pumps. Invented around the early 3rd century BCE, the most primitive design of a force pump consisted of a piston pushing water out of a tube, constructed by soldering individual bronze elements (Stein 246). 

Written accounts from Phil of Byzantium (late 3rd century BCE), Vitruvius (c. 25 BCE), and Hero of Alexandria (c. CE 50) confirm archaeological evidence for the original simple design, and both Hero and Vitruvius specify that the pump was typically made of bronze (Stein 2004). Somewhere along the way a new design arose that involved cutting apertures into an individual wood block and then rendering the block pressure-proof with tightly fitting plugs and plates (Stein 2004). 

Although cheaper and easier to manufacture, assemble, and repair, the wooden pumps manufactured from then on would most likely not have been durable enough for maritime use, which is why we usually find lead pipes associated with bilge pumps, bilge wells, and hydraulic devices of other function about ships. The amphora shipwreck discovered at Grado in Gorizia, Italy, which dates to around 200 CE, and contained what archaeologists hypothesized to be a ‘hydraulics’ system to change the water in live fish tanks, since other evidence indicates the ship’s involvement in the processed fish trade (Beltrame and Gaddi 2005).  

This hypothesis has been disputed, since the wooden box protecting a lead pipe along the longitudinal axis of the hull found on the wreck suggest the existence of a bilge well (Oleson and Stein 2007). Previous ships involved in live fish tank transport, entitled navis vivariae, did not employ a hydraulic system, and for this reason the hypothesis proves especially questionable (Boetto 124). For example, one of the wrecks found in Claudius’s harbor at the modern Fiumicino Airport in Italy was a small fish craft dating somewhere around the 2nd century CE. Archaeologists discovered a fish-well in the middle of the ship that used the hole/plump system bored in the bottom of the boat to fill the tank (Boetto 2006). Other than the Grado wreck no other evidence exists of hydraulic systems being used in the fish industry.

A '''micrometeoroid''' is a tiny [[meteoroid]]; a small particle of rock in space, usually weighing less than a [[gram]]. A [[micrometeorite]] is such a particle that survives passage through the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] and reaches the Earth's surface.

== Scientific interest ==
{{see also|Cosmic dust}}

Micrometeoroids are very small pieces of rock or metal broken off from larger chunks of rock and debris often dating back to the birth of the [[Solar System]]. Micrometeoroids are extremely common in space. Tiny particles are a major contributor to [[space weathering]] processes. When they hit the surface of the [[Moon]], or any airless body ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], the [[asteroid]]s, etc.), the resulting melting and vaporization causes darkening and other optical changes in the [[regolith]]. In order to understand the micrometeoroid population better, a number of spacecraft (including [[Lunar Orbiter 1]], [[Luna 3]], [[Mars 1]] and [[Pioneer 5]]) have carried micrometeoroid detectors.

In 1957 Hans Peterson conducted one of the first direct measurements of the fall of space dust on the [[Earth]], estimating it to be 14,300,000 tons per year.&lt;ref&gt;Pettersson, Hans. "Cosmic Spherules and Meteoritic Dust." ''Scientific American'', Volume 202 Issue 2, February 1960, pp. 123–132.&lt;/ref&gt; If this were true, then the Moon would be covered to a very great depth as there are limited forms of erosion to remove this material. In 1961 [[Arthur C. Clarke]] popularized this possibility in his novel ''[[A Fall of Moondust]]''. This was cause for some concern among the groups attempting to land on the Moon, so a series of new studies followed to better characterize the issue. This included the launch of several spacecraft designed to directly measure the micrometeorite flux ([[Pegasus satellite program]]) or directly measure the dust on the surface of the Moon ([[Surveyor Program]]). These showed that the flux was much lower than earlier estimates, around 10,000 to 20,000 tons per year, and that the surface of the Moon is relatively rocky.&lt;ref&gt;Snelling, Andrew and David Rush. [http://static.icr.org/i/pdf/technical/Moon-Dust-and-the-Age-of-the-Solar-System.pdf "Moon Dust and the Age of the Solar System."] ''Creation Ex-Nihilo Technical Journal'', Volume 7, Number 1, 1993, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; Most lunar samples returned during the [[Apollo Program]] have micrometeorite impacts marks, typically called "zap pits", on their upper surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Micrometeoroids have less stable [[orbit]]s than meteoroids, due to their greater [[surface area]] to [[mass]] ratio. Micrometeoroids that fall to Earth can provide information on millimeter scale heating events in the [[solar nebula]]. [[Meteorites]] and [[micrometeorites]] (as they are known upon arrival at the Earth's surface) can only be collected in areas where there is no terrestrial [[sedimentation]], typically polar regions. Ice is collected and then melted and filtered so the micrometeorites can be extracted under a microscope.

Sufficiently small micrometeoroids avoid significant heating on entry into the [[Earth's atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Fraundorf (1980) The distribution of temperature maxima for micrometeorites decelerated in the Earth's atmosphere without melting ''Geophys. Res. Lett.'' '''10''':765-768.&lt;/ref&gt; Collection of such particles by high flying aircraft began in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;D. E. Brownlee, D. A. Tomandl and E. Olszewski (1977) Interplanetary dust: A new source of extraterrestrial material for laboratory studies, ''Proc. Lunar Sci. Conf. '''8th''':149-160.&lt;/ref&gt; since which time these samples of stratosphere-collected [[Interplanetary dust cloud#Collecting interplanetary dust on earth|interplanetary dust]] (called ''Brownlee particles'' before their extraterrestrial origin was confirmed) have become an important component of the [[extraterrestrial materials]] available for study in laboratories on Earth.

==Effect on spacecraft operations==
{{see also|Space debris}}
[[File:SMM panel hole.jpg|thumb|Electron micrograph image of an orbital debris hole made in the panel of the [[Solar Maximum Mission|Solar Max]] satellite.]]
Micrometeoroids pose a significant threat to [[space exploration]]. The average velocity of micrometeoroids relative to a [[spacecraft]] in orbit is 10 kilometers per second (22,500&amp;nbsp;mph). Resistance to micrometeoroid impact is a significant design challenge for spacecraft and [[space suit]] designers (''See [[Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment]]''). While the tiny sizes of most micrometeoroids limits the damage incurred, the high velocity impacts will constantly degrade the outer casing of spacecraft in a manner analogous to [[sandblasting]]. Long term exposure can threaten the functionality of spacecraft systems.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/wstf/laboratories/hypervelocity/mmod.html|title=Micrometeoroids and Orbital Debris (MMOD)|last=Rodriguez|first=Karen|date=April 26, 2010|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Impacts by small objects with extremely high velocity (10 kilometers per second) are a current area of research in [[terminal ballistics]]. (Accelerating objects up to such velocities is difficult; current techniques include [[linear motor]]s and [[shaped charge]]s.) The risk is especially high for objects in space for long periods of time, such as [[satellites]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They also pose major engineering challenges in theoretical low-cost lift systems such as [[Tether propulsion|rotovators]], [[space elevator]]s, and orbital airships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Space Elevators: An Assessment of the Technological Feasibility and the Way Forward|last = Swan, Raitt, Swan, Penny, Knapman|first = Peter A., David I., Cathy W., Robert E., John M.|publisher = International Academy of Astronautics|year = 2013|isbn = 9782917761311|location = Virginia, USA|pages = 10–11, 207–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swan, P., Penny, R.

The '''monsoon of South Asia''' is among several geographically distributed [[monsoon|global monsoon]]s. It affects the [[Indian subcontinent]], where it is one of the oldest and most anticipated [[weather]] phenomena and an economically important pattern every year from June through September, but it is only partly understood and notoriously difficult to predict. Several theories have been proposed to explain the origin, process, strength, variability, distribution, and general vagaries of the monsoon, but understanding and predictability are still evolving.

The unique [[Geography of India|geographical features of the Indian subcontinent]], along with associated [[atmospheric]], [[ocean]]ic, and [[geophysical]] factors, influence the behavior of the monsoon. Because of its effect on [[agriculture]], on [[flora and fauna]], and on the climates of nations such as [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Sri Lanka]] — among other [[economic]], [[social]], and [[Natural environment|environmental]] effects — the monsoon is one of the most anticipated, tracked,&lt;ref name="Frater2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Frater|title=Chasing the Monsoon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5I7AAme3yfUC|accessdate=2 March 2011|date=1 May 2005|publisher=Picador|isbn=978-0-330-43313-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studied weather phenomena in the region.

==Definition==
The word ''monsoon'' (derived from the Arabic "mausam," meaning "season"), although generally defined as a system of [[winds]] characterized by a seasonal reversal of direction,&lt;ref name=AMS/&gt; lacks a consistent, detailed definition. Some examples are:

* The [[American Meteorological Society]] calls it a name for seasonal winds, first applied to the winds blowing over the [[Arabian Sea]] from the northeast for six months and from the southwest for six months.&lt;ref name=AMS&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=monsoon&amp;submit=Search|title=Monsoon|accessdate=2008-03-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322122025/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=monsoon&amp;submit=Search|archivedate=22 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has since been extended to similar winds in other parts of the world.
* The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) describes a monsoon as a tropical and subtropical seasonal reversal in both surface winds and associated [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], caused by differential heating between a continental-scale land mass and the adjacent ocean.&lt;ref name=IPCCdef&gt;{{cite web|title=IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007, Glossary|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/annex1sglossary-e-o.html|publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Indian Meteorological Department]] defines it as the seasonal reversal of the direction of winds along the shores of the [[Indian Ocean]], especially in the Arabian Sea, which blow from the southwest for half of the year and from the northeast for the other half.&lt;ref name=IMDdef&gt;{{cite web|title=IMD terminologies &amp; glossary|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/Met_Glossary.htm|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Colin Stokes Ramage, in ''Monsoon Meteorology'', defines the monsoon as a seasonal reversing wind accompanied by corresponding changes in precipitation.&lt;ref name="Ramage1971"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin S.

Observed initially by sailors in the Arabian Sea&lt;ref name="Selin1997"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Helaine Selin|editor-link=Helaine Selin|title=Encyclopaedia of the history of science, technology, and medicine in non-western cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raKRY3KQspsC&amp;pg=PA766|accessdate=3 March 2011|year=1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-4066-9|pages=766–}}&lt;/ref&gt; traveling between [[Africa]], [[India]], and [[Southeast Asia]], the monsoon can be categorized into two ''branches'' based on their spread over the subcontinent:
* Arabian Sea branch
* [[Bay of Bengal]] branch
[[File:Monsoon season beach Tamil Nadu India.jpg|thumb|200px|Southwest monsoon clouds over [[Tamil Nadu]].]]
Alternatively, it can be categorized into two ''segments'' based on the direction of rain-bearing winds:
* Southwest (SW) monsoon 
* Northeast (NE) monsoon&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The name of the wind is based on the direction that it blows ''from''. Southwest winds blow onto the land from the southwest. Northeast winds flow from the northeast toward the southwest, onto the land.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the time of year that these winds bring rain to India, the monsoon can also be categorized into two ''periods'':
* Summer monsoon (May to September)
* Winter monsoon (October to November)

The complexity of the monsoon of South Asia is not completely understood, making it difficult to accurately predict the quantity, timing, and geographic distribution of the accompanying precipitation. These are the most monitored components of the monsoon, and they determine the water availability in India for any given year.&lt;ref name=IMD1/&gt;

==Changes of the Monsoon==

{{Main article|Monsoon#South Asian Monsoon}}

[[File:Aug2011monsoon.JPG|Monsoon over India|thumb|350px]]
Monsoons typically occur in tropical areas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Class 9 CBSE Geography Climate The Mechanism of Monsoons - Wiki|url = http://www.learnnext.com/nextgurukul/wiki/concept/CBSE/IX/Geography/The-Mechanism-of-Monsoons.htm|website = www.learnnext.com|access-date = 2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; One area that monsoons impact greatly is India.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In India monsoons create an entire season in which the winds reverse completely.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Various atmospheric conditions influence the monsoon winds. The first condition is the differential heating and cooling of land and water. This creates low pressure on the landmass, while high pressure is created over the seas during daytime, but is reversed during the night time.

The second condition is the shift in the position of [[Intertropical Convergence Zone|Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ). In summer, the equatorial trough normally positioned about 5°N of the equator moves over the Ganga plain creating a monsoon trough during the monsoon season.

The third condition is the presence of the high-pressure area that develops east of Madagascar. It is approximately at 20°S over the Indian Ocean. The intensity and position of this high-pressure area affects the Indian Monsoon.

The fourth condition develops during the summer. The Tibetan Plateau gets intensely heated resulting in strong vertical air currents and high pressure over the plateau about 9&amp;nbsp;km above sea level. The fifth condition develops during the summer due to the movement of the westerly jet streams to the north of the Himalayas and the presence of the tropical easterly jet stream over the Indian Peninsula.

Changes in pressure over the southern oceans also affect the monsoons. In certain years, there is a reversal in the pressure conditions. This periodic change in pressure conditions is known as the Southern Oscillation, or SO.

The Southern Oscillation is connected to la nina, which is a warm ocean current that flows past the Peruvian Coast. It flows every two to five years in place of the cold Peruvian current. The phenomenon is, referred to as ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillations). In India, the monsoon lasts for 100 to 120 days from early June and to mid-September. The monsoon winds encounter various atmospheric conditions on their way and hence are pulsating in nature, and not steady.

The monsoon arrives with a sudden downpour of rainfall that continues for several days. This is known as the ‘burst’ of the monsoon.

The rainfall is a result of the convergence of wind flow from the [[Bay of Bengal]] and reverse winds from the [[South China Sea]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/onset onset] of the monsoon occurs over the [[Bay of Bengal]] in May,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Characteristics, evolution and mechanisms of the summer monsoon onset over Southeast Asia|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.1082/abstract|journal = International Journal of Climatology|date = 2004-10-01|issn = 1097-0088|pages = 1461–1482|volume = 24|issue = 12|doi = 10.1002/joc.1082|language = en|first = Zuqiang|last = Zhang|first2 = Johnny C.

By mid-October, it withdraws completely from the northern half of the peninsula. The withdrawal takes place progressively from north to south from the first week of December to the first week of January. This is the start of the winter season.

The retreating monsoon winds move over the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, and collect moisture on the way. These monsoon winds reach the southern states of India by October, and are responsible for a second round of rainfall. These are called the winter monsoons. The winter monsoon is experienced in the states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh in the first week of January.

===Effect of geographical relief features===
Although the southwest and northeast monsoon winds are seasonally reversible, they do not cause precipitation on their own.
{{Main article|Rain#Formation}}
Two factors are essential for [[Rain#Formation|rain formation]]:
# [[Rain#Water-saturated air|Moisture-laden winds]]
# [[Rain#Coalescence|Droplet formation]]

Additionally, one of the [[Rain#Causes|causes of rain]] must happen. In the case of the monsoon, the cause is primarily [[Rain#Orographic effects|orographic]], due to the presence of highlands in the path of the winds. Orographic barriers force wind to rise. Precipitation then occurs on the windward side of the highlands because of [[Adiabatic process#Adiabatic heating and cooling|adiabatic cooling]] and condensation of the moist rising air.
{{Main article|Orographic lift}}

The unique [[Geography of India|geographic relief]] features of the Indian subcontinent come into play in allowing all of the above factors to occur simultaneously. The relevant features in explaining the monsoon mechanism are as follows:
# The presence of abundant water bodies around the subcontinent: the [[Arabian Sea]], [[Bay of Bengal]], and [[Indian Ocean]]. These help moisture accumulate in the winds during the hot season.
# The presence of abundant highlands like the [[Western Ghats]] and the [[Himalayas]] right across the path of the southwest monsoon winds. These are the main cause of the substantial [[Orographic lift#Precipitation|orographic precipitation]] throughout the subcontinent.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The [[Aravalli Range|Aravalli]] Mountains also lie in the path of the southwest monsoon but do not result in much precipitation because they are in the direction of the path of the southwest winds and not ''across'' them, causing no [[orographic lift]] of the winds.&lt;/ref&gt;
## The Western Ghats are the first highlands of India that the southwest monsoon winds encounter.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Other major highlands, like the [[Cardamom Hills]], [[Anaimalai Hills]], and [[Nilgiri Mountains]], that play active roles in the monsoon are considered major extensions of the Western Ghats and are thus not discussed separately.&lt;/ref&gt; The Western Ghats rise abruptly from the [[Western Coastal Plains]] of the subcontinent, making effective orographic barriers for the monsoon winds.
## The Himalayas play more than the role of orographic barriers for the monsoon. They also help confine it to the subcontinent. Without them, the southwest monsoon winds would blow right over the Indian subcontinent into [[Tibet]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Russia]] without causing any rain.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;First, the Himalayas serve as orographic barriers to the southwest monsoon winds. Second, they help confine the winds to the subcontinent, hampering their northward progress. Third, they contribute to the convergence of the Bay of Bengal branch and Arabian Sea branch of the southwest monsoon winds, increasing the intensity of precipitation over the northern part of the subcontinent. Fourth, they are a major factor in the ''bursting'' of the monsoon under the jet stream theory. Fifth, they help determine the direction of the Bay of Bengal branch of the northeast monsoon. Their role is still a matter of active study, and understanding of them is evolving regularly.&lt;/ref&gt;
## For the northeast monsoon, the highlands of the [[Eastern Ghats]] play the role of orographic barrier.

==Features of monsoon rains==
There are some unique features of the rains that the monsoon brings to the Indian subcontinent.

===''"Bursting"''===
[[File:Mumbai india monsoon clouds.jpg|thumb|220px|"Monsoon burst" over [[Mumbai]].]]
''Bursting of monsoon'' refers to the sudden change in weather conditions in India (typically from hot and dry weather to wet and humid weather during the southwest monsoon), characterized by an abrupt rise in the mean daily rainfall.&lt;ref name="Allaby2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Allaby|title=Encyclopedia of weather and climate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J1wq-9OSCscC&amp;pg=PA373|accessdate=3 March 2011|year=2002|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-4801-4|pages=373–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanif2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=M.

===Rain variability (''"vagaries"'')===
One of the most commonly used words to describe the erratic nature of the monsoon is "vagaries," used in newspapers,&lt;ref name=IEvag&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasabe|first=Nanda Dabhole|title=Vagaries apart, monsoon is normal|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/19970723/20450243.html|accessdate=5 March 2011|newspaper=the Indian Express|date=23 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; magazines,&lt;ref name="Darpan2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Pratiyogita Darpan]]|title=Pratiyogita Darpan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xOgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT93|accessdate=5 March 2011|date=October 2007|publisher=Pratiyogita Darpan|pages=93–}}&lt;/ref&gt; books,&lt;ref name="Krishnamacharyulu2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Krishnamacharyulu|title=Cases In Rural Marketing: An Integrated Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4_mXbVC4bwC&amp;pg=PA106|accessdate=5 March 2011|date=1 September 2003|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=978-81-317-0188-1|pages=106–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[web portal]]s&lt;ref name=IWP&gt;{{cite web|title=Agronomic Measures in Dryland Agriculture: An Overview|url=http://www.indiawaterportal.org/node/6979|publisher=India Water Portal|accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[insurance]] plans,&lt;ref name=FT1&gt;{{cite news|title=Weather Insurance To Protect A Few|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/printer/news/110251/|accessdate=5 March 2011|newspaper=Financial Express|date=16 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and India's budget discussions.&lt;ref name=MI1&gt;{{cite news|title=Budget must focus on Growth, Food Inflation, FDI, Govt B/s: G Chokkalingam|url=http://www.myiris.com/newsCentre/storyShow.php?fileR=20110222154315043&amp;dir=2011/02/22&amp;secID=livenews|accessdate=5 March 2011|newspaper=myIris.com|date=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In some years, it rains too much, causing floods in parts of India; in others, it rains too little or not at all, causing droughts. In some years, the rain quantity is sufficient but its timing arbitrary. Sometimes, despite average annual rainfall, the daily distribution or geographic distribution of the rain is substantially skewed. In the recent past, rainfall variability in short time periods (about a week) were attributed to desert dust over the Arabian Sea and [[Western Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v7/n4/full/ngeo2107.html|title=Short-term modulation of Indian summer monsoon rainfall by West Asian dust|first1=V.|last1=Vinoj|first2=Philip J.|last2=Rasch|first3=Hailong|last3=Wang|first4=Jin-Ho|last4=Yoon|first5=Po-Lun|last5=Ma|first6=Kiranmayi|last6=Landu|first7=Balwinder|last7=Singh|date=|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=7|issue=4|pages=308–313|accessdate=20 April 2018|doi=10.1038/ngeo2107|bibcode=2014NatGe...7..308V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideal and normal monsoon rains==
[[File:India annual rainfall map en.svg|thumb|200px|Annual average rainfall in India.]]

Normally, the southwest monsoon can be expected to "burst" onto the western coast of India (near [[Thiruvananthapuram]]) at the beginning of June and to cover the entire country by mid-July.&lt;ref name=IMD1&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Meteorological Department|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/Monsoon_frame.htm|publisher=imd.gov.in|accessdate=3 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224191959/http://imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/Monsoon_frame.htm|archivedate=24 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMDMOK&gt;{{cite web|title=SW Monsoon Normal Onset Dates|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/MOK.htm|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMDjpg&gt;{{cite web|title=Monsoon Onset dates on Map of India|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/newnormalonset.jpg|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its withdrawal from India typically starts at the beginning of September and finishes by the beginning of October.&lt;ref name=IMDwith&gt;{{cite web|title=SW Monsoon Normal Withdrawal Dates|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/withdrawal_criteria.htm|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMDwithjpg&gt;{{cite web|title=Monsoon withdrawal dates on Map of India|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/withdrawal_normal.jpg|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northeast monsoon usually "bursts" around 20 October and lasts for about 50 days before withdrawing.&lt;ref name="Wang2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bin Wang|title=The Asian monsoon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRT57TENzT8C&amp;pg=PA188|accessdate=3 March 2011|year=2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-40610-5|pages=188–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a rainy monsoon is not necessarily a normal monsoon — that is, one that performs close to [[statistical average]]s calculated over a long period. A normal monsoon is generally accepted to be one involving close to the ''average quantity'' of precipitation over all the geographical locations under its influence (''mean spatial distribution'') and over the entire expected time period (''mean temporal distribution''). Additionally, the ''arrival date'' and the ''departure date'' of both the southwest and northeast monsoon should be close to the mean dates. The exact criteria for a normal monsoon are defined by the [[Indian Meteorological Department]] with calculations for the mean and standard deviation of each of these variables.&lt;ref name=IMDavgMonsoon&gt;{{cite web|title=Met. Terminologies and Glossary - Monsoon|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/Met_Glossary.htm|publisher=[[Indian Meteorological Department]]|accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
A monsoon with excess rain can cause floods, and one with too little rain can lead to widespread drought, [[famine]], and economic losses. Therefore, a normal monsoon with mean performance is the most desirable monsoon.

==Theories for mechanism of monsoon==
Theories of the mechanism of the monsoon primarily try to explain the reasons for the seasonal reversal of winds and the timing of their reversal.

===Traditional theory===
{{Main article|Sea breeze}}
Because of differences in the [[specific heat capacity]] of land and water, [[continents]] heat up faster than [[sea]]s. Consequently, the [[air]] above [[coast]]al lands heats up faster than the air above seas. These create areas of low air pressure above coastal lands compared with pressure over the seas, causing winds to flow from the seas onto the neighboring lands. This is known as [[sea breeze]].

====Process of monsoon creation====
{{Main article|Monsoon#Process}}
[[File:Diagrama de formacion de la brisa-breeze.svg|thumb|200px|A: sea breeze; B: land breeze.]]
Also known as the ''thermal theory'' or the ''differential heating of sea and land theory'', the traditional theory portrays the monsoon as a large-scale [[sea breeze]]. It states that during the hot subtropical summers, the massive [[landmass]] of the [[Indian Peninsula]] heats up at a different rate than the surrounding seas, resulting in a [[pressure gradient]] from south to north. This causes the flow of moisture-laden winds from sea to land. On reaching land, these winds rise because of the geographical relief, cooling [[Adiabatic process#Adiabatic heating and cooling|adiabatically]] and leading to orographic rains. This is the ''southwest monsoon''.
The reverse happens during the winter, when the land is colder than the sea, establishing a pressure gradient from land to sea. This causes the winds to blow over the Indian subcontinent toward the [[Indian Ocean]] in a northeasterly direction, causing the ''northeast monsoon''. Because the southwest monsoon flows from sea to land, it carries more moisture, and therefore causes more rain, than the northeast monsoon. Only part of the northeast monsoon passing over the Bay of Bengal picks up moisture, causing rain in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] during the winter months.

However, many meteorologists argue that the monsoon is not a local phenomenon as explained by the traditional theory, but a general weather phenomenon along the entire [[Tropics|tropical zone]] of [[Earth]]. This criticism does not deny the role of differential heating of sea and land in generating monsoon winds, but casts it as one of several factors rather than the only one.

===Dynamic theory===
[[File:Earth Global Circulation.svg|thumb|300px|The atmospheric circulation system with associated pressure belts and latitudes.]]
{{Main article|Prevailing winds}}
{{Main article|Atmospheric circulation}}
The [[prevailing winds]] of the [[atmospheric circulation]] arise because of the difference in pressure at various [[latitudes]] and act as means for distribution of [[thermal energy]] on the planet. This pressure difference is because of the differences in [[solar insolation]] received at different latitudes and the resulting uneven heating of the [[planet]]. Alternating belts of high pressure and low pressure develop along the [[equator]], the two [[tropics]], the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] circles, and the two [[polar region]]s, giving rise to the [[trade wind]]s, the [[westerlies]], and the [[polar easterlies]]. However, geophysical factors like [[Earth's orbit]], its rotation, and its [[axial tilt]] cause these belts to shift gradually north and south, following the [[Sun]]'s seasonal shifts.

====Process of monsoon creation====
The ''dynamic theory'' explains the monsoon on the basis of the annual shifts in the position of global belts of pressure and winds. According to this theory, the monsoon is a result of the shift of the [[Inter Tropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ) under the influence of the [[Solar equator|vertical sun]]. Though the mean position of the ITCZ is taken as the equator, it shifts north and south with the migration of the vertical sun toward the Tropics of [[Tropic of Cancer|Cancer]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn|Capricorn]] during the [[summer]] of the respective hemispheres ([[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]] and [[Southern Hemisphere]]). As such, during the northern summer (May and June), the ITCZ moves north, along with the vertical sun, toward the Tropic of Cancer. The ITCZ, as the zone of lowest pressure in the tropical region, is the target destination for the [[trade wind]]s of both hemispheres. Consequently, with the ITCZ at the Tropic of Cancer, the southeast trade winds of the Southern Hemisphere have to cross the equator to reach it.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;When the southeast trade winds cross the equator, they are perceived in the Northern Hemisphere as equatorial westerlies because they seem to blow from the equator toward the Tropic Of Cancer. Similarly, when the ITCZ is at the Tropic of Cancer, the northeast trade winds are confined to the area north of the Tropic of Cancer.&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of the [[Coriolis effect]] (which causes winds in the Northern Hemisphere to turn right, whereas winds in the Southern Hemisphere turn left), these southeast trade winds are deflected east in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], transforming into southwest trades.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Change of direction or origin of winds alters their nomenclature as noted above.&lt;/ref&gt; These pick up moisture while traveling from sea to land and cause orographic rain once they hit the highlands of the Indian Peninsula. This results in the southwest monsoon.

The dynamic theory explains the monsoon as a global weather phenomenon rather than just a local one. And when coupled with the traditional theory (based on the heating of sea and land), it enhances the explanation of the varying intensity of monsoon precipitation along the coastal regions with orographic barriers.

===Jet stream theory===
{{Main article|Jet stream}}
[[File:Jetcrosssection.jpg|thumb|300px|Jet streams of Earth]]
This theory tries to explain the establishment of the northeast and southwest monsoons, as well as unique features like "bursting" and variability.

The jet streams are systems of upper-air westerlies. They give rise to slowly moving upper-air waves, with 250-[[knots|knot]] winds in some air streams. First observed by [[World War II]] pilots, they develop just below the [[tropopause]] over areas of steep pressure gradient on the surface. The main types are the ''polar jets'', the ''subtropical westerly jets'', and the less common ''tropical easterly jets''. They follow the principle of [[geostrophic wind]]s.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Geostrophic winds blow parallel to the [[Contour line#Barometric pressure|isobars]] and keep low-pressure zones to their left in the Northern Hemisphere and to their right in the Southern Hemisphere. The reversal is a result of the [[Coriolis effect]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Process of monsoon creation====
[[File:Tibet Karte Topograpisch.png|thumb|250px|The [[Tibetan Plateau]] lies north of the [[Himalayas]].]]
Over India, a subtropical westerly jet develops in the winter season and is replaced by the tropical easterly jet in the summer season. The high temperature during the summer over the [[Tibetan Plateau]], as well as over [[Central Asia]] in general, is believed to be the critical factor leading to the formation of the tropical easterly jet over India.

The mechanism affecting the monsoon is that the westerly jet causes high pressure over northern parts of the subcontinent during the winter. This results in the north-to-south flow of the winds in the form of the northeast monsoon. With the northward shift of the vertical sun, this jet shifts north, too. The intense heat over the Tibetan Plateau, coupled with associated [[terrain]] features like the high altitude of the plateau, generate the tropical easterly jet over central India. This jet creates a low-pressure zone over the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|northern Indian plains]], influencing the wind flow toward these plains and assisting the development of the southwest monsoon{{Clarify|date=March 2018}}.

==Theories for "bursting"==
The "bursting"&lt;ref name=Allaby2002/&gt; of the monsoon is primarily explained by the jet stream theory and the dynamic theory.

===Dynamic theory===
According to this theory, during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere, the ITCZ shifts north, pulling the southwest monsoon winds onto the land from the sea. However, the huge landmass of the Himalayas restricts the low-pressure zone onto the Himalayas themselves. It is only when the Tibetan Plateau heats up significantly more than the Himalayas that the ITCZ abruptly and swiftly shifts north, leading to the bursting of monsoon rains over the Indian subcontinent.
The reverse shift takes place for the northeast monsoon winds, leading to a second, minor burst of rainfall over the eastern Indian Peninsula during the Northern Hemisphere winter months.

===Jet stream theory===
According to this theory, the onset of the southwest monsoon is driven by the shift of the subtropical westerly jet north from over the plains of India toward the Tibetan Plateau. This shift is due to the intense heating of the plateau during the summer months. The northward shift is not a slow and gradual process, as expected for most changes in weather pattern. The primary cause is believed to be the height of the Himalayas. As the Tibetan Plateau heats up, the low pressure created over it pulls the westerly jet north. Because of the lofty Himalayas, the westerly jet's movement is inhibited. But with continuous dropping pressure, sufficient force is created for the movement of the westerly jet across the Himalayas after a significant period. As such, the shift of the jet is sudden and abrupt, causing the bursting of southwest monsoon rains onto the Indian plains. The reverse shift happens for the northeast monsoon.

==Theories for monsoon variability==

===The jet stream effect===
The jet stream theory also explains the variability in timing and strength of the monsoon.

'''Timing:''' A timely northward shift of the subtropical westerly jet at the beginning of summer is critical to the onset of the southwest monsoon over India. If the shift is delayed, so is the southwest monsoon. An early shift results in an early monsoon.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Strength:''' The strength of the southwest monsoon is determined by the strength of the easterly tropical jet over central India. A strong easterly tropical jet results in a strong southwest monsoon over central India, and a weak jet results in a weak monsoon.

===El Niño-Southern Oscillation effect===
{{Main article|El Niño-Southern Oscillation}}
[[File:El Nino regional impacts.png|thumb|righ|300px|Effects of [[El Niño]] on the weather of the subcontinent.]]
[[El nino|''El Niño'']] is a warm ocean current originating along the coast of [[Peru]] that replaces the usual cold [[Humboldt Current]]. The warm surface water moving toward the coast of Peru with El Niño is pushed west by the trade winds, thereby raising the temperature of the southern Pacific Ocean. The reverse condition is known as [[La Niña]].

''Southern oscillation'', a phenomenon first observed by [[Gilbert Walker|Sir Gilbert Thomas Walker]], director general of observatories in India, refers to the seesaw relationship of atmospheric pressures between [[Tahiti]] and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Australia.&lt;ref name=IODhindu&gt;{{cite news|last=Gopal Raj|first=N|title=El Nino &amp; the Indian Ocean Dipole|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2004050401861000.htm&amp;date=2004/05/04/&amp;prd=th&amp;|accessdate=5 March 2011|newspaper=The Hindu|date=4 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker noticed that when pressure was high in Tahiti, it was low in Darwin, and [[List of Latin phrases: V#vice versa|vice versa]].&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt;  A ''Southern Oscillation Index'' (SOI), based on the pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin, has been formulated by the [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)]] to measure the strength of the oscillation.&lt;ref name="Aus"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|title=Climate glossary - Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/glossary/soi.shtml|date=3 April 2007|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker noticed that the quantity of rainfall in the Indian subcontinent was often negligible in years of high pressure over Darwin (and low pressure over Tahiti). Conversely, low pressure over Darwin bodes well for precipitation quantity in India. Thus, Walker established the relationship between southern oscillation and quantities of monsoon rains in India.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt;

Ultimately, the southern oscillation was found to be simply an atmospheric component of the El Niño/La Niña effect, which happens in the ocean.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; Therefore, in the context of the monsoon, the two together came to be known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effect. The effect is known to have a pronounced influence on the strength of the southwest monsoon over India, with the monsoon being weak (causing droughts) during El Niño years, while La Niña years bring particularly strong monsoons.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt;

===Indian Ocean dipole effect===
{{Main article|Indian Ocean Dipole}}
Although the ENSO effect was statistically effective in explaining several past droughts in India, in recent decades, its relationship with the Indian monsoon seemed to weaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumar|first=K. K.|author2=Balaji Rajagopalan |author3=Mark A. Cane |title=On the Weakening Relationship Between the Indian Monsoon and ENSO|journal=Science|date=25 June 1999|volume=284|issue=5423|pages=2156–2159|doi=10.1126/science.284.5423.2156|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/284/5423/2156.abstract|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the strong ENSO of 1997 did not cause drought in India.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; However, it was later discovered that, just like ENSO in the Pacific Ocean, a similar seesaw ocean-atmosphere system in the [[Indian Ocean]] was also in play. This system was discovered in 1999 and named the [[Indian Ocean Dipole]] (IOD). An index to calculate it was also formulated. IOD develops in the equatorial region of the Indian Ocean from April to May and peaks in October.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; With a positive IOD, winds over the Indian Ocean blow from east to west. This makes the Arabian Sea (the western Indian Ocean near the African coast) much warmer and the eastern Indian Ocean around Indonesia colder and drier.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; In negative dipole years, the reverse happens, making Indonesia much warmer and rainier.

A positive IOD index often negates the effect of ENSO, resulting in increased monsoon rains in years such as 1983, 1994, and 1997.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; Further, the two poles of the IOD — the eastern pole (around Indonesia) and the western pole (off the African coast) — independently and cumulatively affect the quantity of monsoon rains.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt;

====Equatorial Indian Ocean oscillation====
As with ENSO, the atmospheric component of the IOD was later discovered and the cumulative phenomenon named ''Equatorial Indian Ocean oscillation'' (EQUINOO).&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; When EQUINOO effects are factored in, certain failed forecasts, like the acute drought of 2002, can be further accounted for.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; The relationship between extremes of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall, along with ENSO and EQUINOO,&lt;ref name=EQgadgil&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gadgil|first=Sulochana|author2=P.

==Impact of climate change on the monsoon==

Since 1950s, the South Asian summer monsoon underwent a gradual decline, with a reduction of up to 10% over central India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roxy|first=Mathew Koll|last2=Ritika|first2=Kapoor|last3=Terray|first3=Pascal|last4=Murtugudde|first4=Raghu|last5=Ashok|first5=Karumuri|last6=Goswami|first6=B.

Since the strength of the monsoon is partially dependent on the temperature difference between the ocean and the land, higher ocean temperatures in the Indian Ocean have weakened the moisture bearing winds from the ocean to the land. The reduction in the summer monsoon rainfall have grave consequences over central India because at least 60% of the agriculture in this region is still largely [[Rainfed agriculture|rain-fed]]. 

A recent assessment of the monsoonal changes indicate that the land warming has increased during 2002-2014, possibly reviving the strength of the monsoon circulation and rainfall&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roxy|first=Mathew Koll|date=|title=Land warming revives monsoon|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nclimate3356|journal=Nature Climate Change|volume=7|issue=8|pages=549–550|doi=10.1038/nclimate3356|via=|bibcode=2017NatCC...7..549R}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Future changes in the monsoon will depend on a competition between land and ocean—on which is warming faster than the other.

Meanwhile, there has been a three-fold rise in widespread extreme rainfall events during the years 1950 to 2015, over the entire central belt of India, leading to a steady rise in the number of flash floods with significant socioeconomic losses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roxy|first=M.

Widespread extreme rainfall events are those rainfall events which are larger than 150 mm/day and spread over a region large enough to cause floods.

==Monsoon rain prediction models==
Since the [[Great Famine of 1876–78]] in India, various attempts have been made to predict monsoon rainfall.&lt;ref name=MOL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction|url=http://www.tropmet.res.in/~kolli/mol/Introduction/frameindex.html|publisher=Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, India|accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least five prediction models exist.&lt;ref name="CSgadgil"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gadgil|first=Sulochana|date=10 February 2011|year=|title=Seasonal prediction of the Indian monsoon|url=http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/100/03/0343.pdf|journal=Current Science|series=3|volume=100|pages=343–353|via=|author2=J.

Its position as the sole authority on the monsoon was cemented in 2005&lt;ref name=CSgadgil/&gt; by the [[Department of Science and Technology (India)|Department of Science and Technology (DST)]], [[New Delhi]].

==Significance==
[[File:MatheranPanoramaPointDrySeason.JPG|400px|thumb|[[Western Ghats]],Maharashtra  on 28 May in dry season]]
[[File:MatheranPanoramaPointMonsoon.JPG|400px|thumb|[[Western Ghats]],Maharashtra  on 28 August in rainy season]]

The monsoon is the primary delivery mechanism for [[fresh water]] in the Indian subcontinent. As such, it affects the [[Natural environment|environment]] (and associated flora, fauna, and [[ecosystem]]s), agriculture, society, hydro-power production, and geography of the subcontinent (like the availability of fresh water in water bodies and the underground water table), with all of these factors cumulatively contributing to the health of the economy of affected countries.

The monsoon turns large parts of India from semi-deserts into green grasslands. See photos taken only three months apart in the Western Ghats.

===Geographical (wettest spots on Earth)===
[[Mawsynram]] and [[Cherrapunji]], both in the Indian state of [[Meghalaya]], alternate as the wettest places on Earth given the quantity of their rainfall,&lt;ref name=Wettest&gt;{{cite news|last=Philip|first=A J|title=Cherrapunji no longer wettest Challenge comes from nearby village|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030824/main8.htm|accessdate=9 March 2011|newspaper=The Tribune|date=24 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; though there are other cities with similar claims. They receive more than 11,000 millimeters of rain each from the monsoon.

===Agricultural===
In India, which has historically had a primarily agrarian economy, the [[services sector]] recently overtook the [[farm sector]] in terms of [[GDP]] contribution. However, the [[agriculture]] sector still contributes 17-20% of GDP&lt;ref name=Rediff1&gt;{{cite web|title=How monsoon impacts the Indian economy|url=http://business.rediff.com/slide-show/2010/jun/02/slide-show-1-how-monsoon-impacts-indian-economy.htm|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the largest employer in the country, with about 60% of Indians dependent on it for employment and livelihood.&lt;ref name=Rediff1/&gt; About 49% of India's land is agricultural; that number rises to 55% if associated [[wetlands]], [[dryland farming]] areas, etc., are included. Because more than half of these farmlands are rain-fed, the monsoon is critical to food sufficiency and quality of life.

Despite progress in alternative forms of irrigation, agricultural dependence on the monsoon remains far from insignificant. Therefore, the agricultural calendar of India is governed by the monsoon. Any fluctuations in the time distribution, spatial distribution, or quantity of the monsoon rains may lead to floods or droughts, causing the agricultural sector to suffer. This has a cascading effect on the secondary economic sectors, the overall economy, food inflation, and therefore the general population's quality and cost of living.

===Economic===
The economic significance of the monsoon is aptly described by [[Pranab Mukherjee]]'s remark that the monsoon is the "real finance minister of India".&lt;ref name="HT1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBNlive1/&gt;
A good monsoon results in better agricultural yields, which brings down prices of essential food commodities and reduces imports, thus reducing [[food inflation]] overall.&lt;ref name=Rediff1/&gt; Better rains also result in increased hydroelectric production.&lt;ref name=Rediff1/&gt;
All of these factors have positive ripple effects throughout the economy of India.&lt;ref name=Rediff1/&gt;

The down side however is that when monsoon rains are weak, crop production is low leading to higher food prices with limited supply.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Monsoon affects economy, health in India|url = http://monsoon.yale.edu/monsoon-affects-economy-health-in-india/|website = WORLD MONSOONS|access-date = 2016-02-15|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Indian government is actively working with farmers and the nation's meteorological department to produce more drought resistant crops.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Social===
[[D. Subbarao]], [[List of Governors of the Reserve Bank of India|former governor of the Reserve Bank of India]], emphasized during a quarterly review of India's [[monetary policy]] that the lives of Indians depend on the performance of the monsoon.&lt;ref name=DS&gt;{{cite news|last=IANS|title=All Indians ‘chasing the monsoon’|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/business/all-indians-chasing-the-monsoon_100402650.html|accessdate=2 March 2011|newspaper=Thaindia.com|date=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His own career prospects, his emotional well-being, and the performance of his monetary policy are all "a hostage" to the monsoon, he said, as is the case for most Indians.&lt;ref name=DS/&gt; Additionally, farmers rendered jobless by failed monsoon rains tend to migrate to cities. This crowds city slums and aggravates the infrastructure and sustainability of city life.&lt;ref name=IEtme&gt;{{cite news|last=MITRA|first=SUBHANKAR|title=The monsoon effect|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/the-monsoon-effect/508510/0|accessdate=7 March 2011|newspaper=IndianExpress|date=29 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel===
In the past, Indians usually refrained from traveling during monsoons for practical as well as religious reasons. But with the advent of globalization, such travel is gaining popularity. Places like [[Kerala]] and the Western Ghats get a large number of tourists, both local and foreigners, during the monsoon season. Kerala is one of the top destinations for tourists interested in [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] treatments and massage therapy. One major drawback of traveling during the monsoon is that most wildlife sanctuaries are closed. Also, some mountainous areas, especially in Himalayan regions, get cut off when roads are damaged by landslides and floods during heavy rains.&lt;ref name=ift&gt;{{cite web|title=Traveling in India during monsoons|url=http://indiafoodtour.com/traveling-in-india-during-monsoons|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental===
The monsoon is the primary bearer of fresh water to the area. The [[Geography of South India#Water bodies|peninsular/Deccan rivers of India]] are mostly rain-fed and non-perennial in nature, depending primarily on the monsoon for water supply.&lt;ref name=IG&gt;{{cite web|title=Rivers-Profile-Know India|url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/rivers.php|publisher=India.gov.in|accessdate=6 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204154938/http://india.gov.in/knowindia/rivers.php |archivedate=2011-02-04 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of the [[List of rivers of India#Rivers flowing into Arabian Sea|coastal rivers of Western India]] are also rain-fed and monsoon-dependent.&lt;ref name=IG/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBC&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Geography|url=http://www.indiabook.com/india-information/indian-geography.html|publisher=IndiaBook.com|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the flora, fauna, and entire [[ecosystem]]s of these areas rely heavily on the monsoon. {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

[[File:Wizjalokalna.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Polish book cover]]

'''''Observation on the Spot''''' (Polish ''Wizja lokalna'', with the common meaning of the expression being "crime scene investigation") is a [[social science fiction]] novel by [[Stanisław Lem]]. The novel is a report of [[Ijon Tichy]]'s travel to a faraway planet Entia (in Polish text: Encja) to study their civilization. This report was supposed to fix a misunderstanding arisen from [[The Star Diaries|Tichy's Fourteenth Voyage]] to supposedly Entia (then known as Enteropia), which turned out to be a satellite of Entia,  masqueraded by Entians to misguide explorers. The travel was also to verify the results of the "Institute of Historiographical Computers" (Polish: Instytut Maszyn Dziejowych), which use [[predictive modeling]] to overcome the [[speed of light]] limitation and get information about the state of the affairs on remote planets based on information obtained from previous expeditions.

Major themes of the book are: the problems of the society of abundance based entirely on automated production where individuals have little to do; imposition of ethical laws through technology i.e. the "ethicsphere" which has made it impossible to harm individuals physically; and the ideological opposition of two dominant systems, which is basically a parody of [[Western World]]-[[Soviet Union]] split taken to the absurd.

The original novel was first printed by [[Wydawnictwo Literackie]] in 1982. It was translated into German by Hubert Schumann under the title ''Lokaltermin'' in 1987 ({{ISBN|3-518-37955-0}}).

Lacking English translation, the novel title was also translated in literary criticism works as ''"Eyewitness Account"'' and ''"The Scene of the Crime"''.&lt;ref name=sfs/&gt;

''[[Science Fiction Studies]]'' published a collection of excerpts from Lem's letters which show the chronology of the creation of the novel (during 1979-1981.&lt;ref name=sfs&gt; "On the Genesis of ''Wizja Lokalna''" in: [https://www.depauw.edu/sfs/abstracts/a40.htm Science Fiction Studies #40 = Volume 13, Part 3 = November 1986, Article Abstracts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
Tichy arrives on Entia to discover a unique anthropomorphic civilization divided into two major states: Kurdlandia (from "kurdl") and Luzania. These names require some explanations.

''Kurdl'' is a huge animal inhabiting the marshes of Entia. The name of the animal is Lem's invention, used in earlier tales about Tichy. (In Polish it is ''kurdel'', however in [[declension]]s of the word the [[root (linguistics)|root]] converts into "kurdl-", hence there are no associations with the English word "curdle"). The name "Luzania" derives from the Polish root "luz-" with the meaning of "loose", "not restrained"; the choice will become clear below.

Kurdlandia's guiding ideology is "national mobilism", that is the vast majority of the population must live inside of the stomachs, various passages and internal organs of the kurdls. Kurdls walk about the marshes, guided by drivers, and their inhabitants hence are "able to explore the land of their wonderful country from inside of their home kurdl", in the words of a patriotic individual that Ijon Tichy spoke to. Inhabitants of the kurdls may get out periodically (at least for 24 hours a year). Exceptions are largely confined to high government officials who live outside the marshes, on dry ground, in normal houses. Kurdlandia has no technology to speak of and is proud of it.

The other state, Luzania, constitutes the most significant treatment of the topic of an "ideal state" in Lem (and many would argue, in all science fiction). Their most prominent accomplishment is the creation of "ethicsphere" (compare "atmosphere"). They have produced huge numbers of molecular sized [[nanobots]] called "bystry" ("quickies" in English) that serve to control matter in the 'quickated' areas. The primary function of the 'quickies' is the enforcement of the laws of ethics as physical laws (hence the word ethicsphere). Hence, it is a physical law in Luzania that it is not possible to hurt an individual physically. If you try to strike your neighbor, your hand will be stopped by the suddenly increased air viscosity, (although you will not be hurt either). If you try to drown, the water will push you out. Doing non-physical harm, such as by pestering, criticizing, and otherwise mentally tormenting people is still possible, although in such a case the 'quickies' would probably help the victim to walk away from the attackers. There is a large protest movement in Luzania of people who want to end the ethicsphere, and a major element of their activities is trying to inflict harm on anybody just to prove the possibility of doing so, but they have not succeeded yet.

The 'quickies' also serve to produce material goods necessary to maintain a high standard of living. Hence, there is not much of an economic life going on, although there are limits for the amount of energy individuals may spend on satisfying their needs. Many Luzanians are involved in intellectual pursuits, such as being professors, students, and government officials, but the problem of nothing productive to do stands prominent. Apparently the 'quickies' are capable of some collective thought, at least for the purposes of self-replication and self-improvement, as well as in order to identify instances of potential harm to individuals (no small feat, no doubt). The artists of Luzania feel particularly slighted by the fact that 'quickies' can create art of all forms of much greater quality than they can; naturally, many of them are members of the protest movement.

There exists ideological opposition between the collectivist Kurdlandia and the generally libertarian Luzania. Generally speaking, many of the people holed up in the kurdls on poor rations would have been more than happy to run away and live in plenty across the border. On the other hand, many Luzanians, especially university students and faculty, dislike the consumerism and ethical limitations of freedom under the 'quickies' and call variously for the imposition of the kurdl-ism or at least for a slight rollback of the technological development and the abolition of the 'quickies', depending on the degree of radicalism of the individual. Luzanians also enjoy traveling to Kurdlandia on vacation to get out of the 'quickies' areas.

The main character spends most of his time in Luzania, studying the history of the world and the current Luzanian social system. We learn about it through his words.

[[File:Ossia-vclo.jpg|thumb|360px|Ossia example (2nd bar).&lt;br /&gt;{{audio|Ossia-vclo.mid|Play original}} {{audio|Ossia-vclo-ossia.mid|Play ossia}}]]
'''''{{Lang|it|Ossia}}''''' {{IPA-it|osˈsiːa|}} is a musical term for an alternative passage which may be played instead of the original passage. The word ''[[Wikt:ossia|ossia]]'' comes from the Italian for "alternatively" and was originally spelled ''o sia'', meaning "or be it" (Fallows 774).

''Ossia'' passages are very common in [[opera]] and solo-[[piano]] works. They are usually an easier version of the preferred form of passage, but in [[Mily Balakirev]]'s ''[[Islamey]]'', for instance, the [[Urtext edition|urtext]] has ossia passages of both types (simpler and more difficult). [[Bel canto]] vocal music also frequently uses ''ossia'', also called ''[[Wikt:oppure|oppure]]'', passages to illustrate a more embellished version of the vocal line (Fallows 774).

On the other hand, an ''ossia'' marking does not always indicate a change in difficulty; the piano solo music of [[Franz Liszt]] is typically full of alternative passages, often no easier or more difficult than the rest of the piece. This reflects Liszt's desire to leave his options open during a performance. Many of his ''ossia'' passages are [[cadenza]]s.

An unusual use of ''ossia'' is found in Alban Berg's [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]] where several ''ossia'' parts are included for the solo violin. If the soloist chooses to play these, the [[concertmaster]] is required to play a different ossia (which takes part of the solo violin line that is lost in favor of the soloist's ossia).

'''Political sociology''' is concerned with the sociological analysis of political phenomena ranging from the State, to civil society, to the family, investigating topics such as citizenship, social movements, and the sources of social power. The lineage of this discipline is typically traced from such thinkers as Montesquieu, Smith and Ferguson through the "founding fathers" of sociology – Marx, Durkheim and Max Weber – to such contemporary theorists as Gellner, Giddens, Habermas and Mann. 
Where a typical research question in political [[sociology]] might have been "Why do so few American or European citizens choose to [[Voting|vote]]?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Why Americans Don't Vote: And Why Politicians Want it That Way | publisher=Pantheon | author=Piven, F. | year=1988 | isbn=0-679-72318-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even "What difference does it make if women get elected?",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Phillips |date=1991|title= Engendering Democracy | location= Cambridge| publisher=Polity | URL=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7EUAQAAIAAJ&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt; political sociologists also now ask: "How is the body a site of power?",&lt;ref&gt;R. Sassatelli (2011) 'Body Politics' in E. Amenta, K. Nash and A. Scott (eds) The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Political Sociology, Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; "How are emotions relevant to global [[poverty]]?",&lt;ref&gt;K. Nash (2008) 'Global citizenship as show business: the cultural politics of Make Poverty History' Media, Culture and Society 30/1 &lt;http://eprints.gold.ac.uk/94/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or "What difference does knowledge make to [[democracy]]?"&lt;ref&gt;B. De Sousa Santos et al.

== Traditional divisions ==
Traditionally there were four main areas of research:

# The sociopolitical formation of the [[modern state]];
# "Who rules?" How [[social inequality]] between [[Social group|groups]] ([[Social class|class]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[gender]], etc.) influences [[politics]];&lt;ref&gt;Domhoff G. William. Power Structure Research and the hope for Democracy. Adam Schneider, April 2005. Web Retrieved 29 Sept. 2009. From: &lt;http://www.polycola.com/search.php?stypes=&amp;eng1=yahoo&amp;eng2=google&amp;st=Web&amp;q=three+major+theoretical+frameworks+are+elite+pluralism+and+managerial+theory.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
# How [[public opinion]], [[ideology|ideologies]], personalities, [[social movement]]s, and trends outside of the formal institutions of political power affect formal politics;
# Power relationships within and between social groups (e.g. families, workplaces, bureaucracy, media, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Buzzell,Timothy, Betty A. Dobratz,and Lisa K. Waldner."The Politics of Social Inequality." 14 Mar. 2001. Web. 29 Sept 2009. From: &lt;http://books.emeraldinsight.com/display.asp?K=9780762307562&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, political sociology was traditionally concerned with how social trends, dynamics, and structures of domination affect formal political processes, as well as exploring how various social forces work together to change political policies.&lt;ref&gt;Nachtigal M. Paul."Political Trends Affecting Nonmetropolitan America." Journal of Research in Rural Education Vol.10 (1994):161–166. Print. From: &lt;http://www.jrre.psu.edu/articles/v10,n3,p161-166,Nachtigal.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, we can identify three major theoretical frameworks: [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]], elite or managerial theory, and class analysis (which overlaps with [[Marxism|Marxist]] analysis).&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, Peter, Arnold Rose, [[Talcott Parsons]], and Neil Smelser. "Political Sociological Theories:Theories of the State and Power." 16 Jan. 2003. Web. 28 Sept 2009 from: &lt;{{cite web |url=http://stmarys.ca/~evanderveen/wvdv/political_sociology/political_sociological_theories.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212105955/http://stmarys.ca/~evanderveen/wvdv/political_sociology/political_sociological_theories.htm |archivedate=2009-12-12 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Pluralism sees politics primarily as a contest among competing interest groups. Elite or managerial theory is sometimes called a state-centered approach. It explains what the state does by looking at constraints from organizational structure, semi-autonomous state managers, and interests that arise from the state as a unique, power-concentrating organization. A leading representative is [[Theda Skocpol]]. Social class theory analysis emphasizes the political power of capitalist elites.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis A. Coser]]. Masters of sociological Thought.Class Theory 1977: 48–50. Web. Retrieved 29 Sept 2009 from &lt;http://www.polycola.com/search.php?stypes=&amp;eng1=yahoo&amp;eng2=google&amp;st=Web&amp;q=social+class+theory+emerged+when&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It can be split into two parts: one is the "power structure" or "instrumentalist" approach, whereas another is the [[Structural functionalism|structuralist]] approach. The power structure approach focuses on the question of who rules and its most well-known representative is [[G. William Domhoff]]. The structuralist approach emphasizes the way a capitalist economy operates; only allowing and encouraging the state to do some things but not others ([[Nicos Poulantzas]], [[Bob Jessop]]).

== Pluralism and power relations ==
Contemporary political sociology takes these questions seriously, but it is concerned with the play of power and politics across societies, which includes, but is not restricted to, relations between the state and society. In part, this is a product of the growing complexity of social relations, the impact of social movement organizing, and the relative weakening of the state as a result of globalization. To a significant part, however, it is due to the radical rethinking of [[social theory]]. This is as much focused now on micro questions (such as the formation of identity through social interaction, the politics of knowledge, and the effects of the contestation of meaning on structures), as it is on macro questions (such as how to capture and use state power). Chief influences here include cultural studies ([[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]]), post-structuralism ([[Michel Foucault]], [[Judith Butler]]), pragmatism ([[Luc Boltanski]]), structuration theory ([[Anthony Giddens]]), and cultural sociology ([[Jeffrey C. Alexander]]).

Political sociology attempts to explore the dynamics between the two institutional systems introduced by the advent of Western capitalist system that are the democratic constitutional liberal state and the capitalist economy. While democracy promises impartiality and legal equality before all citizens, the capitalist system results in unequal [[economic power]] and thus possible political inequality as well.

For pluralists,&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, R. (1989). Democracy and its Critics, New Haven&lt;/ref&gt; the distribution of political power is not determined by economic interests but by multiple social divisions and political agendas. The diverse political interests and beliefs of different factions work together through collective organizations to create a flexible and fair representation that in turn influences political parties which make the decisions. The distribution of power is then achieved through the interplay of contending interest groups. The government in this model functions just as a mediating broker and is free from control by any economic power. This pluralistic democracy however requires the existence of an underlying framework that would offer mechanisms for citizenship and expression and the opportunity to organize representations through social and industrial organizations, such as trade unions. Ultimately, decisions are reached through the complex process of bargaining and compromise between various groups pushing for their interests. Many factors, pluralists believe, have ended the domination of the political sphere by an economic elite. The power of organized labour and the increasingly interventionist state have placed restrictions on the power of capital to manipulate and control the state. Additionally, capital is no longer owned by a dominant class, but by an expanding managerial sector and diversified shareholders, none of whom can exert their will upon another.

The pluralist emphasis on fair representation however overshadows the constraints imposed on the extent of choice offered. Bachrauch and Baratz&lt;ref&gt;Bachrach, P. and M. Baratz (1963). Decision and non-decisions. American Political Science Review, Vol 57&lt;/ref&gt; (1963) examined the deliberate withdrawal of certain policies from the political arena. For example, organized movements that express what might seem as radical change in a society can often by portrayed as illegitimate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9783">'''Rangeland management''' (also '''range management''', '''range science''', or '''arid-land management''') is a professional [[natural science]] that centers around the study of [[rangeland]]s and the "conservation and sustainable management [of Arid-Lands] for the benefit of current societies and future generations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rangelands.org/ Society for range Management. Society for Range Management, 2016. Web. 22 Apr. 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; Range management is defined by Holechek et al. as the "manipulation of rangeland components to obtain optimum combination of [[Ecosystem services|goods and services]] for society on a sustained basis."&lt;ref&gt;Holechek, Jerry L., Rex D. Pieper, and Carlton H. Herbel. Range Management: Principles and Practices (6th Edition). 6th ed. N.p.: Pearson, 2011. 5. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest form of Rangeland Management is not formally deemed part of the natural science studied today, although its roots can be traced to [[Nomad|nomadic grazing]] practices of the [[neolithic agricultural revolution]] when humans [[Domestication|domesticated]] plants and animals under pressures from population growth and environmental change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Ecological History of Agriculture 10,000 B.C.-A.D. 10,000|last=Vasey|first=Daniel A.|publisher=Iowa State University Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=Ames, Iowa|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans might even have altered the environment in times preceding the  [[Neolithic]] through hunting of [[Big-game hunting|large-game]], whereby large losses of [[Grazing|grazing herbivores]] could have resulted in altered ecological states; meaning humans have been inadvertently managing land throughout prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wroe , Judith Field , Richard Fullagar , Lars S. Jermin. "Megafaunal extinction in the late Quaternary and the global overkill hypothesis." ''Alcheringa: An Australasian Journal of Palaeontology.'' Vol. 28, Iss. 1, (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazoyer, Marcel, and Laurence Roudart. ''A History of World Agriculture: From the Neolithic Age to the Current Crisis''. New York: Monthly review Press, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rangeland management was developed in the United States in response to rangeland deterioration and in some cases, [[denudation]], due to [[overgrazing]] and other misuse of arid lands, as was described by [[Garrett Hardin|Hardin]]’s 1968 "[[Tragedy of the Commons]]" and evidenced previously by the 20th century "[[Dust Bowl]]".&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Melvin S. "History of Range Management Education." Rangelands 3.3 (1981): 119-20. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, M W., and F P. Cronemiller. "Some of the Beginnings of Range Management." Journal of Range Management 14.2 (1961): 95-102. Print&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nathan F. Sayre, William deBuys, Brandon T. Bestelmeyer, and Kris M. Havstad. "’The Range  Problem’ After a Century of Rangeland Science: New Research Themes for Altered  Landscapes." Rangeland Ecol Manage 545-552: 65 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the discipline focused on the manipulation of [[grazing]] and the proper use of rangeland vegetation for [[livestock]].&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Kenneth W., W R. Chapline, Lloyd W. Swift, George W. Craddock, and Donald R. Cornelius. "Arthur W. Sampson- Pioneer Range Scientist." Journal of Range Management 20.6 (1967): 245-351. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern application==
Today, range management's focus has been expanded to include the host of [[ecosystem services]] that rangelands provide to humans world-wide. Key management components seek to optimize such goods and services through the protection and enhancement of [[soils]], [[riparian zones]], [[Drainage basin|watersheds]], and vegetation complexes, [[sustainably]] improving outputs of consumable range products such as [[red meat]], [[wildlife]], water, wood, [[fiber]], [[leather]], energy resource extraction, and [[outdoor recreation]], as well as maintaining a focus on the [[Grazing management|manipulation of grazing]] activities of large herbivores to maintain or improve animal and plant production.&lt;ref&gt;J. E. Herrick, J.R. Brown, B.T. Bestelmeyer, S.S. Andrews, G. Baldi, J. Davies, M. Duniway, K.M.  Havstad, J.W. Karl, D.L. Karlen, D.P.C. Peters, J.N. Quinton, C. Riginos, P.L. Shaver, D. Stainaker, S. Twomlow. “Revolutionary Land Use Change in the 21st Century: Is (Rangeland) Science Relevant? Rangeland Ecol Manage 590-598: 65 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society for Range Management [http://www.rangelands.org/] is "the professional society dedicated to supporting persons who work with rangelands and have a commitment to their sustainable use." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rangelands.org/|title=Society for Range Management|website=www.rangelands.org|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary Rangeland Management publications include the ''Journal of Range Management'', ''Rangelands'', and ''Rangeland Ecology &amp; Management''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rangelands.org/publications.shtml|title=Publications|website=www.rangelands.org|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pastoralism]] has become a contemporary anthropological and ecological study as it faces many threats including fragmentation of land, conversion of rangeland into urban development, lack of grazing movement, impending threats on global diversity, damage to species with large terrain, decreases in shared public goods, decreased [[Animal migration|biological movements]], threats of a "tragedy of enclosures", limitation of key resources, reduced biomass and invasive plant species growth.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Robin S.; Fernández-Giménes, María E.; Galvin, Kathleen A. “Dynamics and Resilience of Rangelands and Pastoral Peoples Around the Globe.” ''Annu. Rev. Environ. Resource''. 39:217-249 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in contemporary pastoralist cultures like the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] has continued to increase, especially because the traditional syncreticly-adaptive ability of pastoralists could promise lessons in collaborative and [[adaptive management]] for contemporary pastoralist societies threatened by [[globalization]] as well as for contemporary non-pastoralist societies that are managing livestock on rangelands.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Robin S.; Fernández-Giménes, María E.; Galvin, Kathleen A. “Dynamics and Resilience of Rangelands and Pastoral Peoples Around the Globe.” ''Annu. Rev. Environ. Resource''. 39:217-249 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Briske, D.D.; Sayre, Nathan F.; Huntsoinger; Fernandez-Gimenez, M.; Budd, B.; Derner, J.D. “Origin, Persistence, and Resolution of the Rotational Grazing Debate: Integrating Human Dimensions Into Rangeland research.” ''Rangeland Ecol Manage''. 64(4): 325-334 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and employment==
In the United States, the study of range science is commonly offered at [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] including [[New Mexico State University]], [[Colorado State University]], [[Oregon State University]], [[South Dakota State University]], [[Texas A&amp;M University]], [[Texas Tech University]], the [[University of Arizona]], the [[University of Idaho]], the [[University of Wyoming]], [[Utah State University]], and [[Montana State University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rangelands.org/education_universities.shtml Society for Range Management. Society for Range Management Universities and Colleges, 2016. Web. 22 Apr. 2016. ]&lt;/ref&gt; The Range Science curriculum is strongly tied to [[animal science]], as well as [[plant ecology]], [[soil science]], [[wildlife management]], [[climatology]] and [[anthropology]]. Courses in a typical Range Science curriculum may include [[ethology]], range [[animal nutrition]], [[plant physiology]], [[plant ecology]], [[plant identification]], [[plant communities]], [[microbiology]], [[soil sciences]], [[fire control]], [[agricultural economics]], [[Wildlife management|wildlife ecology]], [[ranch management]], [[Socioeconomics]], [[cartography]], [[hydrology]], [[Ecophysiology]], and [[environmental policy]]. These courses are essential to entering a range science profession.

Students with degrees in range science are eligible for a host of technician-type careers working for the federal government under the [[Bureau of Land Management]], the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]], the [[Agricultural Research Service]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service|NRCS]], or the [[US Forest Service]] as range conservationists, inventory technicians, range monitoring/animal science agents, field botanists, natural-resource technicians, vegetation/habitat monitors, [[Geographic information system|GIS]] programming assistants, general range technicians, and as [[Ecological technology|ecological]] assessors, as well as working in the private sector as range managers, [[Rancher|ranch managers]], producers, commercial consultants, mining and agricultural real estate agents, or as Range/ Ranch Consultants. Individuals who complete degrees at the [[Master's degree|M.S.]] or [[Doctor of Philosophy|P.h.D.]] level, can seek academic careers as [[professor]]s, [[Agricultural extension|extension specialists]], research assistants, and [[Adjunct professor|adjunct]] staff, in addition to a number of professional research positions for government agencies such as the [[US Department of Agriculture]] and other state run departments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rangelands.org/jobs/listings.html#free Society for Range Management.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1490">In [[theoretical computer science]] and [[formal language theory]], a '''ranked alphabet''' is a pair of an [[Alphabet (computer science)|ordinary alphabet]] ''F'' and a function ''Arity'': ''F''→ℕ. Each letter in ''F'' has its [[arity]] so it can be used to build [[Term (logic)|terms]]. Nullary elements (of zero arity) are also called '''constants'''. Terms built with unary symbols and constants can be considered as [[string (computer science)|strings]]. Higher arities lead to proper [[Tree (automata theory)|trees]].

For instance, in the term 
:&lt;math&gt;f(a,g(a),f(a,b,c))&lt;/math&gt;,
''a,b,c'' are constants, ''g'' is unary, and ''f'' is ternary.

Contrariwise,  
:&lt;math&gt;f(a,f(a))&lt;/math&gt;
cannot be a valid term, as the symbol ''f'' appears once as binary, and once as unary, which is illicit, as ''Arity'' must be a function.

{{software development process}}

In [[systems engineering]] and [[software engineering]], '''requirements analysis''' encompasses those tasks that go into determining the needs or conditions to meet for a new or altered product or project, taking account of the possibly conflicting [[requirement]]s of the various [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], ''analyzing, documenting, validating and managing'' software or system requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Kotonya, G. and Sommerville, I. 1998. ''Requirements Engineering: Processes and Techniques'' Chichester, UK: John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

Requirements analysis is critical to the success or failure of a systems or software project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirements should be documented, actionable, measurable, testable, traceable, related to identified business needs or opportunities, and defined to a level of detail sufficient for system design.

== Overview ==
Conceptually, requirements analysis includes three types of activities:{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}
*[[Requirements elicitation|Eliciting requirements]]: (e.g. the project charter or definition), business process documentation, and stakeholder interviews. This is sometimes also called requirements gathering or requirements discovery.
*Analyzing requirements: determining whether the stated requirements are clear, complete, consistent and unambiguous, and resolving any apparent conflicts.
*Recording requirements: Requirements may be documented in various forms, usually including a summary list and may include natural-language documents, [[use case]]s, [[User story|user stories]], process specifications and a variety of models including data models.

Requirements analysis can be a long and tiring process during which many delicate psychological skills are involved. Large systems may confront analysts with hundreds or thousands of system requirements.&lt;ref name="bec1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geoffboeing.com/publications/systems-methods-analyzing-requirements/|author=Beck, A., Boeing, G., &amp; Shannon, D.|title=Systems and Methods for Analyzing Requirements. US Patent 8650186|date=2014|accessdate=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; New systems change the environment and relationships between people, so it is important to identify all the stakeholders, take into account all their needs and ensure they understand the implications of the new systems. Analysts can employ several techniques to elicit the requirements from the customer. These may include the development of scenarios (represented as [[User story|user stories]] in [[Agile software development|agile methods]]), the identification of [[use case]]s, the use of workplace observation or [[ethnography]],  holding [[interview]]s, or [[focus group]]s (more aptly named in this context as requirements workshops, or requirements review sessions) and creating requirements lists. [[Prototyping]] may be used to develop an example system that can be demonstrated to stakeholders.  Where necessary, the analyst will employ a combination of these methods to establish the exact requirements of the stakeholders, so that a system that meets the business needs is produced.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}  Requirements quality can be improved through these and other methods
* Visualization. Using tools that promote better understanding of the desired end-product such as visualization and simulation.
* Consistent use of templates. Producing a consistent set of models and templates to document the requirements.
* Documenting dependencies. Documenting dependencies and interrelationships among requirements, as well as any assumptions and congregations.

== Requirements analysis topics ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2009}}

=== Stakeholder identification ===
See [[Stakeholder analysis]] for a discussion of people or organizations (legal entities such as companies, standards bodies) that have a valid interest in the system. They may be affected by it either directly or indirectly.
A major new emphasis in the 1990s was a focus on the identification of ''stakeholders''. It is increasingly recognized that stakeholders are not limited to the organization employing the analyst. Other stakeholders will include:
* anyone who operates the system (normal and maintenance operators)
* anyone who benefits from the system (functional, political, financial and social beneficiaries)
* anyone involved in purchasing or procuring the system. In a mass-market product organization, product management, marketing and sometimes sales act as surrogate consumers (mass-market customers) to guide development of the product.
* organizations which regulate aspects of the system (financial, safety, and other regulators)
* people or organizations opposed to the system (negative stakeholders; see also [[Misuse case]])
* organizations responsible for systems which interface with the system under design.
* those organizations who [[horizontal integration|integrate horizontally]] with the organization for whom the analyst is designing the system.

=== Joint Requirements Development (JRD) Sessions ===
Requirements often have cross-functional implications that are unknown to individual stakeholders and often missed or incompletely defined during stakeholder interviews. These cross-functional implications can be elicited by conducting JRD sessions in a controlled environment, facilitated by a trained [[facilitator]] (Business Analyst), wherein stakeholders participate in discussions to elicit requirements, analyze their details and uncover cross-functional implications. A dedicated scribe should be present to document the discussion, freeing up the Business Analyst to lead the discussion in a direction that generates appropriate requirements which meet the session objective.

JRD Sessions are analogous to [[Joint application design|Joint Application Design]] Sessions. In the former, the sessions elicit requirements that guide design, whereas the latter elicit the specific design features to be implemented in satisfaction of elicited requirements.

=== Contract-style requirement lists ===
One traditional way of documenting requirements has been contract style requirement lists. In a complex system such requirements lists can run to hundreds of pages long.

An appropriate metaphor would be an extremely long shopping list. Such lists are very much out of favour in modern analysis; as they have proved spectacularly unsuccessful at achieving their aims; but they are still seen to this day.

====Strengths====

* Provides a checklist of requirements.
* Provide a contract between the project sponsor(s) and developers.
* For a large system can provide a high level description from which lower-level requirements can be derived.

====Weaknesses====

* Such lists can run to hundreds of pages. They are not intended to serve as a reader-friendly description of the desired application.
* Such requirements lists abstract all the requirements and so there is little context.  The Business Analyst may include context for requirements in accompanying design documentation.
** '''This abstraction is not intended to describe how the requirements fit or work together.
** The list may not reflect relationships and dependencies between requirements. While a list does make it easy to prioritize each individual item, removing one item out of context can render an entire use case or business requirement useless.
** The list '''doesn't supplant '''the need to review requirements carefully with stakeholders in order to gain a better shared understanding of the implications for the design of the desired system / application.
* Simply creating a list does not guarantee its completeness. The Business Analyst must make a good faith effort to discover and collect a substantially comprehensive list, and rely on stakeholders to point out missing requirements.
* These lists can create a false sense of mutual understanding between the stakeholders and developers; Business Analysts are critical to the translation process.
* It is almost impossible to uncover all the functional requirements before the process of development and testing begins. If these lists are treated '''as an immutable contract, then requirements that emerge in the Development process may generate a controversial change request.'''

====Alternative to requirement lists====

As an alternative to requirement lists, [[Agile software development|Agile Software Development]] uses [[User stories]] to suggest requirements in everyday language.

=== Measurable goals ===
{{main|Goal modeling}}
Best practices take the composed list of requirements merely as clues and repeatedly ask "why?" until the actual business purposes are discovered. Stakeholders and developers can then devise tests to measure what level of each goal has been achieved thus far.  Such goals change more slowly than the long list of specific but unmeasured requirements. Once a small set of critical, measured goals has been established, [[Software prototyping#Throwaway prototyping|rapid prototyping]] and short iterative development phases may proceed to deliver actual stakeholder value long before the project is half over.

===Prototypes===

{{main|Software prototyping}}

A prototype is a computer program that exhibits a part of the properties of another computer program, allowing users to visualize an application that has not yet been constructed. A popular form of prototype is a [[mockup]], which helps future users and other stakeholders to get an idea of what the system will look like. Prototypes make it easier to make design decisions, because aspects of the application can be seen and shared before the application is built. Major improvements in communication between users and developers were often seen with the introduction of prototypes. Early views of applications led to fewer changes later and hence reduced overall costs considerably. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Prototypes can be flat diagrams (often referred to as [[Wire-frame model|wireframes]]) or working applications using synthesized functionality. Wireframes are made in a variety of graphic design documents, and often remove all color from the design (i.e. use a greyscale color palette) in instances where the final software is expected to have [[graphic design]] applied to it. This helps to prevent confusion as to whether the prototype represents the final visual look and feel of the application. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Use cases===
{{main|Use case}}
A use case is a structure for documenting the functional requirements for a system, usually involving software, whether that is new or being changed.  Each use case provides a set of ''scenarios'' that convey how the system should interact with a human user or another system, to achieve a specific business goal.  Use cases typically avoid technical jargon, preferring instead the language of the [[end-user]] or ''[[domain expert]]''.  Use cases are often co-authored by requirements engineers and stakeholders.

Use cases are deceptively simple tools for describing the behavior of software or systems. A use case contains a textual description of the ways in which users are intended to work with the software or system. Use cases should not describe internal workings of the system, nor should they explain how that system will be implemented. Instead, they show the steps needed to perform a task without sequential assumptions.

== Types of requirements ==
{{cleanup|section|date=February 2011}}
[[Requirement]]s are [[Categorization|categorized]] in several ways. The following are common categorizations of requirements that relate to technical management:&lt;ref name="SEF01"/&gt;

;Customer requirements
: Statements of fact and assumptions that define the expectations of the system in terms of mission objectives, environment, constraints, and measures of effectiveness and suitability (MOE/MOS). The customers are those that perform the eight primary functions of systems engineering, with special emphasis on the operator as the key customer. Operational requirements will define the basic need and, at a minimum, answer the questions posed in the following listing:&lt;ref name="SEF01"/&gt;
:*''Operational distribution or deployment'': Where will the system be used?
:*''Mission profile or scenario'': How will the system accomplish its mission objective?
:*''Performance and related parameters'': What are the critical system parameters to accomplish the mission?
:*''Utilization environments'': How are the various system components to be used?
:*''Effectiveness requirements'': How effective or efficient must the system be in performing its mission?
:*''Operational life cycle'': How long will the system be in use by the user?
:*''Environment'': What environments will the system be expected to operate in an effective manner?
;Architectural requirements: Architectural requirements explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary [[systems architecture]] of a [[system]].
;Structural requirements: Structural requirements explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary [[structure]] of a system.
;Behavioral requirements: Behavioral requirements explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary [[behavior]] of a system.
;Functional requirements: [[Functional requirement]]s explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary task, action or activity that must be accomplished. Functional requirements analysis will be used as the toplevel functions for functional analysis.&lt;ref name="SEF01"/&gt;
;Non-functional requirements: [[Non-functional requirement]]s are requirements that specify criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors.
;Performance requirements: The extent to which a mission or function must be executed; generally measured in terms of quantity, quality, coverage, timeliness or readiness. During requirements analysis, performance (how well does it have to be done) requirements will be interactively developed across all identified functions based on system life cycle factors; and characterized in terms of the degree of certainty in their estimate, the degree of criticality to system success, and their relationship to other requirements.&lt;ref name="SEF01"/&gt;
;Design requirements: The "build to", "code to", and "buy to" requirements for products and "how to execute" requirements for processes expressed in technical data packages and technical manuals.&lt;ref name="SEF01"/&gt;
;Derived requirements: Requirements that are implied or transformed from higher-level requirement. For example, a requirement for long range or high speed may result in a design requirement for low weight.&lt;ref name="SEF01"/&gt;
;Allocated requirements: A requirement that is established by dividing or otherwise allocating a high-level requirement into multiple lower-level requirements. Example: A 100-pound item that consists of two subsystems might result in weight requirements of 70 pounds and 30 pounds for the two lower-level items.&lt;ref name="SEF01"/&gt;

Well-known requirements categorization models include [[FURPS]] and FURPS+, developed at [[Hewlett-Packard]].

==Requirements analysis issues==

===Stakeholder issues===
Steve McConnell, in his book ''Rapid Development'', details a number of ways users can inhibit requirements gathering:
* Users do not understand what they want or users don't have a clear idea of their requirements
* Users will not commit to a set of written requirements
* Users insist on new requirements after the cost and schedule have been fixed
* Communication with users is slow
* Users often do not participate in reviews or are incapable of doing so
* Users are technically unsophisticated
* Users do not understand the development process
* Users do not know about present technology
This may lead to the situation where user requirements keep changing even when system or product development has been started.

===Engineer/developer issues===
Possible problems caused by engineers and developers during requirements analysis are:
* A natural inclination towards writing code can lead to implementation beginning before the requirements analysis is complete, potentially resulting in inelegant refactoring to meet actual requirements once they are known.
* Technical personnel and end-users may have different vocabularies. Consequently, they may wrongly believe they are in perfect agreement until the finished product is supplied.
* Engineers and developers may try to make the requirements fit an existing system or model, rather than develop a system specific to the needs of the client.

===Attempted solutions===
One attempted solution to communications problems has been to employ specialists in business or system analysis.

Techniques introduced in the 1990s like [[Software prototyping|prototyping]], [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), [[use case]]s, and [[agile software development]] are also intended as solutions to problems encountered with previous methods.

Also, a new class of [[Application Simulation Software|application simulation]] or application definition tools have entered the market. These tools are designed to bridge the communication gap between business users and the IT organization — and also to allow applications to be 'test marketed' before any code is produced. The best of these tools offer:
* [[electronic whiteboard]]s to sketch application flows and test alternatives
* ability to capture business logic and data needs
* ability to generate high fidelity prototypes that closely imitate the final application
* interactivity
* capability to add contextual requirements and other comments
* ability for remote and distributed users to run and interact with the simulation

[[Image:RS-68 rocket engine test.jpg|thumb|right|[[RS-68]] being tested at NASA's Stennis Space Center. The nearly transparent exhaust is due to this engine's exhaust being mostly [[superheated steam]] (water vapour from its propellants, hydrogen and oxygen)]]

[[Image:Viking 5C rocketengine.jpg|thumb|right|[[Viking (rocket engine)|Viking 5C rocket engine]] ]]

A '''rocket engine''' uses stored [[rocket propellant]] mass for forming its high-speed propulsive [[Jet (fluid)|jet]]. Rocket engines are [[reaction engine]]s, obtaining thrust in accordance with [[Newton's third law]]. Most rocket engines use combustion, although non-combusting forms (such as [[cold gas thruster]]s) also exist. Vehicles propelled by rocket engines are commonly called [[rocket]]s. Since they need no external material to form their jet, rocket engines can perform in a [[vacuum]] and thus can be used to propel [[spacecraft]] and [[ballistic missile]]s.

Compared to other types of jet engines, rocket engines are by far the lightest, and have the highest thrust, but are the least propellant-efficient (they have the lowest [[specific impulse]]). The ideal exhaust is [[hydrogen]], the lightest of all gases, but chemical rockets produce a mix of heavier species, reducing the exhaust velocity. Rocket engines become more efficient at high velocities, due to greater [[propulsive efficiency]] and the [[Oberth effect]]. Since they do not require an atmosphere, they are well suited for uses at very high altitudes and in space.

==Terminology==
Here, "rocket" is used as an abbreviation for "rocket engine".

'''[[Thermal rocket]]s''' use an inert propellant, heated by a power source such as [[Electrothermal propulsion|electric]] or [[nuclear thermal rocket|nuclear power]].

'''Chemical rockets''' are powered by [[exothermic]] chemical reactions of the propellant:

*'''[[Solid-fuel rocket]]s''' (or '''solid-propellant rockets''' or '''motors''') are chemical rockets which use propellant in a solid state.
*'''[[Liquid-propellant rocket]]s''' use one or more liquid propellants fed from tanks.
*'''[[Hybrid rocket]]s''' use a solid propellant in the combustion chamber, to which a second liquid or gas [[oxidizing agent|oxidiser]] or propellant is added to permit combustion.
*'''[[Monopropellant rocket]]s''' use a single propellant decomposed by a [[catalyst]]. The most common monopropellants are [[hydrazine]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]].

==Principle of operation==
[[File:Liquid-Fuel Rocket Diagram.svg|thumb|300px|A simplified diagram of a liquid-fuel rocket.&lt;br&gt;
1. [[Liquid rocket propellant|Liquid rocket fuel]].&lt;br&gt;
2. [[Oxidizing agent|Oxidizer]].&lt;br&gt;
3. Pumps carry the fuel and oxidizer.&lt;br&gt;
4. The [[combustion chamber]] mixes and burns the two liquids.&lt;br&gt;
5. The hot exhaust is choked at the throat, which, among other things, dictates the amount of thrust produced.&lt;br&gt;
6. Exhaust exits the rocket.]]

[[File:Solid-Fuel Rocket Diagram.svg|thumb|300px|A simplified diagram of a solid-fuel rocket.&lt;br&gt;
1. A solid [[Rocket_propellant#Solid_propellants|fuel-oxidizer mixture]] (propellant) is packed into the rocket, with a cylindrical hole in the middle.&lt;br&gt;
2. An [[Pyrotechnic initiator|igniter]] combusts the surface of the propellant.&lt;br&gt;
3. The cylindrical hole in the propellant acts as a [[combustion chamber]].&lt;br&gt;
4. The hot exhaust is choked at the throat, which, among other things, dictates the amount of thrust produced.&lt;br&gt;
5. Exhaust exits the rocket.]]
Rocket engines produce thrust by the expulsion of an exhaust [[fluid]] which has been accelerated to a high speed through a [[propelling nozzle]]. The fluid is usually a gas created by high pressure ({{convert|10|to|200|bar|psi|order=flip|adj=on}}) combustion of solid or liquid [[Rocket propellant|propellants]], consisting of [[fuel]] and [[oxidizing agent|oxidiser]] components, within a [[combustion chamber]]. The nozzle uses the heat energy released by expansion of the gas to accelerate the exhaust to very high ([[supersonic]]) speed, and the reaction to this pushes the engine in the opposite direction. Combustion is most frequently used for practical rockets, as high temperatures and pressures are desirable for the best performance, permitting a longer nozzle, giving higher exhaust speeds and better thermodynamic efficiency.

An alternative to combustion is the [[water rocket]], which uses water pressurised by compressed air, [[carbon dioxide]], [[nitrogen]], or manual pumping, for [[model rocket]]ry.

===Propellant===
Rocket propellant is mass that is stored, usually in some form of propellant tank, or within the combustion chamber itself, prior to being ejected from a rocket engine in the form of a fluid jet to produce thrust.

Chemical rocket propellants are most commonly used, which undergo exothermic chemical reactions which produce hot gas which is used by a rocket for propulsive purposes. Alternatively, a chemically inert [[reaction mass]] can be heated using a high-energy power source via a heat exchanger, and then no combustion chamber is used.

[[Solid rocket]] propellants are prepared as a mixture of fuel and oxidising components called 'grain' and the propellant storage casing effectively becomes the combustion chamber.

===Injection===
[[Liquid rocket|Liquid-fuelled rockets]] force separate fuel and oxidiser components into the combustion chamber, where they mix and burn. [[Hybrid rocket]] engines use a combination of solid and liquid or gaseous propellants. Both liquid and hybrid rockets use ''[[Liquid-fuel rocket#Injectors|injectors]]'' to introduce the propellant into the chamber. These are often an array of simple [[jet (nozzle)|jet]]s - holes through which the propellant escapes under pressure; but sometimes may be more complex spray nozzles. When two or more propellants are injected, the jets usually deliberately cause the propellants to collide as this breaks up the flow into smaller droplets that burn more easily.

===Combustion chamber===
{{main article|Combustion chamber}}
For chemical rockets the combustion chamber is typically just a cylinder, and [[flame holder]]s are rarely used.{{cn|date=August 2018}} The dimensions of the cylinder are such that the propellant is able to combust thoroughly; different [[rocket propellant]]s require different combustion chamber sizes for this to occur.

This leads to a number called &lt;math&gt;L^*&lt;/math&gt;:{{cn|date=August 2018}}
:&lt;math&gt;L^* = \frac {V_c} {A_t}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
*&lt;math&gt;V_c&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the chamber
*&lt;math&gt;A_t&lt;/math&gt; is the area of the throat
L* is typically in the range of {{convert|25|-|60|in|m}}.

The combination of temperatures and pressures typically reached in a combustion chamber is usually extreme by any standard. Unlike in [[airbreathing jet engine]]s, no atmospheric nitrogen is present to dilute and cool the combustion, and the propellant mixture can reach true [[stoichiometric]] ratios. This, in combination with the high pressures, means that the rate of heat conduction through the walls is very high.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

In order for fuel and oxidizer to flow into the chamber, the pressure of the propellant fluids entering the combustion chamber must exceed the pressure inside the combustion chamber itself.  This may be accomplished by a variety of design approaches including [[turbopump]]s or, in simpler engines, via [[Pressure-fed cycle (rocket)|sufficient tank pressure]] to advance fluid flow. Tank pressure may be maintained by several means, including a high-pressure [[helium]] pressurization system common to many large rocket engines or, in some newer rocket systems, by a bleed-off of high-pressure gas from the engine cycle to [[autogenous pressurization|autogenously pressurize]] the propellant tanks&lt;ref name=nsf20160927&gt;
{{cite news |last=Bergin|first=Chris |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/09/spacex-reveals-mars-game-changer-colonization-plan/ |title=SpaceX reveals ITS Mars game changer via colonization plan |work=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]] |date=2016-09-27 |accessdate=2016-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sfi20160927/&gt;  For example, the self-pressurization gas system of the &lt;!-- on both the initial ITS launch vehicle design (2016) and the later BFR design in 2017, for the Raptor methalox engine --&gt;[[BFR (rocket)|BFR]] is a critical part of SpaceX strategy to reduce launch vehicle fluids from five in their legacy Falcon 9 vehicle family to just two in BFR, eliminating not only the helium tank pressurant but all [[hypergolic propellant]]s as well as [[nitrogen]] for cold-gas [[reaction control system|reaction-control thrusters]].&lt;ref name=nsf20161003/&gt;

{{Main article|Rocket engine nozzle}}
[[File:Rocket thrust.svg|thumb|right|Rocket thrust is caused by pressures acting in the combustion chamber and nozzle. From Newton's third law, equal and opposite pressures act on the exhaust, and this accelerates it to high speeds.]]
The hot gas produced in the combustion chamber is permitted to escape through an opening (the "throat"), and then through a diverging expansion section. When sufficient pressure is provided to the nozzle (about 2.5-3 times ambient pressure), the nozzle ''[[choked flow|choke]]s'' and a supersonic jet is formed, dramatically accelerating the gas, converting most of the thermal energy into kinetic energy. Exhaust speeds vary, depending on the expansion ratio the nozzle is designed for, but exhaust speeds as high as ten times the [[speed of sound]] in air at sea level are not uncommon. About half of the rocket engine's thrust comes from the unbalanced pressures inside the combustion chamber, and the rest comes from the pressures acting against the inside of the nozzle (see diagram). As the gas expands ([[Adiabatic process|adiabatically]]) the pressure against the nozzle's walls forces the rocket engine in one direction while accelerating the gas in the other.

[[File:Rocket nozzle expansion.svg|thumb|right|upright|The four expansion regimes of a de Laval nozzle:&lt;br&gt;
• under-expanded&lt;br&gt;
• perfectly expanded&lt;br&gt;
• over-expanded&lt;br&gt;
• grossly over-expanded]]
The most commonly used nozzle is the [[de Laval nozzle]], a fixed geometry nozzle with a high expansion-ratio. The large bell- or cone-shaped nozzle extension beyond the throat gives the rocket engine its characteristic shape.

The exit [[static pressure#Static pressure in fluid dynamics|static pressure]] of the exhaust jet depends on the chamber pressure and the ratio of exit to throat area of the nozzle. As exit pressure varies from the ambient (atmospheric) pressure, a choked nozzle is said to be
* '''under-expanded''' (exit pressure greater than ambient),
* '''perfectly expanded''' (exit pressure equals ambient),
* '''over-expanded''' (exit pressure less than ambient; [[shock diamond]]s form outside the nozzle), or
* '''grossly over-expanded''' (a [[shock wave]] forms inside the nozzle extension).

In practice, perfect expansion is only achievable with a variable-exit area nozzle (since ambient pressure decreases as altitude increases), and is not possible above a certain altitude as ambient pressure approaches zero. If the nozzle is not perfectly expanded, then loss of efficiency occurs. Grossly over-expanded nozzles lose less efficiency, but can cause mechanical problems with the nozzle. Fixed-area nozzles become progressively more under-expanded as they gain altitude. Almost all de Laval nozzles will be momentarily grossly over-expanded during startup in an atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Dexter K Huzel and David H. Huang (1971), [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19710019929_1971019929.pdf NASA SP-125, Design of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines] &amp;nbsp;Second edition of a technical report obtained from the website of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).&lt;/ref&gt;

Nozzle efficiency is affected by operation in the atmosphere because atmospheric pressure changes with altitude; but due to the supersonic speeds of the gas exiting from a rocket engine, the pressure of the jet may be either below or above ambient, and equilibrium between the two is not reached at all altitudes (see diagram).

====Back pressure and optimal expansion====
For optimal performance the pressure of the gas at the end of the nozzle should just equal the ambient pressure: if the exhaust's pressure is lower than the ambient pressure, then the vehicle will be slowed by the difference in pressure between the top of the engine and the exit; on the other hand, if the exhaust's pressure is higher, then exhaust pressure that could have been converted into thrust is not converted, and energy is wasted.

To maintain this ideal of equality between the exhaust's exit pressure and the ambient pressure, the diameter of the nozzle would need to increase with altitude, giving the pressure a longer nozzle to act on (and reducing the exit pressure and temperature). This increase is difficult to arrange in a lightweight fashion, although is routinely done with other forms of jet engines. In rocketry a lightweight compromise nozzle is generally used and some reduction in atmospheric performance occurs when used at other than the 'design altitude' or when throttled. To improve on this, various exotic nozzle designs such as the [[plug nozzle]], [[stepped nozzles]], the [[expanding nozzle]] and the [[aerospike engine|aerospike]] have been proposed, each providing some way to adapt to changing ambient air pressure and each allowing the gas to expand further against the nozzle, giving extra thrust at higher altitudes.

When exhausting into a sufficiently low ambient pressure (vacuum) several issues arise. One is the sheer weight of the nozzle—beyond a certain point, for a particular vehicle, the extra weight of the nozzle outweighs any performance gained. Secondly, as the exhaust gases adiabatically expand within the nozzle they cool, and eventually some of the chemicals can freeze, producing 'snow' within the jet. This causes instabilities in the jet and must be avoided.

On a [[de Laval nozzle]], exhaust gas flow detachment will occur in a grossly over-expanded nozzle.  As the detachment point will not be uniform around the axis of the engine, a side force may be imparted to the engine. This side force may change over time and result in control problems with the launch vehicle.

Advanced [[altitude compensating nozzle|altitude-compensating]] designs, such as the [[aerospike engine|aerospike]] or [[plug nozzle]], attempt to minimize performance losses by adjusting to varying expansion ratio caused by changing altitude.

===Propellant efficiency===
{{see also|Specific impulse}}
[[Image:Nozzle de Laval diagram.svg|thumb|right|upright|Typical temperature (T), pressure (p), and velocity (v) profiles in a de Laval Nozzle]]
For a rocket engine to be propellant efficient, it is important that the maximum pressures possible be created on the walls of the chamber and nozzle by a specific amount of propellant; as this is the source of the thrust. This can be achieved by all of:

*heating the propellant to as high a temperature as possible (using a high energy fuel, containing hydrogen and carbon and sometimes metals such as [[aluminium]], or even using nuclear energy)
*using a low specific density gas (as hydrogen rich as possible)
*using propellants which are, or decompose to, simple molecules with few degrees of freedom to maximise translational velocity

Since all of these things minimise the mass of the propellant used, and since pressure is proportional to the mass of propellant present to be accelerated as it pushes on the engine, and since from [[Newton's third law]] the pressure that acts on the engine also reciprocally acts on the propellant, it turns out that for any given engine, the speed that the propellant leaves the chamber is unaffected by the chamber pressure (although the thrust is proportional). However, speed is significantly affected by all three of the above factors and the exhaust speed is an excellent measure of the engine propellant efficiency. This is termed ''exhaust velocity'', and after allowance is made for factors that can reduce it, the '''[[effective exhaust velocity]]''' is one of the most important parameters of a rocket engine (although weight, cost, ease of manufacture etc. are usually also very important).

For aerodynamic reasons the flow goes sonic ("[[Choked flow|chokes]]") at the narrowest part of the nozzle, the 'throat'. Since the [[speed of sound]] in gases increases with the square root of temperature, the use of hot exhaust gas greatly improves performance. By comparison, at room temperature the speed of sound in air is about 340&amp;nbsp;m/s while the speed of sound in the hot gas of a rocket engine can be over 1700&amp;nbsp;m/s; much of this performance is due to the higher temperature, but additionally rocket propellants are chosen to be of low molecular mass, and this also gives a higher velocity compared to air.

Expansion in the rocket nozzle then further multiplies the speed, typically between 1.5 and 2 times, giving a highly [[collimated]] hypersonic exhaust jet. The speed increase of a rocket nozzle is mostly determined by its area expansion ratio—the ratio of the area of the throat to the area at the exit, but detailed properties of the gas are also important. Larger ratio nozzles are more massive but are able to extract more heat from the combustion gases, increasing the exhaust velocity.

===Thrust vectoring===
{{main article|Thrust vectoring}}
Vehicles typically require the overall thrust to change direction over the length of the burn. A number of different ways to achieve this have been flown:

*The entire engine is mounted on a [[hinge]] or [[gimbal]] and any propellant feeds reach the engine via low pressure flexible pipes or rotary couplings.
*Just the combustion chamber and nozzle is gimballed, the pumps are fixed, and high pressure feeds attach to the engine.
*Multiple engines (often canted at slight angles) are deployed but throttled to give the overall vector that is required, giving only a very small penalty.
*High-temperature vanes protrude into the exhaust and can be tilted to deflect the jet.

==Overall performance==
Rocket technology can combine very high thrust ([[meganewton]]s), very high exhaust speeds (around 10 times the speed of sound in air at sea level) and very high thrust/weight ratios (&gt;100) ''simultaneously'' as well as being able to operate outside the atmosphere, and while permitting the use of low pressure and hence lightweight tanks and structure.

Rockets can be further optimised to even more extreme performance along one or more of these axes at the expense of the others.

===Specific impulse===
{{Specific impulse|align=right}}
{{Main article|Specific impulse}}

The most important metric for the efficiency of a rocket engine is [[impulse (physics)|impulse]] per unit of [[propellant]], this is called [[specific impulse]] (usually written &lt;math&gt;I_{sp}&lt;/math&gt;). This is either measured as a speed (the ''effective exhaust velocity'' &lt;math&gt;v_{e}&lt;/math&gt; in metres/second or ft/s) or as a time (seconds). An engine that gives a large specific impulse is normally highly desirable.

The specific impulse that can be achieved is primarily a function of the propellant mix (and ultimately would limit the specific impulse), but practical limits on chamber pressures and the nozzle expansion ratios reduce the performance that can be achieved.

===Net thrust===
{{main article|Thrust}}
Below is an approximate equation for calculating the net thrust of a rocket engine:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George P. Sutton|author2=Oscar Biblarz|last-author-amp=yes|title=Rocket Propulsion Elements|edition=7th|publisher=Wiley Interscience|date=2001|ISBN=0-471-32642-9}} See Equation 2-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F_n = \dot{m}\;v_{e} = \dot{m}\;v_{e-opt} + A_{e}(p_{e} - p_{amb})&lt;/math&gt;

|}

Since, unlike a jet engine, a conventional rocket motor lacks an air intake, there is no 'ram drag' to deduct from the gross thrust. Consequently, the net thrust of a rocket motor is equal to the gross thrust (apart from static back pressure).

The &lt;math&gt;\dot{m}\;v_{e-opt}\,&lt;/math&gt; term represents the momentum thrust, which remains constant at a given throttle setting, whereas the &lt;math&gt;A_{e}(p_{e} - p_{amb})\,&lt;/math&gt; term represents the pressure thrust term. At full throttle, the net thrust of a rocket motor improves slightly with increasing altitude, because as atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude, the pressure thrust term increases. At the surface of the Earth the pressure thrust may be reduced by up to 30%,depending on the engine design. This reduction drops roughly exponentially to zero with increasing altitude.

Maximum efficiency for a rocket engine is achieved by maximising the momentum contribution of the equation without incurring penalties from over expanding the exhaust. This occurs when &lt;math&gt;p_{e} = p_{amb}&lt;/math&gt;. Since ambient pressure changes with altitude, most rocket engines spend very little time operating at peak efficiency.

===Vacuum specific impulse, I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;===

Due to the specific impulse varying with pressure, a quantity that is easy to compare and calculate with is useful. Because rockets [[choked flow|choke]] at the throat, and because the supersonic exhaust prevents external pressure influences travelling upstream, it turns out that the pressure at the exit is ideally exactly proportional to the propellant flow &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}&lt;/math&gt;, provided the mixture ratios and combustion efficiencies are maintained. It is thus quite usual to rearrange the above equation slightly:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George P. Sutton|author2=Oscar Biblarz|last-author-amp=yes|title=Rocket Propulsion Elements|edition=7th|publisher=Wiley Interscience|date=2001|ISBN=0-471-32642-9}} See Equation 3-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; F_{vac} = C_f\, \dot{m}\, c^*&lt;/math&gt;

and so define the ''vacuum Isp'' to be:

:&lt;math&gt;v_{evac} = C_f\, c^* \,&lt;/math&gt;

where:

: &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;c^*&lt;/math&gt; &amp;thinsp;= &amp;thinsp;the speed of sound constant at the throat
:&lt;math&gt;C_f&lt;/math&gt; &amp;thinsp;= &amp;thinsp;the thrust coefficient constant of the nozzle (typically about 2)

And hence:
:&lt;math&gt; F_n = \dot{m}\, v_{evac} - A_{e}\, p_{amb}&lt;/math&gt;

===Throttling===

Rockets can be throttled by controlling the propellant combustion rate &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}&lt;/math&gt; (usually measured in kg/s or lb/s). In liquid and hybrid rockets, the propellant flow entering the chamber is controlled using valves, in [[solid rocket]]s it is controlled by changing the area of propellant that is burning and this can be designed into the propellant grain (and hence cannot be controlled in real-time).

Rockets can usually be throttled down to an exit pressure of about one-third of ambient pressure&lt;ref name=Sutton/&gt; (often limited by flow separation in nozzles) and up to a maximum limit determined only by the mechanical strength of the engine.

In practice, the degree to which rockets can be throttled varies greatly, but most rockets can be throttled by a factor of 2 without great difficulty;&lt;ref name=Sutton/&gt; the typical limitation is combustion stability, as for example, injectors need a minimum pressure to avoid triggering damaging oscillations (chugging or combustion instabilities); but injectors can be optimised and tested for wider ranges.
For example, some more recent liquid-propellant engine designs that have been optimised for greater throttling capability ([[BE-3]], [[Raptor (rocket engine)|Raptor]]) can be throttled to as low as 18–20 percent of rated thrust.&lt;!-- eg, Blue Orgin BE-3 --&gt;&lt;ref name=sn20150407&gt;

Solid rockets can be throttled by using shaped grains that will vary their surface area over the course of the burn.&lt;ref name=Sutton/&gt;

===Energy efficiency===
{{further information|Rocket#Energy efficiency}}
[[File:Rocket propulsion efficiency.svg|thumb|Rocket vehicle mechanical efficiency as a function of vehicle instantaneous speed divided by effective exhaust speed. These percentages need to be multiplied by internal engine efficiency to get overall efficiency.]]
Rocket engine nozzles are surprisingly efficient [[heat engines]] for generating a high speed jet, as a consequence of the high combustion temperature and high [[compression ratio]]. Rocket nozzles give an excellent approximation to [[adiabatic expansion]] which is a reversible process, and hence they give efficiencies which are very close to that of the [[Carnot cycle]]. Given the temperatures reached, over 60% efficiency can be achieved with chemical rockets.

For a ''vehicle'' employing a rocket engine the energetic efficiency is very good if the vehicle speed approaches or somewhat exceeds the exhaust velocity (relative to launch); but at low speeds the energy efficiency goes to 0% at zero speed (as with all [[jet propulsion]].) &lt;!--- it's very counterintuitive, a way to look at it is that energy= force x distance, but at zero speed you have no movement and you lose lots of energy in the jet ---&gt;See [[Rocket#Energy efficiency|Rocket energy efficiency]] for more details.

{{clear}}

===Thrust-to-weight ratio===
{{Main article|thrust-to-weight ratio}}
Rockets, of all the jet engines, indeed of essentially all engines, have the highest thrust to weight ratio. This is especially true for liquid rocket engines.

This high performance is due to the small volume of [[pressure vessel]]s that make up the engine—the pumps, pipes and combustion chambers involved. The lack of inlet duct and the use of dense liquid propellant allows the pressurisation system to be small and lightweight, whereas duct engines have to deal with air which has a density about one thousand times lower.

{{Engine thrust to weight table}}

Of the liquid propellants used, density is worst for [[liquid hydrogen]]. Although this propellant is marvellous in many ways, it has a very low density, about one fourteenth that of water. This makes the turbopumps and pipework larger and heavier, and this is reflected in the thrust-to-weight ratio of engines that use it (for example the SSME) compared to those that do not (NK-33).

==Cooling==
For efficiency reasons, and because they physically can, rockets run with combustion temperatures that can reach ~3,500 K (~3,200&amp;nbsp;°C or ~5,800&amp;nbsp;°F).

Most other jet engines have gas turbines in the hot exhaust. Due to their larger surface area, they are harder to cool and hence there is a need to run the combustion processes at much lower temperatures, losing efficiency. In addition, [[wiktionary:duct engine|duct engines]] use air as an oxidant, which contains 78% largely unreactive nitrogen, which dilutes the reaction and lowers the temperatures.&lt;ref name=Sutton/&gt; Rockets have none of these inherent disadvantages.

Therefore, temperatures used in rockets are very often far higher than the melting point of the nozzle and combustion chamber materials (~1,200 K for copper). Two exceptions are [[graphite]] and [[tungsten]], although both are subject to oxidation if not protected. Indeed, many construction materials can make perfectly acceptable propellants in their own right. It is important that these materials be prevented from combusting, melting or vaporising to the point of failure. This is sometimes somewhat facetiously termed an "engine-rich exhaust". Materials technology could potentially place an upper limit on the exhaust temperature of chemical rockets.

Alternatively, rockets may use more common construction materials such as aluminium, steel, nickel or copper alloys and employ cooling systems that prevent the construction material itself becoming too hot. [[Regenerative cooling (rocket)|Regenerative cooling]], where the propellant is passed through tubes around the combustion chamber or nozzle, and other techniques, such as curtain cooling or film cooling, are employed to give longer nozzle and chamber life. These techniques ensure that a gaseous thermal [[boundary layer]] touching the material is kept below the temperature which would cause the material to catastrophically fail.

In rockets, the heat fluxes that can pass through the wall are among the highest in engineering; fluxes are generally in the range of 1-200 MW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The strongest heat fluxes are found at the throat, which often sees twice that found in the associated chamber and nozzle. This is due to the combination of high speeds (which gives a very thin boundary layer), and although lower than the chamber, the high temperatures seen there. (See [[#Rocket nozzles|rocket nozzles]] above for temperatures in nozzle).

In rockets the coolant methods include:

#uncooled (used for short runs mainly during testing)
#[[ablation|ablative]] walls (walls are lined with a material that is continuously vaporised and carried away).
#[[radiative cooling]] (the chamber becomes almost white hot and radiates the heat away)
#dump cooling (a propellant, usually [[hydrogen]], is passed around the chamber and dumped)
#[[regenerative cooling (rocket)|regenerative cooling]] ([[liquid rocket]]s use the fuel, or occasionally the oxidiser, to cool the chamber via a cooling jacket before being injected)
#curtain cooling (propellant injection is arranged so the temperature of the gases is cooler at the walls)
#film cooling (surfaces are wetted with liquid propellant, which cools as it evaporates)

In all cases the cooling effect that prevents the wall from being destroyed is caused by a thin layer of insulating fluid (a [[boundary layer]]) that is in contact with the walls that is far cooler than the combustion temperature. Provided this boundary layer is intact the wall will not be damaged.

Disruption of the boundary layer may occur during cooling failures or combustion instabilities, and wall failure typically occurs soon after.

With regenerative cooling a second boundary layer is found in the coolant channels around the chamber. This boundary layer thickness needs to be as small as possible, since the boundary layer acts as an insulator between the wall and the coolant. This may be achieved by making the coolant [[velocity]] in the channels as high as possible.

In practice, regenerative cooling is nearly always used in conjunction with curtain cooling and/or film cooling.

Liquid-fuelled engines are often run [[Air-fuel ratio|fuel-rich]], which lowers combustion temperatures.  This reduces heat loads on the engine and allows lower cost materials and a simplified cooling system. This can also ''increase'' performance by lowering the average molecular weight of the exhaust and increasing the efficiency with which combustion heat is converted to kinetic exhaust energy.

==Mechanical issues==
Rocket combustion chambers are normally operated at fairly high pressure, typically 10–200{{nbsp}}bar (1–20{{nbsp}}MPa, 150–3,000{{nbsp}}psi). When operated within significant atmospheric pressure, higher combustion chamber pressures give better performance by permitting a larger and more efficient nozzle to be fitted without it being grossly overexpanded.

However, these high pressures cause the outermost part of the chamber to be under very large [[hoop stress]]es – rocket engines are [[pressure vessel]]s.

Worse, due to the high temperatures created in rocket engines the materials used tend to have a significantly lowered working tensile strength.

In addition, significant temperature gradients are set up in the walls of the chamber and nozzle, these cause differential expansion of the inner liner that create [[internal stresses]].

==Acoustic issues==
The extreme vibration and acoustic environment inside a rocket motor commonly result in peak stresses well above mean values, especially in the presence of [[organ pipe]]-like resonances and gas turbulence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/414364/whats-the-deal-with-rocket-vibrations/|title=What's the Deal with Rocket Vibrations?|last=Sauser|first=Brittany|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combustion instabilities===
The combustion may display undesired instabilities, of sudden or periodic nature. The pressure in the injection chamber may increase until the propellant flow through the injector plate decreases; a moment later the pressure drops and the flow increases, injecting more propellant in the combustion chamber which burns a moment later, and again increases the chamber pressure, repeating the cycle. This may lead to high-amplitude pressure oscillations, often in ultrasonic range, which may damage the motor. Oscillations of ±200&amp;nbsp;psi at 25&amp;nbsp;kHz were the cause of failures of early versions of the [[LGM-25C Titan II|Titan II]] missile second stage engines. The other failure mode is a [[deflagration to detonation transition]]; the supersonic [[pressure wave]] formed in the combustion chamber may destroy the engine.&lt;ref name="titan2"&gt;{{cite book|author=David K. Stumpf|title=Titian II: A History of a Cold War Missile Program|edition=|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|date=2000|ISBN=1-55728-601-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combustion instability was also a problem during [[SM-65 Atlas|Atlas]] development. The Rocketdyne engines used in the Atlas family were found to suffer from this effect in several static firing tests, and three missile launches exploded on the pad due to rough combustion in the booster engines. In most cases, it occurred while attempting to start the engines with a "dry start" method whereby the igniter mechanism would be activated prior to propellant injection. During the process of man-rating Atlas for [[Project Mercury]], solving combustion instability was a high priority, and the final two Mercury flights sported an upgraded propulsion system with baffled injectors and a hypergolic igniter.

The problem affecting Atlas vehicles was mainly the so-called "racetrack" phenomenon, where burning propellant would swirl around in a circle at faster and faster speeds, eventually producing vibration strong enough to rupture the engine, leading to complete destruction of the rocket. It was eventually solved by adding several baffles around the injector face to break up swirling propellant.

More significantly, combustion instability was a problem with the Saturn F-1 engines. Some of the early units tested exploded during static firing, which led to the addition of injector baffles.

In the Soviet space program, combustion instability also proved a problem on some rocket engines, including the RD-107 engine used in the R-7 family and the RD-216 used in the R-14 family, and several failures of these vehicles occurred before the problem was solved. Soviet engineering and manufacturing processes never satisfactorily resolved combustion instability in larger RP-1/LOX engines, so the RD-171 engine used to power the Zenit family still used four smaller thrust chambers fed by a common engine mechanism.

The combustion instabilities can be provoked by remains of cleaning solvents in the engine (e.g. the first attempted launch of a Titan II in 1962), reflected shock wave, initial instability after ignition, explosion near the nozzle that reflects into the combustion chamber, and many more factors. In stable engine designs the oscillations are quickly suppressed; in unstable designs they persist for prolonged periods. Oscillation suppressors are commonly used.

Periodic variations of thrust, caused by combustion instability or longitudinal vibrations of structures between the tanks and the engines which modulate the propellant flow, are known as "[[pogo oscillation]]s" or "pogo", named after the [[pogo stick]].

Three different types of combustion instabilities occur:

====Chugging====
This is a low frequency oscillation at a few Hertz in chamber pressure usually caused by pressure variations in feed lines due to variations in acceleration of the vehicle.&lt;ref name=sutton1975/&gt;{{rp|261}} 
This can cause cyclic variation in thrust, and the effects can vary from merely annoying to actually damaging the payload or vehicle. Chugging can be minimised by using gas-filled damping tubes on feed lines of high density propellants.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

====Buzzing====
This can be caused due to insufficient pressure drop across the injectors.&lt;ref name=sutton1975/&gt;{{rp|261}} 
It generally is mostly annoying, rather than being damaging. However, in extreme cases combustion can end up being forced backwards through the injectors – this can cause explosions with monopropellants.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

====Screeching====
This is the most immediately damaging, and the hardest to control. It is due to acoustics within the combustion chamber that often couples to the chemical combustion processes that are the primary drivers of the energy release, and can lead to unstable resonant "screeching" that commonly leads to catastrophic failure due to thinning of the insulating thermal boundary layer. Acoustic oscillations can be excited by thermal processes, such as the flow of hot air through a pipe or combustion in a chamber. Specifically, standing acoustic waves inside a chamber can be intensified if combustion occurs more intensely in regions where the pressure of the acoustic wave is maximal.&lt;ref name=strutt1896&gt;

Strutt|title=The Theory of Sound &amp;ndash; Volume 2|edition=2nd|publisher=McMillan (reprinted by Dover Publications in 1945)|date=1896|page=226|ISBN=}} According to Lord Rayleigh’s criterion for thermoacoustic processes, "If heat be given to the air at the moment of greatest condensation, or be taken from it at the moment of greatest rarefaction, the vibration is encouraged.

Such effects are very difficult to predict analytically during the design process, and have usually been addressed by expensive, time consuming and extensive testing, combined with trial and error remedial correction measures.

Screeching is often dealt with by detailed changes to injectors, or changes in the propellant chemistry, or vaporising the propellant before injection, or use of [[Helmholtz damper]]s within the combustion chambers to change the resonant modes of the chamber.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Testing for the possibility of screeching is sometimes done by exploding small explosive charges outside the combustion chamber with a tube set tangentially to the combustion chamber near the injectors to determine the engine's [[impulse response]] and then evaluating the time response of the chamber pressure- a fast recovery indicates a stable system.

===Exhaust noise===
{{main article|acoustic signature}}
For all but the very smallest sizes, rocket exhaust compared to other engines is generally very noisy. As the [[hypersonic]] exhaust mixes with the ambient air, [[shock wave]]s are formed. The [[Space Shuttle]] generates over 200 [[dB(A)]] of noise around its base. To reduce this, and the risk of payload damage or injury to the crew atop the stack, the [[Mobile Launcher Platform]] was fitted with a [[Sound Suppression System]] that sprayed 1,100,000&amp;nbsp;litres of water around the base of the rocket in 41 seconds at launch time. Using this system kept sound levels within the payload bay to 142&amp;nbsp;dB &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  |title=Sound Suppression System
  |publisher=NASA
  |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/sound-suppression-system.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[sound intensity]] from the shock waves generated depends on the size of the rocket and on the exhaust velocity. Such shock waves seem to account for the characteristic crackling and popping sounds produced by large rocket engines when heard live. These noise peaks typically overload microphones and audio electronics, and so are generally weakened or entirely absent in recorded or broadcast audio reproductions. For large rockets at close range, the acoustic effects could actually kill.&lt;ref name="CR566"&gt;R.C. Potter and M.J. Crocker (1966). [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660030602_1966030602.pdf NASA CR-566, Acoustic Prediction Methods For Rocket Engines, Including The Effects Of Clustered Engines And Deflected Flow] From website of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration &amp;ndash; Langley (NASA &amp;ndash; Langley)&lt;/ref&gt;

More worryingly for space agencies, such sound levels can also damage the launch structure, or worse, be reflected back at the comparatively delicate rocket above. This is why so much water is typically used at launches. The water spray changes the acoustic qualities of the air and reduces or deflects the sound energy away from the rocket.

Generally speaking, noise is most intense when a rocket is close to the ground, since the noise from the engines radiates up away from the jet, as well as reflecting off the ground. Also, when the vehicle is moving slowly, little of the chemical energy input to the engine can go into increasing the kinetic energy of the rocket (since useful power ''P'' transmitted to the vehicle is &lt;math&gt;P = F*V&lt;/math&gt; for thrust ''F'' and speed ''V''). Then the largest portion of the energy is dissipated in the exhaust's interaction with the ambient air, producing noise. This noise can be reduced somewhat by flame trenches with roofs, by water injection around the jet and by deflecting the jet at an angle.

==Testing==

Rocket engines are usually statically tested at a [[rocket engine test facility|test facility]] before being put into production. For high altitude engines, either a shorter nozzle must be used, or the rocket must be tested in a large vacuum chamber.

==Safety==
[[Rocket]] vehicles have a reputation for unreliability and danger; especially catastrophic failures. Contrary to this reputation, carefully designed rockets can be made arbitrarily reliable.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} In military use, rockets are not unreliable. However, one of the main non-military uses of rockets is for orbital launch. In this application, the premium has typically been placed on minimum weight, and it is difficult to achieve high reliability and low weight simultaneously. In addition, if the number of flights launched is low, there is a very high chance of a design, operations or manufacturing error causing destruction of the vehicle.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Essentially all launch vehicles are test vehicles by normal aerospace standards ({{As of|2016|lc=on}}).{{Original research inline|date=January 2017}}

===Saturn family (1961–1975)===
The [[Rocketdyne H-1]] engine, used in a cluster of eight in the first stage of the [[Saturn I]] and [[Saturn IB]] [[launch vehicle]]s, had no catastrophic failures in 152 engine-flights. The [[Pratt and Whitney]] [[RL10]] engine, used in a cluster of six in the Saturn I second stage, had no catastrophic failures in 36 engine-flights. The [[Rocketdyne F-1]] engine, used in a cluster of five in the first stage of the [[Saturn V]], had no failures in 65 engine-flights. The [[Rocketdyne J-2]] engine, used in a cluster of five in the Saturn V second stage, and singly in the Saturn IB second stage and Saturn V third stage, had no catastrophic failures in 86 engine-flights.&lt;ref&gt;The J-2 had three premature in-flight shutdowns, and one failure to restart in orbit. But these failures did not result in vehicle loss or mission abort.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==

[[Rocket propellant]]s require a high [[specific energy]] (energy per unit mass), because ideally all the reaction energy appears as kinetic energy of the exhaust gases, and exhaust velocity is the single most important performance parameter of an engine, on which vehicle performance depends.

Aside from inevitable losses and imperfections in the engine, incomplete combustion, etc., after specific reaction energy, the main theoretical limit reducing the exhaust velocity obtained is that, according to the laws of thermodynamics, a fraction of the chemical energy may go into rotation of the exhaust molecules, where it is unavailable for producing thrust. Monatomic gases like helium have only three degrees of freedom, corresponding to the three dimensions of space, {''x,y,z''}, and only such spherically symmetric molecules escape this kind of loss. A diatomic molecule like H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can rotate about either of the two axes perpendicular to the one joining the two atoms, and as the [[equipartition]] law of statistical mechanics demands that the available thermal energy be divided equally among the degrees of freedom, for such a gas in thermal equilibrium 3/5 of the energy can go into unidirectional motion, and 2/5 into rotation (actually, the vibration of the molecule should not be neglected, see [[Heat capacity#Diatomic gas|gas heat capacity]]). A triatomic molecule like water has six degrees of freedom, so the energy is divided equally among rotational and translational degrees of freedom. For most chemical reactions the latter situation is the case. This issue is traditionally described in terms of the ratio, gamma, of the specific heat of the gas at constant volume to that at constant pressure. The rotational energy loss is largely recovered in practice if the expansion nozzle is large enough to allow the gases to expand and cool sufficiently, the function of the nozzle being to convert the random thermal motions of the molecules in the combustion chamber into the unidirectional translation that produces thrust. As long as the exhaust gas remains in equilibrium as it expands, the initial rotational energy will be largely returned to translation in the nozzle.

Although the specific reaction energy per unit mass of reactants is key, low mean molecular weight in the reaction products is also important in practice in determining exhaust velocity. This is because the high gas temperatures in rocket engines pose serious problems for the engineering of survivable motors. Because temperature is proportional to the mean ''energy per molecule'', a given amount of energy distributed among more molecules of lower mass permits a higher exhaust velocity at a given temperature. This means low atomic mass elements are favoured. Liquid [[hydrogen]] (LH2) and [[oxygen]] (LOX, or LO2), are the most effective propellants in terms of exhaust velocity that have been widely used to date, though a few exotic combinations involving boron or liquid ozone are potentially somewhat better in theory if various practical problems could be solved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yarchive.net/space/rocket/fuels/fuel_ratio.html Newsgroup correspondence], 1998-99&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note in computing the specific reaction energy, that the ''entire mass of the propellants, including both fuel and oxidiser'', must be included. The fact that air-breathing engines are typically able to obtain oxygen "for free" without having to carry it along, accounts for one factor of why air-breathing engines are very much more propellant-mass efficient, and one reason that rocket engines are far less suitable for most ordinary terrestrial applications. Fuels for car or [[turbojet engine]]s, use atmospheric oxygen and so have a much better effective energy output per unit mass of propellant that must be carried, but are similar per unit mass of fuel.

Computer programs that predict the performance of propellants in rocket engines are available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rocketworkbench.sourceforge.net/equil.phtml Complex chemical equilibrium and rocket performance calculations], Cpropep-Web&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://propulsion-analysis.com/ Tool for Rocket Propulsion Analysis], RPA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/CEAWeb/ NASA Computer program Chemical Equilibrium with Applications], CEA&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ignition==
{{further information|Combustion}}
With liquid and hybrid rockets, immediate ignition of the propellant(s) as they first enter the combustion chamber is essential.

With liquid propellants (but not gaseous), failure to ignite within milliseconds usually causes too much liquid propellant to be inside the chamber, and if/when ignition occurs the amount of hot gas created can exceed the maximum design pressure of the chamber, causing a catastrophic failure of the pressure vessel.
This is sometimes called a ''[[hard start]]'' or a ''rapid unscheduled disassembly'' (RUD).&lt;ref name=aw20121126&gt;
{{cite news |last=Svitak|first=Amy |title=Falcon 9 RUD? |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Blogs.aspx?plckBlogId=Blog:04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385&amp;plckPostId=Blog:04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385Post:c973f72f-55d3-4374-b722-df31a8d333e6 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321053215/http://www.aviationweek.com/Blogs.aspx?plckBlogId=Blog:04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385&amp;plckPostId=Blog:04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385Post:c973f72f-55d3-4374-b722-df31a8d333e6 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-03-21 |accessdate=2014-03-21 |newspaper=Aviation Week |date=2012-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignition can be achieved by a number of different methods; a pyrotechnic charge can be used, a plasma torch can be used,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} or electric spark ignition&lt;ref name=nsf20161003&gt;
{{cite news |last=Belluscio|first=Alejandro G. |title=ITS Propulsion – The evolution of the SpaceX Raptor engine |work=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]] |date=2016-10-03 |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/10/its-propulsion-evolution-raptor-engine/ |accessdate=2016-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; may be employed. Some fuel/oxidiser combinations ignite on contact ([[hypergolic]]), and non-hypergolic fuels can be "chemically ignited" by priming the fuel lines with hypergolic propellants (popular in Russian engines).

Gaseous propellants generally will not cause [[hard start]]s, with rockets the total injector area is less than the throat thus the chamber pressure tends to ambient prior to ignition and high pressures cannot form even if the entire chamber is full of flammable gas at ignition.

Solid propellants are usually ignited with one-shot pyrotechnic devices.&lt;ref name=Sutton/&gt;

Once ignited, rocket chambers are self-sustaining and igniters are not needed.
Indeed, chambers often spontaneously reignite if they are restarted after being shut down for a few seconds. However, when cooled, many rockets cannot be restarted without at least minor maintenance, such as replacement of the pyrotechnic igniter.&lt;ref name=Sutton/&gt;

==Jet physics==
[[File:Armadillo Aerospace Pixel Hover.jpg|thumb|right|Armadillo aerospace's quad vehicle showing visible banding (shock diamonds) in the exhaust jet]]
Rocket jets vary depending on the rocket engine, design altitude, altitude, thrust and other factors.

Carbon rich exhausts from [[kerosene]] fuels are often orange in colour due to the [[black body radiation]] of the unburnt particles, in addition to the blue [[Swan band]]s. [[high test peroxide|Peroxide]] oxidizer-based rockets and hydrogen rocket jets contain largely [[steam]] and are nearly invisible to the naked eye but shine brightly in the [[ultraviolet]] and [[infrared]]. Jets from [[solid rocket]]s can be highly visible as the propellant frequently contains metals such as elemental aluminium which burns with an orange-white flame and adds energy to the combustion process.

Some exhausts, notably [[alcohol]] fuelled rockets, can show visible [[shock diamond]]s. These are due to cyclic variations in the jet pressure relative to ambient creating shock waves that form 'Mach disks'.

The shape of the jet varies by the design altitude: at high altitude all rockets are grossly under-expanded, and a quite small percentage of exhaust gases actually end up expanding forwards.

! Type
! Description

|-
! [[Solid rocket]]
| Ignitable, self-sustaining solid fuel/oxidiser mixture ("grain") with central hole and nozzle
| Simple, often no [[moving parts]], reasonably good mass fraction, reasonable [[Specific Impulse|''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;]]. A thrust schedule can be designed into the grain.
| Throttling, burn termination, and reignition require special designs.  Handling issues from ignitable mixture. Lower performance than liquid rockets. If grain cracks it can block nozzle with disastrous results. Grain cracks burn and widen during burn. Refueling harder than simply filling tanks. 
|-
! [[Hybrid rocket]]
| Separate oxidiser/fuel; typically the oxidiser is liquid and kept in a tank and the fuel is solid.
| Quite simple, solid fuel is essentially inert without oxidiser, safer; cracks do not escalate, throttleable and easy to switch off.
| Some oxidisers are monopropellants, can explode in own right; mechanical failure of solid propellant can block nozzle (very rare with rubberised propellant), central hole widens over burn and negatively affects mixture ratio.
|-
! [[Monopropellant rocket]]
| Propellant (such as hydrazine, hydrogen peroxide or nitrous oxide) flows over a catalyst and exothermically decomposes; hot gases are emitted through nozzle.
| Simple in concept, throttleable, low temperatures in combustion chamber
| Catalysts can be easily contaminated, monopropellants can detonate if contaminated or provoked, [[Specific Impulse|''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;]] is perhaps 1/3 of best liquids
|-
! [[Liquid bipropellant rocket engine|Bipropellant rocket]]
| Two fluid (typically liquid) propellants are introduced through injectors into combustion chamber and burnt
| Up to ~99% efficient combustion with excellent mixture control, throttleable, can be used with turbopumps which permits incredibly lightweight tanks, can be safe with extreme care
| Pumps needed for high performance are expensive to design, huge thermal fluxes across combustion chamber wall can impact reuse, failure modes include major explosions, a lot of plumbing is needed.
|-
! [[Dual mode propulsion rocket]]
| Rocket takes off as a bipropellant rocket, then turns to using just one propellant as a monopropellant
| Simplicity and ease of control
| Lower performance than bipropellants
|-
! [[Tripropellant rocket]] 
| Three different propellants (usually hydrogen, hydrocarbon, and liquid oxygen) are introduced into a combustion chamber in variable mixture ratios, or multiple engines are used with fixed propellant mixture ratios and throttled or shut down
| Reduces take-off weight, since hydrogen is lighter; combines good thrust to weight with high average [[specific impulse|''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;]], improves payload for launching from Earth by a sizeable percentage
| Similar issues to bipropellant, but with more plumbing, more research and development
|-
! [[Air-augmented rocket]]
| Essentially a ramjet where intake air is compressed and burnt with the exhaust from a rocket
| Mach 0 to Mach 4.5+ (can also run exoatmospheric), good efficiency at Mach 2 to 4
| Similar efficiency to rockets at low speed or exoatmospheric, inlet difficulties, a relatively undeveloped and unexplored type, cooling difficulties, very noisy, thrust/weight ratio is similar to ramjets.
|-
! [[Turborocket]]
| A combined cycle turbojet/rocket where an additional oxidiser such as oxygen is added to the airstream to increase maximum altitude
| Very close to existing designs, operates in very high altitude, wide range of altitude and airspeed
| Atmospheric airspeed limited to same range as turbojet engine, carrying oxidiser like [[LOX]] can be dangerous. Much heavier than simple rockets.
|-
! [[Precooled jet engine]] / [[liquid air cycle engine|LACE]] (combined cycle with rocket)
|Intake air is chilled to very low temperatures at inlet before passing through a ramjet or turbojet engine. Can be combined with a rocket engine for orbital insertion.
| Easily tested on ground. High thrust/weight ratios are possible (~14) together with good fuel efficiency over a wide range of airspeeds, mach 0-5.5+; this combination of efficiencies may permit launching to orbit, single stage, or very rapid intercontinental travel.
| Exists only at the lab prototyping stage. Examples include [[RB545]], [[Reaction Engines SABRE|SABRE]], [[ATREX]]

| Energy is imparted to a usually inert fluid serving as reaction mass via [[Joule heating]] of a heating element. May also be used to impart extra energy to a monopropellant.
| Efficient where electrical power is at a lower premium than mass. Higher [[specific impulse|''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;]] than monopropellant alone, about 40% higher.
| Requires a lot of power, hence typically yields low thrust.
|-
! [[Arcjet rocket]] (chemical burning aided by electrical discharge)
| Identical to resistojet except the heating element is replaced with an electrical arc, eliminating the physical requirements of the heating element.
| 1,600 seconds [[specific impulse|''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;]]
| Very low thrust and high power, performance is similar to [[ion drive]].
|-

==== Solar thermal ====

The [[Solar thermal rocket]] would make use of solar power to directly heat [[reaction mass]], and therefore does not require an electrical generator as most other forms of solar-powered propulsion do. A solar thermal rocket only has to carry the means of capturing solar energy, such as [[Concentrating solar power|concentrator]]s and [[mirror]]s. The heated propellant is fed through a conventional rocket nozzle to produce thrust. The engine thrust is directly related to the surface area of the solar collector and to the local intensity of the solar radiation and inversely proportional to the ''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Single-stage-to-orbit|SSTO]] operation is possible with these propellants even for small rockets, so there are no location, trajectory and shock constraints added by the rocket staging process.

Concepts operating in the millimeter-wave region have to contend with weather availability and high altitude beam director sites as well as effective transmitter diameters measuring 30–300 meters to propel a vehicle to LEO.  Concepts operating in X-band or below must have effective transmitter diameters measured in kilometers to achieve a fine enough beam to follow a vehicle to LEO.

==History of rocket engines==
According to the writings of the Roman [[Aulus Gellius]], in c. 400 BC, a [[Greek people|Greek]] [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] named [[Archytas]], propelled a wooden bird along wires using steam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Leofranc Holford-Strevens|title=Aulus Gellius: An Antonine Author and his Achievement&amp;nbsp;|publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=Revised paperback |date=2005 |isbn=0-19-928980-8 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Archytas |volume=2 |page=446}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it would not appear to have been powerful enough to take off under its own thrust.
;
The ''[[aeolipile]]'' described in the first century BC&lt;!--[[Vitruvius]] described it before Hero--&gt; (often known as ''[[Hero's engine]]'') essentially consists of a [[steam rocket]] on a [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]. It was created almost two millennia before the [[Industrial Revolution]] but the principles behind it were not well understood, and its full potential was not realised for a millennium.&lt;!--Not sure what this latter refers to, but it's probably not critical here--&gt;

The availability of [[black powder]] to propel projectiles was a precursor to the development of the first solid rocket. Ninth Century [[Chinese people|Chinese]] [[Taoist]] [[Alchemy|alchemists]] discovered black powder in a search for the [[elixir of life]]; this accidental discovery led to [[fire arrow]]s which were the first rocket engines to leave the ground.

It is stated that "the reactive forces of incendiaries were probably not applied to the propulsion of projectiles prior to the 13th century". A turning point in rocket technology emerged with a short manuscript entitled ''Liber Ignium ad Comburendos Hostes'' (abbreviated as ''The Book of Fires''). The manuscript is composed of recipes for creating incendiary weapons from the mid-eighth to the end of the thirteenth centuries—two of which are rockets.  The first recipe calls for one part of colophonium and sulfur added to six parts of saltpeter (potassium nitrate) dissolved in [[Lauraceae|laurel]] oil, then inserted into hollow wood and lit to "fly away suddenly to whatever place you wish and burn up everything".  The second recipe combines one pound of sulfur, two pounds of charcoal, and six pounds of saltpeter—all finely powdered on a marble slab.  This powder mixture is packed firmly into a long and narrow case.  The introduction of saltpeter into pyrotechnic mixtures connected the shift from hurled [[Greek fire]] into self-propelled rocketry. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Von Braun|last2= Ordway III|first1=Wernher |first2= Frederick I.|title=The Rockets' Red Glare|date=1976|publisher=Anchor Press/ Doubleday|location=Garden City, New York|isbn=9780385078474|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles and books on the subject of rocketry appeared increasingly from the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries.  In the sixteenth century, German military engineer Conrad Haas (1509-1576) wrote a manuscript which introduced the construction to multi-staged rockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Von Braun|last2= Ordway III|first1=Wernher |first2= Frederick I.|title=The Rockets' Red Glare|date=1976|publisher=Anchor Press/ Doubleday|location=Garden City, New York|isbn=9780385078474|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocket engines were also brought in use by [[Tippu Sultan]], the king of Mysore. These rockets could be of various sizes, but usually consisted of a tube of soft hammered iron about {{convert|8|in|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1+1/2|-|3|in|cm|abbr=on}} diameter, closed at one end and strapped to a shaft of bamboo about {{convert|4|ft|cm|abbr=on}} long. The iron tube acted as a combustion chamber and contained well packed black powder propellant. A rocket carrying about one pound of powder could travel almost {{convert|1000|yd|m}}. These 'rockets', fitted with swords used to travel long distance, several meters above in air before coming down with swords edges facing the enemy. These rockets were used against British empire very effectively.

Slow development of this technology continued up to the later 19th century, when Russian [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] first wrote about [[liquid rocket|liquid-fueled rocket engines]]. He was the first to develop the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]], though it was not published widely for some years.

The modern solid- and liquid-fueled engines became realities early in the 20th century, thanks to the American physicist [[Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard]]. Goddard was the first to use a [[De Laval nozzle]] on a solid-propellant (gunpowder) rocket engine, doubling the thrust and increasing the efficiency by a factor of about twenty-five. This was the birth of the modern rocket engine. He calculated from his independently-derived rocket equation that a reasonably sized rocket, using solid fuel, could place a one-pound payload on the Moon. He began to use liquid propellants in 1921 and was the first to launch, in 1926, a liquid-propellant rocket. Goddard pioneered the use of the De Laval nozzle, lightweight propellant tanks, thrust vectoring, the smoothly-throttled liquid fuel engine, regenerative cooling, and curtain cooling.&lt;ref name=Sutton/&gt;{{rp|247–266}}

During the late 1930s, German scientists, such as [[Wernher von Braun]] and [[Hellmuth Walter]], investigated installing liquid-fueled rockets in military aircraft ([[Heinkel He 112]], [[Heinkel He 111|He 111]], [[Heinkel He 176|He 176]] and [[Messerschmitt Me 163]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lutz Warsitz|title=The First Jet Pilot - The Story of German Test Pilot Erich Warsitz|edition=|publisher=Pen and Sword Ltd.|date=2009|ISBN=978-1-84415-818-8}} Includes von Braun’s and Hellmuth Walter’s experiments with rocket aircraft. [http://www.pen-and-sword.co.uk/?product_id=1762 English edition.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The turbopump was first employed by German scientists in WWII. Until then cooling the nozzle had been problematic, and the [[V-2 rocket|A4]] ballistic missile used dilute alcohol for the fuel, which reduced the combustion temperature sufficiently.

[[Staged combustion cycle (rocket)|Staged combustion]] (''Замкнутая схема'') was first proposed by [[Aleksei Mihailovich Isaev|Alexey Isaev]] in 1949. The first staged combustion engine was the S1.5400 used in the Soviet planetary rocket, designed by Melnikov, a former assistant to Isaev.&lt;ref name=Sutton&gt;{{cite book|last=Sutton|first=George P.|title=History of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines|date=2005|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|location=Reston, VA}}&lt;/ref&gt; About the same time (1959), [[Nikolai Dmitriyevich Kuznetsov|Nikolai Kuznetsov]] began work on the closed cycle engine [[NK-9]] for Korolev's orbital ICBM, GR-1. Kuznetsov later evolved that design into the [[NK-15]] and [[NK-33]] engines for the unsuccessful Lunar [[N1 rocket]].

In the West, the first laboratory staged-combustion test engine was built in Germany in 1963, by [[Ludwig Boelkow]].

Hydrogen peroxide / kerosene fueled engines such as the British [[Gamma (Rocket engine)|Gamma]] of the 1950s used a closed-cycle process (arguably not ''staged combustion'', but that's mostly a question of semantics) by catalytically decomposing the peroxide to drive turbines ''before'' combustion with the kerosene in the combustion chamber proper. This gave the efficiency advantages of staged combustion, whilst avoiding the major engineering problems.

Liquid hydrogen engines were first successfully developed in America, the [[RL-10]] engine first flew in 1962. Hydrogen engines were used as part of the [[Apollo program]]; the liquid hydrogen fuel giving a rather lower stage mass and thus reducing the overall size and cost of the vehicle.

Most engines on one rocket flight was 44 set by NASA in 2016 on a [[Black Brant (rocket)|Black Brant]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.space.com/33810-nasa-world-record-most-rocket-engines.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11100">{{Community|Community Social Work=}}

'''Sense of community''' (or '''psychological sense of community''') is a concept in [[community psychology]], [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]], and [[Community practice|community social work]], as well as in several other research disciplines, such as [[urban sociology]], which focuses on the ''experience'' of community rather than its structure, formation, setting, or other features. The latter is the province of [[public administration]] or community services administration which needs to understand how structures influence this feeling and psychological sense of community. [[Sociologist]]s, [[social psychologist]]s, [[anthropologist]]s, and others have theorized about and carried out [[empirical research]] on community, but the [[psychological]] approach asks questions about the individual's [[perception]], [[understanding]], [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[emotion|feelings]], etc. about community and his or her relationship to it and to others' participation—indeed to the complete, multifaceted community experience.

In his seminal 1974 book, psychologist [[Seymour B. Sarason]] proposed that psychological sense of community become the conceptual center for the psychology of [[community]], asserting that it "is one of the major bases for self-definition." By 1986 it was regarded as a central overarching concept for [[community psychology]] (Sarason, 1986; Chavis &amp; Pretty, 1999).In addition, the theoretical concept entered the other applied academic disciplines as part of "communities for all" initiatives in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Magrab, P. (1999). The meaning of community. (pp. 3-30). In: R.N. Roberts &amp; P. R. Magrab, ''Where Children Live: Solutions for Serving Young Children and their Families''. Stamford, Ct: Ablex Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among theories of sense of community proposed by [[psychologist]]s, McMillan &amp; Chavis's (1986) is by far the most influential, and is the starting point for most of the recent research in the field. It is discussed in detail below.

== Definitions ==

For Sarason, psychological sense of community is "the [[perception]] of similarity to others, an acknowledged [[interdependence]] with others, a willingness to maintain this interdependence by giving to or doing for others what one expects from them, and the feeling that one is part of a larger dependable and stable structure" (1974, p.&amp;nbsp;157).

McMillan &amp; Chavis (1986) define sense of community as "a feeling that members have of belonging, a feeling that members matter to one another and to the group, and a shared faith that members' needs will be met through their [[personal commitment|commitment]] to be together."

Gusfield (1975) identified two dimensions of community: territorial and relational. The relational dimension of community has to do with the nature and quality of relationships in that community, and some communities may even have no discernible territorial demarcation, as in the case of a community of scholars working in a particular specialty, who have some kind of contact and quality of relationship, but may live and work in disparate locations, perhaps even throughout the world. Other communities may seem to be defined primarily according to territory, as in the case of [[neighborhood]]s, but even in such cases, proximity or shared territory cannot by itself constitute a community; the relational dimension is also essential.

[[Factor analysis]] of their urban neighborhoods [[questionnaire]] yielded two distinct factors which Riger and Lavrakas (1981) characterized as "social bonding" and "physical rootedness", very similar to the two dimensions proposed by Gusfield.
Early work on psychological sense of community was based on neighborhoods as the referent, and found a relationship between psychological sense of community and '''greater participation''' (Hunter, 1975; Wandersman &amp; Giamartino, 1980), '''perceived safety''' (Doolittle &amp; McDonald, 1978), '''ability to function competently in the community''' (Glynn, 1981), '''social bonding''' (Riger &amp; Lavrakas, 1981), '''social fabric''' (strengths of [[interpersonal relationship]]) (Ahlbrandt &amp; Cunningham, 1979), '''greater sense of purpose and perceived control''' (Bachrach &amp; Zautra, 1985), and '''greater civic contributions''' ([[Donation|charitable contributions]] and civic involvement) (Davidson &amp; Cotter, 1986). These initial studies lacked a clearly articulated [[conceptual framework]], however, and none of the measures developed were based on a [[theoretical definition]] of psychological sense of community.

== Primary theoretical foundation: McMillan and Chavis ==

McMillan &amp; Chavis's (1986) theory (and instrument) are the most broadly validated and widely utilized in this area in the psychological literature. They prefer the abbreviated label "sense of community", and propose that sense of community is composed of four elements.

===Four elements of sense of community===
There are four elements of "sense of community" according to the McMillan &amp; Chavis theory:

====Membership====
Membership includes five attributes:
* boundaries
* emotional safety
* a sense of belonging and identification
* personal investment
* a common symbol system

====Influence====
Influence works both ways: members need to feel that they have some influence in the group, and some influence by the group on its members is needed for group cohesion. Current researches (e.g. Chigbu, 2013) on rural and urban communities have found that sense of community is a major factor.

====Integration and fulfillment of needs====
Members feel rewarded in some way for their participation in the community.

====Shared emotional connection====
The "definitive element for true community" (1986, p.&amp;nbsp;14), it includes shared history and shared participation (or at least identification with the history).

===Dynamics within and between the elements===
McMillan &amp; Chavis (1986) give the following example to illustrate the dynamics within and between these four elements (p.&amp;nbsp;16):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Someone puts an announcement on the dormitory bulletin board about the formation of an intramural dormitory basketball team. People attend the organizational meeting as strangers out of their individual needs (integration and fulfillment of needs). The team is bound by place of residence (membership boundaries are set) and spends time together in practice (the contact hypothesis). They play a game and win (successful shared valent event). While playing, members exert energy on behalf of the team (personal investment in the group). As the team continues to win, team members become recognized and congratulated (gaining honor and status for being members). Someone suggests that they all buy matching shirts and shoes (common symbols) and they do so (influence).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Current research====
In their 2002 study of a [[community of interest]], specifically the science fiction fandom community, Obst, Zinkiewicz, and Smith suggest Conscious Identification as the fifth dimension (Obst, 2002).

== Empirical assessment ==

Chavis et al.'s '''Sense of Community Index''' ('''SCI''') (see Chipuer &amp; Pretty, 1999; Long &amp; Perkins, 2003), originally designed primarily in reference to neighborhoods, can be adapted to study other communities as well, including the [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]], [[school]]s, [[religious communities]], communities of interest, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26216">'''Sex therapy''' is a strategy for the improvement of sexual function and treatment of [[sexual dysfunction]].  This includes sexual dysfunctions such as [[premature ejaculation]] or [[delayed ejaculation]], [[erectile dysfunction]], lack of sexual interest or arousal, and [[painful sex]] ([[vaginismus]] and [[dyspareunia]]).  It includes dealing with problems imposed by atypical sexual interests ([[paraphilia]]s), [[gender dysphoria]] and [[transgender]] issues, very high sex drive or [[hypersexuality]], a lack of sexual confidence, recovering from [[sexual assault]], and sexual issues in aging, illness, or disability.&lt;ref name = BinikHall&gt;Binik, Y. M., &amp; Hall, K. S. K. (2014). ''Principles and practice of sex therapy (5th ed.).''  NY: Guildford,&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice ==
Modern sex therapy often integrates [[psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] techniques and medical ones,&lt;ref name = Bancroft2009&gt;Bancroft, J. (2009). ''Human Sexuality and Its Problems (3rd ed.).''  Edinburgh: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; such as Viagra ([[sildenafil]]) to increase erectile response and Paxil ([[paroxetine]]) to treat premature ejaculation.  Sex therapists assist those experiencing problems in overcoming them, in doing so possibly regaining an active sex life.  The transformative approach to sex therapy aims to understand the [[psychological]], biological, [[pharmacological]], relational, and contextual aspects of sexual problems.&lt;ref name="Sex Therapy Today"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leiblum|first=Sandra|title=Principles and Practice of Sex Therapy, Fourth Edition, Chapter 1: Sex Therapy Today, Current Issues and Future Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IoG26ZJ-gkkC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=sex+therapy+#v=onepage&amp;q=sex%20therapy&amp;f=false|publisher=Guilford Press|accessdate=15 March 2014|isbn=978-1-60623-827-1|date=2006-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex therapy requires rigorous evaluation that includes a medical and psychological examination. The reason is that sexual dysfunction may have a somatic base or a psychogenic basis. A clear example is erectile dysfunction (sometimes still called "impotence"), whose etiology may include, firstly, circulatory problems, and secondly, performance anxiety. Sex therapy is frequently short term, with duration depending on the causes for therapy.&lt;ref name="Mayo Clinic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayo Clinic|title=Sex Therapy Definition|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sex-therapy/basics/definition/prc-20020669|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex therapy can be provided by licensed psychologists or physicians, who have undergone training and become certified.&lt;ref name="Mayo Clinic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayo Clinic|title=Sex Therapy Definition|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sex-therapy/basics/definition/prc-20020669|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors and Therapists (AASECT) oversees clinical training for a sexual health practitioner to become a certified sex therapist (CST).  Any licensed mental health counselor can practice sex therapy.

Sex therapy is distinct from [[sexual surrogate|sex surrogates]].  Whereas sex therapists discuss and instruct clients in sex-based exercises to be performed at home between sessions, sexual surrogates participate in the exercises with their clients as part of helping them to practice and develop improved skills.  Therapists and surrogates sometimes collaborate on cases.  Certified sex therapists do not have sexual contact with their clients.&lt;ref name="Mayo Clinic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayo Clinic|title=Sex Therapy Definition|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sex-therapy/basics/definition/prc-20020669|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symptoms ===
Sex therapy sessions are focused on the individual's symptoms rather than on underlying [[psychodynamic]] conflicts. The sexual dysfunctions which may be addressed by sex therapy include non-consummation, premature ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, low libido, unwanted sexual fetishes, sexual addiction, painful sex, or a lack of sexual confidence, assisting people who are recovering from sexual assault, problems commonly caused by stress, tiredness, and other environmental and relationship factors. Sex therapy can either be on an individual basis or with the sex partner.&lt;ref name="Mayo Clinic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayo Clinic|title=Sex Therapy Definition|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sex-therapy/basics/definition/prc-20020669|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex therapy can be conducted with any adult, including older adults; any [[gender expression]]; and [[LGBTQ]]-identified people.&lt;ref name="Mayo Clinic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayo Clinic|title=Sex Therapy Definition|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sex-therapy/basics/definition/prc-20020669|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A therapist's misunderstanding of these conflicts can lead to resistance or serve as a barrier to improving sexual dysfunctions that are directly or indirectly related to sex.&lt;ref name="The_New_Sex_Therapy"&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-1-4613-3000-4_25|chapter=The New Sex Therapy|title=The Interface Between the Psychodynamic and Behavioral Therapies|pages=363|year=1980|last1=Kaplan|first1=Helen Singer|isbn=978-1-4613-3002-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interest in sex therapy among couples has increased along with the number of sexuality educators, counselors, and therapists.&lt;ref name="The_New_Sex_Therapy" /&gt; Today, sexual problems are no longer regarded as symptoms of hidden deviant, pathological, or psychological defects in maturity or development.&lt;ref name="Sex Therapy Today"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leiblum|first=Sandra|title=Principles and Practice of Sex Therapy, Fourth Edition, Chapter 1: Sex Therapy Today, Current Issues and Future Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IoG26ZJ-gkkC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=sex+therapy+#v=onepage&amp;q=sex%20therapy&amp;f=false|publisher=Guilford Press|accessdate=15 March 2014|isbn=978-1-60623-827-1|date=2006-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex therapy has also influenced the emergence of sexual medicine and exploring integrative approaches to sex therapy, in addition to reducing or eliminating sexual problems and increasing sexual satisfaction for individuals of all stages of life. Health therapists, educators, and counselors are conducting research and administering surveys to fully understand normative sexual function – what most people do and experience as they grow older and live longer.&lt;ref name="Sex Therapy Today"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leiblum|first=Sandra|title=Principles and Practice of Sex Therapy, Fourth Edition, Chapter 1: Sex Therapy Today, Current Issues and Future Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IoG26ZJ-gkkC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=sex+therapy+#v=onepage&amp;q=sex%20therapy&amp;f=false|publisher=Guilford Press|accessdate=15 March 2014|isbn=978-1-60623-827-1|date=2006-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aging and sexuality ==

Both physical and emotional transformation throughout various stages of life can affect the body and sexuality. The subsequent decline in [[hormone]] levels and changes in [[neurological]] and [[circulatory]] functioning may lead to sexual problems such as [[erectile dysfunction]] or vaginal pain.&lt;ref name="Sexuality in Midlife and Beyond"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvard Health Publications|title=Sexuality in Midlife and Beyond|url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/special_health_reports/Sexuality_in_Midlife_and_Beyond|publisher=Harvard Health|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These physical changes often affect the intensity of youthful sex and may give way to more subdued responses during [[Middle age|middle]] and [[Old age|later]] life.&lt;ref name="Sexuality in Midlife and Beyond"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvard Health Publications|title=Sexuality in Midlife and Beyond|url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/special_health_reports/Sexuality_in_Midlife_and_Beyond|publisher=Harvard Health|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues with low [[libido]] and [[sexual dysfunction]] are usually considered to be a byproduct of old age. The emotional byproducts of maturity, however — increased confidence, better communication skills, and lessened inhibitions — can help create a richer, more nuanced, and ultimately satisfying sexual experience.&lt;ref name="Sexuality in Midlife and Beyond"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvard Health Publications|title=Sexuality in Midlife and Beyond|url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/special_health_reports/Sexuality_in_Midlife_and_Beyond|publisher=Harvard Health|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During AARP's last surveys in 1999, 2004, and 2009 statistics well-being among older adults has increased; however, overall sexual satisfaction has decreased.&lt;ref name="Sex, Romance, and Relationships of Older Adults"&gt;{{cite web|last=Garrett|first=Mario|title=Sex, Romance, and Relationships of Older Adults|publisher=''[[Psychology Today]]''|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/iage/201305/sex-romance-and-relationships-older-adults|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, older adults believed that an active sexual life offers great pleasure but contributes materially to overall emotional and physical health.&lt;ref name="Sex, Romance, and Relationships of Older Adults" /&gt;

=== Older adults ===
[[File:Old couple in love.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A woman touches a man's face.|Sex therapy, at any age, often involves sensate-focused touching]]

Over the years, little attention has been paid to older adults and sexuality. As the population of older adults and life expectancy continues to grow, there is information about sex therapy but it is often not easily accepted. Cultural and sexual roles are always changing throughout the lifecourse. As people age, they are often viewed as [[Asexuality|asexual]] or as incapable of possessing sexual desires. The presence of sexual dysfunction during old age can be impacted by health problems. There are many [[endocrine]], [[vascular]] and [[neurological]] disorders that may interfere in sexual function, along with some medications and surgeries.&lt;ref name="Sexual Issues and Aging Within the Context of Work With Older Adult Patients"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hillman|first=Jennifer|title=Sexual Issues and Aging Within the Context of Work With Older Adult Patients|url=http://www.globalaging.org/health/us/2009/elderly%20sexuality.pdf|publisher=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|accessdate=15 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502114805/http://www.globalaging.org/health/us/2009/elderly%20sexuality.pdf|archivedate=2 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older men experience changes that occur in sexual [[physiology]] and affect both erectile function and [[ejaculation]].&lt;ref name="Sexual Issues and Aging Within the Context of Work With Older Adult Patients"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hillman|first=Jennifer|title=Sexual Issues and Aging Within the Context of Work With Older Adult Patients|url=http://www.globalaging.org/health/us/2009/elderly%20sexuality.pdf|publisher=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|accessdate=15 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502114805/http://www.globalaging.org/health/us/2009/elderly%20sexuality.pdf|archivedate=2 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While older women experience [[physiological]] effects of aging after [[menopause]], resulting in the decreased production of [[estrogen]].

[[File:Suzuki violin recital.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A group of Suzuki method students performing on violin.]]
{{Music Education|major}}
The '''Suzuki method''' is an internationally known music curriculum and teaching philosophy dating from the mid-20th century, created by Japanese [[violin]]ist and pedagogue [[Shinichi Suzuki (violinist)|Shinichi Suzuki]] (1898–1998). The method aims to create an [[Nature versus nurture|environment]] for learning music which parallels the linguistic environment of acquiring a native language. Suzuki believed that this environment would also help to foster good [[moral character]].

==Background==
{{quote|I want to make good citizens.  If a child hears fine music from the day of his birth and learns to play it himself, he develops sensitivity, discipline and endurance.  He gets a beautiful heart.|Shinichi Suzuki}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The Suzuki Method was conceived in the mid-20th century by Suzuki, a Japanese [[violin]]ist who desired to bring beauty to the lives of children in his country after the devastation of [[World War II]]. As a skilled violinist but a beginner at the [[German language]] who struggled to learn it, Suzuki noticed that children pick up their native language quickly, and even dialects adults consider "difficult" to learn are spoken with ease by children at age five or six. He reasoned that if children have the skill to acquire their [[first language|native language]], they have the necessary ability to become proficient on a musical instrument.  

He pioneered the idea that preschool age children could learn to play the violin if the learning steps were small enough and the instrument was scaled down to fit their body.  He modeled his method, which he called {{nihongo|"Talent Education"|才能教育|sainō kyōiku}}, after his theories of natural [[language acquisition]]. Suzuki believed that every child, if properly taught, was capable of a high level of musical achievement. He also made it clear that the goal of such musical education was to raise generations of children with "noble hearts" (as opposed to creating famous musical [[child prodigy|prodigies]]).

==Philosophy==
{{quote|''...all'' children can be well educated...|Shin'ichi Suzuki}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The central belief of Suzuki, based on his language acquisition theories, is that all people can (and will) learn from their [[Nature versus nurture|environment]].  The essential components of his method spring from the desire to create the "right environment" for learning music (he believed that this positive environment would also help to foster excellent [[moral character|character]] in every student).  These components include:

*Saturation in the musical [[community]]. 
::This includes attending local classical music [[concert]]s, developing friendships with other music students, and listening to recordings of professional musicians in the home every day, starting before birth if possible.
*Deliberate avoidance of musical aptitude tests or [[audition]]s to begin music study. 
::Suzuki believed that teachers who test for musical aptitude before taking students, or who look only for "talented" students, are limiting themselves to people who have already started their music education. Just as every child is expected to learn their native language, Suzuki expected every child to be able to learn to play music.
*Emphasis on playing from a very young age,
::typically starting formal instruction between the ages of three and five years old.  (See [[Suzuki method#Technique|Technique]]).
*Using well-trained teachers.
::Suzuki believed in training musicians not only to be better musicians but also to be better teachers. Suzuki Associations worldwide offer ongoing teacher-training programs to prospective and continuing Suzuki teachers.  
*In the beginning, [[learning music by ear]] is emphasized over reading written [[musical notation]].  
::Suzuki observed that children speak before learning to read, and thought that children should also be able to play music before learning to read. To support learning by ear, students are expected to listen to recordings of the music they are learning daily. Other methods—such as [[Simply Music]], the Gordon Music Learning Theory, and Conversational Solfège—have students playing before reading notes, but may not have the same focus on daily listening and learning by ear.
*Memorization of all solo repertoire is expected.
::The focus on memorization continues even after a student begins to use [[sheet music]] to learn new pieces. 
*Music theory and note reading are left to the teacher. 
::The Suzuki method does not include a formal plan or prescribe specific materials for introducing music theory &amp; reading, in part because Suzuki created the method in a culture where music literacy was routinely taught in schools.
*Regular playing in groups (including playing pieces in [[unison]]) is strongly encouraged.
*Retaining and reviewing every piece of music ever learned is also strongly encouraged. 
::This is intended to raise technical and musical ability. Review pieces, along with "preview" parts of music a student is yet to learn, are often used in place of the more traditional [[etude]] books.  Traditional etudes and technical studies are not used in the beginning stages, which focus almost exclusively on a set of performance pieces.
*Frequent public performance makes performing feel like a natural and enjoyable part of being a musician.

The method discourages competitive attitudes between players, and advocates collaboration and mutual encouragement for those of every ability and level.  However, this does not mean the elimination of auditions or evaluations of student performances.

The parent of the young student is expected to supervise instrument practice every day, instead of leaving the child to practice alone between lessons, and to attend and take notes at every lesson so they can coach the student effectively. This element of the method is so prominent that a newspaper article once dubbed it "The Mom-Centric Method."&lt;ref name="meyermom"&gt;Meyer, Constance (2003-09-07). The Mom-centric method. LA Times, 7 September 2003. Retrieved from http://articles.latimes.com/2003/sep/07/entertainment/ca-meyer7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
Although Suzuki was a violinist, the method he founded is not a "school of violin playing" (like the French or the Russian schools of playing) whose students can be identified by the set of techniques they use to play the violin.  However, some of the technical concepts Suzuki taught his own students, such as the development of "tonalization", were so essential to his way of teaching that they have been carried over into the entire method.  Other non-instrument specific techniques are used to implement the basic elements of the philosophy in each [[academic discipline|discipline]].

*'''Tonalization''' is a term coined by Suzuki, and is deliberately similar to the word "vocalization" (as it is used by singers when they talk about warming up their voices).  Tonalization is defined as the student's ability to produce and recognize a beautiful, ringing tone quality on their instrument. While initially developed for violin education, the tonalization technique has been applied to other instruments such as the piano. Suzuki believed that a student must learn tonalization in order to properly reproduce and perform music (Lavie, Karen, New Zealand Suzuki Journal, 2005).  Outside the Suzuki method, the term used is "tone production," and is part of Western music education stretching back to its beginning. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}
*Using '''[[sound recording]]s''' is another technique common to all the musical instruments taught in the Suzuki method.  Thibeault's (2018) history of Suzuki's mediated pedagogy presents Suzuki as a technological innovator who created new ways of learning from sound recordings. Pre-recorded music is used to help students learn notes, [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[rhythm]], and beautiful tone quality [[learning music by ear|by ear]]. Suzuki pointed out that great artists (such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]) were surrounded with excellent performances from birth, and that the advent of recording technology made this aspect of their environment possible to achieve for large numbers of "ordinary" people whose parents were not themselves great musicians &amp; music teachers like [[Leopold Mozart|Mozart's father]] was.  So-called "traditional" (that is, not Suzuki trained) music educators have used this technique since the earliest days of recording technology; the difference in the Suzuki method is the scale on which Suzuki systematically insisted on daily listening in the home, from before birth if possible, and his focus on using recordings of beginner's repertoire alongside recordings of advanced repertoire.
*"Adult" sized '''instruments are adapted''' to meet the demands of a small child's body in various ways.  This lowers the age at which people are developmentally ready to begin studying an instrument.  Scaled down instrument sizes are used for children studying [[stringed instruments]]. Curved headjoint flutes with displaced keys which are closer together than normal flute keys &amp; holes are also available making it possible for children as young as 3 years old to study the flute through the Suzuki method.  Height adjustable chairs, benches, and footrests are used for piano, guitar, cello, and string bass.  Although fractional sized student violins were available when Suzuki began to teach, the success and popularity of his idea that pre-school aged children could also learn to play prompted [[luthier|violinmakers]] to scale violins down to even smaller [[violin#Sizes|sizes]] than before.
*'''Suzuki Institutes''' were established to encourage a musical community, train teachers, and provide a place where master teachers' ideas can be spread to the whole community of Suzuki students, teachers and parents.  These short term music festivals began in Matsumoto, Japan, where teachers &amp; students came to learn from Suzuki.  In the US, they often last for a week or two and include daily [[masterclass]]es; repertoire (group) classes; teacher training courses; concerts; discussion sessions; seminars; and various 'enrichment' classes in different musical styles, instruments, or non-musical (usually arts, crafts, or dancing) activities.  As at any music festival, participants must pay registration and tuition fees to the institute they are attending.  Each national Suzuki association handles registration for teacher training, and policies differ from country to country.
*A '''common repertoire''' for all students of an instrument was established.  This body of music allows each student to participate in group classes, helps foster local and international musical community and camaraderie, and provides motivation for students to learn new music while keeping the 'old' pieces they have learned in top form.  This is in direct contrast to music education outside of the method, in which teachers tailor the repertoire to the current need and level of the individual student.

==Repertoire==
{{quote|...If it is true that "everything in music is preparation" (Gerhart Zimmermann), then the genius of Suzuki is truly expressed in the scope and sequencing of the music....|Edward Kreitman}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The core Suzuki literature is published on [[sound recording|audio recordings]] and in [[sheet music]] books for each instrument, and Suzuki teachers supplement the repertoire common to each instrument as needed, particularly in the area of teaching reading.  One of the innovations of the Suzuki method was to make quality recordings of the beginners' pieces widely available, performed by professional musicians. Many traditional (non-Suzuki trained) music teachers also use the Suzuki repertoire, often to supplement their [[curriculum]], and they adapt the music to their own philosophies of teaching.

Another innovation of Suzuki was to deliberately leave out the large amount of technical instructions and exercises found in many beginners' music books of his day.  He favored a focus on melodic [[song]]-playing over technical exercises, and asked teachers to allow students to make music from the beginning, helping to motivate young children with short, attractive songs which can themselves be used as technique building exercises.  Each song in the common repertoire is carefully chosen to introduce some new or higher level of technique than the previous selection.

Suzuki teaching uses a common core repertoire for students of the same instrument worldwide, and although it focuses on Western European "classical" music, it emphasizes that this music can be a bridge across cultural and language barriers: one does not have to share the ethnic or national origin of the composers in order to learn or share the music. Suzuki created a series of rhythmic variations on the theme "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star", using rhythms from more advanced literature in units small enough for a beginner to grasp quickly.  Although these variations were created for violin, most of the instruments use them as a starting point for their repertoire.

===Violin===
The violin method was compiled and edited by [[Shinichi Suzuki (violinist)|Suzuki]].  In ten volumes, beginning with Suzuki's [[Variation (music)|Variations]] on "[[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]]" and ending with two [[Mozart]] concertos.  The first 3 books are mostly graded [[arrangements]] of music not originally written for solo violin, although book 1 contains several original compositions by Suzuki for violin &amp; piano. These arrangements are drawn from folk tunes and from composers such as [[Bach]], [[Telemann]], [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], [[Beethoven]], [[Schubert]], [[Handel]], [[Paganini]], [[Boccherini]] and [[Brahms]]. Books 4–10 continue the graded selection by incorporating 'standard' or 'traditional' student violin solos by [[Fritz Seitz|Seitz]], [[Vivaldi]], [[Bach]], [[Veracini]], [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli]], [[Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf|Dittersdorf]], [[Rameau]], [[Handel]], [[Mozart]], [[Fiocco]], and others. The Suzuki violin repertoire is currently in the process of being revised by the International Suzuki Association, and as part of the revision process, each regional Suzuki Association provides a recommended list of supplemental repertoire appropriate for students in books 6-8. The SAA supplemental repertoire list includes pieces by Bach, [[Fritz Kreisler|Kreisler]], [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]], [[Béla Bartók|Bartok]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], [[Aaron Copland|Copland]], and others (Suggested Supplementary Repertoire, 2013, and Preucil, 1985).

Audio recordings for books 1–4 are available in separate albums by artists such as [[David Nadien]], [[David Cerone]], Yukari Tate and Shin'ichi Suzuki. More recent recordings of volumes 1–4 by William Preucil, Jr. were released in 2007, along with revised versions of the first 4 books.  Recordings for books 5–8 have been made by [[Koji Toyoda]], although many of the pieces can be found separately on other artist's albums. In 2008 [[Takako Nishizaki]] made a complete set of recordings of Books 1-8 for [[Naxos Records]]. There are no official recordings of books 9 and 10 but these books, simply being Mozart's A major and D major violin concertos, have readily available recordings by various violinists. Completing the 10 volumes is not the end of the Suzuki journey, as many Suzuki violin teachers traditionally continue with the [[Max Bruch|Bruch]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] concertos, along with pieces from other composers such as [[Maria Theresa von Paradis|Paradis]],
[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], and [[Fritz Kreisler|Kreisler]].

===Viola===
The viola repertoire is in nine volumes, compiled and edited by [[Doris Preucil]]. Like the violin repertoire, much of the viola repertoire is drawn from the [[Baroque]] period. The first 3 volumes have been arranged (or [[transposition (music)|transposed]]) almost directly from the first 3 violin volumes, and the rest differ significantly as they delve into standard viola literature.  The viola books introduce shifting and work in higher positions earlier than the violin volumes, in anticipation of viola students being asked to play in ensembles sooner in their studies than violinists, and needing these skills to better handle orchestral or chamber music parts (Preucil, 1985). Viola volumes 4-8 include works by [[Telemann]], [[Henri Casadesus|Casadesus]], [[Bach]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Vivaldi]], [[Jean-Marie Leclair|Leclair]], [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel|Hummel]],and [[Max Bruch|Bruch]]. Books 1–4 have been recorded on two albums by [[William Preucil]], and the rest are available in separate albums.

===Cello===
The cello repertoire is in ten volumes, with some early pieces arranged from the early violin volumes, and the first distinct piece (the second) being "French Folk Song".  Tsuyoshi Tsutsumi performs volumes 1 through 4. Volumes 4–10 contain works by: [[Vivaldi]], [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], [[David Popper|Popper]], [[Breval]], [[Goltermann]], [[William Henry Squire|Squire]], [[Bach]], [[Maria Theresa von Paradis|Paradis]], [[Henry Eccles|Eccles]], [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]], [[von Goens]], [[Sammartini]], [[Haydn]], and [[Boccherini]].

===Piano===
The piano repertoire is composed of seven volumes. The first book begins with Variations on "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" (as with the violin books) and continues with many folk songs and contemporary songs. As one progresses to the second book, there are pieces written by [[classical period (music)|romantic, classical]] and [[baroque music|baroque]] composers, such as Robert Schumann, [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. The third book is early intermediate level with several sonatinas and beginning with Sonatina in C Major, Op. 36, No. 1 by Muzio Clementi. The fourth book includes Sonata in G Major, Op. 49, No. 2 by Ludwig van Beethoven and ends with Minuet 1,  Minuet 2 and the Gigue from Partita in B{{Music|b}} by J.S. Bach.  The fifth book begins with the famous "[[Für Elise]]" by Beethoven and includes Sonata in C Major, Hob. XVI/35 by Franz Joseph Haydn.  The sixth book begins with the Sonata in C Major, K.545 by W.A. Mozart, and the seventh book begins with the Piano Sonata No. 11 in A Major by [[Mozart]].  This book also includes "[[The Harmonious Blacksmith]]" by [[Handel]] and Romanian Folk Dances by Béla Bartók. There are also many [[minuet]]s in the second book. The New International Edition adds some more recent compositions to the books, such as the music of Béla Bartók. Revised versions of the piano books have now been published.  The new volumes are collections of piano repertoire from all eras representing works by composers such as Mozart, Burgmüller, Beethoven, Bach, Tcherepnin, Tchaikovsky, Schumann, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Daquin, Grieg, Granados, Villa-Lobos, Scarlatti, Handel, Bartók, and Debussy. Many pieces from the original books remain; some have been shifted to another volume.  The book/CD combo for Revised Books 4-7 is now available, and was performed by Japanese concert artist Seizo Azuma.

===Bass===
Currently there are five printed volumes in the [[double bass]] series, with the first three volumes also available on recordings. Nine volumes are planned and being compiled and edited by Dr. S Daniel Swaim (SAA, Chair), Virginia Dixon (SAA), Michael Fanelli (SAA), Domenick Fiore (SAA), and Eugene Rebeck (SAA). Volume 1 and 2 contain arrangements of the traditional Suzuki violin pieces mixed in with some new arrangements of other pieces. Volume 3 contains some new transcriptions of jazz, Gaelic, and folk songs; plus works by [[Handel]], [[Gossec]], [[Beethoven]], [[Bach]], Webster, [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], and [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]]. Famous pieces include: The Elephant from [[Carnival of the Animals]] by Saint-Saëns, [[Ode to Joy]] by Beethoven, and Largo from the [[New World Symphony]] by Dvořák.

===Flute===
The flute repertoire is compiled and edited by Toshio Takahashi. In fourteen volumes, beginning with [[Mary Had a Little Lamb]] and ending in the Flute Concerto by [[Otaka]]. Also included are concerti by [[Mozart]], [[Cimarosa]], [[Ibert]] and [[Quantz]]. Students also study music by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Handel]], [[Michel Blavet|Blavet]], [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]] and other major composers.

===Recorder===
There are eight volumes of recorder repertoire for both soprano and alto recorder.  The recorder repertoire shares some early repertoire with other instruments, such as "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star", several Bach Minuets, etc.  Later books delve into more complex Renaissance and Baroque music, including instruction in intense Baroque ornamentation along with 17th-century Dutch and Italian articulation techniques.

===Guitar===
The [[classical guitar]] repertoire was compiled through a collaborative process involving teachers from the United States, Europe and Australia, and edited by Frank Longay.  The nine volumes begin with Twinkle Variations and many folk songs, and adds pieces originally written for the [[lute]] in the Renaissance, and spanning all musical time periods, including pieces by [[Gaspar Sanz|Sanz]], [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Matteo Carcassi|Carcassi]], [[Mauro Giuliani|Giuliani]], [[Fernando Sor|Sor]], [[Francisco Tárrega|Tarrega]], [[Isaac Albéniz|Albéniz]], [[Alonso Mudarra|Mudarra]], and Yocoh's [[Sakura Sakura|Sakura]] Variations.  Music in book one is performed by Frank Longay and Bill Kossler, with books two through four recorded by Seth Himmelhoch, Andrew LaFrenier, and Louis Brown.  George Sakellariou has recorded books five, six and seven and [[William Kanengiser]] recorded books 8 and 9, with the exception of [[Recuerdos de la Alhambra]] in book 9, which was recorded by [[Scott Tennant]].

===Harp===
The harp repertoire is in five volumes. These books are suitable for learning to read and play music on the pedal harp or the lever harp (folk harp, Irish/Celtic harp, etc. that preferably has 30 or more strings). Most of the music is arrangements of either folk music or classical music. Students of the lever harp will find some of the pieces in the later books to have challenging lever changes.  This series ultimately leads to more in-depth study of the pedal harp and its repertoire and teaches more of a classical style technique.  Those pursuing traditional Celtic music can use this as a foundation, however, the traditional style of teaching focuses on relying on the ear rather than on the written note.  Repertoire for volume six is selected, though the music is not published in a single book.&lt;ref&gt;http://suzukiharpinfo.com/whats-new-suzuki-harp/book-status/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice===
The voice repertoire is in five Levels.  Developed in Finland since 1986, the vocal repertoire of the Suzuki method has spread to over 20 countries including The United States, Australia, Europe, Asia and New Zealand. Teacher training courses are scheduled yearly in Europe, US and Australia.

===Organ===
The [[pipe organ]] repertoire was compiled and edited by Gunilla Rönnberg and Lars Hagström beginning in 1998.  Currently Volumes 1-4 have been published, Volumes 5 &amp; 6 will be published shortly, and material for Volumes 7 &amp; 8 is being researched. (Suzuki Organ website, 2010). As of 2011, an active Suzuki-training organ scheme is under way in the Australian city of [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]].

===Mandolin===
The application of Suzuki's teaching philosophy to the mandolin is currently being researched in Italy by Amelia Saracco.

===Early childhood education and Suzuki in the schools===
Although [[early childhood education]] (ECE) is not an instrument, a curriculum for (pre-instrumental) ECE has been developed within the Suzuki philosophy by Dorothy Jones (SAA), Jeong Cheol Wong (ASA), Emma O'Keefe (PPSA), Anke van der Bijl (ESA), and Yasuyo Matsui (TERI).  Also, a "modified" Suzuki philosophy curriculum has been developed to apply Suzuki teaching to heterogeneous instrumental music classes &amp; string orchestras in schools.

===Trumpet===
Trumpet was added to the International Suzuki Association's list of Suzuki Method instruments in 2011. The application of Suzuki's teaching philosophy to the trumpet is currently being researched in Sweden; the first Trumpet teacher training course to be offered by the European Suzuki Association in 2013. (Suzuki Teacher Training for Trumpet, 2013).

===Supplemental materials===
Supplementary materials are also published under the Suzuki name, including some etudes, note-reading books, piano accompaniment parts, guitar accompaniment parts, [[duet]]s, [[trio (music)|trio]]s, [[string orchestra]], and [[string quartet]] arrangements of Suzuki repertoire.

==Historical notes==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
In the late 19th century, Japan's borders were [[Meiji period#Economy|opened to trade with the outside world]], and in particular to the importation of [[Western Culture]].  As a result of this, Suzuki's father, who owned a company which had manufactured the [[Shamisen]], began to manufacture [[violin]]s instead. (''Nurture by Love'' Documentary) In his youth, Shin'ichi Suzuki chanced to hear a [[phonograph]] recording of [[Franz Schubert]]'s Ave Maria, as played on violin by [[Mischa Elman]].  Gripped by the beauty of the music, he immediately picked up a violin from his father's factory and began to teach himself to play the instrument "[[learning music by ear|by ear]]".  His father felt that instrumental performance was beneath his son's social status, and refused to allow him to study the instrument.  At age 17, he began to teach himself by ear, since no formal training was allowed to him.  Eventually he convinced his father to allow him to study with a violin teacher in Tokyo. (Suzuki, ''Nurtured by Love'')

At age 22, Suzuki travelled to Germany to find a violin teacher to continue his studies.  While there, he studied privately with [[Karl Klingler]], but did not receive any formal degree past his high school diploma.  He met and became friends with [[Albert Einstein]], who encouraged him in learning classical music.  He also met, courted, and married his wife, Waltraud.(Suzuki, ''Nurtured by Love'')

In 1945, Suzuki began his Talent Education movement in [[Matsumoto, Nagano|Matsumoto]], [[Japan]] shortly after the end of [[World War II]].  Raising children with "noble hearts" (inspired by great music and diligent study) was one of his primary goals; he believed that people raised and "nurtured by love" in his method would grow up to achieve better things than war. One of his students during this post-1945 period was violinist Hidetaro Suzuki, no relation, who later became a veteran of international violin competitions (Tchaikovsky, Queen Elizabeth, Montreal International) and then the longtime concertmaster of the [[Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra]]. (Hermann, 1981)

Eventually, the center of the Suzuki movement in education was established as the Talent Education Research Institute (TERI) in Matsumoto.  TERI hosts thousands of people each year—students, parents, teachers, (and teacher trainees).  Other organizations have sprung up all over the world to help oversee the movement and train teachers.  These include the Asia Suzuki Association, the Suzuki Association of the Americas, the European Suzuki Association (which is currently assisting in the beginnings of the Suzuki movement in [[Africa]]), and the Pan-Pacific Suzuki Association.(International Suzuki Association, 2016).

[[John D. Kendall]] of [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]] brought the Suzuki method, along with adaptations to better fit the requirements of the American classroom, to the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s (''Nurtured by Love'' Documentary). [[Vilem Sokol]] of the [[Seattle Youth Symphony]] hosted Suzuki in Seattle. The majority of American Suzuki pedagogues and teaching methods are grounded in the Suzuki-Kendall system.  Other pioneers of the Suzuki Method in the US include [[Roland and Almita Vamos]], Elizabeth and Harlow Mills, [[Betty Haag]], Louise Behrend, Dorothy Roffman, William Starr, Anastasia Jempelis, and Margery Aber.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The '''Systems Modeling Language''' ('''SysML''')&lt;ref&gt;''Flexible Views for View-based Model-driven Development'' By Burger, Erik. KIT Scientific Publishing, Nov 14, 2014. Pg. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[general-purpose modeling]] language for [[systems engineering]] applications. It supports the specification, [[analysis]], [[design]], [[verification and validation]] of a broad range of systems and [[System of systems|systems-of-systems]].

SysML was originally developed by an [[open source]] specification project, and includes an open source license for distribution and use.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web|author=SysML Forum|title=SysML FAQ|url=http://www.sysmlforum.com/FAQ.htm|accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; SysML is defined as an extension of a subset of the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) using [[profile (UML)|UML's profile mechanism]]. The language's extensions were designed to support systems engineering activities.

== Overview ==
SysML offers systems engineers several noteworthy improvements over UML, which tends to be software-centric. These improvements include the following:&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt;

* SysML's semantics are more flexible and expressive. SysML reduces UML's software-centric restrictions and adds two new diagram types, requirement and parametric diagrams. The former can be used for [[requirements engineering]]; the latter can be used for [[Profiling (computer programming)|performance analysis]] and [[Statistics|quantitative analysis]]. Consequent to these enhancements, SysML is able to model a wide range of systems, which may include hardware, software, information, processes, personnel, and facilities.
* SysML is a comparatively little language that is easier to learn and apply.&lt;ref&gt;Embedded Systems Security. By David Kleidermacher, Mike Kleidermacher. Elsevier, 2012. Pg 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Since SysML removes many of UML's software-centric constructs, the overall language measures smaller both in diagram types and total constructs.
* SysML allocation tables support common kinds of allocations. Whereas UML provides only limited support for tabular notations, SysML furnishes flexible allocation tables that support requirements allocation, functional allocation, and structural allocation. This capability facilitates automated [[verification and validation]] (V&amp;V) and gap analysis.
* SysML model management constructs support models, views, and viewpoints. These constructs extend UML's capabilities and are architecturally aligned with [[IEEE-Std-1471-2000]] (IEEE Recommended Practice for Architectural Description of Software Intensive Systems).

SysML reuses seven of UML 2's fourteen diagrams, and adds two diagrams (requirement and parametric diagrams) for a total of nine diagram types. SysML also supports allocation tables, a tabular format that can be dynamically derived from SysML allocation relationships. A table which compares SysML and UML 2 diagrams is available in the SysML FAQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sysmlforum.com/faq/|title=SysML Forum: SysML FAQ - What is SysML?, Why use SysML?, Who created SysML?|work=sysmlforum.com|accessdate=2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantages of SysML over UML for systems engineering become obvious when considering a concrete example, like modeling an automotive system. With SysML one can use Requirement diagrams to efficiently capture functional, performance, and interface requirements, whereas with UML one is subject to the limitations of [[use case diagram]]s to define high-level functional requirements. Likewise, with SysML one can use Parametric diagrams to precisely define performance and quantitative constraints like maximum [[acceleration]], minimum [[curb weight]], and total [[air conditioning]] capacity. UML provides no straightforward mechanism to capture this sort of essential performance and quantitative information.

Concerning the rest of the automotive system, enhanced [[activity diagram]]s and [[State diagram#UML state diagram|state machine diagrams]] can be used to specify the [[embedded software]] control logic and information flows for the on-board automotive computers. Other SysML structural and behavioral diagrams can be used to model factories that build the automobiles, as well as the interfaces between the organizations that work in the factories.

== History ==
The SysML initiative originated in a January 2001 decision by the [[INCOSE|International Council on Systems Engineering]] (INCOSE) Model Driven Systems Design workgroup to customize the UML for systems engineering applications. Following this decision, INCOSE and the [[Object Management Group]] (OMG), which maintains the UML specification, jointly chartered the OMG Systems Engineering Domain Special Interest Group (SE DSIG) in July 2001. The SE DSIG, with support from INCOSE and the [[ISO 10303|ISO AP 233]] workgroup, developed the requirements for the modeling language, which were subsequently issued by the OMG parting in the ''UML for Systems Engineering Request for Proposal'' (UML for SE RFP; OMG document ad/03-03-41) in March 2003.&lt;ref name="rfp"&gt;{{cite web|author=OMG SE DSIG|title=UML for Systems Engineering RFP|url=http://syseng.omg.org/UML_for_SE_RFP.htm|accessdate=2006-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 [[Cris Kobryn]] and Sanford Friedenthal organized and co-chaired the [[SysML Partners]], an informal association of industry leaders and tool vendors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sysml.org/partners.htm|title=SysML Partners|accessdate=2006-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which initiated an open source specification project to develop the SysML in response to the UML for Systems Engineering RFP.&lt;ref name="sysml faq"&gt;{{cite web|author=SysML Forum|title=SysML FAQ|url=http://www.sysmlforum.com/faq.htm|accessdate=2006-06-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060716231947/http://www.sysmlforum.com/faq.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original technical contributors and co-authors of the SysML 1.0a specification were Laurent Balmelli, Conrad Bock, Rick Steiner, Alan Moore and Roger Burkhart. The SysML Partners distributed their first open source SysML specification drafts in 2004, and submitted SysML 1.0a to the OMG for technology adoption in November 2005.

=== OMG SysML ===
After a series of competing SysML specification proposals, a SysML Merge Team was proposed to the OMG in April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omg.org/docs/ad/06-03-01.pdf OMG document ad/06-03-01] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201130201/http://www.omg.org/docs/ad/06-03-01.pdf |date=2008-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal was voted upon and adopted by the OMG in July 2006 as OMG SysML, to differentiate it from the original open source specification from which it was derived. Because OMG SysML is derived from open source SysML, it also includes an open source license for distribution and use.

The OMG SysML v. 1.0 specification was issued by the OMG as an Available Specification in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omg.org/spec/SysML/1.0/PDF|title=SysML 1.0|work=omg.org|accessdate=2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current version of OMG SysML is v1.5, which was issued by the OMG in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.omg.org/spec/SysML/1.5/|title = SysML|work = omg.org|accessdate = 2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, SysML was published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) in 2017 as a full [[International standard|International Standard]] (IS), ISO/IEC 19514:2017 (Information technology -- Object management group systems modeling language).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/65231.html|title=ISO/IEC 19514:2017 - Information technology -- Object management group systems modeling language (OMG SysML)|website=www.iso.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The OMG has been working on the next generation of SysML and issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for version 2 on December 8, 2017, following its open standardization process.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.omgwiki.org/OMGSysML/doku.php?id=sysml-roadmap:sysml_v2_requirements_review_page|title=sysml-roadmap:sysml_v2_requirements_review_page [OMG SysML Portal]|website=www.omgwiki.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.omg.org/gettingstarted/processintro.htm|title=OMG Process Introduction {{!}} Object Management Group|last=http://themeforest.net/user/dan_fisher|website=www.omg.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting specification, which will incorporate language enhancements from experience applying the language, will include a UML profile, a [[Metamodeling|metamodel]], and a mapping between the profile and metamodel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A second RFP for a SysML v2 [[Application programming interface|Application Programming Interface]] (API) and Services is also being developed. Its aim is to enhance the interoperability of [[model-based systems engineering]] tools. The OMG plans to issue this second RFP in June 2018.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Diagrams ==
SysML includes 9 types of diagram, some of which are taken from [[Unified Modelling Language|UML]].

* [[Block definition diagram]]
* [[Internal block diagram]]
* [[Package diagram]]
* [[Use case diagram]]
* [[Requirement Diagram]]
* [[Activity diagram]]
* [[Sequence diagram]]
* [[State machine diagram]]
* [[Parametric diagram]]

== Tools ==
There are several modeling tool vendors already offering SysML support, or are in the process of updating their tools to comply with the OMG SysML specification. Lists of tool vendors who support, or have announced support of, SysML or OMG SysML can be found on the SysML Forum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.SysMLforum.com|title=SysML Forum: What is SysML? - What You Need to Know|work=sysmlforum.com|accessdate=2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; or SysML&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omgsysml.org|title=OMG SysML|work=omgsysml.org|accessdate=2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; websites, respectively.

=== Model exchange ===
As an [[Object Management Group|OMG]] [[Unified Modeling Language|UML 2.0]] [[profile (UML)|profile]], SysML models are designed to be exchanged using the [[XML Metadata Interchange]] (XMI) standard. In addition, architectural alignment work is underway to support the [[ISO 10303]] (also known as STEP, the Standard for the Exchange of Product model data) AP-233 standard for exchanging and sharing information between [[systems engineering]] software applications and tools.

A '''taijitu''' ({{lang-zh|t=太極圖|s=太极图|p=tàijítú|w=t'ai⁴chi²t'u²}})  is a [[Character (symbol)|symbol or diagram]] ({{lang|zh|图}} ''tú'') in [[Chinese philosophy]] representing [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] ({{lang|zh|太极}} ''tàijí'' "great pole" or "supreme ultimate") representing both its monist (''[[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]]'') and its dualist ([[yin and yang]]) aspects. Such a diagram was first introduced by  [[Song Dynasty]] [[Neo-Confucianism|philosopher]] [[Zhou Dunyi]] (周敦頤 1017–1073) in his ''Taijitu shuo'' 太極圖說.

The modern [[Taoism|Taoist]] canon, compiled during the [[Ming China|Ming era]], has at least half a dozen variants of such ''taijitu''. The two most similar are the "Taiji [[Xiantiandao|Primal Heaven]]" (太極先天圖 ''tàijí  xiāntiān tú'') and the "[[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]]" (無極圖 ''wújí tú'') diagrams, both of which have been extensively studied during the Qing period for their possible connection with Zhou Dunyi's ''taijitu''.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Adler, ''Reconstructing the Confucian Dao: Zhu Xi's Appropriation of Zhou Dunyi'',  SUNY Press, 2014,
[https://books.google.com/books?id=09ouAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA153 p. 153]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ming period author [[Lai Zhide]] (1525–1604) simplified the ''taijitu'' to a design of two interlocking spirals. In the Ming era, the combination of the two interlocking spirals of the ''taijitu'' with two black-and-white dots superimposed on them became identified with the ''[[Yellow River Map|He tu]]'' or "Yellow River diagram" (河圖). This version was reported in Western literature of the late 19th century as the "Great Monad",&lt;ref&gt;Labelled "The Great Monad" by [[Hampden Coit DuBose]], ''The Dragon, Image, and Demon: Or, The Three Religions of China; Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism'' (1887), [https://archive.org/stream/dragonimageandd00bosegoog#page/n359/mode/2up p. 357]&lt;/ref&gt; and has been widely popularised in Western popular culture as the "yin-yang symbol" since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;"The 'River Diagram' is the pattern of black-and-white dots which appears superimposed on the interlocking spirals [...] Those spirals alone form the ''Taiji tu'' or 'Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate', often known in English since the 1960s as the 'yin-yang symbol'.) These dots were believed to be collated with the eight trigrams, and hence with the concepts of roundness and of the heavens, while the equally numinous 'Luo River Writing' was a pattern of dots accosiated with the number nine, with squareness and with the earth."
Craig Clunas, ''Pictures and Visuality in Early Modern China'' (1997), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q06pemllwx0C&amp;pg=PA107  p. 107].
&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary Chinese term for the modern symbol is {{lang|zh|太极兩儀图}} "two-part Taiji diagram".

[[Unicode]] features the "yin-yang symbol" in the [[Miscellaneous Symbols]] block, at code point U+262F  (YIN YANG ☯). The related "double body symbol" is included at U+0FCA  (TIBETAN SYMBOL NOR BU NYIS -KHYIL ࿊), in the [[Tibetan alphabet|Tibetan]] block.
The [[Soyombo symbol]], that includes a taijitu, is available in Unicode as U+11A9E, 𑪞, U+11A9F, 𑪟, and U+11AA0, 𑪠.

Ornamental patterns with visual similarity to the "yin-yang symbol" are found in archaeological artefacts of [[European prehistory]]; such designs are sometimes descriptively dubbed "yin yang symbols" in archaeological literature by modern scholars.&lt;ref name="Celtic yin yang"&gt;{{harvnb|Peyre|1982|pp=62–64, 82 (pl.

== Structure ==
[[File:ZhoushiTaijitu.png|thumb|right|Ming-era Daoist ''Taijitu'']]
The ''taijitu'' consists of five parts. Strictly speaking, the "yin and yang symbol", itself popularly called ''taijitu'', represents the second of these five parts of the diagram.

*At the top, an empty circle depicts the absolute (''[[Wuji (philosophy)|Wuji]]'')
*A second circle represents the Taiji as harboring Dualism, [[yin and yang]], represented by filling the circle in a black-and-white pattern. In some diagrams, there is a smaller empty circle at the center of this, representing Emptiness as the foundation of duality.
*Below this second circle is a five-part diagram representing the Five Agents (''[[Wu Xing|Wuxing]]''), representing a further stage in the differentiation of Unity into Multiplicity. The Five Agents are connected by lines indicating their proper sequence,  Wood (木) → Fire (火) → Earth (土) → Metal (金) → Water (水).
*The circle below the Five Agents represents the conjunction of Heaven and Earth, which in turn gives rise to the "ten thousand things". This stage is also represented by the Eight Trigrams (''[[Bagua]]'').
*The final circle represents the state of multiplicity, glossed  "The ten thousand things are born by transformation" (萬物化生; modern 化生万物)

== History ==
{{See also|Taiji (philosophy)|Yin and yang}}
The term ''taijitu'' in modern Chinese is commonly used to mean the simple "divided circle" form ([[File:Taijitu - Small (CW).svg|18px]]), but it may refer to any of several schematic diagrams that contain at least one circle with an inner pattern of [[symmetry]] representing [[yin and yang]].

=== Song era ===
While the concept of [[yin and yang]] dates to Chinese antiquity,&lt;ref&gt;in the ''[[I Ching]]'', originally a divination manual of the [[Western Zhou]] period (c. 1000–750 BC),  yin and yang are represented by broken and solid lines: yin is broken (⚋) and yang is solid (⚊).&lt;/ref&gt;
the interest in "diagrams" (圖 ''tú'') is an intellectual fashion of [[Neo-Confucianism]] during the [[Song China|Song period]] (11th century), and it declined again
in the Ming period, by the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Adler152"&gt;Joseph A. Adler, ''Reconstructing the Confucian Dao: Zhu Xi's Appropriation of Zhou Dunyi'',  SUNY Press, 2014,
[https://books.google.com/books?id=09ouAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152 p. 152]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original description of a ''taijitu'' is due to Song era philosopher [[Zhou Dunyi]] (1017–1073), author of the ''Taijitu shuo'' {{lang|zh|太極圖說}} "Explanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate", which became the cornerstone of [[Neo-Confucianist]] cosmology. His brief text synthesized aspects of [[Chinese Buddhism]] and Taoism with [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] discussions in the ''[[Yijing]]''.

Zhou's key terms [[Wuji (philosophy)|Wuji]] and [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] appear in the opening line {{lang|zh|無極而太極}}, which Adler notes could also be translated "The Supreme Polarity that is Non-Polar".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Non-polar (''wuji'') and yet Supreme Polarity (''taiji'')! The Supreme Polarity in activity generates ''yang''; yet at the limit of activity it is still. In stillness it generates ''yin''; yet at the limit of stillness it is also active. Activity and stillness alternate; each is the basis of the other. In distinguishing ''yin'' and ''yang'', the Two Modes are thereby established. The alternation and combination of ''yang'' and ''yin'' generate water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. With these five [phases of] ''qi'' harmoniously arranged, the Four Seasons proceed through them. The Five Phases are simply ''yin'' and ''yang''; ''yin'' and ''yang'' are simply the Supreme Polarity; the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally Non-polar. [Yet] in the generation of the Five Phases, each one has its nature.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Joseph A. (1999). [http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Writings/Chou.htm "Zhou Dunyi: The Metaphysics and Practice of Sagehood"], in ''Sources of Chinese Tradition'', William Theodore De Bary and Irene Bloom, eds. 2nd ed., 2 vols. Columbia University Press. pp. 673–674.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Instead of usual ''Taiji'' translations "Supreme Ultimate" or "Supreme Pole", Adler uses "Supreme Polarity" (see Robinet 1990) because [[Zhu Xi]] describes it as the alternating principle of [[yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']], and ...
&lt;blockquote&gt;insists that ''taiji'' is not a thing (hence "Supreme Pole" will not do). Thus, for both Zhou and Zhu, ''taiji'' is the ''yin-yang'' principle of bipolarity, which is the most fundamental ordering principle, the cosmic "first principle." ''Wuji'' as "non-polar" follows from this. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since the 12th century, there has been a vigorous discussion in Chinese philosophy regarding the ultimate origin of Zhou Dunyi's diagram.
[[Zhu Xi]] (12th century) insists that Zhou Dunyi had composed the diagram himself, against the prevailing view that he had received it from Daoist sources.
Zhu Xi could not accept a Daoist origin of the design, because it would have undermined the claim of uniqueness attached to the Neo-Confucian concept of ''dao''.&lt;ref name="Adler152"/&gt;

While [[Zhou Dunyi]] (1017–1073) popularized the circular diagram,&lt;ref name="Yao2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Xinzhong Yao|title=An introduction to Confucianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tAE2OJ9bPG0C&amp;pg=PA98|accessdate=29 October 2011|date=13 February 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-64430-3|pages=98–}}&lt;/ref&gt; the introduction of "swirling" patterns first appears in the Ming period.

Zhao Huiqian (趙撝謙, 1351–1395) was the first to introduce the "swirling" variant of the ''taijitu'' in his ''Liushu benyi'' (六書本義, 1370s).
The diagram is combined with the eight trigrams (''[[bagua]]'') and called the "River Chart spontaneously generated by Heaven and Earth".
By the end of the Ming period, this diagram had become a widespread representation of [[Chinese cosmology]].&lt;ref&gt;François Louis,
'The Genesis of an Icon: The "Taiji" Diagram's Early History', ''Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies'' 63.11 (June 2003),  145–196.&lt;/ref&gt;
The dots were introduced in the later Ming period (replacing the droplet-shapes used earlier, in the 16th century) and are encountered more frequently in the [[Qing dynasty|Qing period]].&lt;ref&gt;Louis (2003) has diagrams with dots dated to 1623 (p. 187) and 1688 (p. 146, p. 190).&lt;/ref&gt; The dots represent the seed of yin within yang and the seed of yang within yin; the idea that neither can exist without the other. 

Lai Zhide's design is similar to the ''[[Gankyil|gakyil]]'' (''dga' 'khyil'' or "wheel of joy") symbols of [[Tibetan Buddhism]];
but while the Tibetan designs have three or four swirls (representing the [[Three Jewels]] or the [[Four Noble Truths]], i.e. as a [[triskele]] and a [[tetraskelion]] design), Lai Zhide's taijitu has two swirls, terminating in a central circle.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Beer, ''The Handbook of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols'', 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-3804Ud9-4IC&amp;pg=PA209#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 209]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern yin-yang symbol ==
The Ming-era design of the taijitu of two interlocking spirals has been reported as "yin-yang symbol" in the first half of the 20th century.
The [[flag of South Korea]], originally introduced as the flag of [[Joseon]] era Korea in 1882, shows this symbol in red and blue. This was a modernisation of the older (early 19th century) form of the [[Bat Quai Do]] used as the Joseon royal standard.

Since the 1960s, "yin-yang symbol" is most widely applied to the ''He tu'' symbol which combines the two interlocking spirals with two dots.
In the standard form of the contemporary "yin-yang symbol", one draws on the [[diameter]] of a [[circle]] two non-overlapping circles each of which has a diameter equal to the [[radius]] of the outer circle.

The [[Soyombo symbol]] of Mongolia may be prior to 1686.
It combines several abstract shapes, including a ''Taiji'' symbol illustrating the mutual complement of man and woman. In socialist times, it was alternatively interpreted as two fish symbolizing vigilance, because fish never close their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pu̇revsambuu |first1=G. |title=Mongolia |location=Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia |publisher=[[Montsame]] |year=2006 |isbn=99929-0-627-8 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, it is generally used to represent the interplay between [[Hard and soft (martial arts)|hard and soft techniques]].

The dots in the modern "yin-yang symbol" have been given the additional interpretation of "intense interaction" between the complementary principles.
&lt;ref&gt;"the yin/yang symbol so familiar to us contains a white dot amid the black and a black dot amid the white to indicate that these principles interact intensely." Norman R. Kraft, ''Ogdoadic Magick'', Weiser Books, 1969, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Brando''' is a private resort located on the atoll of [[Tetiaroa]] in [[French Polynesia]]. The Brando serves as a regulated airstrip, research facility, eco-resort and spa on the Motu of Onetahi. The resort consists of 80 staff and facilities management personnel.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetCurrentCompany=%5B%2210274106%22%5D LinkedIn]", The Brando, LinkedIn, February 3, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The atoll's inside on which The Brando is located is on a 99-year lease contracted by [[Marlon Brando]].

==Travel==
Traveling to The Brando can only be commercially done by air. Air Teti'aroa flies private planes between the island of [[Tahiti]] and Teti'aroa. The airline's departure is located in a private terminal at the [[Fa'a'ā International Airport]] in Tahiti.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tahitiislandstravel.com/our-experiences/air-tetiaroa Air Tetiaroa]",Tahiti Travel Islands, February 3, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Construction of The Brando Resort began in 2009 by Teti'aroa Pacific Beachcomber SC. The first phase of the building included repairing the airstrip runway for smoother plane landing and lengthening the tarmac to meet current aviation standards. Additionally, a reef dock was constructed to enable shipments from the ocean to the lagoon side of the reef. 

In February 2014, it was announced that construction on The Brando Resort was officially completed. In July 2014, The Brando was officially open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://howtospendit.ft.com/destinations/48103-marlon-brandos-private-island-escape-in-polynesia the Brando opening in July 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Eight of [[Marlon Brando]]’s eleven children were involved in the project along with the Brando Estate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/guymartin/2015/01/06/an-island-named-desire-11000-per-night-bungalows-on-marlon-brandos-tahitian-hideaway/ The Brando, Forbes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
The buildings are made using materials that are of local or certified origin, renewable, or recycled. There is a deep seawater air-conditioning (SWAC) system to reduce energy demands.
Renewable energy sources such as solar power (from [[PV panel]]s) and coconut oil ([[biofuel]]) are used.
The [[Zinc–bromine_battery|zinc-bromine&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energystorageexchange.org/projects/1038 Tetiaroa Brando Resort battery type]&lt;/ref&gt; flow batteries]] (used for storing the power from the PV panels) are made from recyclable materials.

{{italic title}}
'''''The Expulsion of the Albanians'''''{{Cref2|a}} ({{lang-sr|Исељавање Арнаута}}/''Iseljavanje Arnauta'') was a lecture presented by the Yugoslav historian [[Vaso Čubrilović]] (1897–1990) on 7 March 1937.&lt;ref name="Petersen2011"/&gt; The text elaborates on the ethnic composition dynamics of [[Kosovo]] and other Albanian populated areas within Yugoslavia from medieval times to present. While explaining why any previous methods put in place by the Yugoslav authorities to overturn the ethnic majority of the Albanians in those areas, such as slow colonization or agrarian reforms, had failed so far, it suggested in details a radical solution, the mass expulsion of Albanians. The expulsion was seen by Čubrilović as a [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] measure, as to prevent potential [[Greater Albania|Albanian irredentism]].

==Background==
In the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], Albanians were concentrated in the [[Kosovo]] region.&lt;ref name=Mylonas-163/&gt;

In 1923, [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|Greece and Turkey made a successful population exchange]]. In early 1936, Turkey was interested in signing an agreement for the resettlement of 200,000 Muslims from Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=Mylonas-163/&gt;

The idea, however, persisted. Vaso Čubrilović, a respected historian, wrote in a March 7, 1937, government memorandum entitled "The Expulsion of the Albanians", "It is impossible to repel the Albanians just by gradual colonization...The only possibility and method is the brutal power of a well-organized state... We have already stressed that for us the only efficient way is the mass deportation of the Albanians out of their triange".}}{{dubious-inline|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Čubrilović proposed that the Albanians be forced to emigrate free willingly through harassment and [[Colonisation of Kosovo|settling of Serbs]], calling the state for help to make the ''"Arnaut suffer as much as he can"''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Danijela Nadj |url=http://www.hic.hr/books/jugoistocna-europa/velikesrbije.htm#vs |title=Medjunarodni znanstveni skup "Jugoistocna Europa 1918.-1995."

A ruthless collection of taxes would be used and all public schools be closed. Albanian homes and villages could be burnt down, referring to the [[1877–78 expulsions of Albanians]] in [[Niš]] and [[Kuršumlija]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Čubrilović described that the Chetniks and paramilitaries could be of good use where they would pressure the Albanians to leave, making it "the most effective means".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Their land was to be confiscated and given to Montenegrin and Serb settlers and thus change the ethnic structure.&lt;ref name="Kostovicova2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr Denisa Kostovicova|title=Kosovo: The Politics of Identity and Space|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mtHSCXYFpYkC&amp;pg=PA151|date=9 October 2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-27632-5|pages=151–}}&lt;/ref&gt; These methods would result in ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The International Journal of Albanian Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBUWAQAAMAAJ|publisher=Department of Political Science, Columbia University|page=37|year=1997| volume=1| issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"At a time when Germany can expel tens of thousands of Jews and Russia can shift millions of people from one part of the continent to another, the expulsion of a few hundred thousand Albanians will not lead to the outbreak of a world war. However, those who decide should know what they want and persist in achieving this, regardless of the possible international obstacles."'' | Čubrilović &lt;ref name="Mestrovic2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stjepan Mestrovic|title=Genocide After Emotion: The Post-Emotional Balkan War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CdTcAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44|date=13 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-16349-4|pages=44–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Čubrilović believed that the Albanians were fanatic, superstitious and that previous expulsion plans, like those enacted within the wider Niš region during 1878 in areas such as the [[Toplica (river)|Toplica]] and the [[Morava Valley]]s, was the only effective way.

==Aftermath and legacy==
The programme was difficult to put into practice because of the economical and political situation at the time. The April War and the collapse of Yugoslavia stopped it and the document remained hidden in archives for years. Čubrilović's paper was "erased" by the Communist authorities because they believed that "all non-Slavic" people should be incorporated into Yugoslavia. The International community found the document in the 1960s which was then given to Albanian President [[Enver Hoxha]] who used it to criticize the Yugoslav authorities, who denied that such a document even existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Danijela Nadj |url=http://www.hic.hr/books/jugoistocna-europa/velikesrbije.htm |title=Medjunarodni znanstveni skup "Jugoistocna Europa 1918.-1995." Ideologija Velike Srbije |website=Hic.hr |date= |accessdate=2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document was mentioned and published in January 1988 in the Belgrade newspaper ''[[Borba (newspaper)|Borba]]'', and later in [[Zagreb]]-based magazine ''Start''. Čubrilović's document was not supported by Yugoslav historians and professors except for [[Ivo Andrić]]. The text was later often quoted and cited as one of the fundamental documents of the [[Greater Serbia]] ideology in the 20th century; that is the basis for methods that were used during the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] by the Serbian authorities for the purpose of ethnic cleansing of Albanians, [[Muslims (nationality)|Muslims]], and [[Croats]].  Some authors believe that Čubrilović's plan to expel Albanians from Kosovo actualized in 1999 by [[Slobodan Milošević]]'s government under the name "[[Operation Horseshoe]]".&lt;ref name="Sell2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis Sell|title=Slobodan Milosevic and the Destruction of Yugoslavia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fu1QiZ1n5AgC&amp;pg=PA304|date=4 August 2003|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-3223-X|pages=304–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nin.co.rs/2002-07/18/24142.html |title=NIN / Da li je postojao "Plan potkovica" |website=Nin.co.rs |date=1999-07-16 |accessdate=2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report is deemed chauvinistic and nationalistic and was used as a reference to the Serbian atrocities in Kosovo in 1999 by [[Joe DioGuardi]] as he spoke to the US parliament demanding that the United States should be launching [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO-attacks against Yugoslavia]]. During the campaign of ethnic cleansing, over 850,000 Albanians left Kosovo, but soon returned after the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops.

[[File:Tipu's Tiger front view 2006AH4173.jpg|thumb|Tipu's Tiger in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|V&amp;A Museum]], London showing the prostrate European being attacked]]
'''Tipu's Tiger''' or '''Tippu's Tiger''' is an eighteenth-century [[automaton]] or mechanical toy created for [[Tipu Sultan]], the  ruler of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] in India. The carved and painted wood casing represents a tiger savaging a near life-size European man. Mechanisms inside the tiger and man's bodies make one hand of the man move, emit a wailing sound from his mouth and grunts from the tiger. In addition a flap on the side of the tiger folds down to reveal the keyboard of a small [[pipe organ]] with 18 notes.

The tiger was created for Tipu and makes use of his personal emblem of the tiger and expresses his hatred of his enemy, the British of the [[East India Company]]. The tiger was discovered in his [[Tipu Sultan's Summer Palace|summer palace]] after East India Company troops [[Battle of Seringapatam|stormed Tipu's capital]] in 1799. The [[Governor-General of India|Governor General]], [[Lord Mornington]] sent the tiger to Britain initially intending it to be an exhibit in the [[Tower of London]]. First exhibited to the London public in 1808 in [[East India House]], then the offices of the East India Company in London, it was later transferred to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (V&amp;A) in 1880 (accession number 2545(IS)).&lt;ref name="V&amp;A web"&gt;{{cite web

==Background==
[[File:Tipu's Tiger with keyboard on display 2006AH4168.jpg|thumb|Tipu's Tiger with the organ keyboard visible]]
Tipu's Tiger was originally made for Tipu Sultan (also referred to as Tippoo Saib, Tippoo Sultan and other epithets in nineteenth-century literature) in the Kingdom of Mysore (today in the Indian state of [[Karnataka]]) around 1795.&lt;ref name="Tiger&amp;Thistle11"/&gt; Tipu Sultan used the tiger systematically as his emblem, employing tiger motifs on his weapons, on the uniforms of his soldiers, and on the decoration of his palaces.&lt;ref name=ModernAsianStudies&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brittlebank | first1 = K. | title = Sakti and Barakat: The Power of Tipu's Tiger. An Examination of the Tiger Emblem of Tipu Sultan of Mysore | journal = Modern Asian Studies | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 257–269 | doi =  10.2307/312813| year = 1995 | pmid =  | pmc = | jstor = 312813 | doi-broken-date = 2018-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His throne rested upon a probably similar life-size wooden tiger, covered in gold; like other valuable treasures it was broken up for the highly organised [[Prize money|prize fund]] shared out between the British army.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p=23}}&lt;ref&gt;Davis, 156-157 on the throne, and 153-157 on the prize fund generally&lt;/ref&gt;

Tipu had inherited power from his father [[Hyder Ali]], a Muslim soldier who had risen to become ''dalwai'' or commander-in-chief under the ruling Hindu [[Wodeyar dynasty]], but from 1760 was in effect the ruler of the kingdom. Hyder, after initially trying to ally with the British against the [[Maratha]]s, had later become their firm enemy, as they represented the most effective obstacle to his expansion of his kingdom, and Tipu grew up with violently anti-British feelings.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|pp=23-24}}

The tiger formed part of a specific group of large [[caricature]] images commissioned by Tipu showing European, often specifically British, figures being attacked by tigers or elephants, or being executed, tortured and humiliated and attacked in other ways. Many of these were painted by Tipu's orders on the external walls of houses in the main streets of Tipu's capital, [[Seringapatam]].{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p=24}} Tipu was in "[[Franco-Indian alliances#Proposals of Tippu Sahib|close co-operation]]" with the French, who were at war with Britain and still had [[French India|a presence]] in South India, and some of the French craftsmen who visited Tipu's court probably contributed to the internal works of the tiger.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|pp=24-25}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically about half an inch thick, and now much reinforced on the inside following bomb damage in World War II. There are many openings at the head end, formed to match the pattern of the inner part of the painted tiger stripes, which allow the sounds from the pipes within to be heard better, and the tiger is "obviously male". The top part of the tiger's body can be lifted off to inspect the mechanics by removing four screws. The construction of the human figure is similar but the wood is much thicker.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p=66}} Examination and analysis by the V&amp;A conservation department has determined that much of the current paint has been restored or overpainted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/6099083 V&amp;A Conservation in Action - Tippoo's Tiger] video, accessed, 17 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The human figure is clearly in European costume, but authorities differ as to whether it represents a soldier or civilian; the current text on the V&amp;A website avoids specifying, other than describing the figure as "European".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/asia/object_stories/Tippoo's_tiger/index.html Tippoo's Tiger on Victoria &amp; Albert Museum website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825074241/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/asia/object_stories/Tippoo's_tiger/index.html |date=25 August 2006 }}; to Ord-Hume he is "a European soldier" (Part 1, 21), but to de Almeida and Gilpin he is "an English gentleman" (p. 35)&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation of a crank handle powers several different mechanisms inside Tipu's Tiger. A set of bellows expels air through a pipe inside the man's throat, with its opening at his mouth. This produces a wailing sound, simulating the cries of distress of the victim. A mechanical link causes the man's left arm to rise and fall. This action alters the pitch of the 'wail pipe'. Another mechanism inside the tiger's head expels air through a single pipe with two tones. This produces a "regular grunting sound" simulating the roar of the tiger. Concealed behind a flap in the tiger's flank is the small ivory keyboard of a two-stop pipe organ in the tiger's body, allowing tunes to be played.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, summarized at p. 64 and throughout in more detail.&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of both shell and workings, and analysis of the metal content of the original brass pipes of the organ (many have been replaced), indicates that the tiger was of local manufacture. The presence of French artisans and French army engineers within Tipu's court has led many historians to suggest there was French input into the mechanism of this automaton.&lt;ref name=Archer&gt;{{cite book

==History==
[[File:Tipu's Tiger Salmond 1800.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The first published illustration of Tipu's Tiger in [[James Salmond]]'s book of 1800]]
Tipu's Tiger was part of the extensive plunder from Tipu's palace captured in the fall of Seringapatam, in which Tipu died, on 4 May 1799, at the culmination of the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]]. An ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' to the Governor General of the East India Company, [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley]], wrote a memorandum describing the discovery of the object:&lt;ref&gt;The St James's Chronicle, April 1800; also reported in the Edinburgh Caledonian Mercury 24 April 1800.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stronge|2009|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"In a room appropriated for musical instruments was found an article which merits particular notice, as another proof of the deep hate, and extreme loathing of Tippoo Saib towards the English. This piece of mechanism represents a royal Tyger in the act of devouring a prostrate European. There are some barrels in imitation of an Organ, within the body of the Tyger. The sounds produced by the Organ are intended to resemble the cries of a person in distress intermixed with the roar of a Tyger. The machinery is so contrived that while the Organ is playing, the hand of the European is often lifted up, to express his helpless and deplorable condition. The whole of this design was executed by Order of Tippoo Sultaun. It is imagined that this memorial of the arrogance and barbarous cruelty of Tippoo Sultan may be thought deserving of a place in the Tower of London."}}

The earliest published drawing of Tippoo's Tyger was the frontispiece for the book "A Review of the Origin, Progress and Result, of the Late Decisive War in Mysore with Notes" by [[James Salmond]], published in London in 1800. It preceded the move of the exhibit from India to England and had a separate preface titled "Description of the Frontispiece" which said:&lt;ref name="Tiger&amp;Thistle24"&gt;As quoted in {{cite web |url=http://www.tigerandthistle.net/thistle24.htm|title=2.4 Tippoo's Tiger: Frontispiece |author=Wood, Col Mark |year=2000 |website=The Tiger and the Thistle - Tipu Sultan and the Scots in India |publisher=The National Galleries of Scotland. |accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"This drawing is taken from a piece of mechanism representing a royal tyger in the act of devouring a prostrate European. There are some barrels in imitation of an organ within the body of the tyger, and a row of keys of natural notes. The sounds produced by the organ are intended to resemble the cries of a person in distress, intermixed with the roar of a tyger. The machinery is so contrived, that while the organ is playing, the hand of the European is often lifted up to express his helpless and deplorable condition.

The whole of this design is as large as life, and was executed by order of Tippoo Sultaun, who frequently amused himself with a sight of this emblematic triumph of the Khoodadaud, over the English, Sircar. The piece of machinery was found in a room of the palace at Seringapatam appropriated for the reception of musical instruments, and called the Rag Mehal.

The original wooden figure from which the drawing is taken will be forwarded, by the ships of this season, to the Chairman of the Court of Directors, to be presented to his Majesty. It is imagined that this characteristic emblem of the ferocious animosity of Tippoo Sultaun against the British Nation may not be thought undeserving of a place in the Tower of London."}}

Unlike Tipu's throne, which also featured a large tiger, and many other treasures in the palace, the materials of Tipu's Tiger had no intrinsic value, which together with its striking iconography is what preserved it and brought it back to England essentially intact. The Governors of the East India Company had at first intended to present the tiger to the Crown, with a view to it being displayed in the [[Tower of London]], but then decided but to keep it for the Company. After some time in store, during which period the first of many "misguided and wholly unjustified endeavours at "improving" the piece" from a musical point of view may have taken place, it was displayed in the reading-room of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] Museum and Library at [[East India House]] in [[Leadenhall Street]], London from July 1808.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|pp=29-31}}&lt;ref&gt;153-157&lt;/ref&gt;

It rapidly became a very popular exhibit, and the crank-handle controlling the wailing and grunting could apparently be freely turned by the public.

When the East India Company was taken over by the Crown in 1858, the tiger was stored in Fife House, [[Whitehall]] until 1868, when it moved down the road to the new [[India Office]], which occupied part of the building still used by today's [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]. In 1874 it was moved to the India Museum in [[South Kensington]], which was in 1879 dissolved, with the collection distributed between other museums; the V&amp;A records the tiger as acquired in 1880. During World War II the tiger was badly damaged by a German bomb which brought down the roof above it, breaking the wooden casing into several hundred pieces, which were carefully pieced together after the war, so that by 1947 it was back on display. In 1955 it was exhibited in New York at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] through the summer and spring.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 1, 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Keats-Shelley"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=30210016 |title=News and Notes|author=Mann, Phyllis G. |journal=Keats-Shelley Journal, Vol 6.

In recent times, Tipu's Tiger has formed an essential part of museum exhibitions exploring the historical interface between Eastern and Western civilisation, colonialism, ethnic histories and other subjects, one such being held at the Victoria and Albert Museum itself in autumn 2004 titled "Encounters:the meeting of Asia and Europe, 1500&amp;ndash;1800".&lt;ref name="Jaffer (2007)"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jaffer |first1=Amin |editor1-first=Francisco José |editor1-last=Gomes |others=Alexandra Curvelo, Clare Anderson , Bhaswati Bhattacharya , Kévin Le Doudic , Momin Chaudhury , Samuel Berthet , Bhagwan S.

Today Tipu's Tiger is arguably the best-known single work in the Victoria and Albert Museum as far as the general public is concerned. It is a "must-see" highlight for school-children's visits to the Victoria and Albert Museum, and functions as an iconic representation of the museum, replicated in various forms of memorabilia in the museum shops including [[postcard]]s, model kits and stuffed toys.&lt;ref name=KrommBakewell2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=KrommBakewell2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kromm|first1=Jane|last2=Bakewell|first2=Susan Benforado|title=A history of visual culture: Western civilization from the 18th to the 21st century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bO2scveOMokC&amp;pg=PA272|accessdate=17 July 2011|date=2 February 2010|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84520-492-1|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors can no longer operate the mechanism since the device is now kept in a glass case.

The British hunted tigers, not just to emulate the [[Mughals]] and other local elites in this "royal" sport, but also as a symbolic defeat of Tipu Sultan and any other ruler who stood in the path of British domination.&lt;ref name=Sramek2006/&gt; The tiger motif was used in the "Seringapatam medal" which was awarded to those who participated in the 1799 campaign, where the British lion was depicted as overcoming a prostrate tiger, the tiger being the dynastic symbol of Tipu's line. The Seringapatam medal was issued in gold for the highest dignitaries who were associated with the campaign as well as select officers on general duty, silver for other dignitaries, field officers and other staff officers, in copper-[[bronze]] for the non-commissioned officers and in [[tin]] for the privates. On the reverse it had a frieze of the storming of the fort while the obverse showed, in the words of a nineteenth-century tome on medals, "the BRITISH LION subduing the TIGER, the emblem of the late Tippoo Sultan's government, with the period when it was effected and the following words 'ASSUD OTTA-UL GHAULIB', signifying the Lion of God is the conqueror, or the conquering Lion of God."&lt;ref name="Carter_1893_Medals"&gt;{{Cite book |publisher = Norie and Wilson |publication-place = London |title = War medals of the British army, and how they were won |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL14047956M/War_medals_of_the_British_army_and_how_they_were_won. |last= Carter |first= Thomas |authorlink= Thomas Carter (writer) |edition = War medals of the British army, and how they were won. |publication-date = 1893 |accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tipu's Tiger is also notable as a literal image of a tiger killing a European, an important symbol in England at the time, and from about 1820 the "Death of Munro" became one of the scenes in the repertoire of [[Staffordshire pottery]] figurines.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p=26}}&lt;ref name="de Almeida, 38"/&gt; Tiger-hunting in the [[British Raj]], is also considered to represent not just the political subjugation of India, but in addition, the triumph over India's environment.&lt;ref name=Sramek2006/&gt; The iconography persisted and during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion of 1857]], [[Punch (magazine)|Punch]] ran a political cartoon showing the Indian rebels as a tiger, attacking a victim in an identical pose to Tipu's Tiger, being defeated by the British forces shown by the larger figure of a lion.

Motives for collection of articles, such as Tipu's Tiger, are seen by literary historian Barrett Kalter as having a social and cultural context.&lt;ref name="Kalter 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kalter |first1=Barrett  |last2= |first2= |year=2008 |title=Review Essay: "Shopping, Collecting, and Feeling at Home" |journal=Eighteenth-Century Fiction |volume=20 |issue=3, Article 11 |pages= 469–477|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/eighteenth_century_fiction/v020/20.3.kalter.html |doi= 10.1353/ecf.0.0008|accessdate=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of Western and Indian art by Tipu Sultan is seen by Kalter as motivated by the need to display his wealth and legitimise his authority over his subjects who were predominantly Hindu and did not share his religion, viz. Islam.&lt;ref name="Kalter 2008"/&gt; In the case of the East India Company, collection of documents, artefacts and ''objet's d'art''&amp;nbsp; from India helped develop the idea of a subjugated Indian populace in the minds of the British people, the thought being that the possession of such objects of a culture represented understanding of, dominance over, and mastery of that culture.&lt;ref name="Kalter 2008"/&gt;

==As a musical instrument==
[[File:Tipu Sultan's Tiger.JPG|thumb|Side view, showing how the handle when turned gets in the way of the player of the keyboard]]

In a detailed study published in 1987 of the tiger's musical and noise-making functions, Arthur W.J.G. Ord-Hume concluded that since coming to Britain, "the instrument has been ruthlessly reworked, and in doing so much of its original operating principles have been destroyed".&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 1, 31, though his main discussion of the matter is in his Part 2.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two ranks of pipes in the organ (as opposed to the wailing and grunting functions), each "comprising eighteen notes, [which] are nominally of 4ft pitch and are [[unison]]s - i.e. corresponding pipes in each register make sounds of the same musical pitch. This is an unusual layout for a pipe organ although while selecting the two stops together results in more sound ... there is also detectable a slight beat between the pipes so creating a [[Voix céleste|celeste]] effect. ... it is considered likely that as so much work has been done ... this characteristic may be more an accident of tuning than an intentional feature".{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987b|p=69}} The tiger's grunt is made by a single pipe in the tiger's head and the man's wail by a single pipe emerging at his mouth and connected to separate [[bellows]] located in the man's chest, where they can be accessed by unbolting and lifting off the tiger. The grunt operates by cogs gradually raising the weighted "grunt-pipe" until it reaches a point where it slips down "to fall against its fixed lower-board or reservoir, discharging the air to form the grunting sound"{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987b|pp=64-66, photos 67-68}} Today all the sound-making functions rely on the crank-handle to power them, though Ord-Hume believes this was not originally the case.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p= 66}}

Works on the noise-making functions included those made over several decades by the famous organ-building firm [[Henry Willis &amp; Sons]], and Henry Willis III, who worked on the tiger in the 1950s, contributed an account to a monograph by Mildred Archer of the V&amp;A. Ord-Hume is generally ready to exempt Willis work from his scathing comments on other drastic restorations, which "vandalism" is assumed to be by unknown earlier organ-builders.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 1, 30, and Part 2 ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;
There was a detailed account of the sound-making functions in ''[[The Penny Magazine]]'' in 1835, whose anonymous author evidently understood "things mechanical and organs in particular".&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 75, preceding his full reproduction of the text.&lt;/ref&gt; From this and Ord-Hume's own investigations, he concluded that the original operation of the man's "wail" had been intermittent, with a wail only being produced after every dozen or so grunts from the tiger above, but that at some date after 1835 the mechanism had been altered to make the wail continuous, and that the bellows for the wail had been replaced with smaller and weaker ones, and the operation of the moving arm altered.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p= 66}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/8973957 video] of [[David Dimbleby]] playing the grunt and wail only&lt;/ref&gt;

Puzzling features of the present instrument include the placing of the handle, which when turned is likely to obstruct a player of the keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 1, 21&lt;/ref&gt; Ord-Hume, using the 1835 account, concludes that originally the handle (which is a nineteenth-century British replacement, probably of a French original) only operated the grunt and wail, while the organ was operated by pulling a string or cord to work the original bellows, now replaced.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 71, 73, 75, 77, and see videos linked at the end of the section&lt;/ref&gt; The keyboard, which is largely original, is "unique in construction", with "square ivory buttons" with round [[lathe]]-turned tops instead of conventional keys. Though the mechanical functioning of each button is "practical and convenient" they are spaced such that "it is almost impossible to stretch the hand to play an octave".&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 69, 73, and see videos linked at the end of the section&lt;/ref&gt; The buttons are marked with small black spots, differently placed but forming no apparent pattern in relation to the notes produced and corresponding to no known system of marking keys.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 69, and see videos linked at the end of the section&lt;/ref&gt; The two stop control knobs for the organ are located, "rather confusingly", a little below the tiger's testicles.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 64&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument is now rarely played, but there is a V&amp;A video of a recent performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/6699473 Vimeo.com] ''Conservation in Action - Playing Tippoo's Tiger Part 2'', and [http://vimeo.com/6099330 ''Part 1'', with the top of the tiger removed], accessed 17 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tunnel''' is an underground passageway, dug through the surrounding soil/earth/rock and enclosed except for entrance and exit, commonly at each end. A [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] is not a tunnel, though some recent tunnels have used [[immersed tube]] construction techniques rather than traditional tunnel boring methods.

A tunnel may be for foot or vehicular road [[traffic]], for [[rail transport|rail]] traffic, or for a [[canal]]. The central portions of a [[rapid transit]] network are usually in tunnel. Some tunnels are [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] to supply water for consumption or for [[hydroelectric]] stations or are [[sanitary sewer|sewers]]. [[Utility tunnel]]s are used for routing steam, chilled water, electrical power or telecommunication cables, as well as connecting buildings for convenient passage of people and equipment.

Secret tunnels are built for military purposes, or by civilians for [[smuggling]] of [[weapon]]s, [[contraband]], or [[people]]. Special tunnels, such as [[wildlife crossing]]s, are built to allow wildlife to cross human-made barriers safely. Tunnels can be connected together in [[tunnel network]]s.

== Terminology ==
A tunnel is relatively long and narrow; the length is often much greater than twice the [[diameter]], although similar shorter excavations can be constructed, such as cross passages between tunnels.

The definition of what constitutes a tunnel can vary widely from source to source. For example, the definition of a road tunnel in the [[United Kingdom]] is defined as "a subsurface highway structure enclosed for a length of {{convert|150|m|ft}} or more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=DESIGN MANUAL FOR ROADS AND BRIDGES: VOLUME 2: SECTION 2: PART 9: BD 78/99: DESIGN OF ROAD TUNNELS|year=1999|publisher=The Department for Transport|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/ha/standards/dmrb/vol2/section2/bd7899.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[National Fire Protection Association|NFPA]] definition of a tunnel is "An underground structure with a design length greater than {{convert|23|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a diameter greater than {{convert|1800|mm|ft}}."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=NFPA Standard for Safeguarding Construction, Alteration, and Demolition Operations|publisher=National Fire Protection Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, a pedestrian, cycle or animal tunnel beneath a road or railway is called a '''[[Subway (underpass)|subway]]''', while an underground railway system is differently named in different cities, the "[[London Underground|Underground]]" or the "[[London Underground|Tube]]" in [[London]], the "[[Glasgow Subway|Subway]]" in [[Glasgow, Scotland|Glasgow]], and the "[[Tyne and Wear Metro|Metro]]" in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].  The place where a road, railway, canal or watercourse passes under a footpath, cycleway, or another road or railway is most commonly called a '''[[bridge]]''' or, if passing under a canal, an '''[[Aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]]'''.  Where it is important to stress that it is passing underneath, it may be called an '''underpass''', though the official term when passing under a railway is an '''[[underbridge]]'''.  A longer underpass containing a road, canal or railway is normally called a "tunnel", whether or not it passes under another item of infrastructure.  An underpass of any length under a river is also usually called a "tunnel", whatever mode of transport it is for.

In the US, the term "subway" means an underground rapid transit system, and the term '''[[pedestrian underpass]]''' is used for a passage beneath a barrier. Rail station platforms may be connected by pedestrian tunnels or [[footbridge]]s.

[[File:Joralemon Street Tunnel postcard, 1913.jpg|thumb|Joralemon Street Tunnel on 1913 postcard, part of the [[New York City Subway]] system]]

Much of the early technology of tunneling evolved from [[mining]] and [[military engineering]]. The [[etymology]] of the terms "mining" (for mineral extraction or for [[mining (military)|siege attacks]]), "military engineering", and "[[civil engineering]]" reveals these deep historic connections.

=== Antique and early middle ages ===
Predecessors of modern tunnels were [[adit]]s to transport water for [[irrigation]] or drinking, and [[sewerage]]. The first [[Qanat]]s are known from before 2000 B.C.

== Geotechnical investigation and design ==
{{Main article|Geotechnical investigation}}
A major tunnel project must start with a comprehensive investigation of ground conditions by collecting samples from [[borehole]]s and by other geophysical techniques. An informed choice can then be made of machinery and methods for excavation and ground support, which will reduce the risk of encountering unforeseen ground conditions. In planning the route, the horizontal and vertical alignments can be selected to make use of the best ground and water conditions. It is common practice to locate a tunnel deeper than otherwise would be required, in order to excavate through solid rock or other material that is easier to support during construction.

Conventional desk and preliminary site studies may yield insufficient information to assess such factors as the blocky nature of rocks, the exact location of fault zones, or the stand-up times of softer ground. This may be a particular concern in large-diameter tunnels. To give more information, a pilot tunnel (or "drift tunnel") may be driven ahead of the main excavation. This smaller tunnel is less likely to collapse catastrophically should unexpected conditions be met, and it can be incorporated into the final tunnel or used as a backup or emergency escape passage. Alternatively, horizontal boreholes may sometimes be drilled ahead of the advancing tunnel face.

Other key geotechnical factors:
* "Stand-up time" is the amount of time a newly excavated cavity can support itself without any added structures. Knowing this parameter allows the engineers to determine how far an excavation can proceed before support is needed, which in turn affects the speed, efficiency, and cost of construction. Generally, certain configurations of rock and clay will have the greatest stand-up time, while sand and fine soils will have a much lower stand-up time.&lt;ref&gt;Bickel. (1995). Tunnel engineering handbook, 2nd edition. CBS Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Groundwater]] control is very important in tunnel construction. Water leaking into a tunnel or vertical shaft will greatly decrease stand-up time, causing the excavation to become unstable and risking collapse. The most common way to control groundwater is to install dewatering pipes into the ground and to simply pump the water out.&lt;ref&gt;Powers, P.J. (2007). Construction de-watering and groundwater control. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; A very effective but expensive technology is [[ground freezing]], using pipes which are inserted into the ground surrounding the excavation, which are then cooled with special refrigerant fluids. This freezes the ground around each pipe until the whole space is surrounded with frozen soil, keeping water out until a permanent structure can be built.
* Tunnel [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional shape]] is also very important in determining stand-up time. If a tunnel excavation is wider than it is high, it will have a harder time supporting itself, decreasing its stand-up time. A square or rectangular excavation is more difficult to make self-supporting, because of a concentration of [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] at the corners.&lt;ref name="Engineers. 1978"/&gt;

=== Choice of tunnels versus bridges ===
{{Anchor|Choice of tunnels vs bridges}}
[[File:2007 09 19 - 895tunnel - WB 3.JPG|right|thumb|The [[Harbor Tunnel (Baltimore)|Harbor Tunnel]] in [[Baltimore]], which carries [[Interstate 895 (Maryland)|I-895]], serves as an example of a water-crossing tunnel built instead of a bridge.]]
For water crossings, a tunnel is generally more costly to construct than a bridge. However, navigational considerations may limit the use of high bridges or [[drawbridge]] spans intersecting with shipping channels, necessitating a tunnel.

Bridges usually require a larger footprint on each shore than tunnels. In areas with expensive real estate, such as [[Manhattan]] and urban [[Hong Kong]], this is a strong factor in favor of a tunnel. Boston's [[Big Dig]] project replaced elevated roadways with a tunnel system to increase traffic capacity, hide traffic, reclaim land, redecorate, and reunite the city with the waterfront.

The 1934 [[Queensway Tunnel]] under the [[River Mersey]] at [[Liverpool]] was chosen over a massively high bridge for defense reasons; it was feared that aircraft could destroy a bridge in times of war. Maintenance costs of a massive bridge to allow the world's largest ships to navigate under were considered higher than for a tunnel. Similar conclusions were reached for the 1971 [[Kingsway Tunnel]] under the Mersey. In [[Hampton Roads, Virginia]], tunnels were chosen over bridges for strategic considerations; in the event of damage, bridges might prevent [[US Navy]] vessels from leaving [[Naval Station Norfolk]].

Water-crossing tunnels built instead of bridges include the [[Holland Tunnel]] and [[Lincoln Tunnel]] between [[New Jersey]] and Manhattan in [[New York City]]; the [[Queens-Midtown Tunnel]] between Manhattan and the [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Queens]] on [[Long Island]]; the [[Detroit-Windsor Tunnel]] between [[Michigan]] and [[Ontario, Canada|Ontario]]; and the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]] tunnels between [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] and [[Portsmouth, Virginia]]; the 1934 [[River Mersey]] road [[Queensway Tunnel]]; the [[Western Scheldt Tunnel]], Zeeland, Netherlands; and the [[North Shore Connector]] tunnel in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].

Other reasons for choosing a tunnel instead of a bridge include avoiding difficulties with tides, weather, and shipping during construction (as in the {{convert|51.5|km|mi|adj=on|disp=or}} [[Channel Tunnel]]), aesthetic reasons (preserving the above-ground view, landscape, and scenery), and also for weight capacity reasons (it may be more feasible to build a tunnel than a sufficiently strong bridge).

Some water crossings are a mixture of bridges and tunnels, such as the [[Oresund Bridge|Denmark to Sweden link]] and the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel]] in [[Virginia]].

There are particular hazards with tunnels, especially from vehicle fires when combustion gases can [[asphyxia]]te users, as happened at the [[Gotthard Road Tunnel#2001 collision and fire|Gotthard Road Tunnel]] in [[Switzerland]] in 2001. One of the worst railway disasters ever, the [[Balvano train disaster]], was caused by a train stalling in the Armi tunnel in [[Italy]] in 1944, killing 426 passengers. Designers try to reduce these risks by installing emergency ventilation systems or isolated emergency escape tunnels parallel to the main passage.

=== Project planning and cost estimates ===
Government funds are often required for the creation of tunnels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cord.edu/faculty/bfoss/ADVC20.htm |title=Capital Projects Funds |publisher=Cord.edu |accessdate=19 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217080357/http://www.cord.edu/faculty/bfoss/ADVC20.htm |archivedate=17 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a tunnel is being planned or constructed, economics and politics play a large factor in the decision making process. Civil engineers usually use [[project management]] techniques for developing a major structure. Understanding the amount of time the project requires, and the amount of labor and materials needed is a crucial part of project planning. The project duration must be identified using a [[work breakdown structure]] (WBS) and [[critical path method]] (CPM). Also, the land needed for excavation and construction staging, and the proper machinery must be selected. Large infrastructure projects require millions or even billions of dollars, involving long-term financing, usually through issuance of [[Bond (finance)|bonds]].

The [[Cost–benefit analysis|costs and benefits]] for an infrastructure such as a tunnel must be identified. Political disputes can occur, as in 2005 when the US House of Representatives approved a $100 million federal grant to build a tunnel under New York Harbor. However, the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] was not aware of this bill and had not asked for a grant for such a project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/03/nyregion/03rail.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Sewell | last=Chan | title=$100 Million for a Tunnel. What Tunnel? | date=3 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Increased taxes to finance a large project may cause opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/infrastructure/encouraging-us-infrastructure-investment/p27771 |title=Encouraging U.S. Infrastructure Investment – Council on Foreign Relations |publisher=Cfr.org |accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
{{Main article|Tunnel construction}}
{{anchor|Construction}}
{{anchor|Cut-and-cover}}
Tunnels are dug in types of materials varying from soft clay to hard rock. The method of tunnel construction depends on such factors as the ground conditions, the ground water conditions, the length and diameter of the tunnel drive, the depth of the tunnel, the logistics of supporting the tunnel excavation, the final use and shape of the tunnel and appropriate risk management.

There are three basic types of tunnel construction in common use. Cut-and-cover tunnels are constructed in a shallow trench and then covered over. Bored tunnels are constructed in situ, without removing the ground above. Finally a tube can be sunk into a body of water, which is called an immersed tunnel.

=== Cut-and-cover ===&lt;!--links from Charles Pearson --&gt;&lt;!--linked from [[Cut-and-cover]]--&gt;
[[File:Paris Metro construction 03300288-3.jpg|thumb|Cut-and-cover construction of the [[Paris Métro]] in [[France]]]]

'''Cut-and-cover''' is a simple method of construction for shallow tunnels where a [[trench]] is excavated and [[roof]]ed over with an overhead support system strong enough to carry the load of what is to be built above the tunnel.{{sfn|Ellis|2015|p=118}}
Two basic forms of cut-and-cover tunnelling are available:
* ''Bottom-up method'': A trench is excavated, with ground support as necessary, and the tunnel is constructed in it. The tunnel may be of in situ concrete, precast concrete, precast arches, or corrugated steel arches; in early days brickwork was used. The trench is then carefully back-filled and the surface is reinstated.
* ''Top-down method'': Side support walls and capping beams are constructed from ground level by such methods as [[slurry wall]]ing or contiguous bored piling. Then a shallow excavation allows making the tunnel roof of precast beams or in situ concrete. The surface is then reinstated except for access openings. This allows early reinstatement of roadways, services and other surface features. Excavation then takes place under the permanent tunnel roof, and the base slab is constructed.

Shallow tunnels are often of the cut-and-cover type (if under water, of the immersed-tube type), while deep tunnels are excavated, often using a [[tunnelling shield]]. For intermediate levels, both methods are possible.

Large cut-and-cover boxes are often used for underground [[Rapid transit|metro]] stations, such as [[Canary Wharf tube station]] in London. This construction form generally has two levels, which allows economical arrangements for ticket hall, station platforms, passenger access and emergency egress, ventilation and smoke control, staff rooms, and equipment rooms. The interior of Canary Wharf station has been likened to an underground cathedral, owing to the sheer size of the excavation. This contrasts with many traditional stations on [[London Underground]], where bored tunnels were used for stations and passenger access. Nevertheless, the original parts of the London Underground network, the Metropolitan and District Railways, were constructed using cut-and-cover. These lines pre-dated electric traction and the proximity to the surface was useful to ventilate the inevitable smoke and steam.

A major disadvantage of cut-and-cover is the widespread disruption generated at the surface level during construction. This, and the availability of electric traction, brought about London Underground's switch to bored tunnels at a deeper level towards the end of the 19th century.

=== Boring machines ===
{{Main article|Tunnel boring machine}}
[[File:TBM S-210 Alptransit Faido East.jpg|thumb|A workman is dwarfed by the [[tunnel boring machine]] used to excavate the [[Gotthard Base Tunnel]] ([[Switzerland]]), the world's longest railway tunnel.]]

Tunnel boring machines (TBMs) and associated back-up systems are used to highly automate the entire tunnelling process, reducing tunnelling costs. In certain predominantly urban applications, tunnel boring is viewed as quick and cost effective alternative to laying surface rails and roads. Expensive [[eminent domain|compulsory purchase]] of buildings and land, with potentially lengthy planning inquiries, is eliminated. Disadvantages of TBMs arise from their usually large size – the difficulty of transporting the large TBM to the site of tunnel construction, or (alternatively) the high cost of assembling the TBM on-site, often within the confines of the tunnel being constructed.

There are a variety of TBM designs that can operate in a variety of conditions, from hard rock to soft water-bearing ground. Some types of TBMs, the bentonite slurry and earth-pressure balance machines, have pressurised compartments at the front end, allowing them to be used in difficult conditions below the [[water table]]. This pressurizes the ground ahead of the TBM cutter head to balance the water pressure. The operators work in normal air pressure behind the pressurised compartment, but may occasionally have to enter that compartment to renew or repair the cutters. This requires special precautions, such as local ground treatment or halting the TBM at a position free from water. Despite these difficulties, TBMs are now preferred over the older method of tunnelling in compressed air, with an air lock/decompression chamber some way back from the TBM, which required operators to work in high pressure and go through decompression procedures at the end of their shifts, much like [[underwater diving|deep-sea divers]].

In February 2010, Aker Wirth delivered a TBM to Switzerland, for the expansion of the [[Linth–Limmern Power Stations]] located south of [[Linthal, Glarus|Linthal]] in the [[canton of Glarus]]. The borehole has a diameter of {{convert|8.03|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tunnelsonline.info/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=61846 |title=Tunnels &amp; Tunnelling International |publisher=Tunnelsonline.info |accessdate=19 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316162001/http://www.tunnelsonline.info/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=61846 |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The four TBMs used for excavating the {{convert|57|km|mi|adj=on}} [[Gotthard Base Tunnel]], in [[Switzerland]], had a diameter of about {{convert|9|m|ft}}. A larger TBM was built to bore the Green Heart Tunnel (Dutch: Tunnel Groene Hart) as part of the [[HSL-Zuid]] in the Netherlands, with a diameter of {{convert|14.87|m|ft|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hslzuid.nl/hsl/uk/bouw/ment/Bored_Tunnel_Groene_Hart/index.jsp |title=The Groene Hart Tunnel |publisher=Hslzuid.nl |accessdate=19 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925160241/http://www.hslzuid.nl/hsl/uk/bouw/ment/Bored_Tunnel_Groene_Hart/index.jsp |archivedate=25 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn was superseded by the [[Autopista de Circunvalación M-30|Madrid M30 ringroad]], [[Spain]], and the [[Shanghai Yangtze River Tunnel and Bridge|Chong Ming]] tunnels in [[Shanghai]], [[China]]. All of these machines were built at least partly by [[Herrenknecht]]. {{As of|2013|August|}}, the world's largest TBM is "[[Bertha (tunnel boring machine)|Big Bertha]]", a {{convert|57.5|ft|adj = on}} diameter machine built by [[Hitachi Zosen Corporation]], which is digging the [[Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel]] in [[Seattle, Washington]] (US).&lt;ref name="NYT Dec 2012"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/05/us/projects-to-transform-seattle-all-along-the-waterfront.html |title=Engineering Projects Will Transform Seattle, All Along the Waterfront |newspaper=The New York Times |date=4 December 2012 |first=Kirk |last=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clay-kicking ===
Clay-kicking is a specialised method developed in the [[United Kingdom]] of digging tunnels in strong clay-based soil structures. Unlike previous manual methods of using [[mattock]]s which relied on the soil structure to be hard, clay-kicking was relatively silent and hence did not harm soft clay-based structures. The clay-kicker lies on a plank at a 45-degree angle away from the working face and inserts a tool with a cup-like rounded end with the feet. Turning the tool manually, the kicker extracts a section of soil, which is then placed on the waste extract.

Used in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] civil engineering, the method found favour in the renewal of Britain's ancient [[sewerage]] systems, by not having to remove all property or infrastructure to create a small tunnel system. During the [[First World War]], the system was used by [[Royal Engineer tunnelling companies]] to put mines beneath the [[German Empire]] lines. The method was virtually silent and so not susceptible to listening methods of detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tunnellersmemorial.com/Tunnelling.htm |title=Tunnelling |publisher=tunnellersmemorial.com |accessdate=20 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823081917/http://tunnellersmemorial.com/Tunnelling.htm |archivedate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shafts ===
[[File:Mersey Railway Tunnel - ventilation and drainage machinery.png|right|thumb|1886 illustration showing the ventilation and drainage system of the Mersey railway tunnel]]
A temporary access [[Shaft (civil engineering)|shaft]] is sometimes necessary during the excavation of a tunnel. They are usually circular and go straight down until they reach the level at which the tunnel is going to be built. A shaft normally has concrete walls and is usually built to be permanent. Once the access shafts are complete, TBMs are lowered to the bottom and excavation can start. Shafts are the main entrance in and out of the tunnel until the project is completed. If a tunnel is going to be long, multiple shafts at various locations may be bored so that entrance to the tunnel is closer to the unexcavated area.&lt;ref name="Engineers. 1978"&gt;United States Army Corps of Engineers. (1978). Tunnels and shafts in rock. Washington, DC: Department of the Army.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once construction is complete, construction access shafts are often used as [[ventilation shaft]]s, and may also be used as emergency exits.

=== Sprayed concrete techniques ===
The [[New Austrian Tunnelling method|New Austrian Tunneling Method]] (NATM) was developed in the 1960s and is the best known of a number of engineering practices that use calculated and empirical measurements to provide safe support to the tunnel lining. The main idea of this method is to use the geological [[stress (physics)|stress]] of the surrounding [[Rock (geology)|rock]] [[mass]] to stabilize the tunnel, by allowing a measured relaxation and stress reassignment into the surrounding rock to prevent full loads becoming imposed on the supports. Based on [[geotechnical]] measurements, an optimal [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] is computed. The excavation is protected by a layer of sprayed concrete, commonly referred to as [[shotcrete]]. Other support measures can include steel arches, rockbolts and mesh. Technological developments in sprayed concrete technology have resulted in steel and polypropylene fibres being added to the concrete mix to improve lining strength. This creates a natural load-bearing ring, which minimizes the rock's [[Deformation (mechanics)|deformation]].

[[File:Hill 60 illowra battery port kembla.jpg|thumb|[[Illowra Battery]] utility tunnel, Port Kembla. One of many [[Template:Barracks Batteries Bunkers and Forts in Sydney|bunkers south of Sydney]].]]

By special [[Condition monitoring|monitoring]] the NATM method is flexible, even at surprising changes of the [[geomechanics|geomechanical]] rock consistency during the tunneling work. The measured rock properties lead to appropriate [[tool]]s for tunnel [[Strength of materials|strengthening]]. In the last decades also soft ground excavations up to {{convert|10|km|mi}} became usual.

=== Pipe jacking ===
{{Main article|Pipe jacking}}

In '''[[pipe jacking]]''', [[hydraulic jack]]s are used to push specially made pipes through the ground behind a TBM or shield. This method is commonly used to create tunnels under existing structures, such as roads or railways. Tunnels constructed by pipe jacking are normally small diameter bores with a maximum size of around {{convert|3.2|m}}.

=== Box jacking ===
Box jacking is similar to pipe jacking, but instead of jacking tubes, a box-shaped tunnel is used. Jacked boxes can be a much larger span than a pipe jack, with the span of some box jacks in excess of {{convert|20|m}}. A cutting head is normally used at the front of the box being jacked, and spoil removal is normally by excavator from within the box.Recent developments of the Jacked Arch and Jacked deck have enabled longer and larger structures to be installed to close accuracy. The 126m long 20m clear span underpass below the high speed rail lines at Cliffsend in Kent, UK is an example of this technique{{citation-needed|date=June 2018}}.

=== Underwater tunnels ===
[[File:Georgiaaquariumtunnel.jpg|thumb|[[Shark tunnel]] at the [[Georgia Aquarium]]]]
{{Main article|Undersea tunnel}}

There are also several approaches to underwater tunnels, the two most common being bored tunnels or [[immersed tube]]s, examples are [[Bjørvika Tunnel]] and [[Marmaray]]. [[Submerged floating tunnel]]s are a novel approach under consideration; however, no such tunnels have been constructed to date.

=== Temporary way ===
During construction of a tunnel it is often convenient to install a temporary railway, particularly to remove [[spoil tip|excavated spoil]], often [[narrow gauge]] so that it can be [[double track]] to allow the operation of empty and loaded trains at the same time. The temporary way is replaced by the [[permanent way]] at completion, thus explaining the term "Perway".

=== Enlargement ===
[[File:Kolektory Praha, 15.jpg|thumb|A utility tunnel in [[Prague]]]]

The vehicles or traffic using a tunnel can outgrow it, requiring replacement or enlargement:
* The original single line [[Mount Gibraltar|Gib Tunnel]] near [[Mittagong]] was replaced with a double-track tunnel, with the original tunnel used for growing mushrooms. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} 
* The 1832 double-track mile-long tunnel from [[Edge Hill railway station|Edge Hill]] to [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Lime Street]] in [[Liverpool]] was near totally removed, apart from a 50-metre section at Edge Hill and a section nearer to Lime Street, as four tracks were required. The tunnel was dug out into a very deep four-track cutting, with short tunnels in places along the cutting. Train services were not interrupted as the work progressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i34.tinypic.com/23ixthy.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2 April 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304114308/http://i34.tinypic.com/23ixthy.jpg |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i36.tinypic.com/16k1ahx.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2 April 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185533/http://i36.tinypic.com/16k1ahx.jpg |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are other occurrences of tunnels being replaced by open cuts, for example, the [[Auburn Tunnel]].
* The [[Farnworth Tunnel]] in England was enlarged using a [[tunnel boring machine]] (TBM) in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Railway Magazine]] August 2015, p12.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rhyndaston Tunnel]] was enlarged using a borrowed TBM so as to be able to take [[ISO container]]s.
* Tunnels can also be enlarged by lowering the floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tunnel-online.info/en/artikel/tunnel_2012-04_Report_on_Redeveloping_Railway_Tunnels_1433844.html|title=Report on Redeveloping Railway Tunnels|website=www.tunnel-online.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Open building pit ===
An open building pit consists of a horizontal and a vertical boundary that keeps groundwater and soil out of the pit. There are several potential alternatives and combinations for (horizontal and vertical) building pit boundaries. The most important difference with cut-and-cover is that the open building pit is muted after tunnel construction; no roof is placed.

=== Other construction methods ===

* [[Drilling and blasting]]
* [[Hydraulic splitter]]
* Slurry-shield machine
* Wall-cover construction method.

=== Double-deck and multipurpose tunnels ===
[[File:San Francisco-Bay Bridge02.jpg|thumb|The upper level traffic lanes through [[Yerba Buena Island]], part of the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]]]]
Some tunnels are double-deck, for example the two major segments of the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]] (completed in 1936) are linked by a {{convert|540|foot|m|adj=mid}} [[Yerba Buena Tunnel|double-deck tunnel]] section through [[Yerba Buena Island]], the largest-diameter bored tunnel in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge|url=http://mtc.ca.gov/about-mtc/what-mtc/bay-area-toll-authority/san-francisco-oakland-bay-bridge|work=Bay Area Toll Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt; At construction this was a combination bidirectional rail and truck pathway on the lower deck with automobiles above, now converted to one-way road vehicle traffic on each deck.

In Turkey, the [[Eurasia Tunnel]] under the [[Bosphorus]], opened in 2016, has at its core a {{convert|5.4|km|mile|abbr=on}} two-deck road tunnel with two lanes on each deck.&lt;ref name="uc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://events.unicredit-cib.eu/uploads/media/Presentation_Basar_Arioglu_Yapi_Merkezi_Insaat.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120170635/http://events.unicredit-cib.eu/uploads/media/Presentation_Basar_Arioglu_Yapi_Merkezi_Insaat.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 January 2016 |publisher=[[Unicredit]] – Yapı Merkezi, SK EC Joint Venture |title=Eurasia Tunnel Project |accessdate=13 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The French [[A86 Duplex Tunnel]] in west Paris consists of two bored tunnel tubes, the eastern one of which has two levels for light motorized vehicles, over a length of {{convert|10|km|mile|abbr=on}}. Although each level offers a physical height of {{convert|2.54|m|foot|abbr=on}}, only traffic up to {{convert|2|m|foot|abbr=on}} tall is allowed in this tunnel tube, and motorcyclists are directed to the other tube. Each level was built with a three-lane roadway, but only two lanes per level are used – the third serves as a hard shoulder within the tunnel. The A86 Duplex is Europe's longest double-deck tunnel.

In [[Shanghai]], China, a {{convert|2.8|km|mile|abbr=on}} two-tube double-deck tunnel was built starting in 2002. In each tube of the [[Fuxing Road Tunnel]] both decks are for motor vehicles. In each direction, only cars and taxis travel on the {{convert|2.6|m|foot|abbr=on}} high two-lane upper deck, and heavier vehicles, like trucks and buses, as well as cars, may use the {{convert|4.0|m|foot|abbr=on}} high single-lane lower level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/China/47409.htm|title=Shanghai to Dig Double-deck Tunnel|date=15 May 2006|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515033120/http://www.china.org.cn/english/China/47409.htm|archivedate=15 May 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the 1934 [[Queensway Tunnel]] under the [[River Mersey]] between [[Liverpool]] and [[Birkenhead]] was originally to have road vehicles running on the upper deck and trams on the lower. During construction the tram usage was cancelled. The lower section is only used for cables, pipes and emergency accident refuge enclosures.

Hong Kong's [[Lion Rock Tunnel]], built in the mid 1960s, connecting [[New Kowloon]] and [[Sha Tin New Town|Sha Tin]], carries a motorway but also serves as an [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]], featuring a gallery containing five water mains lines with diameters between 1.2m and 1.5m below the road section of the tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterworld.com/articles/2009/08/black--veatch-uses.html|title=Black &amp; Veatch uses trenchless technology for water main rehabilitation in Hong Kong – WaterWorld|date=5 June 2017|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170605114200/http://www.waterworld.com/articles/2009/08/black--veatch-uses.html|archivedate=5 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some tunnels have more than one purpose. The [[SMART Tunnel]] in [[Malaysia]] is the first multipurpose "''Stormwater Management And Road Tunnel''" in the world, created to convey both traffic and occasional [[flood]] waters in [[Kuala Lumpur]]. When necessary, floodwater is first diverted into a separate bypass tunnel located ''underneath'' the {{convert|2.5|mile|km|abbr=on}} double-deck roadway tunnel. In this scenario, traffic continues normally. Only during heavy, prolonged rains when the threat of extreme flooding is high, the upper tunnel tube is closed off to vehicles and automated flood control gates are opened so that water can be diverted through both tunnels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mnn.com/green-tech/transportation/stories/drive-through-these-10-tremendous-tunnels|title=Drive through these 10 tremendous tunnels|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Common utility duct]]s or utility tunnels carry two or more utility lines. Through co-location of different utilities in one tunnel, organizations are able to reduce the costs of building and maintaining utilities.

=== Covered passageways ===
[[File:Sotetkapu.JPG|right|thumb|upright|The 19th century [[Dark Gate]] in [[Esztergom]], [[Hungary]]]]

Over-bridges can sometimes be built by covering a road or river or railway with brick or steel arches, and then leveling the surface with earth. In railway parlance, a surface-level track which has been built or covered over is normally called a "covered way".

[[Snow shed]]s are a kind of artificial tunnel built to protect a railway from [[avalanche]]s of snow. Similarly the [[Stanwell Park]], [[New South Wales]] "steel tunnel", on the [[Illawarra railway line]], protects the line from rockfalls.

== Safety and security ==
[[File:Alma tunnel Paris.jpg|thumb|left| The entrance to the Pont de l'Alma tunnel, the site where [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana]]'s car hit a Fiat and then the wall. There was no proper barrier and this contributed to her death]]

Owing to the enclosed space of a tunnel, fires can have very serious effects on users. The main dangers are gas and smoke production, with even low concentrations of [[carbon monoxide]] being highly toxic. Fires killed 11 people in the [[Gotthard Road Tunnel#History|Gotthard tunnel fire]] of 2001 for example, all of the victims succumbing to smoke and gas inhalation. Over 400 passengers died in the [[Balvano train disaster]] in Italy in 1944, when the locomotive halted in a long tunnel. [[Carbon monoxide poisoning]] was the main cause of death. In the [[Caldecott Tunnel fire]] of 1982, the majority of fatalities were caused by toxic smoke, rather than by the initial crash.

Motor vehicle tunnels usually require [[ventilation shaft]]s and powered fans to remove toxic [[exhaust gas]]es during routine operation.&lt;ref name="Mishra"&gt;{{cite journal

Rail tunnels usually require fewer [[air changes per hour]], but still may require [[Ventilation (architecture)|forced-air ventilation]]. Both types of tunnels often have provisions to increase ventilation under emergency conditions, such as a fire. Although there is a risk of increasing the [[rate of combustion]] through increased airflow, the primary focus is on providing breathable air to persons trapped in the tunnel, as well as [[firefighter]]s.

When there is a parallel, separate tunnel available, airtight but unlocked emergency doors are usually provided which allow trapped personnel to escape from a smoke-filled tunnel to the parallel tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fridolf | first1 = K. | last2 = Ronchi | first2 = E. | last3 = Nilsson | first3 = D. | last4 = Frantzich | first4 = H. | year = 2013 | title = Movement speed and exit choice in smoke-filled rail tunnels | url = | journal = Fire Safety Journal | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 8–21 | doi = 10.1016/j.firesaf.2013.03.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larger, heavily used tunnels, such as the [[Big Dig]] tunnel in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], may have a dedicated 24-hour manned [[operations center]] which monitors and reports on traffic conditions, and responds to emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Christine M.|author2=Edward L.

Earthquakes are one of nature’s most formidable threats. A magnitude 6.7 earthquake shook the San Fernando valley in Los Angeles in 1994. The earthquake caused extensive damage to various structures including buildings, freeway overpasses and road systems throughout the area. The National Center for Environmental Information estimates total damages to be 40 billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/results?bt_0=1994&amp;st_0=1994&amp;type_17=EXACT&amp;query_17=150&amp;op_12=eq&amp;v_12=USA&amp;type_12=Or&amp;query_14=CA&amp;type_3=Like&amp;query_3=northridge&amp;st_1=&amp;bt_2=&amp;st_2=&amp;bt_1=&amp;bt_4=&amp;st_4=&amp;bt_5=&amp;st_5=&amp;bt_6=&amp;st_6=&amp;bt_7=&amp;st_7=&amp;bt_8=&amp;st_8=&amp;bt_9=&amp;st_9=&amp;bt_10=&amp;st_10=&amp;type_11=Exact&amp;query_11=&amp;type_16=Exact&amp;query_16=&amp;bt_18=&amp;st_18=&amp;ge_19=&amp;le_19=&amp;type_20=Like&amp;query_20=&amp;display_look=1&amp;t=101650&amp;s=1&amp;submit_all=Search+Database|title=Significant Earthquakes Full Search, sort by Date, Country|first=Paula|last=Dunbar|website=www.ngdc.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an article issued by Steve Hymon of TheSource – Transportation News and Views, there was no serious damage sustained by the LA subway system. Metro, the owner of the LA subway system, issued a statement through their engineering staff about the design and consideration that goes into a tunnel system. Engineers and architects perform extensive analysis as to how hard they expect earthquakes to hit that area. All of this goes into the overall design and flexibility of the tunnel. 

This same trend of limited subway damage following an earthquake can be seen in many other places. In 1985 a magnitude 8.1 earthquake shakes Mexico City; there is no damage to the subway system, and in fact the subway systems serve as a lifeline for emergency personnel and evacuations. A magnitude 7.2 rips through Kobe Japan in 1995, leaving no damage to the tunnels themselves. Entry portals sustained minor damages, however these damages were attributed to inadequate earthquake design that originated from the original construction date of 1965. In 2010 a magnitude 8.8, massive by any scale, absolutely annihilates Chile. Entrance stations to subway systems suffered minor damages, and the subway system was down for the rest of the day. By the next afternoon, the subway system was operational again.&lt;ref&gt;Hymon, Steve. "Designing A Subway to Withstand an Earthquake." The Source. N.p., 2017.

The history of ancient tunnels and tunneling in the world is reviewed in various sources which include many examples of these structures that were built for different purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Grewe, 1998, Licht am Ende des Tunnels – Planung und Trassierung im antiken Tunnelbau, Verlag Philipp von Zabern, Mainz am Rhein.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siamak Hashemi, 2013, The Magnificence of Civilization in Depths of Ground (A Review of Underground Structures in Iran – Past to Present), Shadrang Printing and Publishing Co., Tehran.&lt;/ref&gt; Some well known ancient and modern tunnels are briefly introduced below:
* The [[qanat]] or [[kareez]] of [[Persia]] are water management systems used to provide a reliable supply of water to human settlements or for irrigation in hot, arid and semi-arid climates. The deepest known qanat is in the Iranian city of [[Gonabad]], which after 2700 years, still provides drinking and agricultural water to nearly 40,000 people. Its main well depth is more than {{convert|360|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and its length is {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO World Heritage Centre – World Heritage List: Qanats of Gonabad, Date of Inscription 2007, Reference No. 5207, At: {{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/fr/listesindicatives/5207 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=14 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329120845/http://whc.unesco.org/fr/listesindicatives/5207 |archivedate=29 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Siloam Tunnel]] was built before 701 [[Common Era|BCE]] for a reliable supply of water, to withstand [[siege]] attacks.
* The [[Eupalinian aqueduct]] on the island of [[Samos Island|Samos]] ([[North Aegean]], [[Greece]]) was built in 520 BCE by the ancient Greek engineer [[Eupalinos]] of [[Megara]] under a contract with the local community. Eupalinos organised the work so that the tunnel was begun from both sides of Mount Kastro. The two teams advanced simultaneously and met in the middle with excellent accuracy, something that was extremely difficult in that time. The aqueduct was of utmost defensive importance, since it ran underground, and it was not easily found by an enemy who could otherwise cut off the water supply to [[Pythagoreion]], the ancient capital of [[Samos Island|Samos]]. The tunnel's existence was recorded by Herodotus (as was the mole and harbour, and the third wonder of the island, the great temple to Hera, thought by many to be the largest in the Greek world). The precise location of the tunnel was only re-established in the 19th century by German archaeologists. The tunnel proper is {{convert|1030|m|ft|long|abbr=on|adj=mid}} and visitors can still enter it.
* One of the first known drainage and sewage networks in form of [[Drainage tunnel|tunnels]] was constructed at Persepolis in Iran at the same time as the construction of its foundation in 518 BCE. In most places the network was dug in the sound rock of the mountain and then covered by large pieces of rock and stone followed by earth and piles of rubble to level the ground. During investigations and surveys, long sections of similar rock tunnels extending beneath the palace area were traced by Herzfeld and later by Schmidt and their archeological teams.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, E.F., 1953, Persepolis I – Structures, Reliefs, Inscriptions; The University of Chicago Oriental Institute Publications, Volume LXVIII, The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Via Flaminia]], an important [[Roman road]], penetrated the [[Furlo]] pass in the [[Apennines]] through a tunnel which emperor [[Vespasian]] had ordered built in 76–77 CE. A modern road, the SS 3 Flaminia, still uses this tunnel, which had a precursor dating back to the 3rd century BCE; remnants of this earlier tunnel (one of the first road tunnels) are also still visible.
* The world's oldest tunnel traversing under a water body is claimed&lt;ref&gt;Blogcu {{cite web|url=http://terelek.blogcu.com/terelek-kaya-tuneli/319497 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=17 July 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327222549/http://terelek.blogcu.com/terelek-kaya-tuneli/319497 |archivedate=27 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to be the ''Terelek kaya tüneli'' under [[Kızıl River]], a little south of the towns of [[Boyabat]] and [[Durağan]] in [[Turkey]], just downstream from where [[Kizil River]] joins its tributary [[Gökırmak]]. The tunnel is presently under a narrow part of a lake formed by a dam some kilometers further downstream. Estimated to have been built more than 2000 years ago, possibly by the same civilization that also built the royal tombs in a rock face nearby, it is assumed to have had a defensive purpose. 
* [[Sapperton Canal Tunnel]] on the [[Thames and Severn Canal]] in [[England]], dug through hills, which opened in 1789, was {{convert|3.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and allowed [[Barge|boat]] transport of [[coal]] and other goods.

* [[Fritchley Tunnel]], constructed in 1793 in Derbyshire by the [[Butterley Company]] to transport limestone to its ironworks factory. The Butterley company engineered and built its own railway a victim of the depression the company closed after 219 years in 2009. The tunnel is the world's oldest railway tunnel traversed by rail wagons using gravity and horse haulage. The railway was converted to steam locomotion in 1813 using a [[Steam Horse locomotive]] engineered and built by the Butterley company, however reverted to horses. Steam trains used the tunnel continuously from the 1840s when the railway was converted to a narrow gauge. The line closed in 1933. In the Second World War, the tunnel was used as an air raid shelter. Sealed up in 1977 it was rediscovered in 2013 and inspected. The tunnel was resealed to preserved the construction as it was designated an ancient monument.&lt;ref name=listedbuilding1422984&gt;{{NHLE|num=1422984|desc=Fritchley Tunnel, Butterley Gangroad|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC22342239&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-22342239|title=Archaeologists find 'world's oldest railway tunnel' in Derbyshire|date=1 May 2013|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC22342239/&gt;&lt;ref name=Drummond2013&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2317691/Worlds-oldest-railway-tunnel-hidden-rockery-36-years-discovered-10ft-underground-garden.html|title=World's oldest railway tunnel hidden by a rockery for 36 years is discovered 10ft underground in a back garden|work=Daily Mail|date=1 May 2013|author=James Drummond}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Drummond2013/&gt;
* The 1794 [[Butterley Tunnel|Butterley canal tunnel]] canal tunnel is 3,083 yards (2,819m) in length on the [[Cromford Canal]] in [[Ripley, Derbyshire]], England. The tunnel was built simultaneously with the 1773 [[Fritchley Tunnel|Fritchley railway tunnel]]. The tunnel partially collapsed in 1900 splitting the Cromford Canal, and has not been used since. The Friends of Cromford Canal, a group of volunteers, are working at fully restoring the Cromford Canal and the Butterley Tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cromfordcanal.info Friends of the Cromford Canal – HOME&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023115647/http://www.cromfordcanal.info/ |date=23 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1796 Stoddart Tunnel in Chapel-en-le-Frith in [[Derbyshire]] is reputed to be the oldest rail tunnel in the world. The rail wagons were originally horse-drawn.
* [[Smuggling tunnel#Derby Tunnels|Derby Tunnels]] in [[Salem, Massachusetts]] were built in 1801 to smuggle imports affected by President [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s new customs duties. Jefferson had ordered local militias to help the Custom House in each port collect these dues, but the smugglers, led by Elias Derby, hired the Salem militia to dig the tunnels and hide the spoil. The tunnels ran 3 miles connecting the wharfs in town to an underground train station{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}. Along the way they connected prominent businessmen and politicians homes to their stores, bank, and museums. Members of the Salem Commons Fund hid the tunnels behind a project to fill in the ponds and grade the local common. Tunnel dirt was hidden in those ponds and was used to fill in rivers to create new wharfs to connect the tunnels to. Many politicians were involved including a Superior Court Justice, a Secretary of the Navy, and many Senators in the Federalist Party.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}
* A tunnel was created for the first true steam locomotive, from [[Penydarren]] to [[Abercynon]]. The Penydarren locomotive was built by [[Richard Trevithick]]. The locomotive made the historic journey from Penydarren to Abercynon in 1804. Part of this tunnel can still be seen at [[Pentrebach]], [[Merthyr Tydfil]], [[Wales]]. This is arguably the oldest railway tunnel in the world, dedicated only to self-propelled steam engines on rails.
* The [[Montgomery Bell Tunnel]] in Tennessee, an {{convert|88|m|ft|abbr=on|adj=mid|long}} water diversion tunnel, {{convert|4.50|x|2.45|m|ft|adj=mid|high|abbr=on}}, to power a water wheel, was built by slave labour in 1819, being the first full-scale tunnel in North America.
* Bourne's Tunnel, [[Rainhill]], near [[Liverpool]], England. {{convert|0.0321|km|ft|abbr=on}} long. Built in the late 1820s, the exact date is unknown, however probably built in 1828 or 1829. This is the first tunnel in the world constructed under a railway line. The construction of the Liverpool to Manchester Railway ran over a horse-drawn tramway that ran from the Sutton collieries to the Liverpool-Warrington turnpike road. A tunnel was bored under the railway for the tramway. As the railway was being constructed the tunnel was made operational, opening prior to the Liverpool tunnels on the Liverpool to Manchester line. The tunnel was made redundant in 1844 when the tramway was dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-507533-bourne-s-tunnel-at-sj5033491804-|title=Bourne's Tunnel at Sj5033491804 – Saint Helens – St Helens – England|work=British Listed Buildings|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Crown Street railway station|Crown Street station]], [[Liverpool]], England, 1829. Built by [[George Stephenson]], a single track railway tunnel {{convert|266|m|ft|adj=mid|long|abbr=on}}, was bored from Edge Hill to Crown Street to serve the world's first intercity passenger railway terminus station. The station was abandoned in 1836 being too far from Liverpool city centre, with the area converted for freight use. Closed down in 1972, the tunnel is disused.

* The 1829 [[Wapping Tunnel]] in Liverpool, England at {{convert|2.03|km|mi|abbr=on}} long on a twin track railway, was the first rail tunnel bored under a metropolis. The tunnel's path is from Edge Hill in the east of the city to [[Wapping Dock]] in the south end Liverpool docks. The tunnel was used only for freight terminating at the [[Park Lane railway goods station|Park Lane goods terminal]]. Currently disused since 1972, the tunnel was to be a part of the [[Merseyrail]] metro network, with work started and abandoned because of costs. The tunnel is in excellent condition and is still being considered for reuse by Merseyrail, maybe with an underground station cut into the tunnel for Liverpool university. The river portal is opposite the new [[Echo Arena Liverpool|King's Dock Liverpool Arena]] being an ideal location for a serving station. If reused the tunnel will be the oldest used underground rail tunnel in the world and oldest section of any underground metro system.&lt;ref name="subbrit.org.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forgottenrelics.co.uk/tunnels/gallery/wapping.html|title=Wapping Tunnel|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maund"&gt;{{cite book |title= Merseyrail electrics: the inside story |author=Maund, T.B. |publisher= NBC Books |year=2001 |location=Sheffield |oclc=655126526}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1832, [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Lime Street railway station]] tunnel, Liverpool. A two track rail tunnel, {{convert|1.811|km|mi|abbr=on}} long was bored under the metropolis from Edge Hill in the east of the city to Lime Street in Liverpool's city centre. The tunnel was in use from 1832 being used to transport building materials to the new Lime St station while under construction. The station and tunnel was opened to passengers in 1836. In the 1880s the tunnel was converted to a deep cutting, open to the atmosphere, being four tracks wide. This is the only occurrence of a major tunnel being removed. Two short sections of the original tunnel still exist at Edge Hill station and further towards Lime Street, giving the two tunnels the distinction of being the oldest rail tunnels in the world still in use, and the oldest in use under streets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hows.org.uk/personal/rail/incline/lls.htm Liverpool Lime St&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031133/http://www.hows.org.uk/personal/rail/incline/lls.htm |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time a {{convert|525|m|mi|abbr=on}} section of the deep cutting has been converted back into tunnel due to sections having buildings built over. 
* [[Box Tunnel]] in England, which opened in 1841, was the longest railway tunnel in the world at the time of construction. It was dug by hand, and has a length of {{convert|2.9|km|mi|abbr=on}}.
* The {{convert|1.1|km|mi|abbr=on}} 1842 Prince of Wales Tunnel, in [[Shildon]] near Darlington, England, is the oldest sizeable tunnel in the world still in use under a settlement.
* The [[Victoria_Tunnel_(Newcastle)| Victoria Tunnel Newcastle]] opened in 1842, is a 2.4 mile subterranean wagonway with a maximum depth of {{convert|85|ft|0}} that drops {{convert|222|ft|0}} from entrance to exit. The tunnel runs under Newcastle upon Tyne, England, and originally exited at the River Tyne.  It remains largely intact. Originally designed to carry coal from [[Spital Tongues]] to the river, in WW2 part of the tunnel was used as a shelter. Under the management of a charitable foundation called the Ouseburn Trust it is currently used for heritage tours.

* The [[Thames Tunnel]], built by [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] and his son [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] opened in 1843, was the first tunnel (after Terelek) traversing under a water body, and the first to be built using a [[tunnelling shield]]. Originally used as a foot-tunnel, the tunnel was converted to a railway tunnel in 1869 and was a part of the [[East London Line]] of the [[London Underground]] until 2007. It was the oldest section of the network, although not the oldest purpose built rail section. From 2010 the tunnel became a part of the [[London Overground]] network.
* The {{convert|3.34|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Victoria Tunnel (Liverpool)|Victoria Tunnel]]/[[Waterloo Tunnel]] in [[Liverpool]], England, was bored under a metropolis opening in 1848. The tunnel was initially used only for rail freight serving the Waterloo Freight terminal, and later freight and passengers serving the [[Liverpool Riverside railway station|Liverpool ship liner terminal]]. The tunnel's path is from Edge Hill in the east of the city to the north end Liverpool docks at [[Waterloo Dock (Liverpool)|Waterloo Dock]]. The tunnel is split into two tunnels with a short open air cutting linking the two. The cutting is where the cable hauled trains from Edge Hill were hitched and unhitched. The two tunnels are effectively one on the same centre line and are regarded as one. However, as initially the {{convert|2375|m|mi|abbr=on}} long Victoria section was originally cable hauled and the shorter {{convert|862|m|yd|abbr=on}} Waterloo section was locomotive hauled, two separate names were given, the short section was named the [[Waterloo Tunnel]]. In 1895 the two tunnels were converted to locomotive haulage. Used until 1972, the tunnel is still in excellent condition. A short section of the Victoria tunnel at Edge Hill is still used for shunting trains. The tunnel is being considered for reuse by the [[Merseyrail]] network. Stations cut into the tunnel are being considered and also reuse by a monorail system from the proposed [[Liverpool Waters]] redevelopment of Liverpool's Central Docks has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forgottenrelics.co.uk/tunnels/gallery/victoria.html|title=Victoria Tunnel|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forgottenrelics.co.uk/tunnels/gallery/waterloo.html|title=Waterloo Tunnel|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The vertex tunnel of the [[Semmering railway]], the first Alpine tunnel, was opened in 1848 and was {{convert|1.431|km|mi|abbr=on}} long. It connected rail traffic between [[Vienna]], the capital of [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], and [[Trieste]], its port.
* The [[Giovi Rail Tunnel]] through the [[Appennini]] Mounts opened in 1854, linking the capital city of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], [[Turin]], to its port, [[Genoa]]. The tunnel was {{convert|3.25|km|mi|abbr=on}} long.
* The oldest underground sections of the [[London Underground]] were built using the cut-and-cover method in the 1860s, and opened in January 1863. What are now the [[Metropolitan line|Metropolitan]], Hammersmith &amp; City and Circle lines were the first to prove the success of a [[rapid transit|metro]] or subway system.
*On 18 June 1868, the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific Railroad's]] 1,659-foot (506 m) Summit Tunnel (Tunnel #6) at [[Donner Pass]] in the California [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains was opened, permitting the establishment of the commercial mass transportation of passengers and freight over the Sierras for the first time. It remained in daily use until 1993, when the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] closed it and transferred all rail traffic through the 10,322-foot (3,146 m) long Tunnel #41 (a.k.a. "The Big Hole") built a mile to the south in 1925.
* In 1870, after fourteen years of works, the [[Fréjus Rail Tunnel]] was completed between France and Italy, being the second-oldest Alpine tunnel, {{convert|13.7|km|mi|abbr=on}} long. At that time it was the longest in the world.
* The third Alpine tunnel, the [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel]], between northern and southern Switzerland, opened in 1882 and was the longest rail tunnel in the world, measuring {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}}.
* The 1882 [[Col de Tende Road Tunnel]], at {{convert|3.182|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, was one of the first long road tunnels under a pass, running between France and Italy.
* As the last bit is drilled, on 26 October 2017, [[Ryfast]] becomes the longest undersea road tunnel with its 14.3 km length surpassing that of the tunnel under Tokyo Bay, Japan (9,583 m.), and previously the Shanghai Yangtze River Tunnel (8,950 m.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tu.no/artikler/i-dag-sprenges-siste-fjellrest-vekk-i-verdens-lengste-undersjoiske-veitunnel/410538|title=Nå er siste fjellrest sprengt vekk i verdens lengste undersjøiske veitunnel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tunnel is projected to open for use in 2019.
* The [[Mersey Railway]] tunnel opened in 1886, running from Liverpool to Birkenhead under the River Mersey. The [[Mersey Railway]] was the world's first deep-level underground railway. By 1892 the extensions on land from Birkenhead Park station to Liverpool Central Low level station gave a tunnel {{convert|3.12|mi|km|abbr=on}} in length.

The tunnel is {{convert|10.0|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and at {{convert|2816|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level is the highest active railroad tunnel in the US (the [[Tennessee Pass Line]], currently inactive, and [[Alpine Tunnel]] are higher).
* The [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] opened in 1940 with seven tunnels, most of which were bored as part of the stillborn [[South Pennsylvania Railroad]] and giving the highway the nickname "Tunnel Highway". Four of the tunnels ([[Allegheny Mountain Tunnel|Allegheny Mountain]], [[Tuscarora Mountain Tunnel|Tuscarora Mountain]], [[Kittatinny Mountain Tunnel|Kittatinny Mountain]], and [[Blue Mountain Tunnel|Blue Mountain]]) remain in active use, while the other three ([[Laurel Hill Tunnel|Laurel Hill]], [[Rays Hill Tunnel|Rays Hill]], and [[Sideling Hill Tunnel|Sideling Hill]]) were bypassed in the 1960s; the latter two tunnels are on a bypassed section of the Turnpike now commonly known as the [[Abandoned Pennsylvania Turnpike]].
* The [[Essingeleden|Fredhälls road tunnel]] was opened in 1966, in [[Stockholm, Sweden]], and the [[Elbe Tunnel (1975)|New Elbe road tunnel]] opened in 1975 in [[Hamburg, Germany]]. Both tunnels handle around 150,000 vehicles a day, making them two of the most trafficked tunnels in the world.
* The [[Honningsvåg Tunnel]] ({{convert|4.443|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} long) opened in 1999 on [[European route E69]] in Norway as the world's northernmost road tunnel, except for mines (which exist on [[Svalbard]]).

The use of tunnels for mining is called [[drift mining]].

== Military use ==
{{see also|Sapper}}
Some tunnels are not for transport at all but rather, are fortifications, for example [[Mittelwerk]] and [[Cheyenne Mountain Complex]]. Excavation techniques, as well as the construction of underground bunkers and other habitable areas, are often associated with [[tunnel warfare|military use during armed conflict]], or civilian responses to threat of attack. Another use for tunnels was for the storage of chemical weapons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp1EFlngjKQ |title=Glenbrook Tunnel – Alcatraz Down Under – History Channel |publisher=Youtube.com |accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountains.yourguide.com.au/news/local/news/general/author-lifts-lid-on-chemical-wartime-history/307763.aspx Author lifts lid on chemical wartime history – Local News – News – General – Blue Mountains Gazette&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109001520/http://bluemountains.yourguide.com.au/news/local/news/general/author-lifts-lid-on-chemical-wartime-history/307763.aspx |date=9 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.mustardgas.org/].

== Secret tunnels ==
{{main article|Secret passage|Smuggling tunnel}}
[[File:Underground Railroad Tunnel Door.jpg|thumb|upright|Door to a compartment where runaway slaves would sleep, on the [[Underground Railroad]]]]
[[secret passage|Secret tunnels]] have given entrance to or escape from an area, such as the [[Cu Chi Tunnels]] or the [[Gaza Strip smuggling tunnels|smuggling tunnels in the Gaza Strip]] which connect it to [[Egypt]]. Although the [[Underground Railroad]] network used to transport escaped slaves was "underground" mostly in the sense of secrecy, hidden tunnels were occasionally used. Secret tunnels were also used during the [[Cold War]], under the [[Berlin Wall]] and elsewhere, to smuggle refugees, and for [[espionage]].

[[Smuggler]]s use secret tunnels to transport or store [[contraband]], such as [[illegal drugs]] and [[weapon]]s. Elaborately engineered {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} tunnels built to smuggle drugs across the Mexico-US border were estimated to require up to 9 months to complete, and an expenditure of up to $1 million.&lt;ref name=Audi&gt;{{cite news|last1=Audi|first1=Tamara|title=Drug Tunnels Have Feds Digging for Answers|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323854904578264382749570570|accessdate=4 October 2014|work=Wall Street Journal|date=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these tunnels were equipped with lighting, ventilation, telephones, drainage pumps, hydraulic elevators, and in at least one instance, an electrified rail transport system.&lt;ref name="Audi" /&gt; Secret tunnels have also been used by thieves to break into bank vaults and retail stores after hours.&lt;ref name=Colchester&gt;{{cite news|last1=Colchester|first1=Max|title=Thieves Drill Into Paris Bank Vault|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304739104575153530631794248|accessdate=4 October 2014|work=Wall Street Journal|date=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evans|first1=Peter|title=Where ‘Criminal Underworld’ Is More Than a Euphemism|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/where-criminal-underworld-is-more-than-a-euphemism-1412383000|accessdate=4 October 2014|work=Wall Street Journal|date=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several tunnels have been discovered by the [[Border Security Forces]] across the [[Line of Control]] along the [[India-Pakistan border]], mainly to allow terrorists access to the Indian state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]].&lt;ref name="arniatunnel"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khajuria|first1=Ravi Krishnan|title=Day after India-Pakistan flag meet, BSF detects trans-border tunnel in Jammu’s Arnia sub-sector|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/under-construction-tunnel-being-dug-from-pakistan-side-unearthed-by-bsf-in-jammu/story-B1qgulsJCMQ8FOxWs3LYyO.html|accessdate=10 December 2017 |work=[[Hindustan Times]]|publisher=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sambhatunnel"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Iqbal|first1=Sheikh Zaffar|title=20-Foot Tunnel From Pakistan Found By BSF At Sambha, Jammu and Kashmir|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/20-foot-tunnel-from-pakistan-found-by-bsf-at-sambha-jammu-and-kashmir-1659393|accessdate=10 December 2017|work=[[NDTV]]|date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual usage of [[erdstall]] tunnels is unknown but theories connect it to a rebirth ritual.

== Natural tunnels ==
[[File:Yongmun-gul at Daedunsan.jpg|thumb|upright|View through a natural tunnel in South Korea]]
* [[Lava tube]]s are partially empty, cave-like conduits underground, formed during volcanic eruptions by flowing and cooling lava.
* [[Natural Tunnel State Park]] (Virginia, US) features an {{convert|850|ft|m|sigfig=3|adj=on}} natural tunnel, really a limestone cave, that has been used as a railroad tunnel since 1890.
* [[Punarjani Guha]] in [[Kerala, India]]. Hindus believe that crawling through the tunnel (which they believe was created by a Hindu god) from one end to the other will wash away all of one’s sins and thus allow one to attain rebirth. Only men are permitted to crawl through the tunnel.
* [[Torghatten]], a Norwegian island with a hat-shaped silhouette, has a natural tunnel in the middle of the hat, letting light come through. The {{convert|160|m|ft|adj=on}} long, {{convert|35|m|ft|adj=on}} high, and {{convert|20|m|ft|adj=on}} wide tunnel is said to be the hole made by an arrow of the angry [[troll]] Hestmannen, the hill being the hat of the troll-king of [[Sømna]] trying to save the beautiful [[Lekamøya]]. The tunnel is thought actually to be the work of ice. The sun shines through the tunnel during two few minutes long periods every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Warholm|first1=Harald|title=Hobbyfotografen har ventet tre år på dette sjeldne blinkskuddet|url=http://www.nrk.no/nordland/jubler-over-sjeldent-blinkskudd-av-fjellet-torghatten-1.12034377|accessdate=13 November 2014|work=nrk.no|date=10 November 2014}}The hobby photograph has waited three years for this rare shot of the sun shining through Torghatten mount&lt;/ref&gt;
* Small "snow tunnels" are created by [[vole]]s, [[chipmunk]]s and other [[rodent]]s for protection and access to food sources. For more information regarding tunnels built by animals, see [[Burrow]].

==History==
[[File:Brick Hall, Maine State College, Orono, from Robert N. Dennis collection of stereoscopic views.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Brick Hall (1871), later renamed Oak Hall, burned in 1936]]
The University of Maine was founded in 1862 as a function of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morrill Act]], signed by President [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]. Established in 1865 as the Maine State College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts, the Maine College opened on September 21, 1868 and changed its name to the University of Maine in 1897.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite book|title=The First Century: A History of the University of Maine, 1865&amp;ndash;1965 |last=Smith |first=David C. |publisher=University of Maine at Orono Press |year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1871, curricula had been organized in Agriculture, Engineering, and electives. The Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station was founded as a division of the university in 1887. Gradually the university developed the Colleges of Life Sciences and Agriculture (later to include the School of Forest Resources and the School of Human Development), Engineering and Science, and Arts and Sciences. In 1912 the Maine Cooperative Extension, which offers field educational programs for both adults and youths, was initiated. The School of Education was established in 1930 and received college status in 1958. The School of Business Administration was formed in 1958 and was granted college status in 1965. Women have been admitted into all curricula since 1872. The first master's degree was conferred in 1881; the first doctor's degree in 1960. Since 1923 there has been a separate graduate school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cutler.umaine.edu/about/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909055056/http://www.cutler.umaine.edu/about/history.htm |archivedate=2006-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:UMaine StevensHall.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Stevens Hall]]
Near the end of the 19th century, the university expanded its curriculum to place greater emphasis on [[liberal arts]]. As a result of this shift, faculty hired during the early 20th century included [[Caroline Colvin]], chair of the history department and the nation's first woman to head a major university department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.honors.umaine.edu/community/the-honors-campus/colvin-hall/caroline-colvin/ |title=The University of Maine - Honors College - Caroline Colvin |publisher=The University of Maine |accessdate=2012-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120801205844/http://www.honors.umaine.edu/community/the-honors-campus/colvin-hall/caroline-colvin/ |archivedate=2012-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, [[The Senior Skull Honor Society]] was founded to "publicly recognize, formally reward, and continually promote outstanding leadership and scholarship, and exemplary citizenship within the University of Maine community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umaine.edu/orientation/traditions.htm#skull] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724020101/http://www.umaine.edu/orientation/traditions.htm#skull|date=July 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 16, 1925, 80 women met in Balentine Hall {{mdash}} faculty, alumnae, and undergraduate representatives {{mdash}} to plan a pledging of members to an inaugural honorary organization. This organization was called "The All Maine Women" because only those women closely connected with the University of Maine were elected as members. On April 22, 1925, the new members were inducted into the honor society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umainealumni.com/feed.php?num=6&amp;feed_id=51&amp;news_id=157 |title=UMaine Alumni Association |publisher=Umainealumni.com |accessdate=2012-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322024504/http://www.umainealumni.com/feed.php?num=6&amp;feed_id=51&amp;news_id=157 |archivedate=2012-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the University of Maine System was incorporated, in 1968, the school was renamed by the legislature over the objections of the faculty to the University of Maine at Orono. This was changed back to the University of Maine in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=State of Maine|title=Maine Legislative Document No. 1027, H.P. 717, 112th Legislature|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page]] and the sixteen members of the University of Maine Board of Trustees (of which fifteen are appointed by the Governor of Maine and one is the current Maine State Commissioner of Education). The Board of Trustees has full legal responsibility and authority for the university system. It appoints the Chancellor and each university President, approves the establishment and elimination of academic programs, confers tenure on faculty members, and sets tuition rates/operating budgets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maine.edu/board/index.php |title=University of Maine System &amp;#124; Board of Trustees |publisher=Maine.edu |date=2012-05-16 |accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UMaine is also one of a handful of colleges in the United States whose Student Government is incorporated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umaine.edu/handbook/SOrg/student_government.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616155115/http://www.umaine.edu/handbook/SOrg/student_government.htm|date=June 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student Government was formed in 1978 and incorporated in 1987.

Other organizations fall under the umbrella of Student Government Inc., including representative boards, community associations, and many other student groups. [[The Maine Campus]], the student newspaper, is also incorporated and does not operate under or receive money from student government.

In 1867, the university rejected a campus plan by landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], who designed Central Park in New York City and the White House grounds in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tclf.org/landscapes/university-maine-orono |title=University of Maine at Orono |publisher=The Cultural Landscape Foundation |accessdate=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magarchive.umaine.edu/issues/v2i4/lasting.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611004249/http://www.magarchive.umaine.edu/issues/v2i4/lasting.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-06-11 |title=The University of Maine - UMaine Today - September / October 2002 - Lasting Impression |publisher=Magarchive.umaine.edu |accessdate=2012-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan's broad concepts, including the Front Lawn, were nevertheless adopted during the school's first fifty years, and were oriented toward the Stillwater River. A second master plan was produced in 1932 by Carl Rust Parker of the [[Olmsted Brothers]] firm, which reoriented the campus center to the Mall, an open grassy area between the [[Raymond H. Fogler Library]] and the Memorial Gym.&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;National Register nomination for University of Maine at Orono Historic District, 2010 increase; available by request from the Maine State Historic Preservation Office&lt;/ref&gt; The Mall is further bordered by one residence and five academic halls.

The campus is essentially divided into three sections (northern, southern, and hilltop),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umaine.edu/locator/ |title=The University of Maine - Campus Map |publisher=Umaine.edu |accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which are near or border the Mall. The northern section includes many of the athletic facilities, including the [[Alfond Arena]] (basketball, hockey), [[Alfond Stadium (University of Maine)|Morse Field at the Alfond Sports Stadium]] (football, track and field), [[Larry Mahaney Diamond]] (baseball), Kessock Field (softball), the Field Hockey Complex (field hockey), and the Mahaney athletic/recreational dome. Other buildings on the northern section include the Cutler Health Center, two administrative halls, three residence halls, and multiple academic halls.

The southern section of campus includes the Memorial Student Union, the [[Maynard F. Jordan Observatory]], Lengyel Gymnasium and Athletic Field, the Buchanan Alumni House, as well as multiple administrative, residence, and academic halls. The recently renovated [[Collins Center for the Arts]] is also on the southern part of campus, and not only provides the Hutchins Concert Hall, a 1,435-seat venue for performing artists from around the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collinscenterforthearts.com/pdf/TechnicalInformation.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027004432/http://collinscenterforthearts.com/pdf/TechnicalInformation.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but also houses the [[Hudson Museum]], known for its contemporary [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] art, as well as displays that are culturally specific to the indigenous people of Maine. The Hilltop section of campus is populated largely with residence halls but also includes the {{convert|7|acre|ha|1|adj=on}} Lyle E. Littlefield Ornamental Gardens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umaine.edu/lhc/ornamental.htm |title=Lyle E. Littlefield Ornamental Gardens ..

The campus is also designated as an [[arboretum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://umaine.edu/about/quick-facts-2/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311224242/https://umaine.edu/about/quick-facts-2/ |archivedate=2016-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-1915 core of the campus, covering its earliest period of development, was listed as a [[historic district (United States)|historic district]] on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978; this was expanded to include the second major phase of development (through the end of [[World War II]]) in 2010.&lt;ref name=NRHP/&gt;

===Ambulance Service===
[[Image:UVAC AMBULANCE.jpg|thumb|right|200px|One of the University of Maine's ambulances.]]
The University of Maine operates the "University Volunteer Ambulance Corps," an [[Ambulance]] service licensed by the State of Maine. The service is operated by students and staff of the University. UVAC's ambulances are available to respond to emergencies on campus and also provide mutual aid to surrounding towns and agencies. The service ensures a licensed Emergency Medical Technician is sent on every call. The service has two ambulances both equipped to provide [[Paramedic|Paramedic Level]] care. UVAC responds to approximately 500 calls per school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Sustainability===
The University of Maine is one of 16 colleges and universities listed in ''[[Princeton Review]]'s'' "Green Honor Roll" (2011). Several of the nation's leading research universities, including Virginia Tech, Georgia Tech, Oregon State, Arizona State and the University of Washington are also on that prestigious list, as are Harvard and Northeastern. Recognizing schools for their commitment to sustainability, the Green Honor Roll lists only those 16 institutions that received the highest possible score on ''The Princeton Review'' green rating. The guide lauds UMaine for its recycling programs, green-certified buildings and free shuttle bus service.  It also notes the fact UMaine has a sustainability coordinator, a sustainability council, and "Eco Reps" in its residence halls.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://umaine.edu/news/blog/2011/08/02/princeton-review-fiske-guides-list-umaine-among-nations-best-university-named-to-green-honor-roll/ |title=The University of Maine - UMaine News - Princeton Review, Fiske Guides, Forbes all list UMaine among nation's best; university named to Green Honor Roll |publisher=Umaine.edu |date=2011-08-02 |accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

University of Maine has a sustainability council made up of students, faculty, administrators, staff and a full-time sustainability coordinator. A green loan fund provides capital for energy efficiency and renewable energy investments.&lt;ref name="Understanding and Mitigating the Environmental Footprint of the University of Maine"&gt;{{cite web| title =Understanding and Mitigating the Environmental Footprint of the University of Maine| publisher =University of Maine| url =http://www.climatechange.umaine.edu/Research/MaineClimate/EnFootprint.html| accessdate =2009-10-09| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://archive.is/20121215055935/http://www.climatechange.umaine.edu/Research/MaineClimate/EnFootprint.html| archivedate =2012-12-15| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university has committed to achieving [[carbon neutrality]] by 2040, and two residential-scale solar thermal systems are in place on Nutting Hall and Sebec House.

==Research==

The University of Maine is one of the National Science Foundation's top 100 public universities for research. In FY10, UMaine exceeded $100 million in external expenditures for research — 86% of which was federal funding. Leading sectors of the university in generating external support are advanced materials, marine sciences, climate change, environmental studies, forestry, precision manufacturing, and aquaculture. Undergraduate research is a priority at UMaine, and in 2008, the Center for Undergraduate Research was established to connect students with faculty projects that suit their interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cugr.umaine.edu/|title=Center for Undergraduate Research {{!}} University of Maine|website=cugr.umaine.edu|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Maine has several research areas that operate as independent units under the umbrella of the University of Maine. While these units house and fund faculty, staff, and students from a variety of academic backgrounds and colleges, the research units are independent of the traditional departmental and college structure. The full list of independent research units at the University of Maine include:

=== UMaine Advanced Structures and Composites Center ===

The [[UMaine Advanced Structures and Composites Center]], founded in 1996 with support from the National Science Foundation, provides research, education, and economic development encompassing material sciences, manufacturing and engineering of composites and structures. The center's research and development projects have included the VolturnUS 1:8, composite arch bridge system, and the Modular Ballistic Protection System (MBPS).

The center is the leading member of the [[DeepCwind Consortium]], whose mission is to establish the State of Maine as a national leader in deepwater offshore wind technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://composites.umaine.edu/our-research/offshore-wind/deepcwind-consortium/|title=DeepCwind Consortium {{!}} Advanced Structures &amp; Composites Center {{!}} University of Maine|website=composites.umaine.edu|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UMaine Deepwater Offshore Wind Test Site at Monhegan Island ===
The University of Maine was granted an ocean energy demonstration site through state legislation in 2009. The site, known as the [[UMaine Deepwater Offshore Wind Test Site]], is available for use by commercial and non-commercial entities in partnership with the university to research and develop ocean energy devices, such as floating wind turbines or wave energy converters.

In 1993, they defeated Lake Superior State University 5-4 behind a third period hat trick by Jim Montgomery. In 1999, they defeated rival [[University of New Hampshire Wildcats|University of New Hampshire]] 3-2 in overtime on a goal by Marcus Gustafsson.&lt;ref name=ESPNFrozenFour&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?page=almanacmenshockey|accessdate= 2009-05-11|title= Frozen Four History|publisher= [[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the football team competed in the Tangerine Bowl in Orlando, Florida against East Carolina. They were beaten in the game 31-0,&lt;ref name=CapOneBowl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=60968&amp;SPID=6637&amp;DB_OEM_ID=11300&amp;ATCLID=619680 |accessdate=2009-05-11 |title=Champs Sports Bowl History |publisher=Florida Citrus Sports }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; but remain the only team from Maine to compete in a bowl contest.

The baseball team has participated in seven [[College World Series]], six of them under coach [[John Winkin]] between 1976 and 1986, and one under Jack Butterfield in 1964. The Black Bears achieved two third-place finishes in 1964 and 1982.

Although the official [[fight song]] of UMaine is "For Maine", the school's main spirit song is the better-known "[[The Maine Stein Song|Maine Stein Song]]".  Written by Lincoln Colcord (words) and E. A. Fenstad (music), the tune rose to fame when singer [[Rudy Vallée]] arranged the current version.  Vallee attended Maine from 1921–1922 before transferring to [[Yale University|Yale]], and his popularity helped make the song a national favorite.  To this day, the "Stein Song" remains the only college fight song to ever reach number one on the pop charts, achieving this distinction in 1930.&lt;ref name=top40hits1930&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ntl.matrix.com.br/pfilho/html/top40/1930.html|accessdate= 2009-04-05|title= Top 40 Hits of 1930|publisher= LyricsWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to ''College Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology'', by Studwell and Schueneman, the "Stein Song" is one of the very best fight songs of all time.&lt;ref name=Studwell&gt;{{cite book|url= https://www.amazon.com/College-Fight-Songs-Annotated-Anthology/dp/0789006650#reader|accessdate= 2009-05-11|title= College Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology|first= William|last= Studwell|author2=Bruce R.

In addition to varsity athletics, the university offers many club sports through its Campus Recreation department.  Sport clubs represent UMaine by competing against teams and clubs from other universities and colleges. National governing bodies for each club provide competition guidelines and league structure.

Sport clubs are student-led and student-administered. Each has a budget that is run through Campus Recreation, which in part funds nearly all clubs. Clubs are eligible for funding through Campus Recreation after they have been active for at least one year and have a membership minimum of ten members. Current club sports include [[alpine skiing]], [[baseball]], [[Rowing (sport)|crew]], [[cricket]], [[cycling]], fast pitch [[softball]], [[field hockey]], [[golf]], [[ice hockey]], [[lacrosse]], [[nordic skiing]], [[roller hockey]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[shotokan karate]], [[soccer]], [[tennis]], [[table tennis]], tackle [[American football|football]], [[ultimate (sport)|ultimate]], and [[volleyball]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umaine.edu/campusrecreation/programs/clubs/clubs_about.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528124056/http://www.umaine.edu/campusrecreation/programs/clubs/clubs_about.html|date=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Directory is published as a collaboration of the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) and the [[Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research]] (FAIMER).

==Database==
For the database, a "medical school" is defined as an ''"educational institution that provides a complete or full program of instruction leading to basic medical qualification; that is, a qualification that permits the holder to obtain a license to practice as a medical doctor or physician''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wdoms.org/about/|title=About the World Directory |publisher=World Directory of Medical Schools |accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2016|12}} the database has records for 2,800 medical schools that are operational and more than 100 that have ceased to be operational.&lt;ref name=ECA&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecahe.eu/world-directory-medical-schools/|title=World Directory of Medical Schools – ECA |publisher=European Consortium for Accreditation |website=ecahe.eu|language=en|access-date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was  created by merging their respective [[Avicenna Directories|AVICENNA]] and [[IMED]] directories to produce a single comprehensive resource, including the schools in each of the prior directories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecfmg.org/news/2012/08/21/faimer-and-wfme-to-collaborate-on-combined-medical-school-directory/#sthash.W0VUVtPD.dpuf |title=FAIMER and WFME to Collaborate on Combined Medical School Directory |publisher= Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates |accessdate=2014-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The decision to merge the [[Avicenna Directories|AVICENNA]] and [[IMED]]  was finalized in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wdoms.org/history/ |title=History of the World Directory of Medical Schools |publisher= World Federation for Medical Education and the Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research |accessdate=2014-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The directory was  officially launched in April 2014. During the transition to the new   Directory, IMED and the Avicenna Directory remained open for a year, closing in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.faimer.org/announcements/wdoms-press-release-apr42014.pdf |title=FAIMER® and WFME Announce the Launch of the World Directory of Medical Schools |publisher=[[Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research]] |accessdate=2014-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sponsors==
The major sponsors are the [[Australian Medical Council]], [[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates]], [[Medical Council of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wdoms.org/sponsors/|title=World Directory of Medical Schools {{!}} Sponsors |publisher=World Directory of Medical Schools |website=www.wdoms.org|language=en |date=6 December 2016|access-date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
