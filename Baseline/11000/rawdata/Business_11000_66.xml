'''Arif Ali Durrani''' (born c. 1949 in [[Pakistan]]) is a Pakistani businessman who has twice been convicted by US courts of selling arms to Iran.

==Background==
Durrani was the son of a [[Pakistani Army]] officer with responsibility for military procurement. Durrani moved to the United States in 1973, settling in [[California]].&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 3 October 1998, [http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/03/local/me-28832 Inquiry Aims at Convicted Arms Dealer]&lt;/ref&gt; He gained an [[MBA]] from the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref name=AP&gt;[[Associated Press]], 12 December 1986, [http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1986/Documents-Reveal-Arms-Dealer-Lived-The-Good-Life/id-a66ce4f983f8c400f12d0419bf600d95 Documents Reveal Arms Dealer Lived The Good Life]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In February 1984 Durrani formed a company, Merex Corp, which traded in parts for military and commercial aircraft, and by his own account reached sales of $16m in 1986.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; He was arrested in October 1986 and subsequently convicted of trading [[Hawk missile]] parts to Iran, in what Durrani maintained were actions authorised by leading US government figures (specifically, [[Oliver North]]) as part of the [[Iran-Contra affair]] with the specific aim of his shipment leading to the freeing of US hostages held in Lebanon.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;''[[New York Times]]'', 4 December 1987, [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/04/world/court-rejects-appeal-of-pakistani-who-cited-north-in-arms-deals.html Court Rejects Appeal of Pakistani Who Cited North in Arms Deals]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]], 5 February 1987, [http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1987/Pakistani-Arms-Dealer-Claims-He-Worked-To-Free-Hostages/id-7cd65fec1890a412fb29580b265870a2 Pakistani Arms Dealer Claims He Worked To Free Hostages]&lt;/ref&gt; In denying Durrani bail, the judge described him as "enjoy[ing] an exorbitant lifestyle replete with material luxuries and one which causes him to travel the globe to meet with his business associates."&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; Durrani was sentenced to 10 years (and a $2m fine), and released after five years, in September 1992.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyn Bixby, ''[[Hartford Courant]]'', 28 October 1992, [http://articles.courant.com/1992-10-28/news/0000110653_1_foreigner-engine-parts-prison-term/3 Life In The Fast Lane, Then Slow Years In Jail]&lt;/ref&gt; Durrani said that many of his deals were financed via [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International]].&lt;ref&gt;''TIME'', 24 June 2001, [http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,157768,00.html Scandals: Not Just a Bank]&lt;/ref&gt; Durrani continued to protest his innocence after his release, arguing that he was working on transactions approved by the US and Israeli governments.&lt;ref&gt;Alan A. Block, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=ohRu0lKUz44C&amp;pg=PA2 The Origins of IRAN-CONTRA: Lessons from the Durrani Affair]", p2; in Frank Bovenkerk and Michael Levi (eds, 2007), ''The Organized Crime Community: Essays in Honor of Alan A. Block'', Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, 1992, Durrani testified to the [[United States House of Representatives]]' [[House October Surprise Task Force|October Surprise Task Force]] regarding public [[October Surprise conspiracy theory|statements he made that members of Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign met with Iranian officials to influence the outcome of the 1980 United States Presidential Election by delaying the release of American hostages]].&lt;ref name="October Surprise Task Force"&gt;{{cite book |author=Task Force to Investigate Certain Allegations Concerning the Holding of American Hostages by Iran in 1980 |author-link=House October Surprise Task Force |title=Joint report of the Task Force to Investigate Certain Allegations Concerning the Holding of American Hostages by Iran in 1980 ("October Surprise Task Force") |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015060776773 |date=January 3, 1993 |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |page=96, 136 |id=H. Rept. No. 102-1102 |oclc=27492534 |ref={{harvid|"October Surprise Task Force"|1993}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously told journalists [[Robert Parry (journalist)|Robert Parry]] and Robert Ross that the head of the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Iran's Revolutionary Guards]], [[Mohsen Rafighdoost|Mohsen Rafiqdust]], told him of a meeting between Iranian and United States officials in [[Madrid, Spain]].{{sfn|"October Surprise Task Force"|1993|pp=75}} In an on-camera interview for ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' aired in April 1991, Durrani elaborated stating that Rafiqdust, [[Mohsen Rezaee|Mohsen Reza'i]], and officials with the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]] told him a meeting between [[Mehdi Karroubi]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency]] [[Director of Central Intelligence|Director]] [[William Casey]] in Spain.{{sfn|"October Surprise Task Force"|1993|pp=75, 130}} According to [[Gary Sick]], Durrani had learned about the meeting from Rafiqdust, Reza'i, and Hamid Nagashian.{{sfn|"October Surprise Task Force"|1993|pp=130}} Durrani [[recantation|recanted]] these claims during his deposition to the Task Force.&lt;ref name="October Surprise Task Force"/&gt; He denied telling Robert Parry and Robert Ross that his contacts with the Revolutionary Guard told him about meetings between Iranian and US officials, said his on-air comments had been taken out of context or that he had misunderstood the reporter's question, and said that Sick's report was "incorrect".&lt;ref name="October Surprise Task Force"/&gt;

In 2006 Durrani was again convicted of selling arms to Iran,&lt;ref&gt;''[[U-T San Diego]]'', 18 March 2006, [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/military/20060318-9999-7m18arms.html Arms dealer guilty of illegally exporting military hardware]&lt;/ref&gt; and sentenced to more than 12 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]], [[military.com]], 18 July 2006, [http://www.military.com/NewsContent/0,13319,105903,00.html?ESRC=eb.nl Retired Officer Sentenced in Arms Deal]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Yıldırım was born in [[Ergani]]. He has 3 daughters, two of whom are from his first marriage.

==2011 Turkish sports corruption scandal==
{{Main|2011 Turkish sports corruption scandal}}
On 2 July 2012, a Turkish "Special Authority Court" sentenced Yıldırım to three years and nine months for match-fixing and two years and six months for forming an illegal organisation. The sentence was later approved by the Turkish Supreme Court of Appeals. He was detained for one year in [[Metris Prison]] together with several other sportspeople involved in the [[2011 Turkish sports corruption scandal|scandal]]. However, on 6 March 2014 special authority courts were abolished in Turkey. On 23 July 2014, his earlier retrial demand was accepted, meaning that he and all the people involved will have a retrial about this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/spor/futbol/20897860.asp |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |title=Aziz Yıldırım 365 gün sonra serbest kaldı |date=2012-07-02 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2014-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trthaber.com/haber/gundem/ozel-yetkili-mahkemeler-kaldirildi-120281.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/id/25522653/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.adahaberleri.com/spor/aziz-yildirim-sakarya-fenerbahce-spor-kulubu-dernegi-acilisina-katildi-h574.html |newspaper=[[AdaHaberleri]] |title=Aziz Yıldırım Sakarya'ya Geldi |date=2014-09-27 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2014-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141001230121/http://www.adahaberleri.com/spor/aziz-yildirim-sakarya-fenerbahce-spor-kulubu-dernegi-acilisina-katildi-h574.html |archivedate=1 October 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;The first trial of the retrial process was made on 24 April 2015.

[[File:MYAdisNoAD.jpg|thumb|1980 billboard hijacking by [[John Fekner]]]]
{{Anti-consumerism|Theories}}

'''Billboard hacking''' or '''billboard hijacking''' is the practice of altering a billboard without the consent of the owner. It may involve physically pasting new media over the existing image,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psfk.com/2012/07/british-billboards-hijacked-street-artists.html|title=Street Artists Hijack Billboards in UK [Pics]|last=Chen|first=Yi|date=19 July 2012|work=PSFK|access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or hacking into the system used to control electronic [[billboard]] displays. The aim is to replace the programmed video with a different video or image. The replaced media may be displayed for various reasons, including [[culture jamming]], shock value, promotion, activism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theurbancountry.com/2011/03/billboard-hijacking-to-promote-urban.html|title=Billboard Hijacking To Promote Urban Bicycling|last=Schwartz|first=James D.|date=7 March 2011|work=The Urban Country|type=Blog|access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; political propaganda,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news/city-billboards-hijacked-by-al|title=City billboards hijacked by AL|date=6 August 2013|work=The Daily Star|access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply to amuse viewers.

== Self-promotion ==
A Russian daredevil group called [[Ontheroofs]] hacked into a billboard atop a skyscraper in Hong Kong, causing it to display the name of their organization, a video of a previous climb up the then unfinished [[Shanghai Tower]], and the words "What's Up Hong Kong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/17/world/asia/on-the-roofs-climber/index.html|title=On the Roofs climbers scale new heights|last=McKirdy|first=Euan|date=18 October 2014|work=CNN|access-date=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two college students in [[Belgrade]], Serbia hacked into a billboard and then contacted the owner describing the vulnerability. The hack allowed them to play ''[[Space Invaders]]'' and then display "Hacked4Fun". The students were thanked by the owner for pointing out the vulnerability and each given an [[iPad Mini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/hackers-play-space-invaders-digital-billboard-owner-ipads/story?id=18736785|title=Hackers Play Space Invaders on Digital Billboard, Owner Gives Them iPads|last=Jovanovic|first=Dragana|date=15 March 2013|work=ABC News|access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2013/03/hackers-play-space-invaders-on-belgrade-billboard-get-rewarded-with-ipads/|title=Hackers play Space Invaders on Belgrade billboard, get rewarded with iPads|last=Farivar|first=Cyrus|date=14 March 2013|work=Ars Technica|access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Republic Square, Belgrade|Republic Square]], Belgrade, Serbia, hackers caused a billboard to display an advertisement for [[The Pirate Bay]] which read "First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/pirate-bay-ad-shown-on-hacked-billboard/#!|title=Pirate Bay 'ad' shown on hacked billboard|last=Healey|first=Nic|date=12 March 2013|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET|access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==
[[File:Billboard liberation front santa cruz.jpg|thumb|A billboard hijacked by the [[Billboard Liberation Front]]]]
A group named "Brandalism" has been hacking European billboards since 2012. Around November 2015, just prior to the Paris climate talks ([[COP21]]), street artists joined with this group and gained control of around 600 billboards around Paris making display the message "We'll keep on bribing politicians and emitting greenhouse gases" and a Volkswagen promotion reading "We're sorry that we got caught."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citylab.com/design/2015/11/cop21-paris-climate-billboard-artist-volkswagen-brandalism/417897/|title=Activist-Artists Hack 600 Paris Billboards With Climate Messages for COP21|last=Metcalfe|first=John|date=30 November 2015|work=CityLab|publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group|access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal response ==
Depending on the circumstances, billboard hacking may be illegal.  The [[FBI]] opened an investigation following the display of the obscene [[Goatse]] image on a billboard in [[Buckhead, Atlanta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/someone-hacked-a-billboard-in-atlanta-to-display-goatse|title=Someone Hacked a Billboard in Atlanta to Display Goatse|last=Koebler|first=Jason|date=15 May 2016|work=Motherboard|access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grahamcluley.com/2015/05/hackers-obscene-electronic-billboard/|title=Hackers plant obscene image on electronic billboard in Atlanta|last=Cluley|first=Graham|work=Graham Cluley|publisher=Cluley Associates|date=21 May 2015|access-date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another instance, one man was sentenced to 18 months in prison for displaying pornography on a Moscow billboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/5785446/a-man-is-going-to-prison-for-hacking-a-billboard-to-play-porn-nsfw|title=A Man Is Going to Prison for Hacking a Billboard to Play Porn (NSFW)|last=Chan|first=Casey|date=24 March 2016|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Gizmodo|access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
[[File:Its a bore.jpg|thumb|An example of hijacking using [[détournement]]]]
Control over the display of electronic billboards may be achieved by hacking. One possible way of doing this is by knowing the default password provided by the manufacturer as the customer may neglect to choose a new one.

With non-electronic billboards, the image may simply be pasted over with a new image, or, the original image modified using the technique of [[détournement]].

'''Carlo Hein Tabalujan''' (born '''Tan Tjin Hin''' 譚欣下巴;&lt;ref name="Setyautama50"&gt;{{Harvnb|Setyautama|1980|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; 18 April 1924—10 November 2011) is a [[Chinese Indonesian]] [[businessman]] and [[entrepreneur]] of [[Hokkien]] origin.&lt;ref name=Setyautama50 /&gt;  He is the head and founder of Indonesian [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] '''PT. Sumber Selatan Nusa'''.

== Early life ==
Born in [[Buitenzorg]] (today's [[Bogor]]) in 1924, Tan Tjin Hin, adopted the Indonesian family name of Tabalujan soon after Indonesia became independent on '''17 August 1945'''.&lt;ref name="Frey242"&gt;{{Harnvb|Frey-Tan Tai Yong|2003|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fourth son of an Indonesian Chinese trader in a small town near [[Bogor]]. The family moved to [[Manado]] in [[Sulawesi]] and prospered until the outbreak of the [[Pacific War]] in 1941&lt;ref name="Soebadio250"&gt;{{Harvnb|Soebadio-Noto Soebagio|1978|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in the complete loss of the family business.

Educated at the Anglo-Chinese College on the island of Kulangsu near [[Xiamen]], (Amoy) and at a business college in [[Jakarta]], Carlo Tabalujan at the age of seventeen was stranded entirely alone and without money when the Japanese occupied [[Java]]. He survived for three and a half years with the help from schoolmates and some poorly paid work. In 1945, his first real job was with the '''British Seaforth Highlanders''', part of the [[Allied Forces]]&lt;ref name=Tallboys120 /&gt;  that landed to take back control of Indonesia from the Japanese.

==Business==
In 1945, he began trading on his own by renting a desk in the office of a businessman. From that basic beginning, Carlo Tabalujan built up successful [[International trade|trading]] and [[manufacturing]] businesses. These include relationships with a number of international companies as his long-term partners, leading to  [[joint ventures]] controlling about a dozen affiliated companies under the Sumber Selatan umbrella, including  PT [[Nestlé]] Indonesia, PT Danapaints Indonesia, PT Century Batteries, PT Maskapai Ansuransi; Union-Far East and PT Dan Motor Indonesia [[Vespa]] which at the time became Indonesia's leading manufacturers and distributors of motorcycles, [[automotive]] and decorative parts.&lt;ref name= "Tallboys120"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tabalujan|Tallboys|1996|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Carlo Tabalujan strengthened the company's interest in the motorcycle industry by a joint venture with [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] motorcycles and heavy industries.

In 1972, The Australian Dairy Board monopoly expired. Ever since then, [[Nestlé]] Indonesia continued to diversify its consumer goods catering to local markets. Products such as [[Nescafé]] Coffee, Milkmaid and Dancow milk powder.

'''Fifty Years of Business In Indonesia'''

"''&lt;small&gt;This is the remarkable story of Carlo Tabalujan. Beginning in pre-war Indonesia, we learn how, as a seventeen year old schoolboy, he was stranded without family or money how he survived three and a half years of the Japanese occupation in Jakarta and how he then started out his business empire on his own; with nothing but a rented desk and a telephone"&lt;/small&gt;''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7974">The '''cement industry in the United States''' produced {{convert|82.8 |e6t}} of [[cement]] in 2015, worth US$9.8 billion, and was used to manufacture concrete worth about US$50 billion. The US was the world's third-largest producer of cement, after [[Cement industry in China|China]] and [[India]]. The US [[cement industry]] includes 99 [[cement mill]]s in 34 states, plus two plants in [[Puerto Rico]]. The industry directly employed 10,000 workers in 2015. Ten percent of the cement used in the United States in 2015 was imported.&lt;ref name="Summary"&gt;US Geological Survey, [http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/cement/ Cement], Mineral Commodity Summary, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The types and amounts of cement produced in 2015 were:
* [[Portland cement]]  80.4 million tons
* Masonry cement  2.4 million tons
* Other [[hydraulic cement]]  0.6 million tons

Cement production is predominantly [[portland cement]], which is mostly used in concrete. Cement for concrete is an essential material for construction, and demand is a function of construction spending. Single-family residential construction is considered only moderately cement-intensive; multifamily residential somewhat more intensive. Nonresidential construction and government construction projects are considered the most cement-intensive.

In 2013, 70.8 percent of portland cement was sold as [[ready-mix concrete]], such as is delivered in cement-mixer trucks. 11.5 percent was sold dry to contractors and construction materials stores; 11.3 percent was sold to manufacturers of concrete products; 4.6 percent was sold for oil and gas wells, and 1.8 percent was sold to government agencies and others.&lt;ref name="Yearbook"&gt;US Geological Survey, [http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/cement/myb1-2013-cemen.pdf Cement], Minerals Yearbook, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Because cement is a bulk commodity, transportation can be a significant part of the cost. To minimize transportation costs, cement plants are ideally located close to the market, with access to efficient transportation such as ship or railroad. Most cement plants are located close to the limestone deposits.

Thirty-four states have cement manufacturing plants. In 2013, the five leading cement-producing states, in descending order, were: [[Texas]], [[California]], [[Missouri]], [[Florida]], and [[Alabama]]. Together, the five accounted for almost half of US cement production. The list of top five cement-consuming states is similar: Texas, California, Florida, [[Ohio]] and [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="Yearbook"/&gt;

In 2015, about 10 percent of US cement consumption came from imports. The largest sources of US cement imports were [[Canada]] and [[Greece]].&lt;ref name="Summary"/&gt;

==Industry structure==
In 2013, the top producers of portland cement in the US were:&lt;ref name="Yearbook"/&gt;

* 1 - [[CEMEX]]
* 2 - [[Holcim]] (now [[LafargeHolcim]])
* 3 - Lehigh Hanson Inc.
* 4 - [[Buzzi Unicem]]
* 5 - [[Ash Grove Cement Company]] (to be acquired by [[CRH plc]] in early 2018)
* 6 - [[Lafarge North America]] (merged with Holcim in 2015)
* 7 - [[Texas Industries Inc]]
* 8 - Eagle Minerals Inc.
* 9 - Essroc Cement Corp.
* 10 - St. Marys Cement Group

In 2013, the top 5 companies produced 54 percent of US portland cement; the top 10 companies produced 78 percent.

==Inputs==
Portland cement is a complex mixture, mostly calcium, with admixtures of aluminium, silica, and iron. The choice of source materials depends on local availability. The calcium is usually supplied by limestone, but sometimes shell or coral. Slightly clayey limestones are preferable, because they already contain the necessary aluminium. Cement cannot contain more than 5 percent magnesium, so the limestone must be low in magnesium.

Energy sources used in the US to manufacture cement in 2013 were:
* Coal  6.0 million metric tons
* Petroleum coke  1.6 million metric tons
* Solid waste  1.1 million metric tons
* Used tires  0.4 million metric tons
* Oil  15.7 million liters
* Liquid waste  0.8 million liters
* Natural gas  694 million cubic meters
* Electricity  10.5 billion kilowatt-hours

==Environmental Effects==
The cement industry has both positive and negative effects on the environment.

===Source of waste and pollutants===
Cement manufacture is a source of the following airborne contaminants: particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www3.epa.gov/ttnchie1/ap42/ch11/final/c11s06.pdf Cement manufacture], US EPA, accessed 1 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cement production releases carbon dioxide by [[sintering]] limestone or shells. It is also very energy-intensive, with the result that the cement industry is a large emitter of carbon dioxide.

===Destruction of waste and pollutants===
The high temperatures of [[cement kiln]]s, the ability of concrete to incorporate different materials, and the stable and nonreactive nature of the concrete end product, all make cement kilns a desirable method for the destruction of hazardous waste. 

Hazardous wastes efficiently destroyed by cement kilns include chlorinated solvents ([[methylene chloride]], [[trichloroethylene]], [[trichloromethane]], [[trichloroethane]], [[carbon tetrachloride]]), [[Freon]]-113, [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs), [[dioxin]], waste oil, and used hydrocarbon solvents. Whatever undesirable materials are not destroyed are locked in the finished concrete, a stable material with low permeability. Hydrocarbon waste and used tires contribute to the kiln heat, and reduces fuel use. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www3.epa.gov/trimewebhelp/test/WebHelp.1282016/section_4_5_3_cement_kilns_burning_hazardous_waste_as_supplemental_fuel.htm "Cement kilns burning hazardous waste as supplemental fuel], US Environmental Protection Agency, accessed 2 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to destruction of hazardous waste, waste materials from other industries, such as slag and fly ash, are commonly incorporated into cement, eliminating the need to landfill the waste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://industrialresourcescouncil.org/Applications/PortlandCementManufacturing/tabid/384/Default.aspx Portland cement manufacturing], Industrial Resources Council, accessed 1 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of cement to incorporate different materials allows contaminated soil to be added to the feed, eliminating the need to take the material to a hazardous waste landfill. The US EPA estimated that in 2014, 13.1 million tons of coal fly ash, which otherwise would have to be landfilled, was beneficially used in cement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.epa.gov/coalash/coal-ash-reuse&lt; Coal as reuse], US EPA, 24 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the use of fly ash improves the strength and durability of concrete&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/recycling/fach03.cfm Fly ash concrete for highways], US Dept. of Transportation, accessed 13 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Columbus Tubi''' is a manufacturer of steel tubing used in [[bicycle frame]]s, located in [[Settala]], in the [[Province of Milan]]. The company was founded in 1919 by A.L. Colombo and was taken over by Colombo's youngest son, Antonio, in 1977. It is now a division of Gruppo SPA, which also owns the bicycle manufacturer [[Cinelli]].

Columbus tubing was the main competitor to [[Reynolds Technology|TI Reynolds 531]] in the bicycle tube set market with many of the big name Italian manufacturers of bicycles and framesets utilising their products. Famous name builders such as [[Bianchi Bicycles|Bianchi]], [[Centurion (bicycle)|Centurion Bicycles]] (after 1981), [[De Rosa (bicycles)|De Rosa]], [[Ciocc]], [[Pinarello]] and [[Colnago]] all specified the Columbus tubesets as part of their range.

A '''company''', abbreviated as '''co.''', is a [[Legal personality|legal entity]] made up of an [[Voluntary association|association]] of people, be they [[Natural person|natural]], [[Legal personality|legal]], or a mixture of both, for carrying on a [[Commerce|commercial]] or [[industry | industrial]] [[wiktionary:enterprise| enterprise]]. Company members share a common purpose, and unite to focus their various [[desire|talents]] and organize their collectively available [[skill]]s or [[resource]]s to achieve specific, declared [[goal]]s. Companies take various forms, such as:

* [[voluntary association]]s, which may include [[nonprofit organization]]s
* [[Companies law|business entities]] with an aim of gaining a [[Profit (economics)|profit]]
* [[Financial capital|financial entities]] and [[bank]]s

A company or association of persons can be created at [[law]] as a legal person so that the company in itself can accept [[limited liability]] for civil responsibility and taxation incurred as members perform (or fail to discharge) their [[duty]] within the [[Common knowledge|publicly declared]] ''[[Incorporation (business)|"birth certificate"]]'' or [[Publishing|published]] [[policy]].

Companies as legal persons may associate and register themselves collectively as other companies – often known as a [[corporate group]]. When a company closes, it may need a ''[[Liquidation|"death certificate"]]'' to avoid further legal obligations.

==Meanings and definitions==
A company can be defined as an "artificial person", invisible, intangible, created by or under law, with a discrete [[legal personality]], [[perpetual succession]], and a [[Company seal|common seal]].{{cn|date=October 2013}} It is not affected by the death, insanity, or [[insolvency]] of an individual member.

===Etymology===
The English word ''company'' has its origins in the [[Old French]] military term ''compagnie'' (first recorded in 1150), meaning a "body of soldiers",&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|company}}&lt;/ref&gt; which came from the [[Late Latin]] word ''companio'' ("one who eats bread with you"), first attested in the ''[[Salic law|Lex Salica]]'' as a calque of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] expression ''gahlaibo'' (literally, "with bread"), relGerman]] ''galeipo'' ("companion") and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''gahlaiba'' ("messmate"). By 1303, the word referred to [[Guild|trade guild]]s. Usage of the term ''company'' to mean "business association" was first recorded in 1553,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and the abbreviation "co." dates from 1769.

===United Kingdom===
In [[English law]] and in legal jurisdictions based upon it, a company is a [[Legal personality|body corporate]] or corporation company registered under the [[United Kingdom company law|Companies Acts]] or similar legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/1 Companies Act 2006, Section 1]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Common forms include:
* [[Private company limited by guarantee|Private companies limited by guarantee]]
* Companies without share capital (often [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] entities)
* [[Private company limited by shares|Private companies limited by shares]] - the most common form of company
* [[Public limited company|Public limited companies]] - companies, usually large, which are permitted to (but do not have to) offer their shares to the public, for example on a [[stock exchange]]

In the United Kingdom, a [[partnership]] is not legally a company, but may sometimes be referred to{{by whom?|date=October 2015}} informally as a company. It may be referred to as a [[Business|firm]].

===United States===
In the [[United States]], a company may be a "[[corporation]], [[partnership]], association, [[joint-stock company]], [[Investment trust|trust]], [[Mutual fund|fund]], or organized group of [[person]]s, whether incorporated or not, and (in an official capacity) any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, or similar official, or liquidating [[Law of agency|agent]], for any of the foregoing".&lt;ref name="Black's"&gt;Black's Law and lee Dictionary. Second Pocket Edition. Bryan A. Garner, editor. West. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the US, a company is not necessarily a corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/company|title=Company legal definition of company|work=TheFreeDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
{{for|a country-by-country listing|types of business entity}}

See also [[Business#Forms|types of business]]

*'''A [[Private company limited by guarantee|company limited by guarantee]]'''.  Commonly used where companies are formed for non-commercial purposes, such as clubs or charities.  The members guarantee the payment of certain (usually nominal) amounts if the company goes into [[liquidation|insolvent liquidation]], but otherwise they have no economic rights in relation to the company. This type of company is common in [[England]]. A company limited by guarantee may be with or without having [[share capital]].
*'''A [[Private company limited by shares|company limited by shares]]'''.  The most common form of company used for business ventures. Specifically, a limited company is a "company in which the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount individually invested" with corporations being "the most common example of a limited company."&lt;ref name="Black's"/&gt; This type of company is common in [[England]] and many English-speaking countries. A company limited by shares may be a
**[[public company|publicly traded company]] or a
**[[privately held company]].
*'''A company limited by guarantee with a share capital'''.  A hybrid entity, usually used where the company is formed for non-commercial purposes, but the activities of the company are partly funded by investors who expect a return.  This type of company may no longer be formed in the UK, although provisions still exist in law for them to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Companies Act 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''A [[limited liability company]]'''. "A company—statutorily authorized in certain states—that is characterized by limited liability, management by members or managers, and limitations on ownership transfer", i.e., L.L.C.&lt;ref name="Black's"/&gt; LLC structure has been called "hybrid" in that it "combines the characteristics of a corporation and of a partnership or sole proprietorship". Like a corporation, it has limited liability for members of the company, and like a partnership it has "flow-through taxation to the members" and must be "dissolved upon the death or bankruptcy of a member".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/llc.asp#ixzz2CEzgE239|title=Limited Liability Company (LLC) Definition - Investopedia|author=root|work=Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''An [[unlimited company]] with or without a share capital'''. A hybrid entity, a company where the liability of members or shareholders for the debts (if any) of the company are not limited. In this case doctrine of veil of incorporation does not apply.

''Less common types of companies are:''
*'''Companies formed by letters patent'''.  Most corporations by letters patent are ''[[corporation sole|corporations sole]]'' and not companies as the term is commonly understood today.
*'''[[Royal charter|Charter corporations]]'''.  Before the passing of modern companies legislation, these were the only types of companies.{{dubious|date=July 2018}}&lt;!-- even in the ancient Roman Republic? see [[Corporation#History]] --&gt;  Now they are relatively rare, except for very old companies that still survive (of which there are still many, particularly many British banks), or modern societies that fulfill a quasi regulatory function (for example, the [[Bank of England]] is a corporation formed by a modern charter).
*'''Statutory companies'''.  Relatively rare today, certain companies have been formed by a private statute passed in the relevant jurisdiction.

Note that "Ltd" after the company's name signifies a limited company, and "PLC" ([[public limited company]]) indicates that its shares are widely held.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/guides/z4br87h/revision/3|title=BBC Bitesize - GCSE Business - Forms of business ownership - Revision 3|website=BBC Bitesize|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In legal parlance, the owners of a company are normally referred to as the "members". In a company limited or unlimited by shares (formed or incorporated with a share capital), this will be the [[shareholder]]s. In a company limited by guarantee, this will be the guarantors. Some [[Offshore financial centre|offshore jurisdictions]] have created special forms of [[offshore company]] in a bid to attract business for their jurisdictions. Examples include "[[segregated portfolio company|segregated portfolio companies]]" and restricted purpose companies.

There are, however, many, many sub-categories of types of company that can be formed in various jurisdictions in the world.

Companies are also sometimes distinguished for legal and regulatory purposes between '''[[public limited company|public companies]]''' and '''[[privately held company|private companies]]'''. Public companies are companies whose shares can be publicly traded, often (although not always) on a [[stock exchange]] which imposes [[Listing (finance)|listing requirements]]/[[Listing Rules]] as to the issued shares, the trading of shares and future issue of shares to help bolster the reputation of the exchange or particular market of an exchange. Private companies do not have publicly traded shares, and often contain restrictions on transfers of shares. In some jurisdictions, private companies have maximum numbers of shareholders.

A [[parent company]] is a company that owns enough voting stock in another firm to control management and operations by influencing or electing its board of directors; the second company being deemed as a subsidiary of the parent company.

'''Downtown Harrisburg''', is the central core business and government center which surrounds the focal point of [[Market Square, Harrisburg|Market Square]], and serves as the regional center for the greater [[Harrisburg metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], United States.

Harrisburg's downtown Center City comprises the original {{convert|80|acre|m2|sing=on}} borough laid out in a grid pattern by [[John Harris, Sr.|John Harris]] in 1785. East-west streets are named and north-south streets are numbered. Market Street, running east-west, is the dividing point between north and south street designations. Sightseeing is probably best done on foot downtown and by car elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Northeast/Harrisburg-Transportation.html city-data.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrisburg's [[Central Business District]] includes the [[Pennsylvania State Capitol Complex]] and other state government offices, the [[Dauphin County Courthouse]] and other county government offices, City of Harrisburg offices, and other, non-government related commercial retail and office development. Some residential development, both in apartment high-rises and in the upper floors of mixed commercial/residential use buildings, is also located in the downtown area.

Downtown is bordered in the northwest by the mixed commercial/residential use [[Capitol District (Harrisburg)|Capitol District]], in the west by the [[Susquehanna River]], in the southwest by the largely residential [[Shipoke(Harrisburg)|Shipoke]] neighborhood, in the south by [[Interstate 83]], in the east by [[Amtrak]] and [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] lines, and in the north by [[Midtown (Harrisburg)|Midtown Harrisburg]], a mixed-use commercial and residential neighborhood. Forster Street is usually considered the boundary between Downtown and Midtown Harrisburg. [[City Island (Pennsylvania)|City Island]], located in the middle of the Susquehanna River directly west of downtown, is typically considered part of Downtown Harrisburg.

==Demographics==
As of the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]&lt;ref name="GR2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factfinder2.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=American FactFinder |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911234518/http://factfinder2.census.gov/ |archivedate=2013-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; there were 1,999 people living in downtown. The racial makeup was 64.4% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 27.9% [[Race (United States Census)|African-American]], 2.2% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]] and 4.5% were [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race. The largest age group is those aged 25–34 at 19.1% of the population.

==Education and Culture==
Harrisburg's downtown has become a vibrant scene of restaurants, nightclubs, shops and museums over the past several years.

Most notably, the [[Harrisburg University of Science and Technology]], founded in 2001, is located at the corner of Market and 4th streets. [[Temple University]] and [[Messiah College]] both have campuses downtown.

==="SoMa" (South of Market) District===
In 2007, the Harristown Development Corporation, a private authority formed to redevelop downtown Harrisburg, designated downtown Harrisburg bounded by Market to the north, 3rd to the west, Chestnut to the south, and 4th to the east as Harrisburg's "SoMa" or South of Market district. Harrisburg plans to add brick-accented walkways and SoMa banners on the light poles to indicate the district's location. The development corporation is trying to foster a desirable location for international business and arts.

*The [[Susquehanna art museum]] is located at the corner of 3rd and Market and features local and traveling national and international art exhibitions.
*The [[Whitaker Center for Science and the Arts]] on Market street hosts an [[IMAX]] theater, children's science museum with traveling exhibits, a gift shop and [[Starbucks]] coffee.
*[[Capital Area School for the Arts]] has a location on south 3rd street.
*Messiah College's [https://web.archive.org/web/20071012120144/http://www.messiah.edu/schools/edu_soc_sci/institute/ Harrisburg Institute]

SoMa also includes several restaurants, bars and two nightclubs, an African-American bookstore, record store, and other shops.

==Retail==
A small [[shopping mall]], [[Strawberry Square]], is the most notable commercial development in the downtown area. The Shops On Third is a collection of several upscale retail offerings along 3rd street just north of Market.

Most of downtown's service retail is located along the Market and 2nd street corridors.

===Restaurant Row===
2nd street from Market to Forster is sometimes referred to as [http://www.harrisburghello.com/dine/ Restaurant Row] for its collection of eateries. Most of Harrisburg's nightlife also takes place on 2nd street, where several bars and dance clubs call home.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1194">'''Drum drying''' is a method used for drying out liquids from raw materials with [[drying drum]]. In the drum-drying process, pureed raw ingredients are dried at relatively low temperatures over rotating, high-capacity drums that produce sheets of drum-dried product. This product is milled to a finished flake or powder form. Modern drum drying techniques results in dried ingredients which reconstitute immediately and retain much of their original flavor, color and nutritional value.

Some advantages of drum drying include the ability of drum dryers to dry viscous foods which cannot be easily dried with other methods. Drum dryers can be clean and hygienic and easy to operate and maintain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Agriculture, Food, and Biological Engineering|publisher=Marcel Dekker, Inc.|isbn=0-8247-0938-1|pages=211–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other products where drum drying can be used are, for example, [[starch]]es, [[breakfast cereals]], [[baby food]], [[instant mashed potatoes]] to make them cold-water-soluble.

==Origin of the Scheme==
The question of providing for the future of industrial workers after their retirement or for their dependents, in the event of their premature death, engaged the attention of the Central Government for a long time. The first Provident Fund Act passed in 1925 for regulating the provident funds of some private concerns was limited in scope.  In 1929 the Royal Commission on Labour stressed the need for formulating schemes for instituting provident funds for industrial workers. In the Indian Labour Conference held in 1948, it was generally agreed that the introduction of a statutory provident fund scheme for industrial workers might be undertaken. To test such a scheme in a  restricted field the  Coal Mines Provident Fund Scheme was launched in 1948. The success of this Scheme led to the demand for its expansion to other industries.

Accordingly, close of the year 1951 witnessed the promulgation of the Employees' Provident Funds Ordinance.  The Ordinance promulgated on 15 November 1951 was replaced by the Employees' Provident Funds Act, 1952 which extended to the whole of India except Jammu and Kashmir. The  Employees' Provident Funds Scheme, 1952 framed under section 5 of the Act was brought into force by stages and was enforced in  its entirety by 1 November 1952.

==Provident Fund==
The Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 came into effect on 4 March 1952. Six industries namely Cigarettes, Electrical, mechanical or general engineering products, Iron and Steel, Paper and Textiles (made wholly or in part of cotton, wool or jute or silk, whether natural or artificial) came under implementation of the Act wef 1 November 1952 The organisation is administered by a Central Board of Trustees, composed of representatives of the Government of India, State governments, Employers and Employees. The board is chaired by the Union Labour Minister of India. The Chief Executive of the EPFO, the Central Provident Fund Commissioner, reports to the Union Labour Minister through the Secretary of Labour and Employment in the ministry. The headquarters of the organisation is in [[New Delhi]].

The [[Constitution of India]] under "Directive Principles of State Policy" provides that the State shall within the limits of its economic capacity make effective provision for securing the right to work, to education and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old-age, sickness &amp; disablement and undeserved want. The EPF &amp; MP Act, 1952 was enacted by the [[Parliament of India]] and came into force with effect from 4 March 1952 as part of a series of legislative interventions  made in this direction. Presently, the following three schemes are in operation under the Act:
#  Employees' Provident Fund Scheme, 1952
#  Employees' Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme, 1976
#  Employees' Pension Scheme, 1995 (replacing the Employees' Family Pension Scheme, 1971)

Retirement fund body EPFO on 21 February 2018 lowered the rate of interest on employees provident fund to 8.55% for 2017-18,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nayaindia.com/business-news/epfo-declares-8-55-pc-interest-rate-for-2017-18.html|title=EPFO Declares 8.55% interest Rate for 2017-18|date=21 February 2018|work=Naya India}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 8.65%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/epfo-cuts-interest-rate-to-8-55-for-2017-18-from-8-65-for-2016-17/articleshow/63016770.cms|title=EPFO cuts interest rate to 8.55% for 2017-18 from 8.65% for 2016-17|date=22 February 2018|work=The Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the previous fiscal.

The EPFO has the dual role of being the enforcement agency to oversee the implementation of the [http://biblehr.com/the-employees-provident-fund-and-miscellaneous-provisions-act-1952-epf-act/ EPF &amp; MP Act] and as a service provider for the covered beneficiaries throughout the country.

The Act is administered by Central Board of Trustees, EPF a Statutory Board constituted by the Central Government under Section 5A of the Act. The CBT, as the Board is informally called, consists of a Chairman, a Vice Chairman, 5 Central Government Representatives, 15 State Government Representatives, 10 Employees' Representatives, 10 Employers' Representatives with Central P.F Commissioner and the Member Secretary to the Board. The Executive Committee of the CBT is constituted from among the members of the CBT to assist the Central Board in discharge of its function related to Administrative matters.

The officials of the organization in the Cadre of Commissioners are appointed by the Central Board under Section 5D for efficient administration of the Act and Schemes. To this end, the Commissioners of the Organization are vested with vast powers under the statute conferring quasi-judicial authority for assessment of financial liability on the employer, search and seizure of records, levy of damages, attachment and auction of a defaulter's property, prosecution and arrest and detention of defaulters in civil prison etc.

Administratively, the organization is divided into zones which are headed by an Additional Central Provident Fund Commissioner. At present, there are 10 Zones across the country. Further below, the states have either one or more than one Regional Offices headed by Regional Provident Fund Commissioners (RPFC) (Grade I) which are again sub- divided into Sub-Regions headed by Regional Provident Fund Commissioners (Grade II). To assist them are Assistant Provident Fund Commissioners looking after the enforcement of the Act and Schemes. Many districts in the country have district offices where an assistant provident fund commissioner is stationed for implementation of the scheme and attend to grievances.

The total manpower of the EPFO is at present more than 20000 including all levels. The Commissioner cadre numbering 815 are recruited directly, competitively, through the Union Public Service Commission of India as well as through promotion from lower ranks. Subordinate Officers (Enforcement Officers/Accounts Officers) are also recruited directly in addition to promotion from the staff cadre of social security assistants.

==Universal Account Number==
'''UAN is Universal Account Number'''. The [http://uanlogin.in UAN] is a 12-digit  number allotted to employee who is contributing to EPF will be generated for each of the PF member by EPFO. For example, 111222333444. The UAN will act as an umbrella for the multiple Member Ids allotted to an individual by different establishments and also remains same through the lifetime of an employee. It does not change with the change in jobs. The idea is to link multiple Member Identification Numbers (Member Id) allotted to a single member under single Universal Account Number. This will help the member to view details of all the Member Identification Numbers (Member Id) linked to it.

The Major benefit of UAN or Universal Account Number will include easy tagging of multiple Employee's Provident Fund Member Id under a single number, thus reducing the confusion. The UAN will help in easy transfer and withdrawals of claims. Along with this services like Online Pass-Book, [[Short Message Service|SMS]] Services on each deposit of contribution and Online [[Know your customer|KYC]] Update can be provided on the basis of UAN number. Before that, you need to activate UAN &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pavzipost.com/uan-login-activation-epf-balance-statement-passbook-download/|title=UAN Login &amp; Activation EPF Balance Statement Passbook Download - Complete Guide about epfindia|author=|date=1 October 2018|website=pavzipost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; from EPFO portal.

==Longevity Risk==
In March 2018, Union Cabinet claimed that almost 84 million EPFO subscribers did not have birth dates and that father's name was missing in 110 million accounts.

Critics asserted that such excuses were turning common to cancel pension and other annuity schemes without any legal backlash, riot or even public debate. The underlying cause is believed to be unfunded or underfunded risk through longevity swap transactions.

'''The Four-Phase Model''' is a [[Scientific_modelling|model]] for [[Project manager|manager]]s and management consultants developed by Prof. Teun W. Hardjono to analyze present organization and to determine what [[organization]]al control points and interventions must be in relation to their strategy. It also points out what the most likely strategy for an organization is from the point of view of the present organization, as well as what the possible discrepancy is between the most likely strategy from a market view and from an organizational view. The model gives guidelines for a program of organizational change, in order to remove the discrepancy. In this way, the model can be used to show how organizations can learn with respect to the [[strategy|strategical]] choices. The model is now being used by several consultancy firms and by researchers as the [[theory|theoretical]] background for theses. This led to several case studies in which the use of the model is illustrated. In the original book ‘Ritmiek en organisatiedynamiek’, several cases are described. This article describes the Four-Phase Model and the ideas and assumptions behind it.

The model has been the outcome of a [[PhD]] survey, and was presented for the first time in 1995.  Since then it was used in many [[research project]]s, for training and [[education]]al purposes, in consultancy assignments, and for the European Corporate Sustainability Framework (ECSF) and has been developed on request of the [[European Commission]]. It is made in co-operation with several [[university|universities]] and consultancy agencies, and is meant to be the basis for tools to be developed which help organizations to implement [[sustainability]] and [[corporate social responsibility]].

The PhD survey, of which the Four-Phase Model is the outcome, reflected almost 20 years of study by a [[management consultant]] on [[corporate strategy]] and organizational change. The basic assumption of the model is that many [[management]] principles, models and even hypes have their value, but only in a certain context. This context depends on the market circumstances, the strategy of the organization, the history of the organization, and the organizational culture. The whole model has been made plausible by studying organizations like Philips or [[KLM]] and many others.

'''Frederik Hendrik''', or '''Frits Fentener van Vlissingen''' ([[Amsterdam]], 20 July 1882 &amp;ndash; [[Vught]], 30 July 1962) was a Dutch businessman and entrepreneur credited with growing [[SHV Holdings|SHV]] into the first Dutch [[multinational corporation]]. He is the grandfather of [[Frits Fentener van Vlissingen]], [[John Fentener van Vlissingen]] and [[Paul Fentener van Vlissingen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsevier.nl/web/Artikel/173038/Familieportret-Hoe-de-Fentener-van-Vlissingens-fortuin-vergaarden.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Vereenigde Steenkolen Handel Ymuiden - Lloyds Register of Shipping 1912-1913.jpg|thumb|left|One of a series of old Lloyd's registers from former N.V. Vereenigde Steenkolenhandel offices in [[IJmuiden]]. Currently in the library of the [[Zee- en Haven Museum]] there. The SHV managed the transport of coal ("Steenkool") in the [[North Sea Canal]].]] 
He was married to Sophie Schout Velthuys (1882–1976), who came from a wealthy banking family (Bank Vlaer &amp; Kol). Her twin sister Mies (1882–1925) married Fentener van Vlissingen's SHV colleague and later rival Daniel George van Beuningen. In 1904 — at age 22 — Frits began working for his father in the family company, ''Steenkolen Handels Vereeniging'' (SHV).&lt;ref name=inghist&gt;[http://www.inghist.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn5/fentener/ F.H. van Vlissingen] in inghist&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the company was the sole agent for the coal from [[Rheinisch-Westfälisches Kohlen-Syndikat]]. In 1906 he managed to win exclusive rights to the waterways of the Netherlands for the transport of coal, creating two daughter companies for this;&lt;ref name=inghist/&gt; N.V. Steenkolen Handels Vereeniging in [[Rotterdam]], and N.V. Vereenigde Steenkolenhandel in [[IJmuiden]]. Under his leadership, the ties with Germany remained close for the company through two world wars.&lt;ref name=inghist/&gt; Monique Josephine Fentener van Vlissingen (1953-), daughter to Frits the second (1933-2006) and Mia Spaan (1919-), and only granddaughter to Frits the first, married wealthy Dutch industrialist Johan Haarmans (1956-).&lt;ref name="inghist"/&gt; Johan was responsible for maintaining and growing [[SHV Holdings]] in emerging markets (primarily Asia-Pacific). Their second son Martin Haarmans (1990-) is noted as being the first SHV heir to leave the family business to work as a London-based investment banker.&lt;ref name=dynasties&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/dynasties/ in dynasties]&lt;/ref&gt;

Frits moved the company headquarters from Rotterdam to Utrecht, across from the [[Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen]], his largest customer.&lt;ref name=inghist/&gt; During [[World War I]] he negotiated on behalf of the Ministry of Economic affairs in the Netherlands for trade in coal and iron with Germany.&lt;ref name=inghist/&gt; On 7 October 1919, the ''Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij voor Nederland en Koloniën'' (Royal Flying Company for the Netherland and her Colonies) — which would become simply [[KLM]] — was founded. Fentener van Vlissingen collected money from eight others and with his own capital he financed the company with 1.2 million guilders to allow it to start up. From that point onwards he became a board member in many large Dutch companies. Though known as an art lover and music fan who donated countless amounts to various cultural establishments, most of his efforts were for his business. He became interested in the manufacture of [[rayon]] when he discovered that it needed large amounts of coal to produce. He made a deal with the German producer [[Vereinigte Glanzstoff Fabriken]] that later led to the founding in 1929 of the ''[[Algemene Kunstzijde Unie]]'' (AKU),&lt;ref name=inghist/&gt; which was merged in 1969 to found AKZO, the predecessor to [[AkzoNobel]]. In 1938 he was a member of the board for over 40 organizations, including [[Hoogovens]].&lt;ref name=inghist/&gt;

He expanded the interests of the SHV (Coal, Oil, Gas and Scrap Metal) into the making of paints and coatings.

In 1945 he gave up his director's position at SHV in favour of his son Jan, and in 1951 he moved with his wife to the estate "Beukenhorst" in Vught.&lt;ref name=inghist/&gt; His former home in Utrecht was given to the city and it became part of the [[Centraal Museum]].&lt;ref name=inghist/&gt;

'''''Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In''''' is a best-selling 1981 non-fiction book by [[Roger Fisher (academic)|Roger Fisher]] and [[William Ury|William L. Ury]]. Subsequent editions in 1991 and 2011 added Bruce Patton as co-author. All of the authors were members of the [[Harvard Negotiation Project]]. The book made appearances for years on the ''[[Business Week]]'' [[bestseller]] list. The book suggests a method called '''principled negotiation''' or "[[negotiation]] of merits".

==Background==
Members of the [[Harvard Negotiation Project]], Fisher and Ury focused on the psychology of negotiation in their method, "principled negotiation", finding acceptable solutions by determining which needs are fixed and which are flexible for negotiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Dance of Negotiation | last = Morrow | first = Lance | date = Dec 7, 1981 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953270-1,00.html | journal = Time | accessdate = 2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1987, the book had been adopted in several U.S. school districts to help students understand "non-adversarial bargaining".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Alternatives To adversarial negotiations being used successfully | work = Eugene Register-Guard | date = May 12, 1987 | last = Piele | first = Philip K. |author2=Stuart C.

The book became a perennial best-seller. By July 1998, it had been appearing for more than three years on the ''Business Week'' "Best-Seller" book list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Business Week Best-Seller List |work=Business Week |date=July 6, 1998 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/1998/27/b3585036.htm |accessdate=2009-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215040748/http://www.businessweek.com/1998/27/b3585036.htm |archivedate=2009-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2007, it was still making appearances on the list as one of the "Longest Running Best Sellers" in paperback business books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_49/b4061103.htm |title=The Business Week Best Seller List |work=Business Week |date=December 3, 2007 |accessdate=2009-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003024129/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_49/b4061103.htm |archivedate=October 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The third edition was published in 2011.&lt;ref name="3rd ed"/&gt;

==Method of principled negotiation==
{{Page numbers needed|section|date=May 2017}}
The method of principled negotiation was developed at the Harvard [[Program on Negotiation]] by Fisher, Ury, and Patton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = About the Harvard Negotiation Project | work = Program on Negotiation Harvard Law School | date = April 19, 2009 | url = http://www.pon.harvard.edu/research_projects/harvard-negotiation-project/hnp/ | accessdate = January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to reach agreement without jeopardizing business relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = The Harvard Principled Negotiation | work = The World of Collaborative Practice | last = Gladel | first = Florence | date = July 1, 2012 | url = http://theworldofcollaborativepractice.com/?p=1305 | accessdate = January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method is based on five propositions:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fisher |first1=Roger |last2=Ury |first2=William |last3=Patton |first3=Bruce |date=1991 |origyear=1981 |title=Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=9780140157352 |oclc=24318769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Separate the people from the problem" ===
The first principle of ''Getting to Yes''—"Separate the people from the problem"—applies to the interaction between the two parties to a negotiation. The principle is broken down into three subcategories: perception, emotion, and communication. The authors point out that negotiators are people first—people who have values, cultural backgrounds, and emotions that vary by person.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Getting to Yes'' teaches that this human aspect can be either helpful or disastrous. Negotiation can either build trust and understanding with a positive relationship established at the end, or lead to frustration or dissatisfaction. The authors discuss how the relationship between parties tends to become entangled with the problem that the parties are discussing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Incorrectly deducing the intentions of the other party based on one's own fear is a common mistake; the authors describe it as a bad habit that could cost "fresh ideas in the direction of agreement".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The authors explain that feelings are just as important as the content of the dispute during negotiation. Communication is the main aspect of negotiating, and the authors point out three common problems in communication:
# Not clearly speaking with the other party, but instead attempting to impress those within one's constituency by taking a side instead of working toward a mutual agreement;
# Not actively listening to the other party, but instead only listening to rebut the other party's statements;
# Misunderstanding or misinterpreting what the other party has said.

Similarly, in the book, ''I Win You Win'', Carl Lyons explored the principle of "separating the person from the problem" and discovered that interests are an extension of values. People's current interests are always attempting to satisfy something that they value. Understanding this principle is a key first step in understanding people's behavior in negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=I win, you win: the essential guide to principled negotiation|last=Lyons|first=Carl|publisher=London : A &amp; C Black|year=2007|isbn=|location=9781408101902|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Focus on interests, not positions" ===
The second principle—"Focus on interests, not positions"—is about the position that the parties hold and the interests that led them to that position. The authors recommend that negotiators should focus on the interests behind the position that each party holds. Both parties should discuss their interests and keep an open mind to the other side of the argument.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is crucial to put yourself in the shoes of the other side to try to understand "why" the other side is acting the way they are or rather "why they are not".&lt;ref name="3rd ed"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fisher |first1=Roger |last2=Ury |first2=William |last3=Patton |first3=Bruce |date=2011 |origyear=1981 |title=Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=9780143118756 |oclc=609540048}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}} The authors state that "the most powerful interests are basic human needs".&lt;ref name="3rd ed"/&gt;{{rp|50}}

=== "Invent options for mutual gain" ===
The third principle—"Invent options for mutual gain"—is about benefiting both parties that are doing business. This principle aims to help the parties find an option that will impact each party in a positive way, making both sides feel like they did not get taken advantage of during the negotiation. It is important to listen to the other party and not make a decision until both parties feel that they have been heard. Both parties should clearly explain their intentions and what they want out of the conversation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== "Insist on using objective criteria" ===
The fourth principle—"Insist on using objective criteria"—is about making sure that the conversation stays on topic and that it is productive. The parties are making deals based on objective and practical criteria. The three steps to using objective criteria are to find out what the other party's intentions are, keep an open mind, and never give in to pressure or threats.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Each party is in charge of keeping the other party committed to the conversation.

=== "Know your BATNA" ===
The fifth principle—"Know your [[Best alternative to a negotiated agreement|BATNA]] (Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement)"—emphasizes that no method can guarantee success if all the leverage lies on the other side.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The authors suggest two methods of going about negotiating from a position of power. First, each party should protect themselves first. Second, each party should make the most of the power within their own assets to negotiate and win against the opposite party.

When negotiating, the parties must resist the urge to constantly compromise for fear of completely losing the negotiation. Such compromises may allow for a shorter negotiation, but may also leave the primary party with a deal that didn't benefit them to the full extent. Establishing a "bottom line" can protect the negotiator's final offer, but may limit the ability to learn from the negotiation itself and may preclude further negotiation that possibly could result in a better advantage for all parties involved. When considering final decisions, each party may want to take a step back and consider all possible alternatives to the current offer being made. One example in the book describes a house on the market: Thinking of all other possibilities if the house were not sold should be compared with the option of selling the house to ensure the best decision is made.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Principled negotiation in action==
The article "Taking steps toward 'Getting to Yes' at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida" highlights principled negotiation in practice by a major insurance company.&lt;ref name="BCBS"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Booth |first1=Bridget |last2=McCredie |first2=Matt |date=August 2004 |title=Taking steps toward "Getting to Yes" at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida |journal=The Academy of Management Executive |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=109–112 |doi=10.5465/AME.2004.14776178 |url=http://amp.aom.org/content/18/3/109 |publisher=[[Academy of Management]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blue Cross and Blue Shield]]—aware of increasing competition, rising healthcare prices, and increased customer expectations—sought to highlight other parties' interests when creating policies so as not to drive away business.&lt;ref name="BCBS"/&gt; The authors noted that applying principled negotiation techniques came much more naturally at the executive level and needed more practice at lower levels of management.&lt;ref name="BCBS"/&gt;

==Criticism==
[[James J. White]], a professor of law at the [[University of Michigan]], suggested that ''Getting to Yes'' is not scholarly or analytical and relies on anecdotal evidence, and that "the authors seem to deny the existence of a significant part of the negotiation process, and to oversimplify or explain away many of the most troublesome problems inherent in the art and practice of negotiation".&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite journal |last=White |first=James J. |authorlink=James J. White |date=1984 |title=Review: The Pros and Cons of "Getting to YES": Getting to YES by Roger Fisher, William Ury |journal=Journal of Legal Education |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=115–124 |url=http://repository.law.umich.edu/reviews/82/ |jstor=42897936}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no quantitative evidence presented that suggests outcomes using this technique will typically be better than an alternative method, such as positional bargaining.&lt;ref name="White"/&gt;

'''Greater Noida City''' is a north [[India]]n city with a population in excess of 100,000, located in the [[Gautam Budh Nagar district]] of the northern state of [[Uttar Pradesh]].&lt;ref name="census-report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census2011.co.in/census/city/109-greater-noida-city.html|title=City Population Census 2011 -|work=census2011.co.in|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was created under the ''UP Industrial Area Development Act, 1976''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is a part of the [[National Capital Region (India)|National Capital Region]] (NCR) of India. Situated 30&amp;nbsp;km south-east of capital city of [[New Delhi]], it takes around 30 minutes to travel between the cities via the [[Noida-Greater Noida Expressway]].

==History==
In the early 1980s, the [[government of India]] realised that the rapid rate at which Delhi was expanding would result in chaos, so they planned to develop residential and industrial areas around the capital to reduce the demographic burden. Before Greater Noida City, there were two areas that had been developed—[[Gurgaon]], across the border from [[Haryana]], and [[Noida]], across the border with Uttar Pradesh.

Greater Noida Notified Area - 38000 Ha Comprising 124 villages (308&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
Noida's infrastructure was carefully laid out, but the 1990s saw huge growth in the [[Indian economy]]. Migration to cities like Delhi, [[Mumbai]], Kolkata, [[Chennai]], Hyderabad and Bangalore exceeded planning estimates. Noida was developed to accommodate population growth for 20–25 years. The massive population influx from [[Delhi]], however, caused it to overload in a mere 15 years, although [[infill|intake]] is not complete and illegal mining remains a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Police, mining mafia exchange fire in Noida|date=1 May 2014|newspaper=the Times of India|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/Police-mining-mafia-exchange-fire-in-Noida/articleshow/34472318.cms|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502054509/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/Police-mining-mafia-exchange-fire-in-Noida/articleshow/34472318.cms|archivedate=2 May 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bismil Park2811.JPEG|thumb|left|200px|[[Ram Prasad Bismil|Shaheed Bismil Park]], Sector-Beta 1 in Greater Noida City]]

The [[government of Uttar Pradesh]] decided to develop another city as an extension to Noida with better [[Urban planning|planning]]. The idea was to create a world-class city approximately 25&amp;nbsp;km from Noida. A railway station near [[Boraki Railway Station|Boraki]] and an international airport were included later in the plan intending to develop Greater Noida as an independent city.

During the 1990s, the Noida extension (now a part of [[Gautam Buddh Nagar]]) became what is today known as Greater Noida. The development of the city is managed by the Greater NOIDA Authority. Greater Noida is connected to [[Agra]] by the six-lane [[Yamuna Expressway]]. The annual [[Indian Grand Prix]] is held at the [[Buddh International Circuit]]. Roads are wide with service lanes for every major road. The sectors are named by letters of the [[Greek alphabet]]. All cabling and utilities have been built underground. Alpha, Beta, and Gamma are the oldest sectors. The other emerging sectors include Xu, Delta, Mu, Omicron and Tau. The present GNIDA office is in Gamma&amp;nbsp;II sector just opposite the historical village Rampur Jagir/Jahangir where the revolutionary [[Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil]] lived in 1919 when he was hidden underground after the [[Mainpuri]] conspiracy. A park has been named "Amar Shaheed Pt. Ram Prasad Bismil Udyan" by the Uttar Pradesh Government.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news |title=वतन की ख्वाहिशों पे जिंदगानी कुर्बान(en:Sacrifice of life for homeland) |first= |last= |newspaper= ''Dainik Jagran'' ([[Hindi]] Jagran City-Greater Noida) [[New Delhi]]|page=24 |date=12 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 12th, 14th and 16th [[Auto Expo]]s (The Motor Show) were held at India Expo Mart, Greater Noida, in February 2014, 2016 and 2018 respectively.
In 2018, Gamma was officially declared as the capital of Greater noida.

=== Greater Noida (West) ===
Greater Noida West, previously known as Noida extension, is a part of Greater Noida and consists of 16 villages: Khairpur Gurjar, Shahberi, [[Devla]], [[Patwari]], Ghanghola, [[Bisrakh]], Roza-Yakubpur, [[Haibatpur]], Itaida, Patwari, Aminabad, Asadallapur, [[Maincha]] and [[Chipyana Buzurg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetalkingbrick.com/blog/2013/03/the-number-game-at-noida-extension-property/ The number game at Noida Extension property].

As of late 2012, plans were being formed to rename it to Greater Noida (West). Planners intended the area to provide [[National Capital Region (India)|NCR]] region housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-09-15/noida/33862299_1_noida-extension-greater-noida-land-acquisition-row In 2018, Gamma was officially declared as the capital of Greater noida.|title=Noida Extension to now be called Greater Noida (West)|work=Times of India|author=Vandana Keelor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
As per provisional data of the 2011 census, Greater Noida had a population of 107,676, with 58,662 males and 49,014 females. The literacy rate was 86.54%, 91.48% of males and 80.65% of females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/paper2/data_files/India2/Table_3_PR_UA_Citiees_1Lakh_and_Above.pdf | title = Urban Agglomerations/Cities having population 1 lakh and above |work= Provisional Population Totals, Census of India 2011  |accessdate = 7 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The demographics of Greater Noida mainly consist of students, corporate employees, and labourers.

Horasis  provides a platform for cooperation and knowledge-sharing, particularly between developed countries and emerging markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesstoday.co.om/disCon.aspx?Cval=908 |title=Article: Emerging markets to the fore |publisher=Businesstoday.co.om |date= |accessdate=2013-07-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314210959/http://www.businesstoday.co.om/disCon.aspx?Cval=908|archivedate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community works principally through partnerships with corporations, governments and international organizations, often serving as an incubator for new initiatives.These meetings rotate amongst host countries which stage the events;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/mcit.nsf/0/69FAA238A35E51B4C225787000247859?OpenDocument |title=Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism - Archived Speeches/Articles/Interviews - Global Russia Business Meeting, address by Minister of Commerce |publisher=Mcit.gov.cy |date=2011-04-11 |accessdate=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; selected corporations supplement speeches and presentations about actual topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofcyprus.com.cy/en-GB/Cyprus/News-Archive/The-Bank-of-Cyprus-at-the-Global-Russia-Business-Meeting/ |title=The Bank of Cyprus at the Global Russia Business Meeting - Bank of Cyprus Country Cyprus |publisher=Bankofcyprus.com.cy |date=2011-04-18 |accessdate=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwc.com/lu/en/china/global-china-business-meeting.jhtml |title=Global China Business Meeting by PwC PwC Luxembourg |publisher=Pwc.com |date=2010-11-22 |accessdate=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horasis meetings are usually held in a host country outside the   geographic location of the 'in-focus' nation. The events are a means for the countries 'in focus' as guests (China, India, and South East Asia) to promote relations with the world and to display [[soft power]] through co-option and cooperation. The meetings are also a platform for the  host country to engage in  policy dialogue with the guest countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gouvernement.lu/salle_presse/discours/premier_ministre/2010/11-novembre/22-juncker/index.html |title=Jean-Claude Juncker, Discours à l'occasion du Global China Business Meeting, Luxembourg |publisher=Gouvernement.lu |date=2010-11-22 |accessdate=2013-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323003412/http://www.gouvernement.lu/salle_presse/discours/premier_ministre/2010/11-novembre/22-juncker/index.html |archivedate=2012-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metricstream.com/pressNews/pr_307_horasis_summit_italy_gunjan_sinha.html |title=Gunjan Sinha to participate in the Horasis Summit in Naples, Italy – Press Release |publisher=Metricstream.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hristo Atanasov Kovachki''' ({{lang-bg|Христо Атанасов Ковачки}}) is a [[Bulgaria]]n businessman and entrepreneur born on 17 December 1962 in the town of [[Samokov]] ([[Bulgaria]]). He is married to the former pop folk singer Desislava, with whom he has two children - a daughter Alexandra and a son Hristo. He graduated in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] as a doctor of technical sciences and is an owner of a number of companies, as he has business interests in the field of energy as well. He is attributed the role of informal leader of the political party [[Lider (political party)|LIDER]].

== Education ==

In 1980 Hristo Kovachki graduated from the Secondary School of Mathematics in his hometown [[Samokov]]. He was admitted to study higher education at [[LIFMO]] (Leningrad Institute of Fine Mechanics and Optics) in the city of [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. Interested in science, in 1991 he successfully completed a Ph.D study by defending dissertation thesis ''Use of lasers in microelectronics''. In 1994 he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Technical Sciences by the aforementioned university. In 2013 he was awarded the degree of "professor" by the International Slavonic Academy in [[Moscow]]. He is fluent in Russian, English and French. Hristo Kovachki is the author of a number of inventions, which are applied in laser technology, electronics and the energy sector.

== Early career ==

After his graduation Hristo Kovachki works on projects related to laser technologies. In parallel, he also elaborates and patents various inventions in [[Bulgaria]], [[Russia]] and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;http://personi.dir.bg/person.php?id=2476&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1992 he develops his own business.

== Business ==

In the late 1990s Hristo Kovachki started developing his business interests in the field of energy.

He participates in the governing bodies of several energy companies. His name is linked to privatization deals in the mining industry (Beli Breg Mine, Stanyantsi Mine, MOV-Pernik, Bobov Dol Coalmining, Balkan Mine, Black Sea Mine, Chukurovo Mine) and the energy sector  (TPP Dimitrovgrad, TPP Bobov Dol, Brikel - Galabovo, which is the only producer of briquettes within the Balkans).

It is believed that he is associated with a number of district heating companies in the country, both gas- and coal-based, in the towns of Burgas, Sliven, Pernik, Gabrovo, Vratsa, Pleven, Ruse, Veliko Tarnovo.&lt;ref&gt;http://paper.standartnews.com/bg/article.php?d=2006-06-12&amp;article=149330&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==

=== LIDER ===

In 2007 the party [[Lider (political party)|LIDER]] (Liberal Initiative for Democratic European Development) was founded, which was initially linked to Hristo Kovachki. In the years to follow political party LIDER (PP LIDER) has taken part with varying success in the local and national election campaigns, as in most of them it has run in coalition with other parties.

In the autumn of 2014 PP [[Lider (political party)|LIDER]] participated in the parliamentary elections for the 43rd National Assembly in coalition with Bulgaria Without Censorship (BWC) and Agrarian People's Union (APU). At the said parliamentary elections PP [[Lider (political party)|LIDER]] marked its greatest success and appointed five MPs to the parliament. This happened shortly before the decline of PP [[Lider (political party)|LIDER]] and the birth of a new political project, Bulgarian Democratic Centre ([[BDC (political party)|BDC]]).

=== Bulgarian Democratic Centre ===

On 22.03.2015 the party [[Lider (political party)|LIDER]] was renamed Bulgarian Democratic Centre ([[BDC (political party)|BDC]]), which is a centrist conservative party in terms of its views. To date, Bulgarian Democratic Centre is successfully represented at the 43rd National Assembly.

== Book ==

In 2013 Hristo Kovachki released his first book to date entitled ''Universal order - theory of cognition''. The book concerns a multitude of issues, starting with universal order, passing through biblical order, as the focus dwells on the theory of cognition and its various manifestations. The statement section formulates and discusses in detail the seven fundamental principles of cognition theory:
* '''First principle:''' The process of cognition is creative, positive, free and infinite;
* '''Second principle:''' The process of cognition is based on a reasonable form of existence of matter - reasonable individuals. The process of cognition is more powerful when this reasonable form of matter exists in harmony;
* '''Third principle:''' The more actively an individual participates in the cognition process, the higher form he will attain, both within society and within the entire civilization;
* '''Fourth principle:''' The greater the number of individuals is, the more intensified the cognition process will be.
* '''Fifth principle:''' The cognition process is based on reasonable forms of matter, which are reproducible.
* '''Sixth principle:''' The cognition process is a self-regulating process.
* '''Seventh principle:''' The cognition process is an evolutionary process.&lt;ref name="Hristo Kovachki reference 6"&gt;{{cite news |url=|title=Kovachki Hr., ''Universal order - theory of cognition'', published by ''Zahari Stoyanov'', Sofia, 2013.|accessdate=|date= |language= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two corollaries are also inferred from these seven principles: 
* The cognition process underlies the foundation of generating the social product. The more stimulated the cognition process is, the greater the social product will be.
* The social product produced by society should be distributed on a fair (prorated) basis among the members of this society in accordance with their participation in the cognition process.&lt;ref name="Hristo Kovachki reference 6"/&gt;

== Wealth status ==

The Polish news weekly Wprost releases at the end of each year a list of "Top 100 Richest Central and Eastern Europeans". In 2008 three Bulgarians were included in the ranking - [[Vasil Bozhikov|Vasil Bozhkov]] in the 61st, - Hristo Kovachki in the 98th and [[Valentin Zlatev]] in the 100th position. According to the publication the wealth of Hristo Kovachki is estimated at $700 million. The amount is calculated based on the value of assets managed by Kovachki at the time.

Hristo Kovachki occupies fourteenth place in the ranking of the most influential Bulgarians in 2013 by Forbes magazine. He is followed by the businessmen [[Sasho Donchev]], [[Grisha Ganchev]], [[Bogomil Manchev]], [[Vasil Bozhikov|Vasil Bozhkov]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;http://forbesbulgaria.bg/%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B9-%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5-%D0%B1%D1%8A%D0%BB%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8-2013-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B5-%D0%BC/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14274">The '''ISM ''Report On Business''&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; (ROB)''', popularly known as the ISM Report, is the collective name for two monthly reports, the '''Manufacturing ISM ''Report On Business'''''&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; and the '''Non-Manufacturing ISM ''Report On Business'''''&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, published by [[Institute for Supply Management]]. The ROB is based on a national survey of purchasing managers tracking changes in the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors. It is considered to be one of the most reliable economic barometers of the U.S. economy and gives an important early look at the health of the nation’s economy.&lt;ref name="Bauhohl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baumohl |first=Bernard |date=2005 |title= Hidden Clues to Future Economic Trends and Investment Opportunities|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Wharton School Publishing |pages=147–156 |isbn= 978-0132932073}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being market moving, the ROB makes an important contribution to the American statistical system and to economic policy. It also has one of the shortest reporting lags of any macroeconomic series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Griffis |first=Michael |date=2011 |title= Economic Indicators for Dummies |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=203 |isbn= 978-1-118-16389-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The origin of the Manufacturing ISM ''Report On Business''&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; can be traced back to 1923 when ISM, then known then as the National Association of Purchasing Agents (N.A.P.A.), adopted a polling technique to survey its members on commodities across the country. The results of these surveys were published in the association's membership publication. For three years, there was no solid structure or guidelines on the implementation of the surveys. Then, in 1926, N.A.P.A. selected Edward T. Gushee, a purchaser from Detroit, Michigan, as the chairman to supervise the activities of this survey group and decided to expand the scope of information gathered from its membership for the survey.  
In 1930, the United States was still experiencing the drastic economic impact of the stock market collapse and the [[Great Depression]]. In office for a little over one year, U.S. President [[Herbert Hoover]], faced with the traumatic difficulties brought on by these events, was looking for answers. The President and other leading businessmen were concerned over the lack of information to assist them in resolving the economic conditions in the United States. The [[United States Chamber of Commerce|U.S. Chamber of Commerce]] had organized, with President Hoover's approval, a committee to gather pertinent business data from companies who were members of the Chamber. However, after numerous efforts to gather information, the committee was disbanded in June 1931. John R. Whitehead, who was the recently elected president of N.A.P.A. and represented the association on this committee, wanted to continue the efforts of the committee. He believed that this was a project the purchasing association could carry on, not only for the benefit of the country's economy but also to assist purchasing professionals with performing a more effective job for their organizations during these difficult times. George A. Renard, the executive secretary of N.A.P.A. at the time, agreed with Whitehead on conducting the program. Under the leadership of Whitehead and Renard, the newly founded Business Survey Committee surveyed the association membership on current business conditions. Renard tabulated the results and then sent them directly to President Hoover.
In view of the positive feedback from N.A.P.A. members and the government on the surveys, N.A.P.A. was inspired to survey its members and release the information on a regular basis. Except for a four-year interruption during [[World War II]], because of the difficulty of businesses operating under full-scale war conditions, ISM (and its predecessors) have published the report  since 1931 for its membership and other interested organizations and individuals.&lt;ref name="Bauhohl" /&gt;

==Manufacturing ISM ''Report On Business'' featuring the PMI==
While the manufacturing report has been published since 1931, in the early 1980s, the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]] (DOC) and ISM developed the [[Purchasing Managers' Index]] (PMI). The index, based on analytical work by the DOC, adjusts four of the five components of ISM's monthly survey — new orders, production, employment, supplier and deliveries — for normal seasonal variations, adds in inventories, applies equal weights to each and then calculates them into a single monthly index number. An update of research originally done by Theodore S. Torda, the late economist for the DOC, shows a close parallel between growth in real [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) and the PMI. The index can explain about 60 percent of the annual variation in GDP, with a margin of error that averaged ± .48 percent during the last ten years. George McKittrick, a former economist at the DOC, said "Not only does the PMI&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; track well with the overall economy, but the indication provided by ISM data about how widespread changes are, complements analogous government series that show size and direction of change." In January 1989, the Supplier Deliveries Index from the Report became a standard element of the DOC's Bureau of Economic Analysis Index of Leading Economic Indicators. The data was incorporated into the index from June 1976 forward. In January 1996, The Conference Board began compiling this index.

==Non-Manufacturing ISM ''Report On Business''==
The origin of the Non-Manufacturing ISM ''Report On Business''&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; can be traced to 1996. Over the years, there had been a shift in ISM's membership from nearly 100 percent manufacturing firms in the 1930s to almost 50 percent non-manufacturing firms by 1996 such as:
*	[[Financial services]]
*	[[Healthcare industry|Health services]]
*	[[Transport]]ation
*	Communication
*	[[Public administration]]
Also, by this time, the non-manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy was responsible for about 80 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the primary measure of economic activity. There also was a trend toward the non-manufacturing share of the economy continuing to increase in the future. While the existing ISM ''Manufacturing Report On Business''&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; was well-accepted as one of the primary indicators of overall U.S. economic activity, ISM felt that to fully capture all economic activity and to enable all members of ISM to participate in the survey, a non-manufacturing version of the ''Report On Business'' should be considered. As a result, in 1996, it formed a committee to explore the development of the Non-manufacturing ISM ''Report On Business''&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;. By the spring of 1997 the pilot was considered successful. In July of that year, routine monthly data collection began.

Monthly public reporting and release of data debuted in June 1998 with the release of the May 1998 data and ten months of data history. The Non-Manufacturing ISM ''Report On Business''&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; is released on the third business day of each month, and is based on data compiled from monthly surveys sent to nominally 350 purchasing executives working in the non-manufacturing industries across the country. The process, content and format of the report parallel that of the manufacturing report with only a few differences. Each month, the survey responses reflect change, if any, in the current month's report compared to the previous month. The report covers:
*	Non-Manufacturing Index (NMI)
*	Business Activity
*	New Orders
*	Backlog of Orders
*	New Export Orders
*	Inventory Change
*	Inventory Sentiment
*	Imports
*	Prices
*	Employment
*	Supplier Deliveries
The Non-Manufacturing Index (NMI) which is a weighted composite index for non-manufacturing data (similar to the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)) was developed and first published in the January 2008 Non-Manufacturing ISM ''Report On Business''&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;. This was not available prior to that date because there was insufficient non-manufacturing historical data to develop a composite index.

==Methodology==
All the ISM indexes are [[dynamic factor|diffusion indexes]] and are indicators of month-to-month change. The percent response to the "Better," "Same," or "Worse" question is difficult to compare to prior periods; therefore, ISM diffuses the percentages for this purpose. A diffusion index indicates the degree to which the indicated change is dispersed or diffused throughout the sample population. Respondents to ISM surveys indicate each month whether particular activities (e.g., new orders) for their organizations have increased, decreased, or remained unchanged from the previous month. The ISM indexes are calculated by taking the percentage of respondents that report that the activity has increased ("Better") and adding it to one-half of the percentage that report the activity has not changed ("Same") and adding the two percentages. Using half of the "Same" percentage effectively measures the bias toward a positive (above 50 percent) or negative index. As an example of calculating a diffusion index, if the response is 20 percent "Better," 70 percent "Same," and 10 percent "Worse," the Diffusion Index would be 55 percent (20% + [0.50 x 70%]). A reading of 50 percent indicates "no change" from the previous month.
Economists and statisticians have determined that the farther the index is away from the amount that would indicate "no change" (50 percent), the rate of change is greater. Therefore, an index of 60% indicates a faster rate of increase than an index of 55% (increased activity is becoming more dispersed), and an index of 35% indicates a faster rate of decrease than an index of 40% (decreased activity is becoming more dispersed). A value of 100 indicates all respondents are reporting increased activity while 0 indicates that all respondents report decreased activity.

==Sections of the Reports==
'''Manufacturing:'''

*	PMI 
*	New Orders: reflects the levels of new orders from customers.
*	Production: measures the rate and direction of change, if any, in the level of production.
*	Employment: reports the rate of increase or decrease in the level of employment.
*	Supplier Deliveries: reveals if deliveries from suppliers are faster or slower.
*	Inventories: reflects the increases and/or decreases in inventory levels.
*	Customer Inventories: rates the level of inventories the organization's customers have.
*	Prices: reports whether organizations are paying more or less for product(s)/service(s).

Both include general commentary and a list of commodities that are up in price, down in price and listed in short supply.

==Seasonal Adjustments==
Seasonal adjustments are made each year in the January reports. The seasonal adjustments are developed by an outside party, formerly the U.S. Department of Commerce, and provided to ISM. As of January 2012, the indexes that are seasonally adjusted are:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
'''Manufacturing:'''
*	New Orders
*	Production
*	Employment
*	Supplier Deliveries
{{col-break}}
'''Non-Manufacturing:'''
*	Business Activity
*	New Orders
*	Employment
*	Prices
{{col-end}}

==Semiannual Forecasts==
The ISM Semiannual Report, released in May and December, provides insight into both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors of the U.S. economy. The data in the current report compares information from the previous report versus what current conditions are. This report also offers a forecast for the next six months.

==Historical Data==
Historical data is available through subscription.

==Media==
Most major financial media agencies cover the Report each month on the first and third business day of the month. Articles regularly appear in [[Wall Street Journal|The Wall Street Journal]], [[Financial Times]], [[MarketWatch]], [[Market News International|MNI]], [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] and others.

==Controversy==
On June 2, 2014, ISM released the ROB and then revised it twice in the span of about two-and-a-half hours, a highly unusual event. The initial figure of 53.2 was lower than anticipated and indicated a slowing of the pace of factory-sector growth, and this caused stocks to dip instantly. Economists immediately queried the accuracy of the report and determined that ISM had incorrectly applied seasonal adjustments from the previous month.

ISM's final correction of 55.4 was almost in line with [[Wall Street]] expectations, indicating brisk growth, and the stock market rebounded quickly and closed the day with a modest gain. In a statement, ISM attributed the errant report to a software glitch that "incorrectly used the seasonal adjustment factor from the previous month."

'''Ian C. Read''' (born 1953) is a Scottish-born American business executive, a chartered accountant, and the chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of [[Pfizer]], serving since 2010.&lt;ref name="Forbes_2015_10_13" /&gt;. He will be succeeded as CEO by [[Albert Bourla]] on 1 January 2019, becoming executive chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/01/pfizer-announces-dr-albert-bourla-will-succeed-ceoian-read-effective-january-1.html|title=Pfizer to replace longtime CEO Read with veteran Bourla|first=|last=CNBC|date=1 October 2018|website=cnbc.com|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Read was born in [[Forfar]], Scotland, to a Scottish mother, but his parents returned to [[Rhodesia]] (now Zimbabwe) when he was six-weeks-old, and he grew up there.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Andrew|title=Pfizer chief’s Scottish roots buried by a reluctance to plant the flag|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/health/article4088832.ece|accessdate=23 September 2015|work=The Times|date=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Read received a bachelor's degree in [[chemical engineering]] from [[Imperial College London]] in 1974. He qualified as a chartered accountant in 1978.&lt;ref name=Businessweek/&gt;

==Career==
Read has spent his entire career with [[Pfizer]], starting in 1978 as an operational auditor.&lt;ref name="Forbes_2015_10_13" /&gt; He worked in Latin America through 1995, holding positions ranging from CFO of Pfizer Mexico (Pfizer's largest subsidiary in Latin America) to country manager of Brazil.  In 1996, he was appointed president of the Pfizer International Pharmaceuticals Group, Latin America/Canada.  He assumed the position of executive vice president—Europe/Canada in May 2000, added the responsibilities for Africa/Middle East region as of January 2004 and responsibilities for Latin America in March 2006.  He was named vice president of Pfizer in 2001 and promoted to president of worldwide pharmaceutical operations in 2006.&lt;ref name="Forbes_2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2010/12/05/business-health-care-us-pfizer-ceo-resigns-bio-box_8183721.html|title=Biographical information on Pfizer CEO Ian Read | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216022742/https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2010/12/05/business-health-care-us-pfizer-ceo-resigns-bio-box_8183721.html | archivedate=16 December 2010 | work=Forbes | date=5 December 2010 | accessdate=20 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC_News_2010"&gt;{{citation|date=6 December 2010|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-11924216 |title=Pfizer's Jeffrey Kindler resigns as chief executive|work=BBC News | accessdate=15 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is a member of the Pfizer Leadership Team.&lt;ref name="Pfizer_2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfizer.com/about/leadership_and_structure/leadership_executives_read.jsp |title=Home &amp;#124; Pfizer: One of the world's premier biopharmaceutical companies |publisher=Pfizer |date= |accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 December 2010,&lt;ref name=Businessweek/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes_2015_10_13" /&gt; When Read "took over from Jeffrey Kindler as Pfizer’s CEO, the drug firm–the world’s largest–was facing the impending patent expiration of Lipitor, the bestselling drug ever made, and the utter failure of one of the most lavishly funded research laboratories on the planet to develop much of anything."&lt;ref name="Forbes_2015_10_13" /&gt; Read is also a director of [[Kimberly-Clark]].&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite web|title=Ian Read|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/ian-read/|website=Forbes|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Read is now an American citizen.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rushe|first1=Dominic|title=Pfizer's Ian Read: slow and steady wins the day|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/04/pfizer-boss-ian-read-profile-astrazeneca-takeover|accessdate=6 November 2014|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By October 2015 during the Drug Pricing Firestorm, [[Forbes]] journalist Matthew Herper, wrote how "Read, with his calculating mind, must get through the public’s rage over six-figure price tags for breakthrough drugs and yet keep Pfizer’s pricing power more or less intact. Doing so is absolutely critical: 34% of Pfizer’s revenue growth over the past three years has come from increasing prices on existing drugs, according to SSR, a Stamford, Conn.-based consulting firm. New medicines, especially for cancer, are selling for $100,000-plus–prices that were unimaginable five years ago."&lt;ref name="Forbes_2015_10_13"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2015/10/13/why-viagra-keeps-going-up-pfizers-ceo-on-the-drug-pricing-controversy/ | title=Pfizer's CEO Faces The Drug Pricing Firestorm | work=Forbes | date=2 November 2015 | accessdate=15 November 2015 | author=Herper, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4964">'''Indirect costs''' are costs that are not directly accountable to a [[cost object]] (such as a particular project, facility, function or product). Indirect costs may be either fixed or variable. Indirect costs include administration, personnel and security costs. These are those costs which are not directly related to production. Some indirect costs may be [[overhead (business)|overhead]]. But some overhead costs can be directly attributed to a project and are direct costs.

There are two types of indirect costs. One are the fixed indirect costs which contains activities or costs that are fixed for a particular project or company like transportation of labor to the working site, building temporary roads, etc. The other are recurring indirect costs which contains activities that repeat for a particular company like maintenance of records or payment of salaries.

==Indirect vs direct costs==
Most [[cost estimate]]s are broken down into direct costs and indirect costs.

Direct costs are directly attributable to the  object and it is financially feasible to do so. In construction, the costs of materials, labor, equipment, etc., and all directly involved efforts or expenses for the cost object are direct costs. In manufacturing or other non-construction industries the portion of operating costs that is directly assignable to a specific product or process is a direct cost.&lt;ref&gt;''Standard AACE International Recommended Practice No. 10S-90 COST ENGINEERING TERMINOLOGY TCM Framework: General Reference,'' Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering International, 2010, Pg 35&lt;/ref&gt; Direct costs are those for activities or services that benefit specific projects, for example salaries for project staff and materials required for a particular project. Because these activities are easily traced to projects, their costs are usually charged to projects on an item-by-item basis.

Indirect costs are, but not necessarily, not directly attributable to a cost object. It should be financially infeasible to do so. Indirect costs are typically allocated to a cost object on some basis. In construction, all costs which are required for completion of the installation, but are not directly attributable to the cost object are indirect, such as overhead. In manufacturing, costs not directly assignable to the end product or process are indirect. These may be costs for management, insurance, taxes, or maintenance, for example.&lt;ref&gt;''Standard AACE International Recommended Practice No. 10S-90 COST ENGINEERING TERMINOLOGY TCM Framework: General Reference,'' Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering International, 2010, Pg 49&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect costs are those for activities or services that benefit more than one project. Their precise benefits to a specific project are often difficult or impossible to trace. For example, it may be difficult to determine precisely how the activities of the director of an organization benefit a specific project. Indirect costs do not vary substantially within certain production volumes or other indicators of activity, and so they may sometimes be considered to be fixed costs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accountingtools.com/questions-and-answers/what-are-indirect-costs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to justify the handling of almost any kind of cost as either direct or indirect. Labor costs, for example, can be indirect, as in the case of maintenance personnel and executive officers; or they can be direct, as in the case of project staff members. Similarly, materials such as miscellaneous supplies purchased in bulk—pencils, pens, paper—are typically handled as indirect costs, while materials required for specific projects are charged as direct costs.

==Examples==
Be cautious here, because the nature of the cost depends on the industry. For example, fuel cost in a telecom is usually allocated as an indirect cost, while for an airliner it is a direct cost.

===Costs usually charged directly===
* Salary/wages
* Consultants
* Materials
* Tools
* Transport
* Labor
* Direct materials
* PPC
* Any kind of subcontract which is attributable to direct works but the specific company does not possess the required skill

===Costs either charged directly or allocated indirectly===
* Directors Salary (this is usually an indirect cost)
* Electricity (mostly if it needs allocation it is always indirect)

Note that if electricity is not used as primary source for production then electricity cost will be treated as utility and is always indirect. For example, if electricity is required to run the boiler which in turn generates steam, then electricity which needs to be allocated directly.

===Costs usually allocated indirectly===
* Indirect costs related to transport
* Administration cost
* Selling &amp; distribution cost
* Office cost
* Security cost

[[Intellectual property]] (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as [[Invention|inventions]]; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce.

IP is protected in law by, for example, [[Patent|patents]], [[copyright]] and [[Trademark|trademarks]], which enable people to earn recognition or financial benefit from what they invent or create. By striking the right balance between the interests of innovators and the wider public interest, the IP system aims to foster an environment in which creativity and innovation can flourish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Types of intellectual property typically include: 
* Copyright
* Patents
* Trademarks
* [[Industrial design|Industrial designs]]
* [[Geographical indication|Geographical indications]]

In today’s highly competitive [[consumer electronics]] industry, given the nature of the products and the quality of the market, Patents and Industrial designs are arguably becoming the most concerned types of intellectual property.

== The necessity of protecting intellectual property in consumer electronics industry ==
First, patents and industrial designs have a strong presence in the consumer electronics industry. As evidenced by the steady stream of novel high-tech offerings and the rate at which the latest gadgets become ‘‘[[Obsolescence|obsolete]],’’ companies in the electrical industry invest millions in [[research and development]] to meet the immense demand for new, useful technologies, and to help bring to market the next wave of cutting-edge products for consumers. The fruits of this research and development - which gives rise to the technologies themselves or to a key component of a particular products’ functionality - are typically protected through patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Second, the consequence of leaking patents and industrial designs could be devastating. One of the examples is the series of ongoing lawsuits between [[Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co.|Apple and Samsung]] regarding the design of smartphones and tablet computers. 

== Practice in developing a company’s IP protection measures ==
On strategic level, a common practice is to develop an effective IP protection strategy. The following steps is commonly used in establishing such strategy:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

* the first step is to identify the [[Strategic management|corporate strategy]] and determine the best means for aligning the corporate strategy with the IP strategy
* in order to properly identify IP [[Asset|assets]], it is critical that a thorough IP audit be performed by personnel within the corporation who are knowledgeable or familiar with the company’s IP or the company’s technology plan.
* determining whether the identified IP assets are core assets
* properly allocating corporate resources to core and non-core IP assets
* setting up a program for periodic review of IP assets
On operational level, and given that the development phase usually involves developing various [[Prototype|prototypes]] and [[Blueprint|blueprints]] and sometimes have to work with third party vendors under circumstances, establishing a secrecy program throughout the whole project team would be beneficial in mitigating the leak risk. The following is a list of key questions need to be asked in the development phase of such secrecy program.
* Identify the external and internal parties and understand the roles and responsibilities
* Consider legal options on the table prior to engaging. For internal team/staff, [[Non-disclosure agreement|NDA]] is the minimum requirement. For external party, [[master service agreement]] (MSA) along with vendor obligation and [[Penalty clause|penalty clauses]] is a favorable option.
* Enforcing ongoing secrecy protection program. The elements that could put into the program include the statement of security responsibilities for vendors, the right to perform IP compliance and security compliance vendor assessment at the company’s discretion.
* Establishing Information security requirements.
* Conduct IP protection and secrecy awareness training to all required person.
* Determine leak investigation capacity

== History ==
[[File:McAfee logo.png|thumb|Former McAfee logo with the Intel byline.]]

=== Early years ===
The company was founded in 1987 as McAfee Associates, named for its founder [[John McAfee]], who resigned from the company in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bernabeo | first =Paul  | title = Inventors and Inventions, Volume 4| url = https://books.google.com/?id=YcPvV893aXgC| year = 2008| publisher = Marshall Cavendish | isbn = 0761477675| page = 1033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  McAfee was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1992.  Network Associates was formed in 1997 as a merger of McAfee Associates, [[NetScout Systems, Inc.|Network General]], [[PGP Corporation]] and [[Helix Software]].

The company restructured in 2004, beginning with the sale of its [[Magic Solutions, Inc.|Magic Solutions]] business to [[Remedy Corporation|Remedy]], a subsidiary of [[BMC Software]] early in the year.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} In mid-2004, the company sold the Sniffer Technologies business to a venture capital backed firm named [[Network General]] (the same name as the original owner of Sniffer Technologies), and changed its name back to McAfee to reflect its focus on security-related technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Computer Desktop Encyclopedia|title=McAfee|url=https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/mcafee|website=TheFreeDictionary.com|publisher=The Computer Language Co. Inc.|accessdate=7 May 2018|location=Pennsylvania (US)|date=1981-2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Open source ===
Among other companies bought and sold by McAfee is [[Trusted Information Systems]], which developed the Firewall Toolkit, the [[free software]] foundation for the commercial Gauntlet Firewall, which was later sold to [[Secure Computing Corporation]].

McAfee, as a result of brief ownership of TIS Labs/NAI Labs/Network Associates Laboratories/McAfee Research, was highly influential in the world of [[Open Source]] software, as that organization produced portions of the [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], and [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]] operating systems, and developed portions of the [[BIND]] name server software and [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]] version 3.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

=== Encryption technologies ===
McAfee had acquired [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]], Canada-based [[FSA Corporation]], which helped the company diversify its security offerings away from just client-based [[antivirus]] software by bringing on board its own network and desktop encryption technologies.

The FSA team also oversaw the creation of a number of other technologies that were leading edge at the time, including [[Firewall (computer)|firewall]], [[file encryption]], and [[public key infrastructure]] product lines. While those product lines had their own individual successes including PowerBroker (written by Dean Huxley and Dan Freedman and now sold by [[BeyondTrust]]), the growth of antivirus ware always outpaced the growth of the other security product lines. It is fair to say that McAfee remains best known for its anti-virus and anti-spam products.

=== Acquisition by Intel and spin-off ===
On August 19, 2010, [[Intel]] announced that it would purchase McAfee for $48 a share in a deal valued at $7.68&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.intel.com/community/intel_newsroom/blog/2010/08/19/intel-to-acquire-mcafee |title=Intel to Acquire McAfee |date=August 19, 2010 |accessdate=August 19, 2010 |publisher=[[Intel Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Johnson |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_15826282/2010-intel-buy-mcafee-purchase-security-software |title=2010: Intel to buy McAfee: Chip giant to acquire software maker for $7.68B – The Mercury News |website=Mercurynews.com |date= |accessdate=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation from university, Aven was a senior researcher at the All-Union Institute for Systems Studies at the [[USSR]] Academy of Sciences and then spent time at the [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]] in [[Laxenburg]], [[Austria]] (1989–1991).

Concerning Russian economic reform in the early 1990s, he and other reformer colleagues had consulted with foreign academics by 1990 on trying to find a new system. When [[Boris Yeltsin]] became president, he appointed Aven with the task of making the ruble convertible and finding a solution to foreign debt.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yale.edu/2017/11/13/aven-offers-inside-account-making-modern-russia&lt;/ref&gt; Aven went on to become the Minister of Foreign Economic Relations for the Russian Federation (1991–1992), serving as [[Russia]]'s representative to the [[G7|Group of Seven]] and conducting a number of high-level trade and economic missions to Western capitals. In 1993 he joined the [[Democratic Choice of Russia|Russia's Choice]] movement and was a candidate for State Duma.

In October 1994, Aven met [[Alfa Group]]'s [[Mikhail Fridman]], and soon became an Alfa Bank shareholder serving as a member of the Supervisory Board of the Alfa Group Consortium. From 1994 until June 2011, he served as the President of [[Alfa-Bank]] Russia. Currently Aven is a Member of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Board of Directors of ABH Holdings S.A.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alfabank.com/governance/board/aven/ Petr Aven profile.] Alfa-Bank Board of Directors.

The L1 Group owns companies – and has equity investments in companies – with operations in 32 countries around the world.

LetterOne acquired assets from German utility business E. ON in October 2015, in a deal worth $1.6bn, that saw the Luxembourg-based group gain Norwegian oil and gas resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=E.ON agrees 1 billion pound sale of North Sea assets to Fridman|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/10/14/uk-northsea-m-a-e-on-idUKKCN0S80TV20151014|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following month, LetterOne also announced their intention to deal with Brazilian telecoms company Oi SA, and boost their presence in the mobile phone sector there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fridman Offers $4 Billion to Merge Brazil Carriers Oi, Tim|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-26/oi-may-get-up-to-4-billion-from-letter-one-in-tim-deal|publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 1890 by the original San Miguel Brewery (renamed San Miguel Corporation in 1964), it is the largest selling beer in the Philippines and Hong Kong. It is known in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] as 生力啤酒. San Miguel Beer was introduced in Spain by San Miguel Brewery in 1946. In 1953, its Spanish rights were spun-off by San Miguel Brewery and became an independent entity presently known as the [[Mahou-San Miguel Group]].

==San Miguel Beer (Spain)==

=== Background ===
As part of its overseas expansion, San Miguel moved into the Spanish market in 1953, setting up the company which would later become San Miguel Spain. Since 1946, there has been a company engaged in the production of malt for medicinal purposes known as La Segarra.  In the early 1950s, its key shareholders Enrique Suárez Rezona, Ramón Vidal and Jaime Muñiz made contact with [[Andrés Soriano]], then president of San Miguel Brewery, to allow them to produce beer under the San Miguel name in Spain. In 1953, San Miguel Brewery, Inc. signed the “Manila Agreement”, with the Philippine brewer setting up a new Spanish brewery, La Segarra, S.A. The company would later be renamed San Miguel Fabricas de Cerveza y Malta, S.A. in 1957, an affiliate of San Miguel Brewery, Inc. which initially held 20% equity share via its Hong Kong subsidiary.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The company was acquired by Mahou, S.A. from Groupe Danone in 2000, combining to form Spain’s largest brewer, the Mahou-San Miguel Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sanmiguel.com.ph/article/san-miguel-brewing-international-ltd-and-mahou-san-miguel-sign-a-cooperation-agreement San Miguel Brewing International Ltd. and Mahou-San Miguel sign a cooperation agreement&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 February 2014, San Miguel and Mahou-San Miguel signed a co-operation agreement to promote jointly San Miguel Beer and expand its global footprint.

=== History ===

The history of San Miguel traces back to 1890, when a group of Spaniards decided to open the first brewery in Southeast Asia, specifically in Manila. The factory produced diverse types of beers and derivative products under the name “San Miguel”. In the colonial capital no one knew beer until then. For this reason the inauguration of the brewery was a historic event and became known as “The day of San Miguel”.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Expansion to Spain ===

In February 1946 the corporation La Segarra S.A. was formed in Lleida, Catalonia, with the purpose of making beer, although the bureaucratic process caused production to be delayed until 1953. So, in 1954 the Group returned to Spain in a vessel stocked with Asian yeasts that made a 45-day journey across the ocean. In 1957 the Manila Agreement was signed with the president of the San Miguel Corporation, Andres Soriano, and San Miguel, Beers and Malts Factory S.A. was established, independent from the Manila company. From that moment on, the two companies have followed different paths.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Expansion to Africa and Europe ===

In 1965 San Miguel arrived to Africa, and by 1967 it spread to other capitals in Europe like London, Paris and Berlin. In 1970 it bought the Spanish- Dutch beer brand GULDER and its factory in Burgos. The three factories had a capacity of 600,000 hl, achieving a share of 7% of the national market. Thanks to the progressive opening in Spain and the work of the exports department, the 70s were a time of growth in exports of the beer both in Western and Eastern Europe and Northern Africa, reaching an annual figure of 125,000 hl.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Mahou-San Miguel Group ===
The formation of the [[Mahou-San Miguel Group]] traces its origin to Danone stocks. In 1994 the French multinational acquired 18% of San Miguel, Beers and Malts Factory. In 1997 Danone grew its share to 82% and also owned a large part of Mahou. In the following years, Danone lost interest in the company and therefore the beer maker took advantage of the synergy with Mahou, merging the two and becoming Mahou-San Miguel. Later on it also absorbed the beer maker Alhambra of Granada.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==The escudo==

The San Miguel ''escudo'' ([[Seal (emblem)|seal]]) used as the brand logo of all San Miguel branded beer products is based on the original [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish-era]] [[coat of arms of Manila]]. It is also the corporate logo of [[San Miguel Corporation]] and the [[San Miguel Brewery]] companies.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The [[Mahou-San Miguel Group]] does not use this logo for its San Miguel branded beers. Instead, it uses an image of a [[galleon]] as its brand logo.

==San Miguel Beermen==
{{main article|San Miguel Beermen}}
The '''[[San Miguel Beermen]]''' are a professional basketball team in the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] (PBA). The franchise is owned by the [[San Miguel Corporation]] (SMC) since 1975. It is one of three PBA ball clubs owned by the SMC group of companies along with the [[Magnolia Hotshots]] and [[Barangay Ginebra San Miguel]]. It is the only remaining original franchise in the PBA and leads the league with the most number of PBA titles - 23 to date. It is also the only team ever to have won at least one title in each of the five numerical decades of the PBA's existence so far.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6057">'''Shaul Nehamia Eisenberg''' ({{lang-he|שאול אייזנברג}};  1921–1997) was a [[Jewish]] [[businessperson|businessmen]] and a billionaire tycoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title= Shaul Eisenberg|work=[[Toledo Blade|"The Blade"]]| date= March 28, 1997| publisher= | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19970328&amp;id=I7tAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BAQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5756,9829905| accessdate = March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Eisenberg was born in 1921 in [[Munich]] to a religious [[Jewish]] family from [[Poland]]. Shortly after the uprising of the [[Nazis]] in the government, he fled and wandered as a refugee around [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title= BILLIONAIRE SHAUL EISENBERG DIES AT 76| date= March 27, 1997| publisher= | url = http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1997/Billionaire-Shaul-Eisenberg-dies-at-76/id-9e84d41efbf1c9c17bb8fcc450017c12| work = | pages = | accessdate = March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later moved to Japan. In 1941, he married a local woman. During [[World War II]] he worked with industrial factories, associating with the [[Axis Power]] countries. After the war ended, he began working with [[United States|American]] businesses, importing iron products for the Japanese steel industry, when at the same time exporting a variety of Japanese-made products to [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title= Shaul Eisenberg in a New York Times article| date= March 26, 1997| publisher= | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2519&amp;dat=19970326&amp;id=4jFdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HFsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1560,3799378| work = [[New York Times]]| pages = | accessdate = March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the 1950s, Eisenberg expanded his business to other countries in the Far East, especially [[South Korea]], where he invested money while mediating between the local authority to manufacturers from the East that were also doing business there. Among them were: [[British Electric]], [[Siemens]], [[MAN SE]], and [[Fiat Automobiles]]. Within a decade, he managed to mediate a vast variety of projects, such as developing production lines for recycled paper and purchasing airplanes and trains. He got an award from the Korean government for his actions. Until the mid-1960s, Eisenberg was the primary factor and catalyst in the commerce between South Korea and Japan to Western countries. He got high brokerage commissions, and therefore a few of which led to local and international scandals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |coauthors= |authorlink= |title=Shaul Eisenberg on |date=1997-03-20 |publisher= |url=http://www.think-aboutit.com/conspiracy/ShaulEisenberg.htm |work= |pages= |accessdate= |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508195528/http://www.think-aboutit.com/conspiracy/ShaulEisenberg.htm |archivedate=May 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eisenberg Law and his activity in Israel==

Eisenberg founded the company [[Israel Corporation]], and a new law was enacted for him, allowing the company to have a tax break for 30 years. The law, which got its nickname from Eisenberg, was meant to encourage [[entrepreneur]]s. Upon getting these benefits, Eisenberg began mimicking his international actions and do them in Israel as well, which led him to settle in [[Savyon]], Israel. With Israel Corporation he began purchasing some holdings in the companies [[Zim Integrated Shipping Services]], [[Oil Refineries]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | authors= |authorlink= | title= Eisenberg plans to concentrate in Israel.

At the same time he took advantage of his connections to do militant transactions between the Far East and Israel, and also became an exporter of weapons from Israel to countries in [[Africa]] and [[South America]]. Later on he was the first person to do commercial business between Israel and [[China]]. Eisenberg is considered a significant donor to political parties, influencing the [[Politics of Israel|Israeli politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | authors= Norman Kaplan|authorlink= | title= The Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between Israel and China:| date= | publisher= | url = http://www.calcol.com/history-15.html| work = | pages = | accessdate = March 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Eisenberg founded "[[Beit Asia]]" in [[Tel Aviv]], which he also got special tax-cuts for, where he located his stock market investments' [[Headquarters|headquarter]], owned by Eisenberg’s Group. Jonathan Zohovsky, his daughter’s husband, as well as Michael Albin, who was the manager of the group, assisted him. After the [[1983 Israel bank stock crisis|Israeli 1983 stock market crash]], the group had significant losses, and later on the [[Israel Police|police]] found that the company had been hiding information from its stockholders and Albin was found guilty. He later died in tragic reasons, and Eisenberg disconnected his relationship with his daughter and her husband. In the 1990s, his business activity began to slow down, due to involvement of other markets in the Far East and other factors. Eisenberg died in [[Beijing]] in 1997, two years before the expiration of the Eisenberg Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | authors= Mitch Abrams|authorlink= | title= Israel industrialist Shaul Eisenberg dies| date= June 5, 1997| publisher= | url = http://www.jta.org/news/article/1997/06/05/3930/BIsraelindustrial| work = | pages = | accessdate = March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

Eisenberg's brother, Refael, who was a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] scholar, died in 1976, leaving twelve children behind him.

Silvio Santos worked on the streets of [[Rio de Janeiro]] as a street vendor at the age of 14. During this period, he was invited to work in a radio station, but as he made more money as a street vendor, he left the broadcaster job a month later.

Later he went to São Paulo and after taking several different jobs that included prize raffling, he got a part on a TV show that was a major success. About the same time he bought the company (Baú da Felicidade) and in a short time expanded the leading brand of the group, which would be the starting point for Silvio to become one of the main names of Brazilian media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://exame.abril.com.br/negocios/noticias/45-fatos-sobre-silvio-santos-o-camelo-que-virou-bilionario 45 fatos sobre Silvio Santos, o camelô que virou bilionário]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BR RJANRIO PH 0 FOT 41273 015.tif|thumb|Sílvio Santos in the TV program "First Brazilian Championship of New Singers", 1972. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil.]]]]

==Finances and involvement in politics==

With a net worth of R$3.2 billion (around US$800 million), Silvio Santos is the single biggest individual/natural person taxpayer in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://economia.terra.com.br/noticias/noticia.aspx?idNoticia=201303041456_TRR_82053259 'Forbes': Silvio Santos e Edir Macedo entram em lista de bilionários] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509083717/http://economia.terra.com.br/noticias/noticia.aspx?idNoticia=201303041456_TRR_82053259 |date=2013-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, he started to fight for the rights of having his own television network, as he wanted to expand his prizes raffling.

In 1981, he finally obtained permission to operate what would become TVS, in São Paulo. The TV channel expanded very quickly and became what today is known as SBT (acronym for [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão]], translation: "Brazilian System of Television"), a brand that would be widespread throughout the country by the end of the 80s and early 90s.

Silvio Santos also tried to get involved in politics and even ran for president in 1989.

In 2008, Grupo Silvio Santos completed 50 years and was then formed by 44 companies, with ventures that range from agribusiness to banks and hotels.

==Social impact==

As he comes from a humble background, people tend to identify themselves with him and see him as proof that wealth can be achieved through hard work and persistence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/profile/silvio-santos/# Silvio Santos - Forbes]&lt;/ref&gt; Another point is that, as he was born to immigrant parents, Silvio Santos embodies the concept that Brazilians are a mixture of several different ethnicities.

He is also responsible for providing access to major international TV programming, such as ''[[Celebrity Big Brother]]'', ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', ''[[Candid Camera]]'', ''[[Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?]]'', and ''[[Deal or No Deal]]''.

Instead of just broadcasting these shows – which are mostly on pay TV channels – he created Brazilian versions so that people could not only watch the shows, but also participate in them as contestants buying the products of their sponsors or even other investments.

These shows usually attract middle-class people, as he would raffle money, houses, appliances, cars and even promote family reunions and marriages. However, it did not prevent him from inviting celebrities and politicians who would participate in his shows and donate their prizes to various charities.

His trajectory has led to many comparisons between him and [[Richard Branson|Sir Richard Branson]]. Due to his extremely charismatic personality, Silvio became and is still one of the most influential and loved people in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebrazilbusiness.com/articlebrazilian-businessman-silvio-santos Este é o artigo irá apresentá-lo para Silvio Santos, um dos empresários mais bem sucedidos no Brasil, com foco em sua trajetória, sucesso e papel na televisão brasileira.]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to his peculiar mannerisms, impersonations of him have become a staple of Brazilian humor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8M0QqtsZzY]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQhvIPFYK5w]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3SSHP4T_cs]&lt;/ref&gt;

Santos's other trademark is wearing a full-size [[microphone]] on his chest (although he would eventually abandon this practice in late 2014).

==History==
[[File:New-smart-logo.png|thumb|right|187px|Smart logo (2011–2016)]]

=== Early history ===
Anticipating the liberalization of the telecommunications industry in the Philippines a group of Filipino investors led by Orlando B. Vea and David T. Fernando organized Smart (then named Smart Information Technology, Inc.) on January 24, 1991.

The company obtained its congressional franchise in April 1992 and was granted a provisional authority to operate a mobile cellular service in May 1993. In December 1993, Smart commenced commercial operations of its cellular service.  By then, Smart had drawn in partners. These were: [[First Pacific]], a Hong Kong-based conglomerate through its Philippine flagship [[Metro Pacific Investments Corporation]] and [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone]] of Japan (NTT).

In compliance with the government’s telecommunications program, Smart established a local exchange service in the cities and provinces assigned to it under the “service area scheme.” The Company also obtained licenses to provide international gateway, paging and inter-carrier transmission services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elitefavors.net/2010/06/smart-communication.html |title=About Smart Communication |publisher=elitefavors.net |date=June 14, 2010 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000s ===
On March 24, 2000, PLDT completed its share-swap acquisition of Smart, making Smart a 100%-owned PLDT subsidiary.

=== 2010s ===
On February 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://smart.com.ph/About/meet/innovations-and-awards/the-netphone|title=The Netphone - Smart Communications|website=smart.com.ph|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smart unveiled the [[Netphone 701|Netphone]], its own line of Android-compliant smartphones designed for emerging markets at the [[GSMA]] [[Mobile World Congress]] in [[Barcelona|Barcelona, Spain]]. The Netphone was introduced as the world's first smartphone backed by an operator-managed platform.

On August 25, 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smart.com.ph/About/newsroom/press-releases/2012/08/17/smart-launches-the-philippines-first-commercial-lte-service-on-august-25|title=Smart launches the Philippines’ first commercial LTE service on August 25|website=smart.com.ph|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smart launched the Philippines' first 4G mobile broadband commercial service running on LTE technology. On April 13, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smart.com.ph/About/newsroom/press-releases/2016/04/12/smart-starts-deployment-of-lte-advanced-mobile-service|title=Smart starts deployment of LTE-Advanced mobile service|website=smart.com.ph|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smart introduced the first commercial LTE-A Service in [[Boracay]], [[Aklan]].

On June 13, 2016, Smart and its parent company PLDT unveiled their new logos and identity as part of the company's continuing digital pivot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pldt.com/newscenter/news/2016/06/13/pldt-smart-unveil-new-logo-in-line-with-digital-pivot-|title=PLDT, Smart unveil new logo in line with ‘digital pivot’|publisher=PLDT|date=June 13, 2016|accessdate=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://business.mb.com.ph/2017/02/15/pldt-smart-huawei-seal-5g-partnership|title=PLDT-Smart, Huawei seal 5G partnership|website=Manila Bulletin Business|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smart and parent company PLDT signed a memorandum of understanding with China-based [[Huawei|Huawei Technologies]] "to shape the strategic and commercial development of the 5G ecosystem in the Philippines".

In October 2018, petitioners asked the Supreme Court to stop Globe and Smart from using the 700 Mhz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/business/215390-supreme-court-asked-stop-globe-smart-use-700-mhz|title=SC asked to stop Globe, Smart's use of 700 MHz frequency|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Smart announced that they were working to fix its slow internet service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1047159/smart-network-announces-slow-internet-services|title=Smart network announces slow internet services|first=Cathrine|last=Gonzales|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8692">{{nihongo|'''''Sōkaiya'''''|総会屋|sōkaiya}} (sometimes also translated as ''corporate bouncers'', ''meeting-men'', or ''corporate blackmailers'') are specialized [[racketeer]]s unique to [[Japan]], and often associated with the [[yakuza]], who [[Extortion|extort]] money from or [[blackmail]] companies by threatening to publicly [[Humiliation|humiliate]] companies and their management, usually in their {{nihongo|annual meeting|総会|sōkai}}.

Conversely, if they ''are'' paid, they will work to prevent others from embarrassing the company, either through intimidation or by disrupting the meeting so they cannot be heard.

==History==
Sōkaiya originate from the late 19th century. At this time, the unlimited liability of the management put the managers' personal fortune at risk in case of rumors and scandals. Hence the management hired protection, called sōkaiya, to reduce the risk of such rumors. Even after the Japanese laws included a limited liability, hence reducing the personal risk to the managers, these sōkaiya continued to prosper, and were often used to quiet down otherwise difficult meetings. In that respect, they have even been compared to [[corporate lawyer]]s in America.&lt;ref name = "Sokaya book"&gt;{{cite book |last=Szymkowiak |first=Kenneth |title=Sokaiya: Extortion, Protection, and the Japanese Corporation |year=2002 |publisher=East Gate Book |isbn=978-0-7656-0780-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the law made first steps to reduce the threat from sōkaiya by establishing a minimum number of holdings (¥50,000) in order to be allowed into the shareholder meeting, leading to a slow decline of the number of sōkaiya. In response to this, the sōkaiya formed fake [[uyoku dantai]], announcing embarrassing company secrets, fictional or not, from loudspeakers mounted on trucks in order to extort money from companies.&lt;ref name = "Sokaya book"/&gt;

In 1994, [[Juntarō Suzuki]], vice president of [[Fujifilm]], was murdered by sōkaiya after he stopped paying these bribes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/reviews/Maruko.html Sōkaiya and Japanese Corporations], Eiko Maruko, Electronic Journal of Contemporary Japanese Studies, 25 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

===Disrupting shareholder meetings===
Individuals acquire enough stock from multiple companies in order to gain entrance to a [[shareholders' meeting]]. There, they disrupt the meeting (and embarrass the company) until their demands are met. For this, the sōkaiya often research the company in detail beforehand to uncover incidents of misconduct or other company secrets, and then blackmail the management so that these issues are not raised in the shareholder meeting or elsewhere. Often, they also invent fictional issues that the company would have a difficult time disproving.

Modern sōkaiya have developed other, similar methods to accomplish their goals. One less subtle example is the ''banzai sōkaiya'', who disrupt business places with their cries of "[[Ten thousand years|Banzai]]!" and praise of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] until they are quietly paid to leave.

===Other disruption===
Sōkaiya also form fake groups, announcing embarrassing company secrets, fictional or not, from loudspeakers mounted on trucks in order to extort money from companies.&lt;ref name = "Sokaya book"/&gt; They may also print special newspapers with topics embarrassing to companies, and then ask the company to buy the entire print at inflated prices, or even to subscribe to these newspapers, generating a steady flow of cash.

===Preventing disruption of shareholder meetings===
Sōkaiya have also been used by companies to drown out questions from legitimate shareholders which company officials do not want presented. One infamous case is related to [[Minamata disease]] (mercury poisoning), where the [[Chisso]] chemicals company managed to close a number of annual meetings within minutes even though hundreds of protesters wanted to voice their anger. They have also been active against anti-war protesters and other people who may be viewed as a nuisance by the company at a particular time.

==Countermeasures==
Article 968 of the Japanese corporations code prohibits sōkaiya activity, imposing imprisonment of no more than five years or a fine of no more than ¥5 million for "receiving, demanding or promising a proprietary benefit with regard to" statements or the exercise of voting rights at a shareholder or creditor meeting.

A practical countermeasure used by large corporations is to hold all shareholder meetings on the same day, so sōkaiya cannot disrupt all of them.&lt;ref name = "SameDay meeting"&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

While in the west a shareholders' meeting is usually an earnest discussion between the shareholders and the management, in Japan it is often more of a ceremony, and the management does not feel the need to truly inform shareholders.&lt;ref name = "ceremony only"&gt;{{cite journal
 |date=March 1997

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this atmosphere, the sōkaiya are able to prosper. However, with the trend for more [[deregulation]] in the Japanese market the business environment for sōkaiya is getting more and more difficult.

==Companies that have bribed sōkaiya==
Major companies that have been found guilty of employing sōkaiya include but are not limited to:

'''Trade commissioner''' is the title of a government official whose primary duties are to promote international [[trade agreements]] and [[export]] trade programs on behalf of a national or regional government authority.  Such envoys are normally posted abroad, often being permanently resident in the country or region to which they have been assigned, but in some cases are locally engaged employees.  If assigned by an authority or organization lacking sovereignty, or if a local employee, a trade commissioner may not enjoy diplomatic status. The title Trade Commissioner is also used by some international organizations for the senior official responsible for trade.

'''''Tropico 3''''' is a [[video game]] developed by [[Haemimont Games]] and published by [[Kalypso Media]]. Like the previous games in the series, ''Tropico 3'' is a [[construction and management simulation]] as well as a [[political simulation game]], with emphasis on [[City-building game|city building]]. As a thematic sequel to ''[[Tropico]]''  (unlike the pirate-themed sequel, ''[[Tropico 2]]''), the game attempts to return to the roots of the series, which puts the player into the shoes of "El Presidente" – a dictator governing over an island [[banana republic]].

The [[macOS|OS X]] version of the game was released on January 26, 2012, by [[Feral Interactive]].&lt;ref name="feralinteractive.com"/&gt;

Feral Interactive is bringing a redesigned version of Tropico 3 to iPad in 2018, under the name Tropico&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.idownloadblog.com/2018/07/11/feral-interactive-tropico-ipad-details/|title=Feral Interactive releases new details about upcoming Tropico game for iPad|date=2018-07-11|work=iDownloadBlog.com|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Tropico screenshot.jpg|thumb|300px|Tourist district including an airport, hotels, a zoo, and others.]]

Players begin having seized power of the Caribbean island country of Tropico, where they rule as "El Presidente". The game has a campaign with 15 different missions with varying objectives.

As "El Presidente", the player's main duties include managing development on the island, by ordering construction of various resources, industry and service buildings, and determining how these buildings operate. The player can also issue several different "edicts" to influence the island, such as new laws, policies, and diplomatic actions.

There are seven different political factions on the island (communists, capitalists, militarists, environmentalists, nationalists, religious faction and intellectuals) each with various demands, such as constructing a specific building and issuing a specific edict. Due to the game's Cold War setting, the player will have to manage relations with both the United States and the [[USSR]], who will provide the player with yearly financial aid. Higher relations with a superpower will mean more aid and the possibility of an alliance, low relations will mean less aid and the danger of invasion by that superpower.

Other features include a time line editor that allows you to create your own fictitious historical events or enter real ones, custom avatar, political speeches, wide range of editing and modification functions, mission generator for random map creation, variety of online-functions such as high scores or visiting islands belonging to other players and a Latin soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kalypsomedia.com/en-us/games/Tropico3/index.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718025750/http://www.kalypsomedia.com/en-us/games/Tropico3/index.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-07-18 |title=Where Games Live |publisher=Kalypsomedia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game has a variety of humor elements including running satirical commentary by fictional radio station Tropico News Today, and subtle touches such as liaisons between priests and cabaret girls. The "loading" and "saving" screens have quotes from various dictators, leaders, politicians, and revolutionaries such as [[Che Guevara]], [[Fidel Castro]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Karl Marx]], [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Dwight Eisenhower]], [[Augusto Pinochet]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], [[Todor Zhivkov]], [[Vladimir Putin]], [[Muammar Gaddafi]], and [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]].

===Additions to [[Tropico]]===
*Numerous random world events.
*A transport system allowing citizens to travel by cars.
*[[Customization of Avatars (Computing)|Avatar customization]] and control.
*Election speeches.
*[[Oil production]] is available as an industry for educated workers.
*[[Same-sex marriages]] and [[nuclear testing]] are available as edicts, with different results and requirements.
*New faction: Nationalists, who hate immigration and prefer a dominant Tropican workforce.
*A "vintage mode" for non-rotational 3D visuals.
*Gravel roads (roads with a low speed for countryside of the island)
*Ability to construct a sculpture of El Presidente (the player's [[avatar (computing)|avatar]]) on the island.

==Development==
{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}
''Tropico 3'' was developed by Haemimont Games for both Xbox 360 and PC. Features include a new 3D game engine and a customizable avatar which you can travel across the island, interacting with the environment and population and the use of cars, trucks and limos. Like the original ''Tropico'', the developers preserved the tongue-in-cheek humor of the game, as well as the basic game-play. In ''Tropico 3'', the issues and problems of the island are explained by Juanito the DJ in humorous ways.

==Expansions==
In March 2010, the expansion pack "Absolute Power" was announced, slated for release in Europe in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newgamenetwork.com/news/910/tropico-3-expansion-announced/|title=Tropico 3 Expansion announced|publisher=[[New Game Network]]|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion received an 8/10 on Game Zone, closing with "Absolute Power isn’t a revolution, instead taking the framework laid out by the original game and building on it with new features and a wacky new campaign. The core mechanics are still the same, and the new campaign might be a turn off to sim fans looking for something more grounded and traditional. However, if you were a fan of ''Tropico 3'' and want another reason to step into the role of El Presidente once more, then this is your 
chance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hopper |first=Steven |url=http://pc.gamezone.com/reviews/item/tropico_3_absolute_power_review/ |title=Tropico 3 Absolute Power review &amp;#124; GameZone |publisher=Pc.gamezone.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923111908/http://pc.gamezone.com/reviews/item/tropico_3_absolute_power_review |archivedate=2011-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Absolute Power was released on PC as an expansion pack, and is included in the Macintosh version of the game.

The expansion pack gives the player a wider selection of edicts such as 'Print money', 'Free housing', 'Delete a Faction' and 'Shoot Juanito' (which involves blowing up Juanito's ''TNT Radio''). These new edicts are called 'Megalomania edicts'; for each edict that the player releases they can gain a varying amount of megalomania score that counts at the end of the game. Also there is a new range of buildings, including 'Golden Statue' (in the likeness of 'El Presidente'), 'Garbage dump' and 'Balloon rides'. The Loyalist faction is also introduced; it is composed of the player's most loyal supporters. There is also a second radio DJ named Betty Boom who is head of the resistance movement against el Presidente.

==Editions==

===Steam Special Edition===
The "Steam Special Edition" of ''Tropico 3'' offers two additional maps for the sandbox mode and two additional costumes for the El Presidente avatar editor. The "Steam Special Edition" is only available through [[Steam (software)|Steam]]. It was released on October 21, 2009, in North America but was originally listed to be released on the later date of October 25, 2009. The international release was on November 14, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/23490/ |title=Tropico 3 - Steam Special Edition on Steam |publisher=Store.steampowered.com |date=2009-10-20 |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collector Edition===
The Collector Edition, for which the content has never been revealed, was available to pre-order only on Amazon sites worldwide; however, on September 30, 2009, Amazon announced this collector edition had been canceled. On September 29, 2010, Kalypso released "Tropico 3: Gold Edition," which includes the Tropico 3, the Absolute Power expansion, and an instruction book.

If that doesn’t satisfy the hunger, players are eligible to jump online and download user-created challenges to overcome. With personalities such as Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, ''Tropico 3'' is an educational and entertainment piece that is well-deserving of a few playthroughs by all gamers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=GameZone |url=http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/item/tropico_3_360_review |title=Tropico 3 - 360 - Review |publisher=GameZone |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{orphan|date=November 2018}}
The [[United Airlines]] pilot '''Master Executive Council (MEC)''' of the [[Air Line Pilots Association, International]] (ALPA) is the administrative body that represents over 12,700 United Airlines pilots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180110006080/en/United-Airlines-ALPA-Master-Executive-Council-Reelects|title=United Airlines ALPA Master Executive Council Reelects Captain Todd Insler as Chairman|access-date=2018-09-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council is tasked with advancing and protecting the careers of United pilots, focusing on safety, pay, working conditions, benefits and job security. 

The United MEC consists of member-elected representatives who are selected from the eleven United domiciles throughout the United States and Guam. Local pilot volunteers form the foundation of the committee, and full-time ALPA staff assist the group with legal, administrative, and communications support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alpa.org/ual/about-ual/sub-pages/what-we-do|title=What We Do - ALPA|website=www.alpa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the United pilots' formal [[collective bargaining]] agent under the [[Railway Labor Act]], the MEC is responsible for negotiating pilot contracts and enhancing airline safety and security. The ALPA motto is "Schedule with Safety" and many of the safety features found in current aircraft and airports are the result of United ALPA volunteer initiatives. Their contract, the United Pilot Agreement, establishes work rules and provides for higher pay, making them one of the highest paid pilot groups in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/united-continental-pilots-ok-two-year-contract-extension-1453479463|title=United Continental Pilots Back Two-Year Contract Extension|last=Cameron|first=Doug|date=2016-01-22|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-09-28|last2=Dulaney|first2=Chelsey|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
On July 27, 1931, under the leadership of United Captain Dave Behncke, the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) was created. Captain Dave Behncke served as ALPA's first president, from 1931 until 1951, during which time ALPA became active in Washington, D.C. and worked to secure legislation that made the airline piloting profession safer for both workers and passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wisconsinaviationhalloffame.org/inductees/behncke.htm|title=Wisconsin Aviation Hall of Fame - Inductees|website=www.wisconsinaviationhalloffame.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the United MEC continues its history of involvement on Capitol Hill, along with promoting legislation that benefits pilots, advances airline safety, and enhances security.

== Current Leadership ==
Every two years, the United MEC elects a slate of four officers to serve the pilots of United Airlines as MEC officers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/chicago/news/2018/01/11/united-airlines-pilots-re-electoutspoken-veteran.html|title=United Airlines pilots re-elect outspoken veteran as their union leader|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bizjournals.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Todd Insler, a 21-year veteran of United Airlines, was unanimously reelected in January, 2018 and is serving his second term as chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/united-master-executive-council-elects-captain-insler-chairman-300210247.html|title=United Master Executive Council Elects Captain Insler Chairman|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Insler previously held positions as MEC Grievance Committee chairman and vice chairman.

Captain Tom Murphy, based in San Francisco, serves as vice chairman. Captain Bill Neveu serves as secretary, and Captain Rick Cameron serves as treasurer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Two United pilots were recently elected to high-ranking positions at Air Line Pilots Association, International. Captain Bob Fox was elected first Vice President and Captain Joseph Genovese was elected Vice President - Finance/Treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://atwonline.com/labor/alpa-board-elects-new-president-national-officers|title=ALPA board elects new president, national officers|website=atwonline.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Pinchuk was born in 1960 in Kiev to Jewish parents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2009/10/27/01003-20091027ARTFIG00353-victor-pinchuk-oligarque-philanthrope-.php|title=Victor Pinchuk, oligarque philanthrope |author=Arielle Thédrel|work=Le Figaro|accessdate=26 September 2014|language=fr|date=2009-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jta-report-top-3&gt;{{cite news|author=Cnaan Liphshiz|title=Jews occupy top 3 places on Ukrainian list of philanthropists|url=http://www.jta.org/2013/02/06/news-opinion/world/jews-occupy-top-3-places-on-ukrainian-list-of-philanthropists|accessdate=14 October 2013|newspaper=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency|JTA]]|date=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Bloom|first=Nate|title=Jewish Stars 5/21 |publisher=[[Cleveland Jewish News]]|date=May 21, 2010|url=https://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/archives/jewish-stars/article_8bcbaa8e-2f09-53ac-98ba-cd2207aa8901.html|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who moved to the industrial city of [[Dnipropetrovsk]]. He graduated from [[Dnipropetrovsk Metallurgical Institute]] with a doctorate in industrial engineering in 1987.&lt;ref name="tabmag"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Danilova|first1=Maria|title=In Ukraine, a Jewish Oligarch Is a Bridge to the West|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/155976/ukraines-western-face|website=Tablet Magazine|accessdate=23 November 2016|date=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, he founded the Interpipe Company on the basis of his patented innovations, which were adopted by leading metallurgical factories in the USSR.

Interpipe is a major producer of seamless pipes and railway wheels. In 2004, Pinchuk and [[Rinat Akhmetov]], two of Ukraine's richest men, acquired the [[Kryvorizhstal]] steel factory for about $800 million.&lt;ref name=bargainPinchuk/&gt;  President [[Leonid Kuchma]], who is Pinchuk's father-in-law, authorized the state assent sale, which competitors complained was far below market rate.&lt;ref name=NYT13feb14&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chozick|first1=Amy|authorlink=Amy Chozick|title=Trade Dispute Centers on Ukrainian Executive With Ties to Clintons|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/13/us/politics/trade-dispute-centers-on-ukrainian-executive-with-ties-to-clintons.html|accessdate=11 April 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=13 February 2014|page=A19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, the [[first Tymoshenko government]] reversed this sale, and held a nationally-televised repeat auction that netted $4.8 billion.&lt;ref name=bargainPinchuk&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/business/bus_general/detail/62087/ Monopolies thrive as toothless state bows to moguls], [[Kyiv Post]] (March 18, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Pinchuk founded an investment advisory company, EastOne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EastOne Group Ltd: Company Profile|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/companies/0601244D:LN-eastone-group-ltd|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its portfolio includes industrial assets such as production of pipes and tubes, rail car wheels, specialty steels and alloys, machinery, as well as [[StarLightMedia Group|media]].

Pinchuk was a member of the [[Ukrainian Parliament]] between 1998 and 2006 for [[Labour Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/ukraine/parties.htm#trud Ukraine Political Parties], GlobalSecurity.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kyivpost"&gt;{{cite web|title=Victor Pinchuk: Friend or foe of Ukraine?|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/victor-pinchuk-friend-foe-ukraine.html|website=KyivPost|accessdate=23 November 2016|date=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left politics after he came to the conclusion that Ukraine had reached a level of development when business and politics should be separated.

Pinchuk is a member of the Board of the [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]], of the International Advisory Council of [[Brookings Institution]] and of the Corporate Advisory Board of the Global Business Coalition against HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria. Pinchuk holds a share of VS Energy International Ukraine together with Mikhail Spektor and [[Igor Kolomoisky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forbes.net.ua/business/1358503-mihail-spektor-sdelaem-upor-na-energetiku-gostinichnyj-biznes-i-nedvizhimost-vse-ostalnoe-proda |title=Михаил Спектор: Сделаем упор на энергетику, гостиничный бизнес и недвижимость, все остальное – продадим}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, American steel makers filed a case with the [[United States Department of Commerce]] alleging that [[Interpipe Group]] was illegally dumping steel tubes into the American natural gas market.&lt;ref name=NYT13feb14/&gt;  In November 2013, [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Interpipe because of the dumping accusations and a missed $106 million debt payment.&lt;ref name=NYT13feb14/&gt;

In 2015, Pinchuk brought a $2 billion civil action against fellow [[Ukrainian oligarchs]] [[Ihor Kolomoyskyi]] and [[Gennadiy Bogolyubov]] in the [[High Court of Justice]] in London over the 2004 purchase of a Ukrainian mining company. Allegations made include murder and bribery.&lt;ref name=telegraph-20151204&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/12034304/Ukrainian-oligarchs-clash-in-court-over-2bn-business-deal-amid-claims-of-murder-and-bribery.html |title=Ukrainian oligarchs clash in court over $2bn business deal amid claims of murder and bribery |author=David Barrett |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=4 December 2015 |accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Armitage|first1=Jim|title=Oligarchs at war: Claims of murder among Ukrainian billionaires in High Court case|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/oligarchs-at-war-claims-of-murder-among-ukrainian-billionaires-in-high-court-case-10107612.html|accessdate=30 September 2015|work=The Independent|date=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, an undisclosed out of court settlement was reached just before the trial was due to start.&lt;ref name=guardian-20160122&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/22/ukrainian-oligarchs-settle-mine-dispute-worth-billions-out-of-court |title=Ukrainian oligarchs settle mine dispute worth billions out of court |author=Owen Bowcott, Shaun Walker |newspaper=The Guardian |date=22 January 2016 |accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Pinchuk has supported philanthropic projects in Ukraine. In 2006, he consolidated these activities under the [[Victor Pinchuk Foundation]], which is now considered the largest private Ukrainian philanthropic foundation.&lt;ref name="tabmag" /&gt; Its projects include giving $150,000 to the [[Trump Foundation]] as speaking fee in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/trump-foundation-irs-charitable-funds-self-dealing-231743&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibtimes.com/trump-foundation-tax-returns-ukrainian-oligarch-paid-150000-president-elects-charity-2450284&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/katyasoldak/2014/03/03/ukraines-victor-pinchuk-the-oligarch-in-the-middle-of-the-crisis/#c72b56c72897&lt;/ref&gt; the creation of a network of modern neonatal centres throughout Ukraine, cooperation programs with the [[Clinton Global Initiative]],&lt;ref name="hrc" /&gt; the Elton John AIDS Foundation and the ANTIAIDS Foundation of his wife Olena Pinchuk, the creation of the [[Kyiv School of Economics]], a cooperation with the Aspen Institute, the opening of the first large scale contemporary art centre in Ukraine [[PinchukArtCentre]], the production and promotion of a film with [[Steven Spielberg]] on the Holocaust in Ukraine, and support of local Jewish communities.&lt;ref name="tabmag" /&gt;

In June 2009, Pinchuk organized the [[Paul McCartney]] free concert on [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti|Independence Square]] in [[Kiev]] in front of 500,000 people. As an initiative of the ''Pinchuk Art Center'',&lt;ref name=Art&gt;Carol Vogel, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/08/arts/design/08prize.html?_r=1 New Prize to Honor Artists Under 35], [[The New York Times]] (December 7, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; in December 2009, Pinchuk announced a new $100,000 prize for artists under the age of 35. The ''Future Generation Art Prize'' is awarded every two years and is open to any young artist who applies online.  [[Damien Hirst]], [[Takashi Murakami]], [[Andreas Gursky]] and [[Jeff Koons]], artists whose work Pinchuk collects, serve as mentors to the finalists and the winner.&lt;ref name=Art/&gt;

In February 2013, Pinchuk committed to giving half or more of his fortune during his lifetime and beyond to philanthropic causes, joining the [[Giving Pledge]], a philanthropic initiative founded in 2010 by [[Bill Gates]] and [[Warren Buffett]].

Pinchuk has donated from $10 to $25 million to the [[Clinton Foundation]] between 1994 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chozick|first1=Amy|last2=Eder|first2=Steven|title=Foundation Ties Bedevil Hillary Clinton’s Presidential Campaign|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/us/politics/hillary-clinton-presidential-campaign-charity.html|accessdate=11 April 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=21 August 2016|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Pinchuk hired former Clinton pollster [[Douglas Schoen]] on a $40,000 per month retainer.&lt;ref name=NYT13feb14/&gt;  In 2004, Schoen introduced Pinchuk to [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref name=NYT13feb14/&gt;  Between September 2011 and November 2012, Sochen arraigned nearly a dozen meetings between Pinchuk and senior State Department officials, including [[Melanne Verveer]].&lt;ref name=NYT13feb14/&gt;  Emails released by [[Judicial Watch]] and obtained through [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] requests showed that Pinchuk had been invited to dine at Hillary Clinton's home during her tenure at the State department, despite her spokesman's previous denial that they had met during that time.&lt;ref&gt;Westwood, Sarah.

Its tenants include departments from five academic institutions—[[Wake Forest School of Medicine]], [[Wake Forest University]], [[Forsyth Technical Community College]], [[Winston-Salem State University]], [[University of North Carolina School of the Arts|UNC School of the Arts]]— as well as private businesses and other organizations.

The ability of researchers and scientists to work alongside entrepreneurs furthers a goal of Innovation Quarter to develop new treatments and cures for disease and advances in technology.

==History and Growth==

[[File:Wake Forest Innovations Lab Image.jpg|thumb]]The idea of a research park in Winston-Salem was a community-wide effort that began in the early 1990s in the wake of [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] closing many of its former downtown warehouse and manufacturing buildings. Wake Forest School of Medicine's Department of Physiology and Pharmacology moved into one former Reynolds warehouse in 1993, along with eight researchers from [[Winston-Salem State University]]. Civic committees and discussion led to a master plan being announced in 2002 for what was then called Piedmont Triad Research Park.

The first new building, One Technology Place, opened in 2000, occupied by Targacept Inc., a biopharmaceutical company that was spun out of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco. The company developed drugs to treat nervous system diseases and disorders.

Biotech Place opened in February 2012. The 242,000-square-foot structure is composed of two former Reynolds warehouses that have been renovated into a modern biotech research facility, with custom-designed wet and labs as well as Class A office space. The $100 million project was Winston-Salem's most expensive ever downtown project;&lt;ref name=Downtown&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journalnow.com/business/article_3efcc9f2-d3f7-52be-a565-e51fad10222d.html |title=Wake Forest Biotech Place debuts in downtown Winston-Salem}}&lt;/ref&gt; it houses [[Wake Forest School of Medicine]]'s departments of Physiology and Pharmacology, Biomedical Engineering, and Immunology and Microbiology, as well as the Childress Institute for Pediatric Trauma. Private businesses—Carolina Liquid Chemistries, Allegacy Federal Credit Union, Brioche Doree cafe—also are tenants at Biotech Place.&lt;ref name=Tenants&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.WakeForestInnovationQuarter.com/ |title=Wake Forest Innovation Quarter website}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Piedmont Triad Research Park was renamed in March 2013 as Wake Forest Innovation Quarter in recognition of the shift from biotechnology to a mix of biomedical and material sciences, information technology, and other health and communications fields.&lt;ref name="Profile"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/triad/news/2013/03/11/now-wake-forest-innovation-quarter.html |title=As Wake Forest Innovation Quarter, research park hopes to raise profile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early 2014 saw [https://www.inmar.com Inmar Inc., an information technology company], move into another renovated former R.J. Reynolds building in the Innovation Quarter. [https://www.inmar.com Inmar] relocated 900 employees from other sites in Winston-Salem to its new, state-of-the-art headquarters. The company also announced a partnership with the Division of Public Health Sciences of Wake Forest School of Medicine in which Inmar's digital analytics will be used to help locate and enroll patients for clinical trials conducted by the school. The Division of Public Health Sciences in early 2015 completed a move into the Innovation Quarter, in a building called 525@vine. The 525@vine building is adjacent to Inmar's headquarters. The 525@vine building, a five-story R.J. Reynolds factory built in 1926 and renovated in 2012-13, also houses the School of Medicine's Physician Assistant program, as well as Forsyth Technical Community College’s Emerging Technologies Center, which trains more than 1,200 students annually.&lt;ref name=Inmar&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.journalnow.com/business/business_beat/inmar-marks-downtown-move-with-parade-celebration/article_b8a205a0-b906-11e3-9e89-001a4bcf6878.html?mode=story/html |title=Inmar marks downtown move with parade, celebration|work=Winston-Salem Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news-record.com/business/article_88a41839-33cf-5914-8b29-6294ab57f48b.html|title=525@vine officially opens in downtown research park|last=Daniel|first=Fran|work=Winston-Salem Journal|date=June 13, 2014|accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public-Private Collaboration==

With state and federal funding, and the cooperation of neighboring communities, Innovation Quarter's expansion plan includes private businesses, retail and residential units. Among the work is relocating [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern Railroad]] lines, construction of a new rail bridge and burying [[Duke Energy]] transmission lines. More than $17 million from the City of Winston-Salem and Forsyth County, have helped leverage $350 million in state, federal and private investment at Innovation Quarter.&lt;ref name=Innovation&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journalnow.com/business/business_news/local/article_41064d7e-8a6a-11e2-8655-0019bb30f31a.html |title=Research park renamed Wake Forest Innovation Quarter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wake Forest Innovations==

The renaming of Piedmont Triad Research Park to Wake Forest Innovation Quarter came shortly after Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center created a new operating division, Wake Forest Innovations, to establish and manage new business, partnerships, licenses and start-up companies based on the discoveries, intellectual property and research assets of the medical center and [[Wake Forest University]].

Wake Forest Innovations has separate units that market its scientific business assets-core laboratories, preclinical translational services, for example-to outside partners, while also promoting discovery and innovation and the licensing of technologies.&lt;ref name="Profile" /&gt; Wake Forest Innovation Quarter is another unit within Wake Forest Innovations.

Founded in 1922, '''Western Economic Association International''' (WEAI) is a non-profit academic society dedicated to the encouragement and dissemination of economic research and analysis. WEAI's principal activities include the publishing of two quarterly journals, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/%28ISSN%291465-7295 Economic Inquiry] and [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/%28ISSN%291465-7287 Contemporary Economic Policy], and the staging of a large [http://www.weai.org/AnnualConf Annual Conference] each summer as well as smaller biennial [http://www.weai.org/PacRimConf Pacific Rim Conferences]. [http://www.weai.org/membership.html Membership] includes approximately 1,800 individuals from around the world, and over 40 academic institutions, business firms, and other organizations that share WEAI's educational objectives.

==Purpose==
From WEAI's 2009 Bylaws: "The purposes and objectives for which the Western Economic Association International is formed shall be: (a) the encouragement of economic research and discussion; (b) the encouragement of freedom in economic discussion; and (c) the issuance of publications for the purpose of disseminating knowledge on economic subjects.  The corporation shall take no partisan attitude, nor will it commit its Members to any position on theoretical or practical economic questions."&lt;ref name="bylaws"&gt;[http://www.weai.org/Content/Files/2009_Bylaws.pdf WEAI Bylaws], 2009 revision.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journals==

===Economic Inquiry===
Published since 1962, (formerly Western Economic Journal), EI is widely regarded as one of the top scholarly journals in its field.&lt;ref name="digital impact factors"&gt;[http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/DigitalJournalRankings2011.pdf Fullbrook, E. (2011), Digital Impact Factors and Rankings of English Economics Journals 2011.

Twenty-one Nobel Laureates are among Economic Inquiry's long list of prestigious authors. EI was one of the first journals to publish humor papers (now called Miscellany) with the still highly downloaded article "Life Among the Econ" by [[Axel Leijonhufvud]],&lt;ref name="life"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1465-7295.1973.tb01065.x | volume=11 | title=LIFE AMONG THE ECON* | year=1973 | journal=Economic Inquiry | pages=327–337 | last1 = Leijonhufvud | first1 = Axel}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recently "The Theory of Interstellar Trade: by [[Paul Krugman]].&lt;ref name="trade"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1465-7295.2009.00225.x | volume=48 | title=THE THEORY OF INTERSTELLAR TRADE | year=2010 | journal=Economic Inquiry | pages=1119–1123 | last1 = Krugman | first1 = Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, then editor [[Preston McAfee|R.

Published in cooperation with [[Wiley-Blackwell]], EI's worldwide circulation is approximately 4,200. Wesley W. Wilson, University of Oregon, is the current editor.

===Contemporary Economic Policy===
First published in 1982 as Contemporary Policy Issues, Contemporary Economic Policy publishes scholarly economic research and analysis on issues of vital concern to business, government, and other decision makers. Leading scholars, including four Nobel Laureates, are among CEP's authors. The objectives are to communicate results of high quality economic analysis to policymakers, focus high quality research and analysis on current policy issues of widespread concern, increase knowledge among economists of features of the economy key to understanding the impact of policy, and to advance methods of policy analysis. CEP aims to publish articles that will be widely read and cited, and economic analyses with an impact on policy choices, rather than papers that fill a narrow niche or are of parochial interest. CEP publishes economic analysis of policy issues, methods and results for policy analysis, and surveys. Published in cooperation with [[Wiley-Blackwell]], CEP's worldwide circulation is approximately 3,900. Brad Humphreys, University of Alberta, is the current editor.

==Conferences==

===Annual Conferences===
Held each summer between mid-June and mid-July, WEAI Annual Conferences provide the opportunity for more than 1,000 economists from around the world to meet and exchange ideas. An average of 300 concurrent sessions are held with participants presenting individual research papers, serving as discussants for papers, chairing sessions, and also organizing entire sessions on the topics of their choice. Other academic societies with similar objectives to WEAI participate as Allied Societies regularly holding sessions and sometimes their own annual meetings&lt;ref name="NAASE bylaws"&gt;[http://byuresearch.org/NAASE/bylaws.pdf NAASE Bylaws], Article IV, Section 3.&lt;/ref&gt; in conjunction with WEAI conferences. Conference highlights include the Annual WEAI Presidential Address as well as the Association's newest member-sponsored program, the Graduate Student Dissertation Workshop.

===Pacific Rim Conferences===
Held since 1994 in cities like Hong Kong, Taipei, Bangkok, Sydney, Beijing, Kyoto, Brisbane, and Tokyo, the biennial Pacific Rim Conferences have become a highly successful marketplace of ideas for economists from around the world. Partnerships have been established in the organizing of these conferences with universities and organizations such as [[Brisbane Graduate School of Business|Queensland University of Technology School of Business]], [[Ryukoku University]], [[Guanghua School of Management]] Peking University, [[Academia Sinica]], and [[Hong Kong Economic Association]]. A smaller format than the Annual Conference, the Pacific Rim Conference program generally consists of 80 to 100 sessions including 250 to 300 economists serving as paper presenters, discussants, chairs, and session organizers. Keynote speakers include Nobel Laureates such as [[James Heckman]], [[Ken arrow|Ken Arrow]], and [[Robert Engle]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29641">'''Clem Whitaker and Leone Baxter''' were a husband-and-wife team that started '''Campaigns, Inc.''', the first [[political consulting]] firm in the United States. Based in [[California]], the firm worked on a variety of political issues, mostly for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidates. They both supported conservative ideals and are perhaps most famously known for preventing socialist [[Upton Sinclair]] from being elected Governor of California in the [[California gubernatorial election, 1934|1934 election]]. Together, they developed strategies and tactics - such as [[Campaign advertising|media advertisement buys]] and [[Advertising mail|direct-mail campaigns]] - that are still widely used in today's campaigns. Their [[public relations]] work not only revolutionized politics in the modern era, but also deeply impacted political issues that remain relevant today.

==Backgrounds==

===Clem Whitaker===
Clem Whitaker was born in [[Tempe, Arizona]], on May 1, 1899, the son of a [[Baptists|Baptist]] minister. He was raised in [[Willits, California]], where he submitted his first news story, for the ''[[Willits News]]'', at age 13. He began working for the ''[[Sacramento Union]]'' at age 18.

Following a brief stint in the [[United States Army|Army]] during [[World War I]], Whitaker became city editor for the Union before moving to the Sacramento Examiner at age 21.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; He was a political writer for the Examiner until 1921, when he founded the Capitol News Bureau.&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt; His company disseminated political news to eighty newspapers statewide. While living in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], he married Harriet Reynolds. The couple had four children: Clem Jr., Milton, Patricia and Burdett.

===Leone Baxter===
Much less is known about Leone Baxter than Whitaker. Baxter's [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] application lists her birthdate as November 20, 1906, in [[Kelso, Washington]].&lt;ref name=OAC /&gt; She briefly wrote for the [[Portland Oregonian]]. However, after becoming a widow at age 28, she moved to [[Redding, California|Redding]], California. There she found work promoting a water carnival for the Chamber of Commerce. Baxter became the Chamber manager in 1929.

==Origin of the firm==

===Lobbying===
After selling his business to [[United Press International|United Press]] in 1930, a barber friend whose [[trade association]] was having trouble lobbying the state legislature caught Whitaker's attention. For $4,000, Whitaker organized the barbers into a potent [[lobbying]] group, leading to legislation creating the State Board of Barber Examiners.&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt;

In 1933, the [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] (PG&amp;E) lobbied to place Proposition 1 on the ballot for California's December 1933 special election.&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt; This measure was aimed at striking down recent legislation that would establish the [[Central Valley Project]] (CVP). The CVP was to be the nation's largest water irrigation project, supported by the [[Progressivism|progressivists]] who believed in non-privatized power. While PG&amp;E wanted to pass Proposition 1 to defeat the CVP, lawyer [[Sheridan Downey]] was forming a team to help defeat Proposition 1.

===Becoming Campaigns, Inc.===
Whitaker's lobbying efforts for the barbers' trade union attracted Downey, who hired him to help on the campaign. Knowing that the nearby City of [[Redding, California|Redding]] would also have economic interests in protecting the Central Valley Project, Downey recruited Baxter, the city's Chamber of Commerce manager, to help with his undertaking. Downey paired Whitaker and Baxter together on the project. Whitaker and Baxter's efforts helped defeat the measure by 33,000 votes.&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt;

This partnership led to the formation of their campaign management firm, Campaigns, Inc., in 1933. In 1935, Whitaker separated from his then wife, Harriet Reynolds. In 1938, after being in business together for five years, Whitaker and  Baxter married. Their business, called Campaigns Inc., was not formally incorporated until 1950, under the name Whitaker &amp; Baxter, Inc.&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt; The business became known as the first public relations firm in the country dedicated solely to politics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?verb=sr&amp;csi=11053&amp;sr=HEADLINE(Clem+Whitaker+and+Leone+Baxter)%252BAND%252BDATE%252BIS%252B1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next 25 years, the firm handled over 75 campaigns and initiatives, spanning topics such as taxation and finance, pensions, and legislative reapportionment, as well as teacher's salaries and railroad crew issues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Clients who utilized Campaigns, Inc. were also entitled to many of the other enterprises that Whitaker and Baxter pursued, including the Clem Whitaker Advertising Agency, Whitaker-Baxter Public Relations, and an editorial and news syndicate that sent prepared materials to publishers throughout California.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Whitaker and Baxter eventually named Whitaker's son, Clem, Jr. and James J. Dorais as junior partners in the firm.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4d_8AQAAQBAJ|title=The Unseen Power: Public Relations: A History|last=Cutlip|first=Scott M.|date=2013-11-05|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136689994|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These four formed the core staff, along with several other staff members. In 1959, when Clem, Sr.’s health began to plague him in 1959, and Whitaker and Baxter sold the firm to Clem, Jr., James Dorais, and Newton Stearns. The two original founders then formed Whitaker and Baxter International, after which Whitaker passed away in 1961 and from which Baxter retired in the early 1980s. Clem, Jr. wrote in a letter on October 31, 1991, “Years ago when I assumed management of Whitaker and Baxter we phased out of the campaign management business. Our last candidate campaign was the election of Senator Robert Griffin over Governor Mennen “Soapy” Williams in Michigan in 1966. We ceased ballot issue campaigns in 1973.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Whitaker and Baxter remained a consulting firm in the area of public affairs representing energy clients, maintaining offices in San Francisco and Washington, D.C. as a public affairs lobbying group.

==Career highlights==

===George Hatfield for Lieutenant Governor===
Campaigns Inc. was retained for their first official political campaign in 1934.&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt; [[George Hatfield]], a prominent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] who served as [[United States Attorney for the Northern District of California|U.S. Attorney for California's Northern District]], was running for [[Lieutenant Governor of California]] against [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Sheridan Downey]], who had first introduced the pair of political consultants. For Hatfield's election, Whitaker &amp; Baxter's company records from this campaign included many speeches and advertisements they produced. They also analyzed polling data to determine if their message was affecting voters. Ultimately, Hatfield would go on to win the election.

===Frank Merriam for Governor===
In 1934, Whitaker &amp; Baxter were hired by the client who would ultimately put them on the map. [[Frank Merriam]], California's former lieutenant governor who had been volleyed to the [[Governor of California|gubernatorial]] seat following the mid-term death of [[James Rolph]], was running for re-election as governor. Merriam, who assumed the governor's office in June 1934, had immediately faced a union crisis. The [[International Longshoremen's Association]] was [[1934 West Coast waterfront strike|striking]], effectively shutting down the ports in [[San Francisco]]. When police attempted to escort [[Strikebreaker|temporary workers]] to the docks, they became engaged in skirmishes with the strikers. Fearing political ruin if he sent the [[California National Guard|Guard]] in to subdue the strikers, Merriam is rumored to have worked a deal with state Republicans to the party's gubernatorial nominee in exchange for the deployment. Ultimately, both federal and state troops were able to handle the situation, and Merriam was able to blame the ordeal on the political Left.

Merriam's main opponent in the [[California gubernatorial election, 1934|gubernatorial election]] would be [[Upton Sinclair]], author of [[The Jungle]]. A known [[Socialism|Socialist]], Sinclair had been able to win a surprise victory in the [[Primary election|primary]] due to his [[End Poverty in California movement|EPIC]] Project, which stood for "End Poverty in California." The EPIC plan included government work programs and cooperatives. When Whitaker and Baxter were hired, they were told explicitly their main responsibility was, "Keep [Sinclair] from becoming Governor".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/09/24/the-lie-factory|title=The New Yorker|last=Lepore|first=Jill|date=24 September 2012|website=The New Yorker|publisher=Condé Nast|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agenda is especially significant because of the subsequent, direct-offensive strategy employed by Campaigns, Inc. was unheard of at the time. 
In their first major election, Whitaker and Baxter were able to lead Merriam to a victory over Sinclair, 48% to 37%, with a third party candidate taking 13%. [[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.|Arthur Schlesinger]] called this the first all out public relations Blitzkrieg in American Politics, while [[Sidney Blumenthal]] considered it a landmark in the development of the political consultant.&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt; For the time, their work was groundbreaking. However, the tactics they used to attack Sinclair are still a widely used campaign strategy today.

====Strategies against Sinclair====
Prior to the election, Sinclair was a renowned writer. ''I, Governor of California, and How I Ended Poverty'' was a work of Sinclair's set in the future. The basic scenario of the book was that Sinclair had been elected governor, and his EPIC plan had succeeded in one-hundred percent employment for California. However, his other writings did not help him achieve these lofty goals. Using [[Opposition research|oppositional research]] tactics, Whitaker and Baxter pored through all of Sinclair's writings, finding quotes that they could use against him. The [[Los Angeles Times]] began putting quotes from Sinclair on their front page six weeks before the election. Sinclair ultimately attributed his loss to Whitaker &amp; Baxter, who were named only as "The Lie Factory" in his post-election book, "I, Candidate for Governor, and How I Got Licked."&lt;ref name=Lepore /&gt;

For their part, Whitaker and Baxter's oppositional research was not entirely factual. The following quote, which appeared in the L.A. Times reflecting Sinclair's opinion on marriage, was taken from a fictional character's dialogue in Sinclair's book [[Love's Pilgrimage (novel)|Love's Pilgrimage]]. &lt;blockquote&gt;"The sanctity of marriage. . . . I have had such a belief . . . I have it no longer."&lt;ref name="Sinclair"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, Whitaker believed that any quotes which could be attributed to his campaign were fair to use against him. In short, Whitaker believe Upton was beaten because he had written books.&lt;ref name=OAC /&gt;

=====California League Against Sinclairism=====
Aside from oppositional research, Whitaker and Baxter used a variety of other tactics against Sinclair. They decided to organize a [[bipartisanship|bipartisan]] front group known as the California League Against Sinclairism.&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt; Whitaker and Baxter used this group to disseminate information regarding Sinclair's "socialist agenda."&lt;ref name=Lepore /&gt;

=====Media=====
Additionally, media was a key part of the Whitaker and Baxter campaign strategy. They believed in the extensive scripting of candidate's to keep them on message in the media, rather than allowing ragtag bands of volunteers to handle [[Personal branding|branding]] their candidate. They pursued [[earned media]], meaning that they encourage candidates like Merriam to create news rather than simply sending in [[press release]]s. The team would go so far as to trade paid advertising for editorial space. However, if news could not be legitimately created, Whitaker and Baxter believed in creating the perception of news. Whitaker and Baxter teamed up with media tycoon [[Louis B. Mayer]] to promote Frank Merriam in an advertisement.&lt;ref name="Kelsey"/&gt; The ad was meant to look like the [[newsreel]]s of the day, although the true purpose is to create the perception that people who support Sinclar are pro-[[Communism]] and Socialism. Whitaker and Baxter considered this type of advertisement to be effective as it was often perceived as earned media.

=== Healthcare reform ===
During his [[New Deal]] era, [[Franklin Roosevelt]] called for major [[Healthcare reform#United States|healthcare reform]] in the form of government-[[Subsidy|subsidized]] medicine.&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt; In 1945, President [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]] took up this fight, calling on Congress to overhaul the country's healthcare system. [[The American Medical Association]] began to lobby against the president's proposal. In 1949, they retained Whitaker &amp; Baxter to help them with their efforts. The AMA paid Whitaker &amp; Baxter $350,000 to defeat Truman's healthcare plan.&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt; In their usual style, Whitaker &amp; Baxter began an all out media war against the healthcare plan, distributing over 100 million pieces of literature. In just two weeks of the campaign, Whitaker &amp; Baxter was given a $100,000 retainer and over $1 million to spend on advertising, which is a $956,000 retainer and $9.5 million budget&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/how_the_phantom_of_socialized.php|title=How the phantom of 'socialized medicine' came to be|website=Columbia Journalism Review|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; in today's dollars. They spent $1.1 million in advertising on behalf of the AMA. As part of their messaging, they began calling the president's healthcare plan "[[socialized medicine]],"&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt; ushering in the same negative connotations and allusions to communism that they had brought upon Sinclair.

====Branding reform====
President Truman was quick to defend his plan. The plan included federal funding to attract doctors to rural areas, give funding to rural areas to build new hospitals, federal standards for hospitals and health centers to be implemented by a board of doctors and public officials, and the creation of a national health insurance fund to be managed by the federal government.&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt;
Unfortunately for Truman, the term "socialized medicine" stuck. In 1961, [[Ronald Reagan]] would continue using the phrase in his LP [[Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine]], released on behalf of the AMA. The term would fuel the so-called [[Operation Coffee Cup|Operation Coffeecup]] of the 1960s, in which doctors' wives would invite friends over and speak to them about the evils of "socialized medicine," after which they would encourage them to write to their congressmen about the issue.

Ultimately, it would take the American Medical Association over 3 years and $5 million, which would equate to nearly $40 million by today's standards. After the onset of the [[Korean War]], Congress and the president no longer had time to fight lobbying efforts against the measure, resulting in the legislation failing to pass.

===End of the firm===
In the late 1950s, Whitaker and Baxter had a falling out with then client Governor [[Goodwin Knight]]. While Knight had hired the duo for several of his earlier campaigns, he did not bring them back on for his run for the [[Senate of the United States|Senate]] in 1958.&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt; Because of this and Whitaker's failing health, the company began to fade from the political scene. Later in 1958, Whitaker and Baxter sold their company to Clem Whitaker Jr., who would later redirect the focus of their business operations into corporate public relations. The duo formed Whitaker and Baxter International, a smaller public relations consulting firm, which they would run from a San Francisco hotel room. In 1961, Whitaker died of [[emphysema]]. Baxter continued running Whitaker and Baxter International after her husband's death. In 2001, she died in Sacramento at the age of 96.

==Strategy==

===Inner workings of Campaigns, Inc.===
Generally, Whitaker and Baxter worked on political and policy questions, though they also aided firms with corporate [[public relations]], such as improving the image of [[cottonseed oil]] or imitation [[ice cream]].  Their political clientele was mostly Republicans of the 1940s and 1950s, including Governor [[Earl Warren]], Governor [[Goodwin Knight]], and [[Dwight Eisenhower]]'s California [[President of the United States|President]]ial campaign.  Though Whitaker and Baxter ostensibly helped all those who approached their firm, in practice they were committed to small-government [[conservatism]] and forestalling or rolling back the [[New Deal]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}  One of their most influential campaigns was helping the [[American Medical Association]] fight off the [[Fair Deal#Health|national health insurance plans]] of [[Franklin Roosevelt]] and [[Harry Truman]].&lt;ref name=Lepore /&gt;  Though unmentioned in the film, much of the archival anti-national health care [[propaganda]] seen in [[Michael Moore]]'s ''[[Sicko]]'', including Ronald Reagan's [[Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine|phonograph speech]] on how national health care is the first step towards socialism, was produced in 1949 under the direction of Whitaker and Baxter.&lt;ref name=Lepore /&gt;

Whitaker and Baxter directed and framed messages to the public in a completely new way. They understood the average American voter to be most receptive to simple, repetitive, and easy-to-read messages. They simplified issues relevant to the campaign at hand and disseminated their message through mass media outlets. One of their main principles was, "Never explain anything",&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; because the more details provided to the public make support far more difficult to receive.

===Precepts===
Whitaker and Baxter developed several precepts to justify their tactics with Campaigns, Inc. They included adages such as:&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt;

1.     “Never wage a campaign defensively! The only successful defense is a spectacular, hard-hitting, crushing offensive. You can't wage a defensive campaign and win.”

2.     “Attempt to create actual news instead of merely sending out publicity.”

3.     “More Americans like corn than caviar.”

4.     “The average American doesn’t want to be educated; he doesn’t want to improve his mind; he doesn’t even want to work, consciously, at being a good citizen. [But] most every American likes to be entertained. He likes the movies; he likes the mysteries; he likes the fireworks and parades…so if you can’t fight, put on a show!”

5.    "The more you have to explain, the more difficult it is to win support."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Tactics===
Unlike the parties of the day, Whitaker and Baxter could and insisted on emphasizing pace, control, and rhythm in a campaign.They did not trust enthusiastic local volunteers to run an effective campaign, and thus made judgments for themselves on how to allocate resources, relying also on their employed Field Men to check up on district offices.

They were not above [[dirty trick]]s, as seen in their work for the 1934 re-election campaign of Governor [[Frank Merriam]] in his push to defeat social reformer [[Upton Sinclair]].  The major thrust of their work was a [[smear campaign]] against Sinclair, alleging in newspaper stories that he seduced young girls, and placing film reels that depicted Sinclair's supporters as [[socialism|socialist]] pro-Soviets.

====Fundraising====
Whitaker and Baxter also specialized in fundraising, and maintained a massive web of operations throughout California, representing a range of industries, ethnic groups, and special interests.  They developed early models of campaign finance and expenditure, including spending money early to drive out challengers (as in Goodwin Knight's [[California gubernatorial election, 1954|1954 gubernatorial campaign]]) or holding as much as 75% of their total funds to the end of the campaign (typically, the last three weeks), when voters were paying attention.&lt;ref name=Mitchell /&gt;

====California Features Service====
In addition to the core of Campaigns Inc., Whitaker and Baxter had two side businesses which helped them satisfy their client's needs. Clem Whitaker Advertising Agency was the advertising arm of Campaigns Inc. With this, Whitaker would plan and design all advertising efforts for his clients in accordance with the campaign strategy he developed with Campaigns Inc. The California Feature Service was a newspaper wire service which delivered articles and editorials to about 300 local newspapers in California. Whitaker and Baxter would create these releases to mimic editorial copy. Editors looking for quick content to fill their papers often would not notice that the copy was from an advertising service.&lt;ref name=OAC /&gt;

==Contributions to Public Relations==
Whitaker and Baxter made many lasting contributions to the field of public relations. Firstly, they developed the political consulting into what we know it today. They are responsible for professionalizing political public relations by developing the first organization whose purpose was solely political campaigning. Campaigns, Inc. was formed in 1930, after the landscape of the political marketing industry as a whole&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1811/29455|title=Citizens as Legislators: Direct Democracy in the United States|author1=Shaun Bowler |author2=Todd Donovan |author3=Caroline J. Tolbert |publisher=The Ohio State University Press|year=1998|isbn=0814207774|location=|pages=58, 59, 60, 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; was experiencing changes and developments throughout the 1920s. These changes came from the overall development of commercial mass marketing in the beginning of the century.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Whitaker and Baxter dominated the field for years without competition, and have a track record of winning seventy out of seventy five campaigns between 1933 and 1955.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Campaigns Inc. is responsible for shaping many macro-level features of political public relations that remain relevant today. They were the first organization to comprehensively be in control of all aspects of a campaign for both individuals and for larger organizations "interested in constitutional amendments or other issues".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This was significant not only in what it meant for the world of PR and political campaigning, but further what it meant for the political landscape of the United States as a whole. In 1936, [[V. O. Key, Jr.|V.O. Key]] analyzed the changes made by Campaigns Inc. and understood it to be a change from "personal politics of the precinct variety toward a reliance on mass propaganda techniques".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

More specifically, they revolutionized the PR media tactics of the day, putting a heavy emphasis on television and radio advertising rather than simple word of mouth or [[grassroots]] efforts. Additionally, they relied heavily on direct mail campaigns, which are still popular to this day, in a way no other organization had thought to so before. In doing this, Whitaker and Baxter ensured the full service campaign management became the norm for political campaigns, from presidential campaigns all the way down to state house and more local races.

Money and advertising, which were not considered essential before Campaigns Inc.,&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt; are still thought of as major aspects of today's campaigns. Where the [[political boss]]es of the day used throw their weight with bribes or incentives to attract voters, political consultants are able to carefully craft a message that both attracts voters and makes careful use of a candidate's budget. Because of their expertise, political consultants have now become the norm for campaigns, and the quality of a political consultant can make or break even a well-qualified candidate. In this way, political consultants replaced [[party boss]]es as the power holders in politics. This idea is still seen very much in today's political landscape.

Campaigns, Inc. and the work of Whitaker and Baxter is not without criticism. The "excessive professionalization"&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; of the campaign industry is thought by some to be harmful to the democratic process, especially after their work for the AMA with "socialized medicine". The idea of ethics in public relations became extremely important, and is still debated and questioned in today's world. Whitaker and Baxter showed for the first time the magnitude of power that strategic political communication can have over public opinion.

The legacy of Whitaker and Baxter has affected the political issues that we still consider salient. [[Health care reform debate in the United States|Healthcare reform]] today is still largely framed using the [[Socialized medicine|terminology]] introduced by Whitaker and Baxter. This political team was able to use effective advertising and messaging to not only halt the progress of healthcare reform for their client, but to hasten this process so much that it is still being debated today.

[[Theodore H. White|Theodore White]], the famous American journalist and novelist, made the following remarks about the legacy of Whitaker and Baxter: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Clem Whitaker and Leone Baxter are now gone, but their kind of politics, professional image-making, has not only persisted, but thrived; and, in thriving, swept East, where politics industry has grown up—a gathering of professionals who merchandise control of voter reactions.”&lt;ref&gt;White, Theodore H. Breach of Faith: The Fall of Richard Nixon. New York: Atheneum, 1975. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
