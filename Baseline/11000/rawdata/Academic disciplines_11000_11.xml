[[File:AHHAA.jpg|thumb|AHHAA]]
'''Science Centre AHHAA''' is the biggest [[science centre]] in [[Estonia]] and the [[Baltic states]], located in [[Tartu]]. The main purpose of AHHAA is promoting [[science]], [[technology]] and the scientific approach to solve common disadvantages.

Since 7 May 2011, Science Centre AHHAA has been located in a building in the centre of Tartu.

==History==
AHHAA was established as a project of the [[University of Tartu]] on 1 September 1997 and by 2004 it had developed into a [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]] constituted by the city of Tartu and the University of Tartu.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ahhaa.ee/about-us&lt;/ref&gt; From the very beginning, the head of Science Centre AHHAA was [[Tiiu Sild]]. In 2008, the AHHAA [[4D film|4D Adventure Cinema]] was opened in the Lõunakeskus [[shopping centre]] in Tartu. In 2009, a [[branch office]] of Science Centre AHHAA was opened in [[Tallinn]] at the [[Freedom Square, Tallinn|Freedom Square]] (the Tallinn branch was closed at the end of 2013). On 7 May 2011 Science Centre AHHAA in Tartu opened the doors of its new, 11,156 m² building engineered by [[architects]] [[Vilen Künnapu]] and [[Ain Padrik]] in the heart of the city.

The activities of the Science Centre AHHAA Foundation are coordinated by a [[committee]] composed of Hannes Astok, Anneli Saro, Jaanus Karv, Mart Laidmets, Reno Laidre and Vallo Mulk.

Additionally, the practical aspects of the activities of the foundation are appraised by a science committee composed of experts.

==Planetarium==
Science Centre AHHAA offers a view of the starry skies in a fully spherical hybrid planetarium (which means that there is a possibility to show the skies with both [[optical]] and [[Digital cinema|digital projection]], which can be displayed either separately or together).

===Constructional and technical side===
The uniqueness of AHHAA's planetarium lies in the fact that in addition to the ordinary view on the ceiling and the walls, the image of the skies in the planetarium of the centre also extends under the floor, which is the reason why the [[glass floor|floor of the planetarium is made of glass]].&lt;ref name=Aru&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aru|first1=Margus|title=Under One Dome: AHHAA Science Centre Planetarium|journal=Planetarian: Journal of the International Planetarium Society|date=March–June 2012|volume=41|issue=2|page=57|url=http://issuu.com/planetarian/docs/june2012smaller|accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General===
*9 meters in diameter
*20+5 seats
*The first planetarium in Europe to use the MEGASTAR projector
*Currently the first and the only hybrid-planetarium (multiple projector system) in the Baltic states

The AHHAA Planetarium belongs to two organisations:
*The Nordic Planetarium Association
*The International Planetarium Society

==4D Adventure Cinema==
Science Centre AHHAA had a 4D Adventure Cinema, located in the Lõunakeskus shopping centre on the southern edge of Tartu. The cinema was open from 18.07.2008 to 31.12.2017&lt;ref&gt;https://en.astri.ee/lounakeskus/ahhaa-4d-elamuskino/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mullitorn.jpg|thumb]]

==Events==
The Science Centre AHHAA Foundation regularly organizes special events. Some of the most reputable events are listed below:

*The annual Researchers' Night [[Science festival|Festival]] – organized all over Estonia in the end of September and consisting of different events promoting a scientific approach to matters (such as Science Cafés, science theatre shows, tours in laboratories, workshops etc.).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teadlasteoo.ee/en&lt;/ref&gt;

==International representation==
The Science Centre AHHAA Foundation participates in science festivals and fairs both in Estonia and abroad, its main “trade tricks” being the science theatre shows and various workshops. During the past few years [[Festival della Scienza]] and Perugia Science Fest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perugiasciencefest.eu/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126121115/http://www.perugiasciencefest.eu/ |archivedate=2012-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Italy]], Korea Science Festival&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kofac.re.kr/en/index.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; in [[South Korea]], Moscow Science Festival&lt;ref&gt;http://www.festivalnauki.ru/&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Russia]], [[Science Picnic]] in [[Poland]] and Science Festival Belgrade&lt;ref&gt;http://www.festivalnauke.org/index-en.html&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Serbia]] have been among the few places where Science Centre AHHAA has been represented.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:air_source_heat_pump_principle.jpg|200px|thumb|A visual representation of the air source heat pump principle|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Wednesday, 23 January 2008|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;

An '''air source [[heat pump]]''' (ASHP) is a system which transfers heat from outside to inside a building, or vice versa. Under the principles of [[vapor compression refrigeration]], an ASHP uses a [[refrigerant]] system involving a compressor and a condenser to absorb heat at one place and release it at another. They can be used as a space heater or cooler, and are sometimes called "reverse-cycle air conditioners".

In domestic heating use, an ASHP absorbs heat from outside air and releases it inside the building, as hot air, hot water-filled radiators, underfloor heating and/or domestic hot water supply. The same system can often do the reverse in summer, cooling the inside of the house. When correctly specified, an ASHP can offer a full central heating solution and domestic hot water up to 80&amp;nbsp;°C.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Description==
[[Air]] at any temperature above [[absolute zero]] contains some energy. An air-source heat pump transfers ('pumps') some of this energy as heat from one place to another, for example between the outside and inside of a building. This can provide space heating and/or hot water. A single system can be designed to transfer heat in either direction, to heat or cool the interior of the building in winter and summer respectively. For simplicity, the description below focuses on use for interior heating.

The technology is similar to a refrigerator or freezer or air conditioning unit: the different effect is due to the physical location of the different system components. Just as the pipes on the back of a refrigerator become warm as the interior cools, so an ASHP warms the inside of a building whilst cooling the outside air.

The main components of an air-source heat pump are:
* An outdoor heat exchanger coil, which extracts heat from ambient air
* An indoor heat exchanger coil, which transfers the heat into hot air ducts, an indoor heating system such as water-filled radiators or  underfloor circuits and/or a domestic hot water tank

Air source heat pumps can provide fairly low cost space heating. A high efficiency heat pump can provide up to four times as much heat as an electric heater using the same energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homebuilding.co.uk/2012/05/09/heat-pumps-the-real-cost/ Heat Pumps: The Real Cost]&lt;/ref&gt;  In comparison to gas as a primary heat source, however, the lifetime cost of an air source heat pump may be affected by the price of electricity compared to gas (where available). Use of gas may be associated with higher carbon emissions, depending upon how the electricity is generated.

A "standard" domestic air source heat pump can extract useful heat down to about {{convert|-15|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air source heat pumps / Choosing a renewable technology |url=http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Generating-energy/Choosing-a-renewable-technology/Air-source-heat-pumps}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}--&gt; At colder outdoor temperatures the heat pump is less efficient; it could be switched off and the premises heated using only supplemental heat (or emergency heat) if the supplemental heating system is large enough. There are specially designed heat pumps that, while giving up some performance in cooling mode, will provide useful heat extraction to even lower outdoor temperatures.

==In cold climates==
An air source heat pump designed specifically for very cold climates can extract useful heat from ambient air as cold −30&amp;nbsp;°C (−22&amp;nbsp;°F). Manufacturers include Mitsubishi and Fujitsu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are Air Source Heat Pumps A Threat To Geothermal Heat Pump Suppliers?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomkonrad/2014/01/15/are-air-source-heat-pumps-a-threat-to-geothermal-heat-pump-suppliers/|publisher=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Mitsubishi model provides heat at −35&amp;nbsp;°C, but the [[Coefficient of performance]] (COP) drops to 0.9, indicating that resistance heating would be more efficient at that temperature. At −30&amp;nbsp;°C, the COP is 1.1, according to the manufacturer's data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mitsubishi ZUBA Cold Climate Air Source Heat Pumps |url=http://encore-geothermal.ca/sustainable-solutions/air-source-heat-pumps/ |publisher=Encore Heating and Cooling, Kanata, Ontario |accessdate=15 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021195035/http://encore-geothermal.ca/sustainable-solutions/air-source-heat-pumps/ |archivedate=21 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the manufacturer's marketing literature also claims a minimum COP of 1.4 and performance to −30&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zuba-Central|url=http://www.mitsubishielectric.ca/en/hvac/PDF/zuba-central/Zuba-Central_Catalogue.pdf|publisher=Mitsubishi Electric|accessdate=15 October 2014|page=5|quote=Zuba-Central’s COP ranges from 1.4 to 3.19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731072149/http://mitsubishielectric.ca/en/hvac/PDF/zuba-central/Zuba-Central_Catalogue.pdf|archivedate=31 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although air source heat pumps are less efficient than well-installed [[ground source heat pump]]s in cold conditions, air source heat pumps have lower initial costs and may be the most economic or practical choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are Air Source Heat Pumps A Threat To Geothermal Heat Pump Suppliers?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomkonrad/2014/01/15/are-air-source-heat-pumps-a-threat-to-geothermal-heat-pump-suppliers/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by [[Natural Resources Canada]] found that cold climate air source heat pumps (CC-ASHPs) do work in Canadian winters, based on testing in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]] in late December 2012 to early January 2013 using a ducted CC-ASHP. (The report does not explicitly state whether backup heat sources should be considered for temperatures below −30&amp;nbsp;°C. The record low for Ottawa is −36&amp;nbsp;°C.) The CC-ASHP provided 60% energy (though not energy cost) savings compared to natural gas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cold Climate Air Source Heat Pumps: Results from Testing at the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology |url=http://www.chba.ca/uploads/TRC/May%202013/Cold%20Climate%20Air%20Source%20Heat%20Pumps%20Presentation%20-%20May%202013.pdf |publisher=Natural Resources Canada (Government of Canada) |ref=NRC |accessdate=15 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020150417/http://www.chba.ca/uploads/TRC/May%202013/Cold%20Climate%20Air%20Source%20Heat%20Pumps%20Presentation%20-%20May%202013.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when considering only energy efficiency in the home. When considering energy efficiency in electricity generation however, more energy would be used with the CC-ASHP, relative to natural gas heating, in provinces or territories ([[Alberta]], [[Nova Scotia]], and the [[Northwest Territories]]) where coal-fired generation was the predominant method of electricity generation. (The energy savings in [[Saskatchewan]] were marginal. Other provinces use primarily hydroelectric and/or nuclear generation.) Despite the significant energy savings relative to gas in provinces not relying primarily on coal, the higher cost of electricity relative to natural gas (using 2012 retail prices in Ottawa, Ontario) made natural gas the less expensive energy source. (The report did not calculate the cost of operation in the province of [[Quebec]], which has lower electricity rates, nor did it show the impact of time of use electricity rates.) The study found that in Ottawa a CC-ASHP cost 124% more to operate than the natural gas system. However, in areas where natural gas is not available to homeowners, 59% energy cost savings can be realized relative to heating with fuel oil. The report noted that about 1 million residences in Canada (8%) are still heated with fuel oil. The report shows 54% energy cost savings for CC-ASHPs relative to electric baseboard resistance heating. Based on these savings, the report showed a five-year payback for converting from either fuel oil or electric baseboard resistance heating to a CC-ASHP. (The report did not specify whether that calculation considered the possible need for an electrical service upgrade in the case of converting from fuel oil. Presumably no electrical service upgrade would be needed if converting from electric resistance heat.) The report did note greater fluctuations in room temperature with the heat pump due to its defrost cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cold Climate Air Source Heat Pumps: Results from Testing at the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology |url=http://www.chba.ca/uploads/TRC/May%202013/Cold%20Climate%20Air%20Source%20Heat%20Pumps%20Presentation%20-%20May%202013.pdf |publisher=Natural Resources Canada (Government of Canada) |ref=NRC |accessdate=15 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020150417/http://www.chba.ca/uploads/TRC/May%202013/Cold%20Climate%20Air%20Source%20Heat%20Pumps%20Presentation%20-%20May%202013.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Longevity==
Air source heat pumps can last for over 20 years with low maintenance requirements.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;!-- unreliable sources: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions by Danfoss Heat Pumps|url=http://www.ecoheatpumps.co.uk/heat_pump_faq.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How air source heat pumps work from HomeTips.com|url=http://www.hometips.com/heatpumps-airsource.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; There are numerous heat pumps from the 1970s and 1980s in the United States that are still in service in 2012{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}, even in places where winters are extremely cold. Few moving parts reduce maintenance requirements. However, the outdoor heat exchanger and fan must be kept free from leaves and debris. Heat pumps have more moving parts than an equivalent electric resistance heater or fuel burning heater.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Ground source heat pumps have fewer moving parts than air source heat pumps as they do not need fans or defrosting mechanisms and are located indoors. The ground array for a ground source installation should last for over 100 years.

==Usage==
Air source heat pumps are used to provide interior space heating and cooling even in colder climates, and can be used efficiently for water heating in milder climates. A major advantage of some ASHPs is that the same system may be used for heating in winter and cooling in summer, though it is not true air conditioning without a facility to adjust the humidity of the inside air. Though the [[cost]] of installation is generally high, it is less than the cost of a [[Geothermal heat pump|''ground source'' heat pump]], because a ground source heat pump requires excavation to install its ground loop. The advantage of a ground source heat pump is that it has access to the thermal storage capacity of the ground which allows it to produce more heat for less electricity in cold conditions.

ASHPs are often paired with auxiliary or emergency heat systems to provide backup heat when outside temperatures are too low for the pump to work efficiently, or in the event the pump malfunctions. Since ASHPs have high capital costs, and efficiency drops as temperature decreases, it is generally not cost-effective to size a system for the coldest possible temperature scenario, even if an ASHP could meet the entire heat requirement at the coldest temperatures expected. [[Propane]], natural gas, oil or [[pellet fuel]] furnaces can provide this supplementary heat.

All-electric heat pump systems have an electric furnace or electric resistance heat, or strip heat, which typically consists of rows of electric coils that heat up. A fan blows over the heated coils and circulates warm air throughout the home. This serves as an adequate heating source, but as temperatures go down, electricity costs rise. Electrical service outages pose the same threat as to [[Forced air|central forced-air systems]] and pump-based boilers, but woodstoves and non-electric [[fireplace insert]]s can mitigate this risk. Some ASHPs can be coupled to [[solar panel]]s as primary energy source, with a conventional electric grid as backup source.

Thermal storage solutions incorporating resistance heating can be used in conjunction with ASHPs. Storage may be more cost-effective if time of use electricity rates are available. Heat is stored in high density ceramic bricks contained within a thermally-insulated enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Franklin Energy Services, LLC |title=Air Source Heat Pump Efficiency Gains from  Low Ambient Temperature Operation Using  Supplemental Electric Heating: Thermal Storage Supplemental Heating Systems |url=http://mn.gov/commerce/energy/images/CIP-AirSource-Pump-Report.pdf |publisher=Minnesota Division of Energy Resources; Minnesota Department of Commerce |accessdate=15 October 2014 |page=9 |date=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611123108/http://mn.gov/commerce/energy/images/CIP-AirSource-Pump-Report.pdf |archivedate=11 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ASHPs may also be paired with passive solar heating. Thermal mass (such as concrete or rocks) heated by passive solar heat can help stabilize indoor temperatures, absorbing heat during the day and releasing heat at night, when outdoor temperatures are colder and heat pump efficiency is lower.

The outdoor section on some units may 'frost up' when there is sufficient moisture in the air and outdoor temperature is  between 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 5&amp;nbsp;°C (32&amp;nbsp;°F to 41&amp;nbsp;°F){{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. This restricts air flow across the outdoor coil. These units employ a defrost cycle where the system switches temporarily to 'cooling' mode to move heat from the home to the outdoor coil to melt the ice. This requires the supplementary heater (resistance electric or gas) to activate.  The defrost cycle reduces the efficiency of the heat pump significantly, although the newer (demand) systems are more intelligent and need to defrost less.  As temperatures drop below freezing the tendency for frosting of the outdoor section decreases due to reduced humidity in the air.

It is difficult to retrofit conventional heating systems that use radiators/radiant panels, hot water baseboard heaters, or even smaller diameter ducting, with ASHP-sourced heat. The lower heat pump output temperatures would mean radiators would have to be increased in size or a low temperature [[underfloor heating]] system be installed instead. Alternatively, a high temperature heat pump can be installed and existing heat emitters can be retained.

==Technology==

[[File:Refrigerator-cycle.svg|thumb|A: indoor compartment, B: outdoor compartment, I: insulation, 1: condenser, 2: expansion valve, 3: evaporator, 4: compressor]]
Heating and cooling is accomplished by pumping a [[refrigerant]] through the heat pump's indoor and outdoor coils. Like in a refrigerator, a [[gas compressor|compressor]], [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]], [[expansion valve (steam engine)|expansion valve]] and [[evaporator]] are used to change states of the refrigerant between colder [[liquid]] and hotter [[gas]] states.

When the liquid refrigerant at a low [[temperature]] and low pressure passes through the outdoor heat exchanger coils, ambient heat causes the liquid to boil (change to gas or [[vapor]]): heat energy from the outside air has been absorbed and stored in the refrigerant as [[latent heat]]. The gas is then compressed using an electric pump; the compression increases the temperature of the gas.

Inside the building, the gas passes through a pressure [[valve]] into heat exchanger coils.  There, the hot refrigerant gas condenses back to a liquid and transfers the stored [[latent heat]] to the indoor air, water heating or hot water system. The indoor air or heating water is pumped across the heat exchanger by an electric pump or [[fan (mechanical)|fan]].

The cool liquid refrigerant then re-enter the outdoor heat exchanger coils to begin a new cycle.

Most heat pumps can also operate in a cooling mode where the cold refrigerant is moved through the indoor coils to cool the room air.

==Efficiency ratings==
The 'Efficiency' of air source heat pumps is measured by the [[Coefficient of performance]] (COP). A COP of 3 means the heat pump produces 3 units of heat energy for every 1 unit of electricity it consumes. Within temperature ranges of −3&amp;nbsp;°C to 10&amp;nbsp;°C, the COP for many machines is fairly stable at 3–3.5.

In very mild weather, the COP of an air source heat pump can be up to 4. However, on a cold winter day, it takes more work to move the same amount of heat indoors than on a mild day.&lt;ref&gt;Efficiency of heat pumps in changing conditions, http://www.icax.co.uk/Air_Source_Heat_Pumps.html&lt;/ref&gt; The heat pump's performance is limited by the [[Carnot cycle]] and will approach 1.0 as the outdoor-to-indoor temperature difference increases, which for most air source heat pumps happens as outdoor temperatures approach −18&amp;nbsp;°C / 0&amp;nbsp;°F. Heat pump construction that enables carbon dioxide as a refrigerant may have a COP of greater than 2 even down to −20&amp;nbsp;°C, pushing the break-even figure downward to −30&amp;nbsp;°C (−22&amp;nbsp;°F). A [[ground source heat pump]] has comparatively less of a change in COP as outdoor temperatures change, because the ground from which they extract heat has a more constant temperature than outdoor air.

The design of a heat pump has a considerable impact on its efficiency. Many air source heat pumps are designed primarily as [[air conditioning unit]]s, mainly for use in summer temperatures. Designing a heat pump specifically for the purpose of heat exchange can attain greater COP ratings and an extended life cycle. The principal changes are in the scale and type of compressor and evaporator.

Seasonally adjusted heating and cooling efficiencies are given by the [[heating seasonal performance factor]] (HSPF) and [[seasonal energy efficiency ratio]] (SEER) respectively.

In units charged with [[Organofluorine chemistry#Hydrofluorocarbons|HFC]] [[refrigerants]], the COP rating is reduced when heat pumps are used to heat domestic water to over 60&amp;nbsp;°C or to heat conventional [[central heating]] systems that use radiators to distribute heat (instead of an underfloor heating array).

==Risks and precautions==
*Conventional air source heat pumps lose their capacity as the external temperatures fall below 5 degrees Celsius (about 41 degrees Fahrenheit). CC-ASHPs (see above) may operate efficiently in temperatures as low as −30C, although they may not be as efficient in cooling during the summer season as conventional air source heat pumps. If a conventional air source heat pump is used in colder climates, the system needs an auxiliary source of heat to supplement the heat pump in the event of extremely cold temperatures or when it is simply too cold for the heat pump to work at all.
*An Auxiliary Heat/Emergency Heat system, for example a traditional furnace, is also important if the heat pump is malfunctioning or being repaired. In colder climates, split-system heat pumps matched with gas, oil or [[pellet fuel]] furnaces will work even in extremely cold temperatures.

==Controversy==

Units charged with [[Organofluorine chemistry#Hydrofluorocarbons|HFC]] [[refrigerants]] are often marketed as low energy or a sustainable technology, however if the HFC leaks out from the system, there is potential to contribute to global warming{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}, as measured in [[global warming potential]] (GWP) and [[ozone depletion potential]] (ODP). Recent government mandates{{where?|date=February 2013}} have seen the phase-out of R-22 refrigerant and its replacement with more environmentally sound R-410A refrigerant.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Impact on electric utilities==

While heat pumps with backup systems other than electrical resistance heating are often encouraged by electric utilities, air source heat pumps are a concern for winter-peaking utilities if electrical resistance heating is used as the supplemental or replacement heat source when the temperature drops below the point that the heat pump can meet all of the home's heat requirement. Even if there is a non-electric backup system, the fact that efficiencies of ASHPs decrease with outside temperatures is a concern to electric utilities. The drop in efficiency means their electrical load increases steeply as temperatures drop. A study in Canada's [[Yukon Territory]], where [[diesel generator]]s are used for peaking capacity, noted that widespread adoption of air source heat pumps could lead to increased diesel consumption if the increased electrical demand due to ASHP use exceeds available hydroelectric capacity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Evaluation of Air Source Heat Pump Technology in Yukon|url=http://www.energy.gov.yk.ca/pdf/air_source_heat_pumps_final_may2013_v04.pdf|publisher=Government of Yukon’s Energy Solution Centre and Yukon Energy, Mines and Resources|accessdate=15 October 2014|date=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding those concerns, the study did conclude that ASHPs are a cost effective heating alternative for Yukon residents.
As [[wind farm]]s are increasingly used to supply electricity to the grid, the increased winter load matches well with the increased winter generation from [[wind turbine]]s and calmer days result in decreased heating load for most houses even if the air temperature is low.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3640">In a [[storytelling|story]], we detect an '''''allotopy''''' when two basic meaning traits ([[Seme (semantics)|seme]]s) contradict each other, that is when they trace two incompatible interpretations. It was conceived as being the opposite of an [[Isotopy (semiotics)|isotopy]], which is the homogeneity resulting from repetition of the same seme.&lt;ref name="KlinkenbergAllodef"&gt;[[Jean-Marie Klinkenberg]] (1996) ''Précis de sémiotique générale'', De Boeck, p. 118 [http://www.info-metaphore.com/definition/isotopie.html]&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been coined in the 1970s by the Belgian semioticians known as ''[[Groupe µ]]''.

==History==
In the 1970, the Belgian semioticians known under the name ''[[Groupe µ]]'', introduced the concept of Allotopy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info-metaphore.com/definition/allotopie.html Définition de : l'allotopie]&lt;/ref&gt; They first discussed the concept in publications like ''Isotopie et allotopie'',&lt;ref&gt;DUBOIS J. ; EDELINE F. ; KLINKENBERG J.-M. ; MINGUET P. (1976) ''[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=12751413 Isotopie et allotopie: le fonctionnement rhétorique du texte]'', no14, pp. 41-65 (2 p.)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Isotopie, allotopie et polytopie'' (1976),&lt;ref&gt;Groupe µ (1976) ''Isotopie, allotopie et polytopie : le texte rhétorique'', Versus, 14, 1 976&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A Rhetoric of Poetry'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;Groupe µ (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allotopy and humor==
''[[Groupe µ]]'' discussed the relation of allotopy to [[jokes]] and [[humor]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} [[Salvatore Attardo]], despite not using the term allotopy, formulated a theory of humor based on the idea of the "incompatible interpretations", called the [[isotopy-disjunction model]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Salvatore Attardo]] (2001) ''Humorous texts: a semantic and pragmatic analysis'',  sect.5.3.2, p.83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Salvatore Attardo]] (1994) ''Linguistic theories of humor'', chap.2&lt;/ref&gt; This is part of the broader idea of defining humor as based on [[contradiction]]/[[wikt:incongruity|incongruity]].

[[File:Plan Rome - Arcus Novus.png|thumb|Location of Arcus Novus]]
The '''Arcus Novus''' was an ancient arch in Rome, located on the ''[[Via Lata (Rome)|Via lata]]'' (now the Via del Corso ), at the site of the church of [[Santa Maria in Via Lata]].

== History ==
The arch was dedicated to [[Diocletian]] either for the occasion of his ''[[decennalia]]'' in 293&amp;nbsp;AD, or his [[Roman Triumph|triumph]] celebrated with [[Maximian]] in 303–304. The name Arcus novus (new arch) probably refers to the earlier [[Arch of Claudius (British victory)|Arch of Claudius]] on the same street.{{sfn|Richardson|1992|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=K_qjo30tjHAC&amp;pg=PA27 p.&amp;nbsp;27]}}

== Description ==
The Arcus Novus was decorated with reliefs reused (''[[spolia]]'') from a large altar of the Julio-Claudian period, most probably the ''Ara pietatis'', while the column [[plinths]] were decorated with images of ''[[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]]'', barbarian prisoners and the [[Dioskouri]], probably from the facade of the nearby [[Sol invictus|Temple of the Sun]] of [[Aurelian]]. The arch was destroyed in 1491 by order of Pope [[Innocent VIII]] during reconstruction of Santa Maria in Via Lata.{{sfn|Richardson|1992|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=K_qjo30tjHAC&amp;pg=PA27 p.&amp;nbsp;27]}}

Fragments of the reliefs were discovered in 1523 and added to the [[Andrea della Valle|Della Valle]] collection before being acquired by [[Cardinal Ferdinand de' Medici]] in 1584, from where the plinths found their way to the [[Boboli Gardens]] in Florence. Other fragments from the [[Antonine]] period, reused by [[Diocletian]], were included in the rear facade of the cardinal's [[Villa Medici]] in Rome. More recently excavations carried out in 1923–1933 discovered further fragments now in the [[Capitoline Museums#Centrale_Montemartini|Centrale Montemartini]].{{sfn|Richardson|1992|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=K_qjo30tjHAC&amp;pg=PA27 p.&amp;nbsp;27]}}

[[File:Static Integrated View.jpg|thumb|320px|Building a system out of its requirements - static view]]

'''Behavior trees'''  are a formal, graphical [[modelling language]] used primarily in [[systems engineering|systems]] and [[software engineering]]. Behavior trees employ a well-defined notation to unambiguously represent the hundreds or even thousands of [[natural language]] requirements that are typically used to express the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]] needs for a large-scale software-integrated system.&lt;ref name = "dromey07EngLgeScale"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "dromey06FormalizingTrans"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "dromey03K1-Dromey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dromey07FormalPath"&gt;Wen, L., Dromey, R.G. 2007. [http://www.behaviorengineering.org/images/publications/wen_l_dromey_r_g_gse_change.pdf From Requirements Change to Design Change: A Formal Path]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The amount of detail in the large number of [[natural language]] requirements for a large-scale system causes short-term memory overload&lt;ref name = "dromey07EngLgeScale"&gt;Dromey, R.G. 2007. [http://www.beworld.org/BE/resource/presentation/Eng-LargeScale-Systems.pdf Principles for Engineering Large-Scale Software-Intensive Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="raytheonSysResearch"&gt;Boston, J. 2008. [http://www.raytheon.com.au/Default.aspx?x=501  Raytheon Australia supports pioneering systems research] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915050723/http://www.raytheon.com.au/Default.aspx?x=501 |date=15 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and may create a barrier that prevents anyone from gaining a deep, accurate and holistic understanding of the system needs.&lt;ref name = "raytheonAustJoint"/&gt; Also, because of the use of [[natural language]], there are likely to be many ambiguities, aliases, inconsistencies, redundancies and incompleteness problems associated with the requirements information.&lt;ref name = "dromey03K1-Dromey"/&gt; This adds further to the uncertainty and complexity. Generally, at best, a few people understand parts of the system or situation well, but no one has other than a superficial understanding of the whole – that is, the detailed integrated behavior of the system.

The behavior tree representation, (with the help of the composition tree&lt;ref name = "compositionTree"&gt;Behavior Engineering. [http://www.behaviorengineering.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=24&amp;Itemid=34 Composition Trees]&lt;/ref&gt; representation that resolves alias and other vocabulary problems with large sets of requirements) allows people to avoid short-term memory overload and produce a deep, accurate, holistic representation of system needs&lt;ref name = "dromey07EngLgeScale"/&gt; that can be understood by all [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] because it strictly uses the vocabulary of the original requirements. Because the behavior tree notation uses a [[Semantics of programming languages|formal semantics]], for any given example, it already is, or can be made [[executable]].

=== Behavior tree forms ===
[[File:Set of Requirements Behavior Trees.jpg|thumb|240px|Set of four requirements behavior trees.]]
[[File:Requirements Integration Process.jpg|thumb|240px|Requirements Integration Process]]
Single and composite or integrated behavior tree forms are both important in the application of behavior trees in [[systems engineering|systems]] and [[software engineering]].

* Requirement behavior trees: Initially, individual requirement behavior trees (RBTs) are used to capture all the fragments of behavior in each individual natural language requirement by a process of rigorous, intent-preserving and vocabulary-preserving translation. The translation process can uncover a range of defects in original natural language requirements.
* Integrated behavior trees: Because a set of requirements imply the integrated behavior of a system,  all the individual requirement behavior trees can be composed to construct an integrated behavior tree (IBT) that provides a single holistic view of the emergent integrated behavior of the system. This enables the building of the integrated behavior of a system '''out of''' its requirements.&lt;ref name = "winters"&gt;Winter, K. 2007. [http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv/UQ:100586/Formalising_behaviour_trees_with_csp.pdf Formalising Behaviour Trees with CSP]&lt;/ref&gt;  An analogy to help describe this process is the transition from a randomly arranged set of jigsaw puzzle pieces to putting each of the pieces in its appropriate place. When we do this, we see each piece of information in its intended context and we see the pieces of information as a whole and the emergent properties of the whole.

Having all the requirements converted to behavior trees (RBTs) is similar to having all the pieces for a jigsaw puzzle randomly spread out on a table - until we put all the pieces together we cannot see the emergent picture and whether any pieces are missing or do not fit. Constructing an integrated behavior tree (IBT) allows us to do this.&lt;ref name = "dromey06FormalizingTrans"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "dromey03K1-Dromey"/&gt;

=== Behavior engineering process ===
;Representation used - (critical)
* BEHAVIOR TREES provide a vehicle for growing a shared understanding of a [[complex system]].
* The role of the COMPOSITION TREE in the overall process is to provide a vehicle for overcoming the imperfect knowledge associated with the large set of requirements for a system.

;Process used - (critical)
* BEHAVIOR ENGINEERING uses behavior trees to control complexity while growing a shared understanding of a complex system.
* That shared, holistic understanding of a complex system, because it integrates the requirements, shows the [[emergent behavior]] of the system implied by requirements.

Behavior trees and the concepts for their application in [[systems engineering|systems]] and [[software engineering]] were originally developed by Dromey&lt;ref name="dromey06FormalizingTrans"&gt;R.G.Dromey, [http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/dromey/Dromey-Chapter-Final-20051.pdf "Formalizing the Transition from Requirements to Design"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725053952/http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/dromey/Dromey-Chapter-Final-20051.pdf |date=25 July 2011 }}, in "Mathematical Frameworks for Component Software – Models for Analysis and Synthesis", Jifeng He, and Zhiming Liu (Eds.), World Scientific Series on Component-Based Development, pp. 156-187, (Invited Chapter) (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dromey03K1-Dromey"&gt;R.G.Dromey, [http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/dromey/K1-Dromey.pdf From Requirements to Design: Formalizing the Key Steps] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725054005/http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/dromey/K1-Dromey.pdf |date=25 July 2011 }}, (Invited Keynote Address), SEFM-2003, IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Formal Methods, Brisbane, Sept. 2003, pp. 2-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.L.Glass, [http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/Bob-Glass-GSE-CACM.pdf "Is This a Revolutionary Idea or Not"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725054100/http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/Bob-Glass-GSE-CACM.pdf |date=25 July 2011 }}, Communications of the ACM, Vol. 47(11), pp. 23-25, Nov. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.G.Dromey, [http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/dromey/Dromey.pdf "Climbing Over the ‘No Silver Bullet’ Brick Wall"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725054117/http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/dromey/Dromey.pdf |date=25 July 2011 }}, IEEE Software, Vol. 23, No. 2, pp.118-120, (March 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; with first publication of some of the key ideas in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;R.G.Dromey, Genetic Software Engineering - Simplifying Design Using Requirements Integration, IEEE Working Conference on Complex and Dynamic Systems Architecture, Brisbane, Dec 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Early publications on this work used the terms "genetic software engineering" and "genetic design" to describe the application of behavior trees. The reason for originally using the word genetic was because sets of genes, sets of jigsaw puzzle pieces and sets of requirements represented as behavior trees all appeared to share several key properties:

* they contained enough information as a set to allow them to be composed – with behavior trees this allows a system to be built out of its requirements
* the order in which the pieces were put together was not important – with requirements this aids coping with complexity
* when all the members of the set were put together the resulting integrated entity exhibited a set of important [[emergent properties]].

For behavior trees important emergent properties include 
* the integrated behavior of the system implied by the requirements
* the coherent behavior of each component referred to in the requirements.

These genetic parallels, in another context, were originally spelled by Woolfson,&lt;ref&gt;A. Woolfson, Living Without Genes, Flamingo, 2000, {{ISBN|0-00-255618-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A. Woolfson, Living Without Genes, Flamingo, 2000)

Further weight for use of the term genetic came from eighteenth century thinker [[Giambattista Vico]], who said, "To understand something, and not merely be able to describe it, or analyse it into its component parts, is to understand how it came into being – its genesis, its growth … true understanding is always genetic".&lt;ref name = "Vico"&gt;Berlin, I.  The Crooked Timber of Humanity: Chapters in the History of Ideas, Ed., H.Hardy, Princeton University Press, 1998 {{ISBN|0-691-05838-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these legitimate genetic parallels it was felt that this emphasis led to confusion with the concept of [[genetic algorithms]]. As a result, the term [[behavior engineering]] was introduced to describe the processes that exploit behavior trees to construct systems. The term "behavior engineering" has previously been used in a specialized area of Artificial Intelligence - robotics research. The present use embraces a much broader rigorous formalization and integration of large sets of behavioral and compositional requirements needed to model large-scale systems.

Since the behavior tree notation was originally conceived a number of people from the DCCS (Dependable Complex Computer-based Systems Group – a joint [[University of Queensland]], [[Griffith University]] research group) have made important contributions to the evolution and refinement of the notation and to the use of behavior trees. Members of this group include: David Carrington, Rob Colvin, Geoff Dromey, Lars Grunske, Ian Hayes, Diana Kirk, Peter Lindsay, Toby Myers, Dan Powell, John Seagrott, Cameron Smith, Larry Wen, Nisansala Yatapanage, Kirsten Winter, Saad Zafar, Forest Zheng.

Probabilistic timed behavior trees have recently been developed by Colvin, Grunske and Winter so that reliability, performance and other dependability properties can be expressed.&lt;ref name="probTimedBTs"&gt;Colvin, R., Grunske, L., Winter, K. 2007 [http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/grunske/IFM1.pdf Probabilistic Timed Behavior Trees] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725054158/http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/grunske/IFM1.pdf |date=25 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key concepts ==

=== Behavior tree notation ===
[[File:Core Elements of the Behavior Tree Notation.png|360px|thumb|Core elements of the behavior tree notation]]
A behavior tree is used to formally represent the ''fragment of behavior'' in each individual requirement. Behavior for a large-scale system in general, where [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]] is admitted, appears abstractly as a set of [[communicating sequential processes]]. The behavior tree notation captures these composed component-states in a simple tree-like form.

Behavior is expressed in terms of components realizing states and components creating and breaking relations. Using the logic and graphic forms of conventions found in [[programming languages]], components can support actions, composition, events, control-flow, data-flow, and threads.&lt;ref name = "dromey03K1-Dromey"/&gt;

Traceability tags (see Section 1.2 of behavior tree notation&lt;ref name = "BTNotation" /&gt;) in behavior tree nodes link the formal representation to the corresponding [[natural language]] requirement. Behavior trees accurately capture behavior expressed in the natural language representation of functional requirements. Requirements behavior trees strictly use the vocabulary of the natural language requirements but employ graphical forms for behavior composition in order to eliminate risk of ambiguity. By doing this they provide a direct and clearly traceable relationship between what is expressed in the natural language representation and its [[formal specification]].&lt;ref name="geneticDesign05"&gt;Dromey, R.G. [http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/dromey/Dromey-LNCS-Final2-new.pdf "Genetic Design: Amplifying Our Ability to Deal With Requirements Complexity"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725054508/http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/dromey/Dromey-LNCS-Final2-new.pdf |date=25 July 2011 }}, in S.Leue, and T.J. Systra, Scenarios, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, LNCS 3466, pp. 95 - 108, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

A basis of the notation is that behavior is always associated with some component. Component-states which represent nodes of behavior are composed sequentially or concurrently to construct a behavior tree that represents the behavior expressed in the natural language requirements.  
A behavior tree with leaf nodes may revert (symbolized by adding the [[caret]] operator ^) to an ancestor node to repeat behavior, or start a new thread (symbolized by two carets ^^).

A behavior tree specifies state changes in components, how data and control is passed between components and how [[Threads (computer science)|threads]] interact. There are constructs for creating and breaking relations. There are also constructs for setting and testing [[State (computer science)|states]] of components as well as mechanisms for [[inter-process communication]] that include [[message passing]] (events), shared variable blocking and [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronization]].

=== Semantics ===
The [[Semantics of programming languages|formal semantics]] of behavior trees is given via a [[process algebra]] and its [[operational semantics]].&lt;ref name = "colvinHayesNotation"&gt;Colvin, R., Hayes, I.J. 2006 [http://www.accs.uq.edu.au/documents/TechnicalReports/ACCS_TR_07_01.pdf A Semantics for Behavior Trees]&lt;/ref&gt; The semantics has been used as the basis for developing [[simulation]], [[model checking]] and [[failure mode and effects analysis|failure modes and effects analysis]].&lt;ref name = "colvinHayesNotation" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "automatedFailEffect05"&gt;L.Grunske, P.Lindsay, N.Yatapanage, K.Winter, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/fg0135210h247373/ An Automated Failure Mode and Effect Analysis Based on High-Level Design Specification with Behavior Trees], Fifth International Conference on Integrated Formal Methods (IFM-2005), Eindoven, The Netherlands, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="integratingSafety05"&gt;Zafar, S. and Dromey, R. G., (2005), [http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/dromey/Zafar-IntegratingRequirments.pdf Integrating Safety and Security Requirements into Design of an Embedded System.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725054345/http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/dromey/Zafar-IntegratingRequirments.pdf |date=25 July 2011 }} Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference 2005, 15–17 December, Taipei, Taiwan. IEEE Computer Society Press. pp629-636.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Requirements translation ===
[[File:Requirement Translation Example.jpg|240px|thumb|Example requirement translation]]
[[File:Requirements Behavior Tree Integration.png|thumb|240px|Requirements behavior tree integration]]
Requirements translation is the vehicle used to cross the informal-formal barrier.  Consider the process of translation for requirement R1 below. The first tasks are to identify the components ('''bold'''), identify the behaviors (&lt;u&gt;underline&lt;/u&gt;) and identify indicators of the order (''italics'') in which behaviors take place. The corresponding behavior tree can then be constructed.

What is clear from the outcome of this process is that apart from pronouns, definite articles etc., essentially all the words in the sentences that contribute to the behavior they describe have been accounted for and used.

=== Requirements integration ===
Once the set of requirements are formalized as individual requirement behavior trees, two joint properties of systems and requirements need to be exploited in order to proceed with composing the integrated behavior tree:
* In general, a fragment of behavior expressed by a requirement always has associated with it a precondition which needs to be satisfied before the behavior can take place (this precondition may or may not be expressed in the requirement).
* If the requirement is really part of the system then some other requirement in the set must establish the precondition needed in (1).

:''For requirements represented as behavior trees this amounts to finding where the root node of one tree occurs in some other behavior tree and integrating the two trees at that node.''

The example below illustrates requirements integration for two requirements, R1 and R3. In other words, it shows how these two requirements interact.

=== Operations on integrated behavior trees ===
Once an integrated behavior tree has been composed, there are a number of important operations that can be performed upon it.

==== Inspection: defect detection and correction ====
In general, many defects become much more visible when there is an integrated view of the requirements&lt;ref name = "dromey07EngLgeScale"/&gt; and each requirement has been placed in the behavior context where it needs to execute. For example, it is much easier to tell whether a set of conditions or events emanating from a node is complete and consistent. The traceability tags&lt;ref name = "BTNotation" /&gt; also make it easy to refer back to the original natural-language requirements.  There is also the potential to automate a number of defect and consistency checks on an integrated behavior tree.&lt;ref name = "buildEnv04"&gt;Smith, C., Winter, K., Hayes, I., Dromey, R.G., Lindsay, P., Carrington, D.: [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=01342775 An Environment for Building a System Out of Its Requirements], 19th IEEE International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, Linz, Austria, Sept. (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

When all defects have been corrected and the IBT is logically consistent and complete it becomes a model behavior tree (MBT) which serves as a [[formal specification]] for the system’s behavior that has been constructed out of the original requirements.  This is the clearly defined stopping point for the analysis phase. With other [[Modeling languages|modelling notations]] and methods (for instance, with [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]) it is less clear-cut when modelling can stop.&lt;ref name = "shuttle04" /&gt; In some cases, parts of a model behavior tree may need to be transformed to make the specification [[executable]]. Once an MBT has been made executable it is possible to carry out a number of other dependability checks.

==== Simulation ====
A model behavior tree can be readily simulated to explore the dynamic properties of the system. Both a symbolic tool and a graphics tool have been constructed to support these activities.&lt;ref name = "Integrare07"&gt;L.Wen,  R.Colvin,  K.Lin, J.Seagrott,  N.Yatapanage,  R.G.Dromey,  2007, [http://www98.griffith.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/10072/18625/1/43991_1.pdf "Integrare, a Collaborative Environment for Behavior-Oriented Design"], in Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Cooperative Design, Visualization and Engineering, LNCS 4674, pp. 122-131, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "realTimeColloab06"&gt;C. Sun, S. Xia, D. Sun, D. Chen. H.F. Shen, W. Cai: [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1188816.1188821 "Transparent adaptation of single-user applications for multi-user real-time collaboration"], ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,  Vol. 13, No.4, December 2006, pp.531-582.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Model-checking ====
A translator has been written to convert a model behavior tree into the "actions systems" language. This input can then be fed into the SAL Model-checker&lt;ref name = "SAL2"&gt;Bensalem, S., Ganesh, V., Lakhnech, Y., Muñoz, C., Owre, et al.: "An Overview of SAL", Fifth NASA Langley Formal Methods Workshop (LFM 2000), 2000, pp.187-196.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rushby, J. [http://fm.csl.sri.com/AFM06/slides/Rushby-intro-tutorial.pdf Automated Formal Methods 2006] AFM-2006, Automated Formal Methods 2006, Seattle, August 2006, pp. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to allow checks to be made as to whether certain safety and security properties are satisfied.&lt;ref name = "automatedFailEffect05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="embeddedSys05"&gt;Zafar, S. and Dromey, R. G., 2005. [http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/dromey/Zafar-SETE2005-ManagingComplexity.pdf Managing Complexity in Modelling Embedded Systems.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725054400/http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/dromey/Zafar-SETE2005-ManagingComplexity.pdf |date=25 July 2011 }} Systems Engineering/Test and Evaluation Conference 2005, 7–9 November, Brisbane, Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) ====
[[Model checking|Model-checking]] has often been applied to system models to check that hazardous states cannot be reached during normal operation of the system.&lt;ref name = "probabilistic07"&gt;Grunske, L., Colvin, R., Winter, K. Probabilistic Model-Checking Support for FMEA Quantitative Evaluation of Systems. QEST 2007. Fourth International Conference on the Quantitative Evaluation of Systems, 17-19 Sept. 2007 pp. 119 - 128&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to combine model-checking with behavior trees to provide automated support for [[failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA).&lt;ref name = "automatedFailEffect05" /&gt; The advantage of using behavior trees for this purpose is that they allow the [[formal method]] aspects of the approach to be hidden from non-expert users.

==== Requirements change ====
The ideal that is sought when responding to a change in the [[functional requirements]] for a system is that it can be quickly determined:
* where to make the change,
* how the change affects the architecture of the existing system,
* which components of the system are affected by the change, and
* what behavioral changes will need to be made to the components (and their interfaces) that are affected by the change of requirements.&lt;ref name = "dromey07FormalPath" /&gt;

Because a system is likely to undergo many sets of changes over its service time, there is also a need to record, manage and optimize the system’s evolution driven by the change sequence.

A traceability model, which uses behavior trees as a formal notation to represent functional requirements, reveals change impacts on different types of design constructs (documents) caused by the changes of the requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Wen, L., Dromey, R.G. 2005. [http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/wen/journal.pdf Architecture Normalization for Component-Based Systems] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725054411/http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/wen/journal.pdf |date=25 July 2011 }} Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Formal Aspects of Component Software FACS'05, pp. 247-261.&lt;/ref&gt; The model introduces the concept of evolutionary design documents that record the change history of the designs. From these documents, any version of a design document as well as the difference between any two versions can be retrieved. An important advantage of this model is that the major part of the procedure to generate these evolutionary design documents can be supported by automated tools.&lt;ref name = "buildEnv04" /&gt;

==== Code generation and execution ====
The behavior tree representation of the integrated behavior of the system affords several important advantages as an executable model. It clearly separates the tasks of ''component integration'' from the task of individual ''component implementation''. The integrated behavior of the system that emerges from integrating the requirements can be used as a foundation to create a design by applying design decisions. The result is a design behavior tree (DBT):&lt;ref name = "dromey03K1-Dromey"/&gt; an executable multithreaded component integration specification that has been built out of the original requirements.

Behavior tree models are executed in a virtual machine called the behavior run-time environment (BRE). The BRE links together [[Component-based software engineering#Software component|components]] using middleware,&lt;ref name="middleware"&gt;RTI Inc. 2007 "Meeting Real-Time Requirements in Integrated Defense Systems", [http://www.rti.com/mk/defense_systems.html RTI White Paper] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920033015/http://www.rti.com/mk/defense_systems.html |date=20 September 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing components to be independent programs written in one of several languages that can be executed in a [[Distributed computing|distributed environment]]. The BRE also contains an expression [[parser]] that automatically performs simple operations to minimize the amount of code required to be manually implemented in the component.

The [[Implementation (computing)|implementation]] of components is supported by views that are automatically extractable from the DBT.  These views provide the component behavior trees (CBTs) of individual components together with the interfaces of individual components. This information, together with the information in the integrated composition tree (ICT) captured about each individual component, provides the information that is needed to implement each individual component.

Several BRE’s can be linked together to form complex systems using a system-of-systems construct and the behavior engineering component integration environment (BECIE). BECIE is also used to monitor and control the behavior tree models being executed within a BRE, similar to [[SCADA|supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)]] systems used in industrial process control.

Executable behavior trees have been developed for case studies&lt;ref name="shuttle04"&gt;Dromey, R.G. [http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/dromey/Dromey-SCESM-2004N.pdf Using Behavior Trees to Model the Autonomous Shuttle System] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725054354/http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/dromey/Dromey-SCESM-2004N.pdf |date=25 July 2011 }}, 3rd International Workshop on Scenarios and State Machines: Models, Algorithms, and Tools (SCESM04) ICSE Workshop W5S, Edinburgh, 25 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; including automated train protection,&lt;ref name = "integratingSoftHard08" /&gt; mobile robots with dynamic object following, an ambulatory infusion pump&lt;ref name = "integratingSafety05" /&gt; and traffic light management systems. A version of the BRE suited for embedded systems (eBRE) is also available that has reduced functionality to tailor it to small-footprint microcontrollers.

== Applications ==
Behavior tree modelling can and has been applied to a diverse range of applications over a number of years. Some of the main application areas are described below.

=== Large-scale systems ===
Modeling large-scale systems with large sets of natural-language requirements has always been the major focus for trialling behavior trees and the overall behavior engineering process. Conducting these evaluations and trials of the method has involved work with a number of industry partners and government departments in Australia. The systems studied have included a significant number of defense systems, enterprise systems, transportation systems, information systems, health systems and sophisticated control systems with stringent safety requirements. The results of these studies have all been commercial-in-confidence. However the results of the extensive industry trails&lt;ref name = "raytheonSysResearch" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "raytheonAustJoint" /&gt; with [[Raytheon]] Australia are presented below in the Industry Section.
What all this work has consistently shown is that by translating requirements and creating dynamic and static integrated views of requirements a very significant number of major defects are discovered early, over and above the defects that are found by current industry best-practice.&lt;ref name = "industryTrialsPaper" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "boston08" /&gt;

=== Embedded systems ===
Failure of a design to satisfy a system’s requirements can result in schedule and cost overruns.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, D. 2000. [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/7151/19252/00890177.pdf?arnumber=890177 Requirements modeling technology: a vision for better, faster, and cheaper systems.] Proceedings from VHDL International Users Forum Fall Workshop, 2000. pp. 3 - 6.&lt;/ref&gt; If there are also critical dependability issues, not satisfying system requirements can have life-threatening consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Leveson, N. G. Safeware: System Safety and Computers: [a guide to preventing accidents and losses caused by technology]. Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1995. {{ISBN|0-201-11972-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in current approaches, ensuring requirements are satisfied is often delayed until late in the development process during a cycle of testing and debugging.&lt;ref&gt;Futrell, R. T., Shafer, D.F., Shafer, L.I. Quality Software Project Management (Software Quality Institute Series). Prentice Hall, 2002 {{ISBN|0-13-091297-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work describes how the system development approach, behavior engineering, can be used to develop software for [[embedded system]]s.&lt;ref name = "embeddedSys05" /&gt; The result is a [[model-driven development]] approach that can create embedded system software that satisfies its requirements, as a result of applying the development process.

=== Hardware–software systems ===
Many large-scale systems consist of a mixture of co-dependent software and hardware.  The different nature of software and hardware means they are often modelled separately using different approaches. This can subsequently lead to integration problems due to incompatible assumptions about hardware/software interactions.&lt;ref name = "integratingSoftHard08"&gt;Myers, T., Fritzson, P., Dromey, R.G. 2008. [http://www.ida.liu.se/~petfr/paperlinks/2008-07-Myers-Fritzson-Dromey-EOOLT2008-HardwareSoftwareModeling.pdf Seamlessly Integrating Software &amp; Hardware Modelling for Large-Scale Systems.] 2nd International Workshop on Equation-Based Object-Oriented Languages and Tools (EOOLT 2008), Cyprus, July 2008. pp. 5-15.&lt;/ref&gt; These problems can be overcome by integrating behavior trees with the [[Modelica]], [[mathematical modelling]] approach.&lt;ref name = "integratingSoftHard08" /&gt; The environment and hardware components are modelled using Modelica and integrated with an executable software model that uses behavior trees.

=== Role-based access control ===
To ensure correct implementation of complex [[access control]] requirements, it is important that the validated and verified requirements are effectively integrated with the rest of the system.&lt;ref name = "earlyValidation07"&gt;Zafar, S. Colvin, R., Winter, K., Yatapanage, N., Dromey, R.G. [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/4425817/4425818/04425884.pdf?arnumber=4425884 Early Validation and Verification of a Distributed Role-Based Access Control Model.] 14th Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference, Nagoya, Japan, December 2008. pp. 430 - 437.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important that the system can be validated and verified early in the development process. An integrated, role-based access control model has been developed.&lt;ref name = "verifValid06" /&gt; The model is based on the graphical behavior tree notation, and can be validated by [[simulation]], as well as verified using a [[model checker]]. Using this model, access control requirements can be integrated with the rest of the system from the outset, because: a single notation is used to express both access control and [[functional requirements]]; a systematic and incremental approach to constructing a formal behavior tree specification can be adopted; and the specification can be simulated and model checked. The effectiveness of the model has been evaluated using a case study with distributed access control requirements.&lt;ref name = "earlyValidation07" /&gt;

=== Biological systems ===
Because behavior trees describe complex behavior, they can be used for describing a range of systems not limited to those that are
computer-based.&lt;ref name = "contracts02" /&gt; In a biological context, BTs can be used to piece together a procedural interpretation of biological functions
described in research papers, treating the papers as the requirements documents as described above.  This can help to construct a more concrete description of the process than is possible from reading only, and can also be used as the basis for comparing competing theories in alternative papers.  In ongoing research, the behavior trees notation is being used to develop models of the brain function in rats under [[fear conditioning]].

=== Game AI modeling ===
{{main|Behavior tree (artificial intelligence, robotics and control)}}

While BTs have become popular for modeling the [[artificial intelligence]] in computer games such as Halo&lt;ref name = "HaloBT"&gt;Damian Isla [http://www.gamasutra.com/gdc2005/features/20050311/isla_01.shtml Handling Complexity in the Halo 2 AI.]&lt;/ref&gt; and Spore,&lt;ref name = "sporeBT"&gt;Chris Hecker [http://chrishecker.com/My_Liner_Notes_for_Spore/Spore_Behavior_Tree_Docs My Liner Notes for Spore]&lt;/ref&gt; these types of trees are very different from the ones described on this page, and are closer to a combination of hierarchical [[finite state machines]] or [[decision trees]].  Soccer-player modeling has also been a successful application of BTs.&lt;ref name = "SoccerBT"&gt;Xiao-Wen Terry Liu and Jacky Baltes [http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/~jacky/Publications/pdf/liu04:_intuit_flexib_archit_intel_mobil_robot.pdf An Intuitive and Flexible Architecture for Intelligent Mobile Robots] 2nd International Conference on Autonomous Robots and Agents

The first industry trials to test the feasibility of the method and refine its capability were conducted in 2002. Over the last three years a number of systematic industry trials on large-scale defence, transportation and enterprise systems have been conducted.&lt;ref name = "raytheonSysResearch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="industryTrialsPaper"&gt;Powell, D. 2007. [http://www.behaviorengineering.org/docs/ASWEC07_Industry_Powell.pdf Requirements Evaluation Using Behavior Trees - Findings from Industry] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725061927/http://www.behaviorengineering.org/docs/ASWEC07_Industry_Powell.pdf |date=25 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This work has established that the method scales to systems with large numbers of requirements but also that it is important to use tool support&lt;ref name = "Integrare07" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "RaytheonAswec08" /&gt; in order to efficiently navigate and edit such large integrated views of graphical data. Several main results have come out of this work with industry. On average, over a number of projects, 130 confirmed major defects per 1000 requirements have consistently been found after normal reviews and corrections have been made.&lt;ref name = "industryTrialsPaper" /&gt;  With less mature requirements sets much higher defect rates have been observed.

An important part of this work with industry has involved applying the analysis part of the method to six large-scale defence projects for [[Raytheon]] Australia. They see the method as "a key risk mitigation strategy, of use in both solution development and as a means of advising the customer on problems with acquisition documentation".&lt;ref name = "boston08" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNicholas, D., (Raytheon Australia), 2007.

== Benefits, advantages ==
As a behavior modelling representation, behavior trees have a number of significant benefits and advantages:
* They employ a well-defined and effective strategy for dealing with requirements complexity, particularly where the initial needs of a system are expressed using hundreds or thousands of requirements written in natural language. This significantly reduces the risk on large-scale projects.&lt;ref name = "industryTrialsPaper"/&gt;
* By rigorously translating then integrating requirements at the earliest possible time they provide a more effective means for uncovering requirements defects than competing methods.&lt;ref name = "industryTrialsPaper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boston08"&gt;Boston, J., (Raytheon Australia), [http://www.behaviorengineering.org/images/publications/dromey2/sp8_powerpoint_jim_boston.pdf Behavior Trees - How they improve Engineering Behaviour?]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 6th Annual Software and Systems Engineering Process Group Conference (SEPG 2008), Melbourne, Aug. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* They employ a single, simple notation&lt;ref name = "BTNotation" /&gt; for [[analysis]], [[Specification (computing)|specification]] and to represent the behavior design of a system.
* They represent the system behavior as an executable integrated whole.
* They build the behavior of a system out of its [[functional requirements]] in a directly traceable way which aids [[verification and validation]].&lt;ref name = "Integrare07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="verifValid06"&gt;Zafar, S., K.Winter, R.Colvin, R.G.Dromey, [http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/dromey/Zafar_Integrated_BTRBAC.pdf "Verification of an Integrated Role-Based Access Control Model"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725061854/http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/dromey/Zafar_Integrated_BTRBAC.pdf |date=25 July 2011 }}, 1st International Workshop - Asian Working Conference on Verified Software (AWCVS'06), pp 230-240, Macao, Oct. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* They can be understood by [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] without the need for [[formal methods]] training.  By strictly retaining the vocabulary of the original requirements this eases the burden of understanding.
* They have a [[Semantics of programming languages|formal semantics]],&lt;ref name = "colvinHayesNotation" /&gt; they support [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]], they are [[executable]] and they can be [[simulated]], [[Model checking|model-checked]] and used to undertake [[failure mode and effects analysis]].&lt;ref name = "automatedFailEffect05" /&gt;
* They can be used equally well to model human processes, to analyse contracts,&lt;ref name = "contracts02"&gt;Milosevic, Z., Dromey, R.G. [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/8230/25384/01137692.pdf?arnumber=1137692 On Expressing and Monitoring Behavior in Contracts], EDOC 2002, Proceedings, 6th International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference, Lausanne, Switzerland, Sept. 2002, pp. 3-14.&lt;/ref&gt; to represent forensic information, to represent biological systems, and numerous other applications. In each case they deliver the same benefits in terms of managing complexity, and seeing things as a whole. They can also be used for [[Safety-critical system|safety critical systems]],&lt;ref name = "integratingSafety05" /&gt; [[embedded systems]]&lt;ref name = "embeddedSys05" /&gt; and [[real-time systems]].&lt;ref name="realTimeCollab05"&gt;Lin, K., Chen, D., Sun, C., Dromey, R.G., [http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/kailin/CDVEO5_Kevin.pdf A Constraint Maintenance Strategy and Applications in real-time Collaborative Environments]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 2nd International Conference on Cooperative Design, Visualization and Engineering (CDVE2005), 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dataflowContstraint06"&gt;Lin, K., Chen, D., Dromey, R.G., Sun, CZ.: [http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/kailin/IEEE06_Kevin.pdf Multi-way Dataflow Constraint Propagation in Real-time Collaborative Systems] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725061427/http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/kailin/IEEE06_Kevin.pdf |date=25 July 2011 }}, IEEE, The 2nd International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom 2006), Atlanta, Georgia, USA, Nov, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timeBT07"&gt;Grunske, L., Winter, K., Colvin, R., [http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/grunske/ASWEC20072.pdf "Timed Behavior Trees and their application to verifying real-time systems"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118165542/http://www.behaviorengineering.org/publications/grunske/ASWEC20072.pdf |date=18 November 2008 }}, Proceedings of 18th Australian Conference on Software Engineering (AEWEC 2007), April 2007, accepted for publication.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms, disadvantages ==
* For small textbook level examples, their tree-like nature means that the graphic models produced are sometimes not as compact as [[State diagram|statechart]] or [[state machine]] behavior specifications.
* Tool support is needed to navigate the very large integrated behavior trees for systems that have hundreds or thousands of requirements.
* For group walkthroughs of very large systems good display facilities are needed.
* There is a need to provide additional sophisticated tool support to fully exploit integrated behavior tree models.

{{Environment sidebar}}  

A '''biophysical  environment''' is a [[life|biotic]] and [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] surrounding of an [[organism]] or [[population]], and consequently includes the factors that have an influence in their survival, development, and evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Biology online| title=''Environment. Definition''| url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Environment| accessdate=2012-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A biophysical environment can vary in scale from [[microscopic]] to global in extent. It can also be subdivided according to its attributes. Examples include the [[marine environment]], the [[atmospheric environment]] and the [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The term ''[[:wikt:environment|environment]]'' can refer to a singular global environment in relation to [[human]]ity, or a local biophysical environment, e.g. the UK's [[Environment Agency]].

==Life-environment interaction==
All life that has survived must have adapted to conditions of its environment. Temperature, light, humidity, soil nutrients, etc., all influence any species, within any environment. However life in turn modifies, in various forms, its conditions. Some long term modifications along the history of our planet have been significant, such as the incorporation of [[oxygen]] to the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]. This process consisted in the breakdown of [[carbon dioxide]] by [[anaerobic microorganism]]s that used the carbon in their [[metabolism]] and released the [[Atmospheric chemistry|oxygen to the atmosphere]]. This led to the existence of oxygen-based plant and animal life, the [[great oxygenation event]]. Other interactions are more immediate and simple, such as the smoothing effect that forests have on the temperature cycle, compared to neighboring unforested areas.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

[[Environmental science]] is the study of the interactions within the biophysical environment. Part of this [[Branches of science|scientific discipline]] is the investigation of the [[effect of human activity on the environment]]. [[Ecology]], a sub-discipline of biology and a part of environmental sciences, is often mistaken as a study of human induced effects on the environment. [[Environmental studies]] is a broader [[academic discipline]] that is the systematic study of interaction of humans with their environment. It is a broad field of study that includes the [[natural environment]], [[built environment]]s and [[social environment]]s.

Environmentalism is a broad social and philosophical movement that, in a large part, seeks to minimise and compensate the negative effect of human activity on the biophysical environment. The issues of concern for environmentalists usually relate to the natural environment with the more important ones being [[climate change]], [[species]] [[extinction]], [[pollution]], and [[old growth forest]] loss.

One of the studies related include employing Geographic Information Science to study the biophysical environment.&lt;ref&gt;Deng, Y. X., and J. P.

== Education and training ==
In France, conservators specialized in graphic arts and books are trained at the [[Institut national du patrimoine|Institut National du Patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). Their mission is to intervene when heritage resources are threatened or deteriorated for several reasons. The conservator prevents works of art from disappearing or loses its purpose whilst analyzing the complex stage of its material history and the cause of alteration.

'''The Centre for Development Studies''' (CDS), [[Trivandrum]], Kerala, India is a social science research institution. Its main objective is to promote research, teaching and training in disciplines relevant to development. 

The institute was established in 1971 by the economist [[Professor]] [[K. N. Raj]].

== Overview ==
Set up in 1971 by the late legendary economist Professor K.N. Raj, the Centre for Development Studies (CDS) is a self-governing institution known for its research in applied economics and topics germane to socio-economic development, pedagogy, and training programmes.  TCDS is housed in Prasanth Nagar, a hamlet off the [[Thiruvananthapuram]] city. It is easily accessible by road, rail and air.  The 10 acre campus is designed and delivered by late [[Laurie Baker]].  The K. N. Raj Library at CDS is one of the biggest repositories of books in South India with over 1,700,000 titles in economics and related disciplines and subscribing to about 260 print and 1800 online professional journals. It has a faculty strength of about 20.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Research at CDS is organised into six distinct themes:

* [[Agriculture]] and [[Natural Resource]]
* [[Gender]], [[Human migration|Migration]], [[Population]]
* [[Health]] and [[Education]]
* [[Poverty]], [[Vulnerability]] and [[Social security|Social Security]]
* [[Industry]]
* [[Trade]] and [[Technology]]
There is a seventh cross-cutting theme, analysing the impact of globalisation on each of the six themes.

The teaching programme of the CDS includes:

*A two-year M.A. Programme in [[Applied Economics]]
*A two-year M.Phil. Programme in [[Applied Economics]]
*A four-year Ph.D. Programme in [[Economics]].
All three programmes are affiliated to [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru University]], New Delhi.  The [[University of Kerala]] also has recognised CDS as a Centre for its doctoral studies. Besides, it has a number of short-duration occasional training programmes.

==The Organizational Structure==
The core financial support to the Centre comes from the Government of Kerala and the [[Indian Council of Social Science Research]]. [[Reserve Bank of India]] and the [[Planning Commission of India]] have instituted endowment units for research in selected areas at CDS.  The Union Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs has established a migration unit at CDS to study issues relating to international migration from India.

The governance of CDS rests with the Governing Body consisting of academicians from across India. It follows a unique{{cn|date=August 2018}} style of decentralization in governance through various bodies assisting the Director in the management.

The present chairman of the Governing Body is Shri. K. M. Chandrasekhar. The current Director is Professor Sunil Mani.

==Research==
#Agriculture, Water and Natural Resources: Pace and pattern of agricultural growth across regions in India with focus on the role of price and non-price factors in agricultural growth. Trade liberalisation and agriculture: opportunities and challenges factors, processes and determinants of agricultural and non-agricultural employment. Changes in the pattern of irrigation development and its linkages to agricultural development; changing pattern of water use in agriculture and non-agricultural sectors; pricing of water; institutional and technological issues in water management and sharing water between river basins and by states. Linkage between agricultural development and environmental degradation; macro- economic policies; natural resource utilisation and environmental protection.
#Gender and Development: Gender equality and development; gender analysis of public expenditure choices and the gender impact of specific macro and sectoral policies.

'''Circles of Sustainability''' is a method for understanding and assessing [[sustainability]], and for managing projects directed towards socially sustainable outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= with Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_ | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to handle 'seemingly intractable problems'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://citiesprogramme.com/cities |title=CITIES - The Cities Programme |work=citiesprogramme.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as outlined in [[sustainable development]] debates. The method is mostly used for cities and urban settlements.

Circles of Sustainability, and its treatment of the social domains of ecology, economics, politics and culture, provides the empirical dimension of an approach called '[[engaged theory]]'. Developing Circles of Sustainability is part of larger project called 'Circles of Social Life', using the same four-domain model to analyze questions of resilience, adaptation, security, reconciliation. It is also being used in relation to thematics such as 'Circles of Child Wellbeing' (with World Vision).

The rationale for this new method is clear. As evidenced by Rio+20 and the UN Habitat World Urban Forum in Napoli (2012) and Medellin (2014), sustainability assessment is on the global agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhabitat.org/categories.asp?catid=672|accessdate=September 9, 2012|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911065400/http://www.unhabitat.org/categories.asp?catid=672#|archive-date=11 September 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the more complex the problems, the less useful current sustainability assessment tools seem to be for assessing across different domains: economics, ecology, politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Magee, Paul James, Andy Scerri, ‘Measuring Social Sustainability: A Community-Centred Approach’, Applied Research in the Quality of Life, vol. 7, no. 3., 2012, pp. 239–61.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Triple Bottom Line]] approach tends to take the economy as its primary point of focus with the domain of the environmental as the key externality. Secondly, the one-dimensional quantitative basis of many such methods means that they have limited purchase on complex qualitative issues. Thirdly, the size, scope and sheer number of indicators included within many such methods means that they are often unwieldy and resist effective implementation. Fourthly, the restricted focus of current indicator sets means that they do not work across different organizational and social settings—corporations and other institutions, cities, and communities.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Magee, Andy Scerri, Paul James, Lin Padgham, James Thom, Hepu Deng, Sarah Hickmott, and Felicity Cahill, ‘Reframing Sustainability Reporting: Towards an Engaged Approach’, Environment, Development and Sustainability, vol. 15, no. 1, 2013, pp. 225–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Most indicator approaches, such as the Global Reporting Initiative or ISO14031, have been limited to large corporate organizations with easily definable legal and economic boundaries. Circles of Sustainability was developed to respond to those limitations.

==History==
The method began with a fundamental dissatisfaction with current approaches to [[sustainability]] and [[sustainable development]], which tended to treat economics as the core domain and ecology as an externality. Two concurrent developments provided impetus: a major project in Porto Alegre, and a United Nations’ paper called ''Accounting for Sustainability'', Briefing Paper, No. 1, 2008. The researchers developed a method and an integrated set of tools for assessing and monitoring issues of sustainability while providing guidance for project development.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie McCarthy, Paul James and Carolines Bayliss, eds, ''Sustainable Cities, Vol. 1'', United Nations Global Compact, Cities Programme, New York and Melbourne, 2010, 134pp.&lt;/ref&gt; The method was then further refined through projects in Melbourne and Milwaukee, and through an ARC-funded cross-disciplinary project&lt;ref&gt;‘Semantic Technologies to Help Machines Understand Us: Fuji Xerox leads RMIT to $1.4m Grant for Real-Time Green Reports’, ''IT Business'', 30 October 2009.

However, unlike this system, the Canadian index data-sets are focused on measuring the physical footprints of human activity and greenspace footprints which are less subjectivity than cultural and economic&lt;ref&gt;‘Subjectivity in Economics’, ''SSRN'', June 1, 2012. Matthew T. Clements, ‘Abstract: Economics cannot claim to be absolutely objective...’,''St. Edward's University'', &lt;/ref&gt; indicators.

==Use of the method==
The method is used by a series of global organizations including the [[United Nations Global Compact]] Cities Programme, The World Association of Major Metropolises,&lt;ref&gt;The methodology was used by Metropolis for Commission 2, 2012, Managing Urban Growth. This Commission, which met across the period 2009–2011, was asked to make recommendations for use by Metropolis’s 120 member cities on the theme of managing growth. The Commission Report using the ‘Circles of Sustainability’ methodology was published on the web in three languages—English, French and Spanish—and is used by member cities as a guide to practice. (See http://www.metropolis.org/publications/commissions {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819002102/http://www.metropolis.org/publications/commissions# |date=19 August 2012 }})&lt;/ref&gt; and [[World Vision]] to support their engagement in cities. It is also used by a number of cities across the world in different ways to manage major projects or to provide feedback on their sustainability profiles (e.g., Hyderabad, Johannesburg, Melbourne, New Delhi, São Paulo and Tehran). It is a method for understanding [[urban politics]] and [[urban planning]], as well as for conducting [[sustainability]] analysis and profiling [[sustainable development]].

===Global Compact Cities Programme===
The methodology is made available by UN Global Compact Cities Programme for its engagement with its more than 80 Signatory Cities. In particular, some of the 14 Innovating Cities in the programme have influenced the development of the Circles of Sustainability method through their management of major projects, some with intensity and others as a background feature. They use a cross-sectoral and holistic approach for developing a response to self-defined seemingly intractable problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://citiesprogramme.com/cities |title=CITIES - The Cities Programme |work=citiesprogramme.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Porto Alegre, Vila Chocolatão project====

The Vila Chocolatão project refers to the 2011 resettlement of approximately 1,000 residents of the inner-city Vila Chocolatão slum in [[Porto Alegre]], Brazil. The resettlement project of Vila Chocolatão commenced in 2000 in response to an imminent eviction of the community, with community members seeking resources and support to resettle through the city of Porto Alegre's renown [[participatory budgeting]] system. The lengthy preparation to resettle was led by a local cross-sectoral network group, the Vila Chocolatão Sustainability Network. The group was initially instigated by the Regional Court, TRF4 and consisted of the Vila Chocolatão Residents Association, local government departments, federal agencies, non-government organisations and the corporate sector. The project was supported by the City of Porto Alegre through the municipality’s Local Solidarity Governance Scheme. In 2006, the Vila Chocolatao resettlement project was recognised as a pilot project for the then new Cities Programme cross-sectoral model with City Hall assembling a Critical Reference Group to identify critical issues and joint solutions to those issues involved in the resettlement.

This long-standing collaborative project has been successful in rehousing a whole community of slum dwellers, it has also effected a restructuring of how the city approaches slums. The project ensured sustainability was built into the relocation through changes such as setting up of recycling depots next to existing slums and developing a formal recycling sorting facility in the new site, Residencial Nova Chocolatão, linked to the garbage-collection process of the city (an example of linking the sub-domains of ‘emission and waste’ and ‘organization and governance’); and establishing a fully resourced early childhood centre in the new community. The Vila Chocolatão Sustainability Network group continues to meet and work with the community post the resettlement.  This network-led model is now being utilized by the City of Porto Alegre with other informal settlements.

====Milwaukee, water sustainability project====

In 2009, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States of America, wanted to address the issue of water quality in the city.&lt;ref&gt;''Milwaukee Business Journal'', 29 April 2009; John Schmid, ''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel'', 27 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Circles of Sustainability methodology became the basis for an integrated city project. In the period of the application of the method (2009–present) there has been a rediscovery of the value of water from an industry and broader community perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://citiesprogramme.com/cities/americas/usa/milwaukee |title=Milwaukee - The Cities Programme |work=citiesprogramme.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Milwaukee won the United States Water Prize given by the Clean Water America Alliance, as well as a prize from IBM Better Cities program worth $500,000. The community has also attracted some leading water treatment innovators and is establishing a graduate School of Freshwater Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewatercouncil.com/temp2/un-global-compact/ |title=UN Global Compact &amp;#124; Milwaukee Water Council |work=thewatercouncil.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815005612/http://www.thewatercouncil.com/temp2/un-global-compact/# |archive-date=15 August 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metropolis (World  Association of the Major Metropolises)===
The methodology was first used by Metropolis for ''Commission 2, 2012, Managing Urban Growth''. This Commission, which met across the period 2009–2011, was asked to make recommendations for use by Metropolis’s 120 member cities on the theme of managing growth. The Commission Report using the Circles of Sustainability methodology was published on the web in three languages—English, French and Spanish—and is used by member cities as a guide to practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metropolis.org/publications/commissions |title=Publications / Commissions &amp;#124; Metropolis |work=metropolis.org |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819002102/http://www.metropolis.org/publications/commissions# |archive-date=19 August 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the research team were invited by Metropolis to work with the Victorian Government and the Cities Programme on one of their major initiatives. The methodology is central to the approach used by the ‘Integrated Strategic Planning and Public-Private Partnerships Initiative’ organized by Metropolis, 2012–2013 for Indian, Brazilian and Iranian cities. A workshop was held in New Delhi, 26–27 July 2012, and senior planners from New Delhi, Hyderabad and Kolkata used the two of the assessment tools in the Circles of Sustainability toolbox to map the sustainability of their cities as part of developing their urban-regional plans. Other cities to use the same tools have been Tehran (in relation to their mega-projects plan) and São Paulo (in relation to their macro-metropolitan plan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metropolis.org/news/metropolis-initiative-integrated--1 |title=Metropolis Initiative "Integrated Strategic Planning and Public Private Partnerships" meets in New Delhi &amp;#124; Metropolis |work=metropolis.org |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, the Cities Programme and Metropolis have worked together to refine the 'Circles of Sustainability' method to use with their respective member cities. A Metropolis Taskforce was charged with further developing the method.

===''The Economist''===
In 2011, ''The Economist'' invited [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] (Director of the [[United Nations Global Compact]] Cities Programme) and Chetan Vedya (Director, National Institute of Urban Affairs, India) into a debate around the question of urban sustainability and metropolitan growth. It led to over 200 letters to the editor in direct response as well as numerous linked citations on other websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.economist.com/debate/overview/192 |title=Economist Debates: Cities |work=economist.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Vision===
In 2011, recognising how much the two processes of urbanization and globalization were changing the landscape of poverty, [[World Vision]] decided to shift its orientation towards urban settings. Previously 80 per cent of its projects had been in small rural communities. The Circles of Sustainability method now underpins that reorientation and pilot studies are being conducted in India, South Africa, Lebanon, Indonesia and elsewhere, to refine the methodology for aid delivery in complex urban settings.

==Domains and subdomains==
The Circles of Sustainability approach is explicitly critical of other domain models such as the [[triple bottom line]] that treat economics as if it is outside the social, or that treat the environment as an externality. It uses a four-domain model - economics, ecology, politics and culture. In each of these domains there are 7 subdomains.

===Economics===
The economic domain is defined as the practices and meanings associated with the production, use, and management of resources, where the concept of ‘resources’ is used in the broadest sense of that word.
# Production and resourcing
# Exchange and transfer
# Accounting and regulation
# Consumption and use
# Labour and welfare
# Technology and infrastructure
# Wealth and distribution

===Ecology===
The ecological domain is defined as the practices and meanings that occur across the intersection between the social and the natural realms, focusing on the important dimension of human engagement with and within nature, but also including the built-environment.
# Materials and energy
# Water and air
# Flora and fauna
# Habitat and settlements
# Built-form and transport
# Embodiment and sustenance
# Emission and waste

===Politics===
The political is defined as the practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power, such as organization, authorization, legitimation and regulation. The parameters of this area extend beyond the conventional sense of politics to include not only issues of public and private governance but more broadly social relations in general.
# Organization and governance
# Law and justice
# Communication and critique
# Representation and negotiation
# Security and accord
# Dialogue and reconciliation
# Ethics and accountability

===Culture===
The cultural domain is defined as the practices, discourses, and material expressions, which, over time, express continuities and discontinuities of social meaning.
# Identity and engagement
# Creativity and recreation
# Memory and projection
# Belief and ideas
# Gender and generations
# Enquiry and learning
# Wellbeing and health

'''Cosmic infrared background ''' is  [[infrared radiation]] caused by [[Cosmic dust|stellar dust]].

==History==

Recognizing the cosmological importance of the darkness of the night sky ([[Olbers' paradox]]) and the first speculations on an [[extragalactic background light]] dates back to the first half of the 19th century. Despite its importance, the first attempts were made only in the 1950-60s to derive the value of the visual background due to galaxies, at that time based on the integrated starlight of these stellar systems. In the 1960s the absorption of starlight by dust was already taken into account, but without considering the re-emission of this absorbed energy in the [[infrared]]. At that time [[Jim Peebles]] pointed out, that in a [[Big Bang]]-created Universe there must have been a cosmic infrared background (CIB) - different from the [[cosmic microwave background]] - that can account for the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies.

In order to produce today's [[metallicity]], early galaxies must have been significantly more powerful than they are today. In the early CIB models the absorption of starlight was neglected, therefore in these models the CIB peaked between 1-10μm wavelengths. These early models have already shown correctly that the CIB was most probably fainter than its foregrounds, and so it was very difficult to observe. Later the discovery and observations of high luminosity infrared galaxies in the vicinity of the [[Milky Way]] showed, that the peak of the CIB is most likely at longer wavelengths (around 50μm), and its full power could be ~1-10% of that of the [[CMB]].

As [[Martin Harwit]] emphasized, the CIB is very important in the understanding of some special astronomical objects, like [[quasars]] or [[ultraluminous infrared galaxies]], which are very bright in the infrared. He also pointed out, that the CIB cause a significant attenuation for very high energy electrons, protons and gamma-rays of the [[cosmic radiation]] through inverse [[Compton scattering]], photopion and electron-positron pair production.

In the early 1980s there were only upper limits available for the CIB. The real observations of the CIB began after the era of astronomical satellites working in the infrared, started by the [[Infrared Astronomy Satellite]] (IRAS), and followed by the [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] (COBE), the [[Infrared Space Observatory]] (ISO) and by the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]. Exploration of the CIB was continued by the [[Herschel Space Observatory]], launched in 2009.

The Spitzer wide area surveys have detected anisotropies in the CIB.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Kate. [http://www.tgdaily.com/space-features/63904-nasa-spots-glow-of-universes-first-objects "NASA spots glow of universe's first objects."] ''TG Daily'', June 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the cosmic infrared background ==

One of the most important questions about the CIB is the source of its energy. In the early models the CIB was built up from the [[redshifted]] [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]] of the galaxies found in our cosmic neighborhood. However, these simple models could not reproduce the observed features of the CIB. In the baryonic material of the Universe there are two sources of large amounts of energy: nuclear fusion and gravitation.

Nuclear fusion takes place inside the stars, and we can really see this light redshifted: this is the main source of the [[cosmic ultraviolet- and visual background]].  However, a significant amount of this starlight is not observed directly. Dust in the host galaxies can absorb it and re-emit it in the infrared, contributing to the CIB. Although most of today's galaxies contain little dust (e.g. [[elliptical galaxies]] are practically dustless), there are some special stellar systems even in our vicinity which are extremely bright in the infrared and at the same time faint (often almost invisible) in the optical. These [[ultraluminous infrared galaxies]] (ULIRGs) are just in a very active [[star formation]] period: they are just in a collision or in a merge with another galaxy. In the optical this is hidden by the huge amount of dust, and the galaxy is bright in the infrared due to the same reason. Galaxy collisions and mergers were more frequent in the cosmic past: the global [[star formation rate]] of the Universe peaked around [[redshift]] ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1...2, and was 10 to 50 times the average value today. These galaxies in the ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1...2 redshift range give 50 to 70 percent of the full brightness of the CIB.

Another important component of the CIB is the infrared emission by [[quasars]]. In these systems most of the [[gravitational potential energy]] of the matter falling into the central [[black hole]] is converted into [[X-rays]], which would escape unless they are absorbed by the dust torus of the [[accretion disc]]. This absorbed light is again re-emitted in the infrared, and in total gives about 20-30% of the full power of the CIB; however at some specific wavelengths this is the dominant source of CIB energy.

A hitherto unrecognised population of [[intergalactic stars]] have been shown to explain the CIB as well as the other elements of the [[diffuse extragalactic background radiation]]. If intergalactic stars were to account for all of the background anisotropy, it would require a very large population, but this is not excluded by observations and could in fact also explain a fair part of the [[dark matter]] problem as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.6031v1.pdf|title=A measurement of the intrahalo light fraction with near-infrared background anisotropies |author=Cooray et.al. |publisher=Nature |date=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1411.pdf|title=On the Origin of Near-Infrared Extragalactic Background Light Anisotropy |author=Zemcov et.al. |publisher=Nature |date=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foregrounds==

The most important foreground components of the CIB are the following:
*[[Zodiacal light|Zodiacal emission]]: the thermal emission of microscopic dust particles in the [[Solar System]] (from near- to mid-infrared)
*Thermal emission of small [[asteroids]] in the [[Solar System]] (from near- to mid-infrared)
*[[infrared cirrus|Galactic cirrus emission]] (far-infrared)
*Faint [[galaxy|galactic]] [[star]]s (in the [[near-infrared]], λ&lt;20μm)
*Infrared emission of [[Intracluster medium|intracluster dust]] in the [[Local Group]]
*The [[cosmic microwave background]] - although physically it is not a "foreground" - is also considered as an important contaminating source of emission at very long infrared wavelengths (λ&gt;300μm)

These components must be separated for a clear CIB detection.

== Observation of the cosmic infrared background ==

The detection of the CIB is both observationally and astrophysically very challenging. It has a very few characteristics which can be used to separate it from the foregrounds. One major point is, that the CIB must be isotropic, i.e. one has to measure the same CIB value all over the sky. It also lacks suspicious spectral features, since the final shape of its spectrum is the sum of the spectra of sources in the line of sight at various redshifts.

=== Direct detection ===

Direct measurements are simple, but very difficult. One just has to measure the total incoming power, and determine the contribution of each [[sky background]] component. The measurement has to be repeated in many directions to determine the contribution of the foregrounds. After the removal of all other components the remaining power - if it is the same constant value in any direction - is the CIB at that specific wavelength. In practice, one needs an instrument which is able to perform [[absolute photometry]], i.e. it has some mechanism to fully block incoming light for an accurate zero level determination ([[cold shutter]]). Since the instrument parts, including the shutter, have non-zero temperatures and emit in the infrared, this is a very difficult task.

The first, and still the most extensive, direct CIB measurements were performed by the [[DIRBE]] instrument of the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] satellite. After the removal of the precisely determined [[zodiacal emission]] contribution (which was based on the measured annual variation) the remaining power at longer infrared wavelength contained basically two components: the CIB and the Galactic cirrus emission. The infrared surface brightness of the Galactic cirrus must correlate with the neutral hydrogen column densities, since they originate from the same, low density structure.  After the removal of the HI-correlated part, the remaining surface brightness was identified as the cosmic infrared background at 60, 100, 140 and 240μm. At shorter wavelengths the CIB level could not be correctly determined.

Later, short wavelength DIRBE measurements at 2.2 and 3.5μ were combined with the Two Micron Sky Survey ([[2MASS]]) source count data, and this led to the detection of the
CIB at these two wavelengths.

=== Fluctuation studies ===

Since the CIB is an accumulated light of individual sources there is always a somewhat different number of sources in different directions in the field of view of the observer. This cause a variation (fluctuation) in the total amount of observed incoming flux among the different line of sights. These fluctuations are traditionally described by the two dimensional [[autocorrelation function]], or by the corresponding [[Fourier analysis|Fourier]] [[power spectrum]]. The detection of fluctuations is easier than the direct CIB measurements, since one does not need to determine the absolute photometric zero point - fluctuations can be derived from differential measurements. On the other hand, fluctuations do not provide an immediate information on the CIB brightness. The measured fluctuation amplitudes either has to be confronted with a CIB model that has a prediction for the fluctuation / absolute level ratio, or it has to be compared with integrated differential light levels of [[source counts]] at the same wavelength.

The power spectrum of the CIB is usually presented in a spatial frequency [arcmin&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;] vs. fluctuation power [Jy&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;] diagram. It is contaminated by the presence of the power spectrum of foreground components, so that the total power spectrum is:

''P(f) = Φ(f)x[P&lt;sub&gt;CIB&lt;/sub&gt;(f) + P&lt;sub&gt;cirr&lt;/sub&gt;(f) + P&lt;sub&gt;ze&lt;/sub&gt;(f) + P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(f)]''

where P(f), P&lt;sub&gt;CIB&lt;/sub&gt;(f), P&lt;sub&gt;cirr&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;ze&lt;/sub&gt;(f) and P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(f) are the total, CIB, [[infrared cirrus|Galactic cirrus]], zodiacal emission and noise (instrument noise) power spectrum components, respectively, and Φ is the power spectrum of the telescope's [[point spread function]].

For most of the infrared zodiacal emission fluctuation are negligible in the "cosmic windows", far from the [[ecliptic]] plane.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | author = P. Ábrahám

| volume=328|year=1997|pages=702–705|bibcode = 1997A&amp;A...328..702A
|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the far-infrared the CIB power spectrum can be effectively used to separate it from its strongest foreground, the Galactic cirrus emission. The cirrus emission has a characteristic power spectrum of a power-law (that of a [[fractal]] spatial structure) ''P(f) = P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(f/f&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;'', where ''P'' is the fluctuation power at the spatial frequency ''f'', ''P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the fluctuation power at the reference spatial frequency ''f&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', and α is the spectral index. α was found to be α≈-3, which is much steeper than the power spectrum of the CIB at low spatial frequencies. The cirrus component can be identified in the power spectrum at low spatial frequencies and then removed from the whole spatial frequency range. The remaining power spectrum - after a careful correction for instrument effects - should be that of the CIB.

Autocorrelation and power spectrum studies resulted in the CIB fluctuation amplitudes at 1.25, 2.2, 3.5, 12-100μm based on the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]]/DIRBE measurements, and later at 90 and 170μm, based on the observations of the ISOPHOT instrument of the [[Infrared Space Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;

|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Source counts ===
[[Source counts]] gives the most extensive picture about the sources building up the CIB. In a [[source count]] one tries to detect as many point/compact sources in a certain field of view as possible: this is usually done at multiple wavelengths and is often complemented by other data, e.g. photometry at visual or sub-millimeter wavelengths. In this way, one has information on the broad band spectral characteristics of the detected sources, too. The detected point sources have to be distinguished from other contaminating sources, e.g. minor bodies in the Solar System, Galactic stars and cirrus knots (local density enhancements in the Galactic cirrus emission).

Source counts were important tasks for the recent infrared missions like [[2MASS]] or the [[Infrared Space Observatory]] (ISO), and is still one of the most important questions the current and near future infrared space instruments (the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] and the [[Herschel Space Observatory]]). While ISO was able to resolve about 3-10% of the total CIB light into individual sources (depending on the wavelength), Spitzer measurements have already detected ~30% of the CIB as sources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = H. Dole | title = Far-infrared Source Counts at 70 and 160 Microns in Spitzer Deep Surveys

 | doi = 10.1086/422472| bibcode=2004ApJS..154...87D|arxiv = astro-ph/0406021
|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this ratio is expected to be ~90% at some wavelengths with the [[Herschel Space Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | author = G. Lagache 
| title = Modeling infrared galaxy evolution using a phenomenological approach

|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Source count results support the "fast evolution" galaxy models. In these models galaxies nowadays look significantly different than they were at z=1...2, when they were coming through an intense star-formation phase. The source count results exclude the "steady state" scenarios, where z=1...2 galaxies look similar to those we see today in our cosmic neighborhood.

'''Edgar Morin''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɔː|ˈ|r|æ|n}}; {{IPA-fr|mɔʁɛ̃|lang}}; born '''Edgar Nahoum''' on 8 July 1921) is a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]] and [[sociologist]] who has been internationally recognized for his work on complexity and "complex thought" ([[:fr:Pensée complexe|pensée complexe]]), and for his scholarly contributions to such diverse fields as media studies, politics, sociology, visual anthropology, ecology, education, and systems biology. He holds degrees in history, economics, and law. Though less well known in the United States due to the limited availability of English translations of his over 60 books, Morin is renowned in the French-speaking world, Europe, and Latin America.

== Biography ==
At the beginning of the 20th century, Morin's family migrated from the Greek city of [[Salonica]] (Thessaloniki) to [[Marseille]]&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Morin, Véronique Nahoum-Grappe, Haïm Vidal Sephiha (1989), ''Vidal et les siens'', Paris: Seuil.&lt;/ref&gt; and later to [[Paris]], where Edgar was born. He is of Judeo-Spanish ([[Sephardi Jews|Sefardi]]) origin.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

When the Germans invaded France in 1940, Morin assisted refugees and joined the French Resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morin|first1=Edgar|last2=Boukhardi|first2=Sophie|title=Talking to Edgar Morin: Defining dialogue|journal=UNESCO: The New Courier|date=January 2004|pages=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of the [[French Resistance]] he adopted the pseudonym ''Morin'', which he would use for the rest of his life. He joined the [[French Communist Party]] in 1941.

In 1945, Morin married Violette Chapellaubeau and they lived in [[Landau]], where he served as a lieutenant in the French Occupation army in Germany.

In 1946, he returned to Paris and gave up his military career to pursue his activities with the Communist Party. Due to his critical posture, his relationship with the party gradually deteriorated until he was expelled in 1951 after he published an article in ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]''. In the same year, he was admitted to the National Center of Scientific Research ([[CNRS]]).

Morin founded and directed the magazine ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Arguments (journal)|fr|3=Arguments|lt=Arguments}}'' (1954–1962). In 1959 his book ''Autocritique'' was published. The book was a sustained reflection on his adherence to, and subsequent exit from, the Communist Party, focusing on the dangers of ideology and self-deception.

In 1960, Morin travelled extensively in Latin America, visiting [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]] and [[Mexico]]. He returned to France, where he published ''L'Esprit du Temps'', a work on popular culture''.''

That same year, French sociologist [[Georges Friedmann]] brought him and [[Roland Barthes]] together to create a Centre for the Study of Mass Communication that, after several name changes, became the [[Edgar Morin Centre]] of the [[EHESS]], Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=iiac |title=Centre Edgar-Morin |url=http://www.iiac.cnrs.fr/cetsah/spip.php?article207 |accessdate=2010-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023005003/http://www.iiac.cnrs.fr/cetsah/spip.php?article207 |archivedate=October 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1960 Morin and [[Jean Rouch]] coauthored the film [[Chronique d'un été]], an early example of ''[[cinéma vérité]]'' and [[Direct Cinema|direct cinema]].

Beginning in 1965, Morin became involved in a large multidisciplinary project, financed by the Délégation Générale à la Recherche Scientifique et Technologique in [[Plozévet]].

In 1968, Morin replaced [[Henri Lefebvre]] at the [[University of Paris X: Nanterre|University of Nanterre]]. He became involved in the student revolts that began to emerge in France. In May 1968 he wrote a series of articles for [[Le Monde]] that tried to understand what he called "The Student Commune." He followed [[May 1968 in France|the student revolt]] closely and wrote a second series of articles in Le Monde called "The Revolution without a Face," as well as coauthoring ''Mai 68: La brèche'' with [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] and [[Claude Lefort]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Herpen |first=Marcel |title =PARIS MAY '68 AND PROVO AMSTERDAM '65 |url =http://www.cicerofoundation.org/lectures/Marcel_Van_Herpen_May_68_and_Provo_Amsterdam_65.pdf | pages=19 |accessdate =2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Morin spent a year at the [[Salk Institute|Salk Institute for Biological Studies]] in [[La Jolla]], California. [[Jonas Salk]] invited him under the recommendation of [[Jacques Monod]] and John Hunt, with the sole imposed condition of learning. It was there, in this "breeding ground for Nobel Prizes" that he familiarized himself with systems theory. He read [[Henri Laborit]], [[James Watson]], [[Stéphane Lupasco]], [[Bronowski]], and was introduced to the thought of [[Gregory Bateson]] and the "new problematic in ecology".&lt;ref&gt;"Penser avec Edgar Morin, Lire La Méthode", Robin Fortin, Presses de l'Université Laval.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 he published ''De la nature de l’URSS,'' which deepened his analysis of Soviet communism and anticipated the [[perestroika]] of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].

In 2002 Morin participated in the creation of the [[Collegium International|International Ethical, Scientific and Political Collegium]]. Also that year, he made a trip to Iran with Dariush Shayegan.

==Work==
In addition to being the [[UNESCO]] Chair of Complex Thought, Morin is known as a founder of [[transdisciplinarity]] and holds honorary doctorates in a variety of social science fields from 21 universities (Messina, Geneva, Milan, Bergamo, Thessaloniki, La Paz, Odense, Perugia, Cosenza, Palermo, Nuevo León, Université de Laval à Québec, Brussels, Barcelona, Guadalajara, Valencia, Vera Cruz, Santiago, the Catholic University of Porto Alegre, the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, and Candido Mendes University (Rio de Janeiro)).&lt;ref name=Montuori&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Montuori|first1=Alfonso|title=COMPLEX THOUGHT An Overview of Edgar Morin's Intellectual Journey|journal=MetaIntegral Foundation|date=June 2013|volume=Resource Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Messina]] in Sicily, Ricardo Palma University in Lima, and the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)]], the French National Research Center in Paris, have established research centers based on his transdisciplinary methods and philosophy.&lt;ref name=Montuori/&gt; In addition, the [[Multiversidad Mundo Real Edgar Morin]], a university based on his work, was established in Mexico. Morin did not embrace the French [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] or [[poststructuralist]] movements, instead pursuing his own research agenda. As a result, US academics did not transport his theories into disciplinary discourses in same fashion as they did Foucault's and Derrida's. Morin's work spans scholarly and popular literature, and he has appeared on the cover of multiple publications including [http://www.scienceshumaines.com/edgar-morin-l-aventure-d-une-pensee_fr_497.htm Sciences Humaines] and a special issue of [http://boutique.lemonde.fr/le-monde-hors-serie-edgar-morin.html Le Monde].

According to Alfonso Montuori in "Edgar Morin: A partial introduction" &lt;blockquote&gt; "The 6 volume Method is perhaps Morin’s culminating work, a remarkable and seemingly inexhaustible treasure trove of insights, reflection, and a real manual for those who are interested in broadening the nature of human inquiry. Drawing on [[cybernetics]], [[information theory]], [[systems theory]], but also integrating all the work he has done before, from the work on imagination in his research on movies to his profound reflections on death, Method integrates Morin’s journey and provides the reader with an alternative to the traditional assumptions and method of inquiry of our time."

The '''''Escadron de transport, d'entraînement et de calibration''''' 00.065 (ETEC 65, "Transportation, training and calibration squadron") is a unit of the [[French Air Force]], under direct command of the [[Minister of Defence (France)|Minister of Defence]], in charge of the transportation of the [[President of France|President]], the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] and other French government officials.

==History==
In July 1945, the '''GAEL''' (groupe aérien d'entraînement et de liaison) was created. It was first based at [[Paris – Le Bourget Airport|Le Bourget Airport]], then relocated to the [[Vélizy – Villacoublay Air Base|Villacoublay Air Base]].

In 1969, the GAEL was split in two units, then in 1984 in three units.

In 1991, the three units were merged again into the l'ETEC 00.065 (escadron de transport, d'entraînement et de calibration), which was still called "GAEL".

In July 1995, the French president [[Jacques Chirac]] decided to disslove the Groupe de Liaisons Aériennes Ministérielles (GLAM). The GLAM's aircraft were transferred to the ETEC.

==Aircraft==
The ETEC uses 
* 1 Airbus [[A330-200]], Registration: F-RARF&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airfleets.net/flottecie/French%20Air%20Force-active-a330.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2 [[Falcon 7X]]
* 2 Falcon 900 (soon to be replaced),
* 2 Falcon 50 (soon to be replaced by 4 [[Falcon 2000|Falcon 2000LX]] ),
* 7 [[TBM 700]],
* 3 [[Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma|Super Puma]] helicopters (VIP-configured).

In 2003, the ETEC provided 673 flight hours for the President, 516 for the Prime Minister, 602 for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 318 for the Ministry of Defence. A flight hour typically costs: 
* €4050 for an Airbus, 
* €5750 for a Falcon 900 and 
* €4090 for a Falcon 50.

Flight are identified as  "COTAM 0xy", with the [[callsign]] "[[Cotam 001|COTAM 001]]" ("[[Cotam 001|COTAM Unité]]") being reserved for the President and "[[Cotam 002|COTAM 002]]" for foreign presidents.

In [[music]], an '''extension''' is a set of [[musical note]]s that lie outside the standard [[range (music)|range]] or [[tessitura]].

==Staff==
A note that lies outside the lines of a musical staff is an extension of the staff.  The note will lie on a [[ledger line]].  [[Middle C]] for example is an extension note on both treble and bass clefs, however is not outside the grand staff.  Soprano C and Deep C lie two ledger lines above treble and below bass respectively (as well as the [[grand staff]]).

==Instruments==
An instrumental extension is a range of playable notes outside the normal range of the instrument.  A [[baritone horn]], if played by a skillful player, can be played an octave above the normal range.  Since this isn't standard, these notes would be an extension. See also: [[Crook (music)]]. With the bowed string instruments, lower pitches than the standard range are sometimes used through [[scordatura]] in which the lowest string is tuned down a note or two. The double bass sometimes uses a [[Double bass#Tuning|C extension]] extending the range of the E string downwards to C. Some [[Bösendorfer]] pianos have extra keys, extending the range several notes lower than a standard 88-key piano.

==Voice==
In vocal performance, a singer's extension is all notes that are a part of the singer's vocal range that lie outside the singer's [[tessitura]].  This usually include notes that a singer can hit, but doesn't use on a regular basis. For example, a [[coloratura]] [[soprano]] regularly, as defined by range, will sing in the [[whistle register]]. A standard [[mezzo-soprano]] has a range to the high F or G above [[middle C]], however a [[mezzo-soprano|mezzo]] with good head voice extension can rival the [[coloratura]] [[soprano]] in range. However, since her normal [[tessitura]] is [[mezzo-soprano]] (or under [[Soprano C]]), her abilities in the whistle register would be considered her extension.

Although not commonly thought of, extension can be applied to the lower register as well.  A baritone may actually be able to reach depths of low D or E below low C, but is more comfortable in the higher [[baritone]] [[tessitura]]. A special class of soprano, the [[soprano sfogato]], while retaining the high notes characteristic of the soprano vocal range, may be able to hit down to E3 using the chest voice. Due to dearth of true contraltos, usually mezzo-sopranos with strong low extension are employed instead in roles such as ''Ulrica'' in Verdi's [[Un ballo in maschera]].

For men, their vocal extension upwards is usually co-terminus{{Jargon-inline|date=January 2017}} with his [[falsetto]], unless they are a [[countertenor]], barbershop tenor, or its equivalent in [[popular music]].

Uses of extensions include:
* providing an ''acuto'', i.e. an accented high note which may or may not be written in the score, e.g. in cadenzas, mad scenes etc.
* providing a cadence ''in acuti'', e.g. Eb6 at the end of ''Sempre libera'' in [[La traviata]] (which had in fact became a tradition if the soprano is able and the conductor allows it).
* ornamental purposes, usually in massive scale works, e.g. ''D'amor al dolce impero'' in Rossini's ''[[Armida (Rossini)|Armida]]''

[[File:Einstein gyro gravity probe b.jpg|thumb|320px|right|This fused quartz sphere was manufactured for use in a gyroscope in the [[Gravity Probe B]] experiment. It is one of the most accurate spheres ever manufactured, deviating from a perfect sphere by no more than 40 atoms of thickness. Only [[neutron star]]s are thought to be smoother.]]

'''Fused quartz''' or '''fused silica''' is [[glass]] consisting of [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] in [[amorphous solid|amorphous]] (non-[[crystal]]line) form.  It differs from traditional [[Soda-lime glass|glasses]] in containing no other ingredients, which are typically added to glass to lower the melt temperature. Although the terms quartz and fused silica are used interchangeably, the fundamental structures and creation of each glass differ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.swiftglass.com/quartz-vs-fused-silica-whats-the-difference/|title=Quartz vs. Fused Silica: What’s the Difference?|last=|first=|date=2015-09-08|work=Swift Glass|access-date=2017-08-18|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fused silica, therefore, has high working and melting temperatures.  The optical and thermal properties of fused quartz are superior to those of other types of glass due to its purity.  For these reasons, it finds use in situations such as [[semiconductor]] fabrication and laboratory equipment. It transmits [[ultraviolet]] better than other glasses, so is used to make [[lens (optics)|lenses]] and optics for the ultraviolet spectrum. Its low [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] also makes it a useful material for precision mirror substrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1002/14356007.a12_365 |chapter=Glass |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |year=2000 |last1=De Jong|first1=Bernard H. W. S. |last2=Beerkens |first2=Ruud G. C. |last3=Van Nijnatten|first3=Peter A. |isbn=3-527-30673-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacture ==

Fused quartz is produced by [[Melting|fusing]] (melting) high-purity silica sand, which consists of [[quartz]] crystals. There are four basic types of commercial silica glass:
* Type I is created by the electric melting of natural quartz in a vacuum, or in an inert gas at low pressure.
* Type II is the result of quartz crystal powder by flame fusion.
* Type III is a synthetic variety; it is produced by the hydrolyzation of SiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; when sprayed into an OH flame.
* Type IV is a synthetic produced from SiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in a water vapor-free plasma flame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seas.ucla.edu/~pilon/Publications/AO2007-1.pdf|title=Optical constants of silica glass from extreme ultraviolet to far infrared at near room temperature|last=Kitamura|first=Rei|date=2007-09-25|website=UCLA Engineering|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Quartz contains only silicon and oxygen, although commercial quartz glass often contains impurities. The most dominant impurities are [[aluminium]] and [[titanium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraeus-quarzglas.de/en/quarzglas/chemicalpurity/Chemical_purity.aspx ''Chemical purity of fused quartz / fused silica''], www.heraeus-quarzglas.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fusion==

Melting is effected at approximately 1650°C  (3000°F) using either an electrically heated furnace (electrically fused) or a gas/oxygen-fuelled furnace (flame-fused).  Fused silica can be made from almost any [[silicon]]-rich chemical precursor, usually using a continuous process which involves flame [[oxidation]] of volatile silicon compounds to silicon dioxide, and thermal fusion of the resulting dust (although alternative processes are used). This results in a transparent glass with an ultra-high purity and improved optical transmission in the deep ultraviolet. One common method involves adding [[silicon tetrachloride]] to a hydrogen–oxygen flame, but this precursor results in environmentally unfriendly byproducts{{CN|date=August 2018}} including [[chlorine]] and [[hydrochloric acid]].

==Product quality==

Fused quartz is normally transparent.  The material can, however, become translucent if small air bubbles are allowed to be trapped within.  The water content (and therefore infrared transmission of fused quartz and fused silica) is determined by the manufacturing process. Flame-fused material always has a higher water content due to the combination of the hydrocarbons and oxygen fuelling the furnace, forming [[hydroxyl]] [OH] groups within the material. An IR grade material typically has an [OH] content of &lt;10 parts per million.

==Applications==
Most of the applications of fused silica exploit its wide transparency range, which extends from the UV to the near IR. Fused silica is the key starting material for [[optical fiber]], used for telecommunications.

Because of its strength and high melting point (compared to ordinary [[glass]]), fused silica is used as an envelope for [[halogen lamp]]s and [[high-intensity discharge lamp]]s, which must operate at a high envelope temperature to achieve their combination of high brightness and long life. Vacuum tubes with silica envelopes allowed for [[radiation cooling]] by incandescent anodes.

Because of its strength, fused silica was used in deep diving vessels such as the [[bathysphere]] and [[benthoscope]].

The combination of strength, thermal stability, and UV transparency makes it an excellent substrate for projection masks for [[photolithography]]. 

[[File:EPROM Intel C1702A.jpg|thumb|An [[EPROM]] with fused quartz window in the top of the package]]
Its UV transparency also finds uses in the semiconductor industry; an [[EPROM]], or erasable programmable [[read only memory]], is a type of memory [[integrated circuit|chip]] that retains its data when its power supply is switched off, but which can be erased by exposure to strong ultraviolet light. EPROMs are recognizable by the transparent fused quartz window which sits on top of the package, through which the [[silicon]] chip is visible, and which permits exposure to [[UV light]] during erasing.

Due to the thermal stability and composition, it is used in semiconductor fabrication furnaces.

Fused quartz has nearly ideal properties for fabricating [[first surface mirror]]s such as those used in [[telescope]]s.  The material behaves in a predictable way and allows the optical fabricator to put a very smooth polish onto the surface and produce the desired figure with fewer testing iterations. In some instances, a high-purity UV grade of fused quartz has been used to make several of the individual uncoated lens elements of special-purpose lenses including the Zeiss 105mm f/4.3 UV Sonnar, a lens formerly made for the Hasselblad camera, and the Nikon UV-Nikkor 105mm f/4.5 (presently sold{{clarification needed|reason=this lens is no longer manufactured by Nikon|date=May 2014}} as the Nikon PF10545MF-UV) lens. These lenses are used for UV photography, as the quartz glass has a lower extinction rate than lenses made with more common [[Flint glass|flint]] or [[Crown glass (optics)|crown]] glass formulas.

Fused quartz can be metallised and etched for use as a substrate for high-precision microwave circuits, the thermal stability making it a good choice for narrowband filters and similar demanding applications. The lower [[dielectric constant]] than alumina allows higher impedance tracks or thinner substrates. 

Fused quartz is also the material used for modern glass instruments such as the [[glass harp]] and the [[verrophone]], and is also used for new builds of the historical [[glass harmonica]]. Here, the superior strength and structure of fused quartz gives it a greater dynamic range and a clearer sound than the historically used [[lead crystal]].

===Refractory material applications===
Fused silica as an industrial raw material is used to make various refractory shapes such as crucibles, trays, shrouds, and rollers for many high-temperature thermal processes including [[steelmaking]], [[investment casting]], and glass manufacture.  Refractory shapes made from fused silica have excellent thermal shock resistance and are chemically inert to most elements and compounds, including virtually all acids, regardless of concentration, except [[hydrofluoric acid]], which is very reactive even in fairly low concentrations. Translucent fused-silica tubes are commonly used to [[Quartz heater|sheathe electric elements in room heaters]], industrial furnaces, and other similar applications.

Owing to its low mechanical damping at ordinary temperatures, it is used for [[Q factor|high-Q]] resonators, in particular, for [[Vibrating_structure_gyroscope#Wine-glass_resonator|wine-glass resonator]] of hemispherical resonator gyro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sensorsmag.com/sensors/acceleration-vibration/an-overview-mems-inertial-sensing-technology-970 An Overview of MEMS Inertial Sensing Technology], February 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Penn|first1=Steven D.|last2=Harry|first2=Gregory M.|last3=Gretarsson|first3=Andri M.|last4=Kittelberger|first4=Scott E.|last5=Saulson|first5=Peter R.|last6=Schiller|first6=John J.|last7=Smith|first7=Joshua R.|last8=Swords|first8=Sol O.|title=High quality factor measured in fused silica|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|volume=72|issue=9|pages=3670|year=2001|doi=10.1063/1.1394183|arxiv=gr-qc/0009035|bibcode=2001RScI...72.3670P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quartz glassware is occasionally used in chemistry laboratories when standard [[borosilicate glass]] cannot withstand high temperatures or when high UV transmission is required. The cost of production is significantly higher, limiting its use; it is usually found as a single basic element, such as a tube in a furnace, or as a flask, the elements in direct exposure to the heat.

==Physical properties==
The extremely low coefficient of thermal expansion, about 5.5×10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;/°C (20–320°C), accounts for its remarkable ability to undergo large, rapid temperature changes without cracking (see [[thermal shock]]).

[[Image:Fused silica phosphorescence from a 24 million watt flash.jpg|thumb|300px|Phosphorescence in fused quartz from an extremely intense pulse of ultraviolet light, centered at 170 nm, in a flashtube]]
Fused quartz is prone to [[phosphorescence]] and "[[solarisation (physics)|solarisation]]" (purplish discoloration) under intense UV illumination, as is often seen in [[flashtube]]s. "UV grade" synthetic fused silica (sold under various tradenames including "HPFS", "Spectrosil", and "Suprasil") has a very low metallic impurity content making it transparent deeper into the ultraviolet. An optic with a thickness of 1&amp;nbsp;cm has a transmittance around 50% at a [[wavelength]] of 170&amp;nbsp;nm, which drops to only a few percent at 160&amp;nbsp;nm. However, its infrared transmission is limited by strong [[water absorption]]s at 2.2 μm and 2.7 μm.

"Infrared grade" fused quartz (tradenames "Infrasil", "Vitreosil IR", and others), which is electrically fused, has a greater presence of metallic impurities, limiting its UV transmittance wavelength to around 250&amp;nbsp;nm, but a much lower water content, leading to excellent infrared transmission up to 3.6 μm wavelength. All grades of transparent fused quartz/fused silica have nearly identical physical properties.

==Optical properties==
The [[Dispersion (optics)|optical dispersion]] of fused silica can be approximated by the following [[Sellmeier equation]]:&lt;ref name=m&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malitson|first1=I.

The name derives from the experiment's magnetization transfer pathway: The magnetization of the amide proton of an [[Amino acid|amino acid residue]] is transferred to the amide nitrogen, and then to the alpha carbons of both the starting residue and the previous residue in the protein's amino acid sequence. In contrast, the complementary [[HNCOCA]] experiment
transfers magnetization only to the alpha carbon of the previous residue{{ref|hnca}}. The HNCA experiment is used, often in tandem with HNCOCA, to assign alpha carbon resonance signals to specific residues in the protein. This experiment requires a purified sample of protein prepared with [[Carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] and [[Nitrogen-15|&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N]] [[Isotopic labeling|isotopic labelling]], at a concentration greater than 0.1 [[Concentration#Molarity|mM]], and is thus generally only applied to [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant proteins]].

The spectrum produced by this experiment has 3 dimensions: A proton axis, a &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N axis and a &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C axis. For residue i peaks will appear at {H&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;(i), N(i), C&lt;sub&gt;alpha&lt;/sub&gt; (i)} and {H&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;(i), N(i), C&lt;sub&gt;alpha&lt;/sub&gt;(i-1)}, while for the complementary [[HNCOCA]] experiment peaks appear only at {H&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;(i), N(i), C&lt;sub&gt;alpha&lt;/sub&gt;(i-1)}. Together, these two experiments reveal the alpha carbon chemical shift for each amino acid residue in a protein, and provide information linking adjacent residues in the protein's sequence.

'''Human ecosystems''' are [[complex system|complex cybernetic systems]] that are increasingly being used by [[ecological]] [[anthropologists]] and other scholars to examine the ecological aspects of human communities in a way that integrates multiple factors as economics, socio-political organization, psychological factors, and physical factors related to the environment.

The decorations of the vault over the nave date back to the 17th century. The fresco is the work of Giovanni Battista Gaulli, known as Baciccia. The stucco reliefs were executed by Ercole Antonio Raggi and Leonardo Reti, following the drawings of Baciccia who wanted to effect a real continuity between painting and sculpture.]]

'''Illusionism''' in [[art history]] means either the artistic tradition in which artists create a work of art that appears to share the physical space with the viewer&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;"Illusionism," ''Grove Art Online''. [[Oxford University Press]], [accessed 17 March 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; or more broadly the attempt to represent physical appearances precisely – also called [[mimesis]].  The term [[realism (art)|realist]] may be used in this sense, but that also has rather different meanings in art, as it is also used to cover the choice of ordinary everyday subject-matter, and avoiding idealizing subjects. Illusionism encompasses a long history, from the deceptions of [[Zeuxis and Parrhasius]] to the works of [[mural]]ist [[Richard Haas]] in the twentieth century, that includes [[trompe-l'oeil]], [[anamorphosis]], [[Op art]], [[Abstract Illusionism]], and [[Illusionistic ceiling painting]] techniques such as ''di sotto in sù'' and ''quadratura''.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt; [[sculpture|Sculptural]] illusionism includes works, often painted, that appear real from a distance.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt; Other forms, such as the [[illusionistic tradition]] in the theatre, and [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]]'s "peepshow"-boxes from the seventeenth century, combine illusionistic techniques and media. 

==Illusionistic realism==

[[File:Frederic Leighton - Cimabue's Madonna Carried in Procession - Google Art Project 2.jpg|thumb|left|340px|[[Lord Leighton]]'s ''Cimabue's Madonna Carried in Procession'' of 1853-55 is at the end of a long tradition of illusionism in painting, but is not Realist in the sense of Courbet's work of the same period.]]
The development of increasingly accurate representation of the visual appearances of things has a long history in art. It includes elements such as the accurate depiction of the anatomy of humans and beasts, of [[graphical perspective|perspective]] and effects of distance, and of detailed effects of light and colour. The [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic]] in Europe achieved remarkably lifelike depictions of beasts, and [[Ancient Egyptian art]] developed conventions involving both [[stylization]] and idealization that nevertheless allowed very effective depictions to be produced very widely and consistently. [[Ancient Greek art]] is commonly recognised as having made great progress in the representation of anatomy, and has remained an influential model ever since. No original works on panels or walls by the great Greek painters survive, but from literary accounts, and the surviving corpus of derivative works (mostly Graeco-Roman works in [[mosaic]]) it is clear that illusionism was highly valued in painting. [[Pliny the Elder]]'s famous story of birds pecking at grapes painted by [[Zeuxis]] in the 5th century BC may well be a legend, but indicates the aspiration of Greek painting. As well as accuracy in shape, light and colour, Roman paintings show an unscientific but effective knowledge of representing distant objects smaller than closer ones, and representing regular geometric forms such as the roof and walls of a room with perspective.  This progress in illusionistic effects in no way meant a rejection of idealism; statues of Greek gods and heroes attempt to represent with accuracy idealized and beautiful forms, though other works, such as heads of the famously ugly [[Socrates]], were allowed to fall below these ideal standards of beauty. [[Roman portraiture]], when not under too much Greek influence, shows a greater commitment to a truthful depiction of its subjects.

[[File:Camera picta, ceiling 3.jpg|alt=Illusionistic ceiling fresco by Andrea Mantegna in the Camera degli Sposi, Ducal Palace, Mantua|left|thumb|[[Andrea Mantegna]]'s late-[[Quattrocento]] ceiling fresco in the ''[[Camera degli Sposi]]''  (commissioned by [[Ludovico III Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua|Ludovico III Gonzaga]] for Mantua's Ducal Palace) is an early example of [[illusionistic ceiling painting]].]]
The art of [[Late Antiquity]] famously rejected illusionism for expressive force, a change already well underway by the time Christianity began to affect the art of the elite. In the West classical standards of illusionism did not begin to be reached again until the [[Late medieval]] or [[Early Renaissance]] period, and were helped by the development of new techniques of [[oil painting]] which allowed very subtle and precise effects of light to be painted using very small brushes and several layers of paint and glaze.  Scientific methods of representing perspective were developed in Italy and gradually spread across Europe, and accuracy in anatomy rediscovered under the influence of classical art. As in classical times, idealism remained the norm.

The accurate depiction of [[landscape painting|landscape in painting]] had also been developing in Early Netherlandish and Renaissance painting, and was then brought to a very high level in 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], with very subtle techniques for depicting a range of weather conditions and degrees of natural light. After being another development of Early Netherlandish painting, by 1600 European portraiture could give a very good likeness in both painting and sculpture, though the subjects were often idealized by smoothing features or giving them an artificial pose. [[Still life]] paintings, and still life elements in other works, played a considerable role in developing illusionistic painting, though in the Netherlandish tradition of flower painting they long lacked "realism", in that flowers from all seasons were typically used, either from the habit of assembling compositions from individual drawings, or as a deliberate convention; the large displays of [[Flower bouquet|bouquet]]s in vases, though close to modern displays of cut flowers that they have influenced, were entirely atypical of 17th-century habits, where flowers were displayed one at a time.  Intriguingly, having led the development of illusionic painting, still life was to be equally significant in its abandonment in [[Cubism]].

==Donald Judd==


In his writings and art criticisms during the mid-1960s [[art critic]]/artist [[Donald Judd]] claimed that illusionism in painting undermined the artform itself. Judd implied that painting was dead, claiming painting was a ''lie'' because it depicted the ''illusion'' of three-dimensionality on a flat surface. Judd claimed that painting needed to recognize its objecthood in real space and reject illusion. Donald Judd wrote in “Specific Objects” in 1965:
{{quote|Three dimensions are real space. That gets rid of the problem of illusionism and of literal space, space in and around marks of color… Actual space is intrinsically more powerful and specific than paint on a flat surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynrail.org/2011/07/artseen/donald-judd Greg Lindquist, The Brooklyn Rail, ''Donald Judd'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Modern Illusion==
In the Webster Texas Holiday Inn, close to the Houston Space Center, there is a double illusion ceiling by muralist Frank Wilson, commissioned in honor of US astronauts. Other double illusion murals exist in rooms for officials as well as the dining room, depicting a night sky under darkness and illuminated by glowing minerals.  Under normal light, clouds and birds are observed.

'''Immunogenetics''' or '''immungenetics''' is the branch of [[medical genetics]] that explores the relationship between the [[immune system]] and [[genetics]].

Autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, are complex genetic traits which result from defects in the immune system. Identification of genes defining the immune defects may identify new target genes for therapeutic approaches. Alternatively, genetic variations can also help to define the immunological pathway leading to disease.

==Origin==
Its origin is usually attributed to [[Edward Jenner]], who discovered in 1796 that [[cowpox]], or vaccinia, induced protection against human [[smallpox]].
It took two centuries before the [[World Health Organization]] announced in 1979 that smallpox had been [[eradication of smallpox|eradicated]].

The term immunogenetics is based on the two words [[immunology]] and [[genetics]], and is defined as "a sub-category of genetics focussing on the genetic basis of the immune reaction" according to MeSH.
Genetics (based on Greek γενεά ''geneá'' "descent" and γένεσις ''génesis'' "origin") is the science researching the transfer of characteristics from one generation to the next. The genes of an organism (strands of DNA) and the transfer of genes from the parent to the child generation of an organism in the scope of possible variations are the basis of genetics.

Immunology deals with the biological and biochemical basis for the body's defense against germs (such as [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, and [[Mycosis|fungi]]), as well as against foreign agents such as biological toxins and environmental pollutants, and failures and malfunctions of these defence mechanisms. Apart from these external effects on the organism, there are also defence reactions regarding the body's own cells, e.g. in the scope of the bodily reactions on cancer and the lacking reaction of a body on healthy cells in the scope of an immune-mediated disease. Hence, immunology is a sub-category of [[biology]].

The term immunogenetics comprises all processes of an organism, which are, on the one hand, controlled and influenced by the genes of the organism, and are, on the other hand, significant with regard to the immunological defence reactions of the organism.

==History==

The medical history of [[immunology]] and the [[immune system]] dates back to the 19th century. However, the prevention and early defence of diseases was an essential task for all shamans, medicine men and early "doctors" during the entire human evolution. The first Nobel Prize in the field of immunogenetics was awarded to [[Baruj Benacerraf]], [[Jean Dausset]] and [[George Davis Snell]] in 1980 for discovering genetically determined cellular surface structures, which control immunological reactions.

==Current research fields==
In the last 20 years,{{When|date=September 2012}} research activities focussed on a large number of different questions in immunogenetics. Both the acceleration of and the decreasing costs for the sequencing of the genes have resulted in a more intensive research of both academic and commercial working groups. Current research topics particularly deal with forecasts on the course of diseases and therapy recommendations due to genetic dispositions and how these dispositions can be affected by agents (gene therapy).

A special focus is often laid on the forecast regarding and therapy of genetically based [[autoimmune disease]]s, which include all diseases caused by an extreme reaction of the immune system against the body's own tissue. By mistake, the immune system recognises the body's own tissue as a foreign object which is to be fought. This can result in serious inflammatory reactions which may permanently damage the respective organs. Autoimmune diseases, the outbreak and/or course of which can be visible in the individual genome of the organism, include [[multiple sclerosis]], [[diabetes type I]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[Crohn's disease]]. As for multiple sclerosis, an article in the journal ''Nature'' dated May 2010 (Baranzini et al.: Genome, epigenome and RNA sequences of [[monozygotic twin]]s discordant for multiple sclerosis. Nature 2010, 464; S. 1351-1356 – for link see below) showed that this autoimmune disease is not caused by a genetic variation but the course and the treatability are considerably influenced by genetic dispositions. This research was based on analysing three monovular pairs of twins, of which one twin has contracted multiple sclerosis whereas the other one has not.

The '''Law of Maximum''' also known as '''Law of the Maximum''' is a principle developed by [[Arthur Wallace]] which states that total growth of a crop or a plant is proportional to about 70 growth factors. Growth will not be greater than the aggregate values of the growth factors. Without the correction of the limiting growth factors; nutrients, waters and other inputs are not fully or judicially used resulting in wasted resources.&lt;ref&gt;

== Applications ==

The growth factors are arithmetically additive. The factors range from 0 for no growth to 1 for maximum growth. Actual growth is calculated by the total multiplication of each growth factor. For example, if ten factors had a value of 0.5, the actual growth would be:

{|
|
*0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 x0.5 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 or 0.001 of optimum (0.1%).
|}

If each of ten factors had a value of 0.9 the actual growth would be:
{|
|
*0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 x0.9 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 or 0.349 of optimum (34.9%).
|}

Hence the need to achieve maximal value for each factor is critical in order to obtain maximal growth.

== Demonstrations of "Law of the Maximum" ==

The following demonstrates the Law of the Maximum. For the various crops listed below, one, two or three factors were limiting while all the other factors were 1. When two or three factors were simultaneously limiting, predicted growth of the two or three factors was similar to the actual growth when the two or three factors were limits individually and then multiplied together.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3633">'''Leen Ritmeyer''' is a Dutch-born [[Archaeology|archaeological]] [[architect]] who currently lives and works in Wales, after having spent 22 years (1967–89) in Jerusalem.

==Career==
Ritmeyer holds an M.A. in Conservation Studies from the Institute of Advanced Architectural Studies, [[University of York]], England, and a Ph.D. from the [[University of Manchester]], England.

Beginning in 1973, Ritmeyer served for 10 years as official architect of the archaeological dig at the [[Southern Wall]] of the [[Temple Mount]] directed by [[Benjamin Mazar]].&lt;ref name=ShanksLost&gt;"How We Lost the Temple Mount," [[Hershel Shanks]], [[Moment (magazine)]], June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritmeyer is known for the "solid scientific research" he has done on the archaeology and architecture of the [[Temple Mount]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="autogenerated78"&gt;Gershom Gorenberg, ''The End of Days'' (Oxford: OUP, 2002), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered archaeological evidence for the location of [[Solomon's Temple]], the emplacement of the [[Ark of the Covenant]] on the [[Foundation Stone]],&lt;ref&gt;'[http://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-06/local/me-21736_1_temple-mount Architect Claims He Has Pieced Together Old Biblical Puzzle]' in [[Los Angeles Times]], Jan 6, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and the location of the platform as extended in the [[First Temple]] period, probably during the time of [[Hezekiah]] described as a square of 500 [[cubit]]s in ''[[Mishnah]] [[Middot (Talmud)|Middot]]'' 2.1.  He has demonstrated that one of the steps leading to the [[Dome of the Rock]] is actually the top of a remaining stone course of the pre-[[Herodian dynasty|Herodian]] [[Western Wall]] of the Temple Mount platform.&lt;ref name="autogenerated78"/&gt;

Ritmeyer is known for his architectural models of the buildings of ancient Jerusalem. His [[Replicas of the Jewish Temple|models of the historical Jewish Temples]] have been exhibited at museums including the [[Yeshiva University Museum]] in New York&lt;ref&gt;[http://spider.mc.yu.edu/news/articles/article.cfm?id=101578]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501145218/http://spider.mc.yu.edu/news/articles/article.cfm?id=101578 |date=May 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Siegfried Horn|Siegfried H. Horn]] Museum at [[Andrews University]], Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrews.edu/archaeology/museum/history.html |title=Siegfried H. Horn Museum - Andrews University |publisher=Andrews.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Ritmeyer has published several books, some together with his wife, Kathleen, including:
* ''Jerusalem at the Time of Jesus''
* ''The Ritual of the Temple in the Time of Christ''
* ''Secrets of Jerusalem's Temple Mount'' (1998) 
* ''Jerusalem in the Year 30 AD''
* ''Jerusalem in the Time of Nehemiah''
* ''The Quest: Revealing the Temple Mount in Jerusalem''&lt;ref name=Cline&gt;[[Eric H. Cline]],  ''The Quest'' (book review), [[Biblical Archaeology Review]], "Revealing the Temple Mount in Jerusalem," 12 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''From Sinai to Jerusalem: The Wanderings of the Holy Ark''&lt;ref name=Sivan&gt;"Getting serious about the Ark of the Covenant," Gabriel A. Sivan (book review), [[Jerusalem Post]], 21 July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Temple and the Rock''

The [[NIST Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures]] is a reference work maintained by the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]].
It defines a large number of '''terms relating to algorithms and data structures'''. For algorithms and data structures not necessarily mentioned here, see [[list of algorithms]] and [[list of data structures]].

This list of terms was originally derived from the index of that document, and is in the public domain, as it was compiled by a Federal Government employee as part of a Federal Government work.
Some of the terms defined are:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4040">'''''Many Voices One World''''', also known as the '''MacBride report''', was a 1980 [[UNESCO]] publication written by the '''International Commission for the Study of Communication Problems''', chaired by [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[Nobel laureate]] [[Seán MacBride]]. Its aim was to analyze communication problems in modern societies, particularly relating to mass media and news, consider the emergence of new technologies, and to suggest a kind of communication order ([[New World Information and Communication Order]]) to diminish these problems to further peace and human development. 

Among the problems the report identified were concentration of the media, commercialization of the media, and unequal access to information and communication. The commission called for democratization of communication and strengthening of national media to avoid dependence on external sources, among others. Subsequently, Internet-based technologies considered in the work of the Commission, served as a means for furthering MacBride's visions.

While the report had strong international support, it was condemned by the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] as an attack on the freedom of the press, and both countries withdrew from UNESCO in protest in 1984 and 1985, respectively (and later rejoined in 2003 and 1997, respectively).

==The MacBride Commission==
The '''International Commission for the Study of Communication Problems''' was set up in 1977 by the director of UNESCO [[Ahmadou-Mahtar M’Bow]], under suggestion by the USA delegation. It was agreed that the commission would be chaired by Seán MacBride from Ireland and representatives from 15 other countries, invited  due to their roles in national and international communication activities and picked among media activists, journalists, scholars, and media executives.

The members of the MacBride Commission were:
* [[Elie Abel]] (USA)
* [[Hubert Beuve-Méry]] (France)
* [[Elebe Ma Ekonzo]] (Zaire)
* [[Gabriel García Márquez]] (Colombia)
* [[Sergei Losev (scientist)|Sergei Losev]] (Soviet Union)
* [[Mochtar Lubis]] (Indonesia)
* [[Mustapha Masmoudi]] (Tunisia)
* [[Michio Nagai]] (Japan)
* [[Fred Isaac Akporuaro Omu]] (Nigeria)
* [[Bogdan Osolnik]] (Yugoslavia)
* [[Gamal El Oteifi]] (Egypt)
* [[Jan Pronk|Johannes Pieter Pronk]] (Netherlands)
* [[Juan Somavía]] (Chile)
* [[Boobli George Verghese]] (India)
* [[Betty Zimmerman]] (Canada), in substitution of [[Marshal McLuhan]], then ill

The commission presented a preliminary report in October 1978 at the 20th General Conference of UNESCO in [[Paris]].  The Commission's seminal session on new technologies to address the identified problems, was hosted by India at [[New Delhi in March 1979]]. The final report was delivered to M’Bow in April 1980 and was approved by consensus in the 21st General Conference of UNESCO in [[Belgrade]]. The commission dissolved after presenting the report.

Because of controversy surrounding the report and the withdrawal of support by the UNESCO leadership in the 1980s for its ideas, the book went out of print and was difficult to obtain. A book on the history of the United States and UNESCO was even threatened with legal action and forced to include a disclaimer that UNESCO was in no way involved with it. The MacBride report was eventually reprinted by Rowman and Littlefield in the US, and is also freely available online.

Under [[thermal equilibrium]] the product of the [[Valence and conduction bands|free electron]] concentration &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and the free hole concentration &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is equal to a constant square of intrinsic carrier concentration &lt;math&gt;n_{i}&lt;/math&gt;. The intrinsic carrier concentration is a function of temperature.

The equation for the mass action law for [[semiconductor]]s is:&lt;ref name="JNTU"&gt;{{Cite book | last = S | first = Salivahanan |author2=N. Suresh Kumar | title = Electronic Devices &amp; Circuits | publisher = Tata McGraw Hill Education Pvt Ltd | year = 2011 | location = India | pages = 1.14 | isbn = 0-07-070267-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;np = n_{i}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Carrier concentrations==
In semiconductors, free electrons and [[electron hole|holes]] are the [[charge carrier|carriers]] that provide [[electrical conduction|conduction]]. For cases where the number of carriers are much less than the number of band states, the carrier concentrations can be approximated by using [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics|Boltzmann statistics]], giving the results below.

===Electron concentration===
The free electron concentration ''n'' can be approximated by
:&lt;math&gt;n=N_c\text{ exp}\left[-\frac{(E_c-E_F)}{kT}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
where 
* ''E''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the energy of the [[band diagram|conduction band]] 
* ''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the energy of the [[Fermi level]] 
* ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]]
* ''T'' is the temperature in Kelvin
* ''N''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the effective density of states at the conduction band edge given by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle N_c=2\left(\frac{2\pi m_e^*kT}{h^2}\right)^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;, with ''m*''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; being the electron [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] and ''h'' being the [[planck constant]].

===Hole concentration===
The free hole concentration ''p'' is given by a similar formula
:&lt;math&gt;p=N_v\text{ exp}\left[-\frac{(E_F-E_v)}{kT}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
where 
* ''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the energy of the [[Fermi level]] 
* ''E''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is the energy of the [[band diagram|valence band]] 
* ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]]
* ''T'' is the temperature in Kelvins 
* ''N''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is the effective density of states at the valence band edge given by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle N_v=2\left(\frac{2\pi m_h^*kT}{h^2}\right)^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;, with ''m*''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; being the hole [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] and ''h'' being the [[planck constant]].

===Mass action law===
Using the carrier concentration equations given above, the mass action law can be stated as
:&lt;math&gt;np = N_cN_v\text{ exp}\left(-\frac{E_g}{kT}\right) = n_i^2&lt;/math&gt;
where ''E''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; is the bandgap energy given by ''E''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''E''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Image:2008-07-28 Mast radiator.jpg|thumb|A typical mast radiator and "[[helix building|helix house]]" of an AM [[radio station]] in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]]. The high [[Radio frequency|RF]] [[voltage]] on the mast can deliver a dangerous [[electrical shock]] to anyone touching it, so the base is surrounded by a fence to prevent access.]]

A '''mast radiator''' (or '''radiating tower''') is a [[Radio masts and towers|radio mast or tower]] in which the entire structure functions as an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. This design, first used in radiotelegraphy stations in the early 1900s, is commonly used for [[Transmitter|transmitting]] antennas operating at low [[Frequency|frequencies]], in the [[Very low frequency|VLF]], [[Low frequency|LF]] and [[Mediumwave|MF]] ranges, in particular those used for AM [[broadcasting]]. The metal mast is electrically connected to the [[transmitter]]. Its base is usually mounted on a nonconductive support to insulate it from the ground.  A mast radiator is a form of [[monopole antenna]].

==Design considerations==
===Design===
[[Image:Radio antenna mast bonding strips.JPG|thumb|left|To ensure that the mast acts as a single conductor, the separate structural sections of the mast are connected electrically by copper jumpers or "fusion" (arc) welds across the mating flanges.]]
Most mast radiators are built as [[guyed mast]]s insulated from the ground at the base. Steel [[lattice mast]]s of triangular cross-section are the most common type. Square lattice masts and tubular masts are also sometimes used. To ensure that the tower is a continuous conductor, the tower's structural sections are electrically bonded at the joints by short copper jumpers which are soldered to each side.  

[[Image:Base feed.spliced.jpg|thumb|right|Base feed: [[Radio frequency]] power is fed to the mast by a wire attached to it, which comes from an [[Antenna tuner|antenna tuning unit]] inside the "[[helix building]]" at right.  The brown ceramic insulator at the base keeps the mast isolated from the ground.  On the left there is an earthing switch and a spark gap for lightning protection.]]
At its base, the mast is usually mounted on a thick ceramic insulator, which has the compressive strength to support the tower's weight and the dielectric strength to withstand the high RF voltage applied by the transmitter. The [[Radio frequency|RF]] power to drive the antenna is supplied by an [[antenna tuner]] unit, usually housed in a small building called a [[helix building]] next to the mast, and the cable supplying the current is simply bolted to the tower. The actual [[transmitter]] is usually located in a separate building, which supplies RF power to the helix building via a [[transmission line]].

[[image:Blosenbergturm.jpg|thumb|left|The Blosenbergturm in Beromünster, Switzerland - a radiating tower insulated against ground]]
Free-standing towers are also used as radiating structures. These towers can have a triangular or a square cross section, with each leg supported on an insulator. One of the best-known radiating towers is the [[Blosenbergturm]] in [[Beromünster]], [[Switzerland]]. [[Fiberglass]] masts are sometimes used for small constructions.

===Mast height===
The ideal height of a mast radiator depends on [[radio frequency|transmission frequency]], [[demographics]] for the location, and terrain. For radio systems in the [[longwave]] and [[mediumwave]] range, the value of the height should be in the range between one sixth and five eighths of the wavelength, with preferred values at the quarter or the half of the radiated wavelength. When this is not possible, masts with a [[loading coil]], 'capacity hat' or similar loading arrangement are used.

The height of the mast determines the radiation properties. For high power transmitters in the MW range, masts with heights around half of the radiated wavelength are preferred because they focus the radiated power better to the ground than structures with heights of quarter wavelengths, which are preferred for economical reasons for low power medium wave transmitters. A focus of radiated power towards the ground is much desired on frequencies below 3 [[megahertz]], because groundwave propagation is very stable. Masts longer than five eighths of the wavelength are normally not used, because they show bad vertical radiation patterns, so masts for mediumwave transmitters do not normally exceed 300 metres.  For [[longwave]] transmitters, however, the construction of masts with heights of half-wave wavelength is generally not economically viable and in most cases impossible. The only [[longwave]] radio mast with a height of the half length of the radiated wavelength was the [[Warszawa Radio Mast]] at [[Konstantynów (Płock County)|Konstantynów]], [[Poland]]. At the time of its collapse in 1991 it was the tallest manmade structure in the world, at 646.38 metres (2,120.67&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, for a wavelength of 1292.76 metres (frequency 232 kHz).  For frequencies below longwave, masts are electrically enlarged by [[loading coil]]s or capacity hats on the top, because masts of even quarter wavelength would be too high to be practical.

===Feed arrangements===
[[File:First mast radiator antenna Akron 1931.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The first mast radiator antenna, a 221 foot (67 m) tower built in 1931 in Akron, Ohio, as a transmitter for the Akron police department.  The inset ''(right)'' shows one of the four legs supported on insulators.]]
[[File:Johnny ball strain insulator.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Guy lines have egg-shaped strain insulators in them, to prevent the high voltage on the mast from reaching the ground]] 

There are three ways of feeding a mast radiator from a transmitter:
*Series excited: the mast is supported on an insulator, and the transmitter is connected to the mast just above it;
*Shunt excited: the mast is grounded and the transmitter feeds it via a wire connected to the mast part way up. (This is a similar approach, on a larger scale, to the 'gamma match' popular among [[amateur radio operator]]s for VHF and UHF [[amateur radio]] antennas.)
*Sectional: the structure is divided into usually two sections with insulators between, usually center-fed. This [[Collinear antenna array|collinear]] arrangement enhances low-angle (ground wave) radiation and reduces high-angle (sky wave) radiation. This increases the distance to the [[mush zone]] where the ground wave and sky wave are at similar strength at night. This type of antenna is known as an anti-fading aerial. Practical sectionals with 120 over 120 degrees, 180 over 120 degrees and 180 over 180 degrees are presently in operation with good results.

There is usually an antenna matching unit to match the impedance of the transmitter or feeder to the antenna. Depending on the power involved, this may be a small box or a hut or building. It will typically contain an [[L-network]] to transform the modulus of impedance, and a coil or capacitor in series with the mast connection to 'tune out' any reactive component.

===Location of transmission facility===
At some facilities, especially the older and higher-powered installations, the mast radiator may be located at some distance from the transmitter building, in order to reduce the field strength induced by the mast into the building, and to prevent the building from distorting the mast's radiation pattern. Between the transmitter building and the antenna matching unit next to the mast radiator, there is a feeder: either an underground coaxial cable or an overhead wire 'cage' feeder.

At facilities with multiple masts, spacings are typically smaller, in order to fit them into the available space.

At modern transmitters or at low power transmitters situated in very small [[transmitter building]]s the transmitter, matching unit and mast radiator can be very close together and even in the same building. This measure saves on feeders, land area and increases the efficiency of the transmitter if only one mast radiator is in use.

At most facilities the mast radiator is on a separate base close to the antenna matching unit, but it can be sometimes be placed on the roof of the antenna matching unit, for example at the main transmission mast of the [[Mühlacker radio transmitter]] and the main transmission mast of the [[Ismaning radio transmitter]].

For a good groundwave propagation, mast radiators are built on a large flat area with good ground conductivity and if possible without inclination. The construction of a mast radiator on the top of a building or tower whose height is in the same magnitude range as the wavelengths being transmitted gives a bad groundwave propagation. For this reason, mast radiators are (in contrast to FM broadcasting antennas) not typically installed on the top of buildings or towers. Nevertheless in rare cases, mast radiators for low power transmissions are installed on top of buildings. Some lighthouses, such as [[Reykjanesviti]] carry a mast radiator for a longwave radio beacon on the roof. The best-known are [[WGSO#Transmitter|WGSO]] in [[New Orleans]] and [[KSBN (AM)]] on the [[Delaney Building]] in [[Spokane, Washington]]. In Europe, the low-power broadcasting station at [[Campobasso Transmitter|Campobasso]] uses a mast radiator on a castle.

===Fencing===
Mast radiators, as with all other equipment showing over 42 volts on exposed components within 4 metres of the ground, are required to be fenced in.  Usually a chain-link fence is used, but sometimes wooden fences are used in order to prevent signal interference, which could occur due to currents induced by radio signals in metallic fences.
If the mast radiator is mounted on the top of the helix building, which must be over four metres in height; or the mast is grounded, with the feed being located not less than four metres above the ground, a fence is not required.
Nevertheless it is always recommended to fence in any mast radiator in order to prevent unauthorized climbing.

===Ancillary connections===
A mast radiator may need various electrical connections other than the transmitter [[feed line]]. Such connections include static drain chokes (which drain off static charges caused by wind, clouds, etc.), spark-gap balls for lightning protection, power supplies for [[aircraft warning lights|aircraft warning lamps]], and coaxial feeders for ancillary antennas mounted on the mast. A variety of techniques are used to 'isolate' these connections from the high [[Radio frequency|RF]] voltage on the mast, such as [[Choke (electronics)|chokes]], [[parallel circuit|parallel tuned circuits]] and coupling loops, on a base-fed mast. On a shunt-fed mast, where the base is grounded, such measures are unnecessary.

==Anti-fading antennas==
[[Image:Hamersley radio mast closeup.jpg|thumb|Capacitive "top hat" on mast is occasionally used for [[electrical lengthening]], to allow a shorter mast to be electrically resonant.]]

An anti-fading antenna (informally and often incorrectly termed a "Franklin" antenna) is a long- and medium-wave transmission antenna with a flat vertical radiation pattern. The design goal is to move the [[mush zone]] farther from the transmitter site. An anti-fading antenna will reduce radiation at elevations of more than 50 degrees as much as possible. In principle, such a radiator should be as thin as possible, although thicker radiators improve the bandwidth and contribute to a taller effective height.

These antennas are usually constructed using a metal radio mast, which is fed both at its base and at an appropriate height. The radio mast is usually insulated from ground and is divided electrically by a separation insulator into two parts. For feeding of the upper part, either a cable inside the mast construction or the ladder, which must be mounted on insulators, is used. This design is employed in the [[transmitter Muehlacker|Mühlacker]], [[Rheinsender|Wolfsheim]] and [[transmitter Hamburg-Billstedt|Hamburg]] medium-wave transmitters. Anti-fading antennas with two separation insulators are installed at [[transmitter Ismaning|Ismaning]].

Because separation insulators are fragile compared to the construction of the radio mast framework, horizontal forces, such as those generated by wind-caused oscillations, need to be minimized. Radio masts with built-in separation insulators may employ oscillation dampers just above the separation insulator. This approach is used on the radio masts of [[Rheinsender|Wolfsheim]], [[transmitter Hamburg-Billstedt|Hamburg]] and [[transmitter Ismaning|Ismaning]].

A simple anti-fading antenna is a vertical radiator whose height is between 1/2 wavelength (180 electrical degrees) and 5/9 wavelength (200 degrees), 195 degrees being considered ideal. 200 degree and taller simple radiators have largely fallen into disuse, although these can be useful on medium power stations, in which case radiators as tall as 5/8 wavelength (225 degrees) are somewhat common. Any simple radiator (or array of radiators) which is taller than 195 degrees is generally not considered to have anti-fading properties.

A more complex anti-fading antenna is a vertical radiator which is sectionalized and is one wavelength (360 degrees, generally 180 over 180 degrees, and historically and correctly termed a "Franklin" radiator; two in an array at [[KFBK (AM)|KFBK]]), or 300 degrees (180 over 120 degrees, and formally called a [[WHO (AM)|WHO]] radiator), or 240 degrees (120 over 120 degrees, and formally called a [[WOAI (AM)|WOAI]] radiator, but WOAI has since replaced this with a 195 degree radiator for lower maintenance cost at the expense of somewhat poorer "fringe" reception). Several have been incorporated into phased arrays (directional antennas). When so sectionalized the sections are themselves phased so as to provide the optimum vertical radiation pattern (suppressing high-angle radiation). An advantage of the 180 over 180 degree configuration is no ground radial system is required, and the bottom of the lower section may be insulated from the ground; for the others, the bottom of the lower section is usually connected to a ground radial system through a capacitor.

Another form of anti-fading mast antenna is a circular array antenna, in which a number of mast radiators are arranged on a circle and fed in equal phase. With this design, very flat radiation patterns may be produced, although they are very expensive since multiple radio masts are required. [[Taldom transmitter]] and [[Tulagino transmitter]] in Russia are currently the only radio stations in the world using such antennas. At one time, [[longwave transmitter Orlunda]] in Sweden also used an antenna of this type.

==Records==
The tallest mast radiator ever built was the [[Warsaw radio mast]] at Konstantynow, Poland. The antenna was {{convert|648.38|m|ft}} high but collapsed in 1991. Currently the masts of the [[Lualualei VLF transmitter]], at {{convert|458.11|m|ft}}, are the tallest mast radiators insulated against ground. In contrast to the Warsaw Radio Mast, the Lualualei antenna uses extensive [[electrical lengthening]] measures. The tallest mast radiator not using electrical lengthening may be the [[Longwave radio mast Hellissandur|Hellissandur longwave radio mast]] at {{convert|411.48|m|ft}} high.

The '''McCarthy 91 function''' is a [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive function]], defined by the [[computer scientist]] [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] as a test case for [[formal verification]] within [[computer science]].

The McCarthy 91 function is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;M(n)=\begin{cases}
 n - 10, &amp; \mbox{if }n &gt; 100\mbox{ } \\
 M(M(n+11)), &amp; \mbox{if }n \le 100\mbox{ }
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The results of evaluating the function are given by ''M''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;91 for all integer arguments ''n''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;100, and ''M''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;10 for ''n'' &amp;gt; 100. Indeed, the result of M(101) is also 91 (101 - 10 = 91). All results of M(n) after n = 101 are continually increasing by 1, e.g. M(102) = 92, M(103) = 93.

==History==
The 91 function was introduced in papers published by [[Zohar Manna]], [[Amir Pnueli]] and [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] in 1970.  These papers represented early developments towards the application of [[formal methods]] to [[formal verification|program verification]].  The 91 function was chosen for being nested-recursive (contrasted with [[single recursion]], such as defining &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; by means of &lt;math&gt;f(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;).  The example was popularized by Manna's book, ''Mathematical Theory of Computation'' (1974). As the field of Formal Methods advanced, this example appeared repeatedly in the research literature.
In particular, it is viewed as a "challenge problem" for automated program verification.

It is easier to reason about [[tail recursion|tail-recursive]] control flow, this is an equivalent ([[extensionality|extensionally equal]]) definition:
:&lt;math&gt;Mt(n)= Mtaux(n,1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Mtaux(n, c)=\begin{cases}
 n, &amp; \mbox{if }c = 0\\
 Mtaux(n-10, c-1), &amp; \mbox{if }n &gt; 100\mbox{ and } c \ne 0 \\
 Mtaux(n+11, c+1), &amp; \mbox{if }n \le 100\mbox{ and } c \ne 0
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
As one of the examples used to demonstrate such reasoning, Manna's book includes a tail-recursive algorithm equivalent to the nested-recursive 91 function. Many of the papers that report an "automated verification" (or [[termination proof]]) of the 91 function only handle the tail-recursive version.

This is an equivalent [[mutual recursion|mutually]] tail-recursive definition:
:&lt;math&gt;Mmt(n)= Mmtaux(n,0)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Mmtaux(n,c)=\begin{cases}
 Mmtaux2(n-10,c), &amp; \mbox{if }n &gt; 100\mbox{ } \\
 Mmtaux(n+11,c+1), &amp; \mbox{if }n \le 100\mbox{ }
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Mmtaux2(n,c)=\begin{cases}
 n, &amp; \mbox{if }c = 0\mbox{ } \\
 Mmtaux(n,c-1), &amp; \mbox{if }c \ne 0\mbox{ }
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
A formal derivation of the mutually tail-recursive version from the nested-recursive one was given in a 1980 article by [[Mitchell Wand]], based on the use of [[continuation]]s.

==Examples==
Example A:

 M(99) = M(M(110)) since 99 ≤ 100
       = M(100)    since 110 &gt; 100
       = M(M(111)) since 100 ≤ 100
       = M(101)    since 111 &gt; 100
       = 91        since 101 &gt; 100

Example B:

 M(87) = M(M(98))
       = M(M(M(109)))
       = M(M(99))
       = M(M(M(110)))
       = M(M(100))
       = M(M(M(111)))
       = M(M(101))
       = M(91)
       = M(M(102))
       = M(92)
       = M(M(103))
       = M(93)
    .... Pattern continues increasing till M(99), M(100) and M(101), exactly as we saw on the example A)
       = M(101)    since 111 &gt; 100
       = 91        since 101 &gt; 100

==Code==
Here is an implementation of the nested-recursive algorithm in [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]]:

&lt;source lang="lisp"&gt;
 (defun mc91 (n)
   (cond ((&lt;= n 100) (mc91 (mc91 (+ n 11))))
         (t (- n 10))))
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is an implementation of the nested-recursive algorithm in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
  mc91 n 
    | n &gt; 100   = n - 10
    | otherwise = mc91 $ mc91 $ n + 11
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is an implementation of the nested-recursive algorithm in [[OCaml (programming language)|OCaml]]:

&lt;source lang="ocaml"&gt;
  let rec mc91 n =
    if n &gt; 100 then n - 10
    else mc91 (mc91 (n + 11))
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is an implementation of the tail-recursive algorithm in [[OCaml (programming language)|OCaml]]:

&lt;source lang="ocaml"&gt;
  let mc91 n =
    let rec aux n c =
      if c = 0 then n
      else if n &gt; 100 then aux (n - 10) (c - 1)
      else aux (n + 11) (c + 1)
    in
    aux n 1
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is an implementation of the nested-recursive algorithm in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]:

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
 def mc91(n):
    if n &gt; 100:
        return n - 10
    else:
        return mc91(mc91(n + 11))
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is an implementation of the nested-recursive algorithm in [[C (programming language)|C]]:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
 int mc91(int n)
 {
     if( n &gt; 100 ) {
         return n - 10;
     } else {
         return mc91(mc91(n+11));
     }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is an implementation of the tail-recursive algorithm in [[C (programming language)|C]]:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
 int mc91(int n)
 {
     mc91taux(n, 1);
 }

 int mc91taux(int n, int c)
 {
     if( c != 0 ) {
         if( n &gt; 100 ) {
             return mc91taux(n - 10, c - 1);
         } else {
             return mc91taux(n + 11, c + 1);
         }
     } else {
         return n;
     }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==Proof==
Here is a proof that the function is equivalent to non-recursive:
:&lt;math&gt;M(n)=\begin{cases}
 n - 10, &amp; \mbox{if }n &gt; 100\mbox{ } \\
 91, &amp; \mbox{if }n \le 100\mbox{ }
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

For 90 ≤ ''n'' &amp;lt; 101,

 M(n) = M(M(n + 11))
      = M(n + 11 - 10), where n + 11 &gt;= 101 since n &gt;= 90
      = M(n + 1)

So ''M''(''n'') = 91 for 90 ≤ ''n'' &amp;lt; 101.

We can use this as a base case for [[Inductive proof|induction]] on blocks of 11 numbers, like so:

Assume that ''M''(''n'') = 91 for ''a'' ≤ ''n'' &amp;lt; ''a'' + 11.

Then, for any ''n'' such that ''a'' - 11 ≤ ''n'' &amp;lt; ''a'',

 M(n) = M(M(n + 11))
      = M(91), by hypothesis, since a ≤ n + 11 &lt; a + 11
      = 91, by the base case.

Now by induction ''M''(''n'') = 91 for any ''n'' in such a block. There are no holes between the blocks, so ''M''(''n'') = 91 for ''n'' &amp;lt; 101. We can also add ''n'' = 101 as a special case.

== Knuth's generalization ==

[[Donald Knuth]] generalized the 91 function to include additional parameters. [[John Cowles]] developed a formal proof that Knuth's generalized function was total, using the [[ACL2]] theorem prover.

'''MusicMaster''' is a music scheduling software produced by A-Ware Software (aka MusicMaster, Inc. of Dallas, Texas USA) and used by radio, Internet and television stations.&lt;ref name="musicmasteroverview"&gt;[http://www.mmwin.com/software/overview.php MusicMaster for Windows :: Custom Music Scheduling Software System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225160854/http://www.mmwin.com/software/overview.php |date=2009-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their main office is located in [[Dallas, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboutus.org/A-ware.com A-Ware.com - AboutUs Wiki Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
MusicMaster was created in 1983 by Joseph Knapp, an engineer, [[radio programmer]] and on-air personality for several stations in Ohio and Wisconsin, [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicmaster.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Knapp believed that the decision-making process of selecting music for airplay could best be done using computers. In 1983, Knapp began writing a program he called ''Revolve'', meant to improve the rotation of songs for airplay. Previously, music scheduling had been done by hand, as [[disc jockeys]] selected a song card from the front of a stack, played the track, and returned the card to the back of the stack to ensure that it was equally rotated with all available songs. With the use of computers, better decisions could be made based on a set of programmable rules. For instance, the rule of artist separation would ensure that two songs by the same artist needed to be separated by a given amount of time.

After selling the first copy of MusicMaster to WCXI-FM/Detroit, Knapp rewrote the program for the Radio Shack [[TRS-80]] and then for the [[IBM personal computer|IBM PC]]. By 1985, it was licensed for distribution by Tapscan and sold as MusicScan. When a legal dispute ended A-ware's relationship with Tapscan in 1994, Knapp formed his own company and distributed the program as MusicMaster. In 2001, MusicMaster was ported to [[Microsoft Windows]].

==Overview==
The heart of MusicMaster is a music [[database]], which is custom built to the user's specifications.&lt;ref name=musicmasteroverview /&gt; This database can include information such as song title, artist, [[trivia]], and any other information the user needs to identify each song. The users can also add attributes to each song to identify the type, [[era]], [[tempo]], mood and other factors that will be used by MusicMaster to control the flow, balance and mix of the scheduled [[playlists]] using scheduling rules. The user creates rules based on these attributes using MusicMaster's Rule Tree system.

The user assigns the songs to any number of different categories. These Categories are then requested in specific times and patterns throughout the day using any number of Format Clocks. The Categories allow some songs to rotate, or repeat, more often than others in the library. Usually, the newer and more popular songs are heard more often, while the older established hits are heard less frequently.

In addition to scheduling rules, MusicMaster also offers an Optimum Goal Scheduling system that selects the best possible song based on a combination of weighted scores. These scores are a measure of the variance from the calculated ideal music rotation as indicated by the rotational mathematics of the music library and Format Clock assignments. The song closest to "perfect" is the one selected for airplay in each position on the playlist. Users can export the MusicMaster playlists to files that are compatible with most radio and television automation systems, such as [[WideOrbit's WO Automation for Radio]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wideorbit.com/wideorbit-products/wo-automation-for-radio/]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as many popular media players.

The balance and rotation of non-music elements, such as [[jingle]]s and sweepers, are also controlled by MusicMaster. Users can automatically match sweepers and jingles to specific song attributes such as artist, tempo, or genre.

MusicMaster also offers a Nexus Server that allows third-party developers to directly access and update the MusicMaster scheduling intelligence, database, and playlists through their own software systems for real-time synchronization of data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rwonline.com/pages/s.0108/t.12696.html A-Ware Software Has MusicMaster Nexus Server&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcast software products such as traffic and billing, research analysis and web services may use the Nexus Server to interact directly with a MusicMaster database.

In April 2016, MusicMaster introduced MusicMaster CS, a client-server based version of their popular music scheduling system.  The complete product line also includes MusicMaster Solo Edition, designed for individual radio stations in small markets, and MusicMaster Personal Edition, perfect for hobby Internet broadcasters, retail background music, and personal entertainment.

In September 2016, A-Ware Software relocated to Dallas, Texas. With that move, the corporate name was officially changed to MusicMaster, Inc.. The company maintained the original name, A-Ware Software, as a Texas corporate alias.  The corporate headquarters are located at 8330 Lyndon B Johnson Freeway, Suite B1050, Dallas, Texas, USA 75243. The main phone number is 469-717-0100.

==Clientele==
MusicMaster currently generates schedules for radio stations all over the world, as well as music television networks, satellite broadcasters, and cable television channels, Internet streams, syndicated programs, restaurants and nightclubs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plaympe.com/v3/partners/radiocompanies.php Play MPE: Press Resources&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Age''' is a term applied to a range of [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[religion|religious]] beliefs and practices that developed in [[Western culture|Western nations]] during the 1970s. Precise scholarly definitions of the New Age differ in their emphasis, largely as a result of its highly [[eclecticism|eclectic]] structure. Although analytically often considered to be religious, those involved in it typically prefer the designation of '''spiritual''' or '''Mind, Body, Spirit''' and rarely use the term "New Age" themselves. Many scholars of the subject refer to it as the '''New Age movement''', although others contest this term and suggest that it is better seen as a [[milieu]] or [[zeitgeist]].

&lt;!--History of the New Age--&gt;
As a form of [[Western esotericism]], the New Age drew heavily upon a number of older esoteric traditions, in particular those that emerged from the occultist current that developed in the eighteenth century. Such prominent occult influences include the work of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] and [[Franz Mesmer]], as well as the ideas of [[Spiritualism]], [[New Thought]], and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. A number of mid-twentieth century influences, such as the [[UFO religions]] of the 1950s, the [[Counterculture of the 1960s]], and the [[Human Potential Movement]], also exerted a strong influence on the early development of the New Age. The exact origins of the phenomenon remain contested, but there is general agreement that it developed in the 1970s, at which time it was centred largely in the United Kingdom. It expanded and grew largely in the 1980s and 1990s, in particular within the United States. By the start of the 21st century, the term "New Age" was increasingly rejected within this milieu, with some scholars arguing that the New Age phenomenon had ended.  

&lt;!--Core Beliefs--&gt;
Despite its highly eclectic nature, a number of beliefs commonly found within the New Age have been identified. [[Theology|Theologically]], the New Age typically adopts a belief in a [[Holism|holistic]] form of divinity that imbues all of the universe, including human beings themselves. There is thus a strong emphasis on the spiritual authority of the self. This is accompanied by a common belief in a wide variety of semi-divine non-human entities, such as [[angel]]s and [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|masters]], with whom humans can communicate, particularly through the form of [[Mediumship#Channeling|channeling]]. Typically viewing human history as being divided into a series of distinct ages, a common New Age belief is that whereas once humanity lived in an age of great technological advancement and spiritual wisdom, it has entered a period of spiritual degeneracy, which will be remedied through the establishment of a coming [[Age of Aquarius]], from which the milieu gets its name. There is also a strong focus on healing, particularly using forms of [[alternative medicine]], and an emphasis on a New Age "science" that seeks to unite science and spirituality.

&lt;!--Sociological factors--&gt;
Centred primarily in Western countries, those involved in the New Age have been primarily from middle and upper-middle-class backgrounds. The degree to which New Agers are involved in the milieu varied considerably, from those who adopted a number of New Age ideas and practices to those who fully embraced and dedicated their lives to it. The New Age has generated criticism from established Christian organisations as well as [[Modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] and [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous communities]]. From the 1990s onward, the New Age became the subject of research by academic scholars of [[religious studies]].

==Definitions==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="One of the few things on which all scholars agree concerning New Age is that it is difficult to define. Often, the definition given actually reflects the background of the scholar giving the definition. Thus, the New Ager views New Age as a revolutionary period of history dictated by the stars; the Christian apologist has often defined new age as a cult; the historian of ideas understands it as a manifestation of the perennial tradition; the philosopher sees New Age as a monistic or holistic worldview; the sociologist describes New Age as a new religious movement (NRM); while the psychologist describes it as a form of narcissism."|source=— Scholar of religion Daren Kemp, 2004.{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=1}} }}

The New Age phenomenon has proved difficult to define,{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=2001|1p=363|2a1=Kemp|2y=2004|2p=1|3a1=Granholm|3y=2013|3p=59}} with much scholarly disagreement as to its scope.{{sfn|Granholm|2013|p=59}} The scholars Steven J. Sutcliffe and Ingvild Sælid Gilhus have even suggested that it remains "among the most disputed of categories in the study of religion".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|Gilhus|2013|p=1}}

The scholar of religion [[Paul Heelas]] characterised the New Age as "...an eclectic hotch-potch of beliefs, practices, and ways of life" that can be identified as a singular phenomenon through their use of "...the same (or very similar) ''[[lingua franca]]'' to do with the human (and planetary) condition and how it can be [[Spiritual transformation| transformed]]."{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=1–2}} Similarly, the historian of religion [[Olav Hammer]] termed it "a common denominator for a variety of quite divergent contemporary popular practices and beliefs" that have emerged since the late 1970s and are "largely united by historical links, a shared discourse and an ''air de famille''".{{sfn|Hammer|2006|p=855}} According to Hammer, this New Age was a "fluid and fuzzy [[cult]]ic milieu".{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=14}} The [[Sociology of religion|sociologist of religion]] [[Michael York (religious studies scholar)|Michael York]] described the New Age as "...an umbrella term that includes a great variety of groups and identities" that are united by their "...expectation of a major and universal change being primarily founded on the individual and collective development of human potential."{{sfn|York|1995|pp=1–2}}

The scholar of religion [[Wouter Hanegraaff]] adopted a different approach by asserting that "New Age" was "a ''label'' attached indiscriminately to whatever seems to fit it" and that as a result it "means very different things to different people".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=1}} He thus argued against the idea that the New Age could be considered "a unified ideology or ''[[World view|Weltanschauung]]''",{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=515}} although he believed that it could be considered a "more or less unified 'movement'."{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=522}} Conversely, various other scholars have suggested that the New Age is insufficiently homogenous to be regarded as a singular ''movement''.{{sfnm|1a1=Bruce|1y=1998|1p=24|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=9|3a1= Chryssides|3y=2007|3p=22}} As a replacement term, the sociologist of religion Steven Bruce suggested that New Age was better seen as a [[milieu]],{{sfn|Bruce|1998|p=24}} while scholar of religion [[George D. Chryssides]] suggested that it could be understood as "a counter-cultural ''Zeitgeist''".{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=22}}

There is no central authority within the New Age phenomenon that can determine what counts as New Age and what does not.{{sfn|York|2001|p=364}}
Many of those groups and individuals who could analytically be categorised as part of the New Age reject the term "New Age" in reference to themselves.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1992|1pp=1–2|2a1= Heelas|2y=1996|2p=17|3a1=York|3y=2001|3p=364|4a1= Sutcliffe|4y=2003a|4p=200|5a1=Partridge|5y=2004|5p=2|6a1=MacKian|6y=2012|6p=5}} Some even express active hostility to the term.{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=177}} Rather than terming themselves "New Agers", those involved in this milieu commonly describe themselves as spiritual "seekers",{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=200}} and some self-identify as a member of a different religious group, such as Christianity, Judaism, or Buddhism.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=25}} In 2003 Sutcliffe observed that the use of the term "New Age" was "optional, episodic and declining overall", adding that among the very few individuals who did use it, they usually did so with qualification, for instance by placing it in quotation marks.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=197}} Other academics, such as Sara MacKian, have argued that the sheer diversity of the New Age renders the term too problematic for scholars to use.{{sfnm|1a1=Chryssides|1y=2007|1p=10|2a1=MacKian|2y=2012|2p=7}} MacKian proposed "everyday spirituality" as an alternate term.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=12}}

While acknowledging that "New Age" was a problematic term, the scholar of religion  [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]] stated that it remained a useful [[etic]] category for scholars to use because, "There exists no comparable term which covers all aspects of the movement."{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=2}} Similarly, Chryssides argued that the fact that "New Age" is a "theoretical concept" does not "undermine its usefulness or employability"; he drew comparisons with "[[Hinduism]]", a similar "western etic piece of vocabulary" that scholars of religion used despite its problems.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=13}}

===Religion, spirituality, and esotericism===

In discussing the New Age, academics have varyingly referred to "New Age spirituality" and "New Age religion".{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=1}} Those involved in the New Age rarely consider it to be "religion"—negatively associating that term solely with [[organized religion]]—and instead describe their practices as "spirituality".{{sfnm|1a1=Sutcliffe|1y=2003a|1pp=214–215|2a1= Partridge|2y=2004|2p=48}} Religious studies scholars, however, have repeatedly referred to the New Age milieu as a "religion".{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=243|2a1= Partridge|2y=2004|2p=38}} York described the New Age as a [[new religious movement]] (NRM).{{sfn|York|1995|p=2}} Conversely, both Heelas and Sutcliffe rejected this categorisation;{{sfnm|1a1= Heelas|1y=1996|1p=9|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=200}} Heelas believed that while elements of the New Age represented NRMs, this did not apply to every New Age group.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=9}} Similarly, Chryssides stated that the New Age could not be seen as "a religion" in itself.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=19}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="The New Age movement is the cultic milieu having become conscious of itself, in the later 1970s, as constituting a more or less unified "movement". All manifestations of this movement are characterized by a popular western culture criticism expressed in terms of a secularized esotericism."|source=— Scholar of esotericism Wouter Hanegraaff, 1996.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=522}} }}

The New Age is also a form of [[Western esotericism]].{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=1995|1p=33|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=400|3a1=Hammer|3y=2001|3p=9}} Hanegraaff regarded the New Age as a form of "popular culture criticism", in that it represented a reaction against the dominant Western values of [[Judeo-Christian]] religion and rationalism,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=331}} adding that "New Age religion formulates such criticism not at random, but falls back on" the ideas of earlier Western esoteric groups.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=515}}

The New Age has also been identified by various scholars of religion as part of the [[cultic milieu]].{{sfnm|1a1= Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=522|2a1= Hammer|2y=2001|2p=28|3a1= Chryssides|3y=2007|3p=17}} This concept, developed by the sociologist [[Colin Campbell (sociologist)|Colin Campbell]], refers to a social network of marginalised ideas. Through their shared marginalisation within a given society, these disparate ideas interact and create new syntheses.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|pp=28–29}}

Hammer identified much of the New Age as corresponding to the concept of "[[folk religions]]" in that it seeks to deal with [[existential]] questions regarding subjects like death and disease in "an unsystematic fashion, often through a process of [[bricolage]] from already available narratives and rituals".{{sfn|Hammer|2006|p=855}} York also heuristically divides the New Age into three broad trends. The first, the ''social camp'', represents groups that primarily seek to bring about social change, while the second, the ''occult camp'', instead focus on contact with spirit entities and channeling. York's third group, the ''spiritual camp'', represents a middle ground between these two camps that focuses largely on [[self-development | individual development]].{{sfn|York|1995|pp=36–37}}

===Terminology===

The term ''new age'', along with related terms like ''new era'' and ''new world'', long predate the emergence of the New Age movement, and have widely been used to assert that a better way of life for humanity is dawning.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=15}} It occurs commonly, for instance, in political contexts; the [[Great Seal of the United States]], designed in 1782, proclaims a "new order of ages", while in the 1980s the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] proclaimed that "all mankind is entering a new age".{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=15}} The term has also appeared within Western esoteric schools of thought, having a scattered use from the mid-nineteenth century onward.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=25}}  In 1864 the American [[Swedenborgian]] [[Warren Felt Evans]] published ''The New Age and its Message'', while in 1907 [[Alfred Orage]] and [[Holbrook Jackson]] began editing a weekly journal of [[Liberal Christianity|Christian liberalism]] and [[socialism]] titled ''[[The New Age]]''.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=17}} The concept of a coming "new age" that would be inaugurated by the [[Second Coming | return to Earth]] of [[Jesus Christ]] was a theme in the poetry of [[Wellesley Tudor Pole]] and [[Johanna Brandt]],{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=26}} and then also appeared in the work of the American Theosophist [[Alice Bailey]], who used the term prominently in such titles as ''Disciplineship in the New Age'' (1944) and ''Education in the New Age'' (1954).{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=26}}

Between the 1930s and 1960s a small number of groups and individuals became preoccupied with the concept of a coming "New Age" and prominently used the term accordingly.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=55}} The term had thus become a recurring motif in the esoteric spirituality milieu.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=99}}
Sutcliffe therefore expressed the view that while the term "New Age" had originally been an "apocalyptic emblem", it would only be later that it became "a tag or codeword for a 'spiritual' idiom".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=29}}

==History==

===Antecedents===
{{double image|right|Helena Petrovna Blavatsky.jpg|141|CGJung.jpg|140|Prominent esoteric thinkers who influenced the New Age include [[Helena Blavatsky]] (left) and [[Carl Jung]] (right)}}

According to scholar [[Nevill Drury]], the New Age has a "tangible history",{{sfn|Drury|2004|p=10}} although Hanegraaff expressed the view that most New Agers were "surprisingly ignorant about the actual historical roots of their beliefs".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=323}} Similarly, Hammer thought that "source amnesia" was a "building block of a New Age worldview", with New Agers typically adopting ideas with no awareness of where those ideas originated.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=180}}

As a form of Western esotericism,{{sfn|York|1995|p=33}} the New Age has antecedents that stretch back to southern Europe in [[Late Antiquity]].{{sfn|Ellwood|1992|p=59}} Following the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in 18th century Europe, new esoteric ideas developed in response to the development of scientific rationality. Scholars call this new esoteric trend ''[[occultism]]'', and this occultism was a key factor in the development of the worldview from which the New Age emerged.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=406–407}}

One of the earliest influences on the New Age was the Swedish 18th century [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]] [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], who professed the ability to communicate with angels, demons, and spirits. Swedenborg's attempt to unite science and religion and his prediction of a coming era in particular have been cited as ways that he prefigured the New Age.{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1p=31|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=424–429|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=42}} Another early influence was the late 18th and early 19th century German physician and [[hypnotist]] [[Franz Mesmer]], who claimed the existence of a force known as "[[animal magnetism]]" running through the human body.{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1p=31|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=430–435|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=41}} The establishment of [[Spiritualism]], an occult religion influenced by both Swedenborgianism and Mesmerism, in the U.S. during the 1840s has also been identified as a precursor to the New Age, in particular through its rejection of established Christianity, its claims to representing a scientific approach to religion, and its emphasis on channeling spirit entities.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=435|2a1=Pike|2y=2004|2p=24|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=37}}

A further major influence on the New Age was the [[Theosophical Society]], an occult group co-founded by the Russian [[Helena Blavatsky]] in the late 19th century. In her books ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'' (1877) and ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' (1888), Blavatsky claimed that her Society was conveying the essence of all world religions, and it thus emphasized a focus on [[comparative religion]].{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1p=31|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=448–455|3a1=Pike|3y=2004|3p=24|4a1=Kemp|4y=2004|4p=39}} Serving as a partial bridge between Theosophical ideas and those of the New Age was the American esotericist [[Edgar Cayce]], who founded the [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]].{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=1995|1p=60|2a1=Hammer|2y=2001|2p=66}} Another influence was [[New Thought]], which developed in late nineteenth century [[New England]] as a Christian-oriented healing movement before spreading throughout the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1p=35|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=455–462|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=38}} Another prominent influence was the psychologist [[Carl Jung]].{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1pp=46–47|2a1=Hammer|2y=2001|2pp=69–70}} 
Drury also identified as an important influence upon the New Age the Indian [[Swami Vivekananda]], an adherent of the philosophy of [[Vedanta]] who first brought Hinduism to the West in the late 19th century.{{sfn|Drury|2004|pp=27–28}}

Hanegraaff believed that the New Age's direct antecedents could be found in the [[UFO religion]]s of the 1950s, which he termed a "proto-New Age movement".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=95–96}} Many of these new religious movements had strong apocalyptic beliefs regarding a coming new age, which they typically asserted would be brought about by contact with extraterrestrials.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1pp=95–96|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=72}} Examples of such groups included the [[Aetherius Society]], founded in the UK in 1955, and the [[Heralds of the New Age]], established in New Zealand in 1956.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=72, 74}}

=== 1960s ===
From a historical perspective, the New Age phenomenon is rooted in the [[counterculture of the 1960s]].{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=11|2a1=Pike|2y=2004|2p=15}} Although not common throughout the counterculture, usage of the terms "New Age" and "Age of Aquarius" – used in reference to a coming era – were found within it,{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=108–109}} for instance appearing on adverts for the [[Woodstock]] festival of 1969,{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=109}} and in the lyrics of "[[Aquarius (song)|Aquarius]]", the opening song of the 1967 musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=10|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=109|3a1=Sutcliffe|3a2=Gilhus|3y=2013|3p=4}}
This decade also witnessed the emergence of a variety of new religious movements and newly established religions in the United States, creating a spiritual milieu from which the New Age drew upon; these included the [[San Francisco Zen Center]], [[Transcendental Meditation]], [[Soka Gakkai]], the [[Inner Peace Movement]], the [[Church of All Worlds]], and the [[Church of Satan]].{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=53–54}} Although there had been an established interest in Asian religious ideas in the U.S. from at least the eighteenth-century,{{sfn|Brown|1992|pp=88–89}} many of these new developments were variants of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Sufism]], which had been imported to the West from Asia following the U.S. government's decision to rescind the [[Asian Exclusion Act]] in 1965.{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=20|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2pp=54–55}} In 1962 the [[Esalen Institute]] was established in [[Big Sur]], [[California]].{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1pp=36–37|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=35|3a1=Hanegraaff|3y=1996|3pp=38–39|4a1=Heelas|4y=1996|4p=51}} Esalen and similar personal growth centers had developed links to [[humanistic psychology]], and from this, the [[human potential movement]] emerged, strongly influenced the New Age.{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1pp=36, 41–43|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=8|3a1=Heelas|3y=1996|3p=53}}

In Britain, a number of small religious groups that came to be identified as the "light" movement had begun declaring the existence of a coming new age, influenced strongly by the Theosophical ideas of Blavatsky and Bailey.{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=20}} The most prominent of these groups was the [[Findhorn Foundation]], which founded the Findhorn Ecovillage in the Scottish area of [[Findhorn]], [[Moray]] in 1962.{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=20|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=35|3a1=Hanegraaff|3y=1996|3pp=38–39|4a1=Heelas|4y=1996|4p=51|5a1=Chryssides|5y=2007|5p=8}} Although its founders were from an older generation, Findhorn attracted increasing numbers of countercultural baby boomers during the 1960s, to the extent that its population had grown sixfold to circa 120 residents by 1972.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=118}} In October 1965, the founder of Findhorn, [[Peter Caddy]], attended a meeting of various prominent figures within Britain's esoteric milieu; titled "The Significance of the Group in the New Age", it was held at [[Attingham Park]] over the course of a weekend.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=83–84}}

All of these groups created the backdrop from which the New Age movement emerged. As James R. Lewis and [[J. Gordon Melton]] point out, the New Age phenomenon represents "a synthesis of many different preexisting movements and strands of thought".{{sfn|Lewis|Melton|1992|p=xi}} Nevertheless, York asserted that while the New Age bore many similarities with both earlier forms of Western esotericism and Asian religion, it remained "distinct from its predecessors in its own self-consciousness as a new way of thinking".{{sfn|York|1995|p=1}}

===Emergence and development: c. 1970–2000===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="The late 1950s saw the first stirrings within the cultic milieu of a belief in a coming new age. A variety of small movements arose, revolving around revealed messages from beings in space and presenting a synthesis of post-Theosophical and other esoteric doctrines. These movements might have remained marginal, had it not been for the explosion of the counterculture in the 1960s and early 1970s. Various historical threads... began to converge: nineteenth century doctrinal elements such as Theosophy and post-Theosophical esotericism as well as harmonious or positive thinking were now eclectically combined with... religious psychologies: transpersonal psychology, Jungianism and a variety of Eastern teachings. It became perfectly feasible for the same individuals to consult the I Ching, practice Jungian astrology, read Abraham Maslow's writings on peak experiences, etc. The reason for the ready incorporation of such disparate sources was a similar goal of exploring an individualized and largely non-Christian religiosity."|source=— Scholar of esotericism Olav Hammer, 2001.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=73}} }}

By the early 1970s, use of the term "New Age" was increasingly common within the cultic milieu.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=73}} This was because—according to Sutcliffe—the "emblem" of the "New Age" had been passed from the "subcultural pioneers" in groups like Findhorn to the wider array of "countercultural baby boomers" between ''circa'' 1967 and 1974. He noted that as this happened, the meaning of the term "New Age" changed; whereas it had once referred specifically to a coming era, at this point it came to be used in a wider sense to refer to a variety of spiritual activities and practices.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=112}} In the latter part of the 1970s, the New Age expanded to cover a wide variety of alternative spiritual and religious beliefs and practices, not all of which explicitly held to the belief in the Age of Aquarius, but were nevertheless widely recognised as broadly similar in their search for "alternatives" to mainstream society.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=97}} In doing so, the "New Age" became a banner under which to bring together the wider "cultic milieu" of American society.{{sfn|York|1995|p=33}}

The counterculture of the 1960s had rapidly declined by the start of the 1970s, in large part due to the collapse of the [[commune]] movement,{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=54}} but it would be many former members of the counter-culture and [[hippie]] subculture who subsequently became early adherents of the New Age movement.{{sfn|Lewis|Melton|1992|p=xi}}
The exact origins of the New Age movement remain an issue of debate; Melton asserted that it emerged in the early 1970s,{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=18}} whereas Hanegraaff instead traced its emergence to the latter 1970s, adding that it then entered its full development in the 1980s.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=12}} This early form of the movement was based largely in Britain and exhibited a strong influence from Theosophy and [[Anthroposophy]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=97}} Hanegraaff termed this early core of the movement the ''New Age sensu stricto'', or "New Age in the strict sense".{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=97|2a1=Sutcliffe|2a2=Gilhus|2y=2013|2p=4}}

Hanegraaff terms the broader development the ''New Age sensu lato'', or "New Age in the wider sense".{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=97|2a1=Sutcliffe|2a2=Gilhus|2y=2013|2p=4}} Stores that came to be known as "New Age shops" opened up, selling related books, magazines, jewellery, and crystals, and they were typified by the playing of New Age music and the smell of incense.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=126–127}}This probably influenced several thousand small metaphysical book- and gift-stores that increasingly defined themselves as "New Age bookstores",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Fifty Years Among the New Words: A Dictionary of Neologisms, 1941–1991|first1=John|last1=Algeo|first2=Adele S. |last2=Algeo|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=234|isbn=978-0-521-44971-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while New Age titles came to be increasingly available from mainstream bookstores and then websites like [[Amazon.com]].{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=16}}

Not everyone who came to be associated with the New Age phenomenon openly embraced the term "New Age", although it was popularised in books like [[David Spangler]]'s 1977 work ''Revelation: The Birth of a New Age'' and [[Mark Satin]]'s 1979 book ''New Age Politics: Healing Self and Society''.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=124}} [[Marilyn Ferguson]]'s 1982 book ''[[The Aquarian Conspiracy]]'' has also been regarded as a landmark work in the development of the New Age, promoting the idea that a new era was emerging.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=9}} Other terms that were employed synonymously with "New Age" in this milieu included "Green", "Holistic", "Alternative", and "Spiritual".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=128}}

1971 witnessed the foundation of [[Erhard Seminars Training|est]] by [[Werner H. Erhard]], a transformational training course that became a prominent part of the early movement.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=58–60}} Melton suggested that the 1970s witnessed the growth of a relationship between the New Age movement and the older New Thought movement, as evidenced by the widespread use of [[Helen Schucman]]'s ''[[A Course in Miracles]]'' (1975), New Age music, and crystal healing in New Thought churches.{{sfn|Melton|1992|pp=25–26}} Some figures in the New Thought movement were sceptical, challenging the compatibility of New Age and New Thought perspectives.{{sfn|Melton|1992|pp=26–27}} During these decades, Findhorn had become a site of [[pilgrimage]] for many New Agers, and greatly expanded in size as people joined the community, with workshops and conferences being held there that brought together New Age thinkers from across the world.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=29}}

[[File:New Age Shrine Glastonbury - geograph.org.uk - 167848.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A new age shrine. |New Age shrine in [[Glastonbury]], England]]

Several key events occurred, which raised public awareness of the New Age subculture: publication of [[Linda Goodman]]'s best-selling astrology books ''Sun Signs'' (1968) and ''Love Signs'' (1978); the release of [[Shirley MacLaine]]'s book ''[[Out on a Limb (Shirley MacLaine book)|Out on a Limb]]'' (1983), later adapted into a television mini-series with the same name (1987); and the "[[Harmonic Convergence]]" [[planetary alignment]] on August 16 and 17, 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Hanegraaff|1996 | p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized by [[José Argüelles]] in [[Sedona, Arizona]]. The Convergence attracted more people to the movement than any other single event.{{sfn|Lewis|Melton|1992|p=ix}} Heelas suggested that the movement was influenced by the "enterprise culture" encouraged by the U.S. and U.K. governments during the 1980s onward, with its emphasis on initiative and self-reliance resonating with any New Age ideas.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=168}}

The claims of channelers [[Jane Roberts]] ([[Seth Material]]), Helen Schucman (''[[A Course in Miracles]]''), [[J. Z. Knight]] ([[Ramtha]]), [[Neale Donald Walsch]] (''[[Conversations with God]]'') (note that Walsch denies being a "channeler" and his books make it obvious that he is not one, though the text emerged through a dialogue with a deeper part of himself in a process comparable to [[automatic writing]]) contributed to the movement's growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Lewis|1992 | pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Drury|2004 | pp=133–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant exponent of the New Age movement in the U.S. has been cited as [[Ram Dass]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kyle|1y=1995|1pp=66–67|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=35}} Core works in the propagating New Age ideas included Jane Roberts's Seth series, published from 1972 onward,{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=16}} Helen Schucman's 1975 publication ''A Course in Miracles'',{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=1995|1pp=35–36|2a1=Pike|2y=2004|2p=16}} and [[James Redfield]]'s 1993 work ''[[The Celestine Prophecy]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Sutcliffe|1y=2003a|1p=127|2a1=Pike|2y=2004|2p=16}} A variety of these books were [[best seller]]s, with the Seth book series for instance selling over a million copies.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=16}} Supplementing these books were videos, audiotapes, compact discs and websites.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=17}} The development of the internet in particular further popularized New Age ideas and made them more widely accessible.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=18}}

New Age ideas influenced the development of [[rave]] culture in the late 1980s and 1990s.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=168}} In Britain during the 1980s, the term "[[New Age Travellers]]" came into use,{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=129}} although York characterised this term as "a misnomer created by the media".{{sfn|York|2001|p=370}} These New Age Travellers had little to do with the New Age as the term was used more widely,{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=8}} with scholar of religion Daren Kemp observing that "New Age spirituality is not an essential part of New Age Traveller culture, although there are similarities between the two worldviews".{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=34}} The term "New Age" came to be used increasingly widely by the popular media in the 1990s.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=129}}

===Decline or transformation?: 1990–present===

By the late 1980s, some publishers dropped the term "New Age" as a marketing device.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=35}} In 1994, the scholar of religion [[Gordon J. Melton]] presented a conference paper in which he argued that, given that he knew of nobody describing their practices as "New Age" anymore, the New Age had died.{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=178}} In 2001, Hammer observed that the term "New Age" had increasingly been rejected as either pejorative or meaningless by individuals within the Western cultic milieu.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=74}} He also noted that within this milieu it was not being replaced by any alternative, and that as such a sense of collective identity was being lost.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=74}}

Other scholars disagreed with Melton's idea; in 2004 Daren Kemp stated that "New Age is still very much alive".{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=179}} Hammer himself stated that "the New Age ''movement'' may be on the wane, but the wider New Age ''religiosity''... shows no sign of disappearing".{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=75}} MacKian suggested that the New Age "movement" had been replaced by a wider "New Age sentiment" which had come to pervade "the socio-cultural landscape" of Western countries.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=7}} Its diffusion into the mainstream may have been influenced by the adoption of New Age concepts by high profile figures: U.S. First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]] consulted an astrologer, British [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] visited spirit mediums, and Norwegian Princess [[Princess Märtha Louise of Norway|Märtha Louise]] established a school devoted to communicating with angels.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=146}} 
New Age shops continued to operate, although many have been remarketed as "Mind, Body, Spirit".{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=17}} 

In 2015, the scholar of religion [[Hugh Urban]] argued that New Age spirituality is growing in the United States and can be expected to become more visible: "According to many recent surveys of religious affiliation, the 'spiritual but not religious' category is one of the fastest-growing trends in American culture, so the New Age attitude of spiritual individualism and eclecticism may well be an increasingly visible one in the decades to come".{{sfn|Urban|2015|p=11}}

==Beliefs and practices==
{{Main article|Spiritual but not religious|List of New Age topics}}

===Eclecticism and self-spirituality===

The New Age places strong emphasis on the idea that the individual and their own experiences are the primary source of authority on spiritual matters.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1pp=201–202|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2pp=21–23|3a1=Pike|3y=2004|3p=26}} It exhibits what Heelas termed "unmediated individualism",{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=21–23}} and reflects a world-view that is "radically democratic".{{sfn|Riordan|1992|p=124}} It places an emphasis on the freedom and autonomy of the individual.{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1pp=26–27|2a1=MacKian|2y=2012|2p=119}} This emphasis has led to ethical disagreements; some New Agers believe helping others is beneficial, although another view is that doing so encourages dependency and conflicts with a reliance on the self.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=25}} Nevertheless, within the New Age, there are differences in the role accorded to voices of authority outside of the self.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=34}} Hammer stated that "a belief in the existence of a core or true Self" is a "recurring theme" in New Age texts.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=11}} The concept of "[[personal growth]]" is also greatly emphasised among New Agers,{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=46|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=188}} while Heelas noted that "for participants spirituality ''is'' life-itself".{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=27}}

New Age religiosity is typified by its eclecticism.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=163}} Generally believing that there is no one true way to pursue spirituality,{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=118–119}} New Agers develop their own worldview "by combining bits and pieces to form their own individual mix",{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=28}} seeking what Drury called "a spirituality without borders or confining dogmas".{{sfn|Drury|2004|p=8}} The anthropologist David J. Hess noted that in his experience, a common attitude among New Agers was that "any alternative spiritual path is good because it is spiritual and alternative".{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=36}} This approach that has generated a common jibe that New Age represents "supermarket spirituality".{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=32}} York suggested that this eclecticism stemmed from the New Age's origins within [[late modernity|late modern]] capitalism, with New Agers subscribing to a belief in a free market of spiritual ideas as a parallel to a free market in economics.{{sfn|York|2001|p=367}} 

As part of its eclecticism, the New Age draws ideas from many different cultural and spiritual traditions from across the world, often legitimising this approach by reference to "a very vague claim" about underlying global unity.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=139}} Certain societies are more usually chosen over others;{{sfnm|1a1=Hammer|1y=2001|1p=199|2a1=Kemp|2y=2004|2p=49}} examples include the ancient Celts, ancient Egyptians, the [[Essenes]], [[Atlantis|Atlanteans]], and ancient extra-terrestrials.{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=47}} As noted by Hammer: "to put it bluntly, no significant spokespersons within the New Age community claim to represent ancient Albanian wisdom, simply because beliefs regarding ancient Albanians are not part of our cultural stereotypes".{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=199}} According to Hess, these ancient or foreign societies represent an exotic "Other" for New Agers, who are predominantly white Westerners.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=48}}

===Theology, cosmogony, and cosmology===

[[File:Snoqualmie Moondance meditation 02.jpg|thumb|right|New Age meditation group at the Snoqualmie Moondance festival, 1992]]

A belief in [[divinity]] is integral to New Age ideas, although understandings of this divinity vary.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=182–183}} New Age [[theology]] exhibits an inclusive and universalistic approach that accepts all personal perspectives on the divine as equally valid.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=185}} This intentional vagueness as to the nature of divinity also reflects the New Age idea that divinity cannot be comprehended by the human mind or language.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=186}} New Age literature nevertheless displays recurring traits in its depiction of the divine: the first is the idea that it is [[Holism|holistic]], thus frequently being described with such terms as an "Ocean of Oneness", "Infinite Spirit", "Primal Stream", "One Essence", and "Universal Principle".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=186}} A second trait is the characterisation of divinity as "Mind", "Consciousness", and "Intelligence",{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=186–187}} while a third is the description of divinity as a form of "[[Energy (esotericism)|energy]]".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=187}} A fourth trait is the characterisation of divinity as a "life force", the essence of which is creativity, while a fifth is the concept that divinity consists of [[love]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=187–188}}

Most New Age groups believe in an Ultimate Source from which all things originate, which is usually conflated with the divine.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=120}} Various [[creation myths]] have been articulated in New Age publications outlining how this Ultimate Source created the universe and everything in it.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=122–123}} In contrast, some New Agers emphasise the idea of a universal inter-relatedness that is not always emanating from a single source.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=128}} The New Age worldview emphasises holism and the idea that everything in existence is intricately connected as part of a single whole,{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=119|2a1=Drury|2y=2004|2p=11}} in doing so rejecting both the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] of Judeo-Christian thought and the [[reductionism]] of Cartesian science.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=119}} A number of New Agers have linked this holistic interpretation of the universe to the [[Gaia hypothesis]] of [[James Lovelock]].{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=23}} The idea of holistic divinity results in a common New Age belief that humans themselves are divine in essence, a concept described using such terms as "droplet of divinity", "inner Godhead", and "divine self".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=204}} Influenced by Theosophical and Anthroposophical ideas regarding '[[subtle bodies]]',{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=222–223}} a common New Age idea holds to the existence of a "Higher Self" that is a part of the human but connects with the divine essence of the universe, and which can advise the human mind through [[intuition]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=211–212}}

Cosmogonical creation stories are common in New Age sources,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=304}} with these accounts reflecting the movement's holistic framework by describing an original, primal oneness from which all things in the universe emanated.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=305}} An additional common theme is that human souls – once living in a spiritual world – then descended into a world of matter.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=307–308}}
The New Age movement typically views the material universe as a meaningful illusion, which humans should try to use constructively rather than focus on escaping into other spiritual realms.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=115}} This physical world is hence seen as "a domain for learning and growth" after which the human soul might pass on to higher levels of existence.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=116–117}} There is thus a widespread belief that reality is engaged in an ongoing process of evolution; rather than [[Darwinian evolution]], this is typically seen as either a teleological evolution which assumes a process headed to a specific goal, or an open-ended, creative evolution.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=158–160}}

MacKian argued that a central, but often overlooked, element of the phenomenon was an emphasis on "[[spirit]]", and in particular participants' desire for a relationship with spirit.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=51, 117}} Many practitioners in her UK-focused study described themselves as "workers ''for'' spirit", expressing the desire to help people learn about spirit.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=145}} They understood various material signs as marking the presence of spirit, for instance the unexpected appearance of a feather.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=142–143}} New Agers often call upon this spirit to assist them in everyday situations, for instance to ease the traffic flow on their way to work.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=84, 143}}  

New Age literature often refers to benevolent non-human spirit-beings who are interested in humanity's spiritual development; these are variously referred to as angels, [[guardian angel]]s, personal guides, masters, teachers, and contacts.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=197, 198}} New Age angelology is nevertheless unsystematic, reflecting the idiosyncrasies of individual authors.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=198}} The figure of Jesus Christ is often mentioned within New Age literature as a mediating principle between divinity and humanity, as well as an exemplar of a spiritually advanced human being.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=189–190}}

Although not present in every New Age group,{{sfn|Riordan|1992|p=105}} a core belief within the milieu is in [[mediumship|channeling]].{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=21|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=23|3a1=Pike|3y=2004|3p=24}} This is the idea that humans beings, sometimes (although not always) in a state of [[trance]], can act "as a channel of information from sources other than their normal selves".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=23–24}} These sources are varyingly described as being [[God]], [[gods]] and [[goddesses]], [[ascended masters]], [[spirit guide]]s, [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]], [[angel]]s, [[Deva (New Age)|devas]], historical figures, the [[collective unconscious]], [[elemental]]s, or [[nature spirit]]s.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=23–24}} Hanegraaff described channeling as a form of "articulated revelation",{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=24}} and identified four forms: trance channeling, automatisms, clairaudient channeling, and open channeling.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=27–28}}

Prominent examples of New Age channeling include Jane Roberts' claims that she was contacted by an entity called Seth, and Helen Schucman's claims to have channeled Jesus Christ.{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=22|2a1=Riordan|2y=1992|2pp=108–110|3a1=Pike|3y=2004|3p=28}} The academic Suzanne Riordan examined a variety of these New Age channeled messages, noting that they typically "echoed each other in tone and content", offering an analysis of the human condition and giving instructions or advice for how humanity can discover its true destiny.{{sfn|Riordan|1992|p=110}}
For many New Agers, these channeled messages rival the scriptures of the main world religions as sources of spiritual authority,{{sfn|Riordan|1992|p=108}} although often New Agers describe historical religious revelations as forms of "channeling" as well, thus attempting to legitimate and authenticate their own contemporary practices.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=26–27}} Although the concept of channeling from discarnate spirit entities has links to [[Spiritualism]] and [[psychical research]], the New Age does not feature Spiritualism's emphasis on proving the existence of life after death, nor psychical research's focus of testing mediums for consistency.{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=23}}

===Astrological cycles and the Age of Aquarius===

New Age thought typically envisions the world as developing through cosmological cycles that can be identified [[astrology|astrologically]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=102, 302}} It adopts this concept from Theosophy, although often presents it in a looser and more eclectic way than is found in Theosophical teaching.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=303}} New Age literature often claims that humanity once lived in an age of spiritual wisdom.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=302}} In the writings of New Agers like Edgar Cayce, the ancient period of spiritual wisdom is associated with concepts of supremely-advanced societies living on [[Lost lands|lost continents]] such as Atlantis, [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]], and [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]], as well as the idea that ancient societies like those of [[Ancient Egypt]] were far more technologically advanced than modern scholarship accepts.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=309–314}}
New Age literature often posits that the ancient period of spiritual wisdom gave way to an age of spiritual decline, sometimes termed the [[Age of Pisces]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=302}} Although characterised as being a negative period for humanity, New Age literature views the Age of Pisces as an important learning experience for the species.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=320}} 
Hanegraaff stated that New Age perceptions of history were "extremely sketchy" in their use of description,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=320}} reflecting little interest in [[historiography]] and conflating history with [[myth]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=324}} He also noted that they were highly [[ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] in placing [[Western world|Western civilization]] at the centre of historical development.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=303}}

[[File:Venice ast sm.jpg|thumb|left|Astrological ideas hold a central place in the New Age]]

A common belief among the New Age is that humanity has entered, or is coming to enter, a new period known as the [[Age of Aquarius]],{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=94}} which Melton has characterised as a "New Age of love, joy, peace, abundance, and harmony[...] the Golden Age heretofore only dreamed about."{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=19}} In accepting this belief in a coming new age, the milieu has been described as "highly positive, celebratory, [and] utopian",{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=28}} and has also been cited as an [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic movement]].{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=24}} Opinions about the nature of the coming Age of Aquarius differ among New Agers.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=333}} There are for instance differences in belief about its commencement; New Age author David Spangler claimed that it began in 1967,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=334–335}} others placed its beginning with the Harmonic Convergence of 1987,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=335}} author José Argüelles predicted its start [[2012 phenomenon|in 2012]],{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=72}} and some believe that it will not begin until several centuries into the third millennium.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=335–336}}

There are also differences in how this new age is envisioned.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=336}} Those adhering to what Hanegraaff termed the "moderate" perspective believed that it would be marked by an improvement to current society, which affected both New Age concerns—through the convergence of science and mysticism and the global embrace of alternative medicine—to more general concerns, including an end to violence, crime and war, a healthier environment, and international co-operation.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=339–340}} Other New Agers adopt a fully utopian vision, believing that the world will be wholly transformed into an "Age of Light", with humans evolving into totally spiritual beings and experiencing unlimited love, bliss, and happiness.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=341—343}} Rather than conceiving of the Age of Aquarius as an indefinite period, many believe that it would last for around two thousand years before being replaced by a further age.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=102}} 

There are various beliefs within the milieu as to how this new age will come about, but most emphasise the idea that it will be established through [[human agency]]; others assert that it will be established with the aid of non-human forces such as spirits or extra-terrestrials.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=74}} Ferguson for instance claimed that there was a vanguard of humans known as the "Aquarian conspiracy" who were helping to bring the Age of Aquarius forth through their actions.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=70}} Participants in the New Age typically express the view that their own spiritual actions are helping to bring about the Age of Aquarius,{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=19|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2pp=75–76}} with writers like Ferguson and Argüelles presenting themselves as prophets ushering forth this future era.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=73}}

===Healing and alternative medicine===

Another recurring element of New Age is an emphasis on healing and [[alternative medicine]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ellwood|1y=1992|1p=60|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=37|3a1=Hanegraaff|3y=1996|3p=42|4a1=Sutcliffe|4y=2003a|4p=174}}&lt;ref name="Butler 2007"&gt;Butler, Jenny and Maria Tighe, "Holistic Health and New Age in the British Isles". 415-34 in Kemp, Daren and Lewis, James R., ed. (2007), Handbook of New Age, Boston, Massachusetts, US: Brill Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|978-90-04-15355-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The general New Age ethos is that health is the natural state for the human being and that illness is a disruption of that natural balance.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=46–47}} Hence, New Age therapies seek to heal "[[illness]]" as a general concept that includes physical, mental, and spiritual aspects; in doing so it critiques mainstream Western medicine for simply attempting to cure [[disease]], and thus has an affinity with most forms of [[traditional medicine]].{{sfnm|1a1=Albanese|1y=1992|1pp=81–82|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=42–43|3a1=Sutcliffe|3y=2003a|3p=176}} Its focus of self-spirituality has led to the emphasis of self-healing,{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1pp=82–87|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2pp=176, 178|3a1=MacKian|3y=2012|3p=160}} although also present are ideas on healing both others and the Earth itself.{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1pp=82–87|2a1=MacKian|2y=2012|2p=160}}

[[File:Siete chakras.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Reiki]] is one of the alternative therapies commonly found in the New Age movement.]]

The healing elements of the movement are difficult to classify given that a variety of terms are used, with some New Age authors using different terms to refer to the same trends, while others use the same term to refer to different things.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=48}} However, Hanegraaff developed a set of categories into which the forms of New Age healing could be roughly categorised. The first of these was the [[Human Potential Movement]], which argues that contemporary Western society suppresses much human potential, and accordingly professes to offer a path through which individuals can access those parts of themselves that they have alienated and suppressed, thus enabling them to reach their full potential and live a meaningful life.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=48–49}} Hanegraaff described [[transpersonal psychology]] as the "theoretical wing" of this Human Potential Movement; in contrast to other schools of psychological thought, transpersonal psychology takes religious and mystical experiences seriously by exploring the uses of [[altered states of consciousness]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=50–51}} Closely connected to this is the [[Neoshamanism|shamanic consciousness]] current, which argues that the [[shamanism|shaman]] was a specialist in altered states of consciousness and seeks to adopt and imitate traditional shamanic techniques as a form of personal healing and growth.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=52}}

Hanegraaff identified the second main healing current in the New Age movement as being [[holistic health]]. This emerged in the 1970s out of the [[free clinic]] movement of the 1960s, and has various connections with the Human Potential Movement.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=53–54}} It emphasises the idea that the human individual is a holistic, interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit, and that healing is a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=54}} A very wide array of methods are utilised within the holistic health movement, with some of the most common including [[acupuncture]], reiki, [[biofeedback]], [[chiropractic]], [[yoga]], [[kinesiology]], [[homeopathy]], [[aromatherapy]] [[iridology]], [[massage]] and other forms of [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]], [[meditation]] and [[Visual perception|visualisation]], nutritional therapy, [[psychic healing]], [[herbal medicine]], [[crystal healing|healing using crystals]], metals, music, [[chromotherapy]], and reincarnation therapy.{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=1995|1p=37|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=54–55|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=30}} The use of crystal healing has become a particularly prominent visual trope within the New Age;{{sfn|Albanese|1992|p=79}} this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in the New Age milieu.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=162}}
The mainstreaming of the Holistic Health movement in the UK is discussed by Maria Tighe. The inter-relation of holistic health with the New Age movement is illustrated in Jenny Butler's ethnographic description of "Angel therapy" in Ireland.&lt;ref name="Butler 2007"/&gt;

==="New Age science"===
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="The New Age is essentially about the search for spiritual and philosophical perspectives that will help transform humanity and the world. New Agers are willing to absorb wisdom teachings wherever they can find them, whether from an Indian guru, a renegade Christian priest, an itinerant Buddhist monk, an experiential psychotherapist or a Native American shaman. They are eager to explore their own inner potential with a view to becoming part of a broader process of social transformation. Their journey is towards totality of being."|source=— New Ager [[Nevill Drury]], 2004.{{sfn|Drury|2004|p=11}} }}

According to Drury, the New Age attempts to create "a worldview that includes both science and spirituality",{{sfn|Drury|2004|p=10}} while Hess noted how New Agers have "a penchant for bringing together the technical and the spiritual, the scientific and the religious".{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=4}}
Although New Agers typically reject [[rationalism]], the [[scientific method]], and the academic establishment, they employ terminology and concepts borrowed from science and particularly from the [[Physics beyond the Standard Model|New Physics]].{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1p=5|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=62}} Moreover, a number of prominent influences on New Age, such as [[David Bohm]] and [[Ilya Prigogine]], had backgrounds as professional scientists.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=63}} Hanegraaff identified "New Age science" as a form of ''[[Naturphilosophie]]''.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=64}} 

In this, the milieu is interested in developing unified world views to discover the nature of the divine and establish a scientific basis for religious belief.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=63}} Figures in the New Age movement—most notably [[Fritjof Capra]] in his ''[[The Tao of Physics]]'' (1975)—have drawn parallels between theories in the New Physics and traditional forms of [[mysticism]], thus arguing that ancient religious ideas are now being proven by contemporary science.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=128–129}} Many New Agers have adopted James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis that the Earth acts akin to a single living organism, although have expanded this idea to include the idea that the Earth has consciousness and intelligence.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1pp=155–156|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2p=86}}

Despite New Agers' appeals to science, most of the academic and scientific establishments dismiss "New Age science" as [[pseudo-science]], or at best existing in part on the fringes of genuine scientific research.{{sfnm|1a1=Hess|1y=1993|1p=11|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=62}} This is an attitude also shared by many active in the field of [[parapsychology]].{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=11}} In turn, New Agers often accuse the scientific establishment of pursuing a dogmatic and outmoded approach to scientific enquiry,{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=68}} believing that their own understandings of the universe will replace those of the academic establishment in a [[paradigm shift]].{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1p=5|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=62}}

===Ethics and afterlife===

There is no ethical cohesion within the New Age phenomenon,{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=35}} although Hanegraaff argued that the central ethical tenet of the New Age is to cultivate one's own divine potential.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=281}} Given that the movement's holistic interpretation of the universe prohibits a belief in a dualistic [[good and evil]],{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=277}} negative events that happen are interpreted not as the result of evil but as lessons designed to teach an individual and enable them to advance spiritually.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=236–237, 278}}
It rejects the Christian emphasis on [[sin]] and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], believing that these generate fear and thus negativity, which then hinder spiritual evolution.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=294–295}} It also typically criticises the blaming and judging of others for their actions, believing that if an individual adopts these negative attitudes it harms their own spiritual evolution.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=293}} Instead the movement emphasizes positive thinking, although beliefs regarding the power behind such thoughts vary within New Age literature.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=240}} Common New Age examples of how to generate such positive thinking include the repeated recitation of mantras and statements carrying positive messages,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=240—241}} and the visualisation of a white light.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=242}}

According to Hanegraaff, the question of death and afterlife is not a "pressing problem requiring an answer" in the New Age.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=258}} A belief in [[reincarnation]] is very common, where it often viewed as being part of an individual's progressive spiritual evolution toward realisation of their own divinity.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=262|2a1=York|2y=2001|2p=364|3a1=MacKian|3y=2012|3p=109}} In New Age literature, the reality of reincarnation is usually treated as self-evident, with no explanation as to why practitioners embrace this afterlife belief over others,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=263}} although New Agers endorse it in the belief that it ensures cosmic justice.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=264}} Many New Agers believe in [[karma]], treating it as a law of cause and effect that assures cosmic balance, although in some cases they stress that it is not a system that enforces punishment for past actions.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=286}}
In much New Age literature on reincarnation, it is claimed that part of the human soul, that which carries the personality, perishes with the death of the body, while the Higher Self – that which connects with divinity – survives in order to be reborn into another body.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=266}} It is believed that the Higher Self chooses the body and circumstances into which it will be born, in order to use it as a vessel through which to learn new lessons and thus advance its own spiritual evolution.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=262}} Prominent New Age writers like [[Shakti Gawain]] and [[Louise Hay]] therefore express the view that humans are responsible for the events that happen to them during their life, an idea that many New Agers regard as empowering.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=234}} At times, past life regression are employed within the New Age in order to reveal a Higher Soul's previous incarnations, usually with an explicit healing purpose.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=271–275}} Some practitioners espouse the idea of a "soul group" or "soul family", a group of connected souls who reincarnate together as family of friendship units.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=109}} Rather than reincarnation, another afterlife belief found among New Agers holds that an individual's soul returns to a "universal energy" on bodily death.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=109}}

==Demographics==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=By the early twenty-first century... [the New Age phenomenon] has an almost entirely white, middle-class demography largely made up of professional, managerial, arts, and entrepreneurial occupations.|source=— Religious studies scholar Steven J. Sutcliffe.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=223}} }}

In the mid-1990s, the New Age was found primarily in the United States and Canada, Western Europe, and Australia and New Zealand.{{sfn|York|1995|p=42}} The fact that most individuals engaging in New Age activity do not describe themselves as "New Agers" renders it difficult to determine how many practitioners there are.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=2}} Heelas highlighted the range of attempts to establish the number of New Age participants in the U.S. during this period, noting that estimates ranged from 20,000 to 6 million; he believed that the higher ranges of these estimates were greatly inflated by, for instance, an erroneous assumption that all Americans who believed in reincarnation were part of the movement.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=112}} He nevertheless suggested that over 10 million people in the U.S. had had some contact with New Age practices or ideas.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=120}} In 2006, Heelas stated that New Age practices had grown to such an extent that they were "increasingly rivalling the sway of Christianity in western settings".{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=4}}

Sociological investigation indicates that certain sectors of society are more likely to engage in New Age practices than others.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=223–224}} The majority of participants are from the middle and upper-middle classes of Western society.{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1p=121|2a1=Partridge|2y=2004|2p=53}} Sutcliffe noted that although most influential New Age figureheads were male,{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=220–221}} approximately two-thirds of its participants were female.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=220}}
The movement is strongly gendered; sociologist Ciara O'Connor argues that it shows a tension between commodification and women's empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Ciara, "Becoming whole: an exploration of women's choices in the holistic and New Age movement in Ireland". 220–39 in Olivia Cosgrove et al. (eds), Ireland's new religious movements. Cambridge Scholars, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Sutcliffe described the "typical" participant in the New Age milieu as being "a religious individualist, mixing and matching cultural resources in an animated spiritual quest".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=200}}

[[File:Rave in the Henge 2005.jpg|thumb|left|200px|alt=Stonehenge at night, with revellers inside|[[Stonehenge]] is a site visited by New Age pilgrims, as seen in this midsummer rave]]

In the United States, the first people to embrace the New Age belonged to the [[baby boomer]] generation, those born between 1946 and 1964.{{sfn|Brown|1992|p=90}} 
Heelas added that within that broad demographic, the movement had nevertheless attracted a diverse clientele.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=136}} He typified the typical New Ager as someone who was well-educated yet disenchanted with mainstream society, thus arguing that the movement catered to those who believe that [[modernity]] is in crisis.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=137–138}} He suggested that the movement appealed to many former practitioners of the 1960s counter-culture because while they came to feel that they were unable to change society, they were nonetheless interested in changing the self.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=142}} He believed that many individuals had been "culturally primed for what the New Age has to offer",{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=172}} with the New Age attracting "expressive" people who were already comfortable with the ideals and outlooks of the movement's self-spirituality focus.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=161–162}} It could be particularly appealing because the New Age suited the needs of the individual, whereas traditional religious options that are available primarily catered for the needs of a community.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=173}} He believed that although the adoption of New Age beliefs and practices by some fitted the model of [[religious conversion]],{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=186}} others who adopted some of its practices could not easily be considered to have converted to the religion.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=183}}

The degree to which individuals are involved in the New Age varies.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=117}} Heelas argued that those involved could be divided into three broad groups; the first comprised those who were completely dedicated to it and its ideals, often working in professions that furthered those goals. The second consisted of "serious part-timers" who worked in unrelated fields but who nevertheless spent much of their free time involved in movement activities. The third was that of "casual part-timers" who occasionally involved themselves in New Age activities but for whom the movement was not a central aspect of their life.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=118–119}} MacKian instead suggested that involvement could be seen as being layered like an onion; at the core are "consultative" practitioners who devote their life to New Age practices, around that are "serious" practitioners who still invest considerable effort into New Age activities, and on the periphery are "non-practitioner consumers", individuals affected by he general dissemination of New Age ideas but who do not devote themselves more fully to them.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=73–74}} Many New Age practices have filtered into wider Western society, with a 2000 poll for instance revealing that 39% of the UK population had tried alternative therapies.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=52}}

In 1995, Kyle stated that on the whole, New Agers in the United States preferred the values of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] over those of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He added that most New Agers "soundly rejected" the agenda of former Republican President [[Ronald Reagan]].{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=846}}

===Social communities===

MacKian suggested that this phenomenon was "an inherently ''social'' mode of spirituality", one which cultivated a sense of belonging among its participants and encouraged relations both with other humans and with non-human, otherworldly spirit entities.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=136}}
MacKian suggested that these communities "may look very different" from those of traditional religious groups.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=135}}

Online connections were one of the ways that interested individuals met new contacts and established networks.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=131}}

Some New Agers advocate living in a [[simple living|simple]] and [[sustainable living|sustainable]] manner to reduce humanity's impact on the [[natural resource]]s of Earth; and they shun [[consumerism]].{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=74–75}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Spring|first=Joel H.|title=How Educational Ideologies Are Shaping Global Society: Intergovernmental Organizations, NGO's, and the Decline of the Nation-state|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, New Jersey, US|year=2004|edition=illustrated|page=119|chapter=Chapter 4: Love the Biosphere: Environmental Ideologies Shaping Global Society|isbn=978-0-8058-4915-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8Xssc9_3FPgC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=%22Sustainable+living%22+new+agers#PPA119,M1|archiveurl=https://books.google.com/?id=8Xssc9_3FPgC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=%22Sustainable+living%22+new+agers#PPA119,M1|accessdate=2009-03-27|archivedate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Age movement has been centered around rebuilding a [[sense of community]] to counter [[social disintegration]]; this has been attempted through the formation of [[intentional communities]], where individuals come together to live and work in a communal lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Lewis|1992 | pp=200–01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce argued that in seeking to "denying the validity of externally imposed controls and privileging the divine within", the New Age sought to dismantle pre-existing social order, but that it failed to present anything adequate in its place.{{sfn|Bruce|1998|pp=32–33}} Heelas however cautioned that Bruce had arrived at this conclusion based on "flimsy evidence".{{sfn|Heelas|1998|p=258}}

New Age centres have been set up in various parts of the world, representing an institutionalised form of the movement.{{sfn|York|1995|pp=40–41}} Notable examples include the [[Naropa Institute]] in [[Boulder, Colorado]], [[Holly Hock Farm]] near to [[Vancouver]], the [[Wrekin Trust]] in [[West Malvern]], [[Worcestershire]], and the [[Skyros Centre]] in [[Skyros]].{{sfn|York|1995|p=41}}

Criticising mainstream Western education as counterproductive to the ethos of the movement, many New Age groups have established their own schools for the education of children, although in other cases such groups have sought to introduce New Age spiritual techniques into pre-existing establishments.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=77–78}}

===Fairs and festivals===

New Age spirituality has led to a wide array of literature on the subject and an active niche market, with books, music, crafts, and services in alternative medicine available at New Age stores, [[fair]]s, and [[festival]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}
New Age fairs – sometimes known as "Mind, Body, Spirit fairs", "psychic fairs", or "alternative health fairs" – are spaces in which a variety of goods and services are displayed by different vendors, including forms of alternative medicine and esoteric practices such as palmistry or tarot card reading.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=181–183}} A prominent example is the [[Mind Body Spirit Festival]], held annually in the United Kingdom,{{sfnm|1a1=Partridge|1y=2004|1p=65|2a1=MacKian|2y=2012|2p=24}} at which – the religious studies scholar Christopher Partridge noted – one could encounter "a wide range of beliefs and practices from crystal healing to ... Kirlian photography to psychic art, from angels to past-life therapy, from Theosophy to UFO religion, and from New Age music to the vegetarianism of Suma Chign Hai."{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=65}} Similar festivals are held across Europe and in Australia and the United States.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=24}}

===Approaches to financial prosperity and business===

A number of New Age proponents have emphasised the use of spiritual techniques as a tool for attaining financial prosperity, thus moving the movement away from its counter-cultural origins.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=60–62}} Commenting on this "New Age capitalism", Hess observed that it was largely small-scale and entrepreneurial, focused around small companies run by members of the [[petty bourgeoisie]], rather than being dominated by large scale multinational corporations.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=38}} The links between New Age and commercial products have resulted in the accusation that New Age itself is little more than a manifestation of [[consumerism]].{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=6}} This idea is generally rejected by New Age participants, who often reject any link between their practices and consumerist activities.{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=85}}

Embracing this attitude, various books have been published espousing such an ethos, established New Age centres have held spiritual retreats and classes aimed specifically at business people, and New Age groups have developed specialised training for businesses.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=62–65}} During the 1980s, many prominent U.S. corporations—among them [[IBM]], [[AT&amp;T]], and [[General Motors]]—embraced New Age seminars, hoping that they could increase productivity and efficiency among their work force,{{sfn|Rupert|1992|p=127}} although in several cases this resulted in employees bringing legal action against their employers, claiming that such seminars had infringed on their religious beliefs or damaged their psychological health.{{sfn|Rupert|1992|p=133}} However, the use of spiritual techniques as a method for attaining [[Profit (economics)|profit]] has been an issue of major dispute within the wider New Age movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=23|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2p=86}} with prominent New Agers such as Spangler and [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]] criticising what they see as trends within the community that are narcissistic and lack a social conscience.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=358–361}} In particular, the movement's commercial elements have caused problems given that they often conflict with its general economically-egalitarian ethos; as York highlighted, "a tension exists in New Age between socialistic egalitarianism and capitalistic private enterprise".{{sfn|York|1995|p=40}}

Given that it encourages individuals to choose spiritual practices on the grounds of personal preference and thus encourages them to behave as a consumer, the New Age has been considered to be well suited to modern society.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=34}}

===Music===
{{See also|List of new-age music artists|List of ambient artists}}
The term "[[New Age music]]" is applied, sometimes in a derogative manner, to forms of [[ambient music]], a genre that developed in the 1960s and was popularised in the 1970s, particularly with the work of [[Brian Eno]].{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=175}} The genre's relaxing nature resulted in it becoming popular within New Age circles,{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=175}} with some forms of the genre having a specifically New Age orientation.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=178}}
Studies have determined that new-age music can be an effective component of [[stress management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Principles and Practice of Stress Management, Third Edition |editor-last=Lehrer |editor-first=Paul M. |editor2=Robert L. Woolfolk |editor3=Wesley E. Sime |year=2007|pages=46–47|isbn=978-1-59385-000-5|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The style began in the late 1960s and early 1970s with the works of free-form jazz groups recording on the [[ECM (record label)|ECM]] label; such as [[Oregon (band)|Oregon]], the [[Paul Winter Consort]], and other pre-ambient bands; as well as ambient music performer Brian Eno, classical avant-garde musician [[Daniel Kobialka]],&lt;ref name=Birosik&gt;Birosik, Patti Jean (1989).

New-age music evolved to include a wide range of styles from electronic [[space music]] using [[synthesizer]]s and acoustic instrumentals using [[Native American flute]]s and [[drum]]s, [[singing bowl]]s, Australian [[didgeredoo]]s and [[world music]] sounds to spiritual [[chant]]ing from other cultures.&lt;ref name=Birosik /&gt;&lt;ref name=Werkhoven /&gt;

==Politics==

While many commentators have focused on the spiritual and cultural aspects of the New Age movement, it also has a political component. The New Age political movement became visible in the 1970s, peaked in the 1980s, and continued into the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, Richard (1995).  ''The New Age Movement in American Culture''.  University Press of America, Chap.&amp;nbsp;8 ("The New Age Reaches Out: Politics and Economics").  {{ISBN|978-0-7618-0010-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist of religion Steven Bruce noted that the New Age provides ideas on how to deal with "our socio-psychological problems".{{sfn|Bruce|1998|p=23}}  Scholar of religion James R. Lewis observed that, despite the common caricature of New Agers as narcissistic, "significant numbers" of them were "trying to make the planet a better place on which to live," {{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=11}} and scholar J. Gordon Melton's ''New Age Encyclopedia'' (1990) included an entry called "New Age politics". {{sfn|Melton|1990| pp=323–325}}  Some New Agers have entered the political system in an attempt to advocate for the societal transformation that the New Age promotes.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=832}}

===Ideas===

Although New Age activists have been motivated by New Age concepts like holism, interconnectedness, monism, and environmentalism, their political ideas are diverse,{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=832}} ranging from [[far right politics|far-right]] and [[conservatism|conservative]] through to [[liberalism|liberal]], [[socialism|socialist]], and [[libertarianism|libertarian]].{{sfn|York|2001|p=367}} Accordingly, Kyle stated that "New Age politics is difficult to describe and categorize. The standard political labels—left or right, liberal or conservative–miss the mark."{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=832}} MacKian suggested that the New Age operated as a form of "world-realigning infrapolitics" that undermines the [[disenchantment]] of modern Western society.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=154}}

{{double image|left|Mark Satin in 2011.jpg
|141|BENJAMIN CREME 2006.jpg|139|Writers who have espoused political ideas influenced by New Age perspectives included [[Mark Satin]] (left) and [[Benjamin Creme]] (right).}}

The extent to which New Age spokespeople mix religion and politics varies.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=837}} New Agers are often critical of the established political order, regarding it as "fragmented, unjust, hierarchical, patriarchal, and obsolete".{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=832}} The New Ager [[Mark Satin]] for instance spoke of "New Age politics" as a politically radical "third force" that was "neither left nor right". He believed that in contrast to the conventional political focus on the "institutional and economic symptoms" of society's problems, his "New Age politics" would focus on "psychocultural roots" of these issues.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=833}} Ferguson regarded New Age politics as "a kind of Radical Centre", one that was "not neutral, not middle-of-the-road, but a view of the whole road."{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|pp=832–833}} Fritjof Capra argued that Western societies have become sclerotic because of their adherence to an outdated and mechanistic view of reality, which he calls the ''Newtonian/Cartesian paradigm''.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=107}}  In Capra's view, the West needs to develop an organic and ecological "systems view" of reality in order to successfully address its social and political issues.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=107}} [[Corinne McLaughlin]] argued that politics need not connote endless power struggles, that a new "spiritual politics" could attempt to synthesize opposing views on issues into higher levels of understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne, Alan J. (1999).  ''From Politics Past to Politics Future: An Integrated Analysis of Current and Emergent Paradigms''.  Praeger Publishers / Greenwood Publishing Group, p.&amp;nbsp;179.  {{ISBN|978-0-275-96151-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many New Agers advocate [[globalisation]] and [[Glocalization|localisation]], but reject [[nationalism]] and the role of the [[nation-state]].{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=842}} Some New Age spokespeople have called for greater decentralisation and global unity, but are vague about how this might be achieved; others call for a global, centralised government.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|pp=842–843}} Satin for example argued for a move away from the nation-state and towards self-governing regions that, through improved global communication networks, would help engender world unity.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=843}} [[Benjamin Creme]] conversely argued that "the Christ," a great [[Avatar]], Maitreya, the [[World Teacher]], expected by all the major religions as their "Awaited One," would return to the world and establish a strong, centralised global government in the form of the [[United Nations]]; this would be politically re-organised along a spiritual hierarchy.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=845}} Kyle observed that New Agers often speak favourably of [[democracy]] and citizens' involvement in policy making but are critical of [[representative democracy]] and [[majority rule]], thus displaying elitist ideas to their thinking.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=846}}

===Groups===

[[File:New World Alliance 1980.jpg|thumb |220px| right |alt=Twenty people sitting in a circle |The [[New World Alliance]] was one of several New Age political groups in the 1970s and 1980s.]]

Scholars have noted several New Age political groups.  Self-Determination: A Personal/Political Network, lauded by Ferguson&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Marilyn (1980).  ''The Aquarian Conspiracy: Personal and Social Transformation in the 1980s''.  Jeremy P. Tarcher Inc., distributed by Houghton Mifflin, pp.&amp;nbsp;232–235.  {{ISBN|978-0-87477-191-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Satin,&lt;ref&gt;Satin, Mark (1978).  ''New Age Politics: Healing Self and Society''. Delta Books / Dell Publishing Co., pp.&amp;nbsp;219, 345.  {{ISBN|978-0-440-55700-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was described at length by sociology of religion scholar Steven Tipton.&lt;ref&gt;Tipton, Steven M. (1982).  ''Getting Saved from the Sixties: Moral Meaning in Conversion and Cultural Change''.  University of California Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;267–270.  {{ISBN|978-0-520-05228-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Founded in 1975 by California state legislator [[John Vasconcellos]] and others, it encouraged Californians to engage in personal growth work and political activities at the same time, especially at the grassroots level.&lt;ref&gt;Tipton, cited above, pp.&amp;nbsp;267, 270.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hanegraaff noted another California-based group, the [[Institute of Noetic Sciences]], headed by author [[Willis Harman]].  It advocated a change in consciousness – in "basic underlying assumptions" –  in order to come to grips with global crises.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=108–109}}  Kyle said that the New York City-based Planetary Citizens organization, headed by United Nations consultant and ''Earth at Omega'' author Donald Keys, sought to implement New Age political ideas.{{sfn|Kyle|1995|p=67}}

Scholar J. Gordon Melton and colleagues focused on the New World Alliance, a Washington, DC-based organization founded in 1979 by Mark Satin and others.  According to Melton et al., the Alliance tried to combine left- and right-wing ideas as well as personal growth work and political activities.  Group decision-making was facilitated by short periods of silence.{{sfn|Melton|1990|p=324}}  Sponsors of the Alliance's national political newsletter included Willis Harman and John Vasconcellos.&lt;ref&gt;Stein,  Arthur (1985).  ''Seeds of the Seventies: Values, Work, and Commitment in Post-Vietnam America''. University Press of New England, p.&amp;nbsp;136.  {{ISBN|978-0-87451-343-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholar James R. Lewis counted "Green politics" as one of the New Age's more visible activities.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=11}}  One academic book claims that the [[History of the Green Party of the United States|U.S. Green Party movement]] began as an initiative of a handful of activists including [[Charlene Spretnak]], co-author of a "'new age' interpretation" of the German Green movement (Capra and Spretnak's ''Green Politics''), and Mark Satin, author of ''New Age Politics''.&lt;ref&gt;Ely, John (1998).

Temple University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;200. {{ISBN|978-1-56639-516-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another academic publication says Spretnak and Satin largely co-drafted the U.S. Greens' founding document, the "Ten Key Values" statement.&lt;ref&gt;[[Greta Gaard|Gaard, Greta]] (1998).  ''Ecological Politics: Ecofeminists and the Greens''. Temple University Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;142–143.  {{ISBN|978-1-56639-569-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the 21st century===

[[File:Marianne Williamson.jpg|thumb |180px| right| alt=Head shot of a well-dressed woman with straight black hair |New Age author [[Marianne Williamson]] campaigned for a seat in the U.S. Congress in 2013–2014.]]

While the term "New Age" may have fallen out of favor,{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=74}}{{sfnp|Ray|Anderson|2000|pp=188–189}} scholar [[George Chryssides]] notes that the New Age by whatever name is "still alive and active" in the 21st century.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=22}}  In the realm of politics, New Ager Mark Satin's book ''Radical Middle'' (2004) reached out to mainstream liberals.&lt;ref&gt;Kilgore, Ed (June 2004).  "Good Government: Time to Stop Bashing the Two-Party System". ''[[Washington Monthly]]'', pp.&amp;nbsp;58–59.

"What Works &amp; What Doesn't". ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'', pp.&amp;nbsp;24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;  York (2005) identified "key New Age spokespeople" including [[William Bloom]], [[Satish Kumar]], and [[Starhawk]] who were emphasizing a link between spirituality and environmental consciousness.{{sfn|York|2005|p=28}} Former [[Esalen Institute]] staffer Stephen Dinan's ''Sacred America, Sacred World''  (2016) prompted a long interview of Dinan in ''[[Psychology Today]]'', which called the book a "manifesto for our country's evolution that is both political and deeply spiritual".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Matousek|Matousek, Mark]] (5 August 2016).

In 2013 longtime New Age author Marianne Williamson launched a campaign for a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]], telling ''[[The New York Times]]'' that her type of spirituality was what American politics needed.&lt;ref name=Lovett /&gt;  "America has swerved from its ethical center", she said.&lt;ref name=Lovett&gt;Lovett, Ian (13 November 2013).

==Reception==

===Popular media===

Mainstream periodicals tended to be less than sympathetic; sociologist Paul Ray and psychologist Sherry Anderson discussed in their 2000 book ''[[The Cultural Creatives]]'', what they called the media's "zest for attacking" New Age ideas, and offered the example of a 1996 [[Lance Morrow]] essay in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.{{sfnp|Ray|Anderson|2000|pp=188–189}} Nearly a decade earlier, ''Time'' had run a long cover story critical of New Age culture; the cover featured a head shot of a famous actress beside the headline, "'''Om....''' THE NEW AGE starring Shirley MacLaine, faith healers, channelers, space travelers, and crystals galore".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine (7 December 1987), vol. 130, issue no. 23, front cover.&lt;/ref&gt;  The story itself, by former ''[[The Saturday Evening Post|Saturday Evening Post]]'' editor [[Otto Friedrich]], was sub-titled, "A Strange Mix of Spirituality and Superstition Is Sweeping Across the Country".&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich, Otto (7 December 1987).  "New Age Harmonies".  ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, vol. 130, issue no. 23, pp.&amp;nbsp;62–66.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1988, the magazine ''[[The New Republic]]'' ran a four-page critique of New Age culture and politics by journalist [[Richard Bradley (writer)|Richard Blow]] entitled simply, "Moronic Convergence".&lt;ref&gt;Blow, Richard (25 January 1988).  "Moronic Convergence".  ''[[The New Republic]]'', pp.&amp;nbsp;24–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some New Agers and New Age sympathizers responded to such criticisms.  For example, sympathizers Ray and Anderson said that much of it was an attempt to "stereotype" the movement for idealistic and spiritual change, and to cut back on its popularity.{{sfnp|Ray|Anderson|2000|pp=188–189}} New Age theoretician David Spangler tried to distance himself from what he called the "New Age glamour" of crystals, talk-show channelers, and other easily commercialized phenomena, and sought to underscore his commitment to the New Age as a vision of genuine social transformation.{{sfnp|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=104–105}}

===Academia===
[[File:Wouter Hanegraaff 2006 Alchemy Conference.jpg|thumb|right|One of the first academics to study the New Age was Wouter Hanegraaff]]

Initially, academic interest in the New Age was minimal.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=20}} The earliest academic studies of the New Age phenomenon were performed by specialists in the study of new religious movements such as [[Robert Ellwood]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1992|1p=6|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=3}} This research was often scanty because many scholars regarded the New Age as an insignificant cultural fad.{{sfn|Lewis|Melton|1992|p=x}} Having been influenced by the U.S. [[anti-cult movement]], much of it was also largely negative and critical of New Age groups.{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=15}} The "first truly scholarly study" of the phenomenon was an [[edited volume]] put together by James R. Lewis and J. Gordon Melton in 1992.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=20}} From that point on, the number of published academic studies steadily increased.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=20}}

In 1994, [[Christoph Bochinger]] published his study of the New Age in Germany, ''"New Age" und moderne Religion''.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=20}} This was followed by Michael York's sociological study in 1995 and Richard Kyle's U.S.-focused work in 1995.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=21}} In 1996, Paul Heelas published a sociological study of the movement in Britain, being the first to discuss its relationship with business.{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1p=5|2a1=Hammer|2y=2001|2pp=21–22}} That same year, Wouter Hanegraaff published ''New Age Religion and Western Culture'', a historical analysis of New Age texts;{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=4–6}} Hammer later described it as having "a well-deserved reputation as the standard reference work on the New Age".{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=22}} Most of these early studies were based on a textual analysis of New Age publications, rather than on an [[ethnography|ethnographic]] analysis of its practitioners.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=13}}

Sutcliffe and Gilhus argued that 'New Age studies' could be seen as having experienced two waves; in the first, scholars focused on "macro-level analyses of the content and boundaries" of the "movement", while the second wave featured "more variegated and contextualized studies of particular beliefs and practices".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|Gilhus|2013|p=6}} Sutcliffe and Gilhus have also expressed concern that, as of 2013, 'New Age studies' has yet to formulate a set of research questions scholars can pursue.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|Gilhus|2013|p=6}}
The New Age has proved a challenge for scholars of religion operating under more formative models of what "religion" is.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|Gilhus|2013|p=5}} By 2006, Heelas noted that the New Age was so vast and diverse that no scholar of the subject could hope to keep up with all of it.{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=15}}

===Christian perspectives===

Mainstream Christianity has typically rejected the ideas of the New Age.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=21}} Most published criticism of the New Age has been produced by Christians, particularly those on the religion's [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist wing]].{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=201}} In the United States, the New Age became a major concern of [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian groups in the 1980s, an attitude that came to influence British evangelical groups.{{sfn|Hexham|1992|p=152}} During that decade, evangelical writers such as [[Constance Cumbey]], [[Dave Hunt (Christian apologist)|Dave Hunt]], [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]], and [[Douglas Groothuis]] published books criticising the New Age from their Christian perspective; a number of them have been characterised as propagating [[conspiracy theories]] regarding the origin and purpose of the movement.{{sfn|Hexham|1992|p=154}} The most successful such publication however was [[Frank E. Peretti]]'s 1986 novel ''[[This Present Darkness]]'', which sold over a million copies; it depicted the New Age as being in league with [[feminism]] and secular education as part of a conspiracy to overthrow Christianity.{{sfn|Hexham|1992|p=156}}

Official responses to the New Age have been produced by major Christian organisations like the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Church of England]], and [[Methodist Church]].{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=21}}

There are other Christian groups that have adopted a more positive view of the New Age, among them the [[New Age Catholics]], [[Christaquarians]], and [[Christians Awakening to a New Awareness]], all of which believe that New Age ideas can enhance a person's Christian faith.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|pp=21–22}}

===Contemporary Pagan perspectives===
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="Neopagan practices highlight the centrality of the relationship between humans and nature and reinvent religions of the past, while New Agers are more interested in transforming individual consciousness and shaping the future."|source=— Religious studies scholar Sarah Pike.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=18}} }}

An issue of academic debate has been regarding the connection between the New Age movement and contemporary [[Paganism]], or [[Modern Paganism|Neo-Paganism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kemp|1y=2004|1p=10|2a1=Partridge|2y=2004|2p=79}} The two phenomena have often being confused and conflated, particularly in Christian critiques.{{sfnm|1a1=Kemp|1y=2004|1p=8|2a1=Partridge|2y=2004|2p=79}} Religious studies scholar Sarah Pike asserted that there was a "significant overlap" between the two religious movements,{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=vii}} while [[Aidan A. Kelly]] stated that Paganism "parallels the New Age movement in some ways, differs sharply from it in others, and overlaps it in some minor ways".{{sfn|Kelly|1992|p=136}} Other scholars have identified them as distinct phenomena that share overlap and commonalities.{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=2001|1pp=364–365|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=9}} Hanegraaff suggested that whereas various forms of contemporary Paganism were not part of the New Age movement – particularly those that pre-dated the movement – other Pagan religions and practices could be identified as New Age.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=78}} Partridge portrayed both Paganism and the New Age as different streams of [[occulture]] ([[occult]] culture) that merge at points.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=78}}

Various differences between the two movements have been highlighted; the New Age movement focuses on an improved future, whereas the focus of Paganism is on the pre-Christian past.{{sfn|Kelly|1992|p=138}} Similarly, the New Age movement typically propounds a [[Universalism|universalist]] message that sees all religions as fundamentally the same, whereas Paganism stresses the difference between [[Monotheism|monotheistic religions]] and those embracing a [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] or [[Animism|animistic]] theology.{{sfn|Kelly|1992|p=138}} While the New Age emphasises a light-centred image, Paganism acknowledges both light and dark, life and death, and recognises the savage side of the natural world.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=79}} Many Pagans have sought to distance themselves from the New Age movement, even using "New Age" as an insult within their community, while conversely many involved in the New Age have expressed criticism of Paganism for emphasizing the material world over the spiritual.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=9}}
Many Pagans have expressed criticism of the high fees charged by New Age teachers, something not typically present in the Pagan movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Kelly|1y=1992|1p=139|2a1=Partridge|2y=2004|2p=79}} with some Pagans pronouncing the word "newage" to rhyme with "[[sewage]]".{{sfn|Blain|Wallis|2007|p=6}}

===Non-Western and indigenous responses===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="In the case of New Age, its solipsism, coupled with its advocacy of free market principles, opens the world's spiritual arena as an opportunity for spiritual exploitation and even capitalistic imperialism. Not only does it encourage a paradoxical homogenizing to the cultural standards of North Atlantic civilization, exemplified in its affirmation that 'we are all one', but it also carries an implicit judgement of inferior status for non-hegemonic cultures, inasmuch as they are not considered to be the ones who decide what is to be shared and what is not."|source=— Sociologist Michael York.{{sfn|York|2001|pp=367–368}} }}

One of the most contentious aspects of the New Age has been its adoption of spiritual ideas and practises from other, particularly non-Western cultures.{{sfn|York|2001|p=367}} Its belief that all traditions are free for anyone to use, rather than the [[private property]] of particular communities, has resulted in New Agers adopting and marketing the practices of [[Third World]] societies.{{sfn|York|2001|p=368}} These have included "Hawaiian [[Kahuna]] magic, Australian Aboriginal dream-working, South American Amerindian ''[[ayahuasca]]'' and ''San Pedro'' ceremony, Hindu Ayurveda and yoga, and Chinese Feng Shui, [[Qigong|Qi Gong]], and [[Tai chi|Tai Chi]]".{{sfn|York|2001|p=368}}

The New Age has been accused of [[cultural imperialism]], [[cultural appropriation|misappropriating]] the sacred ceremonies, and abuse of the intellectual and cultural property of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"&gt;Mesteth, Wilmer, et al (June 10, 1993) "[http://www.thepeoplespaths.net/articles/ladecwar.htm Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality]."

===Political writers and activists===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="New Age politics might be seen not as a wayward, pathological creature of the New Left's imagination, but as a political innocent in candid, questioning dialogue with the unclaimed mainstream territory of progressive, rather than atomistic, individualism.  Indeed, if we were to examine some of the social and political threads that run through the aery fabric of New Age thinking, we would find certain themes that resonate with the necessary conditions for a left version of progressive individualism.  Generally speaking, New Age addresses its adherents as active participants, with a measure of control over their everyday lives. ...  The New Age 'person' is also in many respects an individual whose personal growth is indissociable from the environment; a link fleshed out in a variety of ecotopian stories and romances.  So, too, the small-scale imperative of New Age's cooperative communitarianism brings with it a host of potentially critical positions. ..."|source=— Scholar of cultural studies [[Andrew Ross (sociologist)|Andrew Ross]], 1991.{{sfn|Ross|1991|p=69}} }}

Toward the end of the 20th century, some social and political analysts and activists were arguing that the New Age political perspective had something to offer mainstream society.&lt;ref&gt;Gerzon, Mark (1996).  ''A House Divided: Six Belief Systems Struggling for America's Soul''.  A Jeremy P. Tarcher Putnam Book / G. P. Putnam's Sons, Chap. 5 ("Gaia: The Transformation State").  {{ISBN|978-0-87477-823-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayne (1999), cited above, Chap. 11 ("Spiritual Politics").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ray and Anderson (2000), cited above, Chap. 7 ("A Great Current of Change").&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, some political scientists launched the "Section on Ecological and Transformational Politics" of the [[American Political Science Association]],&lt;ref&gt;"Preface: Paths to Transformational Politics".  In Woolpert, Stephen; Slaton, Christa Daryl; and Schwerin, Edward W., eds. (1998).  ''Transformational Politics: Theory, Study, and Practice''.  State University of New York Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;ix–xi.  {{ISBN|978-0-7914-3945-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and an academic book prepared by three of them stated that the "transformational politics" concept was meant to subsume such terms as ''new age'' and ''new paradigm''.&lt;ref&gt;Slaton, Christa Daryl; Woolpert, Stephen; Schwerin, Ed.  "Introduction: What Is Transformational Politics?"   In Woolpert et al. (1998), cited above, p.&amp;nbsp;xix.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, scholar of cultural studies [[Andrew Ross (sociologist)|Andrew Ross]] suggested that New Age political ideas – however muddled and naïve – could help [[Progressivism in the United States#Progressivism in the 21st century|progressives]] construct an appealing alternative to both atomistic individualism and self-denying collectivism. {{sfn|Ross|1991|pp=65–72 ("New Age politics" sub-chapter)}}  In 2005, British researcher Stuart Rose urged scholars of alternative religions to pay more attention to the New Age's interest in such topics as "new socio-political thinking" and "New Economics",{{sfn|Rose|2005b|p=165}} topics Rose discussed in his book ''Transforming the World: Bringing the New Age Into Focus'', issued by a European academic publisher.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Stuart (2005).  ''Transforming the World: Bringing the New Age Into Focus''. [[Peter Lang (publisher)|Peter Lang]], Chap. 8 ("Community Activity").  {{ISBN|978-0-8204-7241-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other political thinkers and activists saw New Age politics less positively.  On the political right, author [[George Weigel]] argued that New Age politics was just a retooled and pastel-colored version of leftism.&lt;ref&gt;Weigel, George (March 1989).  "No Options".  ''American Purpose'', vol. 3, no. 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservative evangelical writer Douglas Groothuis, discussed by scholars Hexham{{sfn|Hexham|1992| p=54}} and Kemp,{{sfn|Kemp|2004| p=52}} warned that New Age politics could lead to an oppressive world government.&lt;ref&gt;Groothuis, Douglas (1987).  "Politics: Building an International Platform".  In Hoyt, Karen, ed., ''The New Age Rage''. Fleming H. Revell Company / Baker Publishing Group, pp.&amp;nbsp;92–93 and 103–105.  {{ISBN|978-0-8007-5257-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the left, scholars argued that New Age politics was an oxymoron: that personal growth has little or nothing to do with political change.&lt;ref&gt;Jamison, Andrew (2001).  ''The Making of Green Knowledge: Environmental Politics and Cultural Transformation''.  Cambridge University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;169.  {{ISBN|978-0-521-79252-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Slavoj Žižek|Žižek, Slavoj]] (2000).  ''The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology''.  Verso Books, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–2 and 70.  {{ISBN|978-1-85984-291-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  One political scientist said New Age politics fails to recognize the reality of economic and political power.&lt;ref&gt;Boggs, Carl (2000).  ''The End of Politics: Corporate Power and the Decline of the Public Sphere''.  Guilford Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;170–72.  {{ISBN|978-1-57230-504-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another academic, [[Dana L. Cloud]], wrote a lengthy critique of New Age politics as a political ideology;&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, Dana L. (1998). ''Control and Consolation in American Culture and Politics: Rhetorics of Therapy''. Sage Publications, Chap. 6 ("The New Age of Post-Marxism").  {{ISBN|978-0-7619-0506-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; she faulted it for not being opposed to the [[capitalist system]], or to liberal individualism.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud (1998), cited above, pp.&amp;nbsp;144, 147–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism of New Age often made by leftists is that its focus on individualism deflects participants from engaging in socio-political activism.{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=8}} This perspective regards New Age as a manifestation of consumerism that promotes [[elitism]] and indulgence by allowing wealthier people to affirm their socio-economic status through consuming New Age products and therapies.{{sfn|Heelas|2006|pp=6–7}}  New Agers who do engage in socio-political activism have also been criticized.  Journalist [[Harvey Wasserman]] suggested that New Age activists were too averse to social conflict to be effective politically.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, Harvey (31 August 1985). "The New Age Movement: The Politics of Transcendence".  ''[[The Nation]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;147 (discussing the ideas of activist Shelly Kellman).&lt;/ref&gt; Melton et al. found that New Age activists' commitment to the often frustrating process of consensus decision-making led to "extended meetings and minimal results",{{sfn|Melton|1990| p=324}} and a pair of futurists concluded that one once-promising New Age activist group had been both "too visionary and too vague" to last.&lt;ref&gt;Lipnack, Jessica; Stamps, Jeffrey (1982).

{{nuclear weapons}}
'''Nuclear fallout''', or '''fallout''', is the residual radioactive material propelled into the upper atmosphere following a [[nuclear explosion|nuclear blast]], so called because it "falls out" of the sky after the explosion and the [[shock wave]] have passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/Effects/effects17.shtml|title=Radioactive Fallout {{!}} Effects of Nuclear Weapons {{!}} atomicarchive.com|website=www.atomicarchive.com|access-date=2016-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It commonly refers to the [[radioactive]] dust and ash created when a [[nuclear weapon]] explodes.  Fallout is usually limited to the immediate area, and can only spread for hundreds of miles from the explosion site if the explosion is high enough in the atmosphere. Fallout may get [[Entrainment (meteorology)|entrained]] with the products of a [[pyrocumulus]] cloud and fall as black rain&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://atomicbombmuseum.org/3_radioactivity.shtml|title=AtomicBombMuseum.org - Destructive Effects|website=atomicbombmuseum.org|access-date=2016-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; (rain darkened by soot and other particulates).

This radioactive dust, usually consisting of [[fission product]]s mixed with bystanding atoms that are [[neutron activation|neutron activated by exposure]], is a highly dangerous kind of [[radioactive contamination]].

==Types of fallout==
[[Image:Radiocarbon bomb spike.svg|thumb|right|Atmospheric nuclear weapon tests almost doubled the concentration of radioactive [[Carbon-14|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], before levels slowly declined following the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]].]]

An [[air burst]] (that is, a nuclear detonation far above the surface) can produce fallout across whole regions, countries or worldwide, but the longer it travels, the weaker it becomes.  A [[ground burst]] can produce much more severe, local fallout.

===Global fallout===
After an [[air burst]], [[Nuclear fission|fission]] products, un-fissioned nuclear material, and weapon residues vaporized by the heat of the fireball condense into a fine suspension of small particles 10 [[nanometre|nm]] to 20 [[micrometre|µm]] in diameter. These particles may be quickly drawn up into the [[stratosphere]], particularly if the explosive yield exceeds 10 [[kiloton|kt]].

Initially little was known about the dispersion of nuclear fallout on a global scale. The [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|AEC]] assumed that fallout would be dispersed evenly across the globe by atmospheric winds and gradually settle to the Earth's surface after weeks, months, and even years as worldwide fallout.

The radio-biological hazard of worldwide fallout is a long-term one because of the potential accumulation of long-lived [[radionuclide|radioisotopes]] (such as [[strontium-90]] and [[caesium-137]]) in the body as a result of ingestion of foods containing the radioactive materials. Because they are dispersed, levels of these isotopes are small for individual nuclear events. Local fallout is more concentrated and of far more immediate concern.

===Local fallout===
In a land or water [[ground burst|surface burst]], heat [[vapor]]izes large amounts of earth or water, which is drawn up into the [[mushroom cloud|radioactive cloud]]. This material becomes radioactive when it condenses with [[fission products]] and other radiocontaminants that have become [[neutron activation|neutron-activated]]. The table below summarizes the abilities of common isotopes to form fallout. Some radiation taints large amounts of land and [[drinking water]] causing formal [[mutation]]s throughout animal and human life.

[[Image:US fallout exposure.png|right|thumb|Per capita [[thyroid]] doses in the continental United States resulting from all exposure routes from all atmospheric [[nuclear testing|nuclear tests]] conducted at the [[Nevada Test Site]] from 1951-1962.]]
A surface burst generates large amounts of particulate matter, composed of particles from less than 100 [[nanometre|nm]] to several millimeters in diameter—in addition to very fine particles that contribute to worldwide fallout. The larger particles spill out of the stem and cascade down the outside of the fireball in a downdraft even as the cloud rises, so fallout begins to arrive near [[ground zero]] within an hour. More than half the total bomb debris lands on the ground within about 24 hours as local fallout. Chemical properties of the elements in the fallout control the rate at which they are deposited on the ground. Less volatile elements deposit first.

Severe local fallout contamination can extend far beyond the blast and thermal effects, particularly in the case of high yield surface detonations. The ground track of fallout from an explosion depends on the weather from the time of detonation onwards. In stronger winds, fallout travels faster but takes the same time to descend, so although it covers a larger path, it is more spread out or diluted. Thus, the width of the fallout pattern for any given dose rate is reduced where the downwind distance is increased by higher winds. The total amount of activity deposited up to any given time is the same irrespective of the wind pattern, so overall casualty figures from fallout are generally independent of winds. But [[thunderstorm]]s can bring down activity as [[rain]] more rapidly than dry fallout, particularly if the [[mushroom cloud]] is low enough to be below ("washout"), or mixed with ("rainout"), the thunderstorm.

Whenever individuals remain in a [[radioactive contamination|radiologically contaminated]] area, such contamination leads to an immediate external radiation exposure as well as a possible later internal hazard from inhalation and ingestion of radiocontaminants, such as the rather short-lived [[iodine-131]], which is accumulated in the [[thyroid]].

==Factors affecting fallout==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:1957.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Nevada nuclear test total fallout outdoor gamma doses, 1950–57. The fallout is to the north and east because testing was only allowed when the wind was blowing in those directions.]] --&gt;

===Location===
There are two main considerations for the location of an explosion: height and surface composition. A nuclear weapon detonated in the air, called an [[air burst]], produces less fallout than a comparable explosion near the ground.

In case of water surface bursts, the particles tend to be rather lighter and smaller, producing less local fallout but extending over a greater area. The particles contain mostly [[sea salt]]s with some water; these can have a [[cloud seeding]] effect causing local [[rainout]] and areas of high local fallout. Fallout from a [[seawater]] burst is difficult to remove once it has soaked into [[porous]] surfaces because the fission products are present as metallic [[ion]]s that chemically bond to many surfaces. Water and detergent washing effectively removes less than 50% of this chemically bonded activity from [[concrete]] or [[steel]]. Complete decontamination requires aggressive treatment like [[sandblasting]], or acidic treatment. After the ''Crossroads'' underwater test, it was found that wet fallout must be immediately removed from ships by continuous water washdown (such as from the [[fire sprinkler]] system on the decks).

Parts of the sea bottom may become fallout. After the [[Castle Bravo]] test, white dust—contaminated [[calcium oxide]] particles originating from pulverized and [[calcination|calcined]] [[coral]]s—fell for several hours, causing [[beta burn]]s and radiation exposure to the inhabitants of the nearby atolls and the crew of the ''[[Daigo Fukuryū Maru]]'' fishing boat. The scientists called the fallout ''Bikini snow''.

For subsurface bursts, there is an additional phenomenon present called "[[base surge]]". The base surge is a cloud that rolls outward from the bottom of the subsiding column, which is caused by an excessive density of dust or water droplets in the air. For underwater bursts, the visible surge is, in effect, a cloud of liquid (usually water) droplets with the property of flowing almost as if it were a homogeneous fluid. After the water evaporates, an invisible base surge of small radioactive particles may persist.

For subsurface land bursts, the surge is made up of small solid particles, but it still behaves like a [[fluid]]. A soil earth medium favors base surge formation in an underground burst. Although the base surge typically contains only about 10% of the total bomb debris in a subsurface burst, it can create larger radiation doses than fallout near the detonation, because it arrives sooner than fallout, before much radioactive decay has occurred.

===Meteorological===
[[Image:Fallout G&amp;D77.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Comparison of fallout gamma dose and dose rate contours for a 1 Mt fission land surface burst, based on DELFIC calculations. Because of radioactive decay, the dose rate contours contract after fallout has arrived, but dose contours continue to grow]]

[[Meteorology|Meteorological]] conditions greatly influence fallout, particularly local fallout. Atmospheric winds are able to bring fallout over large areas. For example, as a result of a ''[[Castle Bravo]]'' surface burst of a 15 Mt thermonuclear device at [[Bikini Atoll]] on March 1, 1954, a roughly cigar-shaped area of the [[Pacific]] extending over 500&amp;nbsp;km downwind and varying in width to a maximum of 100&amp;nbsp;km was severely contaminated. There are three very different versions of the fallout pattern from this test, because the fallout was only measured on a small number of widely spaced Pacific Atolls. The two alternative versions both ascribe the high radiation levels at north [[Rongelap]] to a downwind hotspot caused by the large amount of radioactivity carried on fallout particles of about 50-100 micrometres size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=General Electric Company|author=Howard A. Hawthorne, Editor|title=COMPILATION OF LOCAL FALLOUT DATA FROM TEST DETONATIONS 1945-1962 - EXTRACTED FROM DASA 1251 - Volume II - Oceanic U.S. Tests|date=May 1979| url=http://worf.eh.doe.gov/data/ihp1d/1362e.pdf| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410131321/http://worf.eh.doe.gov/data/ihp1d/1362e.pdf| archivedate=2008-04-10}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Bravo'', it was discovered that fallout landing on the ocean disperses in the top water layer (above the [[thermocline]] at 100 m depth), and the land equivalent dose rate can be calculated by multiplying the ocean dose rate at two days after burst by a factor of about 530. In other 1954 tests, including ''Yankee'' and ''Nectar,'' hotspots were mapped out by ships with submersible probes, and similar hotspots occurred in 1956 tests such as ''Zuni'' and ''Tewa''.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=US Naval Radiological Defense Laboratory|author=Project Officer T. Triffet, P. D. LaRiviere|title=OPERATION REDWING - Project 2.63, Characterization of Fallout - Pacific Proving Grounds, May-July 1956|date=March 1961|url=http://worf.eh.doe.gov/data/ihp1c/0881_a.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410131256/http://worf.eh.doe.gov/data/ihp1c/0881_a.pdf|archivedate=2008-04-10}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, the major U.S. '[[DELFIC]]' (Defence Land Fallout Interpretive Code) computer calculations use the natural size distributions of particles in soil instead of the [[afterwind]] sweep-up spectrum, and this results in more straightforward fallout patterns lacking the downwind hotspot.

[[Snow]] and [[rain]], especially if they come from considerable heights, accelerate local fallout. Under special meteorological conditions, such as a local rain shower that originates above the radioactive cloud, limited areas of heavy contamination just downwind of a nuclear blast may be formed.

==Effects==
A wide range of [[biological process|biological]] changes may follow the irradiation of animals. These vary from rapid death following high doses of penetrating whole-body radiation, to essentially normal lives for a variable period of time until the development of delayed radiation effects, in a portion of the exposed population, following low dose exposures.

The unit of actual ''exposure'' is the [[Roentgen (unit)|röntgen]], defined in [[ionisation]]s per unit volume of air. All ionisation based instruments (including [[geiger counter]]s and [[ionisation chamber]]s) measure exposure. However, effects depend on the energy per unit mass, not the exposure measured in air. A deposit of 1 joule per kilogram has the unit of 1 [[gray (unit)|gray]] (Gy). For 1 MeV energy gamma rays, an exposure of 1 röntgen in air produces a dose of about 0.01 gray (1 centigray, cGy) in water or surface tissue. Because of shielding by the tissue surrounding the bones, the [[bone marrow]] only receives about 0.67 cGy when the air exposure is 1 röntgen and the surface skin dose is 1 cGy. Some lower values reported for the amount of radiation that would kill 50% of personnel (the {{LD50}}) refer to bone marrow dose, which is only 67% of the air dose.

===Short term===

[[File:Fallout shelter sign on a building.JPG|thumb|[[Fallout shelter]] sign on a building in [[New York City]].]]
The dose that would be lethal to 50% of a population is a common parameter used to compare the effects of various fallout types or circumstances. Usually, the term is defined for a specific time, and limited to studies of acute lethality. The common time periods used are 30 days or less for most small laboratory animals and to 60 days for large animals and humans. The LD&lt;Sub&gt;50&lt;/Sub&gt; figure assumes that the individuals did not receive other injuries or medical treatment.

In the 1950s, the LD&lt;Sub&gt;50&lt;/Sub&gt; for gamma rays was set at 3.5 Gy, while under more dire conditions of war (a bad diet, little medical care, poor nursing) the LD&lt;Sub&gt;50&lt;/Sub&gt; was 2.5 Gy (250 rad). There have been few documented cases of survival beyond 6 Gy. One person at [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] survived a dose of more than 10 Gy, but many of the persons exposed there were not uniformly exposed over their entire body. If a person is exposed in a non-homogeneous manner then a given dose (averaged over the entire body) is less likely to be lethal. For instance, if a person gets a hand/low arm dose of 100 Gy, which gives them an overall dose of 4 Gy, they are more likely to survive than a person who gets a 4 Gy dose over their entire body. A hand dose of 10 Gy or more would likely result in loss of the hand. A [[United Kingdom|British]] industrial [[radiographer]] who was estimated to have received a hand dose of 100 Gy over the course of his lifetime lost his hand because of [[radiation dermatitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://oem.bmj.com/content/51/10/713.full.pdf|title=Death of a classified worker probably caused by overexposure to gamma radiation|journal=British Medical Journal|year=1994|volume=54|pages=713–718}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most people become ill after an exposure to 1 Gy or more. The [[fetus]]es of [[pregnant]] women are often more vulnerable to radiation and may [[miscarriage|miscarry]], especially in the first [[Trimester (pregnancy)|trimester]].

One hour after a surface burst, the radiation from fallout in the [[Subsidence crater|crater]] region is 30 grays per hour (Gy/h).{{Clarify|date=February 2008}} Civilian [[dose rate]]s in peacetime range from 30 to 100 µGy per year.

Fallout radiation decays relatively quickly with time. Most areas become fairly safe for travel and decontamination after three to five weeks.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

For [[nuclear weapon yield|yields]] of up to 10 [[kiloton|kt]], prompt radiation is the dominant producer of casualties on the battlefield. Humans receiving an acute incapacitating dose (30 Gy) have their performance degraded almost immediately and become ineffective within several hours. However, they do not die until five to six days after exposure, assuming they do not receive any other injuries. Individuals receiving less than a total of 1.5 Gy are not incapacitated. People receiving doses greater than 1.5 Gy become disabled, and some eventually die.

A dose of 5.3 Gy to 8.3 Gy is considered lethal but not immediately incapacitating. Personnel exposed to this amount of radiation have their cognitive performance degraded in two to three hours,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170125171152/https://ke.army.mil/bordeninstitute/published_volumes/nuclearwarfare/chapter1/chapter1.pdf NUCLEAR EVENTS AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES  by the Borden institute.

Chapter 7 BEHAVIORAL AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES WITH EXPOSURE TO IONIZING RADIATION ]&lt;/ref&gt; depending on how physically demanding the tasks they must perform are, and remain in this disabled state at least two days. However, at that point they experience a recovery period and can perform non-demanding tasks for about six days, after which they relapse for about four weeks. At this time they begin exhibiting symptoms of [[radiation poisoning]] of sufficient severity to render them totally ineffective. Death follows at approximately six weeks after exposure, although outcomes may vary.

Late or delayed effects of radiation occur following a wide range of doses and dose rates. Delayed effects may appear months to years after [[irradiation]] and include a wide variety of effects involving almost all tissues or organs. Some of the ''possible'' delayed consequences of radiation injury, with the rates above the background prevalence, depending on the absorbed dose, include [[carcinogenesis]], [[cataract]] formation, chronic [[radiodermatitis]], decreased [[fertility]], and [[genetic mutation]]s.&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;{{citation |title=Fallout from Nuclear Weapons Tests and Cancer Risks |publisher=American Scientist | first1=Steven L. | last1=Simon | first2=André | last2=Bouville | first3=Charles E. | last3=Land |volume=94 |issue=1 |pages=48–57 |year=2006|url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/Fallout-PDF }}{{better source|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, the only [[teratological]] effect observed in humans following nuclear attacks on highly populated areas is [[microcephaly]] which is the only proven malformation, or congenital abnormality, found in the [[in utero]] developing human fetuses present during the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. Of all the pregnant women who were close enough to be exposed to the ''prompt'' burst of intense neutron and gamma doses in the two cities, the total number of children born with [[microcephaly]] was below 50.&lt;ref name="books.google.ie"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DykKlVU0V-oC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=microcephaly+hiroshima#v=onepage&amp;q=microcephaly%20hiroshima&amp;f=false Teratology in the Twentieth Century Plus Ten]&lt;/ref&gt; No statistically demonstrable increase of congenital malformations was found among the ''later conceived children'' born to survivors of the nuclear detonations at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.&lt;ref name="books.google.ie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/268/5/661.short JAMA Network | JAMA | The Children of Atomic Bomb Survivors: A Genetic Study&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/bjc/journal/v88/n3/full/6600748a.html "Sex ratio among offspring of childhood cancer survivors treated with radiotherapy"].

The [[Baby Tooth Survey]] founded by the husband and wife team of physicians [[Eric Reiss]] and [[Louise Reiss]], was a research effort focused on detecting the presence of [[strontium-90]], a [[carcinogenic|cancer-causing]] radioactive isotope created by the more than 400 atomic tests conducted above ground that is absorbed from water and dairy products into the bones and teeth given its chemical similarity to [[calcium]]. The team sent collection forms to schools in the [[St. Louis, Missouri]] area, hoping to gather 50,000 teeth each year. Ultimately, the project collected over 300,000 teeth from children of various ages before the project was ended in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [https://www.nytimes.com/1959/03/19/archives/teeth-to-measure-fallout.html "Teeth to Measure Fall-Out"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 18, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preliminary results of the Baby Tooth Survey were published in the November 24, 1961, edition of the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', and showed that levels of [[strontium 90]] had risen steadily in children born in the 1950s, with those born later showing the most pronounced increases.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Walter. [https://www.nytimes.com/1961/11/25/archives/babies-surveyed-for-strontium-90-ratio-to-calcium-in-bones-is.html "Babies Surveyed for Strontium 90; Ratio to Calcium in Bones Is Discovered to Be Low A survey has shown that pregnant mothers and their unborn children absorb radioactive strontium, as a substitute for calcium, only about 10 per cent of the time"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 25, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; The results of a more comprehensive study of the elements found in the teeth collected showed that children born after 1963 had levels of strontium 90 in their baby teeth that was 50 times higher than that found in children born before large-scale atomic testing began. The findings helped convince U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] to sign the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] with the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Soviet Union]], which ended the above-ground [[nuclear weapons testing]] that created the greatest amounts of atmospheric nuclear fallout.&lt;ref name=Reiss&gt;Hevesi, Dennis. [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/science/10reiss.html "Dr. Louise Reiss, Who Helped Ban Atomic Testing, Dies at 90"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The baby tooth survey was a "campaign [that] effectively employed a variety of media advocacy strategies" to alarm the public and "galvanized" support against atmospheric nuclear testing,&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.668.4804&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Gerl, E. (2014). Scientist-citizen advocacy in the atomic age: A case study of the Baby Tooth Survey, 1958-1963.]&lt;/ref&gt; with putting an end to such testing being commonly viewed as a positive outcome for a myriad of other reasons. The survey could not show then at the time, nor in the decades that have elapsed, that the levels of global strontium-90 or fallout in general, were in any way life-threatening, primarily because "50 times the strontium-90 from ''before'' nuclear testing" is a minuscule number, and multiplication of minuscule numbers results in only a slightly larger minuscule number. Moreover, the [[Radiation and Public Health Project]] which currently retains the teeth has had their stance and publications heavily criticized: A 2003 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' states that the group's work has been controversial and has little credibility with the scientific establishment.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in an April 2014 article in ''Popular Science'', Sarah Fecht explains that the group's work, specifically the widely discussed case of [[cherry-picking]] data to suggest that fallout from the [[Radiation and Public Health Project#Fukushima|2011 Fukushima accident caused infant deaths]] in America, is "[[junk science]]", as despite their papers being peer-reviewed, all independent attempts to corroborate their results return findings that are not in agreement with what the organization suggests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/what-can-we-do-about-junk-science-16674140|title=What Can We Do About Junk Science|date=2014-04-08|publisher=Popular Science|author=Sarah Fecht|accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization had earlier also tried [[Ernest J. Sternglass#Three Mile Island|to suggest the same thing occurred after the 1979 Three Mile Island]] accident but this was likewise exposed to be without merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Fallout protection==
{{Main|Fallout shelter}}
{{See also|Fallout Protection|Nuclear warfare#Survival|nuclear famine}}
During the [[Cold War]], the governments of the U.S., the USSR, Great Britain, and China attempted to educate their citizens about surviving a nuclear attack by providing procedures on minimizing short-term exposure to fallout. This effort commonly became known as [[Civil Defense]].

Fallout protection is almost exclusively concerned with protection from radiation. Radiation from a fallout is encountered in the forms of [[Radiation#Alpha|alpha]], [[Radiation#Beta|beta]], and [[Radiation#Gamma|gamma]] radiation, and as ordinary clothing affords protection from alpha and beta radiation,&lt;ref name=NWSSD&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|page=44|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p916.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; most fallout protection measures deal with reducing exposure to gamma radiation.&lt;ref name=NWSSA&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|page=131|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p926.htm#Message2481}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the purposes of radiation shielding, many materials have a characteristic ''halving thickness'': the thickness of a layer of a material sufficient to reduce gamma radiation exposure by 50%. Halving thicknesses of common materials include: 1&amp;nbsp;cm (0.4&amp;nbsp;inch) of lead, 6&amp;nbsp;cm (2.4&amp;nbsp;inches) of concrete, 9&amp;nbsp;cm (3.6&amp;nbsp;inches) of packed earth or 150&amp;nbsp;m (500&amp;nbsp;ft) of air. When multiple thicknesses are built, the shielding is additive. A practical fallout shield is ten halving-thicknesses of a given material, such as 90&amp;nbsp;cm (36&amp;nbsp;inches) of packed earth, which reduces gamma ray exposure by approximately 1024 times (2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.derose.net/steve/guides/emergency/hardened.html|title=Halving-thickness for various materials|publisher="The Compass DeRose Guide to Emergency Preparedness - Hardened Shelters"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NWSS2&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=11–20|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p912.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shelter built with these materials for the purposes of fallout protection is known as a [[fallout shelter]].

=== Personal Protective Equipment  ===
As the nuclear energy sector continues to grow, the international rhetoric surrounding nuclear warfare intensifies, and the ever-present threat of radioactive materials falling into the hands of dangerous people persists, many scientists are working hard to find the best way to protect human organs from the harmful effects of high energy radiation. [[Acute radiation syndrome|Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)]] is the most immediate risk to humans when exposed to [[ionizing radiation]] in dosages greater than around 0.1 [[Gray (unit)|Gy/hr]]. Radiation in the low energy spectrum ([[Alpha Radiation|alpha]] and [[Beta Radiation|beta radiation]]) with minimal penetrating power are unlikely to cause significant damage to internal organs. The high penetrating power of [[Gamma Radiation|gamma]] and [[neutron radiation]], however, easily penetrates the skin and many thin shielding mechanisms to cause cellular degeneration in the stem cells found in bone marrow. While full body shielding in a secure fallout shelter as described above is the most optimal form of radiation protection, it requires being locked in a very thick bunker for a significant amount of time. In the event of a nuclear catastrophe of any kind, it is imperative to have [[Radiation protection#Externally Penetrating Radiation Protective Equipment|mobile protection equipment]] for medical and security personnel to perform necessary containment, evacuation, and any number of other important public safety objectives. The mass of the shielding material required to properly protect the entire body from high energy radiation would make functional movement essentially impossible. This has led scientists to begin researching the idea of partial body protection: a strategy inspired by [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)]]. The idea is to use enough shielding material to sufficiently protect the high concentration of bone marrow in the pelvic region, which contains enough regenerative stem cells to repopulate the body with unaffected bone marrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waterman|first=Gideon|last2=Kase|first2=Kenneth|last3=Orion|first3=Itzhak|last4=Broisman|first4=Andrey|last5=Milstein|first5=Oren|date=29 March 2017|title=Selective Shielding of Bone Marrow: An Approach to Protecting Humans from External Gamma Radiation|url=https://journals.lww.com/health-physics/Abstract/2017/09000/Selective_Shielding_of_Bone_Marrow___An_Approach.4.aspx|journal=The Radiation Safety Journal: Health Physics|volume=113|pages=195–208|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More information on bone marrow shielding can be found in the [https://journals.lww.com/health-physics/pages/default.aspx Health Physics Radiation Safety Journal] article [https://journals.lww.com/health-physics/Abstract/2017/09000/Selective_Shielding_of_Bone_Marrow___An_Approach.4.aspx Selective Shielding of Bone Marrow: An Approach to Protecting Humans from External Gamma Radiation], or in the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)]] and the [[Nuclear Energy Agency|Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA)]]'s 2015 report: [https://www.oecd-nea.org/rp/docs/2014/crpph-r2014-5.pdf Occupational Radiation Protection in Severe Accident Management.]

===The Seven Ten Rule===
The danger of radiation from fallout also decreases with time, as radioactivity decays exponentially with time, such that for each factor of seven increase in time, the radiation is reduced by a factor of ten.  For example, after 7 hours, the average [[dose rate]] is reduced by a factor of ten; after 49 hours, it is reduced by a further factor of ten (to 1/100th); after two weeks the radiation from the fallout will have reduced by a factor of 1000 compared the initial level; and after 14 weeks the average dose rate will have reduced to 1/10,000th of the initial level.&lt;ref name=NWSS2 /&gt;

==Nuclear reactor accident==
{{See also|Comparison of Chernobyl and other radioactivity releases}}
Fallout can also refer to [[nuclear accident]]s, although a [[nuclear reactor]] does not explode like a nuclear weapon. The [[isotopic signature]] of bomb fallout is very different from the fallout from a serious power reactor accident (such as [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] or [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|Fukushima]]).

The key differences are in [[volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] and [[half-life]].

===Volatility===
The [[boiling point]] of an [[chemical element|element]] (or its [[chemical compound|compound]]s) is able to control the percentage of that element a power reactor accident releases. The ability of an element to form a solid controls the rate it is deposited on the ground after having been injected into the atmosphere by a nuclear detonation or accident.

===Half-life===
A [[half life]] is the time it takes half of the radiation of a specific substance to decay. A large amount of short-lived isotopes such as &lt;sup&gt;97&lt;/sup&gt;Zr are present in bomb fallout. This isotope and other short-lived isotopes are constantly generated in a power reactor, but because the [[critical mass|criticality]] occurs over a long length of time, the majority of these short lived isotopes decay before they can be released.

The '''Obelisk of Axum''' ({{lang-am|የአክሱም ሐውልት}}) is a 4th-century AD, 24-metre-tall (79-feet) [[granite]] [[stele]]/[[obelisk]], weighing 160&amp;nbsp;[[tonne]]s, in the city of [[Axum]] in [[Ethiopia]]. It is ornamented with two false [[door]]s at the base and features decorations resembling [[window]]s on all sides. The obelisk ends in a semi-circular top part, which used to be enclosed by metal frames.

==History==

===Overview===
The obelisk—properly termed a "[[stele]]" or, in the local [[Afro-Asiatic languages]], ''hawelt/hawelti'' (as it is not topped by a pyramid)&amp;nbsp;— is found along with many other stelae in the city of [[Axum]] in modern-day [[Ethiopia]]. The stelae were probably carved and erected during the 4th century A.D. by subjects of the [[Kingdom of Aksum]], an ancient Ethiopian civilization. Erection of stelae in Axum was a very old practice (today it is still possible to see primitive roughly carved stelae near more elaborated "obelisks"), probably borrowed from the Kushitic kingdom of [[Meroe]]. Their function is supposed to be that of "markers" for underground burial chambers. The largest of the grave markers were for royal burial chambers and were decorated with multi-story false windows and false doors, while lesser nobility would have smaller, less decorated ones. While there are only a few large ones standing, there are hundreds of smaller ones in various "stelae fields". The last stele erected in Axum was probably the so-called [[King Ezana's Stele]], in the 4th century A.D.
[[File:2 giugno 2002-Axum.JPG|thumb|left|220px|The Obelisk of Axum in [[Rome]] in 2002, before its repatriation.]]

King [[Ezana]] (c.321&amp;nbsp;– c. 360), influenced by his childhood tutor [[Saint Frumentius|Frumentius]], introduced [[Christianity]] to Axum, precluding the [[Paganism|pagan]] practice of erecting burial stelae (it seems that at the feet of each obelisk, together with the grave, there was also a sacrificial altar).

Over the course of time, many of these stelae fell to the ground&lt;ref&gt;Poissonnier B. (2012) [https://www.academia.edu/3439296/_2014 The giant stelae of Aksum in the light of the 1999 excavations], in Fauvelle-Aymar F.-X.(ed.), ''Palethnology of Africa, P@lethnology'', '''4''', 49-86.&lt;/ref&gt; due to: structural collapse (as, probably, in the case of the Great Stele, measuring 33 m), possibly immediately after their erection; earthquakes (Axum is in a [[seismic zone]]); or the military incursions of the Imam [[Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi|Ahmad Gragn]] during the [[Ethiopian-Adal War]] from 1529 to 1543. In the 19th century, of the three major "royal" stelae, only [[King Ezana's Stele]] remained erect, shown in the painting "Sight of Axum" of [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]] (1780–1827).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

At the end of 1935, following the Italian occupation, Italian soldiers found the Obelisk of Axum was collapsed and broken. It had fallen in the 4th century and had broken into five pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url= http://www.unesco.org/culture/laws/pdf/abstract_scovazzi.pdf |format= pdf |publisher= UNESCO |first= Tullio |last= Scovazzi |date= April 2008 |title= The return of the Axum Obelisk |quote= Abstract with pictorial }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, it was taken as war booty and moved to Italy by the Fascist regime, which wanted to commemorate the occupation of Ethiopia and the birth of the ephemeral "new Roman Empire" (see [[Italian Empire]]). The stele was transported by truck along the tortuous route between Axum and the port of [[Massawa]], taking five trips over a period of two months. It arrived via ship in [[Naples]] (on a ship called ''[[Battle of Adowa|Adwa]]''), on March 27, 1937. It was then transported to Rome, where it was reassembled and erected on [[Porta Capena]] square in front of the Ministry for Italian Africa (later the headquarters of the [[United Nations]]'s [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]) and the [[Circus Maximus]]. It was officially unveiled on October 28, 1937 to commemorate the fifteenth anniversary of the [[March on Rome]].&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; The operation was coordinated by Ugo Monneret de Villard.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} 

A bronze statue of the [[Lion of Judah]], symbol of the Ethiopian monarchy, was taken along with the obelisk and displayed in front of [[Roma Termini railway station|Termini railway station]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Repatriation===
[[File:Aksum-107547.jpg|alt=Workers during Aksum Obelisk re-installation|thumb|Workers during Aksum Obelisk re-installation]]
In a 1947 UN agreement, Italy agreed to return the stele to Ethiopia,&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1402354.stm |title=No return for Ethiopian treasure |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-06-22 |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the other looted piece, the Lion of Judah. While the latter was returned in 1967 following the 1961 visit of emperor [[Haile Selassie]] to Italy, little action was taken to return the stele for more than 50 years, partly as a consequence of the considerable technical difficulties related to its transportation.

One source&lt;ref&gt;For example, prince Amedeo di Savoia&lt;/ref&gt; also suggests that emperor Haile Sellassie, after hearing of these technical difficulties (and of the enormous costs necessary to overcome them), decided to grant the stele to the city of Rome, as a gift for the "renewed friendship" between Italy and Ethiopia. This assertion, however, remains very controversial and was not recognized by successive authorities. Colonel [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] who overthrew the emperor in 1974, asked the Italian government to return the stele to Ethiopia. Another controversial arrangement, according to some sources, seems to be that Italy could keep the stele in exchange for the construction of a hospital in Addis Ababa (Saint Paul's Hospital) and for the cancellation of debts owed by Ethiopia. In any case, after the fall of the Mengistu regime, the new Ethiopian government asked for the return of the stele, finding a positive answer from the then president of the Italian republic [[Oscar Luigi Scalfaro]], in April 1997.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

The first steps in dismantling the structure were taken in November 2003, under the supervision of Giorgio Croci, Professor of Structural Problems of Monuments and Historical Buildings at [[Sapienza University of Rome]].&lt;ref name="spectator-2003"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Johnson | first=Paul | authorlink=Paul Johnson (writer) | title=Trundling Musso’s stolen obelisk back to its African home | url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2005/03/trundling-mussos-stolen-obelisk-back-to-its-african-home/ | newspaper=The Spectator | date=12 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent was to ship the stele back to Ethiopia in March 2004, but the repatriation project encountered a series of obstacles: The runway at [[Axum Airport]] was considered too short for a cargo plane carrying even one of the thirds into which the stele had been cut; the roads and bridges between Addis Ababa and Axum were thought to be not up to the task of road transport; and access through the nearby [[Eritrea]]n port of Massawa&amp;nbsp;— which was how the stele originally left Africa&amp;nbsp;— was impossible due to the [[Foreign relations of Ethiopia#Eritrea|strained state of relations between Eritrea and Ethiopia]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Another reason for the delay in returning the stele from Italy to Ethiopia in 2004 was because of Italy's claim of not having the money to pay for the transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethiopic.com/heritage/obelisk_email.htm |title=E |publisher=Ethiopic.com |date=2005-04-29 |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt to get help from the United States was unsuccessful, as Americans stated that their planes were tied up in the war in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethiopic.com/hertage/ambassador.htm |title=An Open Letter to the US Ambassador in Addis |publisher=Ethiopic.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous attempts by Professor [[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]], who spearheaded the campaign to return the stele, remained unsuccessful until an American-Ethiopian, Dr. Aberra Molla, threatened the Italian government with the option of raising the money on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ethiopic.com/heritage/aksum.htm|title = Axsum Obelisk|publisher = Aberra Molla|date = 2004-03-07|accessdate = 2013-07-07|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150725213113/http://www.ethiopic.com/heritage/aksum.htm|archivedate = 2015-07-25|dead-url = yes|type = Email}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation cost Italy $7.7 million.&lt;ref name="return" /&gt; The stele remained in storage while Ethiopia decided how to reconstruct it without disturbing other ancient treasures still in the area (especially King Ezana's Stele). By March 2007 the foundation had been poured for the re-erection of the stele near King Ezana's Stele, structurally consolidated in this occasion. Reassembly began in June 2008, with a team chosen by [[UNESCO]] and led by Giorgio Croci, and the monument was re-erected in its original home and unveiled on 4 September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7597589.stm |title=Ethiopia unveils ancient obelisk |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-09-04 |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it was reassembled in Rome in 1937 three [[steel]] bars were inserted per section. When the obelisk was hit by [[lightning]] during a violent [[thunderstorm]] over Rome on 27 May 2002 this caused "considerable" damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2012770.stm |title=Rome obelisk struck by lightning |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-05-28 |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the new reconstruction the three sections are fixed together&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/cronache/08_maggio_26/l_obelisco_conteso_rinasce_ad_axum_6f8d4c02-2aec-11dd-9793-00144f02aabc.shtml |title='&amp;#39;Corriere della sera (in Italian)'&amp;#39;;L’obelisco conteso rinasce ad Axum |publisher=Corriere.it |date= |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a total of eight [[aramid]] fiber ([[Kevlar]]) bars: four between the first and second and four between the second and third sections. This arrangement guarantees structural resistance during earthquakes and avoids the use of steel, so as not to again make the stele a magnet for lightning and to avoid [[rust]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Several other similar stelae/obelisks exist in Ethiopia and Eritrea, such as the [[Hawulti (monument)|Hawulti]] in [[Metera]]. Like the Obelisk of Axum, the other stelae have a [[rectangular]] base with a false door carved on one side.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

A '''phreatophyte''' is a deep-[[root]]ed [[plant]] that obtains a significant portion of the water that it needs from the [[phreatic zone]] (zone of saturation) or the [[capillary fringe]] above the phreatic zone. 
Phreatophytes are plants that are supplied with surface water and often have their roots constantly in touch with moisture. A phreatophyte is one that absorbs its water from a constant source on the ground. They can usually be found along streams where there is a steady flow of surface or groundwater in areas where the water table is near the surface.

Phreatophytes live in areas with standing or running water, in arid areas and along the riverbeds and areas, apparently dry, where the [[water table]] is very shallow and near the surface. These plants have very deep roots that are able to reach the water table. Phreatophytes are not only characteristic of arid or desert zones, but also of wetlands, [[flood plain|floodplain]]s, depressions that hold water and [[estuarie]]s. In the wetlands, ecological classification does not provide a special classification, since in this case, most of the plants in the regions of high rainfall can deepen their roots to the top of the capillary fringe immediately above the water table, and function well as a phreatophyte. In this case they receive the label of [[mesophytic]]. Phreatophytic artificial extensions, manmade, are used as a method to purify [[greywater]].

==Biological value==

They are plants of great ecological value, fast growing pioneers and highly resistant to disease. They make excellent fodder for livestock and provide nesting areas and shelter for fauna. They are used as fuel, cheap construction material, and basketry. Many of the plants grow in degraded waters, salty or saline, that are useless for agriculture. Phreatophyte plants help to purify these waters and their roots fix heavy metals with a bacterial filter. For example, it is estimated that the total annual groundwater phreatophytes consumed in the western U.S. alone is about 30,000 [[cubic hectometre|hm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Phreatophytes are indicators of potable groundwater. Phreatophytes can be differentiated into plant communities by the length of their root, as they extend more or less deeply into the aquifer. Meinzer Studies. O.E. (1927) and Robinson, T.W. (1958) on vascular plants in the arid western U.S., set up certain general types of indicator species, according to level of minimum depth of the water table at which water was at the maximum suction [[Reverse osmosis|RO]].

Some phreatophytes have a low tolerance for [[salt]], indicating freshwater. This can be a valuable guide to the location of drinking and agricultural water in arid and semiarid areas. Examples of phreatophytes include welwitschia and mesquite: [[Prosopis glandulosa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=T.S. |last=David |author2=M.O. Henriques |author3=C. Kurz-Besson |author4=J.

Trees like the [[Fraxinus|Ash]], the [[Alder]], the [[Willow]] and the [[Populus|Poplar]] are also useful in this regard. These trees generally grow in [[freshwater]] [[aquifer]]s where the water table depth is not more than ten meters.

These species are found in [[Riparian zone|riparian ecosystems]] and areas characterized by shallow [[groundwater]], such as [[bottomlands]]. They are also present in [[water limited environment]]s; for example, [[Oak]]s in the [[Mediterranean climate]] regions.

The '''Price-Pottenger Nutrition Foundation (PPNF)''' is a U.S.&amp;nbsp;[[501(c)(3)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] established "to teach the public and professionals about foods, lifestyle habits, healing modalities, and environmental practices that can help people attain vibrant health."&lt;ref&gt;https://price-pottenger.org/about/ppnfs-mission&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1952, it was first known as the '''Santa Barbara Medical Research Foundation''' and later renamed the '''Weston A. Price Memorial Foundation''', in 1965, after the 20th century researcher [[Weston Price]] who emphasized the importance of nutrition for health and dentistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://price-pottenger.org/about-us|title=About Us|date=2015-10-13|work=Price Pottenger|access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other half of the foundation's current namesake is [[Francis M. Pottenger, Jr.]] whose [[Francis M. Pottenger, Jr.#Pottenger's cats|study of nutrition in cats]] sparked interest in a diet high in raw animal products including uncooked meats and unpasteurized dairy.  In 1969, after Price's death, the organization became the ''Price Pottenger Foundation'', and then the ''Price Pottenger Nutrition Foundation'', which it bears today.

PPNF primarily advocates: 1) that consumption of animal fats is not dangerous to human health, and 2) that mainstream agricultural methods which emphasize the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides as well as factory farming and significant processing of whole foods, reduces overall nutritional quality of food and human health.  The first set of claims go against the mainstream scientific consensus among researchers, doctors, and nutritionists, that a diet high in saturated fat presents serious risks to cardiovascular health and longevity.  The second set of claims is aligned with the increasingly popular [[organic food]] movement, although major food growers and producers consistently affirm the taste and nutritional quality of their food as identical or better than organics.

PPNF now houses over 10,000 books and publications, including the works of Dr. Royal Lee, Dr. Melvin Page, Dr. Emanuel Cheraskin, Dr. William Albrecht, and others.  The foundation today owns and protects the original copyrighted material of Weston A. Price, DDS, and Francis M. Pottenger, Jr., MD. They continue to republish Price's ''Nutrition and Physical Degeneration'', and Pottenger's ''Pottenger's Cats – A Study in Nutrition''.

==Origin==

===Weston Price===
{{Main|Weston Price}}
Price was a [[dentist]] from [[Cleveland, Ohio]], whose 1939 book, ''Nutritional and Physical Degeneration'',&lt;ref name=N&amp;PD&gt;Weston A. Price, DDS, ''Nutrition and Physical Degeneration'', 8th ed. (2008), {{ISBN|0-916764-20-6}} &amp; {{ISBN|978-0-916764-20-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the fieldwork he did in the 1920s and 1930s &lt;!-- specific dates? --&gt; among various world cultures, with the original goal of recording and studying the [[oral hygiene|dental health]] and development of pre-industrial populations including tribal Africans and Pacific islanders, Inuit, North and South American natives, and Australian aborigines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_DshCwAAQBAJ|title=100 Million Years of Food: What Our Ancestors Ate and Why It Matters Today|last=Le|first=Stephen|date=2016-02-02|publisher=Macmillan|year=|isbn=9781250050410|location=|pages=181|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book contains numerous photographs of the people he studied, and includes comparison photographs of the teeth and facial structure of people who lived on their traditional diet and people who had adopted or grown up on industrialized food. In certain instances it was possible for Price to examine and photograph traditional and industrialized eaters from the same family.&lt;ref name="N&amp;PD" /&gt;

===Francis M. Pottenger, Jr.===
{{Main|Francis M. Pottenger, Jr.}}
Pottenger was a doctor whose 1932-1942 ''Pottenger Cat Study'' addressed the nutritive value of heat-labile elements — nutrients destroyed by heat and available only in raw foods. Pottenger used donated laboratory cats to test the potency of the adrenal extract [[hormone]]s he was making. The adrenal glands of these cats were removed for the experiments and Pottenger noted that most of the cats died during or following the operation.  He was feeding the cats a supposedly nutritive diet consisting of raw milk, cod liver oil and cooked meat scraps of liver, tripe, sweetbread, brains, heart and muscle. When the number of donated cats exceeded the supply of food available, Pottenger began ordering raw meat scraps from a local meat packing plant, including organs, meat, and bone; and fed a separate group of cats from this supply.  Within months this separate group appeared in better health than the cooked meat group. Pottenger conducted subsequent studies involving approximately 900 cats over a period of ten years, with three generations of cats studied.  His experiments showed that cats were healthiest after being fed raw meat and raw dairy.

==Key individuals==

===Joseph and Pat Connolly===
Marion Patricia ("Pat") Connolly was the curator for PPNF, overseeing the archiving and promotion of the organization's materials.  Pat studied health and nutrition for over 66 years and lectured on a variety of nutritional subjects.  According to the PPNF, she was the foremost authority on the work of Price and Pottenger.  In 1962 Pat took a course on nutrition by Alfreda Rooke, then Curator of PPNF, who had studied under Price.  In 1972, she became a PPNF Nutrition Instructor and began teaching Rooke's course.   Pat Connolly taught classes educating people on Price's research and its applications.   She authored several books, including ''Dietotherapy (The Kelley Research Foundation)'', ''Mini Guide To Living Foods'', ''The Guide to Living Foods (PPNF)'', ''Food Alive (Livingston-Wheeler Medical Clinic)'', ''A Modern Approach to the Primitive Diet (Nero)'', and ''The Candida-Albicans Yeast-Free Cookbook (McGraw Hill)''.  She was also listed as a co-author of the first edition of [[Nourishing Traditions]].  She died in November 2010. 
&lt;ref name="ppnf.org2"&gt;http://ppnf.org/about/living-memorial/marion-patricia-connolly&lt;/ref&gt;

Her husband Joseph Connolly practiced dentistry in San Diego for 40 years and helped found PPNF.   He died in 1996.

===George Meinig===
In 1994 George E. Meinig published ''Root Canal Cover-up Exposed'' which resurrected Price's old studies.&lt;ref name=Baumgartner2&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Baumgartner JC, Bakland LK, Sugita EI | year = 2002 | title = Endodontics, Chapter 3: Microbiology of endodontics and asepsis in endodontic practice | url = http://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/Dr.Hanan/BooksIngle/ch03.pdf |format=PDF| publisher  = Hamilton, Ontario: BC Becker | pages = 63–94 | accessdate = 2009-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding the book, Hasselgren in New York Academy of Dentistry's ''Annals of dentistry'' stated "[t]he focal infection theory, supported by many including Dr. Price, has been attacked, debated, accepted, criticized, agreed upon, etc. but it has not been covered up." Hasselgren noted that Meinig would sometime confuse the meanings of "infection" and "inflammation" and based all his work on Price's 1923 ''Dental Infections, Oral and Systemic'' book.&lt;ref name="Hasselgren, Gunnar 1994 pg 42"&gt;Hasselgren, Gunnar (1994) Annals of dentistry: Volumes 53-54 ''New York Academy of Dentistry'' pg 42)&lt;/ref&gt;  Hasselgren observed: "Many clinicians appear today to have lost sight of the fact that endodontical treatment shall be based on biology and not on the use of various gadgets to sweep canals. Also, one-visit treatment of necrotic, infected teeth is being advocated and practiced even if no long-term study has been performed to investigate this kind of treatment.  The work of Dr. Weston Price is therefore still to a great extent valid and important and the role of infection can not be underestimated."&lt;ref name="Hasselgren, Gunnar 1994 pg 42"/&gt; Meinig died in May 2008 at the age of 93.

==Publications and education==
The PPNF houses an archive of books related to Price and Pottenger's work as well as the works of authors in related fields.  The foundation publishes its own journal, the ''Journal of Health and Healing''.&lt;ref name=ppnf.org3&gt;http://ppnf.org/resources/journal-article-archives&lt;/ref&gt; They also sell a variety of books, DVD, and CDs, publish an online newsletter, and offer classes.

'''[[Probiotic]]s''' are defined to be non-pathogenic strains of organism that are incorporated into the diet to modify [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gut]] microbial ecology, leading to beneficial structural and functional changes in the gut. Some probiotics may serve as a barrier for the colonization of [[pathogen]]s to prevent disease and enhance the [[immune system]]. In addition, some may carry out [[Metabolism|metabolic]] functions such as helping the fermentation of nondigestible fibres, and storing energy in the form of short-chain [[fatty acid]]s. Of all the types of gut microbiota, ''[[Bifidobacteria]]'' and ''[[Lactobacilli]]'' are considered the two most essential bacteria beneficial to human health while ''[[Staphylococci]]'' and ''[[Clostridia]]'' are considered pathogenic to human health.{{medical citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Health effects==

===Diarrhea===
As many prevention methods for diarrhea have adverse effects (e.g. intestinal [[intussusception (blood vessel growth)|intussusception]] in the usage of [[rotavirus]] vaccine), scientists are now turning to probiotics in hope of using it as a supplement to treat acute diarrhea.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huang | first1 = J. S. | last2 = Bousvaros | first2 = A. | last3 = Lee | first3 =  | year = 2002 | title = Efficacy of Probiotic Use in Acute Diarrhea in Children: A Meta-analysis | url = | journal = Digestive Diseases and Sciences | volume = 47 | issue = 11| pages = 2625–2634| doi = 10.1023/A:1020501202369}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review that covered 34 masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trials related to diarrhea and probiotics, it was concluded that there was an overall reduction of 52% in antibiotic associated diarrhea, an 8% reduction in traveller’s diarrhea, and a 34% reduction in other types of acute diarrhea. These numbers reflect a protective effect against diarrhea in subjects including both adults and children. In terms of children (age &lt; 18 years), seven out of the 12 trials conducted in a health care setting showed a reduction in acute diarrhea of 57%. There was no significant difference in the protective effect of strains, namely ''[[Saccharomyces boulardii]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus rhamnosus]] GG'', ''[[Lactobacillus acidophilus]]'', and ''[[Lactobacillus bulgaricus]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sazawal|first1=S.|last2=Hiremath|first2=G.|last3=Dhingra|first3=U.|last4=Malik|first4=P.|last5=Deb|first5=S.|last6=Black|first6=R.

Probiotics were found to be effective in treating acute, infectious diarrhea in children when a review was completed in 2001, involving &gt; 700 children aged from one to 48 months with acute diarrhea.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Szajewska | first1 = H. | last2 = Mrukowicz | first2 = J. | year = 2001 | title = Probiotics in the Treatment and Prevention of Acute Infectious Diarrhea in Infants and Children: A Systematic Review of Published Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials | url = | journal = Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition | volume = 33 | issue = 2| pages = S17–S25 | doi=10.1097/00005176-200110002-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2002 review showed that ''Lactobacillus'' reduced the average duration of acute diarrhea by 0.7 days and stool frequency by 1.6 on the second day of treatment. Dosage was most effective at more than ten billion [[colony-forming unit]]s of ''Lactobacillus'' during the first 48 hours of diarrhea.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Niel | first1 = C.

====Antibiotic-associated diarrhea====
[[File:Pseudomembranous colitis.JPG|thumb|Pseudomembranous colitis.]]

This illness can generally be accounted for by ''Clostridium difficile'', a bacterium that can sometimes cause severe diarrhea known as [[pseudomembranous colitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bartlett | first1 = J. G. | last2 = Chang | first2 = T. W. | last3 = Gurwith | first3 = M. | last4 = Gorbach | first4 = S. | last5 = Onderdonk | first5 = A. B. | year = 1987 | title = Antibiotic-associated Pseudomembranous Colitis due to Toxin-producing Clostridia | doi = 10.1056/nejm197803092981003| journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 298 | issue = 10| pages = 531–534 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of six trials related to antibiotic-associated diarrhea in 766 children aged one month to six years, there was an overall reduction in [[Antibiotic-associated diarrhea|AAD]] when children were fed probiotics. The reduction, when compared to placebo, was seen to be from 28.5% to 11.9%; in fact, when patients were fed probiotics along with their dose of antibiotics, one fewer patient would develop AAD out of every seven. Antibiotics fed to the children in the trials included [[amoxicillin]], [[penicillin]] and [[erythromycin]]. Evidence suggests that ''S. boulardii'' is best at preventing AAD in children, ''Lactobacillus GG'' ranking second, and a mixture of ''S. thermophilus'' and ''B. lactis'' relatively ranking last. No conclusion can be made on how probiotics can reduce the risk of AAD from any specific types of antibiotic.&lt;ref name=ReferenceC/&gt;

One of the proposed mechanisms of how probiotics protect from AAD is by regulating the composition of organisms in the intestines. Studies involving ''L. acidophilus'' and ''Bifidobacterium'' suggest that these microbes inhibit the growth of facultative [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic bacteria]], which tends to increase during antibiotic treatment. As a result, it is seen that probiotics can alter and prevent changes in the intestinal [[microflora]] caused by antibiotics.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yan|first1=F|last2=Polk|first2=D. B.|year=2006|title=Probiotics as Functional Food in the Treatment of Diarrhea|url=|journal=Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care|volume=9|issue=6|pages=717–721|doi=10.1097/01.mco.0000247477.02650.51|pmid=17053425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Viral diarrhea ====
[[File:Rotavirus !.jpg|thumb|a three dimensional model of [[Rotavirus]].]]

Viral diarrhea refers to the type of diarrhea that is caused by a [[rotavirus]], a virus often impacting toddlers and infants. A meta-analysis of nine previously conducted studies (those studies were conducted in Canada, Thailand, and Finland) has shown that certain types of probiotics are also effective in treating viral diarrhea in hospital-admitted children. Subjects of those studies ranged from one to above 36 months old. The study results showed that ''the duration of the illness was shortened by 0.7 days on average'' when placing the children on [[Lactobacillus]] therapy. 

Although it is still largely unknown as to how probiotics do this, two mechanisms have been currently proposed. The first mechanism suggests that ''Lactobacilli'' augment the development of intestinal [[mucins]] (glyosylated proteins), which consequently protect the body from intestinal infections.{{medical citation needed|date=August 2017}}

====Persistent diarrhea====
A 2013 review suggested probiotics are effective in treating persistent diarrhea in children, though more research is needed. Persistent diarrhea is an episode that starts acutely but then lasts for 14 days or more; In [[Developing country|developing countries]] it is an important cause of [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]] and mortality in children under five years old. The study showed average duration reduced by four days and shorter hospital stay; stool frequency was reduced on the fifth day.&lt;ref name="Cochrane 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernaola Aponte|first=G|author2=Bada Mancilla C |author3=Carreazo N |author4= Rojas Galarza R |title=Probiotics for persistent diarrhoea in children|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=August 2013|issue=8|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007401.pub3#sthash.DwpPRows.dpuf|url=http://summaries.cochrane.org/CD007401/probiotics-for-persistent-diarrhoea-in-children|accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allergy===
Probiotics are commonly given to breast-feeding mothers and their young children to prevent eczema, but  some doubt exists over the strength of evidence supporting this practice.&lt;ref name=eczema&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cuello-Garcia CA, Brożek JL, Fiocchi A, Pawankar R, Yepes-Nuñez JJ, Terracciano L, Gandhi S, Agarwal A, Zhang Y, Schünemann HJ |title=Probiotics for the prevention of allergy: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials |journal=J.

{{Business administration}}
'''Procurement''' is the process of finding, agreeing terms, and acquiring goods, services, or works from an external source, often via a tendering or competitive [[bidding]] process. The process is used to ensure the buyer receives goods, services, or works at the best possible price, when aspects such as quality, quantity, time, and location are compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weele|first=Arjan J. van|title=Purchasing and Supply Chain Management: Analysis, Strategy, Planning and Practice|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Andover|isbn=978-1-4080-1896-5|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations and public bodies often define processes intended to promote fair and open competition for their business while minimizing risk, such as exposure to fraud and collusion.

Almost all purchasing decisions include factors such as delivery and handling, marginal benefit, and price fluctuations. Procurement generally involves making buying decisions under conditions of scarcity. If good data is available, it is good practice to make use of economic analysis methods such as cost-benefit analysis or cost-utility analysis.

==Overview==
An important distinction should be made between analyses without risk and those with risk. Where risk is involved, either in the costs or the benefits, the concept of best value should be employed.

Procurement activities are also often split into two distinct categories, direct and indirect spend. Direct spend refers to the production-related procurement that encompasses all items that are part of finished products, such as raw material, components and parts. Direct procurement, which is the focus in [[supply chain management]], directly affects the production process of manufacturing firms. In contrast, [[indirect procurement]] concerns non-production-related acquisition: obtaining “operating resources” which a company purchases to enable its operations. Indirect procurement comprises a wide variety of goods and services, from standardized items like office supplies and machine [[lubricants]] to complex and costly products and services like heavy equipment, consulting services, and [[outsourcing]] services.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, M.A. and Roehrich, J.K. (2009), Contracts, relationships and integration: Towards a model of the procurement of complex performance. ''International Journal of Procurement Management'', 2(2):125–142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, N.D. Roehrich, J.K. and Davies, A.C. (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics==

=== Procurement vs. sourcing vs. acquisition ===
Procurement is one component of the broader concept of sourcing and acquisition. Typically procurement is viewed as more tactical in nature (the process of physically buying a product or service) and sourcing and acquisition are viewed as more strategic and encompassing.

The [[Institute of Supply Management]] (ISM) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/content.cfm?ItemNumber=5558|title=ISM - Supply Management Defined|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=26 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213182841/https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/content.cfm?ItemNumber=5558|archivedate=13 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines strategic sourcing as the process of identifying sources that could provide needed products or services for the acquiring organization. The term procurement used to reflect the entire purchasing process or cycle, and not just the tactical components. ISM defines procurement as an organizational function that includes specifications development, value analysis, supplier market research, negotiation, buying activities, contract administration, inventory control, traffic, receiving and stores. Purchasing refers to the major function of an organization that is responsible for acquisition of required materials, services and equipment.

The United States [[Defense Acquisition University]] (DAU) defines procurement as the act of buying goods and services for the government.&lt;ref name="DAUP 09"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://akss.dau.mil/dag/DoD5000.asp?view=document|title=Glossary of Defense Acquisition Acronyms and Terms, 12th Edition (plus updates since publication), accessed on 22 April 2009, Defense Acquisition University|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=26 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404030824/http://akss.dau.mil/dag/DoD5000.asp?view=document|archivedate=4 April 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
DAU defines acquisition as the conceptualization, initiation, design, development, test, contracting, production, deployment, Logistics Support (LS), modification, and disposal of weapons and other systems, supplies, or services (including construction) to satisfy [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] needs, intended for use in or in support of military missions.&lt;ref name = "DAUP 09"/&gt;

Acquisition and sourcing are therefore much wider concepts than procurement.

Multiple sourcing business models exist, and acquisition models exist.

===Acquisition process===
The revised acquisition process for major systems in industry and defense is shown in the next figure. The process is defined by a series of phases during which technology is defined and matured into viable concepts, which are subsequently developed and readied for production, after which the systems produced are supported in the field.&lt;ref name="DAUP 01"&gt;[http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf ''Systems Engineering Fundamentals.''] Defense Acquisition University Press, 2001 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203501/http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Acquisition Process.jpg|center|thumb|560px|Model of the acquisition process&lt;ref name = "DAUP 01"/&gt;]]
The process allows for a given system to enter the process at any of the development phases. For example, a system using unproven technology would enter at the beginning stages of the process and would proceed through a lengthy period of technology maturation, while a system based on mature and proven technologies might enter directly into engineering development or, conceivably, even production. The process itself includes four phases of development:&lt;ref name = "DAUP 01"/&gt;
* Concept and technology development is intended to explore alternative concepts based on assessments of operational needs, technology readiness, risk, and affordability.
* The concept and technology development phase begins with concept exploration. During this stage, concept studies are undertaken to define alternative concepts and to provide information about capability and risk that would permit an objective comparison of competing concepts.
* The system development and demonstration phase could be entered directly as a result of a technological opportunity and urgent user need, as well as having come through concept and technology development.
* The last, and longest phase is the sustainable and disposal phase of the program. During this phase all necessary activities are accomplished to maintain and sustain the system in the field in the most cost-effective manner possible.

===Sourcing business models===
Procurement officials increasingly realize that their make-buy supplier decisions fall along a continuum from simple buying transactions to more complex, strategic buyer-supplier collaborations. It is important for procurement officials to use the right sourcing business model that fits each buyer-seller situation. There are seven models along the sourcing continuum: basic provider, approved provider, preferred provider, performance-based/managed services model, [[Vested]] business model, [[shared services]] model and equity partnerships.
* A basic provider model is transaction-based; it usually has a set price for individual products and services for which there are a wide range of standard market options. Typically these products or services are readily available, with little differentiation in what is offered.
* An approved provider model uses a transaction-based approach where goods and services are purchased from prequalified suppliers that meet certain performance or other selection criteria. 
* The preferred provider model also uses a transaction-based economic model, but a key difference between the preferred provider and the other transaction-based models is that the buyer has chosen to move to a supplier relationship where there is an opportunity for the supplier to add incremental value to the buyer’s business to meet strategic objectives.
* A performance-based (or managed services model) is generally a formal, longer-term supplier agreement that combines a relational contracting model with an output-based economic model. It seeks to drive supplier accountability for output-based service-level agreements (SLAs) and/or cost reduction targets.
* A vested sourcing business model is a hybrid relationship that combines an outcome-based economic model with a relational contracting model. Companies enter into highly collaborative arrangements designed to create and share value for buyers and suppliers above and beyond.
* A shared services model is typically an internal organization based on an arm’s-length outsourcing arrangement. Using this approach, processes are often centralized into an SSO that charges business units or users for the services they use. 
* An equity partnership creates a legally binding entity; it can take different legal forms, from buying a supplier (an acquisition), to creating a subsidiary, to equity-sharing joint ventures or entering into cooperative (co-op) arrangements.

===Procurement software===
Procurement software (often labeled as [[e-procurement]] software) manages the purchasing processes electronically or via [[cloud computing]].

===Procurement life cycle===
{{Original research|section|date=October 2016}}Most of the organizations think of their procurement process in terms of a life cycle.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Different consulting firms and experts have developed various frameworks. Some of the most common steps from the most popular frameworks include:
* '''Identification of need and requirements analysis''' is an internal step that involves an understanding of business objectives by establishing a short term strategy (three to five years) for overall spend category followed by defining the technical direction and requirements.
* '''External macro-level market analysis''': Once an organization understands its requirements, it should look outward to assess the overall marketplace. A key part of a market analysis is understanding the overall competitiveness of the marketplace and trends that are likely to impact the organization.
*'''Cost analysis''' is the accumulation, examination and manipulation of cost data for comparisons and projections. A cost analysis is important to help an organization make a make-buy decision.
* '''Supplier identification''' includes identifying particular suppliers that can provide the required product or services. There are many sources to search for potential suppliers. One good source is trade shows. Modern procurement software often incorporates a supplier catalog for standardized goods and services.
* '''[[Non-disclosure agreement]] (NDA)''': It is quite normal to request vendors to sign an NDA prior to engaging with them. This protects the organisation where sensitive information is shared with multiple potential vendors ahead of releasing detailed requirements which often point to strategic decisions a firm has taken.
* '''Supplier communication:''' When one or more suitable suppliers have been identified, an organization will typically conduct a competitive [[bidding]] process. Organizations can use a variety of competitive bidding methods including [[requests for quotation]], [[Request for proposal|requests for proposals]], [[Request for information|requests for information]], [[Request for tender|requests for tender]], [[Request for Solution|request for solution]] or a request for partnership. Some institutions choose to use a [[notification service]] in order to raise the competition for the chosen opportunity. These systems can either be direct from their e-tendering software, or as a re-packaged notification from an external system. During this step direct contact may be made with the suppliers. References for product/service quality are consulted, and any requirements for follow-up services including installation, maintenance, and [[warranty]] are investigated. Samples of the product/service being considered may be examined, or trials undertaken. Organizations should do a risk assessment, [[total cost of ownership]] analysis and [[best value]] assessment before selecting the final suppliers/solution.
* '''Negotiations and contracting:''' [[Negotiation]]s are undertaken that often include price, availability, customization, and delivery schedules. The details are outlined in a [[purchase order]] or more formal [[contract]].
*'''Logistics and performance management:''' Supplier preparation, [[expediting]], shipment, delivery, and payment for the product/service are completed, based on contract terms. Installation and training may also be included. An organization should evaluate the performance of the product/service as they are consumed. A supplier scorecard is a popular tool for this purpose. When the product/service has been consumed or disposed of, the contract expires, or the product or service is to be re-ordered, the organization should review their experience with the product/service. If the product/service is to be re-ordered, the company determines whether to consider other suppliers or to continue with the same supplier.
* '''Supplier management and liaison:''' Organizations that have more strategic goods or services that require ongoing interfaces with a supplier will use a [[supplier relationship management]] process. Strategic [[outsourcing]] relationships should set up formal governance processes.

===Procurement performance===
The [[Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply|Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply]] (CIPS) promotes a model of "five rights" which it claims are "a traditional formula expressing the basic objectives of procurement and the general criteria by which procurement performance is measured", namely that goods and services purchased should be of the right '''quality''', in the right '''quantity''', delivered to the right '''place''' at the right '''time''' and obtained at the right '''price'''.&lt;ref&gt;CIPS in partnership with Profex Publishing, ''Procurement and Supply Operations'', 2012, revised 2016, pp. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; CIPS also offers an alternative listing of the five rights as "buy[ing] goods or services of the right quality, in the right quantity, from the right source, at the right time and at the right price.&lt;ref&gt;CIPS, [https://cips.org/knowledge/procurement-glossary/f/ Procurement Glossary - F] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414081801/https://cips.org/knowledge/procurement-glossary/f/ |date=14 April 2017 }}, accessed 14 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Ardent Partners published a report in 2011 which presented a comprehensive, industry-wide view into what was happening in the world of procurement at that time by drawing on the experience, performance, and perspective of nearly 250 chief procurement officers and other procurement executives. The report includes the main procurement performance and operational benchmarks that procurement leaders use to gauge the success of their organizations. This report found that the average procurement department manages 60.6% of total enterprise spend. This measure commonly called "spend under management" refers to the percentage of total enterprise spend (which includes all direct and indirect spend) that a procurement organization manages or influences. The average procurement department also achieved an annual savings of 6.7% in the last reporting cycle, sourced 52.6% of its addressable spend, and has a contract compliance rate of 62.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=| url=http://ardentpartners.com/research/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=4_12&amp;products_id=7| title=Ardent Partners Research - CPO 2011: Innovative Ideas for the Decade Ahead| access-date=| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924045811/http://ardentpartners.com/research/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=4_12&amp;products_id=7| archivedate=24 September 2011| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship with Finance ===
Procurement and Finance have, as functions within the corporate structure, been at loggerheads. The contentious nature of their relationship can perhaps be attributed to the history of procurement itself. Historically, Procurement has been considered Finance’s underling. One reason behind this perception can be ascribed to semantics. When Procurement was in its infancy, it was referred to as a “commercial” operation. And so the procurement department was referred to as the ''commercial'' department rather than the procurement department: the word “commercial” was understood to be associated with money. And so it was obvious that Procurement would become directly answerable to Finance. Another factor, equally grounded in semantics, was that procurement departments (or rather, commercial departments) were always seen as “spending the money.” This impression was enough to situate Procurement within the Finance function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.procurify.com/2017/02/22/procurement-freed-finances-control/|title=Here’s What Happened To This Company After Procurement Was Freed From Finance’s Control|date=2017-02-22|website=Procurement Sense|access-date=2017-03-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224024031/http://blog.procurify.com/2017/02/22/procurement-freed-finances-control/|archivedate=24 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It's easy to see why Procurement and Finance are functions with interests that are mutually irreconcilable. Whereas Procurement is fundamentally concerned with the spending or disbursal of money, Finance, by its very nature, performs a cost-cutting role. That is fundamentally the reason why Procurement's aspirations have been constantly checked by Finance's cost-cutting imperatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.procurify.com/2017/01/25/cpo-stand-up-to-your-cfo/|title=Calling All CPOs: Here’s How You Can Stand Up To Your CFO|date=2017-01-25|website=Procurement Sense|access-date=2017-03-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211042430/http://blog.procurify.com/2017/01/25/cpo-stand-up-to-your-cfo/|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion, however, has been changing as more chief procurement officers have begun to argue for more autonomy and less interference from Finance departments.

==Public procurement==
{{main article|Government procurement}}
Public procurement generally is an important sector of the economy. In Europe, public procurement accounts for 16.3% of the Community [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|date=|url=http://europa.eu/youreurope/business/profiting-from-eu-market/benefiting-from-public-contracts/index_en.htm|title=Public contracts - Your Europe - Business|publisher=Europa.eu|access-date=16 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628072231/http://europa.eu/youreurope/business/profiting-from-eu-market/benefiting-from-public-contracts/index_en.htm|archivedate=28 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green public procurement===
In green public procurement (GPP), contracting authorities and [[entities]] take environmental issues into account when tendering for goods or services. The goal is to reduce the impact of the procurement on human health and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/gpp/glossary_en.htm |title=EC.Europa.eu |publisher=EC.Europa.eu |date= |access-date=16 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425190556/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/gpp/glossary_en.htm |archivedate=25 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European Union, the Commission has adopted its communication on public procurement for a better environment, where proposes a political target of 50% Green public procurement to be reached by the Member States by the year 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/gpp/index_en.htm |title=EC.europa.eu |publisher=EC.europa.eu |date= |access-date=16 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110928041946/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/gpp/index_en.htm |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accessible procurement ===
The United States Section 508 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.section508.gov/|title=Section508.gov - GSA Government-wide Section 508 Accessibility Program|author=|date=|website=www.section508.gov|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323122051/https://www.section508.gov/|archivedate=23 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and European Commission standard EN 301 549 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mandate376.standards.eu/standard|title=Standard - EN 301 549  - Mandate 376|author=|date=|website=mandate376.standards.eu|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616234249/http://mandate376.standards.eu/standard|archivedate=16 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; require public procurement to promote accessibility. This means buying products and technology that has accessibility features built in to promote access for the around 1 billion people worldwide who have disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/en/|title=World report on disability|author=|date=|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316124425/http://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/en/|archivedate=16 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative competitive bidding procedures ==
{{Original research|section|date=October 2016}}There are several alternatives to traditional competitive bid tendering that are available in formal procurement. One approach that has gained increasing momentum in the construction industry and among developing economies is the [[selection in planning]] (SIP) process, which enables project developers and equipment purchasers to make significant changes to their requirements with relative ease. The SIP process also enables vendors and contractors to respond with greater accuracy and competitiveness as a result of the generally longer lead times they are afforded. University of Tennessee research&lt;ref name="Tennessee"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vitasek|first1=Kate|last2=Kling|first2=Jeanne|last3=Keith|first3=Bonnie|last4=Handley|first4=David|title=Unpacking Collaborative Bidding|date=2016|publisher=HASLAM COLLEGE OF BUSINESS|location=Tennessee, USA|page=9|url=http://www.lindahl.se/media/1123954/unpacking_collaborative_bidding_march_6_3_.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428053108/http://www.lindahl.se/media/1123954/unpacking_collaborative_bidding_march_6_3_.pdf|archivedate=28 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that [[Request for Solution]] and [[Request for association]] (also known as request for partner or request for partnership) methods are also gaining traction as viable alternatives and more collaborative methods for selecting strategic suppliers – especially for [[outsourcing]].

==Fraud==
Recognizing the negative impact of procurement fraud, OECD has published guidelines on how to detect and combat bid rigging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://procurement.tv/2016/07/06/detecting-bid-rigging-in-public-procurement-oecd-guidelines/|title=Detecting Bid Rigging in Public Procurement – OECD Guidelines|first=|last=networkthoughts|date=6 July 2016|publisher=|access-date=26 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012181516/https://procurement.tv/2016/07/06/detecting-bid-rigging-in-public-procurement-oecd-guidelines/|archivedate=12 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Procurement fraud can be defined as dishonestly obtaining an advantage, avoiding an obligation or causing a loss to public property or various means during procurement process by public servants, contractors or any other person involved in the procurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://openlibrary.org/b/OL23998519M/Combating_Procurment_Frauds|title=Combating Procurement Frauds Author Dr Irfan Ahmad}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is a [[Kickback (bribery)|kickback]], whereby a dishonest agent of the supplier pays a dishonest agent of the purchaser to select the supplier's bid, often at an inflated price. Other frauds in procurement include:
* Collusion among bidders to reduce competition.
* Providing bidders with advance "inside" information.
* Submission of false or inflated invoices for services and products that are not delivered or work that is never done. "Shadow vendors", shell companies that are set up and used for billing, may be used in such schemes.
* Intentional substitution of substandard materials without the customer's agreement.
* Use of "sole source" contracts without proper justification.
* Use of prequalification standards in specifications to unnecessarily exclude otherwise qualified contractors.
* Dividing requirements to qualify for small-purchase procedures to avoid scrutiny for contract review procedures of larger purchases.

Two of these motors were used in the French electric locomotive [[:fr:Midi E 3301|Midi E3301]]]]
A '''repulsion motor''' is a type of [[electric motor]] for using on [[alternating current]] (AC).  It was formerly used as a [[traction motor]] for electric trains (e.g. [[SR Class CP]] and [[SR Class SL]] [[electric multiple unit]]s) but has been superseded by other types of motors. Repulsion motors are classified under [[Single-phase electric power|single phase]] motors. In repulsion motors the [[stator]] windings are connected directly to the AC [[Electric power system|power supply]] and the [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] is connected to a [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] and [[Brush (electric)|brush]] assembly, similar to that of a [[direct current]] (DC) motor.&lt;ref&gt;''The Electrical Year Book 1937,'' published by Emmott and Company Limited, Manchester, England, pp 79–82&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The motor has a [[stator]] and a [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] but there is no electrical connection between the two and the rotor current is generated by [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]].  The rotor winding is connected to a [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] which is in contact with a pair of [[Short circuit|short-circuited]] [[Brush (electric)|brushes]] which can be moved to change their angular position relative to an imaginary line drawn through the axis of the stator.  The motor can be started, stopped and reversed, and the speed can be varied, simply by changing the angular position of the brushes.

==Voltage==
Most commutator motors are limited to about 1,500 [[volt]]s because higher voltages give rise to a risk of [[electric arc|arcing]] across the commutator.  Repulsion motors can be used at higher voltages because the rotor circuit is not electrically connected to the supply.

Repulsion motors are based on the principle of repulsion between two [[magnetic field]]s. Consider a 2-pole [[salient pole]] motor with a vertical magnetic axis. The armature is connected to a commutator and brushes. The brushes are short circuited using a low-resistance jumper.
When alternating current is supplied to the field (stator) winding, it induces an [[electromotive force]] (emf) in the armature. The direction of alternating current is such that it creates a [[north pole]] at the top and a [[south pole]] at the bottom. The direction of induced emf is given by [[Lenz's law]], according to which the direction of induced emf opposes the cause producing it. The induced emf induces current in the armature conductors and the direction of the induced current depends on the position of the brushes.

===Stop positions===
;Brush axis parallel to field
If the brush axis is along the direction of the magnetic field, the armature behaves like an electromagnet and a N-pole is formed directly below the N-pole of the stator and a S-pole is formed directly above the S-pole of the stator. The net torque in this condition is zero. Both the N-poles repel each other and both the S-poles repel each other. The two repulsion forces are in direct opposition to each other and hence no torque will be developed. This is very fast process in this repulsion motor.

;Brush axis at right angles to field
If the brushes are shifted through 90 degrees, so that the magnetic axis is perpendicular to the brush axis, the coils undergoing short circuit change. Apart from the coils undergoing short circuit, the voltage induced in the other coils between the brush terminals is neutralized and the net voltage is zero. Since there is no induced emf, there is no current in the circuit and the net torque developed is, again, zero.

===Run positions===

If the brush axis is displaced at an angle to the magnetic axis, a net voltage is induced at the brush terminals which will produce current in the armature. The current in the armature circuit will produce its own magnetic field, with North and South poles, but in this condition, the North Pole is not directly under the North pole of the magnetic axis and the South Pole is not directly above the South Pole of the magnetic axis. The poles of the armature are slightly displaced from those of the stator. In this condition, the N-pole of the stator field will repel the N-pole of the rotor field and the S-pole of stator field will repel the S-pole of the rotor field, so the rotor starts rotating.

;Direction of rotation
The direction of rotation is determined by the position of the brushes with respect to the magnetic field of the stator. If the brushes are shifted clockwise from the main magnetic axis, the motor will rotate in a clockwise direction. If the brushes are shifted counter-clockwise from the main magnetic axis, the motor will rotate in a counter-clockwise direction.

;Torque and speed control
The starting torque of a repulsion motor is determined by the angle of brush shift from the main magnetic axis. The maximum torque is obtained from a brush shift of 45 degrees. Brush shift can also be used to control the speed of a repulsion motor.

==Types of repulsion motor==

Types of repulsion motor are listed below. It is likely that the different types were developed to match the [[torque]]/speed characteristics of the motor as closely as possible to the service it was required to provide.

===Elihu Thomson===

The [[Elihu Thomson]] motor is the original repulsion motor and is described in "Construction" above.

===Deri===
{| style="float:right"
|-
|[[File:Deri 1.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|Two pole Deri motor]]
|[[File:Deri 2.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|Four pole Deri motor]]
|}
The [[Miksa Déri|Deri]] motor is similar to the Elihu Thomson type but has two pairs of short-circuited brushes—one fixed and one moveable.  This allows very fine control of speed.

===Latour-Winter-Eichberg===

This is the "compensated" repulsion motor devised independently by '''Latour''' and by '''Winter-Eichberg'''. There are, again, two pairs of brushes but they are fixed at right angles to each other.  One pair is short-circuited while the other pair is fed with variable-voltage [[alternating current]] from [[Tap (transformer)|tappings]] on the secondary winding of a small [[transformer]].  The primary winding of the transformer is in [[Series and parallel circuits|series]] with the stator winding of the motor.  This motor has the same torque/speed characteristics as an ordinary series-wound motor.

===Atkinson===

The '''Atkinson''' motor has two stator coils at right angles to each other.  Speed control (by brush-shifting) is possible from 75% below [[Synchronization (alternating current)|synchronous]] speed to 10% above.  Starting torque is about 2.5 times full-load torque with twice full-load current.

===Repulsion-start induction-run===

These were used where high starting torque was required. They started as repulsion motors, but once they were running at a sizable fraction of full speed, the brushes were lifted mechanically and all commutator bars were short-circuited together to create the equivalent of a squirrel-cage [[induction motor]].

==Applications==
Repulsion motor applications included:
* High speed lifts
* Fans and pumps
* Printing presses 
* Textile machines
* Film winding machines (smooth manual speed and direction adjustment could be achieved without complicated circuitry)

* [[AC motor]]

'''Revegetation''' is the process of replanting and rebuilding the [[soil]] of disturbed land. This may be a natural process produced by [[plant]] colonization and [[Ecological succession|succession]], manmade [[Rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] projects, accelerated process designed to repair damage to a [[landscape]] due to [[wildfire]], [[mining]], [[flood]], or other cause. Originally the process was simply one of applying [[seed]] and [[fertilizer]] to disturbed lands, usually [[grass]]es or [[clover]]. The fibrous [[root]] network of grasses is useful for short-term erosion control, particularly on sloping ground. Establishing long-term plant communities requires forethought as to appropriate species for the climate, size of stock required, and impact of replanted vegetation on local fauna.&lt;ref&gt;Revegetating Riparian Areas in the Southwest “Lessons Learned” David R. Dreesen, Agronomist/Horticulturist Gregory A. Fenchel, Manager USDA–NRCS Los Lunas Plant Materials Center&lt;/ref&gt; The motivations behind revegetation are diverse, answering needs that are both technical and aesthetic, but it is usually [[erosion]] prevention that is the primary reason. Revegetation helps prevent [[soil erosion]], enhances the ability of the soil to absorb more water in significant rain events, and in conjunction reduces [[turbidity]] dramatically in adjoining bodies of water. Revegetation also aids protection of engineered grades and other earthworks.&lt;ref&gt;A Revegetation Manual For Alaska Stoney J. Wright 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==For conservation==
Revegetation is often used to join up patches of natural habitat that have been lost, and can be a very important tool in places where much of the natural vegetation has been cleared. It is therefore particularly important in urban environments, and research in [[Brisbane]] has shown that revegetation projects can significantly improve urban bird populations&lt;ref&gt;Shanahan, D.F., Miller, C., Possingham, H.P. &amp; Fuller, R.A. 2011. The influence of patch area and connectivity on avian communities in urban revegetation. ''[http://www.fullerlab.org/reveg-shanaha/'' Biological Conservation, 144, 722–729].&lt;/ref&gt; The Brisbane study showed that connecting a revegetation patch with existing habitat improved bird species richness, while simply concentrating on making large patches of habitat was the best way to increase bird abundance. Revegetation plans therefore need to consider how the revegetated sites are connected with existing habitat patches. Revegetation in agricultural areas can support breeding bird populations, but often it supports more common species, rather than those that are in decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00442-008-1221-9 | doi=10.1007/s00442-008-1221-9 | volume=159 | title=Native bird breeding in a chronosequence of revegetated sites | journal=Oecologia | pages=435–446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soil replacement==
[[Mine reclamation]] may involve soil amendment, replacement, or creation, particularly for areas that have been [[strip mining|strip mined]] or suffered severe [[erosion]] or [[soil compaction]]. In some cases, the native soil may be removed prior to construction and replaced with fill for the duration of the work. After construction is completed, the fill is again removed and replaced with the reserved native soil for revegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Revegetation restoration for culvert replacement in a wetland Ashenhurst, Amber;Polzin, Mary Louise 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mycorrhizal communities==
[[Mycorrhizae]], [[symbiotic]] [[fungal]]-plant communities, are important to the success of revegetation efforts. Most woody plant species need these root-fungi communities to thrive, and nursery or [[greenhouse]] transplants may not have sufficient or correct mycorrhizae for good survival. Regional differences in ectomycorrhizal fungi may also affect the success of revegetation.

'''Social marketing''' is the use of marketing theory, skills and practices to achieve social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/social-marketing.html|title=What is social marketing? definition and meaning|website=BusinessDictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the primary goal of achieving "[[Common good|social good]]". Traditional [[commercial marketing]] aims are primarily financial, though they can have positive social affects as well. In the context of public health, social marketing would promote general health, raise awareness and induce changes in behaviour. To see social marketing as only the use of standard commercial marketing practices to achieve non-commercial goals is an [[oversimplification|oversimplified view]].  

Social marketing seeks to develop and integrate [[marketing]] concepts with other approaches to [[social change]]. Social marketing aims to influence behaviors that benefit individuals and communities for the greater social good. The goal is to deliver competition-sensitive and segmented social change programs that are effective, efficient, equitable and sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authors=International Social Marketing Association, European Social Marketing Association &amp; Australian Association of Social Marketing|year=2013|title=Consensus Definition of Social Marketing|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Increasingly, social marketing is described as having "two parents." The "social parent" uses [[social science]] and [[social policy]] approaches. The "marketing parent" uses commercial and public sector [[marketing]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Truss|first=Aiden|title=Social Marketing and Public Health: Theory and practice|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CsEijRnC8GYC|editor=Jeff French |editor2=Clive Blair-Stevens |editor3=Dominic McVey |editor4=Rowena Merritt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent years have also witnessed a broader focus.  Social marketing now goes beyond influencing individual behaviour. It promotes socio-cultural and structural change relevant to social issues.&lt;ref name="Strategic Social Marketing"&gt;{{cite book|last1=French|first1=Jeff|last2=Gordon|first2=Ross|title=Strategic Social Marketing|date=2015|publisher=Sage|isbn=9781446248621|url=https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/strategic-social-marketing/book237965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, social marketing scholars are beginning to advocate for a broader definition of social marketing: "social marketing is the application of marketing principles to enable individual and collective ideas and actions in the pursuit of effective, efficient, equitable, fair and sustained social transformation".
The new emphasis gives equal weight to the effects (efficiency and effectiveness) and the process (equity, fairness and sustainability) of social marketing programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Saunders, S.

==Applications ==
The first documented evidence of the deliberate use of marketing to address a social issue comes from a 1963 [[reproductive health]] program led by [[K. T. Chandy]] at the Indian Institute of Management in Calcutta, India.  Chandy and colleagues proposed, and subsequently implemented, a national [[family planning]] program with high quality, government brand condoms distributed and sold throughout the country at low cost. The program included an integrated consumer marketing campaign run with active point of sale promotion. Retailers were trained to sell the product aggressively, and a new organization was created to implement the program.&lt;ref&gt;Chandy, K.T., Balakrishman, T.R., Kantawalla, J.M., Mohan, K., Sen, N.P., Gupta, S.S. &amp; Srivastva, S. (1965). Proposals for family planning promotion: A marketing plan. Studies in Family Planning;1(6):7-12.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Developing country|developing countries]], the use of social marketing expanded to [[Prevention of HIV/AIDS|HIV prevention]], control of childhood [[diarrhea]] (through the use of [[Oral rehydration therapy|oral re-hydration therapies]]), [[malaria]] control and treatment, [[Portable water purification|point-of-use water treatment]], [[Self-supply of water and sanitation|on-site sanitation]] methods and the provision of basic health services.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, R. C. (2011). An integrative model for social marketing. Journal of Social Marketing;1:54–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health promotion campaigns began applying social marketing in practice in the 1980s. In the United States, The National High Blood Pressure Education Program&lt;ref&gt;Roccella, E.J. &amp; Ward, G.W. (1984). The National High Blood Pressure Education Program: A description of its utility as a generic program model. Health Education Quarterly, 11(3): 225-242&lt;/ref&gt; and the community heart disease prevention studies in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and at Stanford University&lt;ref name="Lefebvre1988"&gt;Lefebvre, R.C. &amp; Flora, J.A. (1988). Social Marketing and Public Health Intervention (Portable Document Format). Health Education Quarterly; 15 (3): 300, 301.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach to address population-based risk factor behaviour change. Notable early developments also took place in Australia. These included the Victoria Cancer Council developing its [[smoking cessation|anti-tobacco]] campaign "Quit" (1988) and "SunSmart" (1988), its campaign against [[skin cancer]] which had the slogan "[[Slip-Slop-Slap|Slip! Slop! Slap!]]"&lt;ref name="VicHealth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/en/About-VicHealth/VicHealth-History-Major-Events-and-Milestones.aspx |title=VicHealth History: Major Events and Milestones |work=VicHealth |publisher=Victorian Health Promotion Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719032451/http://www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/en/About-VicHealth/VicHealth-History-Major-Events-and-Milestones.aspx |archivedate=2009-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, the field has rapidly expanded around the world to include active living communities, disaster preparedness and response, [[ecosystem]] and species conservation, environmental issues, development of volunteer or indigenous workforces, financial literacy, global threats of [[Antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistance]], government corruption, improving the quality of health care, injury prevention, landowner education, [[marine conservation]] and ocean sustainability, patient-centered health care, reducing health disparities, [[sustainable consumption]], transportation demand management, [[water treatment]] and [[sanitation]] systems and youth gambling problems, among other social needs (See&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, R.C. (2013) Social marketing and social change: Strategies and tools for improving health, well-being and the environment. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lefebvre, R.C. 2013"&gt;Lefebvre, R.C. (Ed). Social marketing: Six volume set. London: SAGE Publications, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;).

On a wider front, by 2007, government in the United Kingdom announced the development of its first social marketing strategy for all aspects of health.&lt;ref name="DeptofHealth2004"&gt;UK Department of Health, ''[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4094550 Choosing Health: Making Healthy Choices Easier]'', Cmd.6374 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the US national health objectives&lt;ref name="HealthyPeople2020"&gt;US Department of Health and Human Services, ''[http://healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/objectiveslist.aspx?topicId=18 Health Communication and Health Information Technology]''&lt;/ref&gt; included increasing the number of state health departments that report using social marketing in health promotion and disease prevention programs and increasing the number of schools of public health that offer courses and workforce development activities in social marketing.

Two other public health applications include the CDC's CDCynergy training and software application&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthmarketing/cdcynergy/ |title=CDC - CDCynergy (NCHM) |accessdate=2007-10-19 |date=2006-06-27 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SMART (Social Marketing and Assessment Response Tool) in the U.S.&lt;ref name="SMART"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CTG/is_2-3_18/ai_108194963/ |title=Positioning Social Marketing as a Planning Process for Health Education |accessdate=2012-01-13 |last= Neiger |first=Brad L. |author2=Rosemary Thackeray |author3=Michael D. Barnes |author4= James F. McKenzie  |year=2003 |journal=American Journal of Health Studies |volume=18 |issue=2/3 |pages=75–81 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social marketing theory and practice has been progressed in several countries such as the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the UK, and in the latter a number of key government policy papers have adopted a strategic social marketing approach. Publications such as "Choosing Health" in 2004,&lt;ref name="DeptofHealth2004"/&gt; "[http://www.nsmcentre.org.uk/component/remository/NSMC-Publications/Its-Our-Health-%28Summary-Report%29/ It's our health!]" in 2006 and "[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4139514 Health Challenge England]" in 2006, represent steps to achieve a strategic and operational use of social marketing. In India, [[AIDS]] controlling programs are largely using social marketing and social workers are largely working for it. Most of the social workers are professionally trained for this task.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

A variation of social marketing has emerged as a systematic way to foster more sustainable behavior. Referred to as community-based social marketing (CBSM) by Canadian environmental psychologist Doug McKenzie-Mohr, CBSM strives to change the behavior of communities to reduce their impact on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie-Mohr, D. (2000). Fostering sustainable behavior through community-based social marketing. American Psychologist, 55(5), 531-537.&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing that simply providing information is usually not sufficient to initiate behavior change, CBSM uses tools and findings from social psychology to discover the perceived barriers to behavior change and ways of overcoming these barriers. Among the tools and techniques used by CBSM are focus groups and surveys (to discover barriers) and commitments, prompts, social norms, social diffusion, feedback and incentives (to change behavior). The tools of CBSM have been used to foster sustainable behavior in many areas, including energy conservation,&lt;ref&gt;Schultz P. W., Nolan J. M., Cialdini R. B., Goldstein N. J., Griskevicius Vladas (2007). The Constructive, Destructive, and Reconstructive Power of Social Norms. ''Psychological Science'', 18(5), 429-434.&lt;/ref&gt; environmental regulation&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, A. (2010). Using Community-Based Social Marketing Techniques to Enhance Environmental Regulation. ''Sustainability'', 2(4), 1138-1160&lt;/ref&gt; and recycling.&lt;ref&gt;Haldeman, T. &amp; Turner, J. (2009). Implementing a community-based social marketing program to increase recycling. ''Social Marketing Quarterly'', 15(3), 114-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the concept of strategic social marketing has emerged, which identifies that social change requires action at the individual, community, socio-cultural, political and environmental level, and that social marketing can and should influence policy, strategy and operational tactics to achieve pro-social outcomes.&lt;ref name="Strategic Social Marketing"/&gt;

Other social marketing can be aimed at products deemed, at least by proponents, as socially unacceptable. One of the most notable is [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) which for many years has waged social marketing campaigns against the use of natural fur products. The campaigns' efficacy has been subject to dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peek|first=Liz|title=Warm Weather Torments City Furriers|url=http://www.nysun.com/business/warm-weather-torments-city-furriers/43889/|accessdate=12 March 2013|newspaper=New York Sun|date=November 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all social marketing campaigns are effective everywhere. For example, anti-smoking campaigns such as [[World No Tobacco Day]] while being successful (in concert with government tobacco controls) in curbing the demand for tobacco products in North America and in parts of Europe, have been less effective in other parts of the world such as China, India and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Fedyashin, [Opinion &amp; Analysis: World No Tobacco Day, Futile Attempt to Curb Smoking. http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20090529/155119204.html], RiaNovosti (Russia), May 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; (See also: [[Prevalence of tobacco consumption]])

==Types ==
Social marketing uses the benefits of doing social good to secure and maintain [[customer engagement]]. In social marketing the distinguishing feature is therefore its "primary focus on social good, and it is not a secondary outcome.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Not all public sector and not-for-profit marketing is social marketing.

Public sector bodies can use standard marketing approaches to improve the promotion of their relevant services and organizational aims. This can be very important but should not be confused with social marketing where the focus is on achieving specific behavioral goals with specific audiences in relation to topics relevant to social good (e.g., health, sustainability, recycling, etc.). For example, a 3-month marketing campaign to encourage people to get a H1N1 vaccine is more tactical in nature and should not be considered social marketing. A campaign that promotes and reminds people to get regular check-ups and all of their vaccinations when they're supposed to encourages a long-term behavior change that benefits society. It can therefore be considered social marketing.

Social marketing can be confused with commercial marketing. A commercial marketer may only seek to influence a buyer to purchase a product. Social marketers have more difficult goals.  They want to make potentially difficult and long-term behavior changes in target populations, which may or may not involve purchasing a product.  For example, reducing cigarette smoking or encouraging use of condoms have difficult challenges to overcome that go beyond purchasing decisions.

Social marketing is sometimes seen as being restricted to a client base of non-profit organizations, health services groups, the government agency. However, the goal of inducing social change is not restricted to this narrow spectrum of organizations. Corporations, for example, can be clients.  Public relations or social responsibility departments may champion social causes such funding for the arts, which would involve social marketing.

Social marketing should not be confused with the societal marketing concept which was a forerunner of [[sustainable marketing]] in integrating issues of [[corporate social responsibility|social responsibility]] into commercial marketing strategies. In contrast to that, social marketing uses commercial marketing theories, tools and techniques to social issues.

Social marketing applies a "customer oriented" approach and uses the concepts and tools used by commercial marketers in pursuit of social goals like anti-smoking campaigns or fund raising for NGOs.

Social marketers must create competitive advantage by constantly adapting to and instigating change. With climate change in mind, adaptations to market changes are likely to be more successful if actions are guided by knowledge of the forces shaping market behaviours and insights that enable the development of sustainable competitive advantages.&lt;ref&gt;Shocker, Allan D., Rajendra K. Srivastava, and Robert W. Ruekert. "Challenges and Opportunities Facing Brand Management: An Introduction to the Special Issue." Journal of Marketing Research 31.2 (1994): 149. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Jupitermedia]] announced its "Social Marketing" service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://socialmarketing.blogs.com/r_craiig_lefebvres_social/2006/08/hello_jupiter_a.html |title=Hello Jupiter?

Despite protests from the social marketing communities over the perceived hijacking of the term, Jupiter stuck with the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://weblogs.jupiterresearch.com/analysts/schatsky/archives/016969.html |title=Social Marketing vs. Social Marketing |accessdate=2006-09-01 |last=Schatsky |first=David |date=2006-09-01 |work=Jupiterresearch Analyst Weblogs |publisher=Jupitermedia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303050738/http://weblogs.jupiterresearch.com/analysts/schatsky/archives/016969.html |archivedate=2007-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jupiter's approach is more correctly (and commonly) referred to as [[social media optimization]].

==History ==

Many scholars ascribe the beginning of the field of social marketing to an article published by G.D. Wiebe in the Winter 1951-1952 edition of ''[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wiebe|first=G.D.|title=Merchandising Commodities and Citizenship on Television|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1951–1952|volume=15|issue=Winter|pages=679|doi=10.1086/266353}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Wiebe posed a rhetorical question: "Why can’t you sell brotherhood and rational thinking like you can sell soap?” He then went on to discuss what he saw as the challenges of attempting to sell a social good as if it were a commodity, thus identifying social marketing (though he did not label it as such) as a discipline unique from c
mmodity marketing. Yet, Wilkie &amp; Moore (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Wilkie, W. L., &amp; Moore, E. S. (2003). Scholarly research in marketing: Exploring the “4 eras” of thought development. Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing; 22(2):116–146.&lt;/ref&gt; note that the marketing discipline has been involved with questions about the intersection of marketing and society since its earliest days as a discipline.

A decade later, organizations such as the [[KfW Entwicklungsbank]] in Germany, the Canadian International Development Agency, the Ministry for
Foreign Affairs in The Netherlands, UK Department for International Development, [[US Agency for International Development]], [[World Health Organization]] and the [[World Bank]] began sponsoring social marketing interventions to improve family planning and achieve other social goals in Africa, Sri Lanka, and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Michael|title=The Marketing Book|year=2012|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Oxford|pages=696}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lefebvre|first=R. Craig|title=Social Marketing and Social Change: Strategies and Tools to Improve Health, Well-Being and the Environment\year=2013|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next milestone in the evolution of social marketing was the publication of "Social Marketing: An Approach to Planned Social Change" in the ''[[Journal of Marketing]]'' by [[Philip Kotler]] and [[Gerald Zaltman]].&lt;ref name="Kotler 1971"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kotler|first=Philip|author2=Gerald Zaltman |title=Social Marketing: An Approach to Planned Social Change|journal=Journal of Marketing|date=July 1971|volume=35|pages=3–12|url=https://www.sfu.ca/cmns/faculty/laba_m/425/07-fall/documents/Kotler-Zaltman.PDF|doi=10.2307/1249783}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kotler and Zaltman coined the term 'social marketing' and defined it as "the design, implementation, and control of programs calculated to influence the acceptability of social ideas and involving considerations of product planning, pricing, communication, distribution, and marketing research." They conclude that "social marketing appears to represent a bridging mechanism which links the behavior scientist's knowledge of human behavior with the socially useful implementation of what that knowledge allows."

Craig Lefebvre and June Flora introduced social marketing to the public health community in 1988,&lt;ref name="Lefebvre1988"/&gt; where it has been most widely used and explored. They noted that there was a need for "large scale, broad-based, behavior change focused programs" to improve public health (the community wide prevention of cardiovascular diseases in their respective projects) and outlined eight essential components of social marketing that still hold today:
#A consumer orientation to realize organizational (social) goals
#An emphasis on the voluntary exchanges of goods and services between providers and consumers
#Research in audience analysis and segmentation strategies
#The use of formative research in product and message design and the pretesting of these materials
#An analysis of distribution (or communication) channels
#Use of the [[marketing mix]]—using and blending product, price, place and promotion characteristics in intervention planning and implementation
#A process tracking system with both integrative and control functions
#A management process that involves problem analysis, planning, implementation and feedback functions&lt;ref name="Lefebvre"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lefebvre |first=R. Craig |author2=June A. Flora  |year=1988 |title=Social Marketing and Public Health Intervention |journal=Health Education Quarterly |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=300, 301 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |url=http://socialmarketing.blogs.com/Publications/Social_Marketing_and_Public_Health_Intervention.pdf |format=Portable Document Format |accessdate=2008-04-30 |doi=10.1177/109019818801500305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking of what they termed "social change campaigns", Kotler and [[Ned Roberto]] introduced the subject by writing, "A social change campaign is an organized effort conducted by one group (the change agent) which attempts to persuade others (the target adopters) to accept, modify, or abandon certain ideas, attitudes, practices or behavior." Their 1989 text was updated in 2002 by [[Philip Kotler]], [[Ned Roberto]] and Nancy Lee.&lt;ref name="Kotler2002"&gt;Kotler, Philip, Ned Roberto and Nancy Lee. ''Social Marketing: Improving the Quality of Life'', SAGE, 2002. ({{ISBN|0-7619-2434-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[University of Stirling]] was the first university to open a dedicated research institute to Social Marketing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ism.stir.ac.uk/|title=Institute for Social Marketing – University of Stirling|author=|date=|website=www.ism.stir.ac.uk|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 2007, [[Middlesex University]] became the first university to offer a specialized [[postgraduate]] programme in Health &amp; Social Marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Source: {{cite web|url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/marketing/health_soc_marketing_ma.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524003618/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/marketing/health_soc_marketing_ma.aspx |archivedate=2010-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years there has been an important development to distinguish between "strategic social marketing" and "operational social marketing".

Much of the literature and case examples focus on operational social marketing, using it to achieve specific behavioral goals in relation to different audiences and topics. However, there has been increasing efforts to ensure social marketing goes "upstream" and is used much more strategically to inform policy formulation and strategy development. Here the focus is less on specific audience and topic work but uses strong customer understanding and insight to inform and guide effective policy and strategy development.

Social marketing is also being explored as a method for social innovation, a framework to increase the adoption of evidence-based practices among professionals and organizations, and as a core skill for public sector managers and social entrepreneurs. It is being viewed as an approach to design more effective, efficient, equitable and sustainable approaches to enhance social well-being that extends beyond individual behavior change to include creating positive shifts in social networks and social norms, businesses, markets and public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, R.C. (2013). Social marketing and social change: Strategies and tools for improving health, well-being and the environment. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many examples exist of social marketing research, with over 120 papers compiled in a six volume set.&lt;ref name="Lefebvre, R.C. 2013"/&gt;). For example, research now shows ways to reduce the intentions of people to binge drink or engage in dangerous driving. Martin, Lee, Weeks and Kaya (2013) suggests that understanding consumer personality and how people view others is important. People were shown ads talking of the harmful effects of binge drinking. People who valued close friends as a sense of who they are were less likely to want to binge drink after seeing an ad featuring them and a close friend. People who were loners or who did not see close friends important to their sense of who they were reacted better to ads featuring an individual. A similar pattern was shown for ads showing a person driving at dangerous speeds. This suggests ads showing potential harm to citizens from binge drinking or dangerous driving are less effective than ads highlighting a person’s close friends.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Brett A. S., Christina K.C. Lee, Clinton Weeks and Maria Kaya (2013), [http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Martin-et-al.-2013.pdf "How to stop binge drinking and speeding motorists: Effects of relational-interdependent self-construable and self-referencing on attitudes toward social marketing "] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427160914/http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Martin-et-al.-2013.pdf |date=2015-04-27 }}, ''Journal of Consumer Behavior'', 12, 81-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''spatial network''' (sometimes also '''[[Geometric graph theory|geometric graph]]''') is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] in which the [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] or [[Edge (graph theory)|edges]] are ''spatial elements'' associated with [[Geometry|geometric]] objects, i.e. the nodes are located in a space equipped with a certain [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]].&lt;ref name="Bart"&gt;M. Barthelemy, "Spatial Networks", Physics Reports 499:1-101 (2011) ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0302 ).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bart2"&gt;M. Barthelemy, "Morphogenesis of Spatial Networks", Springer (2018).&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest mathematical realization is a [[Lattice graph|lattice]] or a [[random geometric graph]], where nodes are distributed uniformly at random over a two-dimensional plane; a pair of nodes are connected if the [[Euclidean distance]] is smaller than a given neighborhood radius. [[Transport network|Transportation and mobility networks]], [[Internet]], [[cellular network|mobile phone networks]], [[electrical grid|power grids]], [[social network|social and contact networks]] and [[neural network]]s are all examples where the underlying space is relevant and where the graph's [[topology]] alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure, resilience and the evolution of spatial networks is crucial for many different fields ranging from urbanism to epidemiology.

== Examples ==
An urban spatial network can be constructed by abstracting intersections as nodes and streets as links, which is referred to as, [[Transportation network (graph theory)|transportation network]]. Beijing traffic was studied as a dynamic network and its percolation properties have been found useful to identify systematic bottlenecks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=D.|last2=Fu|first2=B.|last3=Wang|first3=Y.|last4=Lu|first4=G.|last5=Berezin|first5=Y.|last6=Stanley|first6=H.E.|last7=Havlin|first7=S.|date=2015|title=Percolation transition in dynamical traffic network with evolving critical bottlenecks|url=|journal=PNAS|volume=112|pages=669|via=|bibcode=2015PNAS..112..669L|doi=10.1073/pnas.1419185112|pmc=4311803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One might think of the 'space map' as being the negative image of the standard map, with the open space cut out of the background buildings or walls.&lt;ref name="SocLo"&gt;Hillier B, Hanson J, 1984, The social logic of space (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characterizing spatial networks==
The following aspects are some of the characteristics to examine a spatial network:&lt;ref name="Bart" /&gt;
* Planar networks
In many applications, such as rail, roads, and other transportation networks the network is assumed to be [[planar graph|planar]]. Planar networks build up an important group out of the spatial networks, but not all spatial networks are planar. Indeed, the airline passenger
networks is a non-planar example: All airports in the world are connected through direct flights. 
* The way it is embedded in space
There are examples of networks, which seem to be not "directly" embedded in space. Social networks for instance
connect individuals through friendship relations. But in this case, space intervenes in the fact that the connection
probability between two individuals usually decreases with the distance between them.
* Voronoi tessellation
A spatial network can be represented by a [[Voronoi diagram]], which is a way of dividing space into a number of regions.  The dual graph for a Voronoi diagram corresponds to the [[Delaunay triangulation]] for the same set of points.
Voronoi tessellations are interesting for spatial networks in the sense that they provide a natural representation model
to which one can compare a real world network.
* Mixing space and topology

[[File:Lattice network 2d.png|alt=Lattice network in two dimensions|thumb|Fig. 1. Lattice network in two dimensions. The balls are the nodes the edges connecting neighboring nodes are the links.]]
[[File:Spatially interdependent networks.png|alt=Spatially interdependent networks|thumb|Fig. 2. Spatially interdependent networks. Two square lattices A and B, where in each lattice a node has two types of links: connectivity links and dependency links. Every node is connected (with connectivity links) to its four nearest neighbors within the same lattice via connectivity links and a fraction of nodes in each network have dependency links to the other network. If a node fail in one network its dependent node in the other network will also fail, even if it is still connected to its network via connectivity links.]]
Examining the topology of the nodes and edges itself is another way to characterize networks.  The distribution of [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] of the nodes is often considered, regarding the structure of edges it is useful to find the [[Minimum spanning tree]], or the generalization, the [[Steiner tree]] and the [[relative neighborhood graph]].
[[File:Lattice-layout-z15.png|thumb|Fig. 3:  Spatially embedded multiplex networks. The nodes occupy regular locations in two-dimensional lattice  while the links in each layer (blue and green) have lengths
that are exponentially distributed with characteristic length
ζ = 3 and are connected at random with degree k=4.]]

==Lattice networks==
 
Lattice networks (see Fig. 1) are useful models  for spatial embedded networks. Many physical phenomenas have been studied on these structures. Examples include Ising model for spontaneous magnetization,&lt;ref name="McCoyWu1968"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCoy|first1=Barry M.|last2=Wu|first2=Tai Tsun|title=Theory of a Two-Dimensional Ising Model with Random Impurities.

==Probability and spatial networks ==
In the "real" world many aspects of networks are not deterministic - randomness plays an important role. For example, new links, representing friendships, in social networks are in a certain manner random. Modelling spatial networks in respect of stochastic operations is consequent. In many cases the [[spatial Poisson process]] is used to approximate data sets of processes on spatial networks. Other stochastic aspects of interest are: 
* The [[Poisson line process]]
* Stochastic geometry: the [[Erdős–Rényi model|Erdős–Rényi graph]]
* [[Percolation theory]]

==Approach from the theory of space syntax==
Another definition of spatial network derives from the theory of [[space syntax]]. It can be notoriously difficult to decide what a spatial element should be in complex spaces involving large open areas or many interconnected paths. The originators of space syntax, Bill Hillier and Julienne Hanson use [[axial line]]s and [[convex space]]s as the spatial elements. Loosely, an axial line is the 'longest line of sight and access' through open space, and a convex space the 'maximal convex polygon' that can be drawn in open space. Each of these elements is defined by the geometry of the local boundary in different regions of the space map. Decomposition of a space map into a complete set of intersecting axial lines or overlapping convex spaces produces the axial map or overlapping convex map respectively. Algorithmic definitions of these maps exist, and this allows the mapping from an arbitrary shaped space map to a network amenable to graph mathematics to be carried out in a relatively well defined manner. Axial maps are used to analyse [[urban network]]s, where the system generally comprises linear segments, whereas convex maps are more often used to analyse [[building|building plans]] where space patterns are often more convexly articulated, however both convex and axial maps may be used in either situation.

Currently, there is a move within the space syntax community to integrate better with [[geographic information system]]s (GIS), and much of the [[Spatial network analysis software|software]] they produce interlinks with commercially available GIS systems.

==History==
While networks and graphs were already for a long time the subject
of many studies in [[mathematics]], physics, mathematical sociology,
[[computer science]], spatial networks have been studied intensively during the 1970s in quantitative geography. Objects of studies in geography are inter alia locations, activities and flows of individuals, but also networks evolving in time and space.&lt;ref name="NetAnal"&gt;P. Haggett and R.J. Chorley. ''Network analysis in geog-
raphy''. Edward Arnold, London, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the important problems such
as the location of nodes of a network, the evolution of
transportation networks and their interaction with population
and activity density are addressed in these earlier
studies. On the other side, many important points still remain unclear, partly because at that time datasets of large networks and larger computer capabilities were lacking.  
Recently, spatial networks have been the subject of studies in [[Statistics]], to connect probabilities and stochastic processes with networks in the real world.&lt;ref name="David"&gt;http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/206-SNET/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3374">In [[industrial engineering]], the '''standard time''' is the time required by an average skilled operator, working at
a normal pace, to perform a specified task using a prescribed method.&lt;ref&gt;Zandin 2001, Section X, Chapter 5.1&lt;/ref&gt; It includes appropriate allowances to allow the person to recover from [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and, where necessary, an additional allowance to cover contingent elements which may occur but have not been observed.

Standard time =normal time +allowance 
Where; normal time =avg time *rating factor. 
(take rating factor between 1.1 and 1.2)

==Usage of the standard time==

Time times for all operations are known. 
* [[Workforce planning|Staffing (or workforce planning)]]: the number of workers required cannot accurately be determined unless the time required to process the existing work is known.
* [[Production leveling|Line balancing (or production leveling)]]: the correct number of workstations for optimum work flow depends on the processing time, or standard, at each workstation.
* [[Material requirements planning|Materials requirement planning (MRP)]]: MRP systems cannot operate properly without accurate work standards.
* [[Systems Simulation|System simulation]]: simulation models cannot accurately simulate operation unless times for all operations are known.
* [[Wage payment systems|Wage payment]]: comparing expected performance with actual performance requires the use of work standards.
* [[Cost accounting]]: work standards are necessary for determining not only the labor component of costs, but also the correct allocation of production costs to specific products.
* Employee evaluation: in order to assess whether individual employees are performing as well as they should, a performance standard is necessary against which to measure the level of performance.

==Techniques to establish a standard time==
The standard time can be determined using the following techniques:&lt;ref&gt;Groover 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Time study]],
# [[Predetermined motion time system]] aka PMTS or PTS,
#Standard data system,
#[[Work sampling]].

==Method of calculation==
The Standard Time is the product of three factors:
#Observed time: The time measured to complete the task.
#Performance rating factor: The pace the person is working at. 90% is working slower than normal, 110% is working faster than normal, 100% is normal.  This factor is calculated by an experienced worker who is trained to observe and determine the rating.
#[[PFD allowance|Personal, fatigue, and delay (PFD) allowance]].

The standard time can then be calculated by using:&lt;ref&gt;Groover 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

 &lt;math&gt;\text{Standard Time} = (\text{Observed Time})(\text{Rating Factor})(1+\text{PFD Allowance})&lt;/math&gt;

In the [[finite element method]] for the numerical solution of elliptic [[partial differential equations]], the '''stiffness matrix''' represents the system of linear equations that must be solved in order to ascertain an approximate solution to the differential equation.

==The stiffness matrix for the Poisson problem==
For simplicity, we will first consider the [[Poisson problem]]

:&lt;math&gt; -\nabla^2 u = f&lt;/math&gt;

on some domain Ω, subject to the boundary condition ''u'' = 0 on the boundary of Ω. To discretize this equation by the finite element method, one chooses a set of ''basis functions'' {''φ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} defined on Ω which also vanish on the boundary. One then approximates

:&lt;math&gt; u \approx u^h = u_1\varphi_1+\cdots+u_n\varphi_n.&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are determined so that the error in the approximation is orthogonal to each basis function ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_\Omega \varphi_i\cdot f \, dx = -\int_\Omega \varphi_i\nabla^2u^h \, dx = -\sum_j\left(\int_\Omega \varphi_i\nabla^2\varphi_j\,dx\right)\, u_j = \sum_j\left(\int_\Omega \nabla\varphi_i\cdot\nabla\varphi_j\, dx\right)u_j.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''stiffness matrix''' is the n-element square matrix A defined by

:&lt;math&gt; A_{ij} = \int_\Omega\nabla\varphi_i\cdot\nabla\varphi_j\, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

By defining the vector ''F'' with components ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega\varphi_i f\,dx&lt;/math&gt;, the coefficients ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are determined by the linear system ''AU'' = ''F''. The stiffness matrix is symmetric, i.e. ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''ji''&lt;/sub&gt;, so all its eigenvalues are real. Moreover, it is a strictly [[positive-definite matrix]], so that the system ''AU'' = ''F'' always has a unique solution. (For other problems, these nice properties will be lost.)

Note that the stiffness matrix will be different depending on the computational grid used for the domain and what type of finite element is used. For example, the stiffness matrix when piecewise quadratic finite elements are used will have more degrees of freedom than piecewise linear elements.

==The stiffness matrix for other problems==
Determining the stiffness matrix for other PDE follows essentially the same procedure, but it can be complicated by the choice of boundary conditions. As a more complex example, consider the elliptic equation

:&lt;math&gt; -\sum_{k,l}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_k}\left(a^{kl}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_l}\right) = f&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A''(''x'') = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''kl''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') is a positive-definite matrix defined for each point ''x'' in the domain. We impose  the [[Robin boundary condition]]

:&lt;math&gt; -\sum_{k,l}\nu_k a^{kl}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_l} = c(u-g),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ν''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is the component of the unit outward normal vector ''ν'' in the ''k''-th direction. The system to be solved is

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_j\left(\sum_{k,l}\int_\Omega a^{kl}\frac{\partial\varphi_i}{\partial x_k}\frac{\partial\varphi_j}{\partial x_l}dx+\int_{\partial\Omega}c\varphi_i\varphi_j\, ds\right)u_j = \int_\Omega\varphi_i f\, dx+\int_{\partial\Omega}c\varphi_i g\, ds,&lt;/math&gt;

as can be shown using an analogue of Green's identity. The coefficients ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are still found by solving a system of linear equations, but the matrix representing the system is markedly different from that for the ordinary Poisson problem.

In general, to each scalar elliptic operator ''L'' of order 2''k'', there is associated a bilinear form ''B'' on the [[Sobolev space]] ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, so that the [[weak formulation]] of the equation ''Lu'' = ''f'' is

:&lt;math&gt; B[u,v] = (f,v)&lt;/math&gt;

for all functions ''v'' in ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;. Then the stiffness matrix for this problem is

:&lt;math&gt; A_{ij} = B[\varphi_j,\varphi_i].&lt;/math&gt;

==Practical assembly of the stiffness matrix==
In order to implement the finite element method on a computer, one must first choose a set of basis functions and then compute the integrals defining the stiffness matrix. Usually, the domain Ω is discretized by some form of [[mesh generation]], wherein it is divided into non-overlapping triangles or quadrilaterals, which are generally referred to as elements. The basis functions are then chosen to be polynomials of some order within each element, and continuous across element boundaries. The simplest choices are piecewise linear for triangular elements and piecewise bilinear for rectangular elements.

The '''element stiffness matrix''' ''A''&lt;sup&gt;[''k'']&lt;/sup&gt; for element ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is the matrix

:&lt;math&gt; A^{[k]}_{ij} = \int_{T_k}\nabla\varphi_i\cdot\nabla\varphi_j\, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

The element stiffness matrix is zero for most values of i and j, for which the corresponding basis functions are zero within ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. The full stiffness matrix ''A'' is the sum of the element stiffness matrices. In particular, for basis functions that are only supported locally, the stiffness matrix is [[sparse matrix|sparse]].

For many standard choices of basis functions, i.e. piecewise linear basis functions on triangles, there are simple formulas for the element stiffness matrices. For example, for piecewise linear elements, consider a triangle with vertices (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), (''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and define the 2×3 matrix

:&lt;math&gt; D = \left[\begin{matrix}x_3 - x_2 &amp; x_1 - x_3 &amp; x_2 - x_1 \\ y_3 - y_2 &amp; y_1 - y_3 &amp; y_2 - y_1\end{matrix}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Then the element stiffness matrix is

:&lt;math&gt; A^{[k]} = D^\mathsf{T} D/(4 \operatorname{area}(T)).&lt;/math&gt;

When the differential equation is more complicated, say by having an inhomogeneous diffusion coefficient, the integral defining the element stiffness matrix can be evaluated by [[Gaussian quadrature]].

The [[condition number]] of the stiffness matrix depends strongly on the quality of the numerical grid. In particular, triangles with small angles in the finite element mesh induce large eigenvalues of the stiffness matrix, degrading the solution quality.

In [[botany]], a '''stoma''' (plural "stomata"), also called a '''stomata''' (plural "stomates")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Living Environment—Regents High school examination|url=http://www.nysedregents.org/LivingEnvironment/Archive/20110125-le-examrev.pdf|work=January 2011 Regents|publisher=NYSED|accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:στόμα|στόμα]], "mouth"),&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|sto/ma|στόμα|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a pore, found in the epidermis of leaves, stems, and other organs, that facilitates [[gas exchange]]. The pore is bordered by a pair of specialized [[parenchyma]] cells known as [[guard cell]]s that are responsible for regulating the size of the stomatal opening.

The term is usually used collectively to refer to the entire stomatal complex, consisting of the paired guard cells and the pore itself, which is referred to as the stomatal aperture.&lt;ref name="Esau"&gt;{{cite book | last=Esau | first=K. | year=1977 | title=Anatomy of Seed Plants | publisher=Wiley and Sons | page=88 | isbn=0-471-24520-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Air enters the plant through these openings by gaseous [[diffusion]], and  contains [[carbon dioxide]] and [[oxygen]], which are used in [[photosynthesis]] and [[Cellular respiration|respiration]], respectively. Oxygen produced as a by-product of photosynthesis diffuses out to the atmosphere through these same openings. Also, [[water vapor]] diffuses through the stomata into the atmosphere in a process called [[transpiration]].

Stomata are present in the [[sporophyte]] generation of all [[land plant]] groups except [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]]. In vascular plants the number, size and distribution of stomata varies widely. [[Dicotyledon]]s usually have more stomata on the lower surface of the leaves than the upper surface. [[Monocotyledon]]s such as [[onion]], [[oat]] and [[maize]] may have about the same number of stomata on both leaf surfaces.&lt;ref name=Weyers&gt;{{cite book |first1=J. D.

==Function==
[[File:Stoma with Accompanying Guard Cells.jpg|thumb|Electron micrograph of a stoma from a ''Brassica chinensis'' (Bok Choy) leaf]]

===CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gain and water loss===
Carbon dioxide, a key reactant in photosynthesis, is present in the atmosphere at a concentration of about 400 ppm. Most plants require the stomata to be open during daytime. The air spaces in the leaf are saturated with water vapour, which exits the leaf through the stomata; this is known as [[transpiration]]. Therefore, plants cannot gain carbon dioxide without simultaneously losing water vapour.&lt;ref&gt;Debbie Swarthout and C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Stomata ''Stomata''. Encyclopedia of Earth]. National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative approaches===
Ordinarily, carbon dioxide is fixed to [[ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate]] (RuBP) by the enzyme [[RuBisCO]] in mesophyll cells exposed directly to the air spaces inside the leaf. This exacerbates the transpiration problem for two reasons: first, RuBisCo has a relatively low affinity for carbon dioxide, and second, it fixes oxygen to RuBP, wasting energy and carbon in a process called [[photorespiration]]. For both of these reasons, RuBisCo needs high carbon dioxide concentrations, which means wide stomatal apertures and, as a consequence, high water loss.

Narrower stomatal apertures can be used in conjunction with an intermediary molecule with a high carbon dioxide affinity, PEPcase ([[Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase]]). Retrieving the products of carbon fixation from PEPCase is an energy-intensive process, however. As a result, the PEPCase alternative is preferable only where water is limiting but light is plentiful, or where high temperatures increase the solubility of oxygen relative to that of carbon dioxide, magnifying RuBisCo's oxygenation problem.

===CAM plants===

[[File:Diffrences in Stomata Opening Throughout the Day for C3 plants and CAM plants (1).svg|thumb|C3 and C4 plants(1) stomata stay open all day and close at night. CAM plants(2) stomata open during the morning and close slightly at noon and then open again in the evening.]]

A group of mostly desert plants called "CAM" plants ([[Crassulacean acid metabolism]], after the family Crassulaceae, which includes the species in which the CAM process was first discovered) open their stomata at night (when water evaporates more slowly from leaves for a given degree of stomatal opening), use PEPcarboxylase to fix carbon dioxide and store the products in large vacuoles. The following day, they close their stomata and release the carbon dioxide fixed the previous night into the presence of [[RuBisCO]]. This saturates RuBisCO with carbon dioxide, allowing minimal photorespiration. This approach, however, is severely limited by the capacity to store fixed carbon in the vacuoles, so it is preferable only when water is severely limiting.

===Opening and closure===
{{details|Guard cell}}
[[File:Opening and Closing of Stoma.svg|400px|thumb|Opening and closing of stoma.]]

However, most plants do not have the aforementioned facility and must therefore open and close their stomata during the daytime, in response to changing conditions, such as light intensity, humidity, and carbon dioxide concentration. It is not entirely certain how these responses work. However, the basic mechanism involves regulation of osmotic pressure.

When conditions are conducive to stomatal opening (e.g., high light intensity and high humidity), a [[proton pump]] drives [[protons]] (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) from the [[guard cell]]s. This means that the cells' [[electrical potential]] becomes increasingly negative. The negative potential opens potassium voltage-gated channels and so an uptake of [[potassium]] ions (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) occurs. To maintain this internal negative voltage so that entry of potassium ions does not stop, negative ions balance the influx of potassium. In some cases, chloride ions enter, while in other plants the organic ion malate is produced in guard cells. This increase in solute concentration lowers the [[water potential]] inside the cell, which results in the diffusion of water into the cell through [[osmosis]]. This increases the cell's volume and [[osmotic pressure|turgor pressure]]. Then, because of rings of cellulose [[microfibrils]] that prevent the width of the guard cells from swelling, and thus only allow the extra turgor pressure to elongate the guard cells, whose ends are held firmly in place by surrounding [[epidermis (botany)|epidermal]] cells, the two guard cells lengthen by bowing apart from one another, creating an open pore through which gas can move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Second, this stops the uptake of any further K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; into the cells and, subsequently, the loss of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The loss of these solutes causes an increase in [[water potential]], which results in the diffusion of water back out of the cell by [[osmosis]]. This makes the cell [[plasmolysed]], which results in the closing of the stomatal pores.

Guard cells have more chloroplasts than the other epidermal cells from which guard cells are derived. Their function is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://6e.plantphys.net/essay10.01.html |title=Guard Cell Photosynthesis |accessdate=2015-10-04 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Inferring stomatal behavior from gas exchange===
The degree of stomatal resistance can be determined by measuring leaf gas exchange of a leaf. The [[transpiration]] rate is dependent on the [[diffusion]] resistance provided by the stomatal pores, and also on the [[humidity]] gradient between the leaf's internal air spaces and the outside air. Stomatal resistance (or its inverse, [[stomatal conductance]]) can therefore be calculated from the transpiration rate and humidity gradient. This allows scientists to investigate how stomata respond to changes in environmental conditions, such as light intensity and concentrations of gases such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and [[ozone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v448/n7152/full/448396b.html |first=Michael |last=Hopkin |title=Carbon sinks threatened by increasing ozone |journal=Nature |volume=448 |pages=396–397 |date=2007-07-26 |bibcode=2007Natur.448..396H |doi=10.1038/448396b |issue=7152 |pmid=17653153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evaporation (''E'') can be calculated as;&lt;ref name=calculations&gt;{{cite web |url=http://4e.plantphys.net/article.php?ch=9&amp;id=134 |title=Calculating Important Parameters in Leaf Gas Exchange |work=Plant Physiology Online|publisher=Sinauer |accessdate=2013-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; E = (e_{i} - e_{a})/Pr&lt;/math&gt;

where ''e''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and ''e''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; are the partial pressures of water in the leaf and in the ambient air, respectively, ''P'' is atmospheric pressure, and ''r'' is stomatal resistance.
The inverse of ''r'' is conductance to water vapor (''g''), so the equation can be rearranged to;&lt;ref name=calculations/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;E = (e_{i} - e_{a})g/P&lt;/math&gt;

and solved for ''g'';&lt;ref name=calculations/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;g = EP / (e_{i} - e_{a})&lt;/math&gt;

Photosynthetic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; assimilation (''A'') can be calculated from

&lt;math&gt;A = (C_{a} - C_{i})g/1.6P&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are the atmospheric and sub-stomatal partial pressures of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. The rate of evaporation from a leaf can be determined using a [[photosynthesis system]]. These scientific instruments measure the amount of water vapour leaving the leaf and the vapor pressure of the ambient air. Photosynthetic systems may calculate [[water use efficiency]] (''A/E''), ''g'', intrinsic water use efficiency (''A/g''), and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. These scientific instruments are commonly used by plant physiologists to measure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake and thus measure photosynthetic rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Evolution==

However, the evolution of stomata must have happened at the same time as the waxy [[Plant cuticle|cuticle]] was evolving&amp;nbsp;– these two traits together constituted a major advantage for early terrestrial plants.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Development==
There are three major epidermal cell types which all ultimately derive from the outermost (L1) tissue layer of the [[shoot apical meristem]], called protodermal cells: [[trichome]]s, [[pavement cells]] and [[guard cell]]s, all of which are arranged in a non-random fashion.

An asymmetrical cell division occurs in protodermal cells resulting in one large cell that is fated to become a pavement cell and a smaller cell called a meristemoid that will eventually differentiate into the guard cells that surround a stoma. This meristemoid then divides asymmetrically one to three times before differentiating into a guard mother cell. The guard mother cell then makes one symmetrical division, which forms a pair of guard cells.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bergmann|first=Dominique C.; Lukowitz, Wolfgang; Somerville, Chris R.|last2=Lukowitz|first2=W|last3=Somerville|first3=CR|date=4 July 2004|title=Stomatal Development and Pattern Controlled by a MAPKK Kinase|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/ful/304/5676/1494/DC1|journal=Science|volume=304|issue=5676|pages=1494–1497|doi=10.1126/science.1096014|pmid=15178800|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|bibcode=2004Sci...304.1494B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cell division is inhibited in some cells so there is always at least one cell between stomata.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pillitteri|first=Lynn Jo|last2=Dong|first2=Juan|date=2013-06-06|year=|title=Stomatal Development in Arabidopsis|journal=The Arabidopsis Book / American Society of Plant Biologists|volume=11|page=e0162|doi=10.1199/tab.0162|issn=1543-8120|pmc=3711358|pmid=23864836|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stomatal patterning is controlled by the interaction of many [[signal transduction]] components such as ''EPF'' (Epidermal Patterning Factor), ''ERL'' (ERecta Like) and ''YODA'' (a putative [[MAP kinase kinase kinase]]).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Mutations in any one of the genes which encode these factors may alter the development of stomata in the epidermis.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For example, a mutation in one gene causes more stomata that are clustered together, hence is called Too Many Mouths (''TMM'').&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Whereas, disruption of the ''SPCH'' (SPeecCHless) gene prevents stomatal development all together.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;Activation of stomatal production can occur by the activation of EPF1, which activates TMM/ERL, which together activate YODA. YODA inhibits SPCH, causing SPCH activity to decrease, allowing for asymmetrical cell division that initiates stomata formation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Casson|first=Stuart A|last2=Hetherington|first2=Alistair M|date=2010-02-01|title=Environmental regulation of stomatal development|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369526609001101|journal=Current Opinion in Plant Biology|volume=13|issue=1|pages=90–95|doi=10.1016/j.pbi.2009.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stomatal development is also coordinated by the cellular peptide signal called stomagen, which signals the inhibition of the SPCH, resulting in increased number of stomata.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sugano|first=Shigeo S.|last2=Shimada|first2=Tomoo|last3=Imai|first3=Yu|last4=Okawa|first4=Katsuya|last5=Tamai|first5=Atsushi|last6=Mori|first6=Masashi|last7=Hara-Nishimura|first7=Ikuko|date=2010-01-14|title=Stomagen positively regulates stomatal density in Arabidopsis|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v463/n7278/full/nature08682.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=463|issue=7278|pages=241–244|doi=10.1038/nature08682|issn=0028-0836|bibcode=2010Natur.463..241S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental and hormonal factors can affect stomatal development. Light increases stomatal development in plants; while, plants grown in the dark have a lower amount of stomata. [[Auxin]] represses stomatal development by affecting their development at the receptor level like the ERL and TMM receptors. However, a low concentration of auxin allows for equal division of a guard mother cell and increases the chance of producing guard cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Balcerowicz | first1 = M. | last2 = Ranjan | first2 = A. | last3 = Rupprecht | first3 = L. | last4 = Fiene | first4 = G. | last5 = Hoecker | first5 = U. | year = 2014 | title = Auxin represses stomatal development in dark-grown seedling via Aux/IAA proteins | url = | journal = Development | volume = 141 | issue = | pages = 3165–3176 | doi=10.1242/dev.109181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Different classifications of stoma types exist. One that is widely used is based on the types that [[Julien Joseph Vesque]] introduced in 1889, was further developed by Metcalfe and Chalk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1= C.R.|last1= Metcalfe|first2= L.|last2= Chalk|year= 1950|title= Anatomy of Dicotyledons|volume= 1: Leaves, Stem, and Wood in relation to Taxonomy, with notes on economic Uses|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later complemented by other authors. It is based on the size, shape and arrangement of the subsidiary cells that surround the two guard cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first= W.R.F.|last= van Cotthem|year= 1970|title= A Classification of Stomatal Types|journal= [[Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society]]|volume= 63|pages= 235–246|url= https://watermark.silverchair.com/j.1095-8339.1970.tb02321.x.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAdIwggHOBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggG_MIIBuwIBADCCAbQGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMZc5ze1pDGmCiI4oRAgEQgIIBhTvmZXmsjbrwO6wcpDcSw61vJXuluEU5pqrcwTM31yL7Z03bIAazXRxr4O-yEAPJRJnpWkLw5n1mm8PbjHcG0BKt-B8KJcOJJ2Y0C6OV_rEAQm6wfdC6Rl-ONnY2fVJHLYOH4u8sBQ0GQ92M8FFKWkmAvDv5in4wdW_8bKhOxlLnelRVvyubsm9yQ9PBNhQ5UFy9HP4fyIX_DU04jFrHnJYxZ0gRjtfsPqqyxRMYSNJoNIwkddbViM8YR9uyOKvcXzPGAVDZ3MtGKBRYpEiSR_-XXGkvxGkSLR4j97oiBxSd04IYheCckZBdV6Dmnydc45xT919SEtNmJTX6NXZKNLpdJS-pfDNviUMzlsJ3q679UHFg6vVIqN6smbYGh1Hnr_uzHwgzvRDmosynGVbro3DeJlzpmUmmrscTMFIDHwbejIlsJ_v1BhgJ0DwBPNDiLsytFOSkhe9oPO1qhXamHDxdcXQaauiKjOjFpxoBNrU1ed1BjYCDqHwLILtmZeZFA6K7zog5|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.1970.tb02321.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They distinguish for [[Dicotyledon|dicots]]: 
* '''{{vanchor|actinocytic}}''' (meaning ''star-celled'') stomata have guard cells that are surrounded by at least five radiating cells forming a star-like circle. This is a rare type that can for instance be found in the [[Ebenaceae]] family.
* '''{{vanchor|anisocytic}}''' (meaning ''unequal celled'') stomata have guard cells between two larger subsidiary cells and one distinctly smaller one. This type of stomata can be found in more than thirty dicot families, including [[Brassicaceae]], [[Solanaceae]], and [[Crassulaceae]]. It is sometimes called ''cruciferous type''.
* '''{{vanchor|anomocytic}}''' (meaning ''irregular celled'') stomata have guard cells that are surrounded by cells that have the same size, shape and arrangement as the rest of the epidermis cells. This type of stomata can be found in more than hundred dicot families such as [[Apocynaceae]], [[Boraginaceae]], [[Chenopodiaceae]], and [[Cucurbitaceae]]. It is sometimes called ''ranunculaceous type''.
* '''{{vanchor|diacytic}}''' (meaning ''cross-celled'') stomata have guard cells surrounded by two subsidiary cells, that each encircle one end of the opening and contact each other opposite to the middle of the opening. This type of stomata can be found in more than ten dicot families such as [[Caryophyllaceae]] and [[Acanthaceae]]. It is sometimes called ''caryophyllaceous type''.
* '''{{vanchor|hemiparacytic}}''' stomata are bordered by just one subsidiary cell that differs from the surrounding epidermis cells, its length parallel to the stoma opening. This type occurs for instance in the [[Molluginaceae]] and [[Aizoaceae]].
* '''{{vanchor|paracytic}}''' (meaning ''parallel celled'') stomata have one or more subsidiary cells parallel to the opening between the guard cells. These subsidiary cells may reach beyond the guard cells or not. This type of stomata can be found in more than hundred dicot families such as [[Rubiaceae]], [[Convolvulaceae]] and [[Fabaceae]]. It is sometimes called ''rubiaceous type''.

In [[Monocotyledon|monocots]], several different types of stomata occur such as: 
* '''gramineous''' (meaning ''grass-like'') stomata have two guard cells surrounded by two lens-shaped subsidiary cells. The guard cells are narrower in the middle and bulbous on each end. This middle section is strongly thickened. The axis of the subsidiary cells are parallel stoma opening. This type can be found in monocot families including [[Poaceae]] and [[Cyperaceae]].
* '''{{vanchor|hexacytic}}''' (meaning ''six-celled'') stomata have six subsidiary cells around both guard cells, one at either end of the opening of the stoma, one adjoining each guard cell, and one between that last subsidiary cell and the standard epidermis cells. This type can be found in some monocot families.
* '''{{vanchor|tetracytic}}''' (meaning ''four-celled'') stomata have four subsidiary cells, one on either end of the opening, and one next to each guard cell. This type occurs in many monocot families, but also can be found in some dicots, such as ''[[Tilia]]'' and several [[Asclepiadaceae]].

In [[fern]]s, four different types are distinguished:
* '''{{vanchor|hypocytic}}''' stomata have two guard cells in one layer with only ordinary epidermis cells, but with two subsidiary cells on the outer surface of the epidermis, arranged parallel to the guard cells, with a pore between them, overlying the stoma opening.
* '''{{vanchor|pericytic}}''' stomata have two guard cells that are entirely encircled by one continuous subsidiary cell (like a donut).
* '''{{vanchor|desmocytic}}''' stomata have two guard cells that are entirely encircled by one subsidiary cell that has not merged its ends (like a sausage).
* '''{{vanchor|polocytic}}''' stomata have two guard cells that are largely encircled by one subsidiary cell, but also contact ordinary epidermis cells (like a U or horseshoe).

== Stomatal crypts ==
Stomatal crypts are sunken areas of the leaf epidermis which form a chamber-like structure that contains one or more stomata and sometimes [[trichome]]s or accumulations of [[epicuticular wax|wax]]. Stomatal crypts can be an adaption to drought and dry climate conditions when the stomatal crypts are very pronounced. However, dry climates are not the only places where they can be found. The following plants are examples of species with stomatal crypts or antechambers: [[Nerium|''Nerium oleander'']], conifers, and ''[[Drimys winteri]]'' which is a species of plant found in the [[cloud forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Roth-Nebelsick, A.|author2=Hassiotou, F.|author3=Veneklaas, E. J|year=2009|title=Stomatal crypts have small effects on transpiration: A numerical model analysis. |journal=Plant Physiology|volume=151|pages=2018–2027|doi=10.1104/pp.109.146969|pmc=2785996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stomata as pathogenic pathways==
Stomata are obvious holes in the leaf by which, as was presumed for a while, pathogens can enter unchallenged. However, it has been recently shown that stomata do in fact sense the presence of some, if not all, pathogens. However, with the virulent bacteria applied to [[Arabidopsis thaliana|''Arabidopsis'']] plant leaves in the experiment, the bacteria released the chemical [[coronatine]], which forced the stomata open again within a few hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Stomata and climate change==
===Response of stomata to environmental factors===
[[Photosynthesis]], plant water transport ([[xylem]]) and gas exchange are regulated by stomatal function which is important in the functioning of plants.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rico | first1 = C | last2 = Pittermann | first2 = J | last3 = Polley | first3 = HW | last4 = Aspinwall | first4 = MJ | last5 = Fay | first5 = PA | year = 2013 | title = The effect of subambient to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration on vascular function in Helianthus annuus: implications for plant response to climate change | url = | journal = New Phytologist | volume = 199 | issue = | pages = 956–965 | doi=10.1111/nph.12339}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stomatal density]] and aperture (length of stomata) varies under a number of environmental factors such as atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration, light intensity, air temperature and photoperiod (daytime duration).
&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buckley | first1 = TN | last2 = Mott | first2 = KA | year = 2013 | title = Modelling stomatal conductance in response to environmental factors | url = | journal = Plant, Cell and Environment | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 1691–1699 | doi=10.1111/pce.12140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rogiers | first1 = SY | last2 = Hardie | first2 = WJ | last3 = Smith | first3 = JP | year = 2011 | title = Stomatal density of grapevine leaves (Vitis Vinifera L.) responds to soil temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide | url = | journal = Australian Journal of Grape and Wine Research | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 147–152 | doi=10.1111/j.1755-0238.2011.00124.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decreasing stomatal density is one way plants have responded to the increase in concentration of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;atm&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ceccarelli | first1 = S | last2 = Grando | first2 = S | last3 = Maatougui | first3 = M | last4 = Michael | first4 = M | last5 = Slash | first5 = M | last6 = Haghparast | first6 = R | last7 = Rahmanian | first7 = M | last8 = Taheri | first8 = A | last9 = Al-Yassin | first9 = A | last10 = Benbelkacem | first10 = A | last11 = Labdi | first11 = M | last12 = Mimoun | first12 = H | last13 = Nachit | first13 = M | year = 2010 | title = 'Plant breeding and climate changes' | url = | journal = The Journal of Agricultural Science | volume = 148 | issue = 6| pages = 627–637 | doi=10.1017/s0021859610000651}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although changes in [CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;atm&lt;/sub&gt; response is the least understood mechanistically, this stomatal response has begun to plateau where it is soon expected to impact [[transpiration]] and [[photosynthesis]] processes in plants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Serna | first1 = L | last2 = Fenoll | first2 = C | year = 2000 | title = Coping with human CO2 emissions | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 408 | issue = | pages = 656–657 | doi=10.1038/35047202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future adaptations during climate change===
It is expected for [CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;atm&lt;/sub&gt; to reach 500–1000 ppm by 2100.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 96% of the past 400 000 years experienced below 280 ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels. From this figure, it is highly probable that [[genotype]]s of today’s plants diverged from their pre-industrial relative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The gene ''HIC'' (high carbon dioxide) encodes a negative regulator for the development of stomata in plants.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gray | first1 = J | last2 = Holroyd | first2 = G | last3 = van der Lee | first3 = F | last4 = Bahrami | first4 = A | last5 = Sijmons | first5 = P | last6 = Woodward | first6 = F | last7 = Schuch | first7 = W | last8 = Hetherington | first8 = A | year = 2000 | title = The ''HIC'' signalling pathway links CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; perception to stomatal development | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 408 | issue = | pages = 713–716 | bibcode = 2000Natur.408..713G | doi = 10.1038/35047071 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research into the ''HIC'' gene using'' [[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' found no increase of stomatal development in the dominant [[allele]], but in the ‘wild type’ [[recessive allele]] showed a large increase, both in response to rising CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These studies imply the plants response to changing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels is largely controlled by genetics.

===Agricultural implications===
In the face of ecological contingencies such as increasing temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns, long term [[climate change]], and [[wikt:biotic|biotic]] influences of human management interventions, it{{what|date=February 2018}} is expected to reduce the production and quality of food and have a negative impact on agricultural production.{{dubious|date=February 2018}}{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The CO&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;fertiliser effect has been greatly overestimated during [[Free-air concentration enrichment|Free-Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment]] (FACE) experiments where results show increased CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels in the atmosphere enhances photosynthesis, reduce transpiration, and increase [[Water-use efficiency|water use efficiency]] (WUE).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Increased [[biomass]] is one of the effects with simulations from experiments predicting a 5–20% increase in crop yields at 550 ppm of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tubiello | first1 = FN | last2 = Soussana | first2 = J-F | last3 = Howden | first3 = SM | year = 2007 | title = Crop and pasture response to climate change | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 50| pages = 19686–19690 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0701728104| bibcode = 2007PNAS..10419686T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of leaf photosynthesis were shown to increase by 30–50% in [[C3 carbon fixation|C3]] plants, and 10–25% in [[C4 carbon fixation|C4]] under doubled CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The existence of a [[feedback mechanism]] results a [[phenotypic plasticity]] in response to [CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;atm&lt;/sub&gt; that may have been an adaptive trait in the evolution of plant respiration and function.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Predicting how stomata perform during adaptation is useful for understanding the productivity of plant systems for both natural and [[agricultural systems]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Plant breeders and farmers are beginning to work together using evolutionary and participatory plant breeding to find the best suited species such as heat and drought resistant crop varieties that could naturally evolve to the change in the face of food security challenges.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a particular type of [[computer architecture]] where every [[Word (data type)|word]] of memory constitutes a [[tagged union]], being divided into a number of bits of data, and a ''tag'' section that describes the type of the data: how it is to be interpreted, and, if it is a reference, the type of the object that it points to.

Two notable series of American tagged architectures were the [[Lisp machine]]s, which had [[tagged pointer]] support at the hardware and [[opcode]] level, and the [[Burroughs large systems]], which had  a data-driven tagged and descriptor-based architecture.  Another "exemplary" instance was the architecture of the [[Rice Institute Computer|Rice Computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~adam/R1/r1rpt.html |title=A Brief History of the Rice Computer 1959-1971 |last=Thornton |first=Adam |accessdate=January 31, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224035658/http://www.princeton.edu/~adam/R1/r1rpt.html |archivedate=February 24, 2008 }} (mostly written in [or before] 1994, and archived by the [[Wayback Machine]] on a date indicated [by "20080224"] in the URL)&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Burroughs and Lisp machine were examples of [[high-level language computer architecture]]s, where the tagging was used to support types from a [[high-level language]] at the hardware level.

In addition to this, the original [[Smalltalk|Xerox Smalltalk]] implementation used the least-significant bit of each 16-bit word as a tag bit: if it was clear then the hardware would accept it as an [[Memory alignment|aligned]] memory address while if it was set it was treated as a (shifted) 15-bit integer. Current Intel documentation mentions that the lower bits of a memory address might be similarly used by some interpreter-based systems.

In the Soviet Union, the [[Elbrus_(computer)|Elbrus]] series of supercomputers pioneered the use of tagged architectures in 1973.

'''Telecommunications engineering''' is an [[engineering]] discipline centered on [[Electrical engineering|electrical]] and [[computer engineering]] which seeks to support and enhance [[telecommunication]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jee.org/2001/october/417.pdf |title=The First Telecommunications Engineering Program in the United States |author=Burnham, Gerald O.|journal=[[Journal of Engineering Education]] |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=653–657 |date=October 2001 |publisher=[[American Society for Engineering Education]] |accessdate={{Format date|2012|09|22}}|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abet.org/uploadedFiles/Accreditation/Accreditation_Process/Accreditation_Documents/Current/tac-criteria-2012-2013.pdf |title=Program criteria for telecommunications engineering technology or similarly named programs |work=Criteria for accrediting engineering technology programs 2012-2013 |page=23 |date=October 2011 |publisher=[[ABET]] |accessdate={{Format date|2012|09|22}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work ranges from basic [[circuit design]] to strategic mass developments. A telecommunication engineer is responsible for designing and overseeing the installation of telecommunications equipment and facilities, such as complex [[electronic switching system]]s, and other [[plain old telephone service]] facilities, [[optical fiber]] cabling, [[IP network]]s, and [[microwave transmission]] systems. Telecommunication engineering also overlaps with [[broadcast engineering]].

Telecommunication is a diverse field of engineering connected to [[Electronic engineering|electronic]], [[civil engineering|civil]] and [[systems engineering]]. Ultimately, telecom engineers are responsible for providing high-speed [[data transmission]] services. They use a variety of equipment and transport media to design the telecom network infrastructure; the most common media used by wired telecommunications today are [[twisted pair]], [[coaxial cable]]s, and [[optical fiber]]s. Telecommunications engineers also provide solutions revolving around [[wireless]] modes of communication and information transfer, such as wireless telephony services, radio and [[satellite communications]], and [[internet]] and [[broadband]] technologies.

==History==
Telecommunication systems are generally designed by telecommunication engineers which sprang from technological improvements in the telegraph industry in the late 19th century and the radio and the telephone industries in the early 20th century. Today, telecommunication is widespread and devices that assist the process, such as the television, radio and telephone, are common in many parts of the world. There are also many networks that connect these devices, including computer networks, [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN),{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} radio networks, and television networks. Computer communication across the Internet is one of many examples of telecommunication.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Telecommunication plays a vital role in the world economy, and the telecommunication industry's revenue has been placed at just under 3% of the gross world product.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

=== Telegraph and telephone ===
{{Main|Electrical telegraph|Transatlantic telegraph cable|Invention of the telephone|History of the telephone}}
[[File:Alexander Graham Bell's big box telephone, 1876, one of the first commercially available telephones - National Museum of American History - DSC06223.JPG|thumb|Alexander Graham Bell's big box telephone, 1876, one of the first commercially available telephones - National Museum of American History]]

[[Samuel Morse]] independently developed a version of the electrical telegraph that he unsuccessfully demonstrated on 2 September 1837. Soon after he was joined by [[Alfred Vail]] who developed the register &amp;mdash; a telegraph terminal that integrated a logging device for recording messages to paper tape. This was demonstrated successfully over three miles (five kilometres) on 6 January 1838 and eventually over forty miles (sixty-four kilometres) between [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Baltimore]] on 24 May 1844. The patented invention proved lucrative and by 1851 telegraph lines in the [[United States]] spanned over 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometres).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/tel/morse/morse.htm The Electromagnetic Telegraph], J. B. Calvert, April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first successful [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] was completed on 27 July 1866, allowing transatlantic telecommunication for the first time. Earlier transatlantic cables installed in 1857 and 1858 only operated for a few days or weeks before they failed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/hst/atlantic-cable/ The Atlantic Cable], Bern Dibner, Burndy Library Inc., 1959&lt;/ref&gt; The international use of the telegraph has sometimes been dubbed the "[[Victorian Internet]]".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Redfern, ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4475394.stm Wiring up the 'Victorian internet']'', [[BBC News]], 29 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercial telephone services were set up in 1878 and 1879 on both sides of the Atlantic in the cities of [[New Haven]] and [[London]]. [[Alexander Graham Bell]] held the master patent for the telephone that was needed for such services in both countries. The technology grew quickly from this point, with inter-city lines being built and [[telephone exchange]]s in every major city of the United States by the mid-1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connected-earth.com/Galleries/Telecommunicationsage/Thetelephone/index.htm Connected Earth: The telephone], BT, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.att.com/history/milestones.html History of AT&amp;T], AT&amp;T, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Page |first=Arthur W. |authorlink= |date=January 1906 |title=Communication By Wire And "Wireless": The Wonders of Telegraph and Telephone |journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]] |volume=XIII |issue= |pages=8408–8422 |id= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3IfNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA8408|accessdate=2009-07-10 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, transatlantic voice communication remained impossible for customers until January 7, 1927 when a connection was established using radio. However no cable connection existed until [[TAT-1]] was inaugurated on September 25, 1956 providing 36 telephone circuits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Cables/CableTimeLine/index1951.htm History of the Atlantic Cable &amp; Submarine Telegraphy], Bill Glover, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, Bell and co-inventor [[Charles Sumner Tainter]] conducted the world's first wireless telephone call via modulated lightbeams projected by [[photophone]]s. The scientific principles of their invention would not be utilized for several decades, when they were first deployed in military and [[fiber-optic communication]]s.

=== Radio and television ===
[[File:Marconi crystal radio receiver.jpg|thumb|[[Marconi]] crystal radio receiver]]
{{Main|History of radio|History of television}}

Over several years starting in 1894 the Italian inventor [[Guglielmo Marconi]] built the first complete, commercially successful wireless telegraphy system based on airborne electromagnetic waves ([[radio transmission]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klooster|first=John W.|title=Icons of invention: the makers of the modern world from Gutenberg to Gates|publisher=ABC-CLIO|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKuG-VIwID8C&amp;pg=PA161|pages=161–168|date=2009|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1901, he would go on to established wireless communication between Britain and Newfoundland, earning him the [[Nobel Prize in physics]] in 1909 (which he shared with [[Karl Ferdinand Braun|Karl Braun]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teslasociety.com/biography.htm Tesla Biography], Ljubo Vujovic, Tesla Memorial Society of New York, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900 [[Karl Ferdinand Braun|Reginald Fessenden]] was able to wirelessly transmit a human voice. On March 25, 1925, Scottish inventor [[John Logie Baird]] publicly demonstrated the transmission of moving silhouette pictures at the London department store [[Selfridges]].  In October 1925, Baird was successful in obtaining moving pictures with [[halftone]] shades, which were by most accounts the first true television pictures.&lt;ref name="The Baird Television Website"&gt;[http://www.bairdtelevision.com The Baird Television Website]&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to a public demonstration of the improved device on 26 January 1926 again at [[Selfridges]]. Baird's first devices relied upon the [[Nipkow disk]] and thus became known as the [[mechanical television]]. It formed the basis of semi-experimental broadcasts done by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] beginning September 30, 1929.

=== Satellite ===
{{Main|Communications satellite|Satellite phone|Satellite radio|Satellite television|Satellite Internet access}}
The first U.S. satellite to relay communications was [[Project SCORE]] in 1958, which used a tape recorder to [[store and forward]] voice messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. In 1960 [[NASA]] launched an [[Echo satellite]]; the {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} aluminized [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] balloon served as a passive reflector for radio communications.  [[Courier 1B]], built by [[Philco]], also launched in 1960, was the world's first active repeater satellite. Satellites these days are used for many applications such as uses in GPS, television, internet and telephone uses.

[[Telstar]] was the first active, direct relay commercial [[communications satellite]]. Belonging to [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company|AT&amp;T]] as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&amp;T, [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]], NASA, the British [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Post Office]], and the [[Orange S.A.|French National PTT]] (Post Office) to develop satellite communications, it was launched by NASA from [[Cape Canaveral]] on July 10, 1962, the first privately sponsored space launch. [[Relay 1]] was launched on December 13, 1962, and became the first satellite to broadcast across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] on November 22, 1963.&lt;ref name="NASA-SP-93"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660009169_1966009169.pdf|title=Significant Achievements in Space Communications and Navigation, 1958-1964|year=1966|work=NASA-SP-93|publisher=NASA|pages=30–32|accessdate=2009-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental [[long distance telephony]]. The fixed [[Public Switched Telephone Network]] relays [[telephone call]]s from [[land line]] telephones to an [[earth station]], where they are then transmitted a receiving [[satellite dish]] via a [[geostationary satellite]] in Earth orbit.  Improvements in [[submarine communications cable]]s, through the use of [[fiber-optics]], caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they still exclusively service remote islands such as [[Ascension Island]], [[Saint Helena]], [[Diego Garcia]], and [[Easter Island]], where no submarine cables are in service. There are also some continents and some regions of countries where landline telecommunications are rare to nonexistent, for example [[Antarctica]], plus large regions of [[Australia]], [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Northern Canada]], [[China]], [[Russia]] and [[Greenland]].

After commercial long distance telephone service was established via communication satellites, a host of other commercial telecommunications were also adapted to similar satellites starting in 1979, including [[satellite phone|mobile satellite phones]], [[satellite radio]], [[satellite television]] and [[satellite Internet access]]. The earliest adaption for most such services occurred in the 1990s as the pricing for commercial [[Transponder (satellite communications)|satellite transponder channels]] continued to drop significantly.

=== Computer networks and the Internet ===
{{main|Computer networking|History of the Internet}}
[[File:Arpanet 1974.svg|thumb|Symbolic representation of the Arpanet as of September 1974]]

On 11 September 1940, [[George Stibitz]] was able to transmit problems using [[teleprinter]] to his Complex Number Calculator in New York and receive the computed results back at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kerryr.net/pioneers/stibitz.htm George Stlibetz], Kerry Redshaw, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This configuration of a centralized computer or [[mainframe computer]] with remote "dumb terminals" remained popular throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s. However, it was not until the 1960s that researchers started to investigate [[packet switching]] — a technology that allows chunks of data to be sent between different computers without first passing through a centralized mainframe. A four-node network emerged on 5 December 1969. This network soon became the [[ARPANET]], which by 1981 would consist of 213 nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hafner | first = Katie | title = Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-684-83267-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARPANET's development centered around the Request for Comment process and on 7 April 1969, RFC 1 was published. This process is important because ARPANET would eventually merge with other networks to form the Internet, and many of the [[communication protocol]]s that the Internet relies upon today were specified through the Request for Comment process. In September 1981, RFC 791 introduced the [[Internet Protocol]] version 4 (IPv4) and RFC 793 introduced the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) — thus creating the TCP/IP protocol that much of the Internet relies upon today.

===Optical fiber===
{{main |Fiber-optic communication}}
[[File:U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Gary Chitwood, a tactical automated security system (TASS) administrator with the 380th Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron, tests a fiber optic wire 130320-F-ME639-036.jpg|thumb|[[Optical fiber]]]]

Optical fiber can be used as a medium for telecommunication and [[computer network]]ing because it is flexible and can be bundled into cables. It is especially advantageous for long-distance communications, because light propagates through the fiber with little attenuation compared to electrical cables. This allows long distances to be spanned with few [[optical communications repeater|repeater]]s.

In 1966 [[Charles K. Kao]] and [[George Hockham]] proposed optical fibers at STC Laboratories (STL) at [[Harlow]], England, when they showed that the losses of 1000&amp;nbsp;dB/km in existing glass (compared to 5-10&amp;nbsp;dB/km in coaxial cable) was due to contaminants, which could potentially be removed.

Optical fiber was successfully developed in 1970 by [[Corning Glass Works]], with attenuation low enough for communication purposes (about 20[[Decibel|dB]]/km), and at the same time GaAs (Gallium arsenide) [[Laser diode|semiconductor lasers]] were developed that were compact and therefore suitable for transmitting light through fiber optic cables for long distances.

After a period of research starting from 1975, the first commercial fiber-optic communications system was developed, which operated at a wavelength around 0.8&amp;nbsp;µm and used GaAs semiconductor lasers. This first-generation system operated at a bit rate of 45&amp;nbsp;[[Mbps]] with repeater spacing of up to 10&amp;nbsp;km. Soon on 22 April 1977, General Telephone and Electronics sent the first live telephone traffic through fiber optics at a 6 Mbit/s throughput in Long Beach, California.

The first wide area network fibre optic cable system in the world seems to have been installed by Rediffusion in Hastings, East Sussex, UK in 1978. The cables were placed in ducting throughout the town, and had over 1000 subscribers. They were used at that time for the transmission of television channels,not available because of local reception problems.

The first [[transatlantic telephone cable]] to use optical fiber was [[TAT-8]], based on Desurvire optimized laser amplification technology. It went into operation in 1988.

In the late 1990s through 2000, industry promoters, and research companies such as KMI, and RHK predicted massive increases in demand for communications bandwidth due to increased use of the [[Internet]], and commercialization of various bandwidth-intensive consumer services, such as [[video on demand]]. [[Internet protocol]] data traffic was increasing exponentially, at a faster rate than integrated circuit complexity had increased under [[Moore's Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hellman |first=Martin E. |title=Moore's Law and Communications |url=http://www-ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/opinion/moore.html |date=11 June 2003 |accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts==
[[File:Radio Transmitter room.jpg|thumb|upright|Radio [[transmitter]] room]]

===Basic elements of a telecommunication system===
{{Main|Telecommunication}}

====Transmitter====
{{Main|Transmitter}}
[[Transmitter]] (information source) that takes information and converts it to a signal for transmission. In [[electronics]] and [[telecommunications]] a transmitter or radio transmitter is an [[electronic device]] which, with the aid of an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]], produces [[radio wave]]s. In addition to their use in [[broadcasting]], transmitters are necessary component parts of many electronic devices that communicate by [[radio communication|radio]], such as [[cell phone]]s, 
[[File: Lautsprecherkabel Makro nah.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Copper]] wires]]

====Transmission medium====
{{Main|Transmission medium}}
[[Transmission medium]] over which the signal is transmitted. For example, the transmission medium for [[sound]]s is usually air, but solids and liquids may also act as transmission media for sound. Many transmission media are used as [[communications channel]]. One of the most common physical medias used in networking is [[Copper wire and cable|copper wire]]. Copper wire to carry signals to long distances using relatively low amounts of power.Another example of a physical medium is [[optical fiber]], which has emerged as the most commonly used transmission medium for long-distance communications. Optical fiber is a thin strand of glass that guides light along its length.

The absence of a material medium in [[vacuum]] may also constitute a transmission medium for [[electromagnetic wave]]s such as [[light]] and [[radio wave]]s.

====Receiver====
{{Main|Receiver (radio)}}
[[Receiver (radio)|Receiver]] ([[information sink]]) that receives and converts the signal back into required information. In [[radio communications]], a radio receiver is an electronic device that receives [[radio wave]]s and converts the information carried by them to a usable form. It is used with an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. The information produced by the receiver may be in the form of sound (an [[audio signal]]), images (a [[video signal]]) or [[digital data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/rf-technology-design/index.php |title=Radio Frequency, RF, Technology and Design, ''Radio Receiver Technology'' |website=Radio-Electronics.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127132225/http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/rf-technology-design/index.php |archivedate=27 January 2012 |accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wireless communication tower.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Wireless]] communication tower, [[cell site]]]]

===Wired communication===
{{Main|Wired communication}}
Wired communications make use of underground communications cables (less often, overhead lines), electronic signal amplifiers (repeaters) inserted into connecting cables at specified points, and terminal apparatus of various types, depending on the type of wired communications used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Wired+Communications |title=The Great Soviet Encyclopedia |edition=3rd |chapter=Wired Communications |publisher=The Gale Group, Inc.|date=1979 |origyear=First published 1970 |accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wireless communication===
{{Main|Wireless}}
Wireless communication involves the transmission of information over a distance without help of wires, cables or any other forms of electrical conductors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineersgarage.com/articles/wireless_communication |title=What is wireless communication technology and its types |website=EngineersGarage |accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wireless operations permit services, such as long-range communications, that are impossible or impractical to implement with the use of wires. The term is commonly used in the [[telecommunications]] industry to refer to telecommunications systems (e.g. radio transmitters and receivers, remote controls etc.) which use some form of energy (e.g. [[radio waves]], acoustic energy, etc.) to transfer information without the use of wires.&lt;ref name="FS1037C"&gt;{{cite web|title=ATIS Telecom Glossary 2007 |url=http://www.atis.org/tg2k/ |publisher=atis.org |accessdate=2008-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302071329/http://www.atis.org/tg2k/ |archivedate=2008-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Information is transferred in this manner over both short and long distances.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Roles==

===Telecom equipment engineer===
A telecom equipment engineer is an electronics engineer that designs equipment such as routers, switches, multiplexers, and other specialized computer/electronics equipment designed to be used in the telecommunication network infrastructure.

===Network engineer===
A network engineer is a computer engineer who is in charge of designing, deploying and maintaining computer networks. In addition, they oversee network operations from a [[network operations center]], designs [[backbone network|backbone]] infrastructure, or supervises interconnections in a [[data center]].

===Central-office engineer===
[[File:Typical Northern Telecom DMS100 Telephone Central Office Installation.jpg|thumb|Typical Northern Telecom DMS100 Telephone [[Telephone exchange|Central Office]] Installation]]
A central-office engineer is responsible for designing and overseeing the implementation of telecommunications equipment in a [[Telephone exchange|central office]] (CO for short), also referred to as a wire center or [[telephone exchange]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Overstreet |first=Frank |url=http://www.frankoverstreet.com/pages/co/what-is-a-central-office.aspx |title=What is a Central Office |website=www.frankoverstreet.com |accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A CO engineer is responsible for integrating new technology into the existing network, assigning the equipment's location in the wire center, and providing power, clocking (for digital equipment), and alarm monitoring facilities for the new equipment. The CO engineer is also responsible for providing more power, clocking, and alarm monitoring facilities if there are currently not enough available to support the new equipment being installed. Finally, the CO engineer is responsible for designing how the massive amounts of cable will be distributed to various equipment and wiring frames throughout the wire center and overseeing the installation and turn up of all new equipment.

====Sub-roles====
As [[structural engineer]]s, CO engineers are responsible for the structural design and placement of racking and bays for the equipment to be installed in as well as for the plant to be placed on.

As [[electrical engineer]]s, CO engineers are responsible for the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], [[capacitance]], and [[inductance]] (RCL) design of all new plant to ensure telephone service is clear and crisp and data service is clean as well as reliable. [[Attenuation]] or gradual loss in intensity{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} and loop loss calculations are required to determine cable length and size required to provide the service called for. In addition, power requirements have to be calculated and provided to power any electronic equipment being placed in the wire center.

Overall, CO engineers have seen new challenges emerging in the CO environment. With the advent of Data Centers, [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) facilities, cellular radio sites, and other emerging-technology equipment environments within telecommunication networks, it is important that a consistent set of established practices or requirements be implemented.

Installation suppliers or their sub-contractors are expected to provide requirements with their products, features, or services. These services might be associated with the installation of new or expanded equipment, as well as the removal of existing equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-1275&amp; GR-1275, ''Central Office/Network Environment Equipment Installation/Removal Generic Requirements,''] Telcordia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-1502&amp; GR-1502, ''Central Office/Network Environment Detail Engineering Generic Requirements,''] Telcordia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other factors must be considered such as:
*Regulations and safety in installation
*Removal of hazardous material
*Commonly used tools to perform installation and removal of equipment

===Outside-plant engineer===
[[File:VZ SAI workers Secaucus jeh.JPG|thumb|Engineers working on a [[cross-connect]] box, also known as a [[serving area interface]]]]
[[Outside plant]] (OSP) engineers are also often called field engineers because they frequently spend much time in the field taking notes about the civil environment, aerial, above ground, and below ground.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} OSP engineers are responsible for taking plant (copper, fiber, etc.) from a wire center to a distribution point or destination point directly. If a distribution point design is used, then a [[cross-connect]] box is placed in a strategic location to feed a determined distribution area.

The [[cross-connect]] box, also known as a [[serving area interface]], is then installed to allow connections to be made more easily from the wire center to the destination point and ties up fewer facilities by not having dedication facilities from the wire center to every destination point.  The plant is then taken directly to its destination point or to another small closure called a terminal, where access can also be gained to the plant if necessary.  These access points are preferred as they allow faster repair times for customers and save telephone operating companies large amounts of money.

The plant facilities can be delivered via underground facilities, either direct buried or through conduit or in some cases laid under water, via aerial facilities such as telephone or power poles, or via microwave radio signals for long distances where either of the other two methods is too costly.

====Sub-roles====
[[File:Lady pole climbing Telephone Engineer - geograph.org.uk - 467324.jpg|thumb|Engineer (OSP) climbing a telephone pole]]
As [[structural engineers]], OSP engineers are responsible for the structural design and placement of cellular towers and telephone poles as well as calculating pole capabilities of existing telephone or power poles onto which new plant is being added.  Structural calculations are required when boring under heavy traffic areas such as highways or when attaching to other structures such as bridges. Shoring also has to be taken into consideration for larger trenches or pits.  Conduit structures often include encasements of slurry that needs to be designed to support the structure and withstand the environment around it (soil type, high traffic areas, etc.).

As [[electrical engineers]], OSP engineers are responsible for the resistance, capacitance, and inductance (RCL) design of all new plant to ensure telephone service is clear and crisp and data service is clean as well as reliable.  [[Attenuation]] or gradual loss in intensity{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} and loop loss calculations are required to determine cable length and size required to provide the service called for.  In addition power requirements have to be calculated and provided to power any electronic equipment being placed in the field.  Ground potential has to be taken into consideration when placing equipment, facilities, and plant in the field to account for lightning strikes, high voltage intercept from improperly grounded or broken power company facilities, and from various sources of electromagnetic interference.

As [[civil engineer]]s, OSP engineers are responsible for drafting plans, either by hand or using [[Computer-aided design]] (CAD) software, for how telecom plant facilities will be placed.  Often when working with municipalities trenching or boring permits are required and drawings must be made for these.  Often these drawings include about 70% or so of the detailed information required to pave a road or add a turn lane to an existing street.  Structural calculations are required when boring under heavy traffic areas such as highways or when attaching to other structures such as bridges.  As civil engineers, telecom engineers provide the modern communications backbone for all technological communications distributed throughout civilizations today.

Unique to telecom engineering is the use of air-core cable which requires an extensive network of air handling equipment such as compressors, manifolds, regulators and hundreds of miles of air pipe per system that connects to pressurized splice cases all designed to pressurize this special form of copper cable to keep moisture out and provide a clean signal to the customer.

As political and social [[ambassador]], the OSP engineer is a telephone operating company's face and voice to the local authorities and other utilities. OSP engineers often meet with municipalities, construction companies and other utility companies to address their concerns and educate them about how the telephone utility works and operates.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Additionally, the OSP engineer has to secure real estate to place outside facilities on, such as an easement to place a cross-connect box on.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8610">In [[Astrophysics|astrophysic]]s, the '''virial mass''' is the mass of a gravitationally bound astrophysical system, assuming the [[virial theorem]] applies. In the context of [[Galaxy formation and evolution|galaxy formation]] and [[dark matter halo]]s, the virial mass is defined as the mass enclosed within the [[virial radius]] &lt;math&gt;r_{\rm vir}&lt;/math&gt; of a gravitationally bound system, a radius within which the system obeys the [[virial theorem]]. The virial radius is determined using a "top-hat" model. A spherical "top hat" density perturbation destined to become a galaxy begins to expand, but the expansion is halted and reversed due to the mass collapsing under gravity until the sphere reaches virial equilibrium–it is said to be ''virialized''. Within this radius, the sphere obeys the virial theorem which says that the average kinetic energy is equal to minus one half times the average potential energy, &lt;math&gt;\langle T \rangle = -\frac{1}{2} \langle V \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, and this radius defines the virial radius.

== Virial radius ==

The virial radius of a gravitationally bound astrophysical system is the radius within which the virial theorem applies. It is defined as the radius at which the density is equal to the critical density &lt;math&gt;\rho_c&lt;/math&gt; of the Universe at the redshift of the system, multiplied by an overdensity constant &lt;math&gt;\Delta_c&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;\rho(&lt;r_{\rm vir}) = \Delta_c \rho_c(t)=\Delta_{c}\frac{3 H^2(t)}{8 \pi G},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho(&lt;r_{\rm vir})&lt;/math&gt; is the halo's mean density within that radius, &lt;math&gt;\Delta_c&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, &lt;math&gt;\rho_{c}(t) = \frac{3 H^2(t)}{8 \pi G}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]] of the Universe, &lt;math&gt;H^2(t)=H_0^2[\Omega_r(1+z)^4+\Omega_m(1+z)^3+(1-\Omega_{tot})(1+z)^2+\Omega_{\Lambda}]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hubble parameter]], and &lt;math&gt;r_{\rm vir}&lt;/math&gt; is the virial radius.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Galaxies and the Universe|last=Sparke|first=Linda S.|last2=Gallagher|first2=John S.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-521-67186-6|location=United States of America|pages=329, 331, 362}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=M|date=3 February 2001|title=The mass of a halo|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=367|issue=1|pages=27–32|arxiv=astro-ph/0011495|bibcode=2001A&amp;A...367...27W|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20000357|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time dependence of the Hubble parameter indicates that the [[redshift]] of the system is important, as the Hubble parameter changes with time: today's Hubble parameter, referred to as the [[Hubble's law|Hubble Constant]] &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt;, is not the same as the Hubble parameter at an earlier time in the Universe's history, or in other words, at a different redshift. The overdensity &lt;math&gt;\Delta_c&lt;/math&gt; is given by
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\Delta_c=18\pi^2+82x-39x^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x=\Omega(z)-1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Omega(z)=\frac{\Omega_0(1+z)^3}{E(z)^2},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\Omega_0=\frac{8 \pi G \rho_0}{3 H_0^2},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E(z)=\frac{H(z)}{H_0}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bryan|first=Greg L.|last2=Norman|first2=Michael L.|date=10 Oct 1997|title=Statistical Properties of X-ray Clusters: Analytic and Numerical Comparisons|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=495|issue=80|pages=80|arxiv=astro-ph/9710107|doi=10.1086/305262|bibcode=1998ApJ...495...80B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Galaxy Formation and Evolution|last=Mo|first=Houjun|last2=van den Bosch|first2=Frank|last3=White|first3=Simon|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-521-85793-2|location=United States of America|pages=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it depends on the [[density parameter]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, its value depends on the cosmological model used. In an [[Einstein-de sitter cosmological model|Einstein-de Sitter model]] it equals &lt;math&gt;18\pi^2\approx 178&lt;/math&gt;. This definition is not universal, however, as the exact value of &lt;math&gt;\Delta_c&lt;/math&gt; depends on the cosmology. In an Einstein-de Sitter model, it is assumed that the density parameter is due to matter only, where &lt;math&gt;\Omega_m=1&lt;/math&gt;. Compare this to the currently accepted cosmological model for the Universe, [[ΛCDM]] model, where &lt;math&gt;\Omega_m=0.3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.7&lt;/math&gt;; in this case, &lt;math&gt;\Delta_c\approx100&lt;/math&gt;. Nevertheless it is typically assumed that &lt;math&gt;\Delta_c = 200&lt;/math&gt; for the purpose of using a common definition, and this is denoted as &lt;math&gt;r_{200}&lt;/math&gt; for the virial radius and &lt;math&gt;M_{200}&lt;/math&gt; for the virial mass. Using this convention, the mean density is given by
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\rho(&lt;r_{200}) = 200  \rho_c(t)=200\frac{3 H^2(t)}{8 \pi G}.&lt;/math&gt;

Other conventions for the overdensity constant include &lt;math&gt;\Delta_c = 500&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\Delta_c = 1000&lt;/math&gt;, depending on the type of analysis being done, in which case the virial radius and virial mass is signified by the relevant subscript.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Defining the virial mass ==

Given the virial radius and the overdensity convention, the virial mass &lt;math&gt;M_{\rm vir}&lt;/math&gt; can be found through the relation

&lt;math display="block"&gt;M_{\rm vir}=\frac{4}{3}\pi r_{\rm vir}^3 \rho(&lt;r_{\rm vir})=\frac{4}{3}\pi r_{\rm vir}^3 \Delta_c \rho_{c}.&lt;/math&gt;If the convention that &lt;math&gt;\Delta_c = 200&lt;/math&gt; is used, then this becomes&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;math display="block"&gt;M_{200}=\frac{4}{3}\pi r_{200}^3 200 \rho_{c}=\frac{100 r_{200}^3 H^2(t)}{G},&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;H(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the Hubble parameter as described above, and G is the [[gravitational constant]]. This defines the virial mass of an astrophysical system.

== Applications to dark matter halos ==
Given &lt;math&gt;    M_{200}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_{200}&lt;/math&gt;, properties of dark matter halos can be defined, including circular velocity, the density profile, and total mass. &lt;math&gt;    M_{200}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_{200}&lt;/math&gt; are directly related to the [[Navarro–Frenk–White profile|Navarro-Frenk-White]] (NFW) profile, a density profile that describes dark matter halos modeled with the [[Cold dark matter|Cold Dark Matter]] paradigm. The NFW profile is given by&lt;math display="block"&gt;\rho(r)=\frac{\delta_c\rho_{c}}{r/r_s(1+r/r_s)^2},&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;\rho_c&lt;/math&gt; is the critical density, and the overdensity &lt;math&gt;\delta_c=\frac{200}{3}\frac{c_{200}^3}{\ln(1+c_{200})-\frac{c_{200}}{1+c_{200}}}&lt;/math&gt; (not to be confused with &lt;math&gt;\Delta_c&lt;/math&gt;) and the scale radius &lt;math&gt;r_s&lt;/math&gt; are unique to each halo, and the concentration parameter is given by &lt;math&gt;c_{200}=\frac{r_{200}}{r_s}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Navarro|first=Julio F.|last2=Frenk|first2=Carlos S.|last3=White|first3=Simon D. M.|date=7 Aug 1995|title=The Structure of Cold Dark Matter Halos|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=462|pages=563–575|arxiv=astro-ph/9508025|doi=10.1086/177173|bibcode=1996ApJ...462..563N}}&lt;/ref&gt; In place of &lt;math&gt;\delta_c\rho_{c}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho_s&lt;/math&gt; is often used, where &lt;math&gt;\rho_s&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter unique to each halo. The total mass of the dark matter halo can then be computed by integrating over the volume of the density out to the virial radius &lt;math&gt;r_{200}&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;M=\int \limits_{0}^{r_{200}}4\pi r^2\rho(r)dr=4\pi \rho_s r_s^3[\ln(\frac{r_{200}+r_s}{r_s})-\frac{r_{200}}{r_{200}+r_s}]=4\pi \rho_s r_s^3[\ln(1+c_{200})-\frac{c_{200}}{1+c_{200}}].&lt;/math&gt;

From the definition of the circular velocity, &lt;math&gt;V_c(r)=\sqrt{\frac{GM(r)}{r}},&lt;/math&gt; we can find the circular velocity at the virial radius &lt;math&gt;r_{200}&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;math display="block"&gt;V_{200}=\sqrt{\frac{GM_{200}}{r_{200}}}.&lt;/math&gt;Then the circular velocity for the dark matter halo is given by&lt;math display="block"&gt;V_c^2(r)=V_{200}^2\frac{1}{x}\frac{\ln(1+cx)-(cx)/(1+cx)}{\ln(1+c)-c/(1+c)},&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;x=r/r_{200}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Although the NFW profile is commonly used, other profiles like the [[Einasto profile]] and profiles that take into account the adiabatic contraction of the dark matter due to the baryonic content are also used to characterize dark matter halos.

To compute the total mass of the system, including stars, gas, and dark matter, the [[Jeans equations|Jeans Equations]] need to be used with density profiles for each component.
