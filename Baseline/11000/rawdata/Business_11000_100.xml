'''Alfred Beit''' (15 February 1853 – 16 July 1906) was a British gold and diamond magnate in South Africa, and a major donor and profiteer of infrastructure development on the African continent. He also donated much money to university education and research in several countries, and was the "silent partner" who structured the capital flight from post-Boer War South Africa to [[Rhodesia (region)|Rhodesia]], and the [[Rhodes Scholarship]], named after his employee, [[Cecil Rhodes]].

== Life and career ==
[[Image:Laura Beit00.jpg|thumb|left|Mrs Laura Beit (Alfred and Otto Beit's mother), by [[Leopold Graf von Kalckreuth|Leopold von Kalckreuth]]]]
Born and brought up in [[Hamburg]], [[German Confederation|Germany]], he was the eldest son and second of six children of an affluent Jewish-German citizen of Hamburg. His younger siblings included [[Otto Beit]].   Alfred Beit was an unpromising scholar and was apprenticed to [[Jules Porgès]] &amp; Cie, the Amsterdam diamond firm where he developed a talent for examining stones.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Meredith |title=Diamonds, Gold, and War: The British, the Boers, and the Making of South Africa |location=New York |publisher=PublicAffairs |year=2007 |isbn=9781586484736 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beit made his first fortune in property speculation.  Responding to a demand for business premises, he bought a piece of land and built twelve corrugated iron sheds for offices and rented eleven out monthly and kept one for himself.  Twelve years later he sold the land for a considerable profit.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Beit was sent to [[Kimberley, South Africa]] in 1875 by his firm to buy diamonds—following the diamond strike at Kimberley. He became a business friend of [[Cecil Rhodes]] through his role in the Kimberley Central Company.  Beit was captivated by Rhodes' talk of 'big schemes'.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Together, they proceeded to buy out digging ventures and to eliminate opposition such as [[Barney Barnato]]. He rapidly became one of a group of financiers who gained control of the diamond-mining claims in the Central, Dutoitspan, and [[De Beers]] mines. Rhodes was the active politician and Beit provided a lot of the planning and financial backing.

Beit's diamond interests were mainly concentrated on Kimberley mine.  He focused his main attention on the Kimberley Central Company aiming to expand its interests.  He had a major role in the rise of Kimberley Central Company.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

In 1886 Beit extended his interests to the newly discovered goldfields of the [[Witwatersrand]] and met with great success. In his business ventures there he made use of financiers [[Hermann Eckstein]] and [[Joseph Benjamin Robinson|Sir Joseph Robinson]]. He founded the Robertson Syndicate and the firm of Wernher, Beit &amp; Co. He imported mining engineers from the USA and was among the first to adopt deep-level mining. Rhodes purportedly was granted concessions by [[Lobengula]], as a result of which Beit founded the [[British South Africa Company]] in 1888.

Beit became life-governor of De Beers and also a director of numerous other companies such as Rand Mines, Rhodesia Railways and the Beira Railway Company.

In 1888 Beit moved to London when he felt he was better able to manage his financial empire and support Rhodes in his Southern African ambitions. Beit moved into Tewin Water, [[Tewin]], near [[Welwyn]], a large Regency house with Victorian additions and 7,000 acres (28&amp;nbsp;km²), and a few miles away [[Julius Wernher]] bought [[Luton Hoo]], with 5,218 acres (21.1&amp;nbsp;km²).  In the 1890s, he had a mansion built in [[Park Lane]] – [[Aldford House]].

Inspired by Rhodes' imperialist vision,{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} he took part in the planning and financing of the unsuccessful [[Jameson Raid]] of late 1895 which was intended to trigger a coup in the [[South African Republic]] in the Transvaal. As a result of this debacle, Rhodes resigned as Prime Minister, and both he and Beit were found guilty by the House of Commons inquiry. Beit was obliged to resign as director of the Charter Company, but was elected vice-president of the British South Africa Company a few years later. With the death of Rhodes in 1902, Beit, as one of the trustees, helped control the enormous estate, currently being helped by the [[Oppenheimer]] family of [[De Beers]] and [[Anglo American plc|Anglo-American]].

Beit never married and had no children. He died at Tewin Water on 16 July 1906 after seeing a rapid deterioration in his health. He left an estate of £8,049,886 (equivalent to £{{Inflation|UK-GDP|0.008049886|1906|r=2}} billion in {{Inflation-year|UK-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|UK-GDP}}).&lt;ref name="jewishtopwealth" /&gt;

== The Beit Trust and other donations ==
[[Image:ImperialCollegeLondon.jpg|thumb|Imperial College, London]]
During his lifetime, Beit made generous donations for scientific work and education. In 1905 he founded a chair of colonial history at the [[University of Oxford]], which is now the ''[[Beit Professor of Commonwealth History|Beit Professor of History of the British Commonwealth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;University of Oxford, Faculty of History. URL http://www.history.ox.ac.uk/staff/postholder/brown_jm.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906 he made the donation of two million mark to the stock capital of the ''Hamburgische Wissenschaftliche Stiftung'', a charity dedicated to spend its interest for the benefit of a precursor of the [[University of Hamburg]].

In his will he set up the [[Beit Trust]] through which he bequeathed large sums of money (£1,200,000) for infrastructure development in the former Northern and Southern Rhodesia, later modified to university education and research in [[Zimbabwe]], [[Zambia]] and [[Malawi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beittrust.org.uk|title=HOME|website=www.beittrust.org.uk|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant infrastructure projects financed by the Trust include the [[Birchenough Bridge]] in the former Southern Rhodesia, named after Sir [[Henry Birchenough]], chairman of the Beit Trust from 1931 until 1937 and whose ashes are buried beneath the structure of the bridge.&lt;ref name="heritage"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rhodesianheritage.blogspot.com/2010/02/birchenough-bridge.html|title=Our Rhodesian Heritage: Birchenough Bridge|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph Freeman (1880–1950)|Ralph Freeman]], the bridge's designer, was also the structural designer on the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] and consequently the two bridges bear a close resemblance, although Birchenough is only two-thirds as long as the Australian bridge. It was built by Dorman Long and completed in 1935.&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt; At a length of 1,080 feet (329 m) it was the third longest single-arch suspension bridge in the world at the time.

In recognition of his bequests the [[Royal School of Mines]], a faculty of [[Imperial College London]], erected a large memorial to Beit flanking the entrance to its building. The Imperial College residential halls on [[Prince Consort Road]] was named [[Beit Hall]] after him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6387">The '''Advertising Hall of Fame''', operated by the [[American Advertising Federation|American Advertising Federation (AAF)]], began in 1948 as a result of a proposal by the New York Ad Club and its president, Andrew Haire, to the Advertising Federation of America, the predecessor organization to the American Advertising Federation. The plan provided that the Advertising Hall of Fame be administered by the Advertising Federation of America on behalf of the entire advertising industry. It honors those men and women who have best served the cause of advertising. Since then, 191 extraordinary individuals have been elected to this illustrious group.

The council of judges and its executive committee are appointed each year by the president of the American Advertising Federation and chair of the Advertising Hall of Fame. These distinguished industry executives are chosen from the ranks of advertisers, agencies, media organizations and academic institutions in the United States. The council of judges considers the election of either living or deceased persons whose record of advertising and service must be accomplished in the United States or with an American company abroad. To be eligible, individuals must be retired from their primary careers.&lt;ref&gt;http://advertisinghall.org/history/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baumol's cost disease''' (or the '''Baumol effect''') is the rise of salaries in jobs that have experienced no or low increase of labor productivity, in response to rising salaries in other jobs that have experienced higher (low or no) labor productivity growth. This pattern seemingly goes against the theory in [[classical economics]] in which real wage growth is closely tied to [[labor productivity]] changes. The phenomenon was described by [[William J. Baumol]] and [[William G. Bowen]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="performing"&gt;{{cite book|title=Performing Arts, The Economic Dilemma: a study of problems common to theater, opera, music, and dance|last=Baumol|first=William J.|author2=Bowen|first2=William G.|publisher=M.I.T. Press|year=1966|isbn=0262520117|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The rise of wages in jobs without productivity gains is from the requirement to compete for employees with jobs that have experienced gains and so can naturally pay higher salaries, just as classical economics predicts. For instance, if the retail sector pays its managers 19th-century-style salaries, the managers may decide to quit to get a job at an automobile factory, where salaries are higher because of high labor productivity. Thus, managers' salaries are increased not by labor productivity increases in the retail sector but by productivity and corresponding wage increases in other industries.

The original study was conducted for the [[performing arts]] sector.&lt;ref name="performing" /&gt; Baumol and Bowen pointed out that the same number of musicians is needed to play a [[Beethoven]] [[string quartet]] today as was needed in the 19th century; the productivity of [[European classical music|classical music]] performance has not increased. On the other hand, the real wages of musicians (as in all other professions) have increased greatly since the 19th century.

In a range of businesses, such as the car manufacturing sector and other activities that involve routine tasks, workers are continually becoming more productive by technological innovations to their tools and equipment. In contrast, in some labor-intensive sectors that rely heavily on non-routine human interaction or activities, such as [[nursing]], [[education]], or the performing arts, there is little or no growth in productivity over time. As with the string quartet example, it takes nurses the same amount of time to change a bandage or college professors the same amount of time to mark an [[essay]] in 2006 as it did in 1966, as those types of activities rely on the movements of the human body, which cannot be engineered to perform more quickly, accurately, or efficiently in the same way that a machine, such as a computer, can.

Baumol's cost disease is often used to describe consequences of the lack of growth in productivity in the [[quaternary sector of the economy]] and [[public service]]s, such as public hospitals and state colleges. Since many [[public administration]] activities are heavily labor-intensive, there is little growth in productivity over time because productivity gains come essentially from a better capital technology.

==Effects, symptoms, and therapy==

Employers may react to cost increases in any number of ways including:{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

* Decrease quantity/supply
* Decrease quality
* Decrease profit margins, dividends, or investment
* Increase price
* Increase non-monetary compensation or employ volunteers
* Increase [[total factor productivity]]

In the case of education, the Baumol effect has been used as at least partial justification for the fact that in recent decades, the price of college tuition has risen faster than the general rate of inflation.&lt;ref name=surowiecki&gt;{{cite web

 | title = Debt by Degrees
 | publisher = The New Yorker
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reported productivity gains of the service industry in the late 1990s can be attributed most by total factor productivity.&lt;ref name=Bosworth&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Providers decreased the cost of ancillary labor through outsourcing or technology. Examples include offshoring data entry and bookkeeping for health care providers and replacing manually-marked essays in educational assessment with [[multiple choice]] tests that can be automatically marked (see [[Scantron]]).

The total factor productivity treatment is not available to the performing arts sector, as the consumable good is the labor itself. Instead, it has been observed that increases in price of the performing arts has been offset by increases in standard of living and entertainment spending by consumers.&lt;ref name=Heilbrun&gt;{{cite web

== Life and career ==
Bill Huang graduated from [[Huazhong University of Science &amp; Technology]] with a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. After 2 years studying at the [[University of Illinois]], he received master's degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=黄晓庆 - 中国留学人员广州科技交流会|url=https://www.ocs-gz.gov.cn/news/detail/4761|website=www.ocs-gz.gov.cn|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huang entered [[Bell Laboratories]] to work on researches in Asynchronous Transfer Mode in 1990. In 1994, he joined Unitech Telecom and became the co-founder of [[UTStarcom|UTStarcom Holdings Corp.]] a year later. After that, Huang developed the [[operating system]] WACOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mall.cnki.net/magazine/Article/DXJS200604038.htm|title=让数字电视随心看——访UT斯达康高级副总裁兼首席技术官黄晓庆-《电信技术》2006年04期-中国知网|accessdate=31 August 2017|work=mall.cnki.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Huang put forward the "Network is the Switch" soft switch concept. That same year, he co-established the International Soft switch Consortium (ISC) and developed the first mobile soft switch system in the world and the first carrier-class streaming media exchange and IPTV system.&lt;ref name="labs"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://labs.chinamobile.com/members/info_7|title=中国移动研究院|accessdate=31 August 2017|work=labs.chinamobile.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the aim to build a research and development center like Bell Labs, Huang joined [[China Mobile]] in 2007. He was the leader in China Mobile Research Institution, and later proposed the concept of constructing the three infrastructures (network, applications and terminals) of the next-generation mobile internet for the carriers. Besides, he built China Mobile "Big Cloud" cloud computing platform. The platform carried out development of cloud computing and big data platform, supporting the world's largest operator of public and private clouds construction and services.&lt;ref name="labs"/&gt;

In 2012, Huang created a new architecture for building intelligent robotics system, the cloud-based robot system. It contains the idea to split the robot into three parts, cloud, mobile network and terminal, which forms complete servicing robots that can assist companies and families.

'''CD-R King''' (styled as '''cd-r king''' or '''CD-R KING''') is a Filipino retail chain that sells discounted computer parts and gadgets, electronic appliances, and accessories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/28715/cd-r-king-opens-biggest-branch-in-cebu|title=CD-R King opens biggest branch in Cebu|last=PR|date=May 3, 2014|newspaper=Cebu Daily News|access-date=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geeky-guide.com/2009/10/philippines-cd-r-king.html|title=[Philippines] CD-R King|website=Geeky Guide|access-date=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yugatech.com/toys-gadgets/10-cool-gadgets-that-you-can-buy-from-cd-r-king/|title=Yugatech - CD-R King|last=|first=|date=|website=Yugatech|publisher=|access-date=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; CD-R King's branches are often located in malls, where they compete against higher-end electronics retailers.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdrking.com/branches/|title=CD-R King|website=www.cdrking.com|access-date=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
CD-R King has initially been known for selling recordable media in bulk at a fraction of the cost since the early 2000s, but has since expanded their line to other products in response to changing market and technological trends over the years, even going so far as to offering goods which have little or nothing to do with optical media or information technology in general, (e.g. ornaments and other such accessories; this prompted the introduction of their branding divisions like STARK for appliances, California ECO-BIKE for [[electric bicycle]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/191153/cd-r-king-affirms-efforts-to-help-clean-the-environment-through-california-e-bikes/|title=CD-R King affirms efforts to help clean the environment through California E-bikes|website=Philippine Daily Inquirer|access-date=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile King for [[cell phones]], and Kenko World for their cell phone accessories and health and beauty products). Most of CD-R King's products are sourced from [[original design manufacturer]]s from [[China]], [[Taiwan]] and other countries, and are sold under [[Store brand|their own brand]]. Many CD-R King-branded products are re-branded versions of the same or similar products sold in parallel by their manufacturers.

It since became the popular gadget store in Metro Manila and spread out to [[Luzon]], then to [[Cebu City]], and later has branches nationwide with more than 350 branches (excluding Kenko World branches) in all major shopping mall chains in the country.

===Copyright concerns===
The company's operations gained controversy as the [[Optical Media Board]] accused CD-R King in 2008 of facilitating [[copyright infringement]] through inexpensive media supplied by the company,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.alleba.com/blog/2008/02/07/cd-r-king-pirate-kings-of-smuggling/|title=CD-R King - Pirate Kings of Smuggling?|date=February 7, 2016|newspaper=Alleba Blog|access-date=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; imposing a P1.5 million penalty for failing to produce permits for some of its optical media disc importations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2013, [[Globe Telecom]] has signed agreements with several major retailers of gadgets and IT equipment, including CD-R King, in a bid to curb the sale of illegal repeaters or signal boosters in the country. The agreement binds retailers from selling signal boosters that do not comply with the specifications set by the [[National Telecommunications Commission (Philippines)|National Telecommunications Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/business/09/23/13/cd-r-king-retailers-stop-selling-illegal-signal-boosters|title=CD-R King, retailers to stop selling illegal signal boosters|last=|first=|work=ABS-CBN News|access-date=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7308">[[File:Verner Eisby - Inventor of Corona treatment.JPG|thumb|right|Verner Eisby, a Danish engineer, the inventor of corona treatment.]]

'''Corona treatment''' (sometimes referred to as '''air plasma''') is a surface modification technique that uses a low temperature [[corona discharge]] plasma to impart changes in the properties of a surface. The corona [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] is generated by the application of high voltage to an electrode that has a sharp tip. The plasma forms at the tip. A linear array of electrodes is often used to create a curtain of corona plasma.  Materials such as plastics, cloth, or paper may be passed through the corona plasma curtain in order to change the surface energy of the material.  All materials have an inherent [[surface energy]].  Surface treatment systems are available for virtually any surface format including dimensional objects, sheets and roll goods that are handled in a web format. Corona treatment is a widely used surface treatment method in the plastic film, extrusion, and converting industries.

==History==
The corona treatment was invented by the Danish engineer Verner Eisby in 1951. Verner had been asked by one of his customers if he could find a solution which would make it possible to print on plastic. 
Verner found that there were already a couple of ways to accomplish this. One was a gas flame method and the other was a spark generating method, both of which were crude and uncontrollable and did not produce a homogeneous product. Verner came up with the theory that a high frequency corona discharge would provide both a more efficient and controllable method to treat the surface. Exhaustive experiments proved him to be correct. Verner's company, Vetaphone, obtained patent rights for the new corona treatment system.

==Materials==
Many [[plastics]], such as [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]], have chemically inert and nonporous surfaces with low [[surface tension]]s causing them to be non-receptive to bonding with printing [[ink]]s, [[coating]]s, and [[adhesive]]s. Although results are invisible to the naked eye, surface treating modifies surfaces to improve adhesion.

Polyethylene, polypropylene, [[nylon]], [[Vinyl polymer|vinyl]], [[PVC]], [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]], metalized surfaces, foils, paper, and [[paperboard]] stocks are commonly treated by this method. It is safe, economical, and delivers high line speed throughput. Corona treatment is also suitable for the treatment of [[Injection molding|injection]] and [[Blow molding|blow]] molded parts, and is capable of treating multiple surfaces and difficult parts with a single pass. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Equipment==
Corona discharge equipment consists of a [[high-frequency]] power generator, a [[high-voltage]] [[transformer]], a stationary [[electrode]], and a treater ground roll.  Standard utility electrical power is converted into higher frequency power which is then supplied to the treater station. The treater station applies this power through [[ceramic]] or [[metal]] electrodes over an air gap onto the material’s surface.

Two basic corona treater stations are used in [[extrusion coating]] applications—''Bare Roll'' and ''Covered Roll''. On a bare roll treater station, the dielectric encapsulates the electrode. On a covered roll station, it encapsulates the treater base roll. The treater consists of an electrode and a base roll in both stations. In theory a covered roll treater is generally used to treat non-conductive webs, and a Bare Roll treater is used to treat conductive webs. However, manufacturers who treat a variety of substrates on the same production line may choose to use a Bare Roll treater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Corona Treating for Coating Applications | url = http://www.faustel.com/technical-library/corona-treating-for-coating-applications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-treatment==
Many substrates provide a better bonding surface when they are treated at the time they are produced. This is called “pre-treatment.” The effects of corona treatment diminish over time.  Therefore many surfaces will require a second “bump” treatment at the time they are converted to ensure bonding with printing inks, coatings, and adhesives.

==Other technologies==
Other technologies used for surface treatment include in-line atmospheric (air) plasma, flame plasma, and chemical plasma systems.

===Atmospheric plasma treatment===
[[Atmospheric-pressure plasma]] treatment is very similar to corona treatment but there are a few differences between them. Both treatments may use one or more high voltage electrodes which charge the surrounding blown gas molecules and ionizes them. However in atmospheric plasma systems, the overall plasma density is much greater which enhances the rate and degree to which the ionized molecules are incorporated onto a materials' surface. An increased rate of ion bombardment occurs which may result in stronger material bonding traits depending on the gas molecules used in the process. Atmospheric plasma treatment technology also eliminates a possibility of treatment on a material's non-treated side; also known as backside treatment.

===Flame plasma===
Flame plasma treaters generate more heat than other treating processes, but materials treated through this method tend to have a longer shelf-life. These plasma systems are different from air plasma systems because flame plasma occurs when flammable gas and surrounding air are combusted into an intense blue flame. Objects’ surfaces are [[Polarizability|polarized]] from the flame plasma affecting the distribution of the surface’s [[electron]]s in an [[oxidation]] form.  This treatment requires higher temperatures so many of the materials that are treated with a flame plasma can be damaged.

===Chemical plasma===
Chemical plasma is based on the combination of air plasma and flame plasma. Much like air plasma, chemical plasma fields are generated from electrically charged air. But, instead of air, chemical plasma relies on a mixture of other gases depositing various [[chemical group]]s onto the treated surface.

He is the founder and former president of the [[Romanian Humanist Party]], later renamed the Conservative Party (PC). He was a [[Romanian Senate|senator]] from 2004 until his resignation in 2012.

Dan Voiculescu was one of the richest men in Romania, with a fortune estimated at 1.5 - 1.6 billion euros, according to Top 300 Richest Romanian People launched by the Capital magazine on October 2009. The [[Intact Media Group]], founded by Dan Voiculescu, includes several major television stations (most notably [[Antena 1 (Romania)|Antena 1]] and [[Antena 3 (Romania)|Antena 3]]), radio stations, as well as top newspapers and magazines (most notably [[Jurnalul Naţional]] and [[Gazeta Sporturilor]]). According to Top 300 issued by Capital,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediafax.ro/cultura-media/top-300-capital-familia-voiculescu-si-dinu-patriciu-cei-mai-bogati-romani-din-mass-media-4988595]&lt;/ref&gt; developing televisions and launching GSP TV and Radio station ZU, as well as strengthening the print media, have been among the main directions that have marked the group's businesses in 2008.

In August 2014, Voiculescu was found guilty and sentenced to ten years in prison for money laundering.&lt;ref&gt;http://anticoruptie.hotnews.ro/ancheta-7475495-dosarul-dan-voiculescu.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Voiculescu was born in [[Bucharest]], in a family of modest means, who lived in the Bariera Vergului neighborhood. For his secondary studies, he went to the [[Emil Racoviţă]] High School.&lt;ref name=foundation&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.aoar.ro/cv/voicules.htm "Preşedinte Fondator - Dan Voiculescu"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20000518013126/http://www.aoar.ro/cv/voicules.htm |date=2000-05-18 }}, biography at Dan Voiculescu Humanist Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1969, he studied at the [[Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies|Academy of Economic Studies]] (ASE) in [[Bucharest]], obtaining a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1974, and a [[Ph.D]] in 1977.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.danvoiculescu.net/en/ Dan Voiculescu web site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523073155/http://www.danvoiculescu.net/en/ |date=May 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, he obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the [[educational accreditation|unaccredited]] [[Pacific Western University (Hawaii)]], in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]], and became a professor at ASE.&lt;ref name=foundation/&gt;

According to the autobiography published on the official website, he was born in a modest family, his father being a plumber and his mother a housewife. He grew up in the Bucharest neighborhood of Bariera Vergului, near the 23 August skating rink, where he practiced ice hockey. In 1969 he fulfilled the military service in a military unit in Focsani.

Before the 1989 revolution, he lived in a state rental house and drove a Dacia purchased in installments. Working in the foreign trade, of his allowance of $7 per day, he was able – according to the same autobiography - to gather over 21 years, 30 thousand dollars, which he deposited to BRCE and have been the starting capital of the GRIVCO group.

==Political activities==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
In 1991, Voiculescu founded the Humanist Party of Romania, which changed its name to the Conservative Party (PC) in May 2005. Under Voiculescu's leadership, the party also markedly changed its doctrine to embrace [[Conservatism|conservative]] values in line with the views of the [[European People's Party]] in the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epp-ed.eu/Press/showpr.asp?PRControlDocTypeID=1&amp;PRControlID=3732&amp;PRContentID=6935&amp;PRContentLG=en "EPP-ED-Bureau Meeting in Bucharest: 'Romania must do its job'"], June 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The PC, however, did not join the European People's Party.

The PC, then called the PUR, supported the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD)-led government from 2000 to 2004, and ran in coalition with the PSD in the 2004 parliamentary and presidential elections.

The PC was also part of the ruling coalition led by Prime Minister [[Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu]] from December 2004 until the party withdrew in 2006. According to [[Freedom House]], one reason the government of Popescu-Tăriceanu included the small PC, which received support from only 2 percent of the population, was due to the strength of Voiculescu family's Antenna 1 television station.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freedomhouse.org/inc/content/pubs/nit/inc_country_detail.cfm?page=47&amp;nit=387&amp;year=2006&amp;pf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Gerard Gallagher|Tom Gallagher]], a Romania specialist at [[Bradford University]], stated in January 2005, shortly after the PC entered the government, that Voiculescu "is a potentially major problem if the government decides to introduce legislation that will challenge vested interests which have profited through the questionable sale of state assets."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/9594.html "Dan Voiculescu's Tainted Past Dogs Humanist Party In Romania"], ''[[Financial Times]]'', January 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

PC ran in a coalition with PSD in the 2008 legislative elections, and Voiculescu was elected senator in a Bucharest district.

As member of the [[Romanian Senate]], Voiculescu has been strong in his opposition to Romanian President [[Traian Băsescu]], who he states has exceeded constitutional boundaries and abused power. In March, 2007, he established a special commission within the Parliament to investigate Băsescu's actions as president and sponsored the legislation in the Parliament that led to a national referendum over whether Băsescu should remain in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.hotnews.ro/MPs-decide-President-Basescu-breached-Constitution-articol_pda_1_-1_44554.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921100713/http://english.hotnews.ro/MPs-decide-President-Basescu-breached-Constitution-articol_pda_1_-1_44554.htm |archivedate=2007-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/countries/Romania/profile.cfm?folder=Profile-Political%20Forces Economist.com | Country Briefings: Romania&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Voiculescu was also strongly opposed to former Minister of Justice [[Monica Macovei]].

In April 2007, the Parliamentary Committee led by Senator Dan Voiculescu managed, for the first time in the post-revolutionary Romania, the suspension of an acting president. The report drawn up by the "Voiculescu Committee" was adopted in the Romanian Parliament, with 322 votes "for" and 108 "against"; President Traian Băsescu was thus suspended from his function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stiri.kappa.ro/politica/19-04-2007/traian-basescu-suspendat-128644.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718225754/http://stiri.kappa.ro/politica/19-04-2007/traian-basescu-suspendat-128644.html |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voiculescu opposed a draft law proposed by Justice Minister Monica Macovei and supported by the European Commission to set up a special agency for checking assets declarations for MPs and other senior officials. He subsequently supported a version characterized as "watered down" by the international media.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.evz.ro/categ.php?catid=7  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321043642/http://www.evz.ro/categ.php?catid=7 |date=March 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sar.org.ro/files/romania_final.pdf|title=Romania|last=MUNGIU-PIPPIDI|first=ALINA|date=|website=Societatea Academica Din Romania|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2007, Dan Voiculescu resigned from his senator function as a form of protest against the blocking in the Romanian Parliament, of various important social laws. They were about promoting his projects on extending the contracts of tenants in the nationalized houses, reducing VAT on food, solidarity fund for pensioners and non-taxation of reinvested profits, legislation designed to bring more money to pensioners with low incomes, to lower prices on basic food or assist companies to reinvest their profits.

On November 2008, by occasion of the first elections held in the plurality system, Dan Voiculescu returned to the Romanian Parliament, obtaining 21,708 votes in the 8th college in Bucharest, and in December 2008 he was elected Vice-President of the Senate of Romania, with 83 votes for and 2 against.

=== Voiculescu's Law ===

Voiculescu initiated a bill, now named after him, that allows tenants of buildings that were [[nationalized]] during communism to stay in them, while the former owners receive only financial compensation. After a long legislative and constitutional battle, president Băsescu signed it into law in 2009, even though he and his party opposed it. [[Emil Boc]]'s government however did not apply it, and was sued by tenants' associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.sfin.ro/articol_15678/guvernul_dat_in_judecata_pentru_neaplicarea_%E2%80%9Elegii_voiculescu%E2%80%9C.html Guvernul, dat în judecată pentru neaplicarea „Legii Voiculescu“] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325095513/http://www.sfin.ro/articol_15678/guvernul_dat_in_judecata_pentru_neaplicarea_%E2%80%9Elegii_voiculescu%E2%80%9C.html |date=2009-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secret police involvement==
Although he denied it for several years, in 2006 Voiculescu admitted having been a collaborator of the [[Securitate]],&lt;ref&gt;Craig S. Smith, [http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/12/11/news/spooks.php?page=1 "Cold War specter lingers in Eastern Europe"], ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', December 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Romania's [[Communist Romania|communist-era]] internal intelligence service, after information to this effect was released publicly by Romania's National Council for the Study of the Securitate Archives ([[CNSAS]]). At the time, Voiculescu was named to be a Vice Premier in the Popescu-Tăriceanu government, but was ultimately not allowed to take the position because of his involvement with the communist secret police.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.bbc.co.uk/romanian/forum/story/2006/06/060616_voiculescu_securitate_cnsas.shtml ''Dan Voiculescu şi fosta Securitate''], "Dan Voiculescu and the former Securitate", [[BBC News]], June 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Compton]], [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2003316215_suncompton22.html "The struggle for civil society in post-revolution Romania"], ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', October 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

CNSAS revealed that Voiculescu acted as an informer for the Securitate by the names of "Felix" and "Mircea". He later claimed that he only collaborated "two or three times" for economic espionage.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/12/11/news/spooks.php?page=2 "Cold War specter lingers in Eastern Europe"], ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', December 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and he had cooperated with the Securitate as "all Romanians did" during the communist period. The latter statement drew criticism from journalist [[Cristian Tudor Popescu]], who wrote that "Mr. Voiculescu knows very well there were millions of Romanians who didn't have anything to do with the Securitate and others who simply refused to work for it."&lt;ref&gt;Razvan Amariei, [http://www.csees.net/?page=country_analyses&amp;country_id=6&amp;ca_id=2181 "Transitions Online: The Meaning of "Political""] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928171038/http://www.csees.net/?page=country_analyses&amp;country_id=6&amp;ca_id=2181 |date=2007-09-28 }}, The Centre for SouthEast European Studies, June 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Voiculescu denies, however, having been an official collaborator (with a signed agreement) or an officer of the Securitate and is appealing the CNSAS' ruling to that effect. He has said he will resign from the Senate if the verdict is not overturned on appeal. He blamed the initial findings against him on Băsescu, who, according to Voiculescu, launched a campaign to undermine him.&lt;ref&gt;Ana Şerban, [http://www.nineoclock.ro/index.php?page=detalii&amp;categorie=politics&amp;id=20070320-507465 "Voiculescu’s appeal against CNSAS decision delayed in Court"], ''Nine O'Clock'', March 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Gallagher wrote in a 2004 paper&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ce-review.org/00/35/gallagher35.html Emerging from the Shadows]&lt;/ref&gt; that it is supposed that Dan Voiculescu held the rank of General within the  intelligence service before Romania's 1989 anti-communist revolution, but nothing has been proved till now. [[Ziua]] newspaper commented however that if Voiculescu was a "covert general" this fact would be extremely hard to prove; official records show that Voiculescu was a reserve army [[sub-lieutenant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hotnews.ro/articol_5394-Dan-Voiculescu-a-fost-general-in-serviciul-secret-al-lui-Ceausescu.htm "Dan Voiculescu a fost general in serviciul secret al lui Ceauşescu"], ''[[Ziua]]'', September 11, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006, Camelia Voiculescu, the owner of ''Jurnalul Naţional'', asked for editor [[Dorin Tudoran]]'s resignation,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.hotnews.ro/articol_52697-Camelia-Voiculescu-ii-cere-lui-Tuca-sa-l-concedieze-pe-Dorin-Tudoran.htm "Camelia Voiculescu îi cere lui Tuca să-l concedieze pe Dorin Tudoran"], HotNews.ro, July 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Dorin Tudoran, [http://www.jurnalul.ro/articole/16117/stimate-dle-marius-tuca "Stimate dle Marius Tuca"], ''Jurnalul Naţional'', July 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; following an editorial in which he criticized her father, Dan Voiculescu, for his past association with the Securitate.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Dorin Tudoran, [http://www.jurnalul.ro/articole/16953/felix-mircea-si-dorin "Felix, Mircea şi Dorin"], ''Jurnalul Naţional'', July 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A verdict however unattested by the Justice, according to the law. The case is pending.

On March 5, 2010, the Court of Appeal upheld that Dan Voiculescu has collaborated with the Securitate during the communist regime, having the conspiratorial name “Felix”. Subsequently, the decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which upheld the Court of Appeal solution.

==Corruption investigation==

The Romanian National Anti-corruption Department (DNA) announced on April 3, 2007, that it was investigating Voiculescu, his daughter, and several business associates for [[money laundering]], with regard to funds obtained through the national lottery. Voiculescu denied all the charges, claiming the investigation was politically motivated and that the transactions were legal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.hotnews.ro/Political-leader-Dan-Voiculescu-others-under-criminal-inquiry-for-money-laundering-articol_44648.htm "Political leader Dan Voiculescu, others under criminal inquiry for money laundering"], HotNews.ro, April 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Voiculescu has been accused of other corruption scandals, including an alleged scheme whereby [[Grivco]], a company he owned, bought [[electrical energy]] from the state-controlled [[Rovinari]] complex, and sold the energy back to Electrica, another state-controlled company, at a large profit.&lt;ref name=sercan&gt;{{ro icon}} Emilia Şercan, [http://www.expres.ro/article.php?artid=298384 "Voiculescu, piratul kilowaţilor"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930043840/http://www.expres.ro/article.php?artid=298384 |date=2007-09-30 }}, ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', March 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.hotnews.ro/What-the-newspapers-say-March-29-2007-articol_44608.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111530/http://english.hotnews.ro/What-the-newspapers-say-March-29-2007-articol_44608.htm |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/04/03/europe/EU-GEN-Romania-Opposition-Politician.php Romanian media mogul and politician investigated on money laundering charges - International Herald Tribune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Through a spokesman, Voiculescu declined to comment, on the grounds that in December 2004, at the time the contract was signed, he was just a shareholder, and not an administrator of Grivco.&lt;ref name=sercan/&gt;

In October 2009, following some articles in the press,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanialibera.ro/a168442/politicieni-datori-milioane-de-euro-la-fisc.html]&lt;/ref&gt; the Vice-President of the Romanian Senate, Dan Voiculescu, has undergone a vetting process carried out by the National Agency for Fiscal Administration (ANAF),&lt;ref&gt;[http://danvoiculescu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/comunicat-de-presa-anaf.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; verification based on which ANAF has established &lt;ref&gt;[http://danvoiculescu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/hppscan28.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; that the allegations surrounding the Senator Dan Voiculescu have no real basis.

On September 26 2013 Dan Voiculescu was found guilty and sentenced to 5 years in prison. In the case of using his political connections to influence the  sell of the Institute for Alimentary Research to Grivco a company that he had a stake in. The case was postponed several years because Dan Voiculescu resigned several times for the Romanian Parliament.

On August 08 2014 Dan Voiculescu was found guilty an sentenced to 10 years in prison for money laundering. Money, a plot of land and a house were also confiscated to cover the state's losses.&lt;ref&gt;http://business-review.eu/featured/romanian-media-mogul-dan-voiculescu-sentenced-to-ten-years-in-prison-68412&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 10 2017 he was released from prison.

== Criticism ==

President Băsescu has accused Voiculescu of being a "media mogul" who uses his media group to fight political battles. He further accused Voiculescu of trying to control, through the media, the politics of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stiri.rol.ro/content/view/34889/2/ Stiri ROL.ro - Basescu: Voiculescu, Vintu si Patriciu utilizeaza trusturile media in batalia politica&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327192258/http://stiri.rol.ro/content/view/34889/2/ |date=2009-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007, Băsescu said "Oligarchs should not be confused with the business community.
They are the few who have made fortunes thanks to facilities from government, people who have become very rich and now give orders to politicians, those who are supported financially by the oligarchs and who have turned into puppets of certain businessmen like Voiculescu, [Rompetrol owner Dinu] [[Dinu Patriciu|Patriciu]], and many others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.hotnews.ro/Romanians-are-the-ones-to-decide-what-sort-of-state-Romania-should-be-articol_44960.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516064617/http://english.hotnews.ro/Romanians-are-the-ones-to-decide-what-sort-of-state-Romania-should-be-articol_44960.htm |archivedate=2007-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] report on the [[Romanian presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential election]] found that the newspaper [[Jurnalul Naţional]] and television station [[Antena 1 (Romania)|Antena 1]], both owned by Voiculescu's family, were biased against the incumbent Băsescu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/documents/odihr/2009/12/41929_en.pdf OSCE second round preliminary report]&lt;/ref&gt; In the last years, Voiculescu tried to reinvent his public image through the Internet. He started a personal blog, showing a much lighter side of his personality,&lt;ref&gt;[http://danvoiculescu.net/blog/ Întâlnire cu Dan Voiculescu]&lt;/ref&gt; and even began writing satirical guest posts for online journals non-related to his media empire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailycotcodac.ro/author/dan-voiculescu/ Daily Cotcodac] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208140517/http://www.dailycotcodac.ro/author/dan-voiculescu/ |date=2011-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Donna Auguste''' (born 1958) is an African-American businesswoman, entrepreneur, and philanthropist.  She was the founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Freshwater Software from 1996 to 2001.  Prior to Freshwater Software, she was a senior engineering manager at [[Apple Computer]] who helped to coordinate the development of the [[Newton PDA|Newton personal digital assistant]] (PDA).&lt;ref name="first"&gt;Brown, Carolyn. [http://www.blackenterprise.com/magazine/2000/11/01/shes-fresh She's Fresh]. Black Enterprise Magazine. (November 1, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="second"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/breakthrough/resource/augustebio.htm Breakthrough: Donna Auguste] PBS.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, she sold Freshwater Software to [[Mercury Interactive]] Corp. for $147 million.  In the same year, she was recognized as one of the "25 Women Who Are Making It Big in Small Business" by [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2001/03/01/298108/index.htm 25 Women]. Fortune Magazine. (March 1, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; She also won the 2001 [[Golden Torch]] Award for Outstanding Woman in Technology.&lt;ref name="third"&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/donna-m-auguste Golden Torch Award]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Donna Auguste was born in [[Texas]] but relocated to [[Louisiana]] and then to [[Berkeley, California]].  She and her four sisters were raised by their mother. Since an early age, Auguste loved to tinker with things: from taking apart [[doorbell]]s to disassembling toasters and other electrical appliances.  After graduating from high school, she enrolled in the [[electrical engineering]] and [[computer science]] (EECS) program at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] where she overcame many obstacles to earn her undergraduate Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.  She did graduate study in
computer science at [[Carnegie-Mellon University]], where she earned her MS degree in 1983.&lt;ref name="first"/&gt;&lt;ref name="second"/&gt;

==Career==
While conducting research in [[applied science]] and [[artificial intelligence]] at Carnegie-Mellon University, Auguste interned at [[Xerox Corporation]]'s [[Palo Alto Research Center]] and met the future founders of [[IntelliCorp (software)|IntelliCorp]].  Auguste was hired by IntelliCorp as a software engineer in 1986 to work on technology products that incorporated artificial intelligence.  After spending four years at IntelliCorp, Auguste took a break from work for two months to bike through Japan's countryside.  Upon her return, Auguste was hired by Apple Computer in 1990 to serve as lead software engineering manager for the Newton PDA development project.  While at Apple Computer, Auguste was well-liked and won praises for her managerial skills as well as technical contributions (she held various patents for her work on the Newton PDA).&lt;ref name="first"/&gt;&lt;ref name="second"/&gt;

In 1996, Auguste relocated to [[Boulder, Colorado]] and joined U.S. West Advanced Technologies as senior director of [[multimedia]] [[systems engineering]] and [[Systems development|development]].  While working on [[interactive television]] applications for the company's [[Fiber-optic communication|fiber-optic]] broadband network, Auguste foresaw the potential of the internet and later launched her own company: Freshwater Software Inc., a provider of software solutions for maintaining and monitoring business-critical [[web application]]s.  Freshwater Software grew rapidly from a tiny [[Startup company|start-up]] into a nationally recognized multimillion-dollar software provider which boasted [[Fortune 500]] clients such as [[Alta Vista]], [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], [[Go.com]], and [[Merrill Lynch]].  Freshwater Software was later purchased by Mercury Interactive Corp. of California for $147 million in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://denver.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2001/05/21/daily9.html Freshwater Software Sold]. Denver Business Journal. (May 21, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fourth"&gt;[http://www.informit.com/authors/bio.aspx?a=92bc70aa-1aec-43aa-8d9a-4f20fe7675d7 Donna Auguste]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Upon retiring after the sale of Freshwater Software, Auguste founded the Leave a Little Room Foundation, LLC, a philanthropic organization that helps provide housing, electricity, and vaccinations to poor and underprivileged communities around the world.&lt;ref name="fourth"/&gt;

In 2009, Auguste was awarded $750,000 from [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]] as a settlement for winning a high-profile [[lawsuit]] stemming from questionable tactics used by the prosecutor from the [[district attorney]]'s office in a criminal case where Auguste's  Colorado home was searched in connection with her nephew Damon Auguste's rape conviction which was later overturned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercurynews.com/search/ci_13527582?IADID High-tech entrepreneur to get ,50,000 from Santa Clara County in settlement over questionable house search]. San Jose Mercury News. (October 9, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; She is a Catholic and a member of Cure d'Ars Parish in [[Denver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Illinois, Colorado Catholics offer helping hand to Mississippi parish|url=http://www.americancatholic.org/News/katrina/KatrinaPas.asp|work=americancatholic.org|agency=CNS|date=September 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Electrolysis Apparatus.png|thumb|Illustration of an electrolysis apparatus used in a school laboratory.]]
In [[chemistry]] and [[manufacturing]], '''electrolysis''' is a technique that uses a [[Direct current|direct]] [[electric current]] (DC) to drive an otherwise non-spontaneous chemical reaction. Electrolysis is commercially important as a stage in the [[#Industrial uses|separation]] of [[chemical element|elements]] from naturally occurring sources such as [[ores]] using an [[electrolytic cell]]. The [[voltage]] that is needed for electrolysis to occur is called the [[decomposition potential]].

==History==
The word "electrolysis" was introduced by [[Michael Faraday]] in the 19th century, on the suggestion of the Rev. [[William Whewell]], using the [[Greek language|Greek]] words {{lang|grc|ἤλεκτρον}} {{IPA-el|ɛ̌ːlektron|}} "amber", which since the 17th century was associated with [[electricity|electric phenomena]], and ''{{lang|grc|λύσις}}'' {{IPA-el|lýsis|}} meaning "dissolution". Nevertheless, electrolysis, as a tool to study chemical reactions and obtain pure [[chemical element|elements]], precedes the coinage of the term and formal description by Faraday.
* 1785 – [[Martinus van Marum]]'s electrostatic generator was used to reduce [[tin]], [[zinc]], and [[antimony]] from their salts using electrolysis.&lt;ref&gt;The Supplement (1803 edition) to Encyclopædia Britannica 3rd edition (1797), volume 1, page 225, "Mister Van Marum, by means of his great electrical machine, decomposed the calces of tin, zinc, and antimony, and resolved them into their respective metals and oxygen" and gives as a reference Journal de Physiques, 1785.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1800 – [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]] and [[Anthony Carlisle]] (view also [[Johann Ritter]]), decomposed [[water]] into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]].
* 1808 – [[Potassium]] (1807), [[sodium]] (1807), [[barium]], [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] were discovered by [[Sir Humphry Davy#Electrolysis|Sir Humphry Davy]] using electrolysis.
* 1821 – [[Lithium]] was discovered by the English chemist [[William Thomas Brande]], who obtained it by electrolysis of lithium oxide.
* 1833 – [[Michael Faraday]] develops his [[Faraday's laws of electrolysis|two laws of electrolysis]], and provides a mathematical explanation of his laws.
* 1875 – [[Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran]] discovered [[gallium]] using electrolysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Crookes, William |title=The Chemical news and journal of industrial science; with which is incorporated the "Chemical gazette.": A journal of practical chemistry in all its applications to pharmacy, arts and manufactures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XgDOAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA294|accessdate=27 February 2011|year=1875|publisher=Chemical news office.|pages=294–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1886 – [[Fluorine]] was discovered by [[Henri Moissan]] using electrolysis.
* 1886 – [[Hall–Héroult process]] developed for making [[aluminium]]
* 1890 – [[Castner–Kellner process]] developed for making [[sodium hydroxide]]

==Overview==
Electrolysis is the passing of a [[Direct current|direct]] [[electric current]] through an [[ion]]ic substance that is either molten or dissolved in a suitable solvent, producing chemical reactions at the electrodes and a separation of the materials.

The main components required to achieve electrolysis are:
* An [[electrolyte]]: a [[Chemical substance|substance]], frequently an ion-conducting [[polymer]] that contains free [[ion]]s, which carry [[electric current]] in the [[electrolyte]].  If the [[ion]]s are not mobile, as in most solid [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s, then electrolysis cannot occur.
* A [[direct current]] (DC) electrical supply: provides the [[energy]] necessary to create or discharge the [[ion]]s in the [[electrolyte]]. Electric current is carried by [[electron]]s in the external circuit.
* Two [[electrode]]s: [[electrical conductor]]s that provide the physical interface between the [[electrolyte]] and the [[electrical circuit]] that provides the [[energy]].

Electrodes of [[metal]], [[graphite]] and [[semiconductor]] material are widely used. Choice of suitable electrode depends on chemical reactivity between the electrode and electrolyte and manufacturing cost.

===Process of electrolysis===
The key process of electrolysis is the interchange of atoms and ions by the removal or addition of electrons from the external circuit. The desired products of electrolysis are often in a different physical state from the electrolyte and can be removed by some physical processes. For example, in the electrolysis of [[brine]] to produce hydrogen and chlorine, the products are gaseous. These gaseous products bubble from the electrolyte and are collected.&lt;ref name="Tilley2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tilley, R. J. D. |title=Understanding solids: the science of materials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFZ0guoKD1QC&amp;pg=PA281|accessdate=22 October 2011|year=2004|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-470-85276-7|pages=281–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 NaCl + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 NaOH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

A liquid containing electrolyte is produced by:
* [[Solvation]] or reaction of an [[ionic compound]] with a [[solvent]] (such as water) to produce mobile ions
* An ionic compound is melted by heating

An electrical potential is applied across a pair of [[electrode]]s immersed in the electrolyte. &lt;!--
Many people misunderstand these definitions and think they should be the other way round. Please read the [[electrode]] article before trying to 'correct' them. Also see the [[anode]] and [[cathode]] articles. The definition is: "The anode is now defined as the electrode at which electrons leave the cell and oxidation occurs, and the cathode as the electrode at which electrons enter the cell and reduction occurs." For electrolysis, this means the anode is the positive electrode and the cathode is the negative electrode. The positively-charged ions move towards the negative electrode, the cathode. The negatively-charged ions move towards the positive electrode, the anode. --&gt;

Each electrode attracts ions that are of the opposite [[Electric charge|charge]]. Positively charged ions ([[cation]]s) move towards the electron-providing (negative) cathode. Negatively charged ions ([[anion]]s) move towards the electron-extracting (positive) anode.

In this process [[electron]]s are either absorbed or released. Neutral atoms gain or lose electrons and become charged ions that then pass into the electrolyte. The formation of uncharged atoms from ions is called discharging. When an ion gains or loses enough electrons to become uncharged (neutral) atoms, the newly formed atoms separate from the electrolyte. Positive metal ions like Cu&lt;sup&gt;++  &lt;/sup&gt;deposit onto the cathode in a layer. The terms for this are [[electroplating]], [[electrowinning]], and [[electrorefining]].  When an ion gains or loses electrons without becoming neutral, its electronic charge is altered in the process. In chemistry, the loss of electrons is called [[Oxidation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, while electron gain is called reduction.

===Oxidation and reduction at the electrodes===
[[Oxidation]] of ions or neutral molecules occurs at the [[anode]]. For example, it is possible to oxidize ferrous ions to ferric ions at the anode:
: Fe{{su|p = 2+}}(aq) → Fe{{su|p = 3+}}(aq) + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
[[Redox|Reduction]] of ions or neutral molecules occurs at the [[cathode]].

It is possible to reduce [[ferricyanide]] ions to [[ferrocyanide]] ions at the cathode:
:Fe(CN){{su|p=3-|b=6}} + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → Fe(CN){{su|p=4-|b=6}}

Neutral molecules can also react at either of the electrodes. For example: p-Benzoquinone can be reduced to hydroquinone at the cathode:

[[Image:P-Benzochinon.svg|35px]] + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → [[Image:Hydrochinon2.svg]]

In the last example, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions (hydrogen ions) also take part in the reaction, and are provided by an acid in the solution, or by the solvent itself (water, methanol etc.). Electrolysis reactions involving H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are fairly common in acidic solutions. In aqueous alkaline  solutions, reactions involving OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (hydroxide ions) are common.

Sometimes the solvents themselves (usually water) are oxidized or reduced at the electrodes. It is even possible to have electrolysis involving gases. Such as when using a [[Gas diffusion electrode]].

===Energy changes during electrolysis===
The amount of electrical energy that must be added equals the change in [[Gibbs free energy]] of the reaction plus the losses in the system. The losses can (in theory) be arbitrarily close to zero, so the maximum [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] efficiency equals the [[enthalpy]] change divided by the free energy change of the reaction. In most cases, the electric input is larger than the enthalpy change of the reaction, so some energy is released in the form of heat. In some cases, for instance, in the electrolysis of [[steam]] into hydrogen and oxygen at high temperature, the opposite is true and heat energy is absorbed. This heat is absorbed from the surroundings, and the [[heating value]] of the produced hydrogen is higher than the electric input.

===Related techniques===
The following techniques are related to electrolysis:
* [[Electrochemical cell]]s, including the hydrogen [[fuel cell]], use differences in [[Standard electrode potential]] to generate an electrical potential that provides useful power. Though related via the interaction of ions and electrodes, electrolysis and the operation of electrochemical cells are quite distinct. However, a chemical cell should ''not'' be seen as performing ''electrolysis in reverse''.

==Faraday's laws of electrolysis==
{{main|Faraday's laws of electrolysis}}

===First law of electrolysis===
In 1832, Michael Faraday reported that the quantity of elements separated by passing an electric current through a molten or dissolved [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] is proportional to the quantity of electric charge passed through the circuit. This became the basis of the first law of electrolysis:
:&lt;math&gt;m = k \cdot q&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;m = e \cdot Q&lt;/math&gt;

where;
e is known as electrochemical equivalent of the metal deposited or of the gas liberated at the electrode.

===Second law of electrolysis===
Faraday discovered that when the same amount of current is passed through different electrolytes/elements connected in series, the mass of substance liberated/deposited at the electrodes  is directly proportional to their [[equivalent weight]].

==Industrial uses==
[[Image:hall-heroult-kk-2008-12-31.png|thumb|[[Hall-Heroult process]] for producing [[aluminium]]]]
* [[Electrometallurgy]] is the process of reduction of metals from metallic compounds to obtain the pure form of metal using electrolysis. [[Aluminium]], [[lithium]], [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[magnesium]], [[calcium]], and in some cases [[copper]], are produced in this way.
* Production of [[chlorine]] and [[sodium hydroxide]]
* Production of [[sodium chlorate]] and [[potassium chlorate]]
* Production of perfluorinated organic compounds such as [[trifluoroacetic acid]] by the process of [[electrofluorination]]
* Production of [[Copper extraction techniques#Electrorefining|electrolytic copper]] as a [[cathode]], from refined [[copper]] of lower purity as an [[anode]].

Electrolysis has many other uses:
* Production of [[oxygen]] for [[spacecraft]] and [[nuclear submarines]].
* Production of [[hydrogen]] for fuel, using a cheap source of electrical energy.

Electrolysis is also used in the cleaning and preservation of old artifacts. Because the process separates the non-metallic particles from the metallic ones, it is very useful for cleaning a wide variety of metallic objects, from old coins to even larger objects including [[rust]]ed [[cast iron]] [[cylinder block]]s and [[cylinder head|heads]] when rebuilding automobile engines. [[Rust removal]] from small iron or steel objects by electrolysis can be done in a home workshop using simple materials such as a plastic bucket, [[tap water]], lengths of [[rebar]], [[Sodium carbonate|washing soda]], [[baling wire]], and a [[battery charger]].&lt;ref name="antique-engines"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rust Removal using Electrolysis|url=http://antique-engines.com/electrol.asp|website=antique-engines.com|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacturing processes===
In manufacturing, electrolysis can be used for:
* [[Electroplating]], where a thin film of metal is deposited over a substrate material. Electroplating is used in many industries for either functional or decorative purposes, as in vehicle bodies and nickel coins.
* [[Electrochemical machining]] (ECM), where an electrolytic cathode is used as a shaped tool for removing material by anodic oxidation from a workpiece. ECM is often used as technique for [[Burr (edge)|deburring]] or for etching metal surfaces like tools or knives with a permanent mark or logo.

==Competing half-reactions in solution electrolysis==
Using a cell containing inert platinum electrodes, electrolysis of aqueous solutions of some salts leads to reduction of the cations (e.g., metal deposition with, e.g., zinc salts) and oxidation of the anions (e.g. evolution of bromine with bromides). However, with salts of some metals (e.g. sodium) hydrogen is evolved at the cathode, and for salts containing some anions (e.g. sulfate SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) oxygen is evolved at the anode. In both cases this is due to water being reduced to form hydrogen or oxidized to form oxygen.
In principle the voltage required to electrolyze a salt solution can be derived from the [[standard electrode potential]] for the reactions at the anode and cathode. The [[standard electrode potential]] is directly related to the [[Gibbs free energy]], ΔG, for the reactions at each electrode and refers to an electrode with no current flowing. An extract from the [[table of standard electrode potentials]] is shown below.

In terms of electrolysis, this table should be interpreted as follows:
* Oxidized species (often a cation) with a more negative cell potential are more difficult to reduce than oxidized species with a more positive cell potential. For example, it is more difficult to reduce a sodium ion to a sodium metal than it is to reduce a zinc ion to a zinc metal.
* Reduced species (often an anion) with a more positive cell potential are more difficult to oxidize than reduced species with a more negative cell potential. For example, it is more difficult to oxidize sulfate anions than it is to oxidize bromide anions.

Using the [[Nernst equation]] the [[electrode potential]] can be calculated for a specific concentration of ions, temperature and the number of electrons involved. For pure water ([[pH]] 7):
* the electrode potential for the reduction producing hydrogen is −0.41 V
* the electrode potential for the oxidation producing oxygen is +0.82 V.
Comparable figures calculated in a similar way, for 1M [[zinc bromide]], ZnBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are −0.76 V for the reduction to Zn metal and +1.10 V for the oxidation producing bromine.
The conclusion from these figures is that hydrogen should be produced at the cathode and oxygen at the anode from the electrolysis of water—which is at variance with the experimental observation that zinc metal is deposited and bromine is produced.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, A.E. (1951), ''A textbook of Quantitative Inorganic Analysis'', Longmans, Green and Co&lt;/ref&gt;
The explanation is that these calculated potentials only indicate the thermodynamically preferred reaction. In practice many other factors have to be taken into account such as the kinetics of some of the reaction steps involved. These factors together mean that a higher potential is required for the reduction and oxidation of water than predicted, and these are termed [[overpotential]]s. Experimentally it is known that [[overpotential]]s depend on the design of the cell and the nature of the electrodes.

For the electrolysis of a neutral (pH 7) sodium chloride solution, the reduction of sodium ion is thermodynamically very difficult and water is reduced evolving hydrogen leaving hydroxide ions in solution. At the anode the oxidation of chlorine is observed rather than the oxidation of water since the overpotential for the oxidation of [[chloride]] to [[chlorine]] is lower than the overpotential for the oxidation of [[water]] to [[oxygen]]. The [[hydroxide ion]]s and dissolved [[chlorine]] gas react further to form [[hypochlorous acid]]. The aqueous solutions resulting from this process is called [[electrolyzed water]] and is used as a disinfectant and cleaning agent.

===Electrolysis of acidified  water===
{{main|Electrolysis of water}}
Electrolysis of water produces [[hydrogen]].
:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g); E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = +1.229 V

The [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] of water electrolysis varies widely. The efficiency of an electrolyser is a measure of the enthalpy contained in the hydrogen (to undergo combustion with oxygen, or some other later reaction), compared with the input electrical energy. Heat/enthalpy values for hydrogen are well published in science and engineering texts, as 144 MJ/kg.  Note that fuel cells (not electrolysers) cannot use this full amount of heat/enthalpy, which has led to some confusion when calculating efficiency values for both types of technology.  In the reaction, some energy is lost as heat. Some reports quote efficiencies between 50% and 70% for alkaline electrolysers; however, much higher practical efficiencies are available with the use of PEM ([[polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis|Polymer Electrolyte Membrane electrolysis]]) and catalytic technology, such as 95% efficiency.&lt;ref name="carmo2013a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carmo|first=M|author2=Fritz D |author3=Mergel J |author4=Stolten D |title=A comprehensive review on PEM water electrolysis|journal=Journal of Hydrogen Energy|volume=38|issue=12|pages=4901|year=2013|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.01.151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[NREL]] estimated that 1&amp;nbsp;kg of hydrogen (roughly equivalent to 3&amp;nbsp;kg, or 4 L, of petroleum in energy terms) could be produced by wind powered electrolysis for between $5.55 in the near term and $2.27 in the long term.&lt;ref name="NRELElectrolysis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/39534.pdf |title=Wind Energy and Production of Hydrogen and Electricity – Opportunities for Renewable Hydrogen – Preprint |accessdate=20 October 2008 |author1=Levene, J.  |author2=Kroposki, B. |author3=Sverdrup, G. |date=March 2006 |format=PDF |work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 4% of hydrogen gas produced worldwide is generated by electrolysis, and normally used onsite. Hydrogen is used for the creation of ammonia for fertilizer via the [[Haber process]], and converting heavy petroleum sources to lighter fractions via [[hydrocracking]].

===Carbon/hydrocarbon assisted water electrolysis===
{{main|Hydrogen production}}
Recently, to reduce the energy input, the utilization of carbon ([[coal]]), [[alcohol]]s (hydrocarbon solution), and organic solution ([[glycerol]], formic acid, [[ethylene glycol]], etc.) with co-electrolysis of water has been proposed as a viable option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.electacta.2016.07.062|title=Electro-catalytic conversion of ethanol in solid electrolyte cells for distributed hydrogen generation|journal=Electrochimica Acta|volume=212|pages=744|year=2016|last1=Ju|first1=Hyungkuk|last2=Giddey|first2=Sarbjit|last3=Badwal|first3=Sukhvinder P.S.|last4=Mulder|first4=Roger J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carbon/hydrocarbon assisted water electrolysis (so-called CAWE) process for hydrogen generation would perform this operation in a single [[electrochemical]] reactor. This system energy balance can be required only around 40% electric input with 60% coming from the chemical energy of carbon or hydrocarbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.033|title=Low emission hydrogen generation through carbon assisted electrolysis|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|volume=40|pages=70|year=2015|last1=Giddey|first1=S.|last2=Kulkarni|first2=A.|last3=Badwal|first3=S.P.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process utilizes solid coal/carbon particles or powder as fuels dispersed in acid/alkaline electrolyte in the form of slurry and the carbon contained source co-assist in the electrolysis process as following theoretical overall reactions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.03.195|title=Role of iron species as mediator in a PEM based carbon-water co-electrolysis for cost-effective hydrogen production|journal=

&lt;/ref&gt;:

Carbon/Coal slurry (C + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) -&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;      E' = 0.21 V (reversible voltage) / E' = 0.46 V (thermo-neutral voltage)

or

Carbon/Coal slurry (C + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) -&gt; CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;         E' = 0.52 V reversible voltage) / E' = 0.91 V (thermo-neutral voltage)

Thus, this CAWE approach is that the actual cell overpotential can be significantly reduced to below 1 V as compared to 1.5 V for conventional water electrolysis.

===Electrocrystallization===
A specialized application of electrolysis involves the growth of conductive crystals on one of the electrodes from oxidized or reduced species that are generated in situ.  The technique has been used to obtain single crystals of low-dimensional electrical conductors, such as [[charge-transfer salt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja00399a065|title=Superconductivity in an organic solid.

'''Federico Eulogio Malo Andrade''' (5 July 1859 – 14 February 1932) was an [[Ecuador]]ian [[entrepreneur]] and prominent figure who made a [[Wealth|fortune]] from the [[export]]ation of [[panama hat]]s and [[quinine]], and with the foundation of financial institutions. He was born in [[Cuenca (Ecuador)|Cuenca]], on July 5, 1859, to Dr. Luis Malo Valdivieso, a lawyer and [[lieutenant colonel]] who also was a rich [[merchant]], and Mrs. Jesús Andrade Morales, niece of the President of Ecuador, Dr. Jeronimo Carrion y Palacio.

In 1877, he traveled to Europe to live in [[Paris]] and [[London]], where he studied economy and law. He stayed there until 1879, and returned to Cuenca, where he was established until 1883, when he returned to Paris. He became a friend of Juan Montalvo, an Ecuadorian writer resident there. When he finally went back to Cuenca in 1887, he married Mrs. Leticia de Andrade Chiriboga (1870–1935) on March 23, 1888. They had eleven children. That was the moment in his life where he became a very important person in Cuenca; he was Secretary of the City Council in 1891, French and English teacher at Benigno Malo National College of Cuenca in 1892, Congressman in 1896, Rector of Benigno Malo National College in 1896-1900; 1901–1906 and 1914–1916, President of the City Council in 1903, President of Azuay's Liberal Party in 1912, Governor of Azuay between 1916 and 1920, Senator in 1924, etc.

In 1912, he imported from London to Cuenca, the first automobile that arrived to the city. In 1913, he founded Cuenca's first Bank, ''Banco del Azuay'', and in 1919, Cuenca's Commerce Chamber. He participated in the opening of a branch of Ecuador's Central Bank in Cuenca, in 1928, of which he became President. He died in his city, on February 14, 1932, aged 72.

==History==
The collaboration began in 1928, when [[Vehbi Koç]] was assigned as Ford dealer in [[Ankara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford dünyasının en kalitelisi oldu yeni projeleri almakta zorlanmadı|url=http://otomobil.milliyet.com.tr/ford-dunyasinin-en-kalitelisi-oldu-yeni-projeleri-almakta-zorlanmadi/otonostalji/haberdetay/22.04.2012/1531579/default.htm|publisher=Milliyet|date=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the Turkish national assembly granted to Ford the right to install a local assembly operation in a free zone located in Istanbul's port area. Limited numbers of vehicles were assembled there until 1934, when these activities were suspended.&lt;ref&gt;Odin, L.C. ''World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production''. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, the foundation of the '''Otosan''' factory was held in [[Istanbul]], and in 1960 the [[Ford Consul]] was the first model to be produced at the plant, followed by the [[Ford Thames 300E|Thames]] and the [[Ford Thames 400E|Thames Trader]] van.&lt;ref name="tarihce"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tarihçe|url=http://www.fordotosan.com.tr/tarihce.htm|publisher=Ford Otosan|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, the D1210 truck was added to production, and in 1966, the [[Anadol]], the first mass-production passenger vehicle developed in Turkey. In 1967, the [[Ford Transit]] also began production and in 1973, the Anadol STC-16, the first sports car developed in Turkey.

In 1977, the company signed a license agreement with Ford and the company's name was changed to '''Ford Otosan'''. In 1979, took place the groundbreaking ceremony for a new factory in [[İnönü, Eskişehir]], which began production of the [[Ford Cargo]] in 1983.&lt;ref name="2009_report"/&gt; Also that year, Ford increased its share of ownership in the company to 30 percent.&lt;ref name="tarihce"/&gt; In 1985, the [[Ford Taunus TC#Turkey|Ford Taunus]] begins production at the Istanbul plant, and in 1986 the official opening ceremony for the İnönü engine plant is held.

In 1992, the newer [[Ford Transit]] was put into production, and in 1993 the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] replaced the Ford Taunus on the production lines.&lt;ref name="tarihce"/&gt; In 1997, Ford further increased its share in the company to 41 percent, becoming equal partner with Koç Holding in the joint venture. In 1998, the groundbreaking ceremony was held for the new factory in [[Gölcük, Kocaeli]], that became operational in 2001, replacing the Istanbul facility. It is aimed mainly at commercial vehicle production, and manufactures the [[Ford Transit]] and the [[Ford Transit Connect]], both models being marketed worldwide. In 2003, the company launched a new generation of the Ford Cargo heavy-duty truck.&lt;ref name="investor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Investor Presentation March 2012|url=http://www.fordotosan.com.tr/downloads/yatirimciiliskileri/Investor%20Presentation%20March%202012.pdf|publisher=Ford Otosan|date=26 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905013321/http://www.fordotosan.com.tr/downloads/yatirimciiliskileri/Investor%20Presentation%20March%202012.pdf|archivedate=5 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Ford revealed its new version of the [[Ford Transit|Transit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Reveals All-New Global Transit and Transit Connect Commercial Vehicles at ‘Go Further’ Event|url=http://media.ford.com/news/fordrevealsallnewglobaltransitandtransitconnectcommercialvehiclesatgofurtherevent.htm|publisher=Ford Motor Company|date=6 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123082752/http://media.ford.com/news/fordrevealsallnewglobaltransitandtransitconnectcommercialvehiclesatgofurtherevent.htm|archivedate=23 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in January 2013 the new Cargo heavy truck was unveiled.&lt;ref name="cargo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford’s Turkish designed heavy truck unveiled|url=http://www.invest.gov.tr/en-US/infocenter/news/Pages/280113-ford-turkish-designed-heavy-truck-hits-markets-worldwide.aspx|publisher=Invest in Turkey|date=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter was co-developed by Ford Otosan in partnership with

The '''genomics sector innovation network''' portal was developed to highlight and support the [[genomics]] sector in [[Ontario]] and was created by the [[Ontario Genomics Institute]].

== What is Genomics? ==

[[Genomics]] is the holistic, systematic, and high-throughput characterization of [[genome]]s—the full complement of [[DNA]] underlying the genetic make-up of a given organism. Though smaller genomes had been previously completely sequenced, the consideration of the possibility of doing so for the entire human genome crystallized the notion of a new paradigm for the life sciences, intended to enable and accelerate traditional hypothesis-driven research.

Genomics has since been generalized to capture the application of this approach to any and all aspects of life sciences, but many of these applications have also stimulated the coining of a much broader vocabulary of "[[omics]]" applications.

The growth of genomics and the resulting boom in technology development have created a tremendous global impact on our knowledge and understanding of the molecular basis of life. This impact ranges from drug and pesticide discovery to industrial enzymology, to crop and livestock cultivation, to environmental remediation, to natural resource management, and to criminal and civil law. This impact of these changes in technological underpinnings has also been reflected in other sectors focused more on societal implications, including public policy, education, journalism, fine arts, and entertainment.

== Genomics in Ontario ==
The genomics sector in Ontario consists of the individuals, institutions, and associations—a sub-set of the province's life-sciences industry—who are working:

* to create deeper understanding in the life sciences through genomics;
* to generate and maintain genomics resources (databases, instruments, reagents, software) for use in the public and private sectors;
* to translate this understanding and these resources into products which may be beneficial to society through the development of new products and services that can be distributed in the commercial marketplace.

This industry includes universities and private research institutions, individual and institutional investors, biotechnology, pharmaceutical and related companies, and the various public and private institutions devoted to servicing and supporting these enterprises.

There are more than 500 scientists conducting research in genomics located at 20 universities, research institutions, hospitals and government laboratories across the province. These individuals are generating genomics discoveries and innovations as well as using genomic tools and products.

'''Life Sciences Industry'''

* More than half the country's brand-name pharmaceutical and medical devices industries and almost half the medical biotechnology industry are located in Ontario.
* Ontario is North America's 3rd largest regional concentration of biotechnology firms and the 6th largest in revenues earned.
* The province's bio-medical sector employs more than 33,000 highly educated people and posted more than $1.0 billion in revenues in 2002.
* The biotechnology sector is built on world-class science and is involved in leading edge research in molecular biology and medical genetics.
* Ontario's pharmaceutical sector employs more than 15,000 talented people and includes global giants like GlaxoSmithKline, Amgen, Biogen, Genzyme, Eli Lilly, Pfizer and home-grown stars like Biovail Corporation, Apotex, and Patheon.
* Ontario has achieved worldwide recognition as a site for clinical trials because of its large and ethnically diverse patient population and a centrally managed public health-care system.
* Ontario's medical devices sector employs more than 19,000 highly educated people and comprises more than 500 manufacturing companies that include global subsidiaries as well as niche-driven domestic companies.
* Ontario's agricultural-biotech / [[bioproducts]] sector employs more than 6,000 people, including 700 scientists and invests $166 million annually in agricultural-food research at 12 world-class institutions.
* This sector works closely with the manufacturing sector in the production of bio-chemicals and bio-fuels.
* Ontario ranks in the top three jurisdictions in North America in terms of workforce and R&amp;D expenditures in the agricultural-biotechnology sector.

'''Global labor arbitrage''' is an economic phenomenon where, as a result of the removal of or disintegration of [[Trade barrier|barriers]] to [[international trade]], jobs move to nations where labor and the cost of doing business (such as [[Environmental law|environmental regulations]]) is inexpensive and/or impoverished labor moves to nations with higher paying jobs.&lt;ref name=Whitney&gt;The "global labor arbitrage" phenomenon has been described by economist [[Stephen S. Roach]]. See Mike Whitney, [http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/147390483.html "Labor arbitrage,"] ''Entrepreneur'', June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two common barriers to international trade are [[tariff]]s (politically imposed) and the costs of transporting goods across oceans.  With the advent of the [[Internet]], the decrease of the costs of [[telecommunications]], and the possibility of near-instantaneous document transfer, the barriers to the trade of intellectual work product, which is essentially, any kind of work that can be performed on a computer (such as [[computer programming]]) or that makes use of a college education, have been greatly reduced.

Often, a prosperous nation (such as the [[United States]]) will remove its barriers to international trade, integrating its [[labor market]] with those of nations with a lower cost of labor (such as [[India]], [[China]], and [[Mexico]]), resulting in a shifting of jobs from the prosperous nation to the developing one. The end result is an increase in the supply of labor relative to the demand for labor, which means a decrease in costs and a decrease in wages.

==Forms of global labor arbitrage==
Global labor arbitrage can take many forms, including but not limited to:

===Foreign outsourcing===
{{main|Offshore outsourcing}}

Capital moves to nations with cheap labor, lower taxes and or fewer environmental regulations or other costs of doing business for the purpose of producing goods and services for export to other markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miszczynski|first=Milosz|date=2016-06-22|title=Labour arbitrage: the lifecycle of a global production node|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JOE-04-2016-0009|journal=Journal of Organizational Ethnography|volume=5|issue=2|pages=106–122|doi=10.1108/JOE-04-2016-0009|issn=2046-6749}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classic example is the case of a factory or office closing in Nation A and then moving to Nation B for the purpose of producing goods or services at lower labor costs for export back to Nation A's market. This can result in layoffs for workers in Nation A. For example, in the United States, the amount of manufacturing jobs has decreased while the importation of manufactured goods from other nations has increased (along with the United States' trade deficit). These trends are now affecting the service sector as well.&lt;ref&gt;Nadeem, S (2009) [http://nadeem.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2010/04/Nadeem_Global-Networks.pdf "The Uses and Abuses of Time: Globalization and Time Arbitrage in India’s Outsourcing Industries,"] ''[[Global Networks]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importation of foreign labor using work visas===
Labor, often skilled and educated, moves to a nation on a temporary or permanent basis.  This has the effect of increasing the supply of labor in that nation's market.

This type of labor importation may be advantageous. According to the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA), a registered [[political action committee]],&lt;ref name="Open Secrets NVCA"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Venture Capital Assn|url=https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00150367|publisher=[[Center for Responsive Politics]]|accessdate=8 June 2015|quote=FEC Committee ID: C00150367}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 25% of all [[Startup company|startups]] responding to an NVCA survey, in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] of the US in the last 15 years were "immigrant-founded" (most likely former or current [[H-1B]]s).&lt;ref name = NFAP&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Stuart|title=American Made:  The Impact of Immigrant Entrepreneurs and Professionals on U.S. Competitiveness|url=http://www.nfap.com/researchactivities/studies/immigrant_entreprenuers_professionals_november_2006.pdf|publisher=National Venture Capital Association|accessdate=22 July 2012|author2=Michaela Platzer}}&lt;/ref&gt; 40% of all publicly traded and venture founded companies in high tech manufacturing were started by immigrants. These account for more than half of all jobs in this sector.

{{Quote box
 |quote  = To conduct the research, we examined the Thomson Financial database of all publicly traded venture-backed companies founded since 1970. After eliminating those that had merged, been acquired, or were otherwise no longer publicly traded (or in business), we used public records, Internet research, e-mails, and phone calls to identify the nativity of the founders for the nearly 900 remaining companies.4 The companies on our final list of immigrant-founded U.S. publicly traded venture-backed companies had at least one immigrant founder.
 |source = National Venture Capital Association, ''American Made:  The Impact of Immigrant Entrepreneurs and Professionals on U.S. Competitiveness'', Stuart Anderson and Micheala Platzer, Undated.&lt;ref name = NFAP/&gt;
  |align  = none
}}

Conversely, the NVCA "American Made," publication makes little mention of US born co-founders, makes an errant claim that Intel has an immigrant founder,&lt;ref name="Grove Not a Founder"/&gt; resulting in a faulty claim of the following companies employing more than 245,000 people in 2005:&lt;ref name = NFAP/&gt;
* [[Intel]] (co-founders: [[Gordon Moore]]-US, [[Robert Noyce]]-US)
* [[Sun Microsystems|Sun Microsystems (1982-2010)]] (co-founders: [[Vinod Khosla]]-India, [[Andy Bechtolsheim]]-Germany, [[Bill Joy]]-US, [[Scott McNealy]]-US)
* [[Google]] (co-founders: [[Larry Page]]-US, [[Sergey Brin]]-Russia)
* [[Yahoo!]] (co-founders: [[David Filo]]-US, [[Jerry Yan]]-Taiwan)
* [[eBay]] (founder: [[Pierre Omidyar]]-France)

Previous studies authored by Stuart Anderson, of the National Foundation for American Policy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.nfap.com/about/biographies/|work=Biographies|publisher=National Foundation for American Policy|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  had been careful to make the distinction of, "...founded or co-founded..." whereas the National Venture Capital Association uses the term, "immigrant-founded" 55 times in its 39-page document. The publication's data tables disclose only the names of "immigrant-born founder or cofounder", American born co-founders, and the number of American co-founders, are omitted.&lt;ref name = NFAP/&gt; Additionally, according to [[Intel]] Corporation (99,900 employees), Hungarian born CEO [[Andy Grove]] was not an Intel co-founder.&lt;ref name="Grove Not a Founder"&gt;{{cite web|title=Intel Facts|url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/company-overview/company-facts.html|work=Answers to our most frequent questions|publisher=[[Intel]]|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration===
Impoverished labor moves towards capital in prosperous nations.  This tends to increase the supply of labor relative to capital in the prosperous nations and potentially decreases wages, according to the laws of supply and demand (of and for labor). However, this decrease can be offset by job creation due to talented immigrants, as discussed in the last section.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3948">'''Hunter Fraud Score''' is a rating score launched locally in [[India]] by [[Credit rating agency]], [[Experian]], to detect fraud in credit applications to banks and insurance companies and help them lower their losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.experian.co.uk/identity-and-fraud/fraud-prevention/hunter.html|title=Prevent Application Fraud {{!}} Identity &amp; Fraud {{!}} Experian UK|website=www.experian.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key features ==
* Screening data at first level and to identity inconsistencies
* More the data is found, more are the chances of fraud level
* Data sources are used which include intelligence for smart detection
* Prioritising investigations depending upon fraud level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/experian-india-launches-new-fraud-solution-for-banking-and-insurance/articleshow/51992468.cms|title=Experian India launches new fraud solution for banking and insurance - The Economic Times|newspaper=The Economic Times|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Closed user group (CUG)'''

Presently, [[Experian]] maintains a network of 47 banks and 15 life insurer companies as a part of the CUG, that covers 50 per cent of the retail banking applications whose data is verified timely. With increase in these numbers, it can become a more complicated and secured database.

== Methodology ==
There are various criteria based on which information is matched in the loan application from different data sources and inconsistencies after that are identified.The company has some sophisticated analytical solutions which allows it to create an advanced analytical approach, to predict and calculate some authentic score that can help banks lower their losses. A data repository has been created to collect the data of all the past customers in addition to their [[Know your customer|KYC]] norms data, on which data mining is performed to filter out the useful minute details and extrapolate the user's data. The solution has some customised rules to analyse different data sources to highlight inconsistencies and discrepancies so that it can match with the known fraud data. The results calculate the level of fraud risk and any application if found suspicious is moved into a special investigation tool to take further action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mortgagestrategy.co.uk/issues/18-february-2013/the-war-on-fraud/|title=The war on fraud - Mortgage Strategy|date=2013-02-18|newspaper=Mortgage Strategy|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isha Johansen is the owner and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[Sierra Leone National Premier League]] club [[F.C. Johansen]].

==Early life and family==
Isha Johansen was born as Isha Tejan-Cole in [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]], into the Tejan-Cole family, who are of [[Oku people (Sierra Leone)|Aku]] or [[Sierra Leone Creole|Creole]] descent. She was immersed in football from the very beginning, as her father co-founded [[East End Lions F.C.]] in Freetown.&lt;ref name=IBT&gt;{{cite news |title=Sierra Leone's FA president Isha Johansen: Meet Africa's most powerful woman in football |author=Lydia Smith |newspaper=[[International Business Times]] |date=November 21, 2015 |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/sierra-leones-fa-president-isha-johansen-meet-africas-most-powerful-woman-football-1529757}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father took her to see football matches, and she played football with her brothers and their friends.

She was educated at a convent school in Freeport and a boarding school in [[Yeovil]], England.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news |title=Sierra Leone's Isha Johansen blazes trail amid tragedy and infighting |author=Anna Kessel |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=January 24, 2015 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/24/sierra-leone-isha-johansen-ebola-sexism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was raised in a religious [[Muslim]] family. She is married to the [[Norway|Norwegian]] Consul in Sierra Leone, Arne Birger Johansen.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;

==Football==
Isha Johansen founded her own football club, [[F.C. Johansen]], in 2004.&lt;ref name=IBT/&gt; The club was started with the objective of giving guidance and opportunities to children whose lives had been disrupted by the recent [[Sierra Leone Civil War]] (1991-2002).&lt;ref name=IBT/&gt; It began playing in Division One in 2011 and was promoted to the Premier League the following year.

Johansen was elected president of the Sierra Leone Football Association (SLFA) unopposed on 3 August 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africayoungvoices.com/2013/08/isha-johansen-becomes-first-woman-slfa-president/|title=ISHA JOHANSEN  becomes first woman SLFA President|work=africayoungvoices.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; after her main opponent, former Sierra Leone international footballer [[Mohamed Kallon]] was disqualified by the Sierra Leone Football Executive committee for not meeting the SLFA [[residency (domicile)|residency]] requirement in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/sports/summer/football/1015306-fresh-turmoil-in-sierra-leone-football-elections-as-former-player-kallon-disqualified|title=Fresh turmoil in Sierra Leone football elections as former player Kallon disqualified|work=insidethegames.biz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201308010912.html|title=allAfrica.com: Sierra Leone: Kallon, Rodney React to SLFA Disqualification|work=allAfrica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23549250|title=BBC Sport - Fifa endorses decision to ban Kallon from SLFA election|author=Mohamed Fajah Barrie|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kallon appealed his disqualification, but the [[FIFA]] delegation to Freetown confirmed the disqualifications of Kallon and two other candidates
(for links to gambling),&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; so Johansen was unopposed.&lt;ref name="mohamedfajahbarrie"/&gt; When [[Sepp Blatter]] was pressured to step down as head of FIFA, Johansen was touted as a possible successor in the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/03/football/fifa-sepp-blatter-football-isa-johansen/ |title=FIFA elections: Should football elect a woman to replace Sepp Blatter? |author=James Masters |date=February 4, 2016 |publisher=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurosport.com/football/why-can-t-isha-johansen-be-fifa-s-first-female-president_sto4993593/story.shtml |title=Why can't Isha Johansen be FIFA's first female president? |author=Desmond Kane |date=November 18, 2015 |publisher=[[Eurosport]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also started the annual African International Youth Tournament in 2009.&lt;ref name=Ventures/&gt;

On 7 September 2016, SLFA President Isha Johansen, Vice President Brima Kamara and Secretary General Christopher Kamara were jailed by the Anti-corruption Commission for failing to provide reports regarding the SLFA's financial statements and the use of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-leone-football-corruption-idUKKCN11E02I |title=Sierra Leone Football Association officials arrested by anti-graft agency |author= Umaru Fofana |date=8 September 2016 |agency=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trio were released after posting bail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espnfc.us/sierra-leone/story/2946073/top-sierra-leone-fa-officials-spend-night-in-jail-in-corruption-investigation |title=Top Sierra Leone FA officials spend night in jail in corruption investigation |date=8 September 2016 |agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; FIFA defended the SLFA in a letter, stating, "FIFA has no reason to suspect there has been misuse of funds that FIFA has provided to the SLFA", having audited the SLFA's accounts earlier in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37432190 |title=Fifa backs Sierra Leone FA in use of funds |date=21 September 2016 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is the youngest person ever to be appointed editor of the ''Weekly'', which was then, per capita, the largest-selling magazine in the world.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Buttrose was a panelist on the [[Network Ten]] morning program ''[[Studio 10]]'' from 2013 until 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/ita-buttrose-still-bringing-it-at-71/story-e6frfmyi-1226748976523 "Ita Buttrose still bringing it in at 71"], ''News.com.au'' (Australia), 29 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Buttrose was born at [[Potts Point]], Sydney,&lt;ref name="TalkingHeads"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ita Buttrose|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/talkingheads/txt/s2186115.htm|website=[[Talking Heads (Australian TV series)|Talking Heads]]|publisher=ABC|accessdate=26 November 2015|date=17 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and named after her maternal grandmother, Ita Clare Rodgers (née Rosenthal). She was raised as a Catholic by her parents.&lt;ref&gt;Pitt, Helen. (10 April 2011). "Girl talk: Cover story". ''[[The Sun-Herald]]'', Sydney. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Buttrose's father, Charles Oswald, was a journalist and at one time the editor of ''[[The Daily Mirror (Sydney)|The Daily Mirror]]'' in Sydney. By her own account she had decided on a career in journalism at the age of 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s1137508.htm|title=''Enough Rope'', 21 June 2004, interview transcript|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buttrose spent her first five years in [[New York City]] when her father was the New York correspondent for ''[[The Daily Mirror (Australia)|The Daily Mirror]]''.&lt;ref name="brisbanetimes.com.au"&gt;[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/lifestyle/people/ita-buttrose-on-kickstarting-a-sexual-revolution-20110411-1d9zg.html Helen Pitt, "Ita Buttrose on kick-starting a sexual revolution", ''Brisbane Times'', 11 April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The family returned to Australia in 1949 and settled in the harbourside suburb of [[Vaucluse, New South Wales|Vaucluse]]. Her parents divorced during her teens, after 25 years of marriage, and details of her father's private life were printed in the tabloid press, causing considerable anguish to her mother. Buttrose briefly attended a private school but because her father could not afford the fees she was then moved to a public school. She completed her secondary education at Dover Heights Home Science High School, leaving at 15 to begin her career.&lt;ref name="TalkingHeads"/&gt; She started her career at [[Australian Consolidated Press]], owned by the Packer family, working as a copy girl at the ''[[Australian Women's Weekly]]'', then became a cadet journalist on ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Sunday Telegraph]]'' in Sydney. Her first byline came in 1959 when the 17-year-old covered the Australian tour by [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra]].&lt;ref name="brisbanetimes.com.au"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heaney"&gt;{{cite news|last=Heaney|first=Claire|title=Women to take poll position|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/women-to-take-poll-position-for-survey/story-fn7j19iv-1226149384296|accessdate=24 April 2012|newspaper=Herald Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
At 21 years of age, Buttrose married architect Alasdair "Mac" Macdonald and had two children. She was appointed women's editor of the ''Telegraph'' at just 23 years old. In 1966 she won a racetrack fashion contest run by a rival newspaper, for which the first prize was an overseas trip, including a visit to [[Expo 67]] in Montreal. Buttrose and her husband then stopped in England in 1967 where she worked for a time on the British national magazine ''[[Woman's Own]]'' before giving birth to her first child, a daughter, Kate.&lt;ref name="TalkingHeads"/&gt; It was after her daughter's birth that she received a [[telegram]] from [[Sir Frank Packer]], head of Australian Consolidated Press, offering her back her former job as women's editor at the ''Telegraph''. The family then returned to Australia.

In 1971 Buttrose was chosen as founding editor of a new Australian women's magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australianoftheyear.org.au/honour-roll/#browse:view=fullView&amp;recipientID=937 ''Australian of the Year 2013'', www.australianoftheyear.org.au] Retrieved on 24 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  This was originally to have been an Australian edition of the renowned American magazine ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', but the deal fell through after [[William Randolph Hearst|Hearst]] Magazines sold the ''Cosmopolitan'' rights to longtime Packer rivals [[Fairfax Media|Fairfax]], so Packer and Buttrose set about creating a new publication, dubbed ''[[Cleo (magazine)|Cleo]]'', which they launched in 1972, several months ahead of its rival. ''Cleo'' was an instant hit, selling its entire original print run in just two days; the magazine broke new ground in Australian mainstream publishing, featuring the first nude male [[centrefold]] (actor [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]]) and frank articles on female sexuality and other topics, leading to the inclusion of the first sealed section in an Australian magazine. During the early months of the magazine, Buttrose became pregnant with her second child, Ben, but with the grudging support of the Packers she worked through her pregnancy; an unusual feat for that time as it was still common for women to have to give up work permanently after they became pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;

Buttrose edited ''Cleo'' until 1975, when she was appointed editor of the Packers' flagship magazine, ''[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]'' (1975–76), then she became editor-in-chief of both publications from 1976–78, before being appointed Publisher of Australian Consolidated Press Women's Division from 1978–81. In 1981 she left the Packers after their rival [[Rupert Murdoch]] offered her the job of Editor-in-Chief of the ''Daily Telegraph'' and ''Sunday Telegraph'' in 1981, making her the first female editor of a major metropolitan newspaper in Australia, a position she held until 1984; she was also appointed to the board of [[News Limited]]. She made frequent appearances on radio and TV and in 1980, her media prominence led to her becoming the subject of the song "[[Ita (song)|Ita]]", recorded by rock band [[Cold Chisel]], which was included on their successful ''[[East (Cold Chisel album)|East]]'' album.

Buttrose was the chairperson of the National Advisory Committee on AIDS (NACAIDS) from 1984 until 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Buttrose, Ita (1942–)|journal=Trove | publication-date=2008|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-487813|accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion, she appeared personally in a nationwide TV campaign to explain that ''donating'' blood at a blood bank did not pose a risk of catching AIDS (the fear of which had caused a significant drop in donations).

Instantly recognisable by her slight lisp, cultured mode of speech and immaculate appearance, Buttrose became a household name in the 1970s and 1980s, and she was frequently parodied by Australian TV comedians including [[Paul Hogan]] and [[Jane Turner]]. After her stint with News Limited, Buttrose founded her own publishing company, Capricorn Publishing, and launched her own magazine, ''Ita'', but this eventually folded, and she launched a new company, The Good Life Publishing Company, which in 2005 published ''bark!'', a lifestyle magazine aimed at dog owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3507369|title=National Library of Australia catalogue: Bark!|publisher=National Library of Australia|accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Television ===

On 9 June 2013 at 71 years of age, Buttrose joined [[Network Ten]] where she hosted morning program ''[[Studio 10]]'' two mornings a week for the station alongside [[Joe Hildebrand]], [[Sarah Harris (journalist)|Sarah Harris]], [[Denise Drysdale]] and [[Jessica Rowe]]. The show premiered in late 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/national/ita-buttrose-joins-tens-morning-show/story-e6frfku9-1226660775254 Ita Buttrose joins Ten's morning show], news.com.au, 9 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, 2016 saw Buttrose reduce her appearances on the program to just twice a week to spend more time with her grandchildren.

Prior to joining [[Network Ten]], Buttrose was a regular commentator on the [[Nine Network]] breakfast show ''[[Today (Australian TV program)|Today]]'' and was at one point considered to replace [[Kerri-Anne Kennerley]] in the network's morning slot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/nine-wants-an-early-ita-buttrose-for-kerri-anne-kennerleys-mornng-show/story-e6frewz0-1226173492155?nk=4f709d0e67be4f3e689f87bf3d801737 Nine wants an early Ita Buttrose for Kerri Anne Kennerleys morning slot ], news.com.au, 22 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
Buttrose was also a regular on [[Beauty and the Beast (talk show)|''Beauty and the Beast'']] in the 1990s and early 2000s.
[[File:Ita Buttrose (11024358813).jpg|thumb|Ita Buttrose at the premiere of ''[[Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues]]'']]

In April 2018, Buttrose resigned as panelist on ''[[Studio 10]]'' to focus on other parts of her life, including spending more time with her grandchildren and writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/morning-shows/ita-buttrose-to-depart-studio-10-tomorrow-reports/news-story/1a3d76973e50f1336a5994747c67e576|title=Ita Buttrose to depart Studio 10|work=NewsComAu|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since leaving [[Network Ten]], Buttrose has appeared on [[The Morning Show (TV program)|''The Morning Show'']] on the Seven Network and filled in for [[Sonia Kruger]] on ''[[Today Extra]]'' on the [[Nine Network]].

===''Paper Giants''===
In April 2011, Buttrose and ''Cleo'' were the subject of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC-TV]] two-part [[telemovie]] ''[[Paper Giants: The Birth of Cleo]]'', starring [[Asher Keddie]] as Buttrose, [[Rob Carlton]] as Kerry Packer and [[Tony Barry]] as Frank Packer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1724700/ IMDb – ''Paper Giants: The Birth of Cleo'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1975, While editing the ''Women's Weekly'' Buttrose's first marriage to Alasdair "Mac" Macdonald broke down and the couple divorced in 1976. Later she met Peter Sawyer and they married in 1979. By her own account it was "not a very happy marriage"; Sawyer left in 1980 and they subsequently divorced.&lt;ref name="TalkingHeads"/&gt;

Buttrose cared for her father after he was diagnosed with [[vascular dementia]], he passed away in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Alzheimer's: the complete Australian guide to the management and prevention of Alzheimer's|last=Martins|first=Ralph|last2=Ragg|first2=Mark|publisher=Pan Macmillan Australia|year=2013|isbn=9781742611983|location=Sydney|pages=ix|chapter=Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2007 book ''Who Killed Channel Nine?'', former Nine Network producer [[Gerald Stone]] claimed that Buttrose and Kerry Packer conducted a private but intense affair during Buttrose's tenure on ''Cleo'' and that Packer reportedly even offered to marry her, but she rejected the idea and they split after a "blazing row". Buttrose herself has repeatedly declined to comment on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/sydney-nsw/itas-volatile-affair-with-packer/story-e6freuzi-1111113909532 Sharri Markson and Sarah Blake, "Ita's volatile affair with Packer", ''Sydney Daily Telegraph'', 8 July 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Johnny Hiromu Kitagawa'''|ジャニー喜多川|Janī Kitagawa|born {{Nihongo|John Hiromu Kitagawa|喜多川 擴|Kitagawa Hiromu}} on October 23, 1928}}, is a Japanese-American businessman and talent manager. He is the founder and president of [[Johnny &amp; Associates]], a production agency for numerous popular [[boy band]]s in Japan. Kitagawa assembled, produced and managed more than a dozen popular bands, including [[Tanokin Trio]], [[Hey! Say! JUMP]], [[SMAP]], [[Arashi]], [[Kanjani8]], [[V6 (band)|V6]], [[News (band)|NEWS]] and [[KAT-TUN]]. Kitagawa's influence has spread beyond music to the realms of theatre and television. Regarded as one of the most powerful figures in the Japanese entertainment industry, he has held a virtual monopoly on the creation of boy bands in Japan for more than 40 years.&lt;ref name = "Jpop" /&gt;

From 1988 to 2000, Kitagawa was the subject of a number of claims that he had taken advantage of his position to engage in improper sexual relationships with boys under contract to his talent agency. Kitagawa denied these claims, and in 2002 was awarded an 8.8 million [[Japanese yen|yen]] judgment against the magazine that had published such allegations. An appeal by the magazine followed, resulting in a partial reversal of the judgment. The Tokyo High Court reduced the damages to ¥1.2 million, concluding that the reports of drinking and smoking were defamatory but that the allegations of sexual exploitation of adolescent boys by Johnny Kitagawa were true. A 2004 appeal to the Supreme Court by Kitagawa was rejected.

==Early life==
Born in 1928 in [[Los Angeles, California]], United States, Kitagawa returned with his family to Japan in 1933. His father Taido was a Buddhist priest and was the third head  bishop of the [[Koyasan Buddhist Temple]] in [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles|Little Tokyo]] from 1924 to 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Kazahaya, Katsuichi. (1974) ''Koyasan Beikoku Betsuin 50 nen shi. pp. 138-9.''&lt;/ref&gt; Johnny went to America about 1949. In the early 1950s, he returned to Japan to work at the [[Embassy of the United States in Tokyo|United States Embassy]]. While walking through Tokyo's [[Yoyogi Park]] he encountered a group of boys playing baseball. He recruited them to form a singing group, acting as their manager. He named the group "[[Johnnys|The Johnnies]]".&lt;ref name = "Jpop" /&gt; The Johnnies achieved a measure of success by using a then-novel formula of mixing attractive performers singing popular music with coordinated dance routines.  The Johnnies were the first all-male pop group in Japan, and set the pattern that Kitagawa would follow with his subsequent acts.&lt;ref name = "Jpop" /&gt; Indeed, the term "Johnnies" would come to apply generically to any of the performers under Kitagawa's employ.&lt;ref name = "Jpop" /&gt;

==Major success==
In 1968, Kitagawa achieved wider success with a four-member boy band known as {{nihongo|[[Four Leaves]]|フォーリーブス|Fō Rībusu}}. The song and dance group met with success, as reflected by seven consecutive appearances on the annual invitation-only {{nihongo|[[Kōhaku Uta Gassen]]|紅白歌合戦|Red White Song Battle}}, beginning in 1970.&lt;ref name ="four"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japan-zone.com/news/2009/01/19/four_leaves_taabo_battling_cancer.shtml|title=Four Leaves Taabo battling cancer|accessdate=5 Feb 2009|work=Japan Zone|date=19 Jan 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four Leaves performed together for ten years before disbanding in 1978. Later, in 2002, Kitagawa oversaw the band's reunion.&lt;ref name ="four" /&gt; Kitagawa went on to assemble, produce and manage many of the top all-male bands in the country, including groups such as [[Hey! Say! JUMP]], [[SMAP]], [[Tokio (band)|Tokio]], [[V6 (band)|V6]], [[Arashi]], [[Tackey &amp; Tsubasa]], [[Kanjani8]], [[News (band)|NEWS]], [[KAT-TUN]], [[KinKi Kids]] and among many others.&lt;ref name = "Jpop" &gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/aug/21/popandrock3|title=J-Pop's dream factory|author=Chris Campion|work=[[The Guardian]] Music Observer Monthly|publicationdate=21 Aug 2005|accessdate=2 Feb 2009 | location=London | date=2005-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kitagawa was able to expand his sphere of influence to include television, as his performers regularly appear on television, with many appearing on their own variety programs.  They also regularly act as pitchmen for commercial products, and appear in movies.&lt;ref name = "starmaker" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "LAT" /&gt; The success of Kitagawa's performers led to increased profitability, as Johnny &amp; Associates generated 2.9 billion yen in annual profits at the height of the boy band boom.&lt;ref name = "starmaker" /&gt; During 1997, performers belonging to the talent agency appeared in more than 40 television programs and another 40 commercials.&lt;ref name = "starmaker" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "tarnished" /&gt; The success of his company has made Kitagawa one of the richest men in Japan.&lt;ref name = "grim" /&gt;

==The formula==
Kitagawa repeatedly has employed a standard formula in the development and marketing of his acts.&lt;ref name = "Turning Japanese"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/11/turning-japanese-music-moguls|accessdate=23 Mar 2009|title=Turning Japanese: The seedy underworld of music moguls|work = [[The Guardian]]|author = Alex Hoban|date=11 Feb 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnny &amp; Associates holds open tryouts for potential performers. The production agency recruits boys as young as ten into a talent pool known as [[Johnny's Juniors]].&lt;ref name = "Jpop" /&gt; Successful applicants live in a company dormitory and attend a company-run school. They train to hone their showmanship in the form of singing, dancing and acting.&lt;ref name = "LAT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/28/entertainment/ca-nino28|accessdate=16 Nov 2010|work = [[The Los Angeles Times]]|author=Bruce Wallace|date=28 Jan 2007|title=The story is written on this actor's face}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kitagawa holds an annual summer festival known as "Johnny's Summary". {{quote box |width=25em | |align=right  | quote=I'm not very interested in records.

The junior members act as background dancers for the major acts to allow for name recognition prior to being launched as a separate group.&lt;ref name = "Jpop" /&gt; The members of the Juniors also appear in on "Hachi-ji da J", a weekly television variety show. Members sing, dance, and perform in comedic sketches as they further develop the skills to graduate to a major act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl19990915pb.html|accessdate=6 Feb 2009|work=[[The Japan Times]]|title=Young at heart, but never free of Johnny|date=15 Sep 1999|author=Phillip Brasor}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kitagawa's focus is on the development of his group as complete entertainers. Shonentai, for example, did not release a single until it had been together for more than seven years.&lt;ref name = "Billboard 96" /&gt; "I'm not very interested in records," Kitagawa said in a 1996 interview. "Once you release a record, you have to sell that record. You have to push one song only. You can't think of anything else. It's not good for the artist." &lt;ref name = "Billboard 96"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McClure |first1=Steve |year=1996 |title=You Look Like a Music Star |journal=Billboard |volume=108 |issue=35 |pages=76–80 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vwcEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=johnny+kitagawa&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=johnny+kitagawa&amp;f=false |issn=0006-2510 |publisher=Nielsen Business Media|accessdate = January 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once launched, Kitagawa has been known to use his established groups to induce television stations to report on his newer acts, and ensure favorable press coverage for his acts and himself.&lt;ref name = "LAT" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "grim"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6D9113EF937A25757C0A9669C8B63|accessdate=4 Feb 2009|date=14 Apr 2000|title=Lawmakers In Japan Hear Grim Sex Case|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Calvin Sims}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs that give unfavorable coverage do not receive interviews or television appearance from popular stars managed by Kitagawa.&lt;ref name = "tarnished" /&gt;
Kitagawa maintains a high degree of control over his acts,&lt;ref name = "Jpop" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Johnnies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20070916pb.html|accessdate=2 Feb 2009|author=Phillip Brasor|work= [[The Japan Times]]|date=16 Sep 2007|title=They're fey, maybe not gay, but anyway, the 'talent' are coming out to play}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the extent that their images do not appear on the company website.&lt;ref name= "Jpop" /&gt; Performers are expected to maintain a public image that is conducive to marketing to young women; as a result, members of bands produced by Kitagawa avoid public mention of their private lives.&lt;ref name = "Johnnies" /&gt; Kitagawa himself avoids the public spotlight as well. He rarely permits his photograph to be taken, and does not make public appearances with his groups.&lt;ref name = "Jpop" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Johnnies" /&gt;

==Sexual harassment claims and libel suit==
Rumors concerning Kitagawa and possible [[sexual harassment]] of the youth in his employ had surrounded the agency since 1988,&lt;ref name = "Secrets" /&gt; when {{nihongo|Koji Kita|北公次|''Kita Kōji''}}, a former member of Four Leaves, published a series of diaries under the title {{nihongo|''Hikaru Genji e''|光Genjiへ|To [[Hikaru Genji (band)|Hikaru Genji]]}}. Kita claimed that Kitagawa had used his position of influence over the group to make unwanted sexual advances towards the boys under contract to him.&lt;ref name = "Jpop" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "grim" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nihongo|Koji Kita|北公次|''Kita Kōji''}}, {{nihongo|''Hikaru Genji e''|光Genjiへ|}}, Publisher: {{nihongo|Data House|データハウス|''dēta hausu''}}, December 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Similar allegations were made in a book published in 1996 by Junya Hiramoto, a former member of another of Kitagawa's bands. Hiramoto alleged that he had seen Kitagawa force a boy to have sex with him in one of the talent agency's dormitories.&lt;ref name = "starmaker"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4011093,00.html|accessdate=4 Feb 2009|work=Kobe Observer|title=Japan's star-maker accused of sexually abusing boys|date=23 April 2000|author=Justin McCurry | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Later, in 1999, the weekly magazine {{nihongo|''[[Shukan Bunshun]]''|週刊文春|}} printed a ten-part series that detailed numerous allegations of sexual improprieties. The accusers were a dozen teenage boys who had been recruited into the Johnny &amp; Associates organization, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In addition, the series also accused Kitagawa of permitting minors in his employ to drink alcohol and smoke. The accusations prompted international newspaper coverage.&lt;ref name = "Jpop" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "tarnished"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/world/asia/013000japan-talent.html|title=In Japan, Tarnishing a Star Maker|accessdate=2 Feb 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|date = 30 Jan 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy resulted in Yoshihide Sakaue, a member of the [[Diet of Japan|Parliament]], holding a hearing on the matter in April, 2000.&lt;ref name = "grim" /&gt; Sakaue said that as a result of the media coverage, and in response to a request from a constituent, he wanted to examine whether government officials had properly investigated complaints about Kitagawa.&lt;ref name = "tarnished" /&gt; Officials of the National Police Agency acknowledged that they had investigated Kitagawa's agency, but had not determined that sexual harassment had occurred. Officials did indicate that Kitagawa's company was warned about permitting minors to use alcohol and smoke cigarettes.&lt;ref name ="grim" /&gt; The National Police and Welfare Ministry indicated that under the Ministry's understanding of the law, even if the allegations against Kitagawa were true, the acts could not be considered [[child abuse]] because Kitagawa was neither parent nor guardian to the boys in his employ.&lt;ref name ="grim" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Secrets" /&gt; In addition, officials testified that neither the boys nor their parents had pursued a criminal complaint against Kitagawa.&lt;ref name ="grim" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Secrets" /&gt; Kitagawa denied any wrongdoing, and his attorney characterized the claims as being from disgruntled former employees voicing discontent.&lt;ref name = "grim" /&gt;  Kitagawa sued ''Shukan Bunshun'' for [[defamation|libel]].&lt;ref name = "starmaker" /&gt; Other than ''Shukan Bunshun'', none of the major Japanese media covered the story of the allegations against Kitagawa, the hearing in Parliament, or the Kitagawa lawsuit. ''[[The New York Times]]'' attributed this lack of coverage to Kitagawa's influence over the popular [[News media|media]].&lt;ref name = "grim" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Secrets" /&gt; Once ''Shukan Bunshun'' began publication of the series, [[Johnny &amp; Associates]] denied the magazine, and the other media owned by its parent organization, access to any of its performers.&lt;ref name = "tarnished" /&gt;

After protracted litigation, in 2002 the [[Tokyo District Court]] awarded Kitagawa an 8.8 million yen judgment against ''Shukan Bunshun'', finding that the articles defamed him.&lt;ref name = "Jpop" /&gt; ''[[Shukan Bunshun]]'' appealed the ruling. In a partial reversal of the district court, the [[Tokyo High Court]] in 2003 ruled that the ''Shukan Bunshun'' series did in fact defame Kitagawa; however, it ruled that the defamatory content of the articles was limited to the allegations that Kitagawa had provided minors with alcohol and tobacco products. The court found that the ''Shukan Bunshun'' had sufficient reason to accept as trustworthy, and publish, the sexual allegations by Kitagawa's former clients. Kitagawa appealed this decision to the [[Supreme Court of Japan|Supreme Court]], but in 2004 it rejected his appeal.&lt;ref name ="Secrets"&gt;{{cite book|title=Secrets, Sex, and Spectacle: The Rules of Scandal in Japan and the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A9CDvNs35ooC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Secrets,+Sex,+and+Spectacle:+The+Rules+of+Scandal+in+Japan+and+the+United+States|ISBN=0-226-89408-8|author=Mark D.

==Post-litigation activities==
In 2006, the boy band [[KAT-TUN]] was promoted to major band status and has all their 20 singles, DVD releases and 6 studio albums to date reach #1 on the prestigious [[Oricon]] music charts; the Japanese equivalent of the American [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] music charts. In 2007, temporary [[Johnny's Jr]]. group, [[Hey! Say! JUMP|Hey!

The '''Jupiter Factory''' ({{lang-ru|Юпитер or завод Юпитер}}) is an abandoned factory located in the outskirts of Pripyat in the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]] ([[Ukraine]]). Officially a manufacturer of cassette recorders and components for home appliances, the factory secretly produced semiconductor components for the military, and had test workshops for robotic systems.

==History==
As many university-educated people lived in Pripyat, the [[Soviet Union]] decided to build a factory in the outskirts to employ part of those people. This factory became the second employer in the area after the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]]. The factory opened in 1980 and employed around 3500 people. Officially, Jupiter became a branch of the Kiev factory, ''Lighthouse'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://stalker.uz/novosti/pripyat-zavod-yupiter-novye-fakty.html  Припять. Завод "Юпитер" (НОВЫЕ ФАКТЫ)!]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://stalker-tour.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=55&amp;t=1238 завод "Юпитер"]&lt;/ref&gt; where they made cassette recorders and electronic components for home appliances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://zalaza.net/viewtopic.php?f=71&amp;t=10599 Завод "Юпитер"Припять]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neqo.be/Drupal/content/jupiter-factory?page=2 Jupiter Factory]&lt;/ref&gt;

But the reality was somewhat different. Production of tape and components for appliances was a smokescreen, and Jupiter secretly produced semiconductor components for the military industry. In laboratories and workshops were tested new materials and robotics department developed various robotic systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stalker.uz/galereya/nemnogo-tainy-zavoda-yupiterpripyat-zavod-yupiter-foto.html Немного тайны завода "Юпитер",(Припять. Завод “Юпитер” , фото)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time after the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in 1986 and the abandonment of Pripyat,&lt;ref&gt;[http://chernobylgallery.com/galleries/jupiter-factory/ Jupiter Factory]&lt;/ref&gt; some employees returned to Jupiter and the factory became a radiological laboratory for testing of various decontamination techniques and developing dosimetric instruments. The factory was still operating until 1996;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chernobylwel.com/cz/city.html Chernobyl Welcome]&lt;/ref&gt; today it is abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://englishrussia.com/2014/02/19/the-huge-factory-of-pripyat/#more-139082 The huge factory of Pripyat]&lt;/ref&gt; The level of [[radioactive contamination]] in some places remains several times higher than the safe level especially in the basement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chernobylproject.blogspot.com.es/2011/06/jupiter-revisited-radiation-and.html Jupiter revisited; Radiation and Contamination.

'''Leonardo Salvador Sarao, Sr.''' (April 13, 1921 &amp;ndash; July 31, 2001) was the founder and owner of the [[Sarao Motors]], a company known for designing, manufacturing and selling the [[jeepney]], the most popular mode of transportation in the [[Philippines]].  He is not the first person to alter the surplus [[Willys MB Jeep|jeeps]] left behind by the [[U.S. Army]] from [[World War II]],&lt;ref name=PUV&gt;Blueberry (2007-09-23).[http://phuvs.blogspot.com/2007/09/sarao-jeepney.html "Sarao Jeepney"]. Public Utility Vehicles. Retrieved on 2013-04-25.&lt;/ref&gt; but he saw them as a business opportunity for [[mass transportation]]. He redesigned the surplus jeeps to increase its functionality by extending the body to accommodate at least twice the number of passengers and by putting some railings at the back and top for extra passengers to cling to, and for cargoes.&lt;ref name=remarkable&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/cps/jeepney.html "Remarkable Philippine Jeepneys"].

Leonardo Sarao was awarded [[The Outstanding Filipino Award]] (TOFIL) in 1997 for [[Entrepreneurship]].  He started Sarao Motors from a borrowed [[Philippine peso|PHP]]700.  Though he only attained [[elementary education|Grade 6]] level of education because of [[poverty]], he was able to make the company grow into a multimillion [[Banknotes of the Philippine peso|peso]] [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]].

[[File:Made in Italy.png|thumb|right|300px|Made in Italy brand]]
'''Made in Italy''' is a merchandise mark indicating that a product is all planned, manufactured and packed in [[Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/decreti/09135d.htm Law 135, September 25th, 2009] camera.it&lt;/ref&gt; especially concerning the [[Italian design|design]], [[Italian fashion|fashion]], [[Italian cuisine|food]], manufacturing, craftsmanship, and engineering industries.

==History==
[[File:" 13 - ITALY- Alessi grill pan steak - Dressed - diciture MADE IN ITALY designed by Marcel Wanders for Alessi and Esselunga.jpg|thumb|A grill pan, with the label ''Made in Italy'', designed by [[Marcel Wanders]] for [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] and [[Esselunga]]]]
Made in Italy brand has been used since 1980 to indicate the international uniqueness of [[Italy]] in four traditional industries: [[fashion]], [[food]], [[furniture]] and [[mechanical engineering]] ([[automobiles]], [[industrial design]], [[machineries]] and [[shipbuilding]]), in [[Italian language|Italian]] also known as "Four A", ''Abbigliamento'' (clothes), ''Agroalimentare'' (food), ''Arredamento'' (furniture) and ''Automobili'' (automobiles). Italian products have often been associated with quality, high specialization and differentiation, elegance, and strong links to experienced and famous [[Italy|Italian]] industrial districts often connected with the concept of luxury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orizzonteitalia.com/en/ Orizzonte Italia]. orizzonteitalia.com&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1999, Made in Italy has begun to be protected by associations such as ''Istituto per la Tutela dei Produttori Italiani'' (Institute for the Protection of the Italian Manufacturers) and regulated by the [[Italy|Italian]] law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/made-in-italy_(Dizionario_di_Economia_e_Finanza)/ Made in Italy]. treccani.it&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itpi.it/istituto_en.htm Istituto per la Tutela dei Produttori Italiani]. itipi.it&lt;/ref&gt; 

In recent times the merchandise mark ''Made in Italy'' has become decisive for [[List of countries by exports|Italian exports]] and so common worldwide to be often considered as a separate product category. In January 2014, [[Google Cultural Institute]], in collaboration with the [[Italy|Italian]] government and the [[Italy|Italian]] Chamber of Commerce, launched an online project aimed to promote ''Made in Italy'' by using virtual showrooms about several famous [[Italy|Italian]] products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.it/internet/web/2014/01/22/google-madeinitaly-eccellenze-italiane-rete/ Made in Italy, Google mette le eccellenze italiane in Rete]. wired.it &lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==
In 2009, the Italian law ([http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/decreti/09135d.htm Law 135, September 25th, 2009 - Chamber of Deputies, Parliament of Italy]) stated that only products totally made in Italy (planning, manufacturing and packaging) are allowed to use the labels ''Made in Italy'', ''100% Made in Italy'', ''100% Italia'', ''tutto italiano'' in every language, with or without the [[flag of Italy]]. Each abuse is punished by the Italian law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leg16.camera.it/522?tema=92&amp;Made+in+Italy+e+lotta+alla+contraffazione Made in Italy e lotta alla contraffazione] leg16.camera.it&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared with "Made in Germany" ('all essential manufacturing steps') and "Made in the USA" ('all or virtually all'), Italian regulation is more restrictive ('totally') in determining what qualifies for the use of the "Made in Italy" label.&lt;ref&gt;Aichner, T. 2014. Country-of-origin marketing: A list of typical strategies with examples. Journal of Brand Management, 21(1): 81-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Italian companies, mostly owned by Chinese people resident in Italy or immigrate, have used [[Chinese people|Chinese]] labor to cut down on costs and still produce “Made in Italy” items.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/16/the-chinese-workers-who-assemble-designer-bags-in-tuscany The Chinese Workers Who Assemble Designer Bags in Tuscany:  Many companies are using inexpensive immigrant labor to manufacture handbags that bear the coveted “Made in Italy” label] D.

'''Mary Wells Lawrence''' (born '''Mary Georgene Berg''' on May 25, 1928 in [[Youngstown, Ohio]], [[United States]]) is a retired American advertising executive.  She was the founding president of '''Wells, Rich, Greene''',&lt;ref name="ElliottLegendNYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WRG"/&gt;  an [[advertising agency]] known for its creative work.&lt;ref name="ArchivesDukeUniversity"/&gt; Lawrence was the first female [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of a company listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].

==Education and early years==
In the late 1940s, Lawrence studied for two years at the [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], where she met industrial design student Burt Wells.  While there she became a member of [[Kappa Alpha Theta]].  In 1949, they married and moved to Youngstown, Ohio. She began her advertising career there in 1951, as a [[Copywriting|copywriter]] for McKelvey’s department store. She relocated to [[New York City]], where she studied [[theatre]] and [[drama]]. By 1952, she had become [[Macy's]] fashion [[Advertising management|advertising manager]]. She divorced Wells that year, only to remarry him in 1954. Lawrence worked as a copywriter and copy group head at [[McCann Erickson]] in 1953, later joining the Lennen &amp; Newell advertising agency's "[[Think tank|brain trust]]." In 1957, she began a seven-year tenure at Doyle Dane Bernbach (now [[DDB Worldwide]]). In her 2002 book, ''A Big Life in Advertising,'' Lawrence cited DDB partners [[James Edwin Doyle]], [[Maxwell Dane]], and [[William Bernbach]] as significant influences on her subsequent career.&lt;ref name="WhartonReview"/&gt;

==Family==
Lawrence had two daughters with Bert Wells, Pamela and Kathy.  She divorced Bert a second time in 1965, and married former [[Braniff Airways|Braniff International Airways]] president [[Harding Lawrence]] on November 25, 1967.&lt;ref name="Big Life"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Norwich"/&gt;  Mr. Lawrence had four children: sons Harding, Jr., who died in infancy, James B., State R.,and one daughter, Deborah. He died on February 16, 2002 at age 81 of pancreatic cancer.&lt;ref name="Gilpin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McMurtrey"/&gt;

==Jack Tinker and Partners and Braniff==
Lawrence went to work for Jack Tinker and his new advertising group, Jack Tinker and Partners.  The members of this revolutionary new think tank were dubbed "Tinker's Thinkers".  The "Thinkers" would create ad campaigns for other agencies at [[Interpublic]], a holding company of many US advertising firms. Lawrence had previously worked for Tinker at McCann-Erickson, and was excited to partner with him again. Her star rose in the advertising world &lt;ref name="WRG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilpin"/&gt; with the success of her advertising campaign for [[Braniff International Airways]], "The End of the Plain Plane".&lt;ref name="ModernistGirard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GirardSFMOMA"/&gt; She hired [[Alexander Girard]] as project designer, and designer [[Emilio Pucci]] to create new uniforms for the airline's flight attendants and crew. The campaign was lauded as critical to the airline's revolutionary turnaround.

==Wells Rich Greene==
Following the success of the Braniff campaign, Lawrence founded Wells Rich Greene on April 5, 1966, and became the agency's [[president]]. Partner Richard Rich acted as the agency's [[treasurer]], and Stewart Greene its [[Company secretary|secretary]].&lt;ref name="ElliottLegendNYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WRG"/&gt; Major WRG clients included [[American Motors]], [[Cadbury Schweppes]], [[IBM]], [[MCI Communications]], [[Pan American World Airways]], [[Trans World Airlines]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Nestlé Purina PetCare|Ralston Purina]], [[RC Cola]], and [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts]].&lt;ref name="ArchivesDukeUniversity"/&gt; Braniff remained a Wells Rich Greene client through 1968.

By 1969, Lawrence was reported to be the highest-paid executive in advertising. She was selected by U.S. Vice President [[Nelson Rockefeller]] to be a member of his [[Commission on Critical Choices for Americans]], and was also invited by U.S. President [[Gerald Ford]] to represent business at an Economic Summit in [[Washington, D.C.]]

After Lawrence stepped down as CEO in 1990, the agency was sold to Boulet Dru Dupuy Petit, and became known as Wells Rich Greene BDDP.&lt;ref name="ArchivesDukeUniversity"/&gt; The agency officially ceased operations in 1998, and donated its archive of print and television ads to [[Duke University]]'s John W. Hartman Center for Sales, Advertising and Marketing History.

'''Maurice Murray Watson''' (29 December 1893 – 8 June 1973) was a British solicitor in Hong Kong and [[unofficial member]] of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]].

==Biography==
Watson worked as an [[articled clerk]] from November 1910 to  A. Home, of 55 [[Gracechurch Street]], London and served in his office for four years. When the [[First World War]] broke out, he joined as private of the [[Inns of Court]] [[Officers' Training Corps]] on 8 November 1914 and later became the 2nd Lieutenant of the 11th Battalion of the [[South Staffordshire Regiment]]. After he was demobilised in 1919, he was admitted a solicitor in England in 1919 when he complied all the requirements but had not given four months' notice to the Registrar of the Law Society. The Law Society wrote to say they did not object to the application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=NEW SOLICITOR ENROLLED.|date=27 January 1921|newspaper=The Hong Kong Telegraph|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watson later moved to Hong Kong to practice as a solicitor of the Criminal Sessions Court by the acting [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Hong Kong|Chief Justice]] [[H. H. J. Gompertz]] on 27 January 1921. He worked for the firm Johnson, Stokes and Master. He was also head of many public companies, such as the chairman of the Thomson &amp; Co. Chartered Accountants, director of the Broadcast Relay Service (Hong Kong) Limited and the co-founder of the [[Swire Pacific Limited]] when it was incorporated in 1940. He also held many public offices such as secretary of the Dental Board and member of the Medical Board. He was also member of the [[Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce]].

In 1946, Watson was elected as the representative of the [[Justice of Peace|Unofficial Justices of the Peace]] to the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]]. During his office as an unofficial member of the Legislative Council, he voted for the Inland Revenue Bill 1947 which was heavily being criticised by the unofficials who opposed to income tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Taxation Without Representation: The History of Hong Kong's Troublingly Successful Tax System|first=Michael|last=Littlewood|year=2010|page=103|publisher=Hong Kong University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also agreed on the [[Hong Kong Governor|Governor]] [[Alexander Grantham]]'s modification on the [[Young Plan (Hong Kong)|Young Plan]] which abandoned the possibility of a municipal council but introducing elections into the Legislative Council, arguing that a municipal council should emerge by evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=329|title=The End of Empire: Dependencies Since 1948, Part 1: The West Indies, British Honduras, Hong Kong, Fiji, Cyprus, Gibraltar, and the Falklands, Volume 1|editor1-first=Frederick|editor1-last=Madden|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He resigned and succeeded by [[Dhun J. Ruttonjee]] on 20 March 1953.

== Early life and education==
Shamir was born in 1951 in [[Kibbutz]] Be’erot Yitzhak and relocated to [[Petah Tikva]] with his family upon turning five years old, where he was later raised and educated. In 1969, Shamir joined the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israel Defence Forces]] (IDF) as a Navigator in the [[69 Squadron (Israel)|69 Squadron]] ("Hammers") of the Israeli Air Force, and took part in the [[Yom Kippur War]]. After completing his military service, he pursued a BA in Management, Business Administration and Economics from [[Bar-Ilan University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/officerProfile?symbol=MISH.TA&amp;officerId=657079|title=Stock Quotes &amp; Company News {{!}} Reuters.com|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|website=U.S.|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career==
Shamir began working as an [[Insurance broker|Insurance Agent]] at Mivtach, a subsidiary of the Sahar Insurance Group. In 1981, at the age of 30, Shamir purchased 50% of the company's shares and changed its name to Mivtach Shamir Holdings Ltd. In 1992 Shamir went on to purchase the remaining shares of the company, thus becoming its sole owner and director. In the following years, Shamir sold the company's insurance business,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.themarker.com/magazine/1.2302699|title=מפת הקשרים של מאיר שמיר|work=TheMarker|access-date=2017-08-20|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt; turning it into an internationally active Israel-based investment company that invests mainly in technology and communications, real estate and industrial companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=MISH.TA|title=${Instrument_CompanyName} ${Instrument_Ric}  Company Profile {{!}} Reuters.com|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|website=U.S.|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Shamir's leadership the company's market value in the stock exchange grew from 20 million NIS (approx. $5.6&amp;nbsp;million) in 1992 to 830&amp;nbsp;million NIS (approx. $230&amp;nbsp;million) by Jun/2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tase.co.il/Heb/General/Company/Pages/companyHistoryData.aspx?subDataType=0&amp;companyID=000127&amp;shareID=00127019|title=אתר הבורסה – נתונים היסטורים|website=www.tase.co.il|language=he-il|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mivtach Shamir is a diverse and active company in Israel and around the world, investing in the fields of technology and communications, income-producing real estate and venture capital, with a special focus on medical, biotechnology and biotechnology companies. Some of the companies in which Mivtach Shamir has invested in include; Tnuva Food Corporation, [[Alony-Hetz]], [[Gilat Satellite Networks]], Teldor/Eldor, Solbar and Scitex, as well as the high-tech company Lipman Electronics (now VeriFone Israel), which deals with clearing and securing online money transfers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 2007 Mivtach Shamir invested $15&amp;nbsp;million in [[TVJ]] (Tower Vision Jersey), an Indian company. Two months later Mivtach Real Estate, which is a subsidiary of Mivtach Shamir, invested $13&amp;nbsp;million in commercial property and land in Chennai, India as part of an investment group that put $30&amp;nbsp;million into the development project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.streetdirectory.com/travel_guide/70389/india_properties/mivtach_real_estate_will_invest_13_million_in_chennai.html|title=Mivtach Real Estate Will Invest $13 Million in Chennai|website=www.streetdirectory.com|access-date=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the investment was to build offices, hotels, commercial centers and other complexes over 2.25&amp;nbsp;million sqm of the city. According to the signed agreement, in exchange for their investment, Mivtach would receive 32% of the project's shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3449845,00.html|title=Mivtach Shamir invests $13&amp;nbsp;million in Indian real estate|work=Ynetnews|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Milanka Karić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Миланка Карић; born September 15, 1957}}) is a politician in [[Serbia]]. She has served in the [[National Assembly of Serbia]] since 2012 as a member of the [[Strength of Serbia Movement]], a political party led by her husband [[Bogoljub Karić]].

==Early life and education==
Karić was born in [[Peć]], [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Kosovo and Mehotija]], in what was then the [[People's Republic of Serbia]] in the [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]]. She holds a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree from the [[University of Niš]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.otvoreniparlament.rs/poslanik/7913 MILANKA KARIĆ], Otvoreni Parlament, accessed 18 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career and philanthrophy==
The Karić family was one of the richest in Serbia during the 1990s. More recent reports suggest that their wealth and influence, though reduced, remain significant.&lt;ref&gt;"Serb businessman proposes Kosovo conference in Belgrade," ''Associated Press Newswires'', 17 May 1999; "Businessman reportedly wants to return to Serbia to "clear his name" in court," British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 18 April 2014 (Source: Vecernje novosti website, Belgrade, in Serbian 14 Apr 14).&lt;/ref&gt; Milanka Karić has been active in several of the family's business and philanthropic concerns, including serving as president of the Karić Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/vesti/drustvo/urucene-nagrade-braca-karic/mb2shcf Uručene nagrade "Braća Karić"], ''Blic'' (Source: Tanjug), 8 October 2012, accessed 18 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.otvoreniparlament.rs/poslanik/7913 MILANKA KARIĆ], Otvoreni Parlament, accessed 18 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
===2008 presidential campaign===
Karić ran as the Strength of Serbia Movement's candidate for [[president of Serbia]] in the [[Serbian presidential election, 2008|2008 election]], when her husband was outside the country to avoid criminal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;"Serbian ruling coalition facing more problems despite recent accord, agency says," British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 27 December 2007 (Source: Beta Week, Belgrade, in English 27 Dec 07).&lt;/ref&gt; Her campaign slogan was, "Family Is the Strength of Serbia."&lt;ref&gt;"Serb politicians use old slogans in 2017 campaign - analysis," British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 30 March 2017 (Source: Politika website in Serbian 0900 gmt 29 Mar 17).&lt;/ref&gt; She received 40,332 votes (0.98%), placing seventh in a field of nine candidates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rik.parlament.gov.rs/arhiva-izbori-za-predsednika-2008.php Избори за председника Републике, одржани 20. јануара и 3. фебруара 2008. године (РЕЗУЛТАТИ ИЗБОРА: Извештај о резултатима избора за председника Републике одржаних 20. јануара 2008. године)], Republika Srbija - Republička izborna komisija, accessed 18 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliamentarian===
Strength of Serbia fielded its own [[electoral list]] for the National Assembly of Serbia in the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2007|2007]] and [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2008|2008]] parliamentary elections; Karić led the list in 2007 and was given the second position in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.rik.parlament.gov.rs/arhiva-izbori-za-narodne-poslanike-2007.php Избори за народне посланике Народне скупштине одржани 21. јануара и 8. фебрауара 2007. године, ИЗБОРНЕ ЛИСТЕ (Покрет снага Србије - Богољуб Карић)], Republika Srbija - Republička izborna komisija, accessed 25 August 2017; and [http://www.rik.parlament.gov.rs/arhiva-izbori-za-narodne-poslanike-2008.php Избори за народне посланике Народне скупштине одржани 11. маја 2008. године, ИЗБОРНЕ ЛИСТЕ (Покрет СНАГА СРБИЈЕ - Богољуб Карић)], Republika Srbija - Republička izborna komisija, accessed 25 August 2017. Karić received the first position on the list in 2007 and the second position in 2008. It may be noted that her numerical position was actually irrelevant to her chances of election. From 2000 to 2011, parliamentary mandates were awarded to lists rather than to individual candidates, and it was a common practice for mandates to be awarded out of numerical order. See Law on the Election of Representatives, Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, No. 35/2000, made available via [http://www.legislationline.org/topics/country/5/topic/6 LegislationOnline], accessed 28 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In each instance, the list failed to cross the [[electoral threshold]] to win representation in the assembly.

Karić attended a major opposition rally in 2011, conveying greetings from her husband and announcing Strength of Serbia's alliance with the leadership of the [[Serbian Progressive Party]].&lt;ref&gt;"Opposition rally unlikely to produce early elections in Serbia - analysts," British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 7 February 2011 (Source: Danas website, Belgrade, in Serbian 7 Feb 11).&lt;/ref&gt;

Strength of Serbia contested the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2012|2012 parliamentary election]] as part of the Progressive Party's [[Let's Get Serbia Moving]] coalition.

The '''Namibia Chamber of Commerce and Industry'''  is the industrial and Chamber of Commerce in Namibia. It is headquartered in the capital [[Windhoek]]. In March 2013, the Chamber had about 2,500 members.&lt;ref name="allafrica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201405091580.html|title=allAfrica.com: Namibia: More Export Diversification Needed to Create Jobs|publisher=allafrica.com|accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Namibian Chamber of Commerce and Industry was established in 1990 as Namibia National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (NNCCI) in Windhoek. In 1998, the chamber was renamed and transferred to a legally independent, private-sector institution. As part of this realignment, the concept of regional chambers were implemented.&lt;ref name="allafrica2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201405091612.html|title=allAfrica.com: Namibia: Investment Climate Has Improved - NCCI, NMA Says (Page 1 of 2)|publisher=allafrica.com|accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tasks and Structure ==
NCCI is a non-profit organization whose mission is to represent the Namibian business enterprises from all economic sectors. It was on the basis of the Companies Act, Act no. 32 of 1973 established as a state institution. Additional areas of responsibility of the NCCI counts:

*Organizing and conducting conferences and trade shows
*Issues of trade
*Information gathering and reporting

'''Oaksterdam''' is a cultural [[district]] on the north end of [[Downtown Oakland|downtown Oakland, California]], where [[medical cannabis]] in a variety of competitively priced smokeable and edible preparations is available for purchase in multiple [[café|cafe]]s, [[Club (organization)|club]]s, and patient dispensaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/07/19/INJC18O001.DTL Oakland finds peace with its pot clubs]&lt;/ref&gt;  Oaksterdam is located on the north end of downtown Oakland, between downtown proper, the [[Lakeside Apartments District, Oakland, California|Lakeside]], and the financial district. It is roughly bordered by 14th Street on the southwest, Harrison Street on the southeast, 19th Street on the northeast, and [[Telegraph Avenue]] on the northwest. The name is a [[portmanteau]] of "Oakland" and "[[Cannabis coffee shop|Amsterdam]]," the capital of [[the Netherlands]], [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|where marijuana is semi-legal]]. Founded in 2007, and located in the heart of Oakland, [[Oaksterdam University]] is the nation's first cannabis college.  The school's mission is to provide quality training for the cannabis industry. Those interested in learning more about this emerging industry should learn to do so safely and responsibly in accordance with the law. At Oaksterdam University, state vs. federal law is the first class you are taught, in an effort to help you understand the law before you are taught anything else. The faculty at Oaksterdam University encompasses some of the most prominent names in the industry. Many of the faculty members not only helped write state law but also took medical marijuana cases to the Supreme Court. Oaksterdam University continues to educate, retaining its support from the city of Oakland.

Since 2005, cannabis has been available to patients with patient identification and physician recommendation at a busy dispensary in the neighborhood, one of Oakland's four officially licensed dispensaries under the current municipal ordinance.  According to [[California Proposition 215 (1996)|Proposition 215]], a statewide voter initiative which amended the [[California Health and Safety Code]], marijuana used for medical purposes is legal to possess, cultivate and donate for.&lt;ref&gt;California NORML. "Text of California Prop 215." http://www.canorml.org/prop/patientsguide.htm#prop&lt;/ref&gt; Dispensaries  require a doctor's note in order to obtain medical cannabis, which is legal under California Law but illegal under the federal [[Controlled Substances Act]].

==History==
The name ''Oaksterdam'' is a combination of ''Oakland'' and ''[[Amsterdam]]'', the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] city that is famously tolerant towards cannabis use. The term was coined by the late Jim McClelland, an AIDS patient who was a founding member of the Oakland Cannabis Buyers Club and the Berkeley Patients Group after prompting by Andrew Glazier, a fellow activist, that the neighborhood needed a name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://growlove.blogspot.com/2007/07/oaksterdamcom-is-up.html Oaksterdam.com is Up]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ohhburn.com/2009/06/marijuanalogues-1/ MarijuanaLogues #1]&lt;/ref&gt;
The history of Oaksterdam started with Oakland Buyers Cooperative Distributing to Prop 215&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposition 215|url=http://www.rxcbc.org/exa.html|work=Oakland Cannabis Buyers Cooperative|publisher=OCBC|accessdate=27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  patients with acts of courage mixed with legal wrangling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, PETITIONER  v.  OAKLAND CANNABIS BUYERS' COOPERATIVE AND JEFFREY JONES|url=http://www.justice.gov/osg/briefs/2000/2pet/7pet/2000-0151.pet.app.html|work=UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, PETITIONER  v.  OAKLAND CANNABIS BUYERS' COOPERATIVE AND JEFFREY JONES|publisher=United States Department of Justice|accessdate=27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  they stayed open until the federal authorities became an issue. After the federal authorities ordered the Oakland Cannabis Buyers Cooperative (OCBC) to shut down, a few OCBC members (like the late Jim McClelland and late Tim Sidwell) went around the corner and opened up The Zoo.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} The Zoo was a well stocked dispensary with deals that had clones as well as advice on how to cultivate. Soon after that a proliferation of clubs opened like The Bulldog, Compassionate Caregivers, The Lemon Drop, Oakland Patients Group, and 420 Cafe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Dan Lundgren went on a political warpath after Prop 215 was passed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Dennis Peron was arrested and San Francisco's safe source of medical cannabis was shut down.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} The Oakland City Council made a few proclamations then promptly made a few patients official medical cannabis officers like Jeff Jones and Ed Rosenthal as well as approve the distribution of medical cannabis as per Proposition 215.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} The Oakland Politicians were pro cannabis before Prop 215 and allowed a couple of groups to distribute.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} The Federal authorities however have continued to harass even though the Attorney General Eric Holder has stated publicly that the prosecution of medical cannabis is the federal authorities last priority.

On April 2, 2012 the [[IRS]] raided [[Oaksterdam University]]. Oaksterdam University continued to put on classes less than 2 days later. Incorrect reports often cite that the event was conducted by the DEA. No charges have been filed. {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Harborside has been also threatened as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/99852121/Forfeiture-Complaint-Harborside-San-Jose]&lt;/ref&gt;
Steve DeAngelo spoke out against the raids and the IRS threats and vowed to serve the patients and reminded us about the patients locked up in jail.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The DEA is systematically trying to destroy the medical cannabis community.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Location and character==
Oaksterdam is located on the north end of downtown Oakland, between downtown proper, the [[Lakeside Apartments District, Oakland, California|Lakeside]] and the Financial District.  It is roughly bordered by 14th Street on the southwest, Harrison Street on the southeast, 19th Street on the northeast, and Telegraph Ave on the northwest. It is characterized by mixed-use office and residential buildings with unique historic architecture that is older than some of the more modern skyscrapers south of 14th Street, and an abundance of ground floor retail shop spaces, restaurants and cafes.

A Julia Morgan-designed building is located at the northwest corner of 15th and Webster Streets, which was the original location of the Oakland YWCA. The neighborhood also features the [[Cathedral Building]], an ornate, historic [[Flatiron Building]] at Latham Square at the intersection of Broadway and Telegraph.

==Educational institutions==
The district features at least two institutions of higher learning, [[Lincoln University (California)|Lincoln University]] at 15th and Franklin, a small business school catering mainly to international students, and [[Oaksterdam University]] located at 1734 Telegraph Avenue, a business college which prepares students for careers in the cannabis industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oaksterdam University: Quality Training for the Cannabis Industry|url=http://www.oaksterdamuniversity.com/|work=Oaksterdam University|publisher=oaksterdamuniversity.com.|accessdate=27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Oaksterdam University was raided by the DEA on April 2, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where There’s Smoke, There’s Fire|url=http://oaksterdamraid.com/?p=123|work=OaksterdamRaid.com|publisher=OaksterdamRaid.com|accessdate=27 May 2012|date=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they performed a smash and grab.

==Transportation infrastructure==

===Mass transit===
The 19th Street [[BART]] metrorail station is located beneath Oaksterdam on Broadway between 17th and 20th Streets. The station has entrances on Broadway and on a pedestrian [[plaza]] that opens onto Telegraph Avenue. [[AC Transit]] also recently opened the [[Uptown Oakland|Uptown]] regional transit center nearby on Thomas L. Berkley Way (20th Street), which features multiple bus shelters with seating, [[NextBus]] arrival prediction signs, and [[Rapid|Rapid Bus]] service.

===Bicycle rental===

A bicycle rental service has opened in the neighborhood on 15th Street, serving one of the only bicycle rental stores in the area.  The bike shop incorporates a glass-blowing school{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.

===Pedicab service===

Recently a pedi-cab service (Oaksterkabs) was opened, staffed by a single cycle rickshaw. Now dubbed "The Cannabis Cruiser", the pedicab offers its services around the downtown area to students of Oaksterdam University, Oaksterdam employees and to pedestrians in general.

==Neighborhood retail==
The district is home to a number of coffee shops, a tea shop and hydroponic supply store, cafes, restaurants open into the evenings, a gift shop, two musical instrument stores and specialty stores. These shops and services also are attractive to cannabis tourists and enjoy a superior central location next to the 19th Street BART station and AC Transit connections.

===Medical cannabis dispensation===
Since legislative changes passed by the Oakland City Council in 2005, there is no longer a proliferation of cannabis dispensaries in the neighborhood as was the case for several years previously.  Most of these dispensaries had the chance to obtain non-profit status; some chose to not become non-profit and were no longer permitted to dispense cannabis. Under current legislation, there are four officially permitted dispensaries in the City of Oakland.  One of the four permits is held by a dispensary cafe in the neighborhood.

==="Measure Z clubs"===

"Measure Z" (as of 2014, Measure Z referred to a new Oakland public safety ballot measure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oakland Measure Z ballot text and arguments|url=http://www.acgov.org/rov/elections/20141104/documents/MeasureZ-V3.pdf|publisher=Alameda County Elections Office website}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead) clubs are businesses that sell cannabis to people over the age of 18.  One private club in Oaksterdam sells cannabis and food containing cannabis to adults who do not hold valid physician recommendations for medical marijuana, which are needed to obtain county-issued patient identification cards in California.

From 2005 to 2007, [[Oaksterdam University]] founder Richard Lee published the ''Oaksterdam News'', a quarterly newsprint periodical covering news in the California cannabis movement, with a circulation of 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faculty|url=http://oaksterdamuniversity.com/category/faculty/|website=Oaksterdam University|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Lee went on to found ''West Coast Cannabis'' (edited by author and activist [[Ngaio Bealum]]), which covers similar news stories as the ''Oaksterdam News'' in magazine format; ''Oaksterdam News'' editor [[Chris Conrad (Author)|Chris Conrad]] went on to found the ''[[West Coast Leaf]]'' that same year, with his wife [[Mikki Norris]], which ran with a circulation of 175,000 until 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The West Coast Leaf|url=http://www.westcoastleaf.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6292">A '''parliamentarian''' is an expert on [[parliamentary procedure]] who advises organizations and [[Deliberative assembly|deliberative assemblies]].  This sense of the term "parliamentarian" is distinct from the usage of the same term to mean a [[member of Parliament]].

== Types ==
Some parliamentarians are officers or employees of the [[deliberative assembly]] that they serve, as in the case of the [[Parliamentarian of the United States Senate]]. In most state legislative bodies, the secretary or chief clerk of the body serves as parliamentarian.&lt;ref name="fourthirty"&gt;{{cite parl|title=MAS|year=2000|pages=430|edition=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = California State Legislature – Leadership and Caucuses|url = http://www.legislature.ca.gov/the_state_legislature/leadership_and_caucuses/leadership.html|website = www.legislature.ca.gov|access-date = 2016-01-12|quote = Chief Clerk – A nonpartisan, nonmember officer of the Assembly elected by the majority of the membership at the start of each two-year session as its legislative officer and parliamentarian.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some organizations, a member of the organization may be appointed as the parliamentarian. Other parliamentarians have a contractual relationship, much like outside attorneys or accountants.

== Duties ==
Parliamentarians are expected to be experts in meeting procedures and such books as ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'' ''Newly Revised'' as well as the rules of the body they are working for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = General Assembly|url = http://www.pacapitol.com/VC/visitor_info/creating/legislative.htm|website = www.pacapitol.com|access-date = 2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rules of Order &gt; Chapter 3:  Officers|url = http://senate.la.gov/Documents/rules/chapter3.htm#10|website = senate.la.gov|access-date = 2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = So, You Want To Be a Parliamentarian?|url = http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2010/03/so_you_want_to_be_a_parliamentarian.html|newspaper = Slate|date = 2010-03-18|access-date = 2016-01-12|issn = 1091-2339|language = en-US|first = Brian|last = Palmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = National Association of Parliamentarians  » FAQ|url = http://www.parliamentarians.org/about/faq/|website = www.parliamentarians.org|access-date = 2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A parliamentarian may be called in to assist in drafting bylaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 556, 566–67|edition = 11th|ref = harv|display-authors = et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other responsibilities may include teaching classes or holding office hours during conventions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the parliamentarian's role is purely advisory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 465}}&lt;/ref&gt; At meetings, the parliamentarian should unobtrusively call the attention of the presiding officer to serious errors in procedure.&lt;ref name="fourthirty" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the advice of a parliamentarian is generally not binding on the presiding officer of an assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief|last = Robert III|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82019-9|location = Philadelphia, PA|page = 95|edition = 2nd|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Texplainer: What Does the Parliamentarian Do?|url = http://www.texastribune.org/2013/06/27/texplainer-what-does-parliamentarian-do/|website = The Texas Tribune|access-date = 2016-01-12|first = Elizabeth|last = Koh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the parliamentarian is a member of the assembly, that person has the same rights as other members, but should not exercise those rights to maintain impartiality, similar to the impartiality that is required of the chairman.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 467}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the parliamentarian should not be making motions, speaking in debate, or voting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Certification ==
The highest certifications of parliamentarians are the Professional Registered Parliamentarian, or PRP (issued by the [[National Association of Parliamentarians]]) and the Certified Professional Parliamentarian, or CPP, or the Certified Professional Parliamentarian Teacher, or CPP-T (both issued by the [[American Institute of Parliamentarians]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = National Association of Parliamentarians  » Types of NAP Membership|url = http://www.parliamentarians.org/applyjoin/types-of-nap-membership/|website = www.parliamentarians.org|access-date = 2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Certification - American Institute of Parliamentarians|url = http://aipparl.org/site/certification/|website = American Institute of Parliamentarians|access-date = 2016-01-12|language = en-US|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150927112057/http://aipparl.org/site/certification/|archivedate = 2015-09-27|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4839">A '''performance bond''', also known as a '''contract bond''', is a [[surety bond]] issued by an [[insurance]] company or a [[bank]] to guarantee satisfactory completion of a project by a [[independent contractor|contractor]]. The term is also used to denote a collateral deposit of [[Earnest payment|good faith money]], intended to secure a [[futures contract]], commonly known as [[Margin (finance)|margin]].

==History==
Performance bonds have been around since 2,750 BC. The Romans developed laws of surety around 150 AD,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Surety bonds for construction contracts|last=Russell|first=Jeffrey Burton|publisher=ASCE Press|year=2000|isbn=0-7844-0426-7|location=Reston, Va.|pages=9|coauthors=|authorlink=Jeffrey Burton Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt; the principles of which still exist.

==Overview==

A job requiring a payment and performance bond will usually require a bid bond, to bid the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-a-bid-bond-844376|title=What Happens if the Construction Bond Obligation is Not Met?|work=The Balance|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the job is awarded to the winning bid, a payment and performance bond will then be required as a security to the job completion. For example, a contractor may cause a performance bond to be issued in favour of a client for whom the contractor is constructing a building. If the contractor fails to construct the building according to the specifications laid out by the [[contract]] (most often due to the [[bankruptcy]] of the contractor), the client is guaranteed compensation for any monetary loss up to the amount of the performance bond.

Performance bonds are commonly used in the construction and development of real property, where an owner or investor may require the developer to assure that contractors or project managers procure such bonds in order to guarantee that the value of the work will not be lost in the case of an unfortunate event (such as insolvency of the contractor).  In other cases, a performance bond may be requested to be issued in other large contracts besides civil construction projects. Another example of this use is in commodity contracts where the seller is asked to provide a Bond to reassure the buyer that if the commodity being sold is not in fact delivered (for whatever reason) the buyer will at least receive compensation for his lost costs.

Performance bonds are generally issued as part of a 'Performance and Payment Bond', where a payment bond guarantees that the contractor will pay the labour and material costs they are obliged to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/how-payment-bonds-work-on-construction-projects-844794|title=Why You Need a Payment Bond for a Construction Project|work=The Balance|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performance bond cost===
Surety bond companies calculate the premium they charge for surety bonds based on three primary criteria: bond type, bond amount, and the applicant's risk. Once the bond type, amount, and applicant risk are adequately assessed, a surety bond underwriter is able to assign an appropriate surety bond price.

===Bond type===
Surety bond companies have actuarial information on the lifetime claims history for each bond type. Over time, surety bond underwriters are able to determine that some surety bonds are more risky than others. For example, a California Motor Vehicle Dealer bond has significantly more claims than a straightforward notary bond. If a given surety bond type has paid out a high percentage of claims, then the premium amount paid by applicants will be higher.

===Applicant's history/risk===
Surety bond companies attempt to predict the risk that an applicant represents. Those who are perceived to be a higher risk will pay a higher surety bond premium.  Since surety bond companies are providing a financial guarantee on the future work performance of those who are bonded, they must have a clear picture of the individual's history.

==In the United States==
In the United States, under the [[Miller Act]] of 1932, all Construction Contracts issued by the Federal Government must be backed by performance and payment bonds. States have enacted what is referred to as "[[Little Miller Act]]" statutes requiring performance and payment bonds on State Funded projects as well.

There are over 25,000 types of Surety Bonds in the United States. Each bond has a designated bond amount. Surety bond companies will determine bond rate based on risk and then charge a surety bond premium in the range 1-15% of the bond amount.

== Work ==
Marshall has been profiled in ''Click Here to Order: Stories of the World's Most Successful Internet Marketing Entrepreneurs''&lt;ref name="clickhere2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Click here to order : stories of the world's most successful internet marketing entrepreneurs|last=Joyner|first=Joel Comm ; foreword by Mark|publisher=Morgan James Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-1600371738|location=Garden City, NY|pages=146–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Joel Comm]] and ''Online Marketing Heroes: Interviews with 25 Successful Online Marketing Gurus''&lt;ref name="Onlineheroes2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Online marketing heroes : interviews with 25 successful online marketing gurus|last=Miller|first=Michael|publisher=Wiley Pub.|year=2008|isbn=978-0-470-24204-9|location=Indianapolis, IN|pages=217–224}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Michael Miller.

=== Guerrilla Marketing and Google AdWords ===
Marshall started working with AdWords in 2002 soon after it was first introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/468816381|title=Google AdWords for dummies|last=Howie.|first=Jacobson,|date=2009|publisher=Wiley Pub|year=|isbn=9781118051726|edition= 2nd|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=150|oclc=468816381}}&lt;/ref&gt; He released ''Guerrilla Marketing for Hi-Tech Sales People'', in which he likened the use of AdWords and emerging [[social media]] to the graffiti and flash mobs of [[Jay Conrad Levinson]]'s [[guerrilla marketing]] - economical attention-getting that created a grassroots customer base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.amazon.com/Guerilla-Marketing-Hi-Tech-Sales-People/dp/B004U1A5P0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511219277|title=Guerilla Marketing for Hi-Tech Sales People - 21 Secrets of High-Impact, Low Cost Marketing|date=2002|people=Marshall, Perry|access-date=November 20, 2017|medium=Audio CD}}&lt;/ref&gt; He consulted and wrote on the strategy of customers finding their vendors using the newly developing [[search advertising]]; "when the customer finds you, instead of you finding the customer, his or her perception of you is different."&lt;ref name="Mark022"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perrymarshall.com/marketing/m02/|title=Marketing 02|last=Marshall|first=Perry|publisher=Perry Marshall &amp; Associates|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WPClick2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/10/AR2010021003965_2.html|title=Perry|last=Marshall|first=Perry|date=February 1, 2010|newspaper=Washington Post|accessdate=12 July 2013|author2=Bryan Todd}}&lt;/ref&gt; He documented the process and released the ''Definitive Guide to Google AdWords''.&lt;ref name="SMSInterview3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.searchmarketingstandard.com/interview-with-search-engine-marketing-expert-perry-marshall|title=Interview With Search Engine Marketing Expert Perry Marshall|last=Milyan|first=Andrey|date=Summer 2006|publisher=Search Marketing Standard|accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ultimate Guide to Google AdWords'' followed in 2007;&lt;ref name="adwordsfordummies3"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Google_AdWords_For_Dummies.html?id=9_2TzakSYwcC|title=Google AdWords for dummies|last=Jacobson|first=Howie|author2=McDonald, Kristie|author3=McDonald, Joel|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2012|isbn=1118115619|edition= 3rd|location=Hoboken, N.J.|pages=277–278, 289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Split testing ===
Starting with his first book on the subject, Marshall advocated AdWords [[A/B testing|split testing]] for [[market research]] and captured a set of guidelines for using split testing around types of ad copy and page positions that included precise wording.&lt;ref name="SMSInterview3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adwordsfordummies3"/&gt;{{rp|289}} He coined the term "AdWords [[stupidity tax]]" for the premium Google charged on broad matching of search items.&lt;ref name="Successsecrets2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Success secrets of the online marketing superstars|last=Meyerson|first=Mitch|publisher=Dearborn Trade Pub.|year=2005|isbn=1419505017|location=Chicago|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mastering2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Mastering_the_World_of_Marketing.html?id=y-PO1yBSmhAC|title=Mastering the world of marketing : the ultimate training resource from the biggest names in marketing|last=Riklan|first=Eric Taylor, David|date=2011-05-04|publisher=Wiley|isbn=0470888415|location=Hoboken, N.J.|pages=102–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Facebook marketing and 80/20 ===
In 2011, Marshall published ''Ultimate guide to Facebook advertising'', in which he focused on guerrilla marketing techniques to social media.&lt;ref name=ENTFacebook&gt;{{cite news|last=Marshall|first=Perry|title=How Facebook Tools Can Revitalize Ad Campaigns|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/224186|accessdate=12 July 2013|newspaper=Entrepreneur Magazine|date=September 25, 2012|author2=Thomas Meloche}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, he was a featured consultant on [[The Next Internet Millionaire]], a [[reality show]] hosted by [[Joel Comm]]. Marshall spoke with the contestants on [[Richard Koch|Richard Koch's]] [[80/20 rule]] as it applied to internet advertising and his philosophy of investing in grassroots marketing.&lt;ref name="Luchuck"&gt;{{cite book|title=From cubicle slave to the next Internet millionaire|last=Comm|first=Jaime Luchuck ; forward by Joel|publisher=Madeeasy Pub.|year=2008|isbn=1600373720|location=New York|pages=205–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expanded on this philosophy in his 2013 book, ''80/20 Sales and Marketing'', where he discussed the rule as a possible truism across several economic bands .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=80/20 Sales and Marketing|last=Marshall|first=Perry|date=August 2013|publisher=Entrepreneur Press|isbn=1599185059|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reviewed in the Huffington Post&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-fox/sell-more-by-achieving-go_b_3741007.html|title=Sell More By Achieving 'Good Enough'|last=Fox|first=John|date=2013-08-12|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Inc.com reviewed it as one of the "5 Best Sales Books of 2013."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/the-5-best-sales-books-of-2013.html|title=5 Best Sales Books of 2013|date=10 December 2013|work=Inc.com|access-date=2018-03-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshall wrote about the notion of 80/20 as a fractal [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-koch/can-fractal-8020-tap-insa_b_7016478.html phenomenon] which informs pricing strategy. Leonard Kim of INC Magazine summarizes: “Within every 80/20, there is another 80/20 inside of that, then another 80/20 inside that...4% of your customers will generate 64% of your revenues; 1% of your customers will generate 50% of your revenues; 0.2% of your customers will generate 40% of your [https://www.inc.com/leonard-kim/youre-losing-money-if-you-arent-following-this-pricing-strategy.html revenues].”

=== Evolution ===
Marshall is the author of ''Evolution 2.0: Breaking the Deadlock Between Darwin and Design'', a text in which he discusses his support for [[evolutionary creation]]. In addition he has delivered lectures on the topic, for example, at a conference of the [[American Scientific Affiliation]].&lt;ref name="ASA2015" /&gt;  He has also supported the theological position of [[continuationism]]; and   composed a list of [[Miracle#Christianity|miracles]] that he personally experienced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coffeehousetheology.com/miracles/|title=Documented Miracles: Lie #8: "Miracles ceased with the disciples."|last=Marshall|first=Perry|publisher=Coffeehouse Theology|language=English|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive competition law was first proposed in the late 1980s during the administration of President [[Cory Aquino]].&lt;ref name="RapplerJuly2015" /&gt;

The Philippines was the only country in [[ASEAN]] without a competition law and the integration of ASEAN into a single market was an impetus to pass the act.&lt;ref name="RapplerJuly2015" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13579">'''Public Law 114-216''' is the federal law of the [[United States]] that regulates [[GMO food]] labeling. It was enacted on July 29, 2016 when [[President Obama]] signed then [[Senate Bill]] 764 (S.764). While the law is officially termed ''A bill to reauthorize and amend the [[National Sea Grant College Program]] Act, and for other purposes'', it evolved over time into "the legislative vehicle for a measure concerning bioengineered food disclosure".&lt;ref name=congress&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/764| author= [[U. S. Congress]] |title=S.764 - A bill to reauthorize and amend the National Sea Grant College Program Act, and for other purposes. |publisher=U. S. Congress| date=2016| accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was crafted by Sen. [[Pat Roberts]] (R-KS) and [[Debbie Stabenow]] (D-MI).&lt;ref name=science/&gt; The  "GMO labeling bill"&lt;ref name=fortune&gt;{{cite web| url=http://fortune.com/2016/07/31/gmo-labeling-bill/ | author=Michael Addady |title=President Obama Signed This GMO Labeling Bill| publisher=Fortune |date=July 31, 2016 |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was introduced by its sponsor, Sen. [[Roger F. Wicker]] (R-MS), cosponsored by Sen. [[Dan Sullivan (U.S. Senator)|Dan Sullivan]] (R-AK), and  passed Senate and House in June 2016. The law overturned relevant state laws such as Vermont's GMO labeling law that had called for strict and transparent GMO food labeling in Vermont after July 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/2/obama-signs-bill-overturning-vermonts-gmo-labeling/| author=Stephen Dinan |title= Obama signs bill overturning Vermont's GMO labeling law|publisher=[[Washington Post]]| date=August 2, 2016 |accessdate=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labeling of GMO food is mandated in at least 64 countries, including most European countries, China, Russia, Japan, Brazil, South Africa, and Australia.&lt;ref name=labelit&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.justlabelit.org/right-to-know-center/labeling-around-the-world/ |author= |title=Labeling around the world| publisher=justlabelit.org| date=  | accessdate=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
The bill was created to "establish a national bioengineered food disclosure standard", whereby bioengineered food (commonly referred to as genetically modified organism or GMO food) is defined as "food that has been genetically engineered in a way that could not be obtained through conventional breeding or found in nature".&lt;ref name=congress/&gt; It charges the [[U. S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) to establish a national mandatory bioengineered food disclosure standard within two years with certain provisions:&lt;ref name=congress/&gt;
* Food from an animal cannot be declared bioengineered on the basis that animal has been fed bioengineered food.
* The minimum amount of bioengineered food present in food needs to be defined by the USDA to  carry the bioengineered label.
* The disclosure of bioengineered food can be a text, a symbol, or a digital or electronic link according to the discretion of the food manufacturer. 
* USDA is asked to conduct a study to see whether challenges exist in regard to access to electronic information.
* In certain cases a telephone number or internet site are allowed as a means of disclosure.
* Restaurant food and "very small" food manufacturers are excluded from disclosure requirements.
* States (and its subunits) are prohibited from establishing or continuing to require other GMO labeling practices.
* Food cannot be claimed to have no bioengineered food when there is no disclosure label.
* Certification by USDA's  [[National Organic Program]] "is sufficient" for a claim that bioengineered food is absent.
[[File:QR code for mobile English Wikipedia.svg|thumb|The law indicates that an [[QR code]] could suffice as a GMO label]]

== USDA responsible for GMO labeling ==
While the [[FDA]] is responsible for protecting and promoting [[public health]] through the control and supervision of [[food safety]], the agency holds the position that "the use of [[genetic engineering]] in the production of food does not present any safety concerns for such foods as a class", and , as there is "an absence of reliable data indicating safety concerns" with GMO foods as a class, voiced no opposition for USDA having the responsibility of regulating GMO food labeling.&lt;ref name=fda&gt;{{cite web |url= http://4bgr3aepis44c9bxt1ulxsyq.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FDA-HHS-TA-on-Senate-GE-compromise-bill.pdf |date= June 27, 2016 |title=FDA/HHS Technical Assistance on Senate Agriculture Committee draft legislation to establish a national disclosure standard for bioengineered foods (EDW16734) |publisher=FDA| accessdate=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The agency commented that the bill has language that may allow GMO material to escape labeling: the bill requires labeling if the food contains "genetic material", but that may exempt secondary products like oil, starches, sweeteners, or proteins derived from GMO substrates.&lt;ref name=fda/&gt; The agency  questioned the specificity of  the definition of bioengineered food when it would not apply to GMOs that could also be achieved by 'conventional breeding".&lt;ref name=fda/&gt; The FDA has also voiced some concerns about food information being presented in electronic codes.&lt;ref name=fda/&gt;

As the details of the law need to be worked out, USDA established a working group by September 2016 "to develop a timeline for rulemaking and to ensure an open and transparent process for effectively establishing this new program, which will increase consumer confidence and understanding of the foods they buy, and avoid uncertainty for food companies and farmers".&lt;ref name=qns&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.foodqualityandsafety.com/article/usda-begins-crafting-rules-mandatory-gmo-food-labels/ |author=Ted Agres |title=USDA Begins Crafting Rules for Mandatory GMO Food Labels |publisher=Food Quality and Safety| date=September 13, 2016 |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History== 
Public Law 114-216 was passed after previous attempts to introduce a national GMO labeling bill had failed. It was fast-tracked without debate or committee review.&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/07/us-senate-passes-gm-food-labeling-bill| author=Dianne Lugo |title=U.S. Senate passes GM food labeling bill| publisher=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=July 8, 2016 |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=consumerist&gt;{{cite web |url= https://consumerist.com/2016/07/29/president-signs-law-that-outlaws-vermont-gmo-labeling-rules-replaces-them-with-barcodes/| author=Chris Moran |title= President Signs Law That Overturns Vermont GMO Labeling Rules, Replaces Them With Barcodes |publisher=consumerist.com |date=July 29, 2016| accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original bill S. 764  - "A bill to reauthorize and amend the National Sea Grant College Program Act, and for other purposes" -  had nothing to do with food and stalled after having passed the Senate. Hollowed out of its content it was replaced with a bill to defund [[Planned Parenthood]].&lt;ref name=764related&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/764/related-bills|title=Related Bills - S.764 - 114th Congress (2015-2016): A bill to reauthorize and amend the National Sea Grant College Program Act, and for other purposes.|first=Wicker,|last=Roger|date=29 July 2016|website=U.S. Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bill was then replaced with a bill creating to outlaw state-level GMO labeling and setting a voluntary GMO labeling bill.&lt;ref name=764related/&gt; When this bill failed, the S. 764 husk was used to rush through the present bill, just in time before the Vermont GMO food labeling requirement would have been activated on July 1.&lt;ref name=consumerist/&gt;

Previous attempts to enact a national GMO labeling law included H. R. 1599 in 2015 – ''the  Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015''. It was a proposed legislative amendment to the United States [[Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act]].&lt;ref name=hr1599&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1599/text |title=H.R. 1599 - Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015| publisher=US Congress |date=March 25, 2015 |accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act passed the House of  Representatives on July 23, 2015 but failed in the Senate. An earlier version of the bill had been originally introduced as H. R. 4432 in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4432 |title=H.R.4432 - Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2014| publisher=US Congress |date=April 9, 2014 |accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempted to regulate food labeling specifically in view of the introduction of [[GMO food]] in the United States.

==Proponents' view==
[[Katie Hill]], White House spokesperson, lauded the bill, "(t)his measure will provide new opportunities for consumers to have access to information about their food".&lt;ref name=fortune/&gt; Proponents have argued for a comprehensive labeling law that applies nationwide instead of a "patchwork" approach state-by-state.&lt;ref name=lange&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecochildsplay.com/2015/07/25/house-passed-the-dark-act-h-r-1599-banning-states-rights-for-gmo-labeling/ |author =Jennifer Lange|  title=House passed the Dark Act H.R. 1599 banning states’ rights for GMO labeling| publisher=Eco Child's Play| date=July 25, 2015 |accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also feel that a  proposed bill will enhance  agricultural biotechnology.&lt;ref name=lange/&gt;

Proponents argue that approved GMO food has undergone extensive testing, is "safe" and that basically labeling is unnecessary. Labeling may discourage consumers to use GMO products when such a choice may be irrational. A lot of consumers express fears that have not been substantiated by science.&lt;ref name=kopicki/&gt;

The bill is backed by [[Grocery Manufacturers Association]], [[Monsanto]], and other large food and beverage corporations.&lt;ref name=ecow&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ecowatch.com/dark-act-clears-first-senate-hurdle-now-what-1908717697.html |author=Lorraine Chow |title=GMO Label Bill Clears Major Hurdle in Senate ... Now What?| publisher=EcoWatch |date=July 7, 2016 |accessdate=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opponents' view==
While GMOs are present in 75-80% of food Americans consume and have been termed "substantially equivalent" to the corresponding non-GMO foods by the FDA, consumers believe that they have a right to know what is in their food.&lt;ref name=fortune/&gt;  Thus, a 2013 poll by the [[New York Times]] indicated that ninety-three percent of American consumers would like to know if their food has been genetically modified.&lt;ref name=kopicki&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/science/strong-support-for-labeling-modified-foods.html?_r=1 |author=Allison Kopicki |title=Strong Support for Labeling Modified Foods| publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 27, 2013 |accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary objection to the bill is that manufacturers have the option to use electronic codes in lieu of clear readable labels placed directly on the food package, which they argue hides the information.&lt;ref name=qns/&gt; The bill allows the use codes such as the [[QR code]] as a form of labeling, and opponents see this as impractical as well as discriminatory. They argue that, for instance, low-income families may not be able to access the information.&lt;ref name=fortune/&gt; Critics also oppose the fact that no fines or penalties are included when companies do not follow the law.&lt;ref name=science/&gt; Additionally, they are concerned that the bill's stipulation that labeling will be required when foods contain genetic material from genetic modification may exempt many of the highly processed foods and ingredients that are usually derived from genetically-modified crops (such as many seed oils, [[high-fructose corn syrup]], and some refined starches and sweeteners), because such foods are often sufficiently refined that no genetic material remains in them.&lt;ref name="Plumer2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Plumer|first1=Brad|title=The controversial GMO labeling bill that just passed Congress, explained|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/7/7/12111346/gmo-labeling-bill-congress|accessdate=7 December 2016|work=Vox.com|date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator Stabenow  dismissed this interpretation when it was advanced by the FDA.&lt;ref name="Strom2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strom|first1=Stephanie|title=G.M.O. Labeling Bill Clears First Hurdle in Senate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/07/business/gmo-labeling-bill-passes-first-hurdle-in-senate.html?_r=0|accessdate=7 December 2016|work=[[New York Times]]|date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because clear and accessible labeling is not mandated, some opponents have called this bill and its predecessors the "DARK act" as in "Deny Americans the Right to Know" or "Keep Americans in the DARK".&lt;ref name=labelit/&gt;&lt;ref name=ecow/&gt;&lt;ref name=brodwin&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/2015/07/30/dont-stop-states-from-passing-gmo-labeling-laws |author=David Brodwin |title=Don't Leave GMOs in the Dark |publisher=US News &amp; World Report |date=July 30, 2015 |access-date=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salvador V. Vassallo''' (24 March 1942 – 21 January 2007) was the [[president (corporate title)|president]] and [[CEO]] of [[Industrias Vassallo|Vassallo Industries]], [[headquarters|headquartered]] in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]]. The company produces  [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] injection moulded and extruded goods, and markets them worldwide.

==Early years==
Vassallo (birth name: '''Salvador V. Vassallo Ruiz''' &lt;ref group=note&gt;{{Spanish name|'''Vassallo'''|'''Ruiz'''|plain=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;), grandparents migrated from [[Italy]] in the late 19th century and settled in the town of [[Yauco, Puerto Rico|Yauco]]. Vassallo, nicknamed "Chiry", and his brothers were born in [[Yauco, Puerto Rico|Yauco]] and raised in the city of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]] where their father, Salvador Vassallo Sr., opened a [[hardware store]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelponce.com/Commerce-and-Business.html Profile], TravelPonce.com; accessed 2 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

After school hours, Vassallo and his brothers, Efraín, Víctor, Félix, and Marcos, would work in the family business. Salvador Vassallo Sr. founded Vassallo Industries, Inc., a company which initially made only windows and cement blocks.&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;[http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/vol4n15/CBVassallo-en.shtml Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112225902/http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/vol4n15/CBVassallo-en.shtml|date=12 January 2007}}, PuertoRico-herald.org; accessed 2 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salvador joins family business==
After Vassallo graduated from college, he went to work in as a salesman for his father's business. Traveling throughout Puerto Rico taking orders from established customers, he made new contacts with potential customers. These skills would serve him well when Vassallo and his brothers inherited the business. In the 1950s, Vassallo's brother Efrain David, an engineer and the oldest of the Vassallo brothers, saw the potential in [[plastic]].&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt;

==Vassallo Industries Inc.==
As a consequence of Efrain's vision, in 1962 Vassallo Industries Inc. pioneered the manufacture and distribution of plastic pipe and fittings for sanitary and electrical applications.  In 1972, Salvador Vassallo Sr. died and the company was inherited by his sons.  Efrain David was President and Chief Executive Officer of Vassallo Industries Inc. from 1978-89. During those 11 years the firm had a net profit of over $25 million, as audited by Deloitte, Haskins &amp; Sells, 1978-89.&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt;

In 1989, Efrain David sold his interest in Vassallo Industries and all his patents to his brothers, and joined son Efrain David Jr., in the development of the Puerto Rican marble industry. Vassallo Industries, Inc., named Salvador as its president, and the company grew to become a global leader in the manufacture of PVC. Today, it has strong brand recognition in the [[United States]] and [[Latin-America]].&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt; In the 1980s Vassallo opened a distribution Center in [[Miami, Florida]], to speed up order fulfillment and cut costs.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Vassallo Molding Company and other ventures==
In 1989 Salvador bought out his brothers and became president and chairman, assuming the [[CEO]] post in 2002.  In the 1990s Vassallo founded Vassallo Molding Company for the manufacture of plastic furniture and household goods.  In 1997, [[Home Depot]] became a client in addition to [[Kmart]] and [[Wal-Mart]].&lt;ref name="VI"&gt;[http://www.pridco.gobierno.pr/english/media_center/art_view.php?art_id=486&amp;retp=4 Vasallo Industries buys plastics manufacturer Syroco Inc.]{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company added a research and development division to its growing empire, with emphasis on quality control.  The company now has over forty [[patent]]s for different PVC products.&lt;ref name="VII"&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-5423111/Vassallo-rolls-with-the-punches.html Vassallo rolls with the punches to grow.(Vassallo Industries Inc.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2000, Efrain Vassallo (the only Puerto Rican named National Small Businessman of the Year [in 1996], to date) rejoined his brother in Vassallo Industries Inc as a consultant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/vol4n15/CBVassallo-en.html ''Vassallo Expands Products, Wins Substantial Contracts.''] Lida Estela Ruano. Puerto Rico Herald. 13 April 2000. Accessed 3 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Vassallo Industries Inc. invested $15 million in the expansion of its facility in Ponce, in an effort to produce Polyvinyl Chloride pellets for distribution in the United States, [[Caribbean]] and [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name="VI"/&gt;

In 2004, Vassallo Industries Inc. acquired [[Syroco| Syroco Inc.]], a plastics manufacturer, adding manufacturing operations in [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Arkansas]].  Syroco is one of the most prominent manufacturers of plastic furniture and wall decor in the United States. By acquiring Syroco, Vassallo Industries Inc. added [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[Sam's Club]], [[Lowe's]] and [[Walgreens]] to its clientele.&lt;ref name="VII"/&gt;

Among the many products manufactured by the company founded by Salvador Vassallo are the following: fittings, flexible conduit, flower pots, leaf rakes, step stones, water tanks, pipes, PVC cement, kayaks and water floats. The company produces plastic furniture under the brand Signature Series Line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vassallointernational.com/#home Vassallo International], vassallointernational.com; accessed 24 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Vassallo's son, Rafael Vassallo, was named the president of Vassallo Industries Inc. and executive vice president of Syroco Inc.  Salvador Vassallo continued to be the CEO of the company and president of the Export Council of [[Puerto Rico]]. His nephew, [[Jesse Vassallo|Jesse]], (Victor's son), a swimmer, has continued the family tradition by establishing "Vassallo Unlimited".&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3718/is_200507/ai_n14900657 Syroco invests in its future], findarticles.com; accessed 2 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 21 January 2007, Salvador Vassallo died in the Hospital San Cristóbal in Ponce from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. He was buried in Las Mercedes Cemetery, and was survived by his wife Olga and two children, Rafael and Viviana. 

The [[Mayor]] of Ponce, [[Francisco Zayas Seijo]], declared three days of mourning and ordered the flags at Ponce's City Hall to be flown at half mast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-6206909/Vassallo-co-founder-Chiry-dies.html Obituary], goliath.ecnext.com; accessed 2 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Straight-Through Quality''' ('''STQ''') are approaches and outputs of [[test automation]] that have [[quality (business)|quality]] and deliver business benefit. STQ takes its name from the business concept of [[straight-through processing]] (STP). Also acting as a tool and enabler for STP.

Traditional techniques for testing and delivery have often required a great deal of manual support and intervention. These approaches are subject to human error, cost of delay and lack of reuse. These also have the negative side-effect of being unable to deliver '[[fail-fast]]' approaches, which have proven popular with [[Agile software development|Agile]] practitioners. Previous traditional approaches have been typically expensive where whole silo'ed departments are created within commercial companies to deliver Quality and Deployment alone. Thus STQ as an approach hopes to resolve this problem.

== Examples ==

Tangible examples of STQ approaches in the software industry are present and often known as [[continuous integration]] (CI) and [[continuous delivery]] (CD). These combined can ensure that software delivery is integrated, automatically tested and ready for automatic delivery at any time. Together [[CI/CD]] can enable STQ which can be used as Business output terminology for business users who do not understand the technical complexities of CI/CD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agiledogma.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/straight-through-quality-introduces.html Straight-Through Quality - Introducing the Agile concepts of Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery to the Business.]{{rs|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Syriana''''' is a 2005 American [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] [[thriller film]] written and directed by [[Stephen Gaghan]], and executive produced by [[George Clooney]], who also stars in the film with an [[ensemble cast]]. Gaghan's screenplay is loosely [[Film adaptation|adapted]] from [[Robert Baer]]'s memoir ''[[See No Evil (book)|See No Evil]]''. The film focuses on [[petroleum politics]] and the global influence of the [[oil industry]], whose political, economic, legal, and social effects are experienced by a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] operative ([[George Clooney]]), an energy analyst ([[Matt Damon]]), a [[Washington, D.C.]] attorney ([[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]), and a young unemployed [[Pakistani]] migrant worker ([[Mazhar Munir]]) in an [[Arab]] state in the Persian Gulf. The film also features an extensive supporting cast including [[Amanda Peet]], [[Tim Blake Nelson]], [[Mark Strong]], [[Alexander Siddig]], [[Amr Waked]], and [[Academy Award]] winners [[Christopher Plummer]], [[Chris Cooper]] and [[William Hurt]].

As with Gaghan's screenplay for ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]'', ''Syriana'' uses multiple, parallel storylines, jumping between locations in [[Iran]], [[Texas]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Switzerland]], [[Spain]] and [[Lebanon]].

Clooney won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his role as Bob Barnes, and Gaghan's script was nominated by the Academy for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. As of April 20, 2006, the film had grossed a total of $50.82 million at the U.S. box office and $42.9 million overseas, for a total of $93.73 million.

==Plot==
U.S. energy giant Connex Oil is losing control of key [[oil field]]s in a Persian Gulf kingdom ruled by the al-Subaai family. The [[emirate]]'s [[foreign minister]], Prince Nasir, has granted [[natural gas]] drilling rights to a [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] company, greatly upsetting the U.S. oil industry and the U.S. government. To compensate for its decreased production capacity, Connex initiates a shady merger with Killen, a smaller oil company that recently won the drilling rights to key petroleum fields in [[Kazakhstan]]. Connex-Killen ranks as the world's twenty-third largest economy, and antitrust regulators at the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]] have concerns. A Washington, D.C.-based law firm headed by Dean Whiting is hired to smooth the way for the merger. Bennett Holiday is assigned to promote the impression of due diligence to the DOJ, deflecting any allegations of corruption.

===Emir storyline===
Bryan Woodman is an American energy analyst based in Geneva. Woodman's supervisor directs him to attend a private party hosted by the emir at his estate in Spain, to offer his company's services. The emir's illness during the party prevents Woodman from speaking directly with him while, at the same time, the emir's younger son, Prince Meshal Al-Subaai, shows the estate's many rooms and areas to Chinese oil executives via remote-controlled cameras. No one notices that a crack in one of the swimming pool area's underwater lights has electrified the water. Just as Woodman and all the other guests are brought to the pool area, Woodman's son jumps into the pool and is electrocuted.

In reparation and out of sympathy for the loss of his son, Prince Nasir, the emir's older son, grants Woodman's company oil interests worth $75 million, and Woodman, though initially insulted by the offer, gradually becomes his economic advisor. Prince Nasir is dedicated to the idea of progressive reform and understands that oil dependency is not sustainable in the long term; Nasir wants to utilize his nation's oil profits to diversify the economy and introduce democratic reforms, in sharp contrast to his father's repressive government, which has been supported by American interests. His father, at the urging of the American government, names the younger Meshal as his successor, causing Nasir to attempt a coup.

===Assassination storyline===
Bob Barnes is a veteran [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent trying to stop illegal arms trafficking in the [[Middle East]]. While on assignment in Tehran to kill two arms dealers, Barnes notices that one of two [[anti-aircraft missiles]] intended to be used in a bombing was diverted to an Egyptian, while the other explodes and kills the two arms dealers. The dealers are later revealed to be Iranian Intelligence agents. Barnes makes his superiors nervous by writing memos about the missile theft and is subsequently reassigned to a desk job. However, unaccustomed to the political discretion required, he quickly embarrasses the wrong people by speaking his mind and is sent back to the field with the assignment of assassinating Prince Nasir, whom the CIA identifies as being the financier behind the Egyptian's acquisition of the missile. Prior to his reassignment, Barnes confides in his ex-CIA agent friend, Stan Goff, that he will return to [[Lebanon]]. Goff advises him to clear his presence with [[Hezbollah]] so they know he is not acting against them. Barnes travels to Lebanon, obtains safe passage from a Hezbollah leader, and hires a mercenary named Mussawi to help kidnap and kill Nasir. But Mussawi has become an Iranian agent and has Barnes abducted. Mussawi tortures Barnes and prepares to behead him, but the Hezbollah leader arrives and stops him.

When the CIA learns that Mussawi plans to broadcast the agency's intention to kill Nasir, they set Barnes up as a scapegoat, portraying him as a rogue agent. Barnes's boss, Terry George, worries that Barnes might talk about the Nasir assassination plan and that killing Nasir with a drone would make it obvious as an American-backed assassination. He has Barnes's passports revoked, locks him out of his computer at work, and initiates an investigation of him. Barnes, however, learns from Goff that Whiting, working on behalf of a group of businessmen calling themselves The Committee to Liberate Iran, is responsible for Barnes's blackballing and the assassination, and threatens him and his family unless he halts the investigation and releases Barnes's passports.

Barnes returns to the Middle East and approaches Prince Nasir's convoy to warn him of the assassination plan. As he arrives, a guided bomb from a circling Predator drone strikes the automobile of Nasir and his family, killing them instantly. Woodman, having earlier offered his seat in Nasir's car to members of his family, survives the missile strike and goes home to his wife and son.

===Wasim storyline===
Pakistani migrant workers Saleem Ahmed Khan and his son Wasim board a bus to go to work at a Connex refinery, only to discover that they have been laid off. Since the company had provided food and lodging, the workers face the threat of poverty and deportation due to their unemployed status. Wasim desperately searches for work but is refused because he doesn't speak Arabic. Wasim and his friend join a madrasa to learn Arabic in order to improve their employment prospects. While playing soccer, they meet a charismatic cleric who eventually leads them to execute a suicide attack on a Connex-Killen tanker using an explosive from the missing Tehran missile.

===Merger storyline===
Bennett Holiday meets with Dean Whiting, who is convinced that Killen bribed someone to get the drilling rights in [[Kazakhstan]]. While investigating Connex-Killen's records, Holiday discovers a wire transfer of funds that leads back to a transaction between Texas oilman and Killen colleague Danny Dalton and Kazakh officials. Holiday tells Connex-Killen of his discovery, and they pretend not to have known about it. Holiday advises Dalton that he will likely be charged with corruption in order to serve as a "body" to get the DOJ off the back of the rest of Connex-Killen. [[U.S. Attorney]] Donald Farish III then strong-arms Holiday into giving the DOJ information about illegal activities he has discovered. Holiday gives up Dalton, but Farish says this is not enough. Holiday meets with the CEO of Killen Oil, Jimmy Pope, and informs him that the DOJ needs a second body in order to drop the investigation. Pope asks Holiday whether a person at Holiday's firm above him would be sufficient as the additional body. Holiday acknowledges that if the name were big enough, the DOJ would stop the investigation and allow the merger.

Holiday is brought by his colleague and mentor Sydney Hewitt to meet with the Chairman &amp; CEO of Connex Oil, Leland "Lee" Janus. Holiday reveals an under-the-table deal that Hewitt made while the Connex-Killen merger was being processed. Holiday has given Hewitt to the DOJ as the second body, thereby protecting the rest of Connex-Killen. Janus is able to accept the "Oil Industry Man of the Year" award with a load taken off his shoulders.

==Production==
While working on ''Traffic'', Stephen Gaghan began to see parallels between drug addiction and America's dependency on foreign oil.&lt;ref name= "Grady"&gt;{{cite news| last = Grady| first = Pam| coauthors =| title = ''Syriana'', Staccato Style| work = FilmStew| pages =| language =| publisher =| date = December 16, 2005| url = http://www.filmstew.com/ShowArticle.aspx?ContentID=12969| accessdate = 2009-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source of inspiration came from 9/11 and Gaghan's lack of knowledge about the Middle East. He said, "When 9/11 happened, it suddenly was a war on terror, which I think of as a war on emotions. It all started to click for me."&lt;ref name="Nguyen"&gt;{{cite news| last = Nguyen| first = Ky N| coauthors = | title = Tracks of Terrorism| work = The Washington Diplomat| pages = | language = | publisher = | date = January 2006| url = http://www.washdiplomat.com/January%202006/b_filminter_01_06.html| accessdate = 2009-04-15| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110511150135/http://www.washdiplomat.com/January%202006/b_filminter_01_06.html| archivedate = 2011-05-11| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks after 9/11, [[Steven Soderbergh]] sent Gaghan a copy of ex-CIA officer Robert Baer's memoir, ''See No Evil''.&lt;ref name= "Halbfinger"&gt;{{cite news| last = Halbfinger| first = David M| coauthors =| title = Hollywood has a Hot New Agency| work = [[The New York Times]]| pages =| language =| publisher =| date = May 15, 2005| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/movies/15halb.html?_r=1&amp;scp=13&amp;sq=%22Syriana%22&amp;st=nyt| accessdate = 2009-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The screenwriter read the book and wanted to turn it into a film because it added another layer to the story that Gaghan wanted to tell.&lt;ref name="Grady"/&gt; Soderbergh bought the rights to ''See No Evil'' and negotiated the deal with [[Warner Bros.]]&lt;ref name= "Tyrangiel"&gt;{{cite news| last = Tyrangiel| first = Josh| coauthors =| title = So, You Ever Kill Anybody?| work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]| pages =| language =| publisher =| date = November 13, 2005| url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1129565,00.html| accessdate = 2009-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaghan met Baer for lunch and then, for six weeks in 2002, the two men traveled from Washington to Geneva to the [[French Riviera]] to Lebanon, Syria and Dubai, meeting with lobbyists, arms dealers, oil traders, Arab officials and the spiritual leader of Hezbollah.&lt;ref name="Halbfinger"/&gt; Meeting Baer, Gaghan realized that the man had "gone out there and done and seen things that he was not allowed to talk about, and wouldn't, but he was angry about and also trying to make amends for."&lt;ref name="Halbfinger"/&gt; Before any filming took place, Gaghan convinced Warner Bros. to give him an unlimited research budget and no deadline.&lt;ref name="Tyrangiel"/&gt; He did his own legwork, meeting with oil traders in [[London, England|London]] and lawyers in Washington, D.C. Moments after arriving in Beirut in 2002, Gaghan was taken from the airport in a blindfold and hood where he met with Sheik [[Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah]], who was interested in films. He decided to grant the writer an audience even though he had not requested one. In addition, Gaghan dined with men suspected of killing former Lebanese Prime Minister [[Rafiq Hariri]] and met with former Defense Policy Board chairman [[Richard Perle]].&lt;ref name="Tyrangiel"/&gt;

Gaghan has cited as influences on ''Syriana'', European films like [[Roberto Rossellini]]'s ''[[Rome, Open City]]'', [[Costa Gavras]]' ''[[Z (1969 film)|Z]]'', and [[Gillo Pontecorvo]]'s ''[[The Battle of Algiers]]''.&lt;ref name= "Farber"&gt;{{cite news| last = Farber| first = Stephen| coauthors =| title = A Half-Dozen Ways to Watch the Same Movie| work = [[The New York Times]]| pages =| language =| publisher =| date = November 13, 2005| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/13/movies/13farb.html?scp=18&amp;sq=%22Syriana%22&amp;st=nyt| accessdate = 2009-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influence, or resource—one that might also explain the movie's use of a documentary clip featuring [[John D. Rockefeller]]—is the fact that Gaghan's fashion-designer wife [[Minnie Mortimer]] is the great-granddaughter of onetime [[Standard Oil]] executive Henry Morgan Tilford.

[[Harrison Ford]] turned down the role of Bob Barnes (the role played by George Clooney), regretting it later, stating, "I didn't feel strongly enough about the truth of the material and I think I made a mistake."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.tcm.ie/breakingnews/2006/03/04/story247617.asp Harrison Ford: 'I should have been in Syriana'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929110442/http://archives.tcm.ie/breakingnews/2006/03/04/story247617.asp |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the second Stephen Gaghan-written role Ford has declined, having turned down the role of Robert Wakefield in ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]'', a role that eventually went to [[Michael Douglas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Daly| first = Steve| title = Dope &amp; Glory| work = [[Entertainment Weekly]]| date = 2001-03-02| url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,280028,00.html| accessdate = 2009-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principal photography===
Gaghan shot in over 200 locations on four continents with 100 speaking parts.&lt;ref name="Farber"/&gt; ''Syriana'' originally had five storylines, all of which were filmed. The fifth storyline, centering on [[Michelle Monaghan]] playing a [[Miss USA]] who becomes involved with a rich Arab oilman, was cut when the film became too complicated.&lt;ref name="Grady"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farber"/&gt; Also, a role played by [[Greta Scacchi]], as Bob Barnes' wife, was also cut before the final release. Parts of the film were shot in Dubai and other parts of the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/how-hollywood-located-dubai-1.340635|title=How Hollywood located Dubai|author=Vinita Bharadwaj, Staff Reporter|work=GulfNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title==
The film's title is suggested to derive from the hypothesized ''[[Pax Syriana]],'' as an allusion to the necessary state of peace between Syria and the U.S. as it relates to the oil business. In a December 2005 interview, Baer told [[NPR]] that the title is a [[metaphor]] for foreign intervention in the Middle East, referring to post-[[World War II]] [[think tank]] strategic studies for the creation of an artificial state (such as [[Iraq]], created from elements of the former [[Ottoman Empire]]) that ensured continued western access to crude oil. The movie's website states that "‘Syriana’ is a real term used by Washington think-tanks to describe a hypothetical reshaping of the Middle East."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://syrianamovie.warnerbros.com/about.html|title=Syriana Blu-ray|work=www.WBShop.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaghan said he saw Syriana as "a great word that could stand for man's perpetual hope of remaking any geographic region to suit his own needs."&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Gaghan]]'s [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2005/11/14/DI2005111400923.html discussion] with [[Washington Post|''The Washington Post'']] in November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
The word ''Syriana'' derives from ''Syria'' + the Latin suffix ''-ana''; it means, roughly, "in the manner of Syria."  Historically, [[Syria]] refers not to the state that since 1944 has borne the name, but to a [[region of Syria|more extensive land]] stretching from the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea to the middle Euphrates River and the western edge of the desert steppe, and from the Tauric system of mountains in the north to the edge of the Sinai desert in the south.  This land was part of the [[Fertile Crescent]], and has historically been a geopolitically crucial junction for trade routes from the east, from Asia Minor and the Aegean, and from Egypt, and has long been a focus of great power conflicts.  The word ''Syria'' does not appear in the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew original of the Scriptures]], but appears in the [[Septuagint]] as the translation of [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]. Herodotus speaks of "Syrians" as identical with [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], but the term's geographical significance was not well defined in pre-Greek and Greek times. As an ethnic term, "Syrian" came to refer in Antiquity to [[Semitic people]]s living outside Mesopotamian and Arabian areas.  Greco-Roman administrations were the first to apply the term to a definite district.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 11th ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''Syriana'' was released on November 23, 2005 in limited release in only five theaters grossing $374,502 on its opening weekend. It went into wide release on December 9, 2005 in 1,752 theaters grossing $11.7 million on that weekend. It went on to make $50.8 million in North America and $43.1 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $93.9 million.&lt;ref name= "boxoffice"&gt;{{cite news| last =| first =| coauthors =| title = ''Syriana''| work = Box Office Mojo| pages =| language =| publisher =| date =| url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=syriana.htm| accessdate = 2009-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Censor authorities in some parts of the Middle East censored parts of the movie, because it depicted foreigners being ill-treated. Although abuse of foreign workers is rife, the censor authorities deemed such scenes as insulting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/dubai-censor-cuts-scenes-of-labour-abuse-from-syriana-6103242.html|title=Dubai censor cuts scenes of labour abuse from 'Syriana'|author=Jerome Taylor|date=20 April 2006|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Syriana'' received generally positive reviews. On the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it has a rating of 72% based on 196 reviews, with an average score of 6.9/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/syriana/|title=Syriana|date=9 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has a score of 76 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 40 critics indicating "Generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/syriana|title=Syriana|work=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a motion picture, the main criticism, even among reviewers who praised the film, was the confusion created by following numerous stories. Most critics stated that it was almost impossible to follow the plot, though some, notably [[Roger Ebert]], praised precisely that quality of the film and offered an interesting hidden story possibility (a covert deal between the U.S. and China involving oil being shipped through Kazakhstan and passed off as coming from a different source).&lt;ref name= "ebert"&gt;{{cite news| last = Ebert| first = Roger| coauthors =| title = ''Syriana''| work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]]| pages =| language =| publisher =| date = December 9, 2005| url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051208/REVIEWS/51130002/1023| accessdate = 2009-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The audience confusion mimics the confusion of the characters, who are enmeshed in the events around them without a clear understanding of what precisely is going on. As with Gaghan's screenplay for ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]'', ''Syriana'' uses multiple, parallel storylines, jumping from locations in [[Texas]], [[Washington D.C.]], [[Switzerland]], [[Spain]], and the [[Middle East]], leading film critic Ebert to describe the film as [[hyperlink cinema]].&lt;ref name= "ebert"/&gt;

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, "Gaghan relies on Clooney's agnostic heroism to lure viewers into his maze. When they get there, they will find not a conventionally satisfying movie but a kind of illustrated journalism: an engrossing, insider's tour of the world's hottest spots, grandest schemes and most dangerous men."&lt;ref name= "corliss"&gt;{{cite news| last = Corliss| first = Richard| coauthors =| title = A Thriller That Thinks| work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]| pages =| language =| publisher =| date = November 21, 2005| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1132826,00.html| accessdate = 2009-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Kenneth Turan wrote, "This is conspiracy-theory filmmaking of the most [[bravura]] kind, but if only a fraction of its suppositions are true, we—and the world—are in a world of trouble."&lt;ref name="turan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Turan |first=Kenneth |coauthors= |title=''Syriana'' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |pages= |language= |publisher= |date=November 23, 2005 |url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/turan/cl-et-syriana23nov23,0,7214793.story |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121200016/http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/turan/cl-et-syriana23nov23,0,7214793.story |archivedate=November 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, "Gaghan assumes his audience is smart enough to follow his explosive tour of global petro-politics. The result is thought-provoking and unnerving, emotionally engaging and intellectually stimulating."&lt;ref name= "puig"&gt;{{cite news| last = Puig| first = Claudia| coauthors =| title = ''Syriana'' explodes on the screen| work = [[USA Today]]| pages =| language =| publisher =| date = November 22, 2005| url = https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2005-11-22-syriana_x.htm| accessdate = 2009-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a "B−" rating and Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, "it's also the kind of movie that requires a viewer to work actively for comprehension, and to chalk up any lack of same to his or her own deficiency in the face of something so evidently smart."&lt;ref name= "schwarzbaum"&gt;{{cite news| last = Schwarzbaum| first = Lisa| coauthors =| title = ''Syriana''| work = [[Entertainment Weekly]]| pages =| language =| publisher =| date = November 22, 2005| url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1133637,00.html| accessdate = 2009-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review for ''[[The New York Observer]]'', [[Andrew Sarris]] wrote: "If anything, ''Syriana'' tends to oversimplify a mind-bogglingly multifaceted problem that cannot so easily be resolved by a diatribe against the supposedly all-powerful 'Americans.'"&lt;ref name= "sarris"&gt;{{cite news| last = Sarris| first = Andrew| coauthors =| title = Soderbergh, Clooney and Co.

Instead of complexity, there is a blank, uncompelling tangle, which conceals a kind of complacent political correctness."&lt;ref name= "bradshaw"&gt;{{cite news| last = Bradshaw| first = Peter| coauthors =| title = ''Syriana''| work = [[The Guardian]]| pages =| language =| publisher =| date = March 3, 2006| url = https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/mar/03/1| accessdate = 2009-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technology management''' is a set of [[management]] disciplines that allows organizations to manage their [[technology|technological]] fundamentals to create [[competitive advantage]]. Typical concepts used in technology management are:
* technology strategy (a logic or role of technology in organization), 
* [[technology forecasting]] (identification of possible relevant technologies for the organization, possibly through [[technology scouting]]),
* [[technology roadmap]] (mapping technologies to business and market needs), and 
* technology project portfolio (a set of projects under development) and technology portfolio (a set of technologies in use).
The role of the technology management function in an organization is to understand the value of certain technology for the organization. Continuous development of technology is valuable as long as there is a value for the customer and therefore the technology management function in an organization should be able to argue when to invest on technology development and when to withdraw.

== Overview ==
Technology management can  also be defined as the integrated planning, design, optimization, operation and control of technological products, processes and services, a better definition would be the management of the use of technology for human advantage.

The [[Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering]] defines technology management as the field concerned with the supervision of personnel across the technical spectrum and a wide variety of complex technological systems. Technology management programs typically include instruction in production and operations management, project management, computer applications, quality control, safety and health issues, statistics, and general management principles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://atmae.site-ym.com/?page=AboutATMAE ATMAE Venn Diagram]&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most authoritative input to our understanding of technology is the [[diffusion of innovations]] theory developed in the first half of the twentieth  century. It suggests that all innovations follow a similar diffusion pattern – best known today in the form of an "s" curve though originally based upon the concept of a standard distribution of adopters. In broad terms the "s" curve suggests four phases of a technology life cycle – ''emerging'', ''growth'', ''mature'' and ''aging''.

These four phases are coupled to increasing levels of acceptance of an [[innovation]] or, in our case a new technology. In recent times for many technologies an inverse curve – which corresponds to a declining cost per unit – has been postulated. This may not prove to be universally true though for information technology where much of the cost is in the initial phase it has been a reasonable expectation.

The second major contribution to this area is the Carnegie Mellon [[Capability Maturity Model]]. This model proposes that a series of progressive capabilities can be quantified through a set of threshold tests. These tests determine ''repeatability'', ''definition'', ''management'' and ''optimization''. The model suggests that any organization has to master one level before being able to proceed to the next.

The third significant contribution comes from Gartner – the research service, it is the [[hype cycle]], this suggests that our modern approach to marketing technology results in the technology being over hyped in the early stages of growth. Taken together, these fundamental concepts provide a foundation for formalizing the approach to managing technology.

==Mobile device management ==

[[Mobile device management]] (MDM) is the administrative area dealing with deploying, securing, monitoring, integrating and managing mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets and laptops, in the workplace and other areas. The intent of MDM is to optimize the functionality and security of mobile devices within the enterprise, while simultaneously protecting the corporate network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/definition/mobile-device-management|title=What is mobile device management (MDM)? - Definition from WhatIs.com|author=|date=|website=techtarget.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; MDM is usually implemented with the use of a third party product that has management features for particular vendors of mobile devices.

== Accreditation and certification ==

The [[Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering]] (ATMAE), accredits selected collegiate programs in technology management. An instructor or graduate of a technology management program may choose to become a Certified Technology Manager (CTM) by sitting for a rigorous exam administered by ATMAE covering production planning &amp; control, safety, quality, and management/supervision.

'''Trade diversion''' is an [[economic]] term related to [[international economics]] in which [[trade]] is diverted from a more efficient exporter towards a less [[productive efficiency|efficient]] one by the formation of a [[free trade agreement]] or a [[customs union]]. Total cost of good becomes cheaper when trading within the agreement because of the low tariff. This is as compared to trading with countries outside the agreement with lower cost goods but higher tariff. The related term '''Trade creation''' is when the formation of a trade agreement between countries decreases of price of the goods for more consumers, and therefore increases overall trade. In this case the more efficient producer with the agreement increases trade.{{r|viner}}

The terms were used by [[Chicago school of economics|'old' Chicago School]] economist [[Jacob Viner]] in his 1950 paper ''The Customs Union Issue''.{{r|viner}}

==Notable uses==
An early use of the terms was by Jacob Viner in his 1950 paper ''The Customs Union Issue''.{{r|viner|viner2}} Later in same decade [[Richard Lipsey]] noted that not only the location of production but also the location of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of goods would be effected by trade agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lipsey|first=Richard G.|date=1957|title=The Theory of Customs Unions: Trade Diversion and Welfare|jstor=2551626|journal=Economica|volume=24|issue=93|pages=40–46|doi=10.2307/2551626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Béla Balassa]] discussed the concepts in relation to the [[European Economic Community|European Common Market]] in his paper 1967 ''Trade Creation and Trade Diversion in the European Common Market''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Balassa|first=Bela|date=1967|title=Trade Creation and Trade Diversion in the European Common Market|jstor=2229344|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=77|issue=305|pages=1–21|doi=10.2307/2229344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Paul Oslington]]'s ''Contextual History, Practitioner History, and Classic Status: Reading Jacob Viner’s The Customs Union Issue reviewed'' revisited Viner's original paper.{{r|viner2}}

==Occurrence==

When a country applies the same tariff to all nations, it will always import from the most efficient producer, since the more efficient nation will provide the goods at a lower price. With the establishment of a bilateral or regional free trade agreement, that may not be the case.
If the agreement is signed with a less-efficient nation, it may well be that their products become cheaper in the importing market than those from the more-efficient nation, since there are taxes for only one of them. Consequently, after the establishment of the agreement, the importing country would acquire products from a higher-cost producer, instead of the low-cost producer from which it was importing until then. In other words, this would cause a trade diversion.

==Term==
The term was coined by [[Jacob Viner]] in ''The Customs Union Issue'' in 1950. In its literal meaning the term was however incomplete, as it failed to capture all welfare effects of discriminatory tariff liberalization, and it was not useful when it came to non-tariff barriers. Economists have however dealt with this incompleteness in two ways. Either they stretched the original meaning to cover all welfare effects, or they introduced new terms like [[trade expansion]] or internal versus external trade creation.

Viner's article became and still is the foundation of the theory of international economic integration. It considered only two states comparing their trade flows with the rest of the world after they abolish customs tariffs on inner border of their union. Following the fact that economic unions most often include more than 2 states, attempts have been made to increase the number of the states (3+world), but not so successfully, as they did not have as clear conclusions as Viner's.

Opposite to economically efficient trade creation effect, the trade diversion flow is cost-inefficient compared with the rest of the world. Balance between trade creation and trade diversion effects due to the creation of economic union makes the union either economically efficient (positive balance) or inefficient (negative balance). It is based on the fact that unification of states usually applies mergers of more than 1 sector in economy (even European Coal and Steel Union, which had 2 sectors only) leading to the creation of either trade creation or diversion effects.

Positive effects of trade diversion include increase of trade between unified states, increase of employment in manufacturing states inside the union consequently leading to increase of respective taxes and welfare.

== Downside==
Diverted trade may hurt the non-member nation economically and politically, and create a strained relationship between the two nations. The decreased output of the good or service traded from one nation with a high comparative advantage to a nation of lower comparative advantage works against creating more efficiency and therefore against more overall surplus. It is  widely believed by economists that trade diversion is harmful to consumers.
The dynamics of trade diversion was described by Ravshanbek Dalimov in 2009. He used similarity of trade flows to the flux of gas or liquid stimulated by the pressure difference, while the flows of trade flows are stimulated by the price difference. This allowed use of [[Navier-Stokes equations]] for the interregional dynamics of trade flows.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

After [[September 11 attacks|September 11]] and the advent of the wars in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]], WorldCell shifted its focus&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, Neil. "As Economy Stalled, Firms Revamped to Stay Afloat. ''Financial Times Information Ltd.'' 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; to providing wireless management services to corporations, federal agencies, and the US military, transitioning its rental service to its '''TravelComm''' division.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Nicholas.
