'''World Achva Association''' ({{lang-he|אחווה}}) is [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox Jewish]] [[secret society]] was founded in 1895 and aims to mutual assistance and real existence of the [[Mitzvah]] "Love your neighbor as yourself".

The world head bureau is located in [[Jerusalem]] from the association establishment to the present.

== Establishment and goals ==
First Bureau of the Association was founded in [[Jerusalem]] to unify with [[Israel]], develop the education, improve the morals of the people and help the needy. Among other things, requested the Association to help friends, called "Brothers," on the one hand they are very moral but on the other financially weak. Help included assistance in finding jobs, and providing [[credit (finance)|credit]].

Fraternity brothers are divided into four different levels, ranging from 'trainees' are "following siblings learn the theory of brotherhood" to 'educate' they "There are those who go to the fraternity of complete self-forgetfulness. They have no calculates interest on themselves when they give their hands brotherhood, not later, not any time any day, but always they feel only the second and always are willing to give themselves and dedicate themselves for the other. few are unique individuals but this fraternity Hasmonean. role of these brotherhood serve as a symbol to others and play are without intention special role of educators".

==Association Activity==
After the establishment of the branch in Jerusalem, opened branches in [[Jaffa]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Safed]], [[Tiberias]], [[Hebron]], [[Petah Tikva]], [[Haifa]], [[New York City]] and [[London]].

In recent decades, the association activity in Israel almost completely diminished and most of the activities currently being branches in [[Australia]], [[England]], [[Argentina]], [[United States]], [[Brazil]], [[South Africa]], [[France]] and [[Canada]].

==Achva neighborhood==
In 1905 suggested that some members of the Neighborhood Association to establish themselves in Jerusalem, and in 1906 was purchased in the name of two members of the Association nationals [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] A, Land to build Achva neighborhood. Neighborhood construction work was entrusted to the members of the Association of Contractors Abraham Hamburger and in-law Jacob Moses from, and two years later established neighborhood. The neighborhood is located between the neighborhoods of Jerusalem [[Zichron Moshe]] and the Street Kings of Israel.

Book of regulations to establish the neighborhood stated: "We have come to the Soviet drive us the seat change and twenty houses, a house and a yard each, with [[synagogue]] built as loud to the Torah and to the [[prayer]] ... and called colony name Rates brotherhood, for the will We name a good sign that this project will have as big gate wide open".

In 1899 Achva neighborhood was founded in Jaffa, south-west of [[Neve Tzedek]] and to the [[Neve Shalom]], initiated by Elijah Aharon Kahana.

In 1905, the Association [[Talmud Torah]] in Jaffa has been established which joined with the [[Biblical studies|Bible study]] little [[secular]]. They called the place "brotherly room" and many of the local Haredi community supported him. In 1908 studied the eighty students. Administrator Heder appointed Dr. Joseph Halevi Seliger great support of Jaffa - Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]]. The name of the institution changed to "Tachkemoni", and prepared a plan which included studies - SECONDARY.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12377">'''Actinorhizal plants'''  are a group of [[angiosperms]] characterized by their ability to form a [[symbiosis]] with the [[nitrogen fixing]] [[actinobacteria]] ''[[Frankia]]''. This association leads to the formation of nitrogen-fixing root nodules.

==Classification==

Actinorhizal plants are [[dicotyledon]]s distributed among three [[angiosperm]] [[Order (biology)|orders]], 8 [[Family (biology)|families]] and 24 [[Genus|genera]]:&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Wall|2000"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wall|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These three orders form a single [[clade]] within the [[Rosids]], which is a sister taxon to the other major nitrogen-fixing order, the [[Fabales]]. All actinorhizal species are trees or shrubs, except for the genus ''[[Datisca]]''.

Many are common plants in temperate regions like [[alder]], [[Myrica|bayberry]], [[Comptonia (plant)|sweetfern]], [[Dryas (plant)|Avens]], [[mountain misery]] and ''[[Coriaria]]''. Some ''[[Elaeagnus]]'' species and [[Sea-buckthorn]]s produce edible fruit. In tropical regions, ''[[Casuarina]]s'' are widely cultivated.

==Distribution and ecology==
[[File:Actinorhizal Plant Distribution.svg|thumb|right|The distribution of actinorhizal plants.]]
Actinorhizal plants are found on all continents except for [[Antarctica]]. Their ability to form nitrogen-fixing nodules confers a selective advantage in poor soils. Most actinorhizal plants are therefore [[pioneer species]] that colonize young soils where available [[nitrogen]] is scarce like [[moraine]]s, volcanic flows or sand dunes.&lt;ref name="Schwintzer 1990"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schwintzer|Tjepkema|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being among the first species to colonize these disturbed environments, actinorhizal shrubs and trees play a critical role, enriching the soil and enabling the establishment of other species in an [[ecological succession]].&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Wall|2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwintzer 1990"/&gt; Actinorhizal plants like alders are also common in the [[riparian forest]].&lt;ref name="Schwintzer 1990"/&gt;

Actinorhizal plants are the major contributors to nitrogen fixation in broad areas of the world, and are particularly important in [[temperate forest]].&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Wall|2000"/&gt; The nitrogen fixation rate measured for some [[alder]] species is as high as 300&amp;nbsp;kg of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/ha/year, close to the highest rate reported in [[legumes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zavitovski|Newton|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary origin==

No fossil records are available concerning nodules, but fossil pollen of plants similar to modern actinorhizal species has been found in sediments deposited 87 million years ago. The origin of the symbiotic association remains uncertain. The ability to associate with ''Frankia'' is a [[polyphyletic]] character and has probably evolved independently in different [[clade]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Benson|Clawson|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, actinorhizal plants and Legumes, the two major nitrogen-fixing groups of plants share a relatively close ancestor, as they are all part of a [[clade]] within the [[rosid]]s which is often called the ''nitrogen-fixing clade''. This ancestor may have developed a "predisposition" to enter into symbiosis with nitrogen fixing bacteria and this led to the independent acquisition of symbiotic abilities by ancestors of the actinorhizal and Legume species. The genetic program used to establish the symbiosis has probably recruited elements of the arbuscular [[mycorrhiza]]l symbioses, a much older and widely distributed symbiotic association between plants and fungi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kistner|Parniske|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==The symbiotic nodules==

As in legumes, [[root nodule|nodulation]] is favored by nitrogen deprivation and is inhibited by high nitrogen concentrations. Depending on the plant species, two mechanisms of infection have been described: The first is observed in  casuarinas or alders and is called root hair infection. In this case the infection begins with an intracellular infection of a [[root hair]] and is followed by the formation of a primitive symbiotic organ lacking any particular organization, a prenodule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Laplaze|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second mechanism of infection is called intercellular entry and is well described in ''Discaria'' species. In this case bacteria penetrate the root extracellularly, growing between epidermal cells then between cortical cells. Later on ''Frankia'' becomes intracellular but no prenodule is formed. In both cases the infection leads to cell divisions in the pericycle and the formation of a new organ consisting of several lobes anatomically similar to a lateral root. This organ is the actinorhizal nodule also called [[actinorhizae]]. Cortical cells of the nodule are invaded by ''Frankia'' filaments coming from the site of infection or the prenodule. Actinorhizal nodules have generally an indeterminate growth, new cells are therefore continually produced at the apex and successively become infected. Mature cells of the nodule are filled with bacterial filaments that actively fix nitrogen.

Little information is available concerning the mechanisms leading to nodulation. No equivalent of the rhizobial [[Nod factor]]s have been found, but several genes known to participate in the formation and functioning of Legume nodules (coding for heamoglobin and other nodulins)  are also found in actinorhizal plants where they are supposed to play similar roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vessey|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of genetic tools in ''Frankia'' and in actinorhizal species was the main factor explaining such a poor understating of this symbiosis,  but  the recent sequencing of 3 ''Frankia'' genomes &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Normand|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the development of [[RNAi]] and [[genomic]] tools in actinorhizal species &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hocher|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gherbi|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; should help to a far better understanding in the following years.

A '''bond beam''' is a horizontal structural element, usually found as an embedded part of a masonry wall assembly. The bond beam serves to impart horizontal strength to a wall where it may not otherwise be braced by floor or roof structure. Bond beams encase steel reinforcing in [[grout]] or concrete, binding the structure together horizontally, and often interlocking with additional vertical reinforcement. A bond beam is typically found near the top of a freestanding wall. A bond beam may also be used to provide a consistent anchorage for floor or roof structure. Bond beam assemblies are most commonly used in construction using [[concrete masonry unit]]s, where special shapes allow the beam to blend with the wall construction, but may also be built using brick or may be formed in concrete.&lt;ref name=beall1&gt;{{cite book|last=Beall|first=Christine|title=Masonry Design and Detailing for Architects, Engineers and Builders|year=1987|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-004223-3|pages=66–67,290, 320, 365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Botanical nomenclature''' is the formal, scientific naming of plants. It is related to, but distinct from [[Alpha taxonomy|taxonomy]]. Plant taxonomy is concerned with grouping and classifying plants; botanical nomenclature then provides names for the results of this process. The starting point for modern botanical nomenclature is  [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]' ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' of 1753. Botanical nomenclature is governed by the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (''ICN''), which replaces the ''International Code of Botanical Nomenclature'' (''ICBN''). [[Fossil plant]]s are also covered by the code of nomenclature.

Within the limits set by that code there is another set of rules, the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants|International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (ICNCP)]]'' which applies to plant [[cultivar]]s that have been deliberately altered or selected by humans (see [[cultigen]]).

==History and scope==

Botanical nomenclature has a long history, going back beyond the period when Latin was the scientific language throughout Europe, to [[Theophrastus]] (c. 370–287 BC), [[Dioscorides]] (c. 40 – 90 AD) and other [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] writers. Many of these works have come down to us in [[Latin]] translations. The principal Latin writer on botany was [[Pliny the Elder]] (23–79 AD). From Mediaeval times, Latin became the universal scientific language ([[lingua franca]]) in Europe. Most written plant knowledge was the property of monks, particularly [[Benedictine]], and the purpose of those early [[herbals]] was primarily medicinal rather than plant science ''per se''. It would require the invention of the [[printing press]] (1450) to make such information more widely available.{{sfn|Stearn|1992}}{{sfn|Stearn|2002}}{{sfn|Pavord|2005}}

[[Leonhart Fuchs]], a German physician and botanist is often considered the originator of Latin names for the rapidly increasing number of plants known to science. For instance he coined the name ''[[Digitalis]]'' in his ''[[De Historia Stirpium Commentarii Insignes]]'' (1542).

A key event was [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus’]] adoption of [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial names]] for plant species in his ''Species Plantarum'' (1753).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Barkworth |first=M. |year=2004 |title=Botanical Nomenclature (Nomenclature, Names, and Taxonomy) |publisher=University of Utah |url=http://herbarium.usu.edu/teaching/4420/botnom.htm |accessdate=2011-02-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wdX3kH4m?url=http://herbarium.usu.edu/teaching/4420/botnom.htm |archivedate=2011-02-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century it became increasingly clear that there was a need for rules to govern scientific nomenclature, and initiatives were taken to refine the  body of laws initiated by Linnaeus. These were published in successively more sophisticated editions. For plants, key dates are 1867 (''lois'' de Candolle) and 1906 (''International Rules of Botanical Nomenclature'', 'Vienna Rules'). The most recent is the ''Melbourne Code'', adopted in 2011.&lt;ref name=MelbourneCode&gt;{{cite book |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G. Gantner Verlag KG  |isbn=978-3-87429-425-6 |url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=title }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another development was the insight into the delimitation of the concept of 'plant'. Gradually more and more groups of organisms are being recognised as being independent of plants. Nevertheless, the formal names of most of these organisms are governed by the (ICN), even today. Some [[protist]]s that do not fit easily into either plant or animal categories are treated under either or both of the ICN and the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]]. A separate ''Code'' was adopted to govern the nomenclature of Bacteria, the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria]]''.

==Relationship to taxonomy==
Botanical nomenclature is closely linked to plant taxonomy, and botanical nomenclature serves plant taxonomy, but nevertheless botanical nomenclature is separate from plant taxonomy. Botanical nomenclature is merely the body of rules prescribing which name applies to that taxon (see [[correct name (botany)|correct name]]) and if a new name may (or must) be coined.

Plant [[alpha taxonomy|taxonomy]] is an empirical science, a science that determines what constitutes a particular [[taxon]] (taxonomic grouping, plural: taxa): e.g. "What plants belong to this species?" and "What species belong to this genus?". The definition of the limits of a taxon is called its '[[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]]'. For a particular taxon, if two taxonomists agree exactly on its circumscription, [[rank (taxonomy)|rank]] and position (i.e. the higher rank in which it is included) then there is only one name which can apply under the ''ICN''.&lt;ref&gt;McNeill et al. 2012, Principle IV&lt;/ref&gt; Where they differ in opinion on any of these issues, one and the same plant may be placed in taxa with different names. As an example, consider Siehe's Glory-of-the-Snow, ''[[Chionodoxa siehei]]'':
[[Image:Chionodoxa siehei closeup.jpg|thumb|Flowers of ''Chionodoxa siehei'', which can also be called ''Scilla siehei'', or included in ''Chionodoxa forbesii'' or in ''Scilla forbesii'']]
* Taxonomists can disagree as to whether two groups of plants are sufficiently distinct to be put into one species or not. Thus ''[[Chionodoxa siehei]]'' and ''[[Chionodoxa forbesii]]'' have been treated as a single species by some taxonomists or as two species by others.&lt;ref name="DashwoodMathew2005"&gt;{{Citation |last=Dashwood |first=Melanie |last2=Mathew |first2=Brian |year=2005 |title=Hyacinthaceae – little blue bulbs (RHS Plant Trials and Awards, Bulletin Number 11) |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |url=http://www.rhs.org.uk/getattachment/04d1dd16-01be-4c31-9510-8a081dfa23b0/Hyacinthaceae---Little-Blue-Bulbs-Bulletin.aspx |accessdate=19 February 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wdYF0E05?url=http://www.rhs.org.uk/getattachment/04d1dd16-01be-4c31-9510-8a081dfa23b0/Hyacinthaceae---Little-Blue-Bulbs-Bulletin.aspx |archivedate=20 February 2011 |lastauthoramp=yes |deadurl=yes |df= }}, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; If treated as one species, the earlier published name must be used,&lt;ref name="MelbIII"&gt;McNeill et al. 2012, Principle III&lt;/ref&gt; so plants previously called ''Chionodoxa siehei'' become ''Chionodoxa forbesii''.
* Taxonomists can disagree as to whether two genera are sufficiently distinct to be kept separate or not. While agreeing that the genus ''[[Chionodoxa]]'' is closely related to the genus ''[[Scilla]]'', nevertheless the bulb specialist [[Brian Mathew]] considers that their differences warrant maintaining separate genera.&lt;ref name="DashwoodMathew2005"/&gt; Others disagree, and would refer to ''Chionodoxa siehei'' as ''Scilla siehei''. The earliest published genus name must be used when genera are merged;&lt;ref name="MelbIII"/&gt; in this case ''Scilla'' was published earlier and is used (not ''Chionodoxa'').
* Taxonomists can disagree as to the limits of families. When the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] (APG) first published its classification of the flowering plants in 1998, ''Chionodoxa siehei'' would have been placed in the family Hyacinthaceae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Angiosperm Phylogeny Group |year=1998 |title=An ordinal classification for the families of flowering plants |journal=Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden |volume=85 |issue=4 |pages=531–553 |url=http://www.bergianska.se/pub/publikationer/Bremer/Angiosperm_et_al_1998.pdf |accessdate=2011-02-19 |doi=10.2307/2992015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2009 revision of their classification, the APG no longer recognize the Hyacinthaceae as a separate family, merging it into a greatly enlarged family [[Asparagaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Angiosperm Phylogeny Group III |year=2009 |title=An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG III |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=105–121 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.00996.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''Chionodoxa siehei'' moves from the Hyacinthaceae to the Asparagaceae.
* Taxonomists can disagree as to the rank of a taxon. Rather than allow the Hyacinthaceae to disappear altogether, Chase et al. suggested that it be treated as a subfamily within the Asparagaceae.&lt;ref name="Chase2009"&gt;{{Citation |last=Chase |first=M.W. |last2=Reveal |first2=J.L. |last3=Fay |first3=M.F. |year=2009 |title=A subfamilial classification for the expanded asparagalean families Amaryllidaceae, Asparagaceae and Xanthorrhoeaceae|journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=132–136|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.00999.x |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ICN'' requires family names to end with "-aceae" and subfamily names to end with "-oideae".&lt;ref&gt;McNeill et al. 2012, Article 19.1&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a possible name for the Hyacinthaceae when treated as a subfamily would be 'Hyacinthoideae'. However, the name [[Scilloideae]] had already been published in 1835 as the name for a subfamily containing the genus ''Scilla'', so this name has priority and must be used.&lt;ref name="Chase2009"/&gt; Hence for those taxonomists who accept  the APG system of 2009, ''Chionodoxa siehei'' can be placed in the subfamily Scilloideae of the family Asparagaceae. However, a taxonomist is perfectly free to continue to argue that Hyacinthaceae should be maintained as a separate family from the other families which were merged into the Asparagaceae.

In summary, if a plant has different names or is placed in differently named taxa:  
* If the confusion is purely nomenclatural, i.e. it concerns what to call a taxon which has the same circumscription, rank and position, the ''ICN'' provides rules to settle the differences, typically by prescribing that the earliest published name must be used, although names can be [[conservation (botany)|conserved]]. 
* If the confusion is taxonomic, i.e. taxonomists differ in opinion on the circumscription, rank or position of taxa, then only more scientific research can settle the differences, and [[Lumpers and splitters|even then only sometimes]].

The '''Centre of Planning and Economic Research''' (KEPE) was established in 1959 as a research unit, under the title "Centre for Economic Research", to study the challenges faced by the [[Greek economy]] and encourage economic research in Greece and further cooperation with other scientific institutions.

In 1964, KEPE acquired its present name and organizational structure along with the additional charges of preparing [[development plans]], analyzing contemporary developments in the Greek economy, engaging in short and medium-term forecasts, formulating proposals for development policies and training young economists in the fields of planning and economic development.

Today, KEPE is a leading economics [[research institute]] in Greece. It focuses on applied research projects concerning the Greek economy, and provides expert advice to the Greek government on economic and social policy issues.

KEPE is governed by a board of directors appointed by the Minister for Development and Competitiveness. 
Research Fellows at KEPE concentrate on four areas of empirical research: (a) [[macroeconomic]] analysis and projections, (b) [[fiscal policy|fiscal]] and [[monetary policy]], (c) human resources and social policies, and (d) [[sectoral analysis]] and policy.

The Centre's research output includes publications in the following series:
*Studies, i.e., monographs which investigate specific economic issues through the application of modern analytical methods.
*Reports, i.e., works which analyse in a systematic manner sectoral, regional, or national economic issues.
*Discussion Papers, i.e., papers on ongoing research projects.
*Research collaborations, i.e., research projects prepared in cooperation with other research institutes.
*A four-monthly review, entitled Greek Economic Outlook.
*A monthly review, entitled Greek Economy.

Apart from the above publications, KEPE has is very active in the production of unpublished studies, reports and position papers assigned by ministries or other bodies, aimed at supporting economic policy decisions.

KEPE runs a specialised [[research library]], with a rich collection of Greek and international books and journals in economics and social sciences at large. In addition, KEPE is in contact with similar foreign institutions, and exchanges publications, views and information on current economic developments and research methods.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kepe.gr&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coal pollution mitigation''', often referred to by the term '''clean coal''', is a series of systems and technologies that seek to mitigate the pollution and other environmental effects normally associated with the burning (though not the [[coal mining|mining]] or processing) of [[coal]], which is widely regarded as the dirtiest of the common fuels for industrial processes and power generation.&lt;ref name="NatGeoMyth"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2014/04/coal/nijhuis-text|title=Can Coal Ever Be Clean?|last=Nijhuis|first=Michelle|date=April 2014|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approaches attempt to mitigate emissions of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and other [[greenhouse gas]]es, and [[naturally occurring radioactive material|radioactive material]]s, that arise from the use of coal, mainly for electrical power generation, using [[Coal pollution mitigation technology|various technologies]]. Historical efforts to reduce coal pollution focused on [[flue-gas desulfurization]] starting in the 1850s and clean burn technologies.  These efforts have been very successful in countries with strong environmental regulation, such as the US, where emissions of acid-rain causing compounds and particulates have been reduced by up to 90%&lt;ref&gt;https://www3.epa.gov/airmarkets/progress/reports/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; since 1995. More recent developments include [[carbon capture and storage]], which pumps and stores CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions underground, and [[integrated gasification combined cycle]] (IGCC) involve [[coal gasification]], which provides a basis for increased efficiency and lower cost in capturing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TECH/07/13/carbon.capture.storage/ |title=Countries betting tech can clean up coal  – IB89005: Global Climate Change |publisher=CNN International |date=July 13, 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718230924/http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TECH/07/13/carbon.capture.storage/ |archivedate=July 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/20090716/daily-wrap-july-16-energy.htm |publisher= International Business Times |title= Daily Wrap Up for July 16 – Energy |date= July 16, 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theage.com.au/environment/divided-views-over-clean-coal-pilot-project-20090708-ddf5.html |publisher= The Age |title= Divided views over 'clean coal' pilot project |date= July 9, 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-17 | location=Melbourne | first=Adam | last=Morton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25738096-11949,00.html |publisher= The Australian |title= Make-or-break summit as G8 gamble on climate and economy  |date= July 6, 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/cleancoal/86-93program.html |title= The 1986–93 Clean Coal Technology Program |publisher= US Department of Energy|date= 21 April 2011 |accessdate=2011-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 22 clean coal demonstration projects funded by the U.S. Department of Energy since 2003, none are in operation as of February 2017, having been abandoned or delayed due to capital budget overruns or discontinued because of excessive operating expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clean Coal Power Initiative|url=https://energy.gov/fe/science-innovation/clean-coal-research/major-demonstrations/clean-coal-power-initiative|website=Energy.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy Office of Fossil Energy|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations==
Since the 1970s, various policy and regulatory measures have driven coal pollution mitigation.  In the US, the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] was the primary driving force in reducing particulate emissions and acid rain from coal combustion. As regulations have increased the demand for coal pollution mitigation technologies, costs have fallen and performance has improved.&lt;ref name=IEA_Coal&gt;{{cite web|title=Clean Coal Technologies: Accelerating Commercial and Policy Drivers for Deployment|url=https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/Clean_Coal_CIAB_2008.pdf|website=www.iea.org|publisher=International Energy Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread deployment of pollution-control equipment to reduce [[sulphur dioxide]], NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and dust emissions is just one example that brought cleaner air to many countries. The desire to tackle rising CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions to address [[climate change]] later introduced [[Carbon capture and storage|Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)]].&lt;ref name=IEA_Coal/&gt;

Within the United States, [[Carbon Capture and Storage]] technologies, also sometimes referred to as carbon capture and sequestration, are mainly being developed in response to regulations by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]—most notably the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]]—and in anticipation of legislation that seeks to mitigate [[climate change]].

[[Loan guarantees]] and [[tax incentives]] have a long history of use in [[Australia]], [[Member state of the European Union|EU countries]] and the US to encourage the introduction of coal pollution mitigation and other technologies to reduce environmental impact.&lt;ref name=IEA_Coal/&gt;

{{main|Greenhouse gas}}

Combustion of coal--which is mostly carbon--produces carbon dioxide as a product of combustion.  According to the [[United Nations]] [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], the burning of coal, a [[fossil fuel]], is a significant contributor to [[global warming]]. (See the UN [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]]). For 1 ton of coal burned, 2.86 tons of carbon dioxide is created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/coal/production/quarterly/co2_article/co2.html|title= Carbon Dioxide Emission Factors for Coal, Energy Information Administration, Quarterly Coal Report, January–April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carbon sequestration]] technology has yet to be tested on a large scale and may not be safe or successful. Sequestered CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may eventually leak up through the ground, may lead to unexpected geological instability or may cause contamination of aquifers used for drinking water supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.awwa.org/publications/MainStreamArticle.cfm?itemnumber=39815 | title=AWWA warns Congress about {{CO2}} injection concerns | publisher=American Water Works }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As 25.5% of the world's electrical generation in 2004 was from coal-fired generation (see [[world energy consumption]]), reaching the carbon dioxide reduction targets of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] will require modifications to how coal is used.&lt;ref name="ncseonline.org"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ncseonline.org/NLE/CRSreports/Climate/clim-2.cfm?&amp;CFID=1255395&amp;CFTOKEN=96369856 |title= CRS Issue Brief for Congress – IB89005: Global Climate Change |publisher= National Council for Science and the Environment |date= August 13, 2001 |accessdate= 2008-09-13 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081226020613/http://www.ncseonline.org/NLE/CRSreports/Climate/clim-2.cfm?&amp;CFID=1255395&amp;CFTOKEN=96369856 |archivedate= December 26, 2008 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combustion By-products===
By-products of coal combustion are compounds which are released into the atmosphere as a result of burning coal.  Coal includes contaminants such as sulfur compounds and non-combustible minerals.  When coal is burned, the minerals become ash (i.e [[particulate matter]] or PM) and the sulfur forms sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  Since air is mostly [[nitrogen]], combustion of coal often leads to production of [[nitrogen oxide]]s. [[Sulfur  dioxide]] and [[nitrogen oxide]]s are primary causes of [[acid rain]].  For many years--before greenhouse gasses were widely understood to be a threat-- it was thought that these by-products were the only drawback to using coal.  These by-products are still a problem, but they have been greatly diminished in most advanced countries due to clean air regulations.
It is possible to remove most of the sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrogen oxide]]s (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[Particulates|particulate matter]] (PM) emissions from the coal-burning process.   For example, various techniques are used in a [[coal preparation plant]] to reduce the amount of non-combustible matter (i.e. ash) in the coal prior to burning.  During combustion, [[fluidized bed combustion]] is used to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions.  After burning, particulate matter (i.e. ash and dust) can be reduced using an [[electrostatic precipitator]] and sulfur dioxide emissions can be further reduced with [[Flue-gas desulfurization]].  Trace amounts of [[radionuclide]]s are more difficult to remove.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Coal-fired power plants are the largest aggregate source of the toxic heavy metal [[mercury (element)|mercury]]: 50 tons per year come from coal power plants out of 150 tons emitted nationally in the USA and 5000 tons globally. However, according to the United States Geological Survey, the trace amounts of mercury in coal by-products do not pose a threat to public health.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |title=Coal Combustion: Nuclear Resource or Danger? |author=Alex Gabbard |accessdate=2008-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205103749/http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html |archivedate=2007-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2013 found that Mercury found in the fish in the Pacific Ocean could possibly be linked to coal-fired plants in Asia.

==Potential financial impact==
Whether carbon capture and storage technology is adopted worldwide will “…depend less on science than on economics. Cleaning coal is very expensive.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123751110892790871|title=Coal Hard Facts: Cleaning It Won't Be Dirt Cheap|last=Ball|first=Jeffrey|date=2009-03-20|website=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost of converting a single coal-fired power plant===
Conversion of a conventional coal-fired power plant is done by injecting the {{CO2}} into [[ammonium carbonate]] after which it is then transported and deposited underground (preferably in soil beneath the sea).&lt;ref name="Can coal ever be clean"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2014/04/coal/nijhuis-text|title=Can Coal Ever Be Clean?|last=Nijhuis|first=Michelle|date=April 2014|website=National Geographic|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This injection process however is by far the most expensive. Besides the cost of the equipment and the ammonium carbonate, the coal-fired power plant also needs to use 30% of its generated heat to do the injection (parasitic load). A test-setup has been done in the American Electric Power Mountaineer coal-burning power plant.

One solution to reduce this thermal loss/parasitic load is to burn the pulverised load with [[pure oxygen]] instead of air.&lt;ref name="Can coal ever be clean"/&gt;

===Cost implications for new coal-fired power plants===
Newly built coal-fired power plants can be made to immediately use gasification of the coal prior to combustion. This makes it much easier to separate off the {{CO2}} from the exhaust fumes, making the process cheaper. This gasification process is done in new coal-burning power plants such as the coal-burning power plant at [[Tianjin]], called "[[GreenGen]]".

===Costs for US-wide conversion===
The projected nationwide costs for the implementing of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in coal-fired power plants in the USA (presumably using a conventional tactic, see above) can be found in the Wall Street Journal article. Credit Suisse Group says $15 billion needs to be invested in CCS over the next 10 years for it to play an important role in climate change. The [[International Energy Agency]] says $20 billion is needed. The [[Pew Center on Global Climate Change]] says the number is as high as $30 billion. Those figures dwarf the actual investments to date.

In the US, the Bush administration spent about $2.5 billion on [[Coal pollution mitigation technology|a range of mitigation technologies]] — a large amount, but far less than the amounts previously suggested. CCS proponents say both the government and the private sector need to step up their investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/energy/2009/03/17/why-clean-coal-is-years-away.html?PageNr=1|title=US News, Why clean coal is years away|last=|first=|date=2009-03-17|newspaper=US News|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329044452/http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/energy/2009/03/17/why-clean-coal-is-years-away.html?PageNr=1|archive-date=2009-03-29|dead-url=yes|work=|via=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential financial benefits ===
The coal industry in the US has the potential to make billions of dollars if clean coal technologies are pursued. It is estimated that from 2000 to 2020 the industry could make up to $15 billion in reduced fuel costs, $25 billion in avoided environmental costs, and $32 billion from exporting the equipment and licensing for use in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bezdek|first=Roger H.|last2=Wendling|first2=Robert M.|date=2013-03-01|title=The return on investment of the clean coal technology program in the USA|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421512009615|journal=Energy Policy|series=Decades of Diesel|volume=54|pages=104–112|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2012.10.076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political support==
{{Expand section|cover more countries' viewpoints|date=February 2017}}

=== Australia ===
In Australia, carbon capture and storage was often referred to by then [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Kevin Rudd]] as a possible way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. (The previous [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]] had stated that [[nuclear power]] was a better alternative, as CCS technology may not prove to be economically feasible.)

=== Canada ===
In 2014 SaskPower a provincial-owned electric utility finished renovations on Boundary Dam’s boiler number 3 making it the worlds first post-combustion carbon capture storage facility.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://energyblog.nationalgeographic.com/2014/10/02/worlds-first-full-scale-clean-coal-plant-opens-in-canada/|title=World’s First Full-Scale ‘Clean’ Coal Plant Opens in Canada|last=Danko|first=Pete|date=2014-10-02|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renovation project ended up costing a little over $1.2 billion and can scrub out CO2 and other toxin from up to 90 percent of the flue gas that it emits.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Since 2006, China keeps releasing more {{CO2}} than [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions|any other country]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/business/china-davos-climate-change.html|title=China’s Emissions: More Than U.S. Plus Europe, and Still Rising|website=[[The New York Times]]|language=en|date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/chinese-coal-fuels-rise-in-global-carbon-emissions-2j0kvrd2z|title=Chinese coal fuels rise in global carbon emissions|website=[[The Times]]|language=en|date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2017/10/24/yes-the-u-s-leads-all-countries-in-reducing-carbon-emissions/#69229dfc3535|title=Yes, The U.S. Leads All Countries In Reducing Carbon Emissions|website=[[Forbes]]|language=en|date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jan/31/world-carbon-dioxide-emissions-country-data-co2|title=World carbon dioxide emissions data by country: China speeds ahead of the rest|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|date=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbl.nl/en/dossiers/Climatechange/Chinanowno1inCO2emissionsUSAinsecondposition|title=China now no. 1 in CO2 emissions; USA in second position|website=PBL [[Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]]|language=en|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers in China are focusing on increasing efficiency of burning coal so they can get more power out of less coal.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2101780-chinas-drive-to-clean-up-its-coal-power-one-plant-at-a-time/|title=China’s drive to clean up its coal power, one plant at a time|work=New Scientist|access-date=2017-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that new high efficiency power plants could reduce CO2 emission by 7% because they won't have to burn as much coal to get the same amount of power.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Japan ===
Following the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|catastrophic failure of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant]] in Japan that resulted from the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]], and the [[Japanese reaction to Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|subsequent widespread public opposition against nuclear power]], high energy, lower emission (HELE) coal power plants were increasingly favored by the [[Shinzō Abe]]-led government to recoup lost energy capacity from the partial shutdown of nuclear power plants in Japan and to replace aging coal and oil-fired power plants, while meeting 2030 emission targets of the [[Paris Agreement]]. 45 HELE power plants have been planned, purportedly to employ [[integrated gasification fuel cell cycle]], a further development of integrated gasification combined cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-31/japan-coal-power-plants/8224302|title=Japanese government planning to build 45 new coal fired power stations to diversify supply|last=McHugh|first=Babs|date=2017-02-23|access-date=2017-02-23|location=|newspaper=ABC Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-10/want-to-burn-coal-and-save-the-planet-japan-touts-a-solution|title=Want to Burn Coal and Save the Planet?

Japan had adopted prior pilot projects on IGCC coal power plants in the early-1990s and late-2000s.

=== United States ===
In the United States, "clean coal" was mentioned by former President [[George W. Bush]] on several occasions, including his 2007 [[State of the Union Address]]. Bush's position was that carbon capture and storage technologies should be encouraged as one means to reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil.

During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|US Presidential campaign for 2008]], both candidates [[John McCain]] and [[Barack Obama]] expressed interest in the development of CCS technologies as part of an overall comprehensive energy plan. The development of pollution mitigation technologies could also create export business for the United States or any other country working on it.

The [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|American Reinvestment and Recovery Act]], signed in 2009 by President Obama, allocated $3.4 billion for advanced carbon capture and storage technologies, including demonstration projects.

Former Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] has said that "we should strive to have new electricity generation come from other sources, such as clean coal and renewables,” and former Energy Secretary [[Steven Chu|Dr. Steven Chu]] has said that “It is absolutely worthwhile to invest in carbon capture and storage", noting that even if the U.S. and Europe turned their backs on coal, developing nations like India and China would likely not.

During the first [[United States presidential election debates, 2012|2012 United States presidential election debate]], [[Mitt Romney]] expressed his support for clean coal, and claimed that current federal policies were hampering the coal industry.&lt;ref name="npr2012-10-03"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/10/03/162258551/transcript-first-obama-romney-presidential-debate|title=Transcript And Audio: First Obama-Romney Debate|date=2012-10-03|publisher=[[Federal News Service]]|website=[[NPR]]|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the approach==
Environmentalists such as [[Dan Becker]], director of the [[Sierra Club]]'s Global Warming and Energy Program, believes that the term "clean coal" is misleading: "There is no such thing as clean coal and there never will be. It's an [[oxymoron]]." The Sierra Club's Coal Campaign has launched a site refuting the clean coal statements and advertising of the coal industry.

Complaints focus on the environmental impacts of [[coal mining|coal extraction]], high costs to [[carbon capture and storage|sequester carbon]], and uncertainty of how to manage end result [[air pollution|pollutants]] and [[radionuclide]]s. In reference to sequestration of carbon, concerns exist about whether geologic storage of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in reservoirs, aquifers, ''etc.'', is indefinite/permanent.

The palaeontologist and influential environmental activist [[Tim Flannery]] made the assertion that the concept of clean coal might not be viable for all geographical locations.

Critics also believe that the continuing construction of coal-powered plants (whether or not they use carbon sequestration techniques) encourages unsustainable mining practices for coal, which can strip away mountains, hillsides, and natural areas. They also point out that there can be a large amount of energy required and pollution emitted in transporting the coal to the power plants.

[[The Climate Reality Project|The Reality Coalition]], a US non-profit climate organization composed of the Alliance for Climate Protection, the [[Sierra Club]], the [[National Wildlife Federation]], the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] and the [[League of Conservation Voters]], ran a series of television commercials in 2008 and 2009. The commercials were highly critical of attempts to mitigate coal's pollution, stating that without capturing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and storing it safely that it cannot be called "clean coal".

[[Greenpeace]] is a major opponent of the concept, because they view emissions and wastes as not being avoided but instead transferred from one [[waste stream]] to another. According to [[Greenpeace USA]]'s Executive Director [[Phil Radford]] speaking in 2012, "even the industry figures it will take 10 or 20 years to arrive, and we need solutions sooner than that. We need to scale up renewable energy; “clean coal” is a distraction from that."

== Clean coal ==
The term Clean Coal in modern society often refers to the [[carbon capture and storage]] process. The term has been used by advertisers, lobbyists, and politicians such as  [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Conditt|first=Jessica|date=March 30, 2017|title=Dear Donald Trump: 'Clean coal' doesn't exist|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/30/clean-coal-myth-trump-carbon-capture-energy-no/|accessdate=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prior terminology===
The industry term "clean coal" is increasingly used in reference to carbon capture and storage, an advanced theoretical process that would eliminate or significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions from coal-based plants and permanently sequester them. More generally, the term has been found in modern usage to describe technologies designed to enhance both the efficiency and the environmental acceptability of coal extraction, preparation, and use.

U.S. Senate Bill 911 in April, 1987, defined clean coal technology as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The term clean coal technology means any technology...deployed at a new or existing facility which will achieve significant reductions in air emissions of sulfur dioxide or oxides of nitrogen associated with the utilization of coal in the generation of electricity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://behindtheplug.americaspower.org/2009/03/the-definition-of-clean-coal.html|title=The definition of clean coal «  Behind The Plug|publisher=|access-date=2012-08-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221052204/http://behindtheplug.americaspower.org/2009/03/the-definition-of-clean-coal.html|archive-date=2013-02-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before being adopted in this fashion, historically "clean coal" was used to refer to clean-burning coal with low levels of impurities, though this term faded after rates of domestic coal usage dropped. The term appeared in a speech to mine workers in 1918, in context indicating coal that was "free of dirt and impurities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://atomicinsights.com/2007/03/clean-coal-history-lesson.html |title="Clean coal" history lesson |access-date=2012-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831064249/http://atomicinsights.com/2007/03/clean-coal-history-lesson.html |archive-date=2012-08-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, prior to World War II, clean coal (also called "smokeless coal") generally referred to [[anthracite]] and high-grade [[bituminous coal]], used for cooking and home heating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wva-usa.com/history/mthope/smokeless.php "Smokeless Coal,"] WVa-USA.com, accessed May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Continuous emission monitoring systems''' ('''CEMS''') were historically used as a tool to monitor [[flue gas]] for [[oxygen]], [[carbon monoxide]] and [[carbon dioxide]] to provide information for [[combustion]] control in industrial settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=The [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] Company| authorlink= | coauthors= | title=Steam: its generation and use| date= | publisher=The Babcock &amp; Wilcox Company| location= | isbn=0-9634570-1-2 | pages=36–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are currently{{when|date=December 2011}} used as a means to comply with air [[emission standard]]s such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA) [[Acid Rain Program]],&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Code of Federal Regulations]], Title 40, Part 72, Subpart A&lt;/ref&gt; other federal emission programs, or state permitted emission standards. Facilities employ the use of CEMS to continuously collect, record and report the required emissions data.

The standard CEM system consists of a sample probe, [[Filter (chemistry)|filter]], sample line ([[umbilical cable|umbilical]]), gas conditioning system, [[calibration]] gas system, and a series of gas [[analyser|analyzer]]s which reflect the parameters being monitored.  Typical monitored emissions include:  [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrogen oxides]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[hydrogen chloride]], [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particulate matter]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[volatile organic compounds]], and [[oxygen]]. CEM systems can also measure air flow, flue gas [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] and [[moisture]].

In the U.S., the EPA requires a data acquisition and handling system to collect and report the data.  [[Sulfur dioxide|{{chem|S|O|2}}]] emissions must be measured in pounds per hour using both an {{chem|S|O|2}} pollutant concentration monitor and a volumetric flow monitor.  For [[NOx|NO&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;]], both a NO&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; pollutant concentration monitor and a diluent gas monitor are required to determine the emissions rate (lbs/mmBtu).  Opacity must also be monitored. NO&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; measuring is not a current requirement, however if monitored, a {{CO2}} or oxygen monitor plus a flow monitor should be used.  In monitoring these emissions, the system must be in continuous operation and must be able to sample, analyze, and record data at least every 15 minutes and then averaged hourly.&lt;ref name="epa.gov"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://epa.gov/airmarkets/emissions/continuous-factsheet.html | title=Continuous Emissions Monitoring Fact Sheet | publisher=US EPA | archivedate=February 11, 2009 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211082920/http://epa.gov/airmarkets/emissions/continuous-factsheet.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
A small sample of flue gas is extracted, by means of a [[pump]], into the CEM system via a sample probe. Facilities that [[combustion|combust]] [[fossil fuels]] often use a [[concentration|dilution]]-extractive probe to dilute the sample with clean, dry air to a [[ratio]] typically between 50:1 to 200:1, but usually 100:1. Dilution is used because pure flue gas can be hot, wet and, with some pollutants, sticky. Once diluted to the appropriate ratio, the sample is transported through a sample line (typically referred to as an umbilical) to a [[manifold]] from which individual analyzers may extract a sample. Gas analyzers employ various techniques to accurately measure concentrations. Some commonly used techniques include: [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]] [[adsorption]], [[chemiluminescence]], [[fluorescence]] and [[beta particle|beta ray]] [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]]. After [[analysis]], the gas exits the analyzer to a common manifold to all analyzers where it is vented out of doors. A Data Acquisition and Handling System (DAHS) receives the [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal output]] from each analyzer in order to [[data logging|collect and record emissions data]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.pnm.com/documents/396023/2708993/11B_Testimony+and+Exhibits+of+Chris+M.+Olson+pt2.pdf/dff3e6eb-25cc-4e03-bbc0-ae2acf7a3755|title = Tier 2 Generation Capital Projects|date = |access-date = 23 February 2016|website = |publisher = www.pnm.com|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another sample extraction method used in industrial sources and utility sources with low emission rates, is commonly referred to as the "hot dry" extractive method or "direct" CEMS. The sample is not diluted, but is carried along a heated sample line at high temperature into a sample conditioning unit. The sample is filtered to remove particulate matter and dried, usually with a [[chiller]], to remove [[moisture]]. Once conditioned, the sample enters a sampling [[manifold]] and is measured using the same methods above. One advantage of this method is the ability to measure % [[oxygen]] in the sample, which is often required in the regulatory calculations for emission corrections. Since dilution mixes clean dry air with the sample, dilution systems cannot measure % [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Quality assurance ==
Accuracy of the system is demonstrated in several ways. An internal [[quality assurance]] check is achieved by daily introduction of a [[certified]] [[concentration]] of gas to the sample probe.  The EPA also allows for the use of Continuous Emissions Monitoring Calibration Systems which dilute gases to generate calibration standards.&lt;ref&gt;"EPA Traceability Protocol for Assay and Certification of Gaseous Calibration Standards, "EPA-600/R93/224. Revised September 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The analyzer reading must be [[accurate]] to a certain percentage. The percent accuracy can vary, but most fall between 2.5% and 5%. In power stations affected by the Acid Rain Program, annual (or bi-annual) certification of the system must be performed by an independent firm. The firm will have an independent CEM system temporarily in place to collect emissions data in parallel with the plant CEMS. This testing is referred to as a Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA).

In the U.S., periodic evaluations of the equipment must be reported and recorded.&lt;ref name="epa.gov"/&gt; This includes daily calibration error tests, daily interference tests for flow monitors, and semi-annual (or annual) RATA and bias tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www3.epa.gov/ttnemc01/perfspec/ps-8a.pdf|title = Specifications and Test Procedures for Total Hydrocarbon Continuous Monitoring Systems in Stationary Sources|date = |access-date = 23 February 2016|website = |publisher = www3.epa.gov|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; CEMS equipment is expensive and not always affordable for a facility. In such cases, a facility will install non-EPA compliant analysis equipment at the emissions point. Once yearly, for the equipment evaluation, a mobile CEMS company measures emissions with compliant equipment. The results are then compared to the non-compliant analyzer system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Flue Gas &amp; Emissions Analyzers {{!}} Nova Gas|url = http://www.nova-gas.com/analyzers/flue-emissions|website = Nova Gas|access-date = 2016-02-23|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="107334">The '''deductive-nomological model''' ('''DN model'''), also known as '''[[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]]'s model''', the '''Hempel–[[Paul Oppenheim|Oppenheim]] model''', the '''[[Karl Popper|Popper]]–Hempel model''', or the '''covering law model''', is a formal view of scientifically answering questions asking, "Why...?".  The DN model poses scientific explanation as a [[deductive inference|deductive]] structure—that is, one where truth of its premises entails truth of its conclusion—hinged on accurate prediction or [[postdiction]] of the phenomenon to be explained.

Because of problems concerning humans' ability to define, discover, and know [[causality]], it was omitted in initial formulations of the DN model. Causality was thought to be incidentally approximated by realistic selection of premises that ''derive'' the phenomenon of interest from observed starting conditions plus general [[scientific law|law]]s.  Still, DN model formally permitted causally irrelevant factors.  Also, derivability from observations and laws sometimes yielded absurd answers.

When [[logical empiricism]] fell out of favor in the 1960s, the DN model was widely seen as a flawed or greatly incomplete model of scientific explanation. Nonetheless, it  remained an idealized version of scientific explanation, and one that was rather accurate when applied to [[modern physics]].  In the early 1980s, revision to DN model emphasized ''maximal specificity'' for relevance of the conditions and [[axiom]]s stated.  Together with Hempel's [[inductive-statistical model]], the DN model forms scientific explanation's '''covering law model''', which is also termed, from critical angle, '''subsumption theory'''.

== Form ==

The term ''[[deductive inference|deductive]]'' distinguishes the DN model's intended [[determinism]] from the [[probabilism]] of [[inductive inference]]s.&lt;ref name=Woodward-DNmodel/&gt;  The term ''nomological'' is derived from the Greek word ''[[:wikt:νόμος|νόμος]]'' or ''nomos'', meaning "law".&lt;ref name=Woodward-DNmodel&gt;Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"], §2 "The DN model", in ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|SEP]]'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The DN model holds to a view of scientific explanation whose ''conditions of adequacy'' (CA)—semiformal but stated classically—are ''derivability'' (CA1), ''lawlikeness'' (CA2), ''empirical content'' (CA3), and ''truth'' (CA4).&lt;ref name=Fetzer-p113&gt;James Fetzer, ch 3 "The paradoxes of Hempelian explanation", in Fetzer, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA113 p 113].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the DN model, a law [[axiom]]atizes an [[enumerative induction|unrestricted generalization]] from antecedent ''A'' to consequent ''B'' by [[conditional sentence|conditional proposition]]—''If A, then B''—and has empirical content testable.&lt;ref&gt;Montuschi, ''Objects in Social Science'' (Continuum, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bQ24-BV8WSAC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq= pp 61–62].&lt;/ref&gt;  A law differs from mere true regularity—for instance, ''George always carries only $1 bills in his wallet''—by supporting [[counterfactual]] claims and thus suggesting what ''must'' be true,&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 2], subch "DN model of explanation and [[hypothetico-deductive model|HD model]] of theory development", pp 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; while following from a scientific theory's axiomatic structure.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-axiomatic&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 2], subch "Axiomatic account of theories", pp 27–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon to be explained is the '''''explanandum'''''—an event, [[scientific law|law]], or [[scientific theory|theory]]—whereas the [[premise]]s to explain it are '''''explanans''''', true or highly confirmed, containing at least one universal law, and entailing the explanandum.&lt;ref name=Suppe&gt;Suppe, "Afterword—1977", "Introduction", §1 "Swan song for positivism", §1A "Explanation and intertheoretical reduction", [https://books.google.com/books?id=SpvZsxCA0TIC&amp;pg=PA619 pp 619–24], in Suppe, ed, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SpvZsxCA0TIC ''Structure of Scientific Theories'', 2nd edn] (U Illinois P, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt;  Thus, given the explanans as initial, specific conditions ''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; . . . C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' plus general laws ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; . . . L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', the phenomenon ''E'' as explanandum is a deductive consequence, thereby scientifically explained.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;

[[Aristotle]]'s scientific explanation in ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' resembles the DN model, an idealized form of scientific explanation.&lt;ref name=Shaffner&gt;Kenneth F Schaffner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hQ-z5oriurYC&amp;pg=PA79 "Explanation and causation in biomedical sciences"], pp 79–125, in Laudan, ed, ''Mind and Medicine'' (U California P, 1983), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hQ-z5oriurYC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq= p 81].&lt;/ref&gt;  The framework of [[Aristotelian physics]]—[[Aristotelian metaphysics]]—reflected the perspective of this principally biologist, who, amid living entities' undeniable purposiveness, formalized [[vitalism]] and [[teleology]], an intrinsic [[ethics|morality]] in nature.&lt;ref name=Montalenti&gt;G Montalenti, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMAf65cDmAQC&amp;pg=PA3 ch 2 "From Aristotle to Democritus via Darwin"], in Ayala &amp; Dobzhansky, eds, ''Studies in the Philosophy of Biology'' (U California P, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  With emergence of [[Copernicanism]], however, [[René Descartes|Descartes]] introduced [[mechanical philosophy]], then [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] rigorously posed lawlike explanation, both Descartes and especially Newton shunning teleology within [[natural philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;In the 17th century, Descartes as well as [[Isaac Newton]] firmly believed in God as nature's designer and thereby firmly believed in natural purposiveness, yet found [[teleology]] to be [[problem of demarcation|outside]] [[natural philosophy|science]]'s inquiry (Bolotin, ''Approach to Aristotle's Physics'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=LLqB1IfeSZ0C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq= pp 31–33]).  By 1650, formalizing [[heliocentrism]] and launching [[mechanical philosophy]], [[Cartesian physics]] overthrew geocentrism as well as Aristotelian physics.  In the 1660s, [[Robert Boyle]] sought to lift chemistry as a new discipline from alchemy.  Newton more especially sought the laws of nature—simply the regularities of phenomena—whereby [[Newtonian physics]], reducing celestial science to terrestrial science, ejected from physics the vestige of Aristotelian metaphysics, thus disconnecting physics and alchemy/chemistry, which then followed its own course, yielding chemistry around 1800.&lt;/ref&gt;  At 1740, [[David Hume]]&lt;ref&gt;Nicknames for principles attributed to Hume—[[Hume's fork]], [[problem of induction]], [[Hume's law]]—were not created by Hume but by later philosophers labeling them for ease of reference.&lt;/ref&gt; staked [[Hume's fork]],&lt;ref&gt;By Hume's fork, the truths of mathematics and logic as [[formal sciences]] are universal through "relations of ideas"—simply abstract truths—thus knowable [[a priori knowledge|without experience]].  On the other hand, the claimed truths of [[empirical science]]s are [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] on "fact and real existence", knowable only [[a posteriori|upon experience]].  By Hume's fork, the two categories never cross.  Any treatises containing neither can contain only "sophistry and illusion".  (Flew, ''Dictionary'', "Hume's fork", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq= p 156]).&lt;/ref&gt; highlighted the [[problem of induction]],&lt;ref&gt;Not privy to the world's either necessities or impossibilities, but by force of habit or mental nature, humans experience sequence of sensory events, find seeming [[constant conjunction]], make the unrestricted generalization of an [[enumerative induction]], and justify it by presuming [[uniformitarianism|uniformity of nature]].  Humans thus attempt to justify a minor induction by adding a major induction, both logically invalid and unverified by experience—the [[problem of induction]]—how humans irrationally presume discovery of causality.  (Chakraborti, ''Logic'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y2u8C_ur8VIC&amp;pg=PA381&amp;dq=uniformity+of+nature+problem+of+induction p 381]; Flew, ''Dictionary'', "Hume", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq= p 156].&lt;/ref&gt; and found humans ignorant of either necessary or sufficient causality.&lt;ref&gt;For more discursive discussions of types of causality—necessary, sufficient, necessary and sufficient, component, sufficient component, [[counterfactual]]—see Rothman &amp; Greenland, Parascandola &amp; Weed, as well as Kundi.  Following is more direct elucidation:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A ''necessary cause'' is a causal condition ''required'' for an event to occur.  A ''sufficient cause'' is a causal condition ''complete'' to produce an event.  Necessary is not always sufficient, however, since other casual factors—that is, other ''component causes''—might be required to produce the event.  Conversely, a sufficient cause is not always a necessary cause, since differing sufficient causes might likewise produce the event.  Strictly speaking, a sufficient cause cannot be a single factor, as any causal factor must act casually through many other factors.  And although a necessary cause might exist, humans cannot verify one, since humans cannot check every possible state of affairs.  (Language can state necessary causality as a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]—a statement whose terms' [[syntax|arrangement]] and [[semantics|meanings]] render it is logically true by mere definition—which, as an [[analytic-synthetic distinction|''analytic'' statement]], is uninformative about the actual world.  A statement referring to and contingent on the world's actualities is a [[analytic-synthetic distinction|''synthetic'' statement]], rather.)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sufficient causality is more actually ''sufficient component causality''—a complete set of component causes interacting within a causal constellation—which, however, is beyond humans' capacity to fully discover.  Yet humans tend intuitively to conceive of causality as ''necessary and sufficient''—a single factor both required and complete—the one and only cause, ''the'' cause.  One may so view flipping a light switch.  The switch's flip was not sufficient cause, however, but contingent on countless factors—intact bulb, intact wiring, circuit box, bill payment, utility company, neighborhood infrastructure, engineering of technology by [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Nikola Tesla]], explanation of electricity by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], harnessing of electricity by [[Benjamin Franklin]], metal refining, metal mining, and on and on—while, whatever the tally of events, nature's causal mechanical structure remains a mystery.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
From a [[David Hume|Humean]] perspective, the light's putative inability to come on without the switch's flip is neither a logical necessity nor an empirical finding, since no experience ever reveals that the world either is or will remain universally uniform as to the aspects appearing to bind the switch's flip as the necessary event for the light's coming on.  If the light comes on without switch flip, surprise will affect one's ''mind'', but one's mind cannot know that the event violated ''nature''.  As just a mundane possibility, an activity within the wall could have connected the wires and completed the circuit without the switch's flip.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Though apparently enjoying the scandals that trailed his own explanations, Hume was very practical and his skepticism was quite uneven (Flew [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=induction+scandal+sceptical+common+sense+logical+natural p 156]).  Although Hume rejected orthodox theism and sought to reject [[metaphysics]], Hume supposedly extended Newtonian method to the human mind, which Hume, in a sort of antiCopernican move, placed as the pivot of human knowledge (Flew [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=anti-Copernican p 154]).  Hume thus placed his own [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]] on par with [[Newton's theory|Newton's theory of motion]] (Buckle [https://books.google.com/books?id=jiq14nexzu0C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=Hume's+Newton+crowning#v=twopage pp 70–71], Redman [https://books.google.com/books?id=1faeMedY8k8C&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=theism+moral+causal+induction#v=twopage pp 182–83], Schliesser [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/hume-newton § abstract]).  Hume found [[enumerative induction]] an unavoidable custom required for one to live (Gattei [https://books.google.com/books?id=oPPu1JvMBFoC&amp;pg=PA28#v=twopage pp 28–29]).  Hume found [[constant conjunction]] to reveal a modest causality type: ''[[counterfactual]] causality''.  Silent as to causal role—whether necessity, sufficiency, component strength, or mechanism—counterfactual causality is simply that alteration of a factor prevents or produces the event of interest.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;  Hume also highlighted the [[Hume's law|fact/value gap]], as what ''is'' does not itself reveal what ''ought''.&lt;ref&gt;Hume noted that authors ubiquitously continue for some time stating facts and then suddenly switch to stating [[normative|norms]]—supposedly what should be—with barely explanation.  Yet such values, as in [[ethics]] or [[aesthetics]] or [[political philosophy]], are not found true merely by stating facts: ''is'' does not itself reveal ''ought''.  Hume's law is the principle that the fact/value gap is unbridgeable—that no statements of facts can ever justify norms—although Hume himself did not state that.  Rather, some later philosophers found Hume to merely stop short of stating it, but to have communicated it.  Anyway, Hume found that humans acquired morality through experience by [[communal reinforcement]].  (Flew, ''Dictionary'', "Hume's law", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=Hume's+law p 157] &amp; "Naturalistic fallacy", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq=naturalistic+fallacy#v=twopage pp 240–41]; Wootton, ''Modern Political Thought'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=78eaIfCg2mcC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=Hume+communal+reinforcement p 306].)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Critique of Pure Reason|Near 1780]], countering Hume's ostensibly radical [[empiricism]], [[Immanuel Kant]] highlighted extreme [[rationalism]]—as by [[Descartes]] or [[Spinoza]]—and sought middle ground.  Inferring the mind to arrange experience of the world into ''substance'', ''space'', and ''time'', Kant placed the mind as part of the causal constellation of experience and thereby found [[Newton's theory|Newton's theory of motion]] universally true,&lt;ref&gt;
Kant inferred that the [[category (Kant)|mind's constants]] arrange space holding [[Euclidean geometry]]—like Newton's [[absolute space]]—while objects interact temporally as modeled in [[Newton's theory|Newton's theory of motion]], whose [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]] is a truth ''[[synthetic a priori]]'', that is, contingent on experience, indeed, but known universally true without universal experience.  Thus, the [[category (Kant)|mind's innate constants]] [[synthetic a priori|cross the tongs]] of [[Hume's fork]] and lay Newton's [[universal gravitation]] as ''[[a priori knowledge|a priori]]'' truth.&lt;/ref&gt; yet knowledge of [[ding-an-sich|things in themselves]] impossible.&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;  Safeguarding [[natural philosophy|science]], then, Kant paradoxically stripped it of [[scientific realism]].&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chakravartty/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bolotin-realism/&gt;  Aborting [[Francis Bacon]]'s [[inductivist]] mission to dissolve the veil of appearance to uncover the ''[[noumena]]''—[[metaphysics|metaphysical]] view of nature's [[essentialism|ultimate truths]]—Kant's [[transcendental idealism]] tasked science with simply modeling patterns of ''[[phenomena]]''.  Safeguarding metaphysics, too, it found the [[category (Kant)|mind's constant]]s holding also [[categorical imperative|universal moral truths]],&lt;ref&gt;Whereas a [[hypothetical imperative]] is practical, simply what one ought to do if one seeks a particular outcome, the [[categorical imperative]] is morally universal, what everyone always ought to do.&lt;/ref&gt; and launched [[German idealism]], increasingly speculative.

[[Auguste Comte]] found the [[problem of induction]] rather irrelevant since [[enumerative induction]] is grounded on the empiricism available, while science's point is not metaphysical truth.  Comte found human knowledge had evolved from theological to metaphysical to scientific—the ultimate stage—rejecting both theology and metaphysics as asking questions unanswerable and posing answers unverifiable.  Comte in the 1830s expounded [[positivism]]—the first modern [[philosophy of science]] and simultaneously a [[political philosophy]]&lt;ref name=Bourdeau&gt;Bourdeau, "Auguste Comte", §§ "Abstract" &amp; [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/#Int "Introduction"], in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;—rejecting conjectures about [[unobservable]]s, thus rejecting search for ''causes''.&lt;ref&gt;Comte, ''A General View of Positivism'' (Trübner, 1865), [https://books.google.com/books?id=59hUAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=atheism+repudiated+causes+laws pp 49–50], including the following passage: "As long as men persist in attempting to answer the insoluble questions which occupied the attention of the childhood of our race, by far the more rational plan is to do as was done then, that is, simply to give free play to the imagination.  These spontaneous beliefs have gradually fallen into disuse, not because they have been disproved, but because humankind has become more enlightened as to its wants and the scope of its powers, and has gradually given an entirely new direction to its speculative efforts".&lt;/ref&gt;  Positivism predicts observations, confirms the predictions, and states a ''law'', thereupon [[applied science|applied]] to benefit human society.&lt;ref&gt;Flew, ''Dictionary'' (St Martin's, 1984), "Positivism", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=positivism+prediction p 283].&lt;/ref&gt;  From late 19th century into the early 20th century, the influence of positivism spanned the globe.&lt;ref name=Bourdeau/&gt;  Meanwhile, evolutionary theory's [[natural selection]] brought the [[Copernican Revolution]] into biology and eventuated in the first conceptual alternative to [[vitalism]] and [[teleology]].&lt;ref name=Montalenti/&gt;

==Growth==

Whereas Comtean positivism posed science as ''description'', [[logical positivism]] emerged in the late 1920s and posed science as ''explanation'', perhaps to better [[unity of science|unify empirical sciences]] by covering not only [[fundamental science]]—that is, [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]]—but [[special science]]s, too, such as biology, psychology, economics, and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background&gt;Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"], §1 "Background and introduction", in ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|SEP]]'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  After defeat of [[National Socialism]] with World War II's close in 1945, logical positivism shifted to a milder variant, ''logical empiricism''.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii&gt;Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR12 p xii].&lt;/ref&gt;  All variants of the movement, which lasted until 1965, are neopositivism,&lt;ref&gt;Any ''positivism'' placed in the 20th century is generally ''neo'', although there was [[Ernst Mach]]'s positivism nearing 1900, and a general positivistic approach to science—traceable to the [[inductivist]] trend from [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] at 1620, the [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] [[research program]] at 1687, and [[Auguste Comte|Comptean]] positivism at 1830—that continues in a vague but usually disavowed sense within popular culture and some sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; sharing the quest of [[verificationism]].&lt;ref&gt;Neopositivists are sometimes called "verificationists".&lt;/ref&gt;

Neopositivists led emergence of the philosophy subdiscipline [[philosophy of science]], researching such questions and aspects of scientific theory and knowledge.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;  [[Scientific realism]] takes scientific theory's statements at [[face value]], thus accorded either falsity or truth—probable or approximate or actual.&lt;ref name=Chakravartty&gt;Chakravartty, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/scientific-realism "Scientific realism"], §1.2 "The three dimensions of realist commitment", in ''SEP'', 2013: "Semantically, realism is committed to a literal interpretation of scientific claims about the world.  In common parlance, realists take theoretical statements at 'face value'.  According to realism, claims about scientific entities, processes, properties, and relations, whether they be observable or unobservable, should be construed literally as having truth values, whether true or false.  This semantic commitment contrasts primarily with those of so-called instrumentalist epistemologies of science, which interpret descriptions of unobservables simply as instruments for the prediction of observable phenomena, or for systematizing observation reports.  Traditionally, instrumentalism holds that claims about unobservable things have no literal meaning at all (though the term is often used more liberally in connection with some antirealist positions today).  Some antirealists contend that claims involving unobservables should not be interpreted literally, but as elliptical for corresponding claims about observables".&lt;/ref&gt;  Neopositivists held scientific antirealism as [[instrumentalism]], holding scientific theory as simply a device to predict observations and their course, while statements on nature's unobservable aspects are elliptical at or metaphorical of its observable aspects, rather.&lt;ref name=Chakravartty-Okasha&gt;
*Chakravartty, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/scientific-realism "Scientific realism"], §4 "Antirealism: Foils for scientific realism", §4.1 "Empiricism", in ''SEP'', 2013: "Traditionally, [[instrumentalism|instrumentalist]]s maintain that terms for unobservables, by themselves, have no meaning; construed literally, statements involving them are not even candidates for truth or falsity.  The most influential advocates of [[instrumentalism]] were the [[logical empiricist]]s (or logical positivists), including [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]] and [[Carl Hempel|Hempel]], famously associated with the [[Vienna Circle]] group of philosophers and scientists as well as important contributors elsewhere.  In order to rationalize the ubiquitous use of terms which might otherwise be taken to refer to unobservables in scientific discourse, they adopted a non-literal [[semantics]] according to which these terms acquire meaning by being associated with terms for observables (for example, '[[electron]]' might mean 'white streak in a [[cloud chamber]]'), or with demonstrable laboratory procedures (a view called '[[operationalism]]').  Insuperable difficulties with this semantics led ultimately (in large measure) to the demise of [[logical empiricism]] and the growth of [[scientific realism|realism]].  The contrast here is not merely in [[semantics]] and [[epistemology]]: a number of logical empiricists also held the [[neo-Kantian]] view that [[ontological]] questions 'external' to the frameworks for knowledge represented by theories are also meaningless (the choice of a framework is made solely on [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] grounds), thereby rejecting the [[metaphysical]] dimension of [[scientific realism|realism]] (as in Carnap 1950)".
*Okasha, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Oxford U P, 2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=W2jCrzKYqxMC&amp;pg=PA62 p 62]: "Strictly we should distinguish two sorts of anti-realism.  According to the first sort, talk of unobservable entities is not to be understood literally at all.  So when a scientist pus forward a theory about electrons, for example, we should not take him to be asserting the existence of entities called 'electrons'.  Rather, his talk of electrons is metaphorical.  This form of anti-realism was popular in the first half of the 20th century, but few people advocate it today.  It was motivated largely by a doctrine in the philosophy of language, according to which it is not possible to make meaningful assertions about things that cannot in principle be observed, a doctrine that few contemporary philosophers accept.  The second sort of anti-realism accepts that talk of unobservable entities should be taken at face value: if a theory says that electrons are negatively charged, it is true if electrons do exist and are negatively charged, but false otherwise.  But we will never know which, says the anti-realist.  So the correct attitude towards the claims that scientists make about unobservable reality is one of total agnosticism.  They are either true or false, but we are incapable of finding out which.  Most modern anti-realism is of this second sort".&lt;/ref&gt;

DN model received its most detailed, influential statement by [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl G Hempel]], first in his 1942 article "The function of general laws in history", and more explicitly with [[Paul Oppenheim]] in their 1948 article "Studies in the logic of explanation".&lt;ref name=Woodward-introduction/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl G Hempel &amp; Paul Oppenheim, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/185169 "Studies in the logic of explanation"], ''Philosophy of Science'', 1948 Apr; '''15'''(2):135–175.&lt;/ref&gt;  Leading logical empiricist, Hempel embraced the [[David Hume|Humean]] empiricist view that humans observe sequence of sensory events, not cause and effect,&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background/&gt; as causal relations and casual mechanisms are unobservables.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism/&gt;  DN model bypasses causality beyond mere [[constant conjunction]]: first an event like ''A'', then always an event like ''B''.&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background/&gt;

Hempel held [[natural laws]]—empirically confirmed regularities—as satisfactory, and if included realistically to approximate causality.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  In later articles, Hempel defended DN model and proposed probabilistic explanation by ''[[inductive-statistical model]]'' (IS model).&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  DN model and IS model—whereby the probability must be high, such as at least 50%&lt;ref name=Woodward-ISmodel/&gt;—together form ''covering law model'',&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt; as named by a critic, [[William Dray]].&lt;ref&gt;von Wright, ''Explanation and Understanding'' (Cornell U P, 1971), [https://books.google.com/books?id=33wCi2bg5x0C&amp;pg=PA11 p 11].&lt;/ref&gt;  Derivation of statistical laws from other statistical laws goes to the ''[[deductive-statistical model]]'' (DS model).&lt;ref name=Woodward-ISmodel&gt;Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"], §2 "The DN model", §2.3 "Inductive statistical explanation", in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Glennan&gt;Stuart Glennan, "Explanation", § "Covering-law model of explanation", in Sarkar &amp; Pfeifer, eds, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Routledge, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq= p 276].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Georg Henrik von Wright]], another critic, named the totality ''subsumption theory''.&lt;ref name=Riedel&gt;Manfred Riedel, "Causal and historical explanation", in Manninen &amp; Tuomela, eds, ''Essays on Explanation and Understanding'' (D Reidel, 1976), [https://books.google.com/books?id=It3ji_AuO3sC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Covering+subsumption pp 3–4].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==

Amid failure of [[neopositivism]]'s fundamental tenets,&lt;ref&gt;
Neopositivism's fundamental tenets were the verifiability criterion of ''cognitive meaningfulness'', the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic/synthetic gap]], and the observation/theory gap.  From 1950 to 1951, Carl Gustav Hempel renounced the verifiability criterion.  In 1951 [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] attacked the analytic/synthetic gap.  In 1958, [[Norwood Russell Hanson]] blurred the observational/theoretical gap.  In 1959, [[Karl Raimund Popper]] attacked all of verificationism—he attacked, actually, any type of positivism—by asserting falsificationism.  In 1962, [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]] overthrew [[foundationalism]], which was erroneously presumed to be a fundamental tenet of neopositivism.
&lt;/ref&gt; Hempel in 1965 abandoned verificationism, signaling neopositivism's demise.&lt;ref name=Fetzer-reFall&gt;
Fetzer, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/hempel "Carl Hempel"], §3 "Scientific reasoning", in ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|SEP]]'', 2013: "The need to dismantle the verifiability criterion of meaningfulness together with the demise of the observational/theoretical distinction meant that logical positivism no longer represented a rationally defensible position.  At least two of its defining tenets had been shown to be without merit.  Since most philosophers believed that Quine had shown the analytic/synthetic distinction was also untenable, moreover, many concluded that the enterprise had been a total failure.  Among the important benefits of Hempel's critique, however, was the production of more general and flexible criteria of ''cognitive significance'' in Hempel (1965b), included in a famous collection of his studies, ''Aspects of Scientific Explanation'' (1965d).  There he proposed that ''cognitive significance'' could not be adequately captured by means of principles of verification or falsification, whose defects were parallel, but instead required a far more subtle and nuanced approach.

Hempel suggested multiple criteria for assessing the ''cognitive significance'' of different theoretical systems, where significance is not categorical but rather a matter of degree: 'Significant systems range from those whose entire extralogical vocabulary consists of observation terms, through theories whose formulation relies heavily on theoretical constructs, on to systems with hardly any bearing on potential empirical findings' (Hempel 1965b: 117).  The criteria Hempel offered for evaluating the 'degrees of significance' of theoretical systems (as conjunctions of hypotheses, definitions, and auxiliary claims) were (a) the clarity and precision with which they are formulated, including explicit connections to observational language; (b) the systematic—explanatory and predictive—power of such a system, in relation to observable phenomena; (c) the formal simplicity of the systems with which a certain degree of systematic power is attained; and (d) the extent to which those systems have been confirmed by experimental evidence (Hempel 1965b).  The elegance of Hempel's study laid to rest any lingering aspirations for simple criteria of 'cognitive significance' and signaled the demise of logical positivism as a philosophical movement".
&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1930 onward, Karl Popper had refuted any positivism by asserting [[falsificationism]], which Popper claimed had killed positivism, although, paradoxically, Popper was commonly mistaken for a positivist.&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;Popper, "Against big words", ''In Search of a Better World'' (Routledge, 1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=L33XSZE77OkC&amp;pg=PA89#v=twopage pp 89-90].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hachoben&gt;Hacohen, ''Karl Popper: The Formative Years'' (Cambridge U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3VtHcYGp2pIC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=Habermas+broad+Popper+killed+logical+positivism#v=twopage pp 212–13].&lt;/ref&gt;  Even Popper's 1934 book&lt;ref&gt;''[[Logik der Forschung]]'', published in Austria in 1934, was translated by Popper from German to English, ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'', and arrived in the [[English-speaking world]] in 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; embraces DN model,&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Woodward-introduction&gt;Woodward, "Scientific explanation", in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2011, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation abstract].&lt;/ref&gt; widely accepted as the model of scientific explanation for as long as physics remained the model of science examined by philosophers of science.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism/&gt;&lt;ref name=cplaws/&gt;

In the 1940s, filling the vast observational gap between cytology&lt;ref&gt;As scientific study of cells, cytology emerged in the 19th century, yet its technology and methods were insufficient to clearly visualize and establish existence of any cell [[organelle]]s beyond the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[biochemistry]],&lt;ref&gt;The first famed biochemistry experiment was [[Edward Buchner]]'s in 1897 (Morange, ''A History'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe93vz5ZLVsC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq= p 11]).  The biochemistry discipline soon emerged, initially investigating [[colloid]]s in biological systems, a "biocolloidology" (Morange [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe93vz5ZLVsC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq= p 12]; Bechtel, ''Discovering'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=WrEquK3hoDwC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=biocolloidology+colloids+exemplifies+organic+proteins p 94]).  This yielded to macromolecular theory, the term ''macromolecule'' introduced by German chemist [[Hermann Staudinger]] in 1922 (Morange [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe93vz5ZLVsC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq= p 12]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[cell biology]] arose&lt;ref&gt;Cell biology emerged principally at [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]] through new technology ([[electron microscope]] and [[ultracentrifuge]]) and new techniques ([[cell fractionation]] and advancements in staining and fixation).&lt;/ref&gt; and established existence of cell [[organelle]]s besides the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].  Launched in the late 1930s, the [[molecular biology]] [[research program]] cracked a [[genetic code]] in the early 1960s and then converged with cell biology as ''cell and molecular biology'', its breakthroughs and discoveries defying DN model by arriving in quest not of lawlike explanation but of causal mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism&gt;Bechtel, ''Discovering Cell Mechanisms'' (Cambridge U P, 2006), esp [https://books.google.com/books?id=WrEquK3hoDwC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=empiricists+Salmon#v=twopage pp 24–25].&lt;/ref&gt;  Biology became a new model of science, while [[special sciences]] were no longer thought defective by lacking universal laws, as borne by physics.&lt;ref name=cplaws/&gt;

In 1948, when explicating DN model and stating scientific explanation's semiformal ''conditions of adequacy'', [[Carl Hempel|Hempel]] and [[Paul Oppenheim|Oppenheim]] acknowledged redundancy of the third, ''[[empiricism|empirical content]]'', implied by the other three—''derivability'', ''lawlikeness'', and ''truth''.&lt;ref name=Fetzer-p113/&gt;  In the early 1980s, upon widespread view that causality ensures the explanans' relevance, [[Wesley Salmon]] called for returning ''cause'' to ''because'',&lt;ref&gt;James Fetzer, ch 3 "The paradoxes of Hempelian explanation", in Fetzer J, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=causality pp 121–122].&lt;/ref&gt; and along with [[James H. Fetzer|James Fetzer]] helped replace CA3 ''empirical content'' with CA3' ''strict maximal specificity''.&lt;ref&gt;Fetzer, ch 3 in Fetzer, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=better p 129].&lt;/ref&gt;

Salmon introduced ''causal mechanical'' explanation, never clarifying how it proceeds, yet reviving philosophers' interest in such.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism/&gt;  Via shortcomings of Hempel's inductive-statistical model (IS model), Salmon introduced ''[[statistical-relevance model]]'' (SR model).&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt;  Although DN model remained an idealized form of scientific explanation, especially in [[applied science]]s,&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt; most philosophers of science consider DN model flawed by excluding many types of explanations generally accepted as scientific.&lt;ref name=Glennan/&gt;

==Strengths==

As theory of knowledge, [[epistemology]] differs from [[ontology]], which is a subbranch of [[metaphysics]], theory of reality.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-metaphysics-epistemology/&gt;  Ontology poses which categories of being—what sorts of things exist—and so, although a scientific theory's ontological commitment can be modified in light of experience, an ontological commitment inevitably precedes empirical inquiry.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-metaphysics-epistemology&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 1], subch "Areas of philosophy that bear on philosophy of science", § "Metaphysics", pp 8–9, § "Epistemology", p 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Natural law]]s, so called, are statements of humans' observations, thus are epistemological—concerning human knowledge—the ''[[epistemic]]''.  Causal mechanisms and structures existing putatively independently of minds exist, or would exist, in the natural world's structure itself, and thus are ontological, the ''[[ontic]]''. Blurring epistemic with ontic—as by incautiously presuming a natural law to refer to a causal mechanism, or to trace structures realistically during unobserved transitions, or to be true regularities always unvarying—tends to generate a ''[[category mistake]]''.&lt;ref&gt;H Atmanspacher, R C Bishop &amp; A Amann, "Extrinsic and intrinsic irreversibility in probabilistic dynamical laws", in Khrennikov, ed, ''Proceedings'' (World Scientific, 2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=9B6b5WKuNWwC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=ontic+epistemic+general pp 51–52].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fetzer, ch 3, in Fetzer, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA118 p 118], poses some possible ways that natural laws, so called, when [[epistemic]] can fail as [[ontic]]: "The underlying conception is that of bringing order to our ''knowledge'' of the universe.  Yet there are at least three reasons why even complete knowledge of every empirical regularity that obtains during the world's history might not afford an adequate inferential foundation for discovery of the world's laws.  First, some laws might remain uninstantiated and therefore not be displayed by any regularity.  Second, some regularities may be accidental and therefore not display any law of nature.  And, third, in the case of probabilistic laws, some frequencies might deviate from their generating nomic probabilities 'by chance' and therefore display natural laws in ways that are unrepresentative or biased".&lt;/ref&gt;

Discarding ontic commitments, including causality ''per se'', DN model permits a theory's laws to be reduced to—that is, subsumed by—a more fundamental theory's laws.  The higher theory's laws are explained in DN model by the lower theory's laws.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-axiomatic/&gt;&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  Thus, the epistemic success of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]ian theory's [[law of universal gravitation]] is reduced to—thus explained by—[[Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]], although Einstein's discards Newton's ontic claim that universal gravitation's epistemic success predicting [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]]&lt;ref&gt;This theory reduction occurs if, and apparently only if, the Sun and one planet are modeled as a two-body system, excluding all other planets (Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P60&amp;dq= pp 60–62]).&lt;/ref&gt; is through a causal mechanism of a straightly attractive force instantly traversing [[absolute space]] despite [[absolute time]].

Covering law model reflects [[neopositivism]]'s vision of [[empirical science]], a vision interpreting or presuming [[unity of science]], whereby all empirical sciences are either [[fundamental science]]—that is, [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]]—or are [[special sciences]], whether [[astrophysics]], chemistry, biology, [[geology]], psychology, economics, and so on.&lt;ref name=cplaws&gt;Reutlinger, Schurz &amp; Hüttemann, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2011/entries/ceteris-paribus "Ceteris paribus"], § 1.1 "Systematic introduction", in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spohn, ''Laws of Belief'' (Oxford U P, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MSXrFBvIZIUC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=fundamental+special+sciences p 305].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whereas fundamental physics has sought [[scientific law|law]]s of [[determinism|universal regularity]], special sciences normally include ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' laws, which are predictively accurate to high [[probability]] in "normal conditions" or with "all else equal", but have exceptions [Reutlinger ''et al'' § 1.1].  Chemistry's laws seem [[deterministic|exceptionless]] in their domains, yet were in principle reduced to fundamental physics [Feynman [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=chemistry p 5], Schwarz [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9501161 Fig 1], and so are special sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;  All special sciences would network via covering law model.&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), ch 5, subch "Introduction: Relating disciplines by relating theories" pp 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;  And by stating ''boundary conditions'' while supplying ''bridge laws'', any special law would reduce to a lower special law, ultimately reducing—theoretically although generally not practically—to fundamental science.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-TheoryReduction&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), ch 5, subch "Theory reduction model and the [[unity of science]] program" pp 72–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bem-Long/&gt;  (''Boundary conditions'' are specified conditions whereby the phenomena of interest occur.

==Weaknesses==

By DN model, if one asks, "Why is that shadow 20 feet long?", another can answer, "Because that flagpole is 15 feet tall, the Sun is at ''x'' angle, and laws of [[electromagnetism]]".&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  Yet by problem of symmetry, if one instead asked, "Why is that flagpole 15 feet tall?", another could answer, "Because that shadow is 20 feet long, the Sun is at ''x'' angle, and laws of electromagnetism", likewise a deduction from observed conditions and scientific laws, but an answer clearly incorrect.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  By the problem of irrelevance, if one asks, "Why did that man not get pregnant?", one could in part answer, among the explanans, "Because he took birth control pills"—if he factually took them, and the law of their preventing pregnancy—as covering law model poses no restriction to bar that observation from the explanans.

Many [[philosophy of science|philosophers]] have concluded that causality is integral to scientific explanation.&lt;ref name=OShaughnessy&gt;O'Shaughnessy, ''Explaining Buyer Behavior'' (Oxford U P, 1992), [https://books.google.com/books?id=magj7kNrbpsC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq= pp 17–19].&lt;/ref&gt;  DN model offers a necessary condition of a causal explanation—successful prediction—but not sufficient conditions of causal explanation, as a universal regularity can include spurious relations or simple correlations, for instance ''Z'' always following ''Y'', but not ''Z'' because of ''Y'', instead ''Y'' and then ''Z'' as an effect of ''X''.&lt;ref name=OShaughnessy/&gt;  By relating temperature, pressure, and volume of gas within a container, [[Boyle's law]] permits prediction of an unknown variable—volume, pressure, or temperature—but does not explain ''why'' to expect that unless one adds, perhaps, the [[kinetic theory of gases]].&lt;ref name=OShaughnessy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spohn-idealgas/&gt;

Scientific explanations increasingly pose not [[determinism]]'s universal laws, but [[probabilism]]'s chance,&lt;ref name=Karhausen/&gt; ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' laws.&lt;ref name=cplaws/&gt;  Smoking's contribution to [[lung cancer]] fails even the inductive-statistical model (IS model), requiring probability over 0.5 (50%).&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 3], subch "Repudiation of DN model of explanation", pp 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;  (Probability standardly ranges from 0 (0%) to 1 (100%).)  An [[applied science]] that applies [[statistics]] seeking associations between events, [[epidemiology]] cannot show causality, but consistently found higher incidence of lung cancer in smokers versus otherwise similar nonsmokers, although the proportion of smokers who develop lung cancer is modest.&lt;ref name=Rothman-Greenland&gt;{{Cite journal

See "Notes", [https://books.google.com/books?id=hCfk8tZix6oC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=atomism pp 79–80], #12 for views of Mach and of Ostwald, #13 for views of contemporary physicists generally, and #14 for views of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]].  The more relevant here is #12: "Mach seems to have had several closely related opinions concerning [[atomism]].  First, he often thought the theory might be useful in physics as long as one did not believe in the [[scientific realism|reality]] of atoms.  Second, he believed it was difficult to apply the atomic theory to both psychology and physics.  Third, his own theory of elements is often called an 'atomistic theory' in psychology in contrast with both gestalt theory and a continuum theory of experience.  Fourth, when critical of the reality of atoms, he normally meant the Greek sense of 'indivisible substance' and thought Boltzmann was being evasive by advocating divisible atoms or 'corpuscles' such as would become normal after [[J J Thomson]] and the distinction between [[electron]]s and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]].  Fifth, he normally called physical atoms 'things of thought' and was very happy when Ostwald seemed to refute the reality of atoms in 1905.  And sixth, after Ostwald returned to atomism in 1908, Mach continued to defend Ostwald's 'energeticist' alternative to atomism".&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, via statistical mechanics, [[Albert Einstein]] predicted the phenomenon [[Brownian motion]]—unexplained since reported in 1827 by botanist [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]].&lt;ref name=NewburghEtAl/&gt;  Soon, most physicists accepted that atoms and molecules were unobservable yet real.&lt;ref name=NewburghEtAl/&gt;  Also in 1905, Einstein explained the electromagnetic field's energy as distributed in ''particles'', doubted until this helped resolve [[atomic theory]] in the 1910s and 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;
Physicists had explained the electromagnetic field's energy as ''mechanical'' energy, like an ocean wave's bodily impact, not water droplets individually showered (Grandy, ''Everyday Quantum Reality'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-Tmtb-XvwcC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq= pp 22–23]).  In the 1890s, the problem of [[blackbody radiation]] was paradoxical until [[Max Planck]] theorized ''[[quantum]]'' exhibiting [[Planck's constant]]—a minimum unit of energy.  The quanta were mysterious, not viewed as ''particles'', yet simply as units of ''energy''.  Another paradox, however, was the [[photoelectric effect]].
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As shorter wavelength yields more waves per unit distance, lower wavelength is higher wave frequency.  Within the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]'s visible portion, frequency sets the color.  Light's intensity, however, is the wave's amplitude as the wave's height.  In a strictly wave explanation, a greater intensity—higher wave amplitude—raises the mechanical energy delivered, namely, the wave's impact, and thereby yields greater physical effect.  And yet in the photoelectric effect, only a certain color and beyond—a certain frequency and higher—was found to knock electrons off a metal surface. Below that frequency or color, raising the intensity of the light still knocked no electrons off.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Einstein modeled Planck's quanta as each a particle whose individual energy was Planck's constant multiplied by the light's wave's frequency: at only a certain frequency and beyond would each particle be energetic enough to eject an electron from its orbital.  Although elevating the intensity of light would deliver more energy—more total particles—each individual particle would still lack sufficient energy to dislodge an electron.  Einstein's model, far more intricate, used [[probability theory]] to explain rates of elections ejections as rates of collisions with electromagnetic particles.  This revival of the [[particle theory of light|particle hypothesis of light]]—generally attributed to Newton—was widely doubted.  By 1920, however, the explanation helped solve problems in [[atomic theory]], and thus [[quantum mechanics]] emerged.  In 1926, [[Gilbert N Lewis]] termed the particles ''[[photon]]s''.  [[quantum electrodynamics|QED]] models them as the electromagnetic field's [[messenger particle]]s or force carriers, emitted and absorbed by electrons and by other particles undergoing transitions.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, all known physical phenomena were gravitational or [[timeline of electromagnetic theory|electromagnetic]],&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson, ''Simply Einstein'' (W W Norton &amp; Co, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=FwNJ_PDRnbkC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=Wrap p 67].&lt;/ref&gt; whose two theories misaligned.&lt;ref&gt;Newton's gravitational theory at 1687 had postulated [[absolute space and time|absolute space and absolute time]].  To fit [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]]'s [[transverse wave]] theory of light at 1804, space was theoretically filled with [[Augustin Fresnel|Fresnel]]'s [[luminiferous aether]] at 1814.  By [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s electromagnetic field theory of 1865, light always holds a constant speed, which, however, must be relative to something, apparently to aether.  Yet if light's speed is constant relative to aether, then a body's motion through aether would be relative to—thus vary in relation to—light's speed.  Even Earth's vast speed, multiplied by experimental ingenuity with an [[interferometer]] by [[Michelson–Morley experiment|Michelson &amp; Morley at 1887]], revealed no apparent ''aether drift''—light speed apparently constant, an absolute.  Thus, both Newton's gravitational theory and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory each had its own relativity principle, yet the two were incompatible.  For brief summary, see Wilczek, ''Lightness of Being'' (Basic Books, 2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iWhxK12fbA4C&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq= pp 78–80].&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet belief in aether as the source of all physical phenomena was virtually unanimous.&lt;ref&gt;Cordero, ''EPSA Philosophy of Science'' (Springer, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e0B_VtFeSi4C&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=ether pp 26–28].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, ''Aether and Gravitation'' (Chapman &amp; Hall, 1903), [https://books.google.com/books?id=cgoQAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=Aether pp 122–23].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lodge&gt;Lodge, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FgYiAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=action+constitute+distance+electron+empty+space+gravitation+Optical "The ether of space"], ''Sci Am Suppl'', 1909; '''67''':202–03.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Even Mach, who shunned all hypotheses beyond direct sensory experience, presumed an aether, required for motion to not violate [[mechanical philosophy]]'s founding principle, ''No instant inter[[action at a distance]]'' (Einstein, "Ether", ''Sidelights'' (Methuen, 1922), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vwZlfF3sVJEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA617&amp;dq=special pp 15–18]).&lt;/ref&gt;  At experimental paradoxes,&lt;ref&gt;
Rowlands, ''Oliver Lodge'' (Liverpool U P, 1990), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7BfLxqkSgBEC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq= pp 159–60]: "[[Sir Oliver Lodge|Lodge]]'s [[luminiferous aether|ether]] experiments have become part of the historical background leading up to the establishment of [[special relativity]] and their significance is usually seen in this context.  Special relativity, it is stated, eliminated both the ether and the concept of absolute motion from physics.  Two experiments were involved: that of Michelson and Morley, which showed that bodies do not move with respect to a stationary ether, and that of Lodge, which showed that moving bodies do not drag ether with them.  With the emphasis on relativity, the [[Michelson–Morley]] experiment has come to be seen as the more significant of the two, and Lodge's experiment becomes something of a detail, a matter of eliminating the final, and less likely, possibility of a nonstationary, viscous, all-pervading medium.

It could be argued that almost the exact opposite may have been the case.  The Michelson–Morley experiment did not prove that there was no absolute motion, and it did not prove that there was no stationary ether.  Its results—and the [[FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction]]—could have been predicted on [[Oliver Heaviside|Heaviside]]'s, or even [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s, theory, even if no experiment had ever taken place.  The significance of the experiment, though considerable, is purely historical, and in no way factual.  Lodge's experiment, on the other hand, showed that, if an ether existed, then its properties must be quite different from those imagined by mechanistic theorists.  The ether which he always believed existed had to acquire entirely new properties as a result of this work".&lt;/ref&gt; physicists modified the aether's hypothetical properties.&lt;ref&gt;Mainly [[Hendrik Lorentz]] as well as [[Henri Poincaré]] modified [[classical electrodynamics|electrodynamic theory]] and, more or less, developed special theory of relativity before Einstein did (Ohanian, ''Einstein's Mistakes'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=4DunN-eD3VIC&amp;pg=PA282&amp;dq= pp 281–85]).  Yet Einstein, free a thinker, took the next step and stated it, more elegantly, without aether (Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P180&amp;dq=Lorentz+Einstein p 180]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Inertia is the state of a body experiencing no acceleration, whether by change in speed—either quickening or slowing—or by change in direction, and thus exhibits constant [[velocity]], which is speed plus direction.&lt;/ref&gt; which, by omitting aether,&lt;ref name=Cordero-p29-30&gt;Cordero, ''EPSA Philosophy of Science'' (Springer, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e0B_VtFeSi4C&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=ether pp 29–30].&lt;/ref&gt; converted space and time into ''relative'' phenomena whose relativity aligned [[classical electrodynamics|electrodynamics]] with the Newtonian principle [[Galilean invariance|Galilean relativity or invariance]].&lt;ref name=Schwarz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;To explain absolute light speed without aether, Einstein modeled that a body at motion in an electromagnetic field experiences [[length contraction]] and [[time dilation]], which [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]] and [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] had already modeled as [[Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction]] and [[Lorentz transformation]] but by hypothesizing [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] states of the aether, whereas Einstein's special relativity was simply [[kinematics|kinematic]], that is, positing no causal mechanical explanation, simply describing positions, thus showing how to align measuring devices, namely, clocks and rods.  (Ohanian, ''Einstein's Mistakes'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=4DunN-eD3VIC&amp;pg=PA282&amp;dq= pp 281–85]).&lt;/ref&gt;   Originally [[epistemic]] or [[instrumentalism|instrumental]], this was interpreted as [[ontic]] or [[scientific realism|realist]]—that is, a causal mechanical explanation—and the ''principle'' became a ''theory'',&lt;ref&gt;Ohanian, ''Einstein's Mistakes'' (W W Norton, 2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4DunN-eD3VIC&amp;pg=PA282&amp;dq= pp 281–85].&lt;/ref&gt; refuting Newtonian gravitation.&lt;ref name=Cordero-p29-30/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton's theory required [[absolute space and time]].&lt;/ref&gt;  By predictive success [[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|in 1919]], [[general relativity]] apparently overthrew [[Newton's theory]], a revolution in science&lt;ref&gt;Buchen, [https://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2009/05/dayintech_0529 "May 29, 1919"], ''Wired'', 2009.&lt;br&gt;Moyer, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4684-3596-2_4 "Revolution"], in ''Studies in the Natural Sciences'' (Springer, 1979), p 55.&lt;br&gt;Melia, ''Black Hole'' (Princeton U P, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=nmBLT-X5bOQC&amp;pg=PA83 pp 83–87].&lt;/ref&gt; resisted by many yet fulfilled around 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Crelinsten, ''Einstein's Jury'' (Princeton U P, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=W1Dt15vWYGQC&amp;pg=PA296&amp;dq=1928 p 28].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, [[Werner Heisenberg]] as well as [[Erwin Schrödinger]] independently formalized [[quantum mechanics]] (QM).&lt;ref name=QMformalisms/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cushing-p113-18&gt;Cushing, ''Quantum Mechanics'' (U Chicago P, 1994), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kTewHaL8fvgC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq= pp 113–18].&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite clashing explanations,&lt;ref name=Cushing-p113-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=QMs&gt;Schrödinger's [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]] posed an [[electron]]'s charge smeared across space as a [[wavefunction|waveform]], later reinterpreted as the electron [[probability amplitude|manifesting across space probabilistically but nowhere definitely]] while eventually building up that deterministic waveform.  Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics]] confusingly talked of ''[[operator (quantum mechanics)|operator]]s'' acting on ''[[quantum state]]s''. [[Richard Feynman]] introduced QM's [[path integral formulation|path integral]] formalism—interpretable as a particle traveling all paths imaginable, canceling themselves, leaving just one, the most efficient—predictively identical with Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics|matrix]] formalism and with Schrödinger's [[Schrödinger's equation|wave]] formalism.&lt;/ref&gt; the two theories made identical predictions.&lt;ref name=QMformalisms/&gt;  [[Paul Dirac]]'s 1928 [[Dirac equation|model of the electron]] was set to [[special relativity]], launching [[quantum mechanics|QM]] into the first [[quantum field theory]] (QFT), [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED).&lt;ref name=Torretti-p393-95&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P393&amp;dq= pp 393–95].&lt;/ref&gt;  From it, Dirac interpreted and predicted the electron's [[antiparticle]], soon discovered and termed ''[[positron]]'',&lt;ref name=Torretti-p394&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P394&amp;dq= p 394].&lt;/ref&gt; but the QED failed electrodynamics at high energies.&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395/&gt;  Elsewhere and otherwise, [[strong nuclear force]] and [[weak nuclear force]] were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Recognition of strong force permitted [[Manhattan Project]] to engineer [[Little Boy]] and [[Fat Man]], dropped on Japan, whereas effects of weak force were seen in its aftermath—[[radioactive fallout]]—of diverse health consequences.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, [[Richard Feynman]] introduced QM's [[path integral formulation|path integral]] formalism, which if taken toward ''interpretation'' as a causal mechanical model clashes with Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics|matrix]] formalism and with Schrödinger's [[Schrödinger's equation|wave]] formalism,&lt;ref name=QMs/&gt; although all three are empirically identical, sharing predictions.&lt;ref name=QMformalisms&gt;From 1925 to 1926, independently but nearly simultaneously, [[Werner Heisenberg]] as well as [[Erwin Schrödinger]] developed quantum mechanics (Zee in Feynman, ''QED'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR14&amp;dq= p xiv]).  Schrödinger introduced [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]], whose [[wave function]] is discerned by a [[partial differential equation]], now termed ''[[Schrödinger equation]]'' (p xiv).  Heisenberg, who also stated the [[uncertainty principle]], along with [[Max Born]] and [[Pascual Jordan]] introduced [[matrix mechanics]], which rather confusingly talked of ''[[operator (quantum mechanics)|operator]]s'' acting on ''[[quantum state]]s'' (p xiv).  If taken as causal mechanically [[explanatory]], the two formalisms vividly disagree, and yet are indiscernible [[empirically]], that is, when not used for ''interpretation'', and taken as simply ''[[scientific formalism|formalism]]'' ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq= p xv]).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1941, at a party in a tavern in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], visiting physicist Herbert Jehle mentioned to [[Richard Feynman]] a different formalism suggested by [[Paul Dirac]], who developed [[bra–ket notation]], in 1932 (p xv).  The next day, Feynman completed Dirac's suggested approach as ''[[sum over histories]]'' or ''[[sum over paths]]'' or ''[[path integral formulation|path integrals]]'' (p xv).  Feynman would joke that this approach—which sums all possible paths that a particle could take, as though the particle actually takes them all, canceling themselves out except for one pathway, the particle's most efficient—abolishes the uncertainty principle ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq= p xvi]).  All empirically equivalent, Schrödinger's wave formalism, Heisenberg's matrix formalism, and Feynman's path integral formalism all incorporate the uncertain principle (p xvi).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There is no particular barrier to additional formalisms, which could be, simply have not been, developed and widely disseminated ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq= p xvii]).  In a particular physical discipline, however, and on a particular problem, one of the three formalisms might be easier than others to operate ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq= pp xvi–xvii]).  By the 1960s, path integral formalism virtually vanished from use, while matrix formalism was the "canonical" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq= p xvii]).  In the 1970s, path integral formalism made a "roaring comeback", became the predominant means to make predictions from [[quantum field theory|QFT]], and impelled Feynman to an aura of mystique ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR18&amp;dq= p xviii]).&lt;/ref&gt;  Next, working on QED, Feynman sought to model particles without fields and find the vacuum truly empty.&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt;  As each known [[fundamental force]]&lt;ref&gt;The four, known [[fundamental interactions]] are gravitational, electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear.&lt;/ref&gt; is apparently an effect of a field, Feynman failed.&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt;  [[Louis de Broglie]]'s [[waveparticle duality]] had rendered [[atomism]]—indivisible particles in a void—untenable, and highlighted the very notion of discontinuous particles as selfcontradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Grandy, ''Everyday Quantum Reality'' (Indiana U P, 2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-Tmtb-XvwcC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq= pp 24–25].&lt;/ref&gt;

Meeting in 1947, [[Freeman Dyson]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[Julian Schwinger]], and [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]] soon introduced ''[[renormalization]]'', a procedure converting QED to physics' most predictively precise theory,&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P395&amp;dq= p 395].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schweber&gt;Schweber, [https://books.google.com/books/about/QED_and_the_Men_who_Made_it.html?id=61n5dE7FJQgC ''QED and the Men who Made it''] (Princeton U P, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; subsuming [[chemistry]], [[optics]], and [[statistical mechanics]].&lt;ref name=Schwarz/&gt;&lt;ref name=Feynman&gt;Feynman, ''QED'' (Princeton U P, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=chemistry p 5].&lt;/ref&gt;  QED thus won physicists' general acceptance.&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395-96/&gt;  [[Paul Dirac]] criticized its need for renormalization as showing its unnaturalness,&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395-96&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'', (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P395&amp;dq=Dirac pp 395–96].&lt;/ref&gt; and called for an aether.&lt;ref name=Cushing-p158-59&gt;Cushing, ''Quantum Mechanics'' (U Chicago P, 1994), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kTewHaL8fvgC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=ether+Dirac+medium+vacuum#v=twopage pp 158–59].&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1947, [[Willis Lamb]] had found unexpected motion of [[electron configuration|electron orbitals]], [[Lamb shift|shift]]ed since the vacuum is not truly empty.&lt;ref&gt;Close, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/blog/tag/ether "Much ado about nothing"], ''Nova'', PBS/WGBH, 2012:

"This new quantum mechanical view of nothing began to emerge in 1947, when [[Willis Lamb]] measured spectrum of hydrogen.  The electron in a hydrogen atom cannot move wherever it pleases but instead is restricted to specific paths.  This is analogous to climbing a ladder: You cannot end up at arbitrary heights above ground, only those where there are rungs to stand on.  Quantum mechanics explains the spacing of the rungs on the atomic ladder and predicts the frequencies of radiation that are emitted or absorbed when an electron switches from one to another.  According to the state of the art in 1947, which assumed the hydrogen atom to consist of just an electron, a proton, and an electric field, two of these rungs have identical energy. However, Lamb's measurements showed that these two rungs differ in energy by about one part in a million.  What could be causing this tiny but significant difference?

"When physicists drew up their simple picture of the atom, they had forgotten something: Nothing.  Lamb had become the first person to observe experimentally that the vacuum is not empty, but is instead seething with ephemeral electrons and their anti-matter analogues, positrons.  These electrons and positrons disappear almost instantaneously, but in their brief mayfly moment of existence they alter the shape of the atom's electromagnetic field slightly.  This momentary interaction with the electron inside the hydrogen atom kicks one of the rungs of the ladder just a bit higher than it would be otherwise.
&lt;br&gt;
"This is all possible because, in quantum mechanics, energy is not conserved on very short timescales, or for very short distances.  Stranger still, the more precisely you attempt to look at something—or at nothing—the more dramatic these energy fluctuations become.  Combine that with Einstein's E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which implies that energy can congeal in material form, and you have a recipe for particles that bubble in and out of existence even in the void.  This effect allowed Lamb to literally measure something from nothing".&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet ''emptiness'' was catchy, abolishing aether conceptually, and physics proceeded ostensibly without it,&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt; even suppressing it.&lt;ref name=Cushing-p158-59/&gt;  Meanwhile, "sickened by untidy math, most [[philosophy of physics|philosophers of physics]] tend to neglect QED".&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395-96/&gt;

According to this theory, light consists of wave-like vibrations in an invisible medium called the ether, which was supposed to permeate the whole universe.  (The rival to the wave theory was the particle theory of light, favoured by Newton, which held that light consists of very small particles emitted by the light source.)  The wave theory was not widely accepted until the French physicist Auguste Fresnel formulated a mathematical version of the theory in 1815, and used it to predict some surprising new optical phenomena.  Optical experiments confirmed Fresnel's predictions, convincing many 19th-century scientists that the wave theory of light must be true.  But modern physics tells us that the theory is not true: there is no such thing as the ether, so light doesn't consist of vibrations in it.

A classic case is the aether, a substance that was supposed by nineteenth-century physicists to permeate all space and make it possible for electromagnetic radiation (like light) to propagate.  It was Einstein's special theory of relativity, proposed in 1905, that did away with the necessity of aether, and the concept has been relegated to the dustbin of scientific history ever since.

Note that the cutoff, though very large, in any case is finite".&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[gluons|QCD's particles]] are considered nonexistent in the everyday world,&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt; QCD especially suggests an aether,&lt;ref name=Wilczek-p73/&gt; routinely found by physics experiments to exist and to exhibit relativistic symmetry.&lt;ref name=Laughlin-quote&gt;Laughlin, ''A Different Universe'', (Basic Books, 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=djQKg_XBsLEC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq= pp 120–21]: "The word 'ether' has extremely negative connotations in theoretical physics because of its past association with opposition to relativity.  This is unfortunate because, stripped of these connotations, it rather nicely captures the way most physicists actually think about the vacuum.  ...  Relativity actually says nothing about the existence or nonexistence of matter pervading the universe, only that any such matter must have relativistic symmetry.  It turns out that such matter exists.  About the time that relativity was becoming accepted, studies of radioactivity began showing that the empty vacuum of space had spectroscopic structure similar to that of ordinary quantum solids and fluids.  Subsequent studies with large particle accelerators have now led us to understand that space is more like a piece of window glass than ideal Newtonian emptiness.  It is filled with 'stuff' that is normally transparent but can be made visible by hitting it sufficiently hard to knock out a part.  The modern concept of the vacuum of space, confirmed every day by experiment, is a relativistic ether.  But we do not call it this because it is taboo".&lt;/ref&gt;  Confirmation of the [[Higgs particle]], modeled as a condensation within the [[Higgs field]], corroborates aether,&lt;ref name=Vongehr/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jegerlehner/&gt; although physics need not state or even include aether.&lt;ref name=Vongehr/&gt;  Organizing regularities of ''observations''—as in the covering law model—physicists find superfluous the quest to discover ''aether''.&lt;ref name=Ben-Menahem/&gt;

In 1905, from [[special relativity]], Einstein deduced [[mass–energy equivalence]],&lt;ref&gt;Mass–energy equivalence is formalized in the equation E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; particles being variant forms of distributed energy,&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, "Ether", ''Sidelights'' (Methuen, 1922), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vwZlfF3sVJEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA616&amp;dq=special p 13]: "[A]ccording to the special theory of relativity, both matter and radiation are but special forms of distributed energy, ponderable mass losing its isolation and appearing as a special form of energy".&lt;/ref&gt; how [[particle accelerator|particles colliding at vast speed]] experience that energy's transformation into mass, producing heavier particles,&lt;ref&gt;Braibant, Giacomelli &amp; Spurio, ''Particles and Fundamental Interactions'' (Springer, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e8YUUG2pGeIC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=electron+proton+neutron+collisions p 2]: "Any particle can be created in collisions between two high energy particles thanks to a process of transformation of energy in mass".&lt;/ref&gt; although physicists' talk promotes confusion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Greene]] explained, "People often have the wrong image of what happens inside the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]], and I am just as guilty as anyone of perpetuating it.  The machine does not smash together particles to pulverise them and see what is inside.  Rather, it collides them at extremely high energy.  Since, by dint of Einstein's famous equation, [[mass-energy equivalence|E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], energy and mass are one and the same, the combined energy of the collision can be converted into a mass, in other words, a particle, that is heavier than either of the colliding [[proton]]s.  The more energy is involved in the collision, the heavier the particles that might come into being" [Avent, [https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2012/07/qa-brian-greene "The Q&amp;A"], ''Economist'', 2012].&lt;/ref&gt;  As "the contemporary locus of [[metaphysical]] research", QFTs pose particles not as existing individually, yet as ''excitation modes'' of fields,&lt;ref name=Torretti-p396&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P396&amp;dq= p 396].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuhlmann/&gt; the particles and their masses being states of aether,&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13&gt;Wilczek, [http://ctpweb.lns.mit.edu/physics_today/phystoday/Ether.pdf "The persistence of ether"], ''Phys Today'', 1999; '''52''':11,13, p 13.&lt;/ref&gt; apparently unifying all physical phenomena as the more fundamental causal reality,&lt;ref name=Riesselmann/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jegerlehner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilczek-p73&gt;Wilczek, ''Lightness of Being'' (Basic Books, 2008), ch 8 "The grid (persistence of ether)", [https://books.google.com/books?id=iWhxK12fbA4C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Ether+QCD p 73]: "For natural philosophy, the most important lesson we learn from [[quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] is that what we perceive as empty space is in reality a powerful medium whose activity molds the world.  Other developments in modern physics reinforce and enrich that lesson.  Later, as we explore the current frontiers, we'll see how the concept of 'empty' space as a rich, dynamic medium empowers our best thinking about how to achieve the unification of forces".&lt;/ref&gt; as long ago foreseen.&lt;ref name=Lodge/&gt;  Yet a ''quantum'' field is an intricate abstraction—a ''mathematical'' field—virtually inconceivable as a ''classical'' field's physical properties.&lt;ref name=Kuhlmann&gt;Kuhlmann, [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=physicists-debate-whether-world-made-of-particles-fields-or-something-else "Physicists debate"], ''Sci Am'', 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nature's deeper aspects, still unknown, might elude any possible field theory.&lt;ref name=Torretti-p396/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuhlmann/&gt;

(Whittaker, ''A History of Theories of Aether'' (Longmans, Green &amp; Co: 1910), [https://archive.org/stream/historyoftheorie00whitrich#page/18/mode/2up pp 17–18])&lt;/ref&gt;  By now, most [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicists]] infer that the four, known [[fundamental interactions]] would reduce to [[superstring theory]], whereby atoms and molecules, after all, are energy vibrations holding mathematical, geometric forms.&lt;ref name=Schwarz/&gt;  Given uncertainties of [[scientific realism]],&lt;ref name=Bolotin-realism&gt;Challenges to [[scientific realism]] are captured succinctly by Bolotin, ''Approach to Aristotle's Physics'' (SUNY P, 1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=LLqB1IfeSZ0C&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq= pp 33–34], commenting about modern science, "But it has not succeeded, of course, in encompassing all phenomena, at least not yet.  For it laws are mathematical idealizations, idealizations, moreover, with no immediate basis in experience and with no evident connection to the ultimate causes of the natural world.  For instance, [[Newton's first law of motion]] (the law of inertia) requires us to imagine a body that is always at rest or else moving aimlessly in a straight line at a constant speed, even though we never see such a body, and even though according to his own theory of universal gravitation, it is impossible that there can be one.  This fundamental law, then, which begins with a claim about what would happen in a situation that never exists, carries no conviction except insofar as it helps to predict observable events.  Thus, despite the amazing success of Newton's laws in predicting the observed positions of the planets and other bodies, Einstein and Infeld are correct to say, in ''[[The Evolution of Physics]]'', that 'we can well imagine another system, based on different assumptions, might work just as well'.  Einstein and Infeld go on to assert that 'physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not, however it may seem, uniquely determined by the external world'.  To illustrate what they mean by this assertion, they compare the modern scientist to a man trying to understand the mechanism of a closed watch.  If he is ingenious, they acknowledge, this man 'may form some picture of a mechanism which would be responsible for all the things he observes'.  But they add that he 'may never quite be sure his picture is the only one which could explain his observations.  He will never be able to compare his picture with the real mechanism and he cannot even imagine the possibility or the meaning of such a comparison'.  In other words, modern science cannot claim, and it will never be able to claim, that it has the definite understanding of any natural phenomenon".&lt;/ref&gt; some conclude that the concept ''causality'' raises comprehensibility of scientific explanation and thus is key [[folk science]], but compromises precision of scientific explanation and is dropped as a science matures.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, [http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/003004.pdf "Causation as folk science"], in Price &amp; Corry, eds, ''Mature Causation, Physics, and the Constitution of Reality'' (Oxford U P, 2007), esp [https://books.google.com/books?id=oCXe4DvqUFMC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq= p 12].&lt;/ref&gt;  Even [[epidemiology]] is maturing to heed the severe difficulties with presumptions about causality.&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Karhausen&gt;{{Cite journal

'''''Double Helix''''' (2004), a novel by [[Nancy Werlin]], is about 18-year-old Eli Samuels, who works for a famous [[molecular biologist]] named Dr. Quincy Wyatt.  There is a mysterious connection between Dr. Wyatt and Eli’s parents, and all Eli knows about the connection is that it has something to do with his mother, who has [[Huntington's disease]].  Because of the connection between Dr. Wyatt and the Samuels family, Eli's father is strongly against Eli working there.  The job is perfect, and the wages are great, but Eli can't help but notice that Dr. Wyatt seems to be a little ''too'' interested in him.  Later on, as Eli continues to work in the lab, he discovers with the help of Kayla Matheson, Dr. Wyatt's supposed "niece," that he and Kayla are the product of a highly [[unethical]] [[eugenics]] experiment.

==Characters==
* '''Eli Samuels''': Eli is 18 years old, 6′7″ (201 centimeters) tall. He's an A student, and is the salutatorian in high school. His mother has Huntington's disease, which he could have too.
* '''Jonathan Samuels''': Jonathan Samuels is Eli's father, who loved his wife. He has a problem with Eli working at Wyatt Transgenic's, because of things that went down in the past. He is initially completely unwilling to tell Eli anything about his mother's relationships with Dr. Wyatt.
* '''Dr. Quincy Wyatt''': Dr. Quincy Wyatt is a famed geneticist, who is considered to be on par with [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]], [[James Watson|Watson]], and [[Francis Crick|Crick]]. He offers Eli a job. He displays an unexplained interest in Eli.
* '''Vivian Fadiman''': Vivian Fadiman is Eli's girlfriend and [[Valedictorian]] at his high school. All she wants is to be part of his life and she supports him in everything he does. It's hard for her to understand why Eli hides major parts of his life from her. Eli is devoted to her, though they do go through some rough times.
* '''Kayla Matheson''': A year older than Eli, he gets to know her via Dr. Wyatt. He is attracted to her because of her beauty and athleticism.
* '''Ava Samuels''': Ava Samuels was Eli's mother and lived in a nursing home because of her [[Huntington's disease]]. She had a mysterious connection with Dr. Wyatt.

==Themes==
The story addresses a lot of recent scientific breakthroughs, and uses them as plot devices.  For instance, [[Human Genome Project|The Human Genome Project]], which documents all the genes and DNA in the human genetic makeup, is talked about when Dr. Wyatt explains his genetic testing to Eli for the first time.  [[Scientific American]] recently published an article detailing the possible uses for the information gathered from the Human Genome Project.  Modern advancements in gene studies currently can detect and, in some cases, even predict the presence of a genetic abnormality.  In Double Helix, this ability to detect flaws before birth was used to [[genetic engineering|genetically engineer]] a “more perfect son, devoid of flaws and with a proper chance to live free of [[Huntington's Disease|Huntington’s]].”

For some people, the biggest issue with genetic engineering is whether or not to seek out nd act on knowledge about genetic flaws. Double Helix attempts to explore the life saving and life destroying aspects of genetic engineering. The book proposes that, while Eli’s life was saved by avoiding the Huntington’s disease gene, his concept of life and self were destroyed when he found out he was genetically engineered to be a certain way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eugenicsonline.netfirms.com/issues.htm Eugenics Online Issues&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229144845/http://www.eugenicsonline.netfirms.com/issues.htm |date=December 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nancywerlin.com/aboutwriting.htm :: Nancy Werlin | Resources for Writers ::&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20120907041429/http://www.nancywerlin.com/aboutwriting.htm |date=September 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/014240327X Amazon.com: Double Helix (Puffin Sleuth Novels): Books: Nancy Werlin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discoveries ==

=== ''H. L. Hunley'' ===
[[File:CSSHLHunleyrecovery.jpg|thumb|''H. L. Hunley'', suspended from a crane during its recovery from Charleston Harbor, August 8, 2000. (''Photograph from the [[Naval Historical Center|U.S. Naval Historical Center]].)'']]
{{Main|H. L. Hunley (submarine)|}}
Spence first reported the discovery of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[submarine]] ''[[H. L. Hunley (submarine)|Hunley]]'' in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;"Diver Thinks he's Found the ''Hunley''", AP Wire story, ''The State,'' Columbia, SC, June 14, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Spence mapped and reported its location to numerous government agencies. The July 2007 cover story in ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' noted that the ''Hunley'' "disappeared without a trace" until 1970 when it was found by "underwater archaeologist E. Lee Spence."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070624/2hunley_2.htm Cover story: "Time Capsule From The Sea", ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', July 2–9, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; That report made no mention of novelist Clive Cussler, whose organization later (August 2008) dropped a lawsuit in federal district court against Spence in which it had claimed that they and not Spence had discovered the wreck in 1995. Both sides still claim that they and not the other discovered the wreck.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080824072657/http://www.charleston.net/news/2008/aug/23/cussler_ends_lawsuit_over_finding_hunley51831/#comments "Cussler ends lawsuit over finding Hunley", The Post &amp; Courier, August 23, 2008, article and 27 Comments]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13, 1976, the National Park Service submitted Sea Research Society's (Spence's) location for ''H.L. Hunley'' for inclusion on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Spence's location for ''Hunley'' became a matter of public record when ''H.L. Hunley's'' placement on that list was officially approved on December 29, 1978.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/org12-9a.htm Programmatic agreement on management of the wreck of ''H.L. Hunley'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Spence's book ''Treasures of the Confederate Coast'', which had a chapter on his discovery of ''Hunley'' and included a map complete with an ''"X"'' showing the wreck's location was published in January 1995.&lt;ref&gt;''Treasures of the Confederate Coast: The "Real Rhett Butler" &amp; Other Revelations'' by Dr. E. Lee Spence, Narwhal Press, Charleston/Miami, 1995, p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 the discovery was independently verified by a combined [[South Carolina Institute of Anthropology and Archaeology]] ([[SCIAA]]) and [[National Underwater and Marine Agency]] (NUMA) expedition directed by SCIAA underwater archaeologist Mark M. Newell&lt;ref&gt;NUMA Press Release, May 11, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; and funded in part by novelist [[Clive Cussler]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://shipwrecks.com/Hunley%20introduction%20Lee%20Spence's%20discovery%20sworn%20affidavit.htm Sworn Affidavit on discovery of the ''Hunley'' by E. Lee Spence, submitted to ''Hunley'' Commission on February 1, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same year, at the official request of Senator Glenn F. McConnell ([[chairman]]), of the State of South Carolina ''Hunley'' Commission, Spence donated all of his rights to the [[shipwreck]] to the State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shipwrecks.com/Condon092095.htm Attorney General Charles M. Condon's letter of September 20, 1995, to Spence]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Hunley: Submarines, Sacrifice &amp; Success in the Civil War'' by Mark Ragan (Narwhal Press, Charleston/Miami, 1995) p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Hunley'' discovery was described by William Dudley, Director of Naval History at the [[Naval Historical Center]] as probably the most important (underwater archaeological) find of the (20th) century."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehunley.com/factsheet.htm ''H.L. Hunley'' Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; The tiny [[submarine]] and its contents have been valued at over $40,000,000 making the [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]] and [[donation]] one of the most significant and valuable contributions ever made to the State of South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hunleyarchives.org/Beasley112095.jpg |title=Governor David Beasley's letter of November 20, 1995, to Spence |accessdate=2017-04-24 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020924202450/http://hunleyarchives.org/Beasley112095.jpg |archivedate=September 24, 2002 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hunleyarchives.org/McConnell092195.jpg |title=State Senator Glenn F.

In 2016 the [[Naval History and Heritage Command]] published a detailed report on the history, discovery, and restoration of the ''Hunley'' entitled ''H. L. Hunley: Recovery Operations'' suggesting that it is most likely Spence found a nearby buried navigation buoy rather than the ''Hunley''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/nhhc/research/underwater-archaeology/PDF/HLHunley_RecoveryOperations_20161123_FINAL_20170216.pdf H.

=== Other discoveries ===
[[File:Spence with KM17 Dive Helmet.jpg|right|thumb|Spence with KM17 Diving Helmet]]
In addition to the ''[[H.L. Hunley|Hunley]]'', Spence has discovered several historically significant shipwrecks, including the {{SS|Georgiana}}&lt;ref&gt;"''Georgiana'' Wreck Confirmed", ''[[The Post and Courier|The News &amp; Courier]],'' Charleston, SC, p. 1-D&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia Of Civil War Shipwrecks'' by W. Craig Gaines, Louisiana State University Press, 2008, pp. 146, 147&lt;/ref&gt; (said to have been the most powerful [[cruiser]] built by the [[Confederate States of America]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' March 30, 1863,p.4, c.1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Confederate States Navy From its Organization to the Surrender of its Last Vessel'', by J. Thomas Scharf, (New York, New York, 1887), p.802&lt;/ref&gt;

South Carolina's law protecting both the state's and the salvors' interests in shipwrecks was passed following Spence's discovery of the ''Georgiana'' and his company Shipwrecks Inc. was granted South Carolina State Salvage License #1.&lt;ref&gt;"Hulks of Confederate Blockade Runners Yield Cargo", ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 12, 1971, p. 83:3&lt;/ref&gt;

Spence states he has salvaged over $50,000,000 in valuable artifacts&lt;ref&gt;''Treasures of The Confederate Coast: the "Real Rhett Butler" &amp; Other Revelations'', by Dr. E. Lee Spence, (Narwhal Press, Charleston/Miami, 1995), "About the Author" by Charles King, p. 517&lt;/ref&gt; and has been responsible, through his archival research, for the location of the wrecks of the side-paddle-wheel steamers ''[[SS Republic (1853)|Republic]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coxwashington.com/reporters/content/reporters/stories/2007/06/06/BC_ODYSSEY_ADV03_COX.html "Ocean Treasure Company Has a Murky History" by Jeff Nesmith, Cox News Service, June 3, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120091525/http://www.coxwashington.com/reporters/content/reporters/stories/2007/06/06/BC_ODYSSEY_ADV03_COX.html |date=November 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[SS Central America|Central America]]''&lt;ref&gt;Cover story: "Treasure" ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, March 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cover story: "Milliard-Skatten", ''[[Vi Menn]]'' magazine (Norway) November 1989, pp. 4-7&lt;/ref&gt; from which over one billion dollars in treasure has been recovered.&lt;ref&gt;£600M Gold in Them Thar Holds" ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', London, September 16, 1989, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edict.homelinux.net/1884/427127.html ''Famous Treasure Hunters'']&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, 1989, Spence announced his discovery that [[Margaret Mitchell]], who had claimed her [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning novel ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'' was pure fiction, had actually taken much of her compelling story of love, greed and war from real life&lt;ref&gt;"Newsmakers: Frankly, My Dear, Historian is on Pins and Needles," ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', April 4, 1989, p. 2-A&lt;/ref&gt; and that Mitchell had actually based [[Rhett Butler]] on the life of [[George Alfred Trenholm]], a tall, handsome, shipping [[magnate]] from Charleston, South Carolina, who had made millions of dollars from [[blockade running]] and was accused of making off with much of the Confederate treasury and had been thrown in prison after the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;''Oggi'' ([http://www.mondotimes.com/2/topics/3/news/1/17417 Italian weekly magazine]), 5 dicembre 1994, pp. 38-40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Rhett Butler Connection," ''Treasure Diver,'' Volume 1, Number One, pp. 35-40&lt;/ref&gt; Spence's literary discovery that had its roots in his prior discoveries of some of Trenholm's wrecked blockade runners made international news.&lt;ref&gt;"Rhett Butler," ''[[La Stampa]]'', Turin, Italy, 18/4/1989, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Encyclopedia Of Civil War Shipwrecks'' by W.

'''Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2''' ('''eIF2''') is a [[eukaryotic initiation factor]]. It is required for most forms of eukaryotic [[Translation (biology)|translation]] initiation. eIF2 mediates the binding of [[tRNA]]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Met&lt;/sup&gt; to the ribosome in a [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]]-dependent manner. eIF2 is a heterotrimer consisting of an [[EIF2S1|alpha]] (also called subunit 1), a [[EIF2S2|beta]] (subunit 2), and a [[EIF2S3|gamma]] (subunit 3) subunit.

Once the initiation phase has completed, eIF2 is released from the ribosome bound to [[Guanosine diphosphate|GDP]] as an inactive binary complex. To participate in another round of translation initiation, this GDP must be exchanged for GTP.

==Function==
[[Image:Eukaryotic initiation.png |thumb|right |400px |The process of initiation of translation in eukaryotes with eIF2 in light-green. Other factors are shown, too.]]
eIF2 is an essential factor for protein synthesis that forms a ternary complex (TC) with [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] and the initiator [[Methionine|Met]]-[[tRNA]]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Met&lt;/sup&gt;. After its formation, the TC binds the [[Eukaryotic small ribosomal subunit (40S)|40S ribosomal subunit]] to form the [[43S preinitiation complex]] (43S PIC). 43S PIC assembly is believed to be stimulated by the [[Eukaryotic initiation factor|initiation factors]] [[eIF1]], [[eIF1AX|eIF1A]], and the [[eIF3]] complex according to ''in vitro'' experiments. The 43S PIC then binds [[messenger RNA|mRNA]] that has previously been unwound by the [[eIF4F]] complex. The 43S PIC and the eIF4F proteins form a new 48S complex on the mRNA, which starts searching along the mRNA for the [[start codon]] (AUG). Upon base pairing of the AUG-codon with the Met-tRNA, [[eIF5]] (which is a [[GTPase-activating protein]]) is recruited to the complex and induces eIF2 to hydrolyse its GTP. This causes eIF2-GDP to be released from this 48S complex and translation begins after recruitment of the [[60S]] ribosomal sub-unit and formation of the [[80S]] initiation complex. Finally, with the help of the [[Guanine nucleotide exchange factor]] [[eIF2B]],&lt;ref&gt;eIF2B consists of the sub-units [[EIF2B1]], [[EIF2B2]], [[EIF2B3]], [[EIF2B4]], [[EIF2B5]]&lt;/ref&gt; the GDP in eIF2 is exchanged for a GTP and the ternary complex reforms for a new round of translation initiation.

==Structure==
eIF2 is a heterotrimer of a total molar mass of 126 [[Dalton (unit)|kDa]] that is composed of the three sub-units: [[EIF2S1|α]] (sub-unit 1), [[EIF2S2|β]] (sub-unit 2), and [[EIF2S3|γ]] (sub-unit 3). 
The sequences of all three sub-units are highly conserved (pairwise amino acid identities for each sub-unit range from 47–72% when comparing the proteins of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' and ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'').

The '''α-subunit''' contains the main target for [[phosphorylation]], a [[serine]] at position 51. It also contains a S1 motif domain, which is a potential RNA binding-site. Therefore, the α-subunit can be considered the regulatory subunit of the trimer.

The '''β-subunit''' contains multiple phosphorylation sites (residues 2, 13, 67, 218). What is important to consider is that there are also three [[lysine]] clusters in the N-terminal domain (NTD), which are important for the interaction with eIF2B. Moreover, the sequence of the protein comprises a [[zinc-finger|zinc finger motif]] that was shown to play a role in both ternary complex and 43S preinitiation complex formation. There are also two guanine nucleotide-binding sequences that have not been shown to be involved in the regulation of eIF2 activity. The β-subunit is also believed to interact with both tRNA and mRNA.

The '''γ-sub-unit''' comprises three guanine nucleotide-binding sites and is known to be the main docking site for GTP/GDP. It also contains a tRNA-binding cavity that has been shown by [[X-ray crystallography]]. A zinc knuckle motif is able to bind one Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cation.&lt;ref name="pmid16153175"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid14688270"&gt;

eIF2 activity is regulated by a mechanism involving both guanine nucleotide exchange and [[phosphorylation]]. Phosphorylation takes place at the α-subunit, which is a target for a number of [[Serine/threonine-specific protein kinase|serine kinases]] that phosphorylate [[serine]] 51. Those kinases act as a result of stress such as amino acid deprivation ([[EIF2AK4|GCN2]]), ER stress ([[EIF2AK3|PERK]]), the presence of dsRNA ([[Protein kinase R|PKR]]) heme deficiency ([[Heme-regulated inhibitor kinase|HRI]]), or [[interferon]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once phosphorylated, eIF2 shows increased affinity for its [[Guanine nucleotide exchange factor]] eIF2B. However, eIF2B is able to exchange GDP for GTP only if eIF2 is in its unphosphorylated state. Phosphorylated eIF2, however, due to its stronger binding, acts as an inhibitor of its own GEF (eIF2B). Since the cellular concentration of eIF2B is much lower than that of eIF2, even a small amount of phosphorylated eIF2 can completely abolish eIF2B activity by sequestration. Without the GEF, eIF2 can no longer be returned to its active (GTP-bound) state. As a consequence, translation comes to a halt since initiation is no longer possible without any available ternary complex. Furthermore, low concentration of ternary complex allows the expression of GCN4 (starved condition), which, in turn, results in increased activation of amino acid synthesis genes&lt;ref name="pmid10216940"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid2687263"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16153175"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11042214"/&gt;&lt;ref name="test"&gt;

==Disease==
Since eIF2 is essential for most forms of translation initiation and therefore protein synthesis, defects in eIF2 are often lethal. The protein is highly conserved among evolutionary remote species - indicating a large impact of mutations on cell viability. Therefore, no diseases directly related to mutations in eIF2 can be observed. However, there are many illnesses caused by down-regulation of eIF2 through its upstream kinases. For example, increased concentrations of active PKR and inactive (phosphorylated) eIF2 were found in patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases such as [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s]], [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson’s]], and [[Huntington's disease|Huntington’s]] disease. There is also one proven example of a disease related to the GEF eIF2B. Mutations in all of the five subunits of eIF2B could be linked with [[leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter|leukoencephalopathy]], an illness that causes the brain’s white matter to disappear. It is still not fully understood why only brain cells seem to be affected by these defects. Potentially reduced levels of unstable regulatory proteins might play a role in the development of the diseases mentioned.&lt;ref name="pmid16153175"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17496426"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14585">'''Environmental peacebuilding''' examines and advocates environmental protection and cooperation as a factor in peaceful relations. Peacebuilding is both the theory and practice of identifying the conditions that can lead to a sustainable peace between those who have previously been adversaries, and assisting adversaries to move towards a sustainable peace. In the Middle East, common environmental challenges have been identified as a basis for regional cooperation and peacebuilding.  A small Middle Eastern civil society network reaches across adversarial boundaries to promote and practice environmental cooperation.

==Peacebuilding==

The study of [[peacebuilding]] (a term coined by Galtung, 1975)&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, Johan. 1975.  "Three approaches to peace: peacekeeping, peacemaking and peacebuilding." In Peace, War and Defence - Essays in Peace Research Vol. 2, 282-304. Copenhagen:  Christian Ejlers.&lt;/ref&gt; develops from interest in identifying the conditions that lead beyond a temporary cessation of violence to sustainable processes of conflict management and mutual cooperation between those who have previously been adversaries.  Lederach&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, John Paul.  Building Peace: Sustainable Reconciliation in Divided Societies (Washington, DC: United States Institute of Peace Press) 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; is most commonly cited, and his work has influenced national aid and development agencies, international agencies, and the network of NGOs that have placed peacebuilding on their agendas.  

Beginning with Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali promoting An Agenda for Peace in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;UN Secretary-General. 1992. "An Agenda for peace: preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping." UN Doc. A/47/277. June 17.&lt;/ref&gt; the United Nations adopted the language of peacebuilding and developed programs based on it.  Initiatives promoting human security and human rights share a similar concern with developing an international system that promotes the underlying conditions for the movement towards a peaceful world.

==Environmental peacebuilding==

Within the field of peacebuilding studies and practice, there is a sub-literature on environmental peacebuilding that examines the role of environmental factors in moving towards a sustainable peace.  At the most basic level, warfare devastates ecosystems and the livelihoods of those who depend on natural resources, and the anarchy of conflict situations leads to the uncontrolled, destructive exploitation of natural resources.  Preventing these impacts allows for an easier movement to a sustainable peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pugh|first=Jeffrey|date=December 2008|title=Challenges and opportunities of human conflict and environmental transformation in Ecuadorian highlands|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44201034_Challenges_and_opportunities_of_human_conflict_and_environmental_transformation_in_Ecuadorian_highlands|journal=Pirineos|volume=163|pages=63-75|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From a more positive perspective, environmental cooperation can be one of the places where hostile parties can sustain a dialogue, and sustainable development is a prerequisite for a sustainable peace.&lt;ref&gt;Carius, A.

Environment and Peacebuilding in War-torn Societies: Lessons from the UN Environment Programme's Experience with Postconflict Assessment. Global Governance, 15, 4, pp. 185-105.&lt;/ref&gt; note the relationship between environmental peacebuilding projects and studies of environment and conflict.  They observe that environmental challenges may be opportunities for peacebuilding, but they may also harden differences and reinforce conflict.  Environmental challenges are also usually complexly interconnected to economic and governance challenges.  Environmental issues are now routinely acknowledged as aspects of conflicts, and are necessarily part of the movement towards conflict management and the transformation of conflictual relations into peaceful ones.  

The United Nations Environment Programme has placed environmental conflict and cooperation on its agenda,&lt;ref&gt;UNEP. (2004). Understanding Environment, Conflict, and Cooperation. Nairobi: Kenya.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted environmental assessments of conflict zones and has recommended&lt;ref&gt;Halle, S. (Editor). (2009).

==Environmental peacebuilding in the Middle East==

The 1991 Madrid Conference, co-sponsored by the United States and the USSR, brought together representatives of the governments of Israel, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan, and a Palestinian delegation within the Jordanian delegation.  The conference established working groups on refugees, regional security, economic development, water, and environment.  The working groups on water and environment, and to some extent the one on economic development as well, had the agenda of bringing environmental cooperation and sustainable development into the formulation of a path to a sustainable 
Middle East peace.    

The subsequent Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Peace treaty between Jordan and Israel each had sections that envisioned joint committees on water, environmental cooperation and economic development.  When negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority stalled and relations again became strongly adversarial, progress towards cooperation on water, the environment and sustainable development also stalled.  At the formal level there are contacts across adversarial lines between government officials and experts, water infrastructure was kept out of the violence of the Second Intifadah, and there is some degree of cooperation – not widely publicized - on urgent water and environmental concerns.  Cooperative relations between Jordan and Israel have been maintained but progress is limited by the effects of the unresolved Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  

Diplomatic work on environmental peacebuilding in the region has been supplemented by the development of a small network of civil society organizations that promote and practice regional environmental cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenfeld, Stuart.  2010.  "Environment and Human Security in the Eastern Mediterranean: Regional Environmentalism in the Reframing of Palestinian-Israeli-Jordanian Relations" in P. H. Liotta, David Mouat, Judith Lancaster, Bill Kepner and David Smith, eds. Achieving Environmental Security: Ecosystem Services and Human Welfare. Amsterdam: IOS Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, A. (2008). Regional Water Cooperation and Peacebuilding in the Middle East.  Adelphi Research, Initiative For Peace.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations involved in environmental peacebuilding in the Middle East==
===Israel-Palestine Center for Research and Information===
[[Israel/Palestine_Center_for_Research_and_Information|IPCRI]] opened in 1989 during the first Intifada under joint Israeli and Palestinian directors.  IPCRI established the Water and Environment division in 1992.  A 1993 edited book presented Palestinian and Israeli perspectives on water cooperation.  Three IPCRI workshops held between 1994-6 on "Our Shared Environment" were followed by three volumes of papers from the workshops.  The IPCRI Water and Environment division took the lead in organizing a 2004 Israeli-Palestinian International "Water for Life" Conference, co-chaired by Israeli and Palestinian professors, held in Turkey, where over five days about 130 participants from the region were joined by about 50 international water experts. 

Subsequently, working with Israeli and Palestinian experts, IPCRI undertook a study of the management of the [[trans-boundary river|trans-boundary]] Nahal Alexander / Wadi Zomer basin.  IPCRI is a partner in the "GLOWA Jordan River" study of the impact of climate change on the Jordan basin, and has undertaken, with the support of the Government of Japan, work designed to provide a model for low cost sanitation to a West Bank village.

===EcoPeace / Friends of the Earth Middle East===
[[Friends of the Earth Middle East|EcoPeace / FoEME]] was founded in 1994 as a meeting place for Palestinian, Egyptian, Jordanian and Israeli environmental NGOs and became an affiliate of Friends of the Earth in 1998.  FOEME has a wide range of projects – organized around particular geographic areas (the Jordan River valley, the Dead Sea, the Gulf of Aqaba / Eilat), water (Good Water Neighbors, the Red Sea-Dead Sea Conduit, the mountain aquifer, "water, peace and the environment," water privatization), and environmental policy (sustainable development, climate change, "violent conflicts and the environment," trade and environment, solar power and healthy food).  FoEME has promoted protection rather than development of the Dead Sea and its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, advocated the establishment of a "peace park" along the Jordan River, and vigorously questioned the proposed mega-project to channel water from the Read Sea to the Dead Sea.  

Since 2001 the FoEME Good Water Neighbors project has been working with Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian communities that are mutually dependent on shared water resources.  Each community is partnered with a neighboring community.  Good Water Neighbors works with local community members on water education, awareness and development.  GWN uses dependence on shared water sources as a basis for dialogue and cooperation between partnered communities.

FoEME has published its own study of environmental peacebuilding,&lt;ref&gt;Harari, N., &amp; Roseman, J. (2008).  Environmental Peacebuilding Theory and Practice: A Case Study of the Good Water Neighbours Project and In Depth Analysis of the Wadi Fukin / Tzur Hadassah Communities. EcoPeace / Friends of the Earth Middle East.&lt;/ref&gt; and circulates a monthly "environmental peacemaking" listserv.

===Arava Institute for Environmental Studies===
The [[Arava Institute for Environmental Studies|institute]] opened in the 1996-7 academic year.  For one or two semesters students from Israel, Jordan, Palestine, Egypt and overseas live and study together on Kibbutz Ketura (in a remote part of the Negev desert south of the West Bank and just across the valley from Jordan) and receive university credit.&lt;ref&gt;Alleson, Ilan and Stuart Schoenfeld.  2007. 	"Environmental Justice and Peacebuilding in the Middle East," Peace Review 19:371-379.&lt;/ref&gt;  Enrolment, which is capped at 45, has varied.  From 1996 to 2010, about 600 students have studied at the institute.  University credit is now received through Ben Gurion University, and the institute co-sponsors a Master's program with Ben Gurion, in which some of its alumni have studied.

The alumni division maintains active Yahoo and Facebook "groups."  Alumni involvement is supplemented by  the Arava Alumni Peace and Environment Network (AAPEN) which held its first meeting in Aqaba in 2005 and has held subsequent meetings and other activities.  The institute has also developed as a research center.  The institute participates in projects as partners with Palestinian and Jordanian researchers and research organizations.  These projects have included developing a center for sustainable agriculture, developing policy options for the Dead Sea, transboundary stream restoration, and a study of health effects from exposure to airborne particles.  These projects involve links to international networks of research funding, and have brought regional conferences to the institute on a regular basis.   The institute has co-sponsored a conference on alternative energy and the supported the development of the solar power oriented Arava Power Corporation.

'''Fungal biochemical tests''' are tests performed to identify [[fungus|fungi]].

The following are some systems currently being used for the identification of [[yeast]]s:
*'''Carbohydrate fermentation''' studies: This tests whether a certain yeast [[fermentation (biochemistry)|ferment]]s different [[carbohydrate]]s.
*'''Carbohydrate assimilation''' studies: This tests whether a yeast can [[Aerobic_respiration|aerobically]] utilize different carbon and nitrogen compounds with oxygen as their final electron acceptor. 
*'''API 20C System''': Freeze-dried [[sugar]]s are placed into wells on a plastic strip, yeast basal medium suspended yeast is [[pipette]]d into wells, and incubated. [[Turbidity]] determines growth.
*'''Uni-Yeast Tek System''': Identifies yeasts based on their ability to ferment certain sugars

'''Helen Singer Kaplan''' (February 6, 1929 – August 17, 1995) was an [[Austrian-American]] [[sex therapist]] and the founder of the first clinic in the United States for [[sexual disorder]]s established at a [[medical school]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Kaplan as someone who was "considered a leader among scientific-oriented sex therapists. She was noted for her efforts to combine some of the insights and techniques of psychoanalysis with behavioral methods."&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2010-03-05 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/19/obituaries/dr-helen-kaplan-66-dies-pioneer-in-sex-therapy-field.html |title=Dr. Helen Kaplan, 66, Dies; Pioneer in Sex Therapy Field |work=The New York Times |date=1995-08-19 |author=Saxon, Wolfgang }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also dubbed the "Sex Queen" because of her role as a pioneer in sex therapy during the [[sexual revolution in 1960s America]], and because of her advocacy of the idea that people should enjoy [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] as much as possible, as opposed to seeing it as something dirty or harmful. The main purpose of her dissertation is to evaluate the psychosexual dysfunctions because these syndromes are among the most prevalent, worrying and distressing medical complaints of modern times.&lt;ref name=pa /&gt;

==Life==
Kaplan was born in [[Vienna]], [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]], on February 6, 1929. In 1940, she emigrated to The United States, becoming a citizen in 1947. She received a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] from [[Syracuse University]] in 1951, graduating ''[[magna cum laude]]''. She was then educated at [[Columbia University]], where she received a [[master's degree]] in [[psychology]] in 1952, and then a [[PhD]] in psychology in 1955. At [[New York Medical College]], she earned a [[Doctor of Medicine|medical degree]] in 1959, and later completed a comprehensive course in [[psychoanalysis]] there in 1970. In 1964, she initiated a unique residency program for women MDs with children at New York Medical College, the "mother's program" enabled residents to be free during vacations and emergencies to care for their children.&lt;ref&gt;Medical World News, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; She was a long-time professor of psychiatry at [[Weill Cornell Medical College]] and the [[Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic]]. She died of cancer at the age of 66.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; At the time of her death, she was married to [[Toys "R" Us]] founder [[Charles Lazarus]].

==Sex research and therapy==
A psychologist and psychiatrist by training, Kaplan viewed [[Sexual arousal|human sexual response]] as a triphasic phenomenon, consisting of separate—but interlocking—phases: desire, arousal, and orgasm.&lt;ref name=MJK&gt;William H. Masters, Virginia E. Johnson, and Robert C. Kolodny, ''Human Sexuality'', 2nd ed.  Little, Brown, &amp; Co., Boston, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  She concluded that "desire" phase disorders are the most difficult to treat, being associated with deep-seated psychological difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;H. Kaplan, ''Disorders of Sexual Desire''.  Brunner/Mazel, New York, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaplan wrote extensively on the treatment of sexual dysfunctions, integrating other methods with principles of psychotherapy.&lt;ref name=MJK /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.S. Kaplan, ''The Illustrated Manual of Sex Therapy''.  Quadrangle/New York Times, New York, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;  As did many other experts in her field, Kaplan believed that sexual difficulties typically had superficial origins.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; She suggested that premature ejaculation occurred if the subject did not have voluntary control over when he ejaculated, and that coitally anorgasmic women should not necessarily be thought of as having a problem.&lt;ref&gt;H.S. Kaplan, ''The New Sex Therapy''.  Brunner/Mazel, New York, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaplan always encouraged people to enjoy having sex as much as possible. However, since the [[HIV/AIDS in the United States|epidemic of AIDS into the United States]] from 1981 into the 1990s, she has had to add the caveat: "If you aren't extremely careful, it can kill you." Kaplan commented that she "absolutely hate[s] having to say that. [...] I have spent my whole life devising solutions to people's problems, telling them that sex is not dirty or harmful, but a natural function. And now I have to tell them, 'Hey, look out. You could die.'"&lt;ref name=pa&gt;{{cite news |title=Warning Women About AIDS for Years |work=The Philadelphia Inquirer |date=1987-11-08 |author=Hacker, Kathy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of her disciples are [[Ruth Westheimer]] and [[Hans-Werner Gessmann]] (in 1976, who added to sex therapy his own humanistic psychological and [[hypnosis]] approaches).

'''HASA''' (highly accelerated stress audit) is a proven test method developed to find [[manufacturing]]/[[production (economics)|production]] process induced defects in [[electronics]] and electro-mechanical assemblies before those products are released to market. HASA is a form of HASS – a powerful testing tool for improving product reliability, reducing warranty costs and increasing customer satisfaction.

Since HASS levels are more aggressive than conventional screening tools, a POS procedure is used to establish the effectiveness in revealing production induced defects. A POS is vital to determine that the HASS stresses are capable of revealing production defects, but not so extreme as to remove significant life from the test item. Instituting HASS to screen the product is an excellent tool to maintain a high level of robustness and it will reduce the test time required to screen a product resulting in long term savings. Ongoing HASS screening assures that any weak [[Electronic component|components]] or manufacturing process degradations are quickly detected and corrected. HASS is not intended to be a rigid process that has an endpoint. It is a dynamic process that may need modification or adjustment over the life of the product.

HASS aids in the detection of early life failures. HASA's primary purpose is to monitor manufacturing and prevent any defects from being introduced during the process. A carefully determined HASA sampling plan must be designed that will quickly signal when process quality has been degraded.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38402">The '''history of herbalism''' is closely tied with the [[history of medicine]] from prehistoric times up until the development of the [[germ theory of disease]] in the 19th century. Modern medicine from the 19th century to today has been based on [[evidence]] gathered using the [[scientific method]]. Evidence-based use of [[pharmaceutical drug]]s, often derived from [[medicinal plant]]s, has largely replaced herbal treatments in modern health care. However, many people continue to employ various forms of [[traditional medicine|traditional]] or [[alternative medicine]]. These systems often have a significant herbal component. The history of [[herbalism]] also overlaps with [[food history]], as many of the herbs and spices historically used by humans to season food yield useful medicinal compounds,&lt;ref name="tapsell"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Tapsell LC, Hemphill I, Cobiac L, etal |title=Health benefits of herbs and spices: the past, the present, the future |journal=Med.

==Prehistory==
The use of plants as medicines predates written human history. [[Archaeological]] evidence indicates that humans were using medicinal plants during the [[Paleolithic]], approximately 60,000 years ago. (Furthermore, other non-human [[primates]] are also known to ingest medicinal plants to treat illness)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sumner, Judith|title=The Natural History of Medicinal Plants|publisher=Timber Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88192-483-0|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant samples gathered from prehistoric burial sites have been thought to support the claim that Paleolithic peoples had knowledge of herbal medicine. For instance, a 60,000-year-old Neanderthal burial site, "[[Shanidar Cave#Shanidar 4.2C the .22flower burial.22|Shanidar IV]]", in northern Iraq has yielded large amounts of pollen from 8 plant species, 7 of which are used now as herbal remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Solecki, Ralph S.|title=Shanidar IV, a Neanderthal Flower Burial in Northern Iraq|work=Science|volume=190|issue=4217|date=November 1975|pages=880–881|doi = 10.1126/science.190.4217.880|bibcode=1975Sci...190..880S}}).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently [[Paul B. Pettitt]] has written that "A recent examination of the microfauna from the strata into which the grave was cut suggests that the pollen was deposited by the burrowing rodent Meriones tersicus, which is common in the Shanidar microfauna and whose burrowing activity can be observed today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pettitt |first=Paul B. |date=2002 |title=The Neanderthal Dead, exploring mortuary variability in middle paleolithic eurasia. |url=http://arheo.ffzg.unizg.hr/ska/tekstovi/neanderthal_dead.pdf |journal=Before Farming |publisher= |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=19 note 8 |doi= |access-date=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medicinal herbs were found in the personal effects of ''[[Ötzi the Iceman]]'', whose body was frozen in the [[Ötztal Alps]] for more than 5,000 years. These herbs appear to have been used to treat the parasites found in his intestines.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Ancient history==
[[File:PEbers c41-bc.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ebers Papyrus]] (c. 1550 BCE) from [[ancient Egypt]] has a prescription for ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'' (marijuana) applied topically for [[inflammation]].]]

=== Mesopotamia ===
In [[Mesopotamia]], the written study of herbs dates back over 5,000 years to the [[Sumer]]ians, who created clay tablets with lists of hundreds of medicinal plants (such as [[myrrh]] and [[opium]]).&lt;ref name="Sumner-2000-p17"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sumner, Judith|title=The Natural History of Medicinal Plants|publisher=Timber Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88192-483-0|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient Egypt ===
Ancient Egyptian texts are of particular interest due to the language and translation controversies that accompany texts from this era and region. These differences in conclusions stem from the lack of complete knowledge of the Egyptian language: many translations are composed of mere approximations between Egyptian and modern ideas, and there can never be complete certainty of meaning or context.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ancient Egyptian Medicine|last = Nunn|first = J.F|publisher = University of Oklahoma Press|year = 1996|isbn = 978-0-8061-2831-3|location = Norman|pages = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; While physical documents are scarce, texts such as the [[Ebers Papyrus|Papyrus Ebers]] serve to illuminate and relieve some of the conjecture surrounding ancient herbal practices. The Papyrus consists of lists of ailments and their treatments, ranging from "disease of the limbs" to "diseases of the skin"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=THE |url=http://www.macalester.edu/~cuffel/ebers.htm |date=2005-02-26 |accessdate=2015-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050226100008/http://www.macalester.edu/~cuffel/ebers.htm |archivedate=February 26, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has information on over 850 plant medicines, including [[garlic]], [[juniper]], [[cannabis]], [[castor bean]], [[aloe]], and [[mandrake (plant)|mandrake]].&lt;ref name="Sumner-2000-p17" /&gt; Treatments were mainly aimed at ridding the patient of the most prevalent symptoms because the symptoms were largely regarded as the disease itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Medical Features of the Papyrus Ebers|last = Von Klein|first = Carl H.|publisher = Press of the American Medical Association|year = 1905|isbn = |location = Chicago|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of the collection and preparation of such remedies are mostly unknown, as many of the texts available for translation assume the physician already has some knowledge of how treatments are conducted and therefore such techniques would not need restating.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though modern understanding of Egyptian [[herbal]]s stem form the translation of ancient texts, there is no doubt that trade and politics carried the Egyptian tradition to regions across the world, influencing and evolving many cultures medical practices and allowing for a glimpse into the world of ancient Egyptian medicine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Herbs used by Egyptian healers were mostly indigenous in origin, although some were imported from other regions like Lebanon. Other than papyri, evidence of herbal medicine has also been found in tomb illustrations or jars containing traces of herbs.&lt;ref name="aem"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nunn|first=John|title=Ancient Egyptian Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WHfEnVU6z8IC&amp;pg=PA227|year=2002|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3504-5|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
In India, [[Ayurveda]] medicine has used many herbs such as [[turmeric]] possibly as early as 4,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Veterinary Herbal Medicine|page=60|author1=Susan G.

=== China ===
In China, seeds likely used for herbalism have been found in the archaeological sites of [[Bronze Age]] China dating from the [[Shang Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hong |first=Francis |title=History of Medicine in China |journal=McGill Journal of Medicine |year=2004 |volume=8 |issue=1 |page=7984 |url=http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/MJM/issues/v08n01/crossroads/hong.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201231218/http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/MJM/issues/v08n01/crossroads/hong.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mythological Chinese emperor [[Shennong]] is said to have written the first [[Chinese herbology|Chinese pharmacopoeia]], the "[[Shennong Ben Cao Jing]]". The "Shennong Ben Cao Jing" lists 365 medicinal plants and their uses - including [[Ephedra]] (the shrub that introduced the drug [[ephedrine]] to modern medicine), [[hemp]], and [[chaulmoogra]] (one of the first effective treatments for leprosy).&lt;ref name="Sumner-2000-p18"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sumner, Judith|title=The Natural History of Medicinal Plants|publisher=Timber Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88192-483-0|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Succeeding generations augmented on the ''Shennong Bencao Jing'', as in the ''[[Yaoxing Lun]]'' (''Treatise on the Nature of Medicinal Herbs''), a 7th-century [[Tang Dynasty]] treatise on herbal medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wu, Jing-Nuan|title=An Illustrated Chinese Materia Medica|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780195140170|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H9Q8agQrJR0C&amp;pg=PA6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient Greece and Rome ===

==== Hippocrates ====
The ''[[Hippocratic Corpus]]'' serves as a collection of texts that are associated with the 'Father of Western Medicine', [[Hippocrates|Hippocrates of Kos]]. Though the actual authorship of some of these texts is disputed, each reflects the general ideals put forth by Hippocrates and his followers. The recipes and remedies included in parts of the ''Corpus'' no doubt reveal popular and prevalent treatments of the early ancient Greek period.

Though any of the herbals included in the ''Corpus'' are similar to those practiced in the religious sectors of healing, they differ strikingly in the lack of rites, prayers, or chants used in the application of remedies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hippocratic Recipes: Oral and Written Transmission of Pharmacological Knowledge in Fifth and Fourth Century Greece|last = Totelin|first = Laurence M.V|publisher = Brill|year = 2009|isbn = 978-90-474-2486-4 |location = Leiden and Boston|pages = 125}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction is truly indicative of the Hippocratic preference for logic and reason within the practices of medicine.

The ingredients mentioned in the ''Corpus'' consist of a myriad of herbs, both local to Greece and imported from exotic locales such as Arabia. While many imported goods would have been too expensive for common household use, some of the suggested ingredients include the more common and cheaper [[Sambucus|elderberries]] and [[Hypericum perforatum|St. John's Wort]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Galen ====
[[Galen|Galen of Pergamon]], a Greek physician practicing in Rome, was certainly prolific in his attempt to write down his knowledge on all things medical – and in his pursuit, he wrote many texts regarding herbs and their properties, most notably his ''[[Galenic corpus|Works of Therapeutics]]''. In this text, Galen outlines the merging of each discipline within medicine that combine to restore health and prevent disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Cambridge Companion to Galen|last = Hankinson|first = R.J|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-139-82691-4|location = Cambridge|pages = |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ygBactKUkAMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter = Therapeutics- Van Der Eijk}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the subject of therapeutics encompasses a wide array of topics, Galen's extensive work in the [[humors]] and four basic qualities helped pharmacists to better calibrate their remedies for the individual person and their unique symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Cambridge Companion to Galen|last = Hankinson|first = R.J|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2008|isbn = 9781139826914|location = Cambridge|pages = |url = https://books.google.com/?id=ygBactKUkAMC&amp;pg=PT414&amp;lpg=PT414&amp;dq=sabine+vogt+companion+to+galen#v=onepage&amp;q=sabine%20vogt%20companion%20to%20galen&amp;f=false|chapter = Drugs and Pharmacology- Vogt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Diocles of Carystus ====
The writings of [[Diocles of Carystus]] were also extensive and prolific in nature. With enough prestige to be referred to as "the second Hippocrates", his advice in herbalism and treatment was to be taken seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2181272|title = Diocles of Carystus: A New Pupil of Aristotle|last = Jaeger|first = Werner|date = July 1, 1940|journal = The Philosophical Review|doi = 10.2307/2181272|pmid =|volume=49|pages=393–414}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the original texts no longer exist, many medical scholars throughout the ages have quoted Diocles rather extensively, and it is in these fragments that we gain knowledge of his writings.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Diocles of Carystus: A Collection of the Fragments with Translation and Commentary|last = Eijk|first = Philip J|publisher = Brill|year = 2000|isbn = 978-90-04-10265-1|location = |pages = vii|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tHc5MOlMbzkC}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is purported that Diocles actually wrote the first comprehensive herbal- this work then cited numerous times by contemporaries such as Galen, [[Celsus]], and [[Soranus of Ephesus|Soranus]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Pliny ====
In what is one of the first encyclopedic texts, [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' serves as a comprehensive guide to nature and also presents an extensive catalog of herbs valuable in medicine.  With over 900 drugs and plants listed, Pliny's writings provide a very large knowledge base upon which we may learn more about ancient herbalism and medical practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Natural History|last = The Elder|first = Pliny|publisher = W. Heinemann|year = 1938|isbn = |location = London|pages = |last2 = Rackham|first2 = Harris|url = https://archive.org/details/naturalhistory03plinuoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny himself referred to ailments as "the greatest of all the operations of nature," and the act of treatment via drugs as impacting the "state of peace or of war which exists between the various departments of nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Natural History of Pliny|last = The Elder|first = Pliny|publisher = H.G.

==== Dioscordes ====
Much like Pliny, [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] constructed a pharmacopeia, ''[[De Materia Medica]]'', consisting of over 1000 medicines produced form herbs, minerals, and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Materia Medica, Pharamcy, Pharmacology, and Therapeutics|last = Hale-White|first = William|publisher = J. and A.

Similarly important for herbalists and botanists of later centuries was [[Theophrastus]]' ''Historia Plantarum'', written in the 4th century BC, which was the first systematization of the botanical world.&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Theophrastus|volume=27|page=787 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="philobio11"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grene|first=Marjorie|title=The philosophy of biology: an episodic history|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-64380-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TJSGJjh8Jo8C&amp;pg=PA11|page=11|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==
{{further|Medicine in the medieval Islamic world}}

While there are certainly texts from the medieval period that denote the uses of herbs, there has been a long-standing debate between scholars as to the actual motivations and understandings that underline the creation of [[herbal]] documents during the medieval period.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 230791 |title = Anglo-Saxon Plant Remedies and the Anglo-Saxons |last = Voigts |first = Linda E. |date = June 1, 1979 |journal = Isis |issue = 2 |volume = 70 |pages = 255, 252, 254|doi=10.1086/352199}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first point of view dictates that the information presented in these medieval texts were merely copied from their classical equivalents without much thought or understanding.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The second viewpoint, which is gaining traction among modern scholars, states that herbals were copied for actual use and backed by genuine understanding.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Some evidence for the suggestion that [[herbal]]s were utilized with knowledgeable intent, was the addition of several chapters of plants, lists of symptoms, habitat information, and plant synonyms added to texts such as the ''[[Herbarium vivum|Herbarium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = Medieval Herbal Remedies: the Old English Herbarium and Anglo-Saxon Medicine |last = Van Arsdall|first = Anne |publisher = Psychology Press |year = 2002|isbn = |location = New York |pages = 119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable texts utilized in this time period include [[Bald's Leechbook]], the [[Lacnunga]], the peri didaxeon, [[Pseudo-Apuleius|Herbarium Apulei]], Da Taxone, and Madicina de Quadrupedidus, while the most popular during this time period were the Ex Herbis Femininis, the Herbarius, and works by [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides]].

[[Benedictine monasteries]] were the primary source of medical knowledge in [[Europe]] and [[England]] during the [[Early Middle Ages]]. However, most of these monastic scholars' efforts were focused on translating and copying ancient Greco-Roman and Arabic works, rather than creating substantial new information and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Arsdall, Anne V. |title=Medieval Herbal Remedies: The Old English Herbarium and Anglo-Saxon Medicine |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2002 |isbn=9780415938495 |pages=70–71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ITxsaqEmVHAC&amp;pg=PA70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mills, Frank A. |chapter=Botany |editor=Johnston, William M. |title=Encyclopedia of Monasticism: M-Z |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2000 |isbn=9781579580902 |page=179 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GfC0TDkJJNgC&amp;pg=PA179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Greek and Roman writings on medicine, as on other subjects, were preserved by  hand copying of manuscripts in monasteries. The monasteries thus tended to become local centers of medical knowledge, and their [[herb garden]]s provided the raw materials for simple treatment of common disorders. At the same time, folk medicine in the home and village continued uninterrupted, supporting numerous wandering and settled herbalists. Among these were the "wise-women" and "wise men", who prescribed herbal remedies often along with spells, enchantments, divination and advice. It was not until the [[late Middle Ages]] that women and men who were knowledgeable in herb lore became the targets of the witch hysteria. One of the most famous women in the herbal tradition was [[Hildegard of Bingen]].  A 12th-century Benedictine nun, she wrote a medical text called ''Causae et Curae''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ramos-e-Silva Marcia | year = 1999 | title = Saint Hildegard Von Bingen (1098–1179)  "The Light Of Her People And Of Her Time" | journal = International Journal of Dermatology | volume = 38 | issue = 4| pages = 315–320 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-4362.1999.00617.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Truitt Elly R | year = 2009 | title = The Virtues Of Balm In Late Medieval Literature| journal = Early Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 6| pages = 711–736 | doi=10.1163/138374209x12542104913966| url = http://repository.brynmawr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&amp;context=history_pubs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were three major sources of information on healing at the time including the Arabian School, Anglo-Saxon leechcraft, and Salerno. A great scholar of the Arabian School was [[Avicenna]], who wrote ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' which became the standard medical reference work of the Arab world. "''The Canon of Medicine'' is known for its introduction of systematic experimentation and the study of physiology, the discovery of contagious diseases and sexually transmitted diseases, the introduction of quarantine to limit the spread of infectious diseases, the introduction of experimental medicine, clinical trials, and the idea of a syndrome in the diagnosis of specific diseases. ...''The Canon'' includes a description of some 760 medicinal plants and the medicine that could be derived from them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = A History of Herbalism for Herbalists, Part 1: How the Arabs Saved Greek Sciences|url = https://www.planetherbs.com/case-studies/a-history-of-herbalism-for-herbalists-part-1-how-the-arabs-saved-greek-sciences.html|website = www.planetherbs.com|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Leechcraft, though bringing to mind part of their treatments, leech was the English term for medical practitioner.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Salerno was a famous school in Italy centered around health and medicine. A student of the school was [[Constantine the African]], credited with bringing Arab medicine to Europe.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Translation of herbals==

During the Middle Ages, the study of plants began to be based on critical observations. "In the 16th and 17th century an interest in [[botany]] revived in Europe and spread to America by way of European conquest and colonization."&lt;ref name="Moore, R. 1998"&gt;Moore, R. (1998). Botany (2nd ed.). New York: WCB/McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers started to act as herbalists and academic professors studied plants with great depth. [[Herbalism|Herbalists]] began to explore the use of plants for both medicinal purposes and agricultural uses. [[Botany|Botanists]] in the Middle Ages were known as herbalists; they collected, grew, dried, stored, and sketched plants. Many became experts in identifying and describing plants according to their morphology and habitats, as well as their usefulness. These books, called [[herbal]]s included beautiful drawings and paintings of plants as well as their uses.

At that time both botany and the art of gardening stressed the utility of plants for man; the popular herbal, described the medical uses of plants.&lt;ref name="Moore, R. 1998"/&gt; During the Middle Ages, there was an expansion of book culture that spread through the medieval world. The phenomenon of translation is well-documented, from its beginnings as a scholarly endeavor in Baghdad as early as the eighth century to its expansion throughout European Mediterranean centers of scholarship by the eleventh and twelfth centuries.&lt;ref name="Hoffman, E. R. 2012"&gt;Hoffman, E. R. (2012). Translating Image and Text in the Medieval Mediterranean World between the Tenth and Thirteenth Centuries. Medieval Encounters, 18(4/5), 584–623. {{doi|10.1163/15700674-12342120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of translation is collaborative effort, requiring a variety of people to translate and add to them. However, how the Middle Ages viewed nature seems to be a mystery.

Translation of text and image has provided numerous versions and compilations of individual manuscripts from diverse sources, old and new. Translation is a dynamic process as well as a scholarly endeavor that contributed great to science in the Middle Ages; the process naturally entailed continuous revisions and additions.&lt;ref name="Hoffman, E. R. 2012"/&gt; The Benedictine monasteries were known for their in-depth knowledge of herbals. These gardens grew the herbs which were considered to be useful for the treatment of the various human ills; the beginnings of modern medical education can be connected with monastic influence.&lt;ref name="Krebs R. Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments 2004"&gt;Krebs R. Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, And Discoveries Of The Middle Ages And The Renaissance [e-book].

Retrieved April 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Monastic academies were developed and monks were taught how to translate Greek manuscripts into Latin.

Knowledge of medieval botanicals was closely related to medicine because the plant's principal use was for remedies.&lt;ref name="Lindberg, D. C. 2007"&gt;Lindberg, D. C. (2007). The beginnings of Western science: the European scientific tradition in philosophical, religious, and institutional context, 600 B.C. to A.D. 1450. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Herbals were structured by the names of the plants, identifying features, medicinal parts of plant, therapeutic properties, and some included instructions on how to prepare and use them. For medical use of herbals to be effective, a manual was developed. Dioscorides' ''De material medica'' was a significant herbal designed for practical purposes.&lt;ref name="Lindberg, D. C. 2007"/&gt;

Theophrastus wrote more than 200 papers describing the characteristics of over 500 plants. He developed a classification system for plants based on their morphology such as their form and structure.&lt;ref name="Krebs R. Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments 2004"/&gt;  He described in detail pepper, cinnamon, bananas, asparagus, and cotton. Two of his best-known works, ''Enquiry into Plants'' and ''The Causes of Plants'', have survived for many centuries and were translated into Latin. He has been referred to as the "grandfather of botany".&lt;ref name="Krebs R. Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments 2004"/&gt; Crateuas was the first to produce a pharmacological book for medicinal plants, and his book influenced medicine for many centuries.&lt;ref name="Krebs R. Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments 2004"/&gt; A Greek physician, Pedanius Dioscorides described over 600 different kinds of plants and describes their useful qualities for herbal medicine, and his illustrations were used for pharmacology and medicine as late as the Renaissance years.

Monasteries established themselves as centers for medical care. Information on these herbals and how to use them was passed on from monks to monks, as well as their patients.&lt;ref name="Arsdall, A. 2002"&gt;Arsdall, A. (2002). Medieval herbal remedies: the Old English herbarium and Anglo-Saxon medicine. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; These illustrations were of no use to everyday individuals; they were intended to be complex and for people with prior knowledge and understanding of herbal. The usefulness of these herbals have been questioned because they appear to be unrealistic and several plants are depicted claiming to cure the same condition, as “the modern world does not like such impression."&lt;ref name="Arsdall, A. 2002"/&gt; When used by experienced healers, these plants can provide their many uses. For these medieval healers, no direction was needed their background allowed them to choose proper plants to use for a variety of medical conditions. The monk's purpose was to collect and organize text to make them useful in their monasteries. Medieval monks took many remedies from classical works and adapted them to their own needs as well as local needs. This may be why none of the collections of remedies we have presently agrees fully with another.&lt;ref name="Arsdall, A. 2002"/&gt;

Another form of translation was oral transmission; this was used to pass medical knowledge from generation to generation. A common misconception is that one can know early medieval medicine simply by identifying texts, but it is difficult to compose a clear understanding of herbals without prior knowledge.&lt;ref name="Arsdall, A. 2002"/&gt; There are many factors that played in influenced in the translation of these herbals, the act of writing or illustrating was just a small piece of the puzzle, these remedies stems from many previous translations the incorporated knowledge from a variety of influences.

==Early modern era==
{{expand section|date=July 2012}}
The 16th and 17th centuries were the great age of [[herbal]]s, many of them available for the first time in English and other languages rather than Latin or Greek. The 18th and 19th centuries saw more incorporation of plants found in the Americas, but also the advance of modern medicine.

===16th century===

The first herbal to be published in English was the anonymous ''[[Grete Herball]]'' of 1526. The two best-known herbals in English were ''The Herball or General History of Plants'' (1597) by [[John Gerard]] and ''The English Physician Enlarged'' (1653) by [[Nicholas Culpeper]]. Gerard’s text was basically a pirated translation of a book by the Belgian herbalist [[Rembert Dodoens|Dodoens]] and his illustrations came from a German botanical work. The original edition contained many errors due to faulty matching of the two parts. Culpepper’s blend of traditional medicine with astrology, magic, and folklore was ridiculed by the physicians of his day, yet his book - like Gerard’s and other herbals - enjoyed phenomenal popularity.  The [[Age of Exploration]] and the [[Columbian Exchange]] introduced new medicinal plants to Europe. The ''Badianus Manuscript'' was an illustrated [[Mexico|Mexican]] herbal written in [[Nahuatl]] and [[Latin]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gimmel Millie | year = 2008 | title = Reading Medicine In The Codex De La Cruz Badiano | url = | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 69 | issue = 2| pages = 169–192 | doi=10.1353/jhi.2008.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===

The [[2nd millennium|second millennium]], however, also saw the beginning of a slow erosion of the pre-eminent position held by plants as sources of therapeutic effects. This began with the [[Black Death]], which the then dominant Four Element medical system proved powerless to stop. A century later, [[Paracelsus]] introduced the use of active chemical [[drug]]s (like [[arsenic]], [[copper sulfate]], [[iron]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[sulfur]]).

===18th century===

In the Americas, herbals were relied upon for most medical knowledge with physicians being few and far between. These books included almanacs, Dodoens' ''New Herbal, Edinburgh New Dispensatory,'' Buchan's ''Domestic Medicine,'' and other works.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Herbal Medicine: The Medical Botany of John Bartram|url = http://www.healthy.net/Health/Article/The_Medical_Botany_of_John_Bartram/861|website = www.healthy.net|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from European knowledge on American plants, Native Americans shared some of their knowledge with colonists, but most of these records were not written and compiled until the 19th century. [[John Bartram]] was a botanist that studied the remedies that Native Americans would share and often included bits of knowledge of these plants in printed almanacs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===19th century===

The formalization of [[pharmacology]] in the 19th century led to greater understanding of the specific actions drugs have on the body. At that time, Samuel Thompson was an uneducated but well respected herbalist who influenced professional opinions so much that Doctors and Herbalists would refer to themselves as Thompsonians. They distinguished themselves from "regular" doctors of the time who used calomel and bloodletting, and led to a brief renewal of the empirical method in herbal medicine.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = History of herbology, herbalism {{!}} RMHI|url = http://www.rmhiherbal.org/aa/f-ahr1-hist.html#renaiss|website = www.rmhiherbal.org|accessdate = 2015-12-08|language = en-US|first = Roger W. Wicke,|last = Ph.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern era ==
Traditional herbalism has been regarded as a method of alternative medicine in the United States since the [[Flexner Report]] of 1910 led to the closing of the [[Eclectic medicine|eclectic medical schools]] where botanical medicine was exclusively practiced. In China, [[Mao Zedong]] reintroduced [[Traditional Chinese medicine|Traditional Chinese Medicine]], which relied heavily on herbalism, into the health care system in 1949. Since then, schools have been training thousands of practitioners – including Americans – in the basics of Chinese medicines to be used in hospitals.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; "The Chinese pharmacopeia is 5000 years old and contains substances that are transformed into effective but non-toxic medicines."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Films On Demand - Login|url = http://digital.films.com/PortalViewVideo.aspx?xtid=35707|website = digital.films.com|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Britain in the 1930s was experiencing turbulence over the practice of herbalism, in the United States, government regulation began to prohibit the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The vicissitudes of herbalism in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Britain.|journal = Medical History|date = 1985-01-01|issn = 0025-7273|pmc = 1139482|pmid = 3883085|pages = 71–92|volume = 29|issue = 1|first = P S|last = Brown|doi=10.1017/s0025727300043751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The World Health Organization estimated that 80% of people worldwide rely on herbal medicines for some part of their primary health care. In Germany, about 600 to 700 plant based medicines are available and are prescribed by some 70% of German physicians."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Herbal medicine|url = https://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/treatment/herbal-medicine|website = University of Maryland Medical Center|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; South African doctors use herbs to treat many patients, some patients finding the plants more useful than modern medicine previously prescribed to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Films On Demand - Login|url = http://digital.films.com/PortalViewVideo.aspx?xtid=53563|website = digital.films.com|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of prescribing treatments and cures to patients requires a legal medical license in the United States of America, and the licensing of these professions occurs on a state level. "There is currently no licensing or certification for herbalists in any state that precludes the rights of anyone to use, dispense, or recommend herbs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Legal and Regulatory FAQs|url = http://www.americanherbalistsguild.com/legal-and-regulatory-faqs|website = American Herbalists Guild|accessdate = 2015-12-01|first = Mimi|last = Hernandez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Traditional medicine is a complex network of interaction of both ideas and practices, the study of which requires a multidisciplinary approach."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Herbal Medicine in Yemen : Traditional Knowledge and Practice, and Their Value for Today's World|url = http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/ebookviewer/ebook/ZTAwMHhuYV9fNDgwODEyX19BTg2?sid=86371e57-605e-4582-98a5-6e37a26959a9@sessionmgr115&amp;vid=0&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=1|website = web.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many alternative physicians in the 21st century incorporate herbalism in traditional medicine due to the diverse abilities plants have and their low number of side effects.

'''Information and communication technologies for environmental sustainability''' ('''ICT Ensure''') or Green ICT as per the  International Federation of Global &amp; Green ICT "IFGICT" is a general term referring to the application of [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICTs) within the field of [[environmental sustainability]]. Information and communication technologies are acting as integrating and enabling technologies for the economy and they profoundly affect our society. Recent changes in ICT use globally have damaged the environment (in terms of waste and energy consumption etc.) but also have the potential to support environmental sustainability activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Murugesan | first1 = S. | last2 = Laplante | first2 = P.

New technologies provide utilities for knowledge acquisition and awareness, early evaluation of new knowledge, reaching agreements and communication of progress in the interest of the [[Quality of life|human welfare]]. This includes ethical aspects of protecting human life as well as aspects of consumer safety and the preservation of our [[natural environment]].

==Application areas==
More and more application areas are becoming relevant to sustainable development in industry, [[health care]], [[agriculture]] and the [[information society]], and they affect the perspectives of ICT, the environment, policy and science. More and more interest has been emerged as well to [[risk management|risk]] and [[disaster management]], adaptation to [[climate change]] and resource use.

'''Linked timestamping''' is a type of [[trusted timestamping]] where issued time-stamps are related to each other.

==Description==
Linked timestamping creates time-stamp tokens which are dependent on each other, entangled in some [[authenticated]] [[data structure]]. Later modification of the issued time-stamps would invalidate this structure. The temporal order of issued time-stamps is also protected by this data structure, making backdating of the issued time-stamps impossible, even by the issuing server itself.

The top of the authenticated data structure is generally ''published'' in some hard-to-modify and widely witnessed media, like printed [[newspaper]] or public [[blockchain]]. There are no (long-term) [[Public-key cryptography|private keys]] in use, avoiding [[Public key infrastructure|PKI]]-related risks.

Suitable candidates for the authenticated data structure include:
* Linear [[hash chain]]
* [[Merkle tree]] (binary hash tree)
* [[Skip list]]

The simplest linear hash chain-based time-stamping scheme is illustrated in the following diagram:
[[File:Hashlink timestamping.svg|none|600px]]

The linking-based [[Timestamping authority|time-stamping authority]] (TSA) usually performs the following distinct functions:

;Aggregation
:For increased scalability the TSA might group time-stamping requests together which arrive within a short time-frame. These requests are ''aggregated'' together without retaining their temporal order and then assigned the same time value. Aggregation creates a [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] connection between all involved requests; the authenticating aggregate value will be used as input for the ''linking'' operation.

;Linking
:Linking creates a verifiable and ordered cryptographic link between the current and already issued time-stamp tokens.

[[File:Root of Merkle tree as published in Widely Witnessed Media.png|thumb|321px|right|Example newspaper publication of hash-linked time-stamping service]]

;Publishing
:The TSA periodically ''publishes'' some links, so that all previously issued time-stamp tokens depend on the published link and that it is practically impossible to forge the published values. By publishing widely witnessed links, the TSA creates unforgeable verification points for validating all previously issued time-stamps.

==Security==
Linked timestamping is inherently more secure than the usual, public-key signature based time-stamping. All consequential time-stamps "seal" previously issued ones - hash chain (or other authenticated dictionary in use) could be built only in one way; modifying issued time-stamps is nearly as hard as finding a preimage for the used [[cryptographic hash function]]. Continuity of operation is observable by users; periodic publications in widely witnessed media provide extra transparency.

Tampering with absolute time values could be detected by users, whose time-stamps are relatively comparable by system design.

Absence of secret keys increases system trustworthiness. There are no keys to leak and hash algorithms are considered more future-proof&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-88702-7_3| isbn = 978-3-540-88701-0| title = Post-Quantum Cryptography| year = 2009| last1 = Buchmann | first1 = J.| chapter = Hash-based Digital Signature Schemes| last2 = Dahmen | first2 = E.| last3 = Szydlo | first3 = M.| pages = 35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; than modular arithmetic based algorithms, e.g. [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]].

Linked timestamping scales well - hashing is much faster than public key cryptography. There is no need for specific cryptographic hardware with its limitations.

The common technology&lt;ref&gt;See ISO/IEC 18014-1:2002 Chapter 4.2&lt;/ref&gt; for guaranteeing long-term attestation value of the issued time-stamps (and digitally signed data&lt;ref&gt;For example see [[XAdES|XAdES-A]].&lt;/ref&gt;) is periodic over-time-stamping of the time-stamp token. Because of missing key-related risks and of the plausible safety margin of the reasonably chosen hash function this over-time-stamping period of hash-linked token could be an order of magnitude longer than of public-key signed token.

===Foundations===

Haber and Stornetta proposed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00196791 | title = How to time-stamp a digital document | year = 1991 | last1 = Haber | first1 = S. | issue = 2 | last2 = Stornetta | first2 = W. S. | journal = Journal of Cryptology | volume = 3| url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/old/haber91how.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1990 to link issued time-stamps together into linear hash-chain, using a collision-resistant hash function. The main rationale was to diminish [[Timestamping authority|TSA]] trust requirements.

Tree-like schemes and operating in rounds were proposed by Benaloh and de Mare in 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Benaloh and de Mare constructed a one-way accumulator&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| doi = 10.1007/3-540-48285-7_24| isbn = 978-3-540-57600-6| title = Advances in Cryptology — EUROCRYPT '93| year = 1994| last1 = Benaloh| chapter = One-Way Accumulators: A Decentralized Alternative to Digital Signatures | first1 = J.| last2 = Mare | first2 = M.| volume = 765| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science| pages = 274| url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/old/benaloh94oneway.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1994 and proposed its use in time-stamping. When used for aggregation, one-way accumulator requires only one constant-time computation for round membership verification.

Surety&lt;ref&gt;http://www.surety.com/&lt;/ref&gt; started the first commercial linked timestamping service in January 1995. Linking scheme is described and its security is analyzed in the following article&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1145/266420.266430 | isbn = 0897919122 | title = Proceedings of the 4th ACM conference on Computer and communications security  - CCS '97 | year = 1997 | last1 = Haber | chapter = Secure names for bit-strings | first1 = S. | last2 = Stornetta | first2 = W.

Skip-list based time-stamping system was implemented in 2005; related algorithms are quite efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| doi = 10.1007/11751595_43| isbn = 978-3-540-34075-1| title = Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2006| year = 2006| last1 = Blibech| chapter = A New Timestamping Scheme Based on Skip Lists | first1 = K.| last2 = Gabillon | first2 = A.| volume = 3982| pages = 395| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Sciencef}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provable security===

Security proof for hash-function based time-stamping schemes was presented by Buldas, Saarepera&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
| last = Buldas
| first = Ahto
| last2 = Saarepera
| first2 = Märt
| title = On Provably Secure Time-Stamping Schemes
| pages = 500–514
| journal = LNCS
| volume = 3329
| year = 2004
| url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.65.8638
| doi = 10.1007/b104116}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004. There is an explicit upper bound &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; for the number of time stamps issued during the aggregation period; it is suggested that it is probably impossible to prove the security without this explicit bound - the so-called black-box reductions will fail in this task. Considering that all known practically relevant and efficient security proofs are black-box, this negative result is quite strong.

Next, in 2005 it was shown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buldas|first1=A.|last2=Laud|first2=P.|last3=Saarepera|first3=M. R.|last4=Willemson|first4=J.|date=|year=2005|title=Universally Composable Time-Stamping Schemes with Audit.|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.59.2070|journal=LNCS|volume=3650|pages=359–373|doi=10.1007/11556992+26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that bounded time-stamping schemes with a trusted audit party (who periodically reviews the list of all time-stamps issued during an aggregation period) can be made ''universally composable'' - they remain secure in arbitrary environments (compositions with other protocols and other instances of the time-stamping protocol itself).

Buldas, Laur showed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-71677-8_11 | isbn = 978-3-540-71676-1 | title = Knowledge-Binding Commitments with Applications in Time-Stamping | year = 2007 | last1 = Buldas | first1 = A.| last2 = Laur | first2 = S.| journal = LNCS| volume = 4450 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | pages = 150–165| url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.102.2680}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007 that bounded time-stamping schemes are secure in a very strong sense - they satisfy the so-called "knowledge-binding" condition. The security guarantee offered by Buldas, Saarepera in 2004 is improved by diminishing the security loss coefficient from &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

The hash functions used in the secure time-stamping schemes do not necessarily have to be collision-resistant&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-75670-5_9 | isbn = 978-3-540-75669-9 | title = Does Secure Time-Stamping Imply Collision-Free Hash Functions? | year = 2007 | last1 = Buldas | first1 = A.| last2 = Jürgenson | first2 = A.| journal = LNCS| volume = 4784 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | pages = 138–150| url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.110.4564}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even one-way;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/11767480_4 | isbn = 978-3-540-34703-3 | title = Do Broken Hash Functions Affect the Security of Time-Stamping Schemes? | year = 2006 | last1 = Buldas | first1 = A.| last2 = Laur | first2 = S.| journal = LNCS| volume = 3989 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | pages = 50–65| url = http://www.cs.ut.ee/~swen/publications/articles/buldas-laur-2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; secure time-stamping schemes are probably possible even in the presence of a universal collision-finding algorithm (i.e. universal and attacking program that is able to find collisions for any hash function). This suggests that it is possible to find even stronger proofs based on some other properties of the hash functions.

[[File:Hashtree timestamping.svg|thumb|none|600px|Hash tree based linking scheme]]
At the illustration above hash tree based time-stamping system works in rounds (&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t+1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t+2&lt;/math&gt;, ...), with one aggregation tree per round. Capacity of the system (&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;) is determined by the tree size (&lt;math&gt;N=2^l&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; denotes binary tree depth). Current security proofs work on the assumption that there is a hard limit of the aggregation tree size, possibly enforced by the subtree length restriction.

==Standards==
[[ISO 18014]] part 3 covers 'Mechanisms producing linked tokens'.

[[American National Standards Institute|American National Standard]] for Financial Services, "Trusted Timestamp Management and Security" ([[ANSI ASC X9.95 Standard]]) from June 2005 covers linking-based and hybrid time-stamping schemes.

There is no [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] [[Request for Comments|RFC]] or standard draft about linking based time-stamping. RFC 4998 (Evidence Record Syntax) encompasses hash tree and time-stamp as an integrity guarantee for long-term archiving.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7043">This is an incomplete list of [[plants]] with trifoliate leaves. '''Trifoliate''' leaves (also known as '''trifoliolate''' or '''ternate''' leaves) are a [[leaf shape]] characterized by a leaf divided into three leaflets. Species which are known to be trifoliate are listed here. Genera which are characteristically trifoliate are also listed, with species underneath. Genera which are generally ''not'' trifoliate are not listed; only the trifoliate species are. Entries are currently listed in alphabetical order, but in the future it may be desirable to list them by families. It may also be desirable to include common names and references.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3690">The '''Mathematical Optimization Society''' ('''MOS'''), known as the '''Mathematical Programming Society''' until 2010,&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.mathprog.org/?nav=mps_namechange The Mathematical Optimization Society was known as the '''Mathematical Programming Society''' (MPS) until 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214154115/http://www.mathprog.org/?nav=mps_namechange |date=2011-02-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; is an international association of researchers active in  [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. The MOS encourages the research, development, and use of optimization—including [[mathematics|mathematical theory]], [[:Category:Mathematical optimization software|software implementation]], and [[operations research|practical applications (operations research)]].

Founded in 1973, the MOS has several activities: Publishing journals and a newsletter, organizing and cosponsoring conferences, and awarding prizes.

== History ==
In the 1960s, [[Optimization (mathematics)|mathematical programming]] methods were gaining increasing importance both in mathematical theory and in industrial application. To provide a discussion forum for researchers in the field arose, the journal ''Mathematical Programming'' was founded in 1970. 

Based on activities by [[George B. Dantzig|George Dantzig]], [[Albert W. Tucker|Albert Tucker]], [[Philip Wolfe (mathematician)|Philip Wolfe]] and others, the MOS was founded in 1973, with George Dantzig as its first president.

== Activities ==
=== Conferences ===
Several conferences are organized or co-organized by the Mathematical Optimization Society, for instance:
* The ''International Symposium on Mathematical Programming (ISMP)'', organized every three years, is open to all fields of mathematical programming.
* The ''Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization (IPCO)'' conference, in [[Integer programming]], is held in those years when there is no ISMP.
* The ''International Conference on Continuous Optimization (ICCOPT)'', the continuous analog of the IPCO conference, was first held in 2004.
* The ''International Conference on Stochastic Programming (ICSP)'' takes place every three years and is devoted to optimization using uncertain input data.
* The ''Nordic MOS'' conference is a biannual meeting of researchers from [[Scandinavia]] working in all fields of optimization.
* At the [[Université de Montréal]], annual seminars on changing topics are organized by the MOS.

=== Journals and other publications ===
There are several publications by the Mathematical Optimization Society:
* The journal ''[[Mathematical Programming]]'' (series A/B): series A publishes articles from all fields of optimization; each issue of series B is devoted to a particular subject.
* The journal ''Mathematical Programming Computation'' 
* ''Optima'', the newsletter of the MOS, contains articles on optimization, conference information and book reviews.
* ''MPS/SIAM Series on Optimization'' is a series of books that is jointly  published by the MOS (formerly MPS) and the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] (SIAM). It has published [[monograph]]s, [[textbook]]s, books collecting applications of optimization, and [[tutorial]]s.

=== Prizes ===
The MOS awards prizes in the field of optimization, including the [[Fulkerson Prize]], the [[Dantzig Prize]] and the [[Tucker Prize]].

[[Preservation (library and archival science)|Preservation]] of documents, pictures, recordings, digital content, etc., is a major aspect of [[archival science]]. It is also an important consideration for people who are creating [[time capsule]]s, [[family history]], [[historical document]]s, [[scrapbooking|scrapbooks]] and [[family tree]]s. Common storage media are not permanent, and there are few reliable methods of preserving documents and pictures for the future.

==Paper/prints (photos)==
{{Main|Photograph preservation}}

Color [[Negative (photography)|negatives]] and ordinary color [[Photographic printing|prints]] may fade away to nothing in a relatively short period if not stored and handled properly. This happens even if the negatives and prints are kept in the dark, because ambient light is not the determining factor, but heat and humidity are. The color degradation is the result of the dyes used in the color processes. Because [[Color photography|color processing]] results in a less stable image than traditional [[black-and-white]] processing, black-and-white pictures from the 1920s are more likely to survive long-term than color films and photographs from after the middle 20th century.

Black-and-white photographic films using [[silver halide]] emulsions are the only film types that have proven to last for archival storage. The determining factors for longevity include the film base type, proper processing (develop, stop, fix and wash) and proper storage. Early films were coated onto a nitrate base material which was prone to combustion if stored in uncontrolled temperatures. [[Nitrate film]] was replaced with acetate-base films. These [[Cellulose acetate film]]s were later discovered to outgass acids (also referred to as vinegar syndrome). Acetate films were replaced in the early 1980s by [[polyester]] film base materials which have been determined to be more stable than nitrate- and acetate-base films.

Color prints made on most [[inkjet printer]]s look very good at first but they have a very short lifespan, measured in months rather than in years. Even prints from commercial photo labs will start to fade in a matter of years if not processed properly and stored in cool, dry environments.

==Documents/books==
With documents for which the media are not so critical as what the documents contain, the information in documents can be copied by using [[photocopier]]s and [[image scanner]]s. Books and manuscripts can also have their information saved without destruction by using a [[Book scanning|book scanner]].

Where the medium itself needs to be preserved, for example if a document is a crayon sketch by a famous artist on paper, a complex process of preservation may be used. Depending on the condition and importance of the item this can include gluing the media onto more stable media, or protective enclosing of the media. [[Polyester]] sleeves, [[Acid-free paper|acid-free]] folders, and pH buffered document boxes are common supportive protective enclosures whose selection must match the media’s chemical and physical properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/paper.html | title =Care, Handling, and Storage of Works on Paper| work = Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other considerations in preserving paper/books are:
* Damaging light, particularly [[UV]] light, which fades and destroys media over time by breaking down the molecules.
* Atmosphere contains small traces of [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[nitric acid]] which turn media yellow and break the fibers down.
* Humidity and moisture also aid in the breakdown of media. If there is too much, the document can be attacked by bacteria, and if too little, [[cellulose]] material breaks down.
* Temperature, particularly elevated ones, can destroy some media. Low temperatures can cause the water to form crystals which expands destroying the structure of paper-based documents.

==Online photo albums==
Although there are many websites that allow the [[image hosting service|upload of photographs]] and [[video hosting service|videos]], [[digital preservation]] for the long-term is still an issue.  There is a lack of confidence that such websites are capable of storing data for long periods of time (ex. 50 years) without data degradation or loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Webster |first=John |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-21546_3-10309283-10253464.html |title=How long is long-term storage? &amp;#124; Data-driven - CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Optical media - CD, DVD==
Optical media, such as [[CD]]s and [[DVD]]s, contain an organic dye that distinguishes data reading from data writing based on the dye’s transparency along the disk.&lt;ref name="LOC"&gt;Library of Congress, "NIST/LC: Optical Disc Longevity Study,"	https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rt/NIST_LC_OpticalDiscLongevity.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Conventional CDs and DVDs have finite shelf-life due to natural degradation of the dye; the newer [[M-DISC]] uses different technology to produce DVDs with a claimed lifespan of up to 1000 years. The [[National Archives and Records Administration]] lists published life expectancies to be 10 or 25 years or more for normal [[CD]]s and [[DVD]]s and conservative life expectancies to be between 2 and 5 years.&lt;ref name ="NARA"&gt;National Archives and Records Administration, "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about Optical Storage Media: Storing Temporary Records on CDs and DVDs, National Archives,"	https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/initiatives/temp-opmedia-faq.html&lt;/ref&gt; Storage environments, such as temperature and humidity, as well as handling conditions such as frequency of media use and compatibility between the recorder and media, affect media shelf-life.&lt;ref name = "UKOLN"&gt;UKOLN, "Digital Archaeology: Rescuing Neglected and Damaged Data Resources,"	http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/services/elib/papers/supporting/pdf/old-p2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements in media storage and migrations to new recording technologies can make certain formats obsolete within their respective lifespan. Technologists have pointed to internet [[streaming media]], where services such as [[video-on-demand]] have contributed to the 33 percent decline in [[DVD]] sales the past 5 years, as a challenge for [[digital preservation]].&lt;ref name="DownfallOfDVD"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything |last=Saylor |first=Michael |year=2012 |publisher=Perseus Books/Vanguard Press |page=86 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Magnetic media - video cassettes, tapes, hard drives==
[[magnetic tape|Magnetic media]] such as [[audio tape|audio]] and [[videotape|video]] tape and [[Floppy disk|floppy disks]] also have limited life spans.

Audio and video tapes require specific care and handling to ensure that the recorded information will be preserved. For information that must be preserved indefinitely, periodic transcription from old media to new ones is necessary, not only because the media are unstable but also because the recording technology may become obsolete.

[[File:Molded VHS tape.jpg|thumb|A badly molded [[VHS]] tape. Mold can grow due to humidity on the storage space, and then prevent modern usage.]]

[[magnetic tape|Magnetic media]] also deteriorates naturally with typical shelf lives between 10 and 20 years.&lt;ref name ="Broadway Video"&gt;Broadway Video Digital Media, "Causes and Measurement of Videotape Decay," http://sportsvideo.org/main/files/2010/08/video-tape-white-paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Magnetic tape can degrade from binder hydrolysis or magnetic remanence decay. Binder hydrolysis, also known as [[sticky-shed syndrome]], refers to the breakdown of binder, or glue, that holds the magnetic particles to the polyester base of the tape. Tapes which have been stored in hot, humid conditions are particularly vulnerable to this phenomenon and may suffer from accelerated degradation. Severe binder can cause the magnetic material to fall off or sheds from the base, leaving a pile of dust and clear backing. [[Archivist]]s can [[Tape baking|bake the tape]], which evaporates water molecules on the tape, to temporarily restore the binder before making a copy.

[[Magnetic tape]] can also be destabilized by magnetic [[Data remanence|remanence]] decay, which refers to the weakening of the tape’s magnetization over time. This weakens the affect tape’s readability, leading to reduced sound clarity and volume or picture hue and contrast. Baking the tape will not restore magnetization. [[Archivist]]s might instead digitally encode a copy of the tape, preserving its content as a digital data file.

Media at risk include recorded media such as [[Master recording|master]] audio recordings of symphonies and videotape recordings of the news gathered over the last 40 years. Threats to media that must be considered when archiving important record media include accidental erasure, physical loss due to disasters such as fires and floods, and media degradation.

Along with the actual media being degraded over the years, the machines that are available to play back or reproduce the audio sources are becoming archaic themselves. Manufacturers and their support (parts, technical updates) for their machines have disappeared throughout the years. Even if the medium is vaulted and archived correctly, the mechanical properties of the machines have deteriorated to the point that they could do more harm than good to the tape being played.

Many major film studios are now backing up their libraries by converting them to electronic media files, such as .[[AIFF]] or .[[WAV]]-based files via digital audio workstations. That way, even if the digital platform manufacturer goes out of business or no longer supports their product, the files can still be played on any common computer.

There is a detailed process that must take place previous to the final archival product now that a digital solution is in place. Sample rates and their conversion and reference speed are both critical in this process.

In floppy disks, the lubricants inside the plastic jackets of many older floppies promote the decay of the magnetic medium. Also, the alignment of the magnetic particles of the disk substrate may gradually degrade, leading to a loss of formatting and data. Early laser disk media were prone to degradation as the layers of the disk substrate were bonded with an adhesive that was vulnerable to decay and would crumble over time. This would lead the different layers of the disk to peel apart, damaging the pitted data surface and rendering the disk unreadable.

'''''Myths to Live By''''' is a 1972 book, a collection of essays, originally given as lectures at the [[Cooper Union]] Forum, by [[mythologist]] [[Joseph Campbell]] between 1958 and 1971. The work has an introduction by Johnson E. Fairchild.

The deep power of [[mythology|myth]] on the inner, spiritual lives of human beings throughout the ages (including our own age) is the common theme running throughout all of the essays in the collection. Campbell explains the differences between western and oriental myths and rites. He shows how fundamental universal thoughts are adapted to local requirements of legitimation. A typical form of adaptation of the ''hero'' is the American image of the ''lone rider'' who dispels evil.&lt;ref&gt;Edition London 1985, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology''', also known as NIMBB, is a research institute of the [[University of the Philippines]]. It has four branches which are located in [[UP Diliman]] (NIMBB-Diliman), [[UP Los Baños]] (BIOTECH-UPLB), [[UP Manila]] (National Institutes of Health-IMBB/BIOTECH-UP Manila) and [[UP Visayas]] (NIMBB-UP Visayas/BIOTECH-UP Visayas).

BIOTECH laboratories are accredited and recognized by Environmental Management Bureau, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Bureau of Food and Drugs, Department of Health, and Bureau of Animal Industry.

==Research and Extension Programs==

Research and Extension at BIOTECH covers five main areas:

===Agriculture and Forest Biotechnology===
The [[Agriculture]] and [[Forestry]] [[Biotechnology]] Program is the country's incubator of agribiotechnology researches on biofertilizers, microbial biodiversity for reforestation and agricultural waste treatment.

===Biotechnology Program for Food, Feeds and Specialty Products===
[[File:Uplb biotech bldg.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Headquarters of the National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology in Los Baños, Laguna]]
BIOTECH discovers and upgrades technologies to produce high value foods, feeds, additives, specialty products, and develops efficient detection kits to ensure quality and safety. The program explores sources, properties and application of [[functional food]]s such as nutraceuticals, probiotics from GRAS Lactic Acid Bacteria and yeast.

Nutraceuticals are the functional foods such as omega-3, 6 and polyunsaturated fatty acids from structured lipids like coconut and local seed oil. The institute also intensifies improvement, application and commercialization of existing [[DNA]]-based detection kits and industrial [[enzymes]].

===Bioinformatics and Drug Discovery Program===
Bioinformatics and Drug Discovery Program applies modern and conventional scientific techniques to discover pharmaceutically-important compounds produced from local isolates and to develop plant cell culture systems as a source of high-value secondary metabolites (drugs). The program uses bioinformatics, computational software, and tissue culture technology for the identification and mass production of identified novel compounds. Continuing efforts are exerted to promote and commercialize BioVac-HS and BioVac-FC, the vaccines against Pasteurella multocida which causes fatal hemorrhagic septicemia and fowl cholera, respectively.

===Industrial and Environmental Biotechnology===
Industrial and Environmental Biotechnology searches for cost-effective and renewable fuel sources to help lessen the impact of oil price increases. The program focuses on the discovery and development of robust microorganisms to improve biofuel production. It also develops biological binders or biosurfactant,biopolymers,and heat-resistant enzymes,for wastes degradation and bioremediation.

===Communication and Technology Utilization===
Communication and Technology Utilization Program packages BIOTECH information and facilitates its proactive exchange among the scientists-researchers and Institute clients. The program also embarks on various technology transfer and commercialization approaches. Among its services include biotechnology promotion, training and internship, product and technology marketing, database management and communication support services.

==Facilities and Services==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Uplb biotech lab.jpg|thumb|150px|left|A laboratory at BIOTECH]] --&gt;

===Philippine National Collection of Microorganisms (PNCM)===

'''Nominal identity''' is the [[identity (disambiguation)|identity]] in name only as opposed to the individual experience of that identity. The concept is often used in sociology, psychology and linguistics.

==Social sciences==
Nominal identity is the name to which one identifies, or calls oneself (i.e. general "African American," "Irish," "Straight," "Gay," "Female," "Male"). Whereas '''virtual identity''' is the experience of that identity, "The latter is, in a sense, what the name means; this is primarily a matter of its consequences for those who bear it, and can change while the nominal identity remains the same (and vice versa)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first= Richard |title=Rethinking Ethnicity: Arguments and Explorations |publisher=Sage Publications LTD |year=2001 |location=London, UK |page=72 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qoOj0SSrQrYC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=definition+of+%22nominal+identity%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZnfdIAETQH&amp;sig=MWuGxzYHP_0uU-gENR0_tEDEP4I&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gz6dS_KYIML38AbCl5icDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=definition%20of%20%22nominal%20identity%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those who self-identify as "gay," the term may not confer the same experience for two people or even between various geographical or cultural regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first=Richard |title=Social Identity |publisher=Routledge |year=2008 |location=Oxon, UK |page=100 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRIe8YaaBIIC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=definition+of+%22nominal+identity%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YVpKCmNEHi&amp;sig=fVvb72cDaQCPAQMvWP3fK97xUZo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gz6dS_KYIML38AbCl5icDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, while one may talk about a "chair," "chair" itself can entail many forms, from arm chair to ladder back to even tree stump, if the experience of "chair" is something upon which a person sits.

[[Pierre Bourdieu]] uses the term nominal identity in ''[[Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste]]'' to mean both that which the identity of a subject is named and also where identity is an insignificant measurement or representation of the "perceived reality" of a subject or phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bourdieu |first=Pierre |authorlink= Pierre Bourdieu |author2=Translated by Richard Nice  |title=Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1984 |location= Cambridge, MA |page=18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVaS6gS9Jz4C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=bourdieu+%22nominal+identity+of+the+%27indicators%27&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bourdieu |first=Pierre |authorlink=Pierre Bourdieu |author2=Translated by Richard Nice  |title=Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1984 |location=Cambridge, MA |page=194 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVaS6gS9Jz4C&amp;pg=PA194&amp;dq=bourdieu+%22nominal+identity+%28that%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; To further clarify, for Bourdieu nominal identity can often mean "face value" or "appearance." He often mentions the term nominal identity in order to illustrate the idea of a more complex reality, beyond the name, within the studied subject.

===Nominal identity in ethnicity===
Ethnic identity is a "social identity arising through group formation, individual identification with a group, and interaction between different ethnic groups."&lt;ref name="wrong"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Categorically Wrong? Nominal versus Graded Measures of Ethnic Identity |journal=Linguistics and Philosophy |date=2000-09-01 |first=Henry E. |last=Brady |author2=Cynthia S. Kaplan  |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=56–91 |doi=10.1007/BF02699766 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/lf5autv45gqym5we/ |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry E. Brady and Cynthia S. Kaplan compiled a study called "Categorically Wrong? Nominal versus Graded Measures of Ethnic Identity" that takes a look at ethnicity as a nominal identity. Their study proposed whether or not "the attitudes of members of the group with the more salient identity can be completely explained by its nominal identity while the attitudes of the members of the group with less salient identity require a graded measure of ethnicity."&lt;ref name="wrong"/&gt;

Brady and Kaplan focused on the country Estonia, where they posited two groups: "Estonians," and one that they call the "Slavs," a collective group of Russians, Ukrainians, or Belarusians. They chose this geographical area in particular because of the "centrality of ethnicity in the politics of transition in the USSR."&lt;ref name="wrong"/&gt; media usage (such as television, radio, or newspaper, whether it was the Estonia language Republic television or Russian-language media), individuals who identify themselves with another nationality, and the language used at home.

Brady and Kaplan concluded that "ethnicity is not always a nominal characteristic"&lt;ref name="wrong"/&gt; for these two groups in Estonia. It is only nominal when most salient. "Ethnic identity ... causes individuals within a group to form their attitudes based upon their nominal identity".&lt;ref name="wrong"/&gt; Individuals may generalize themselves in a certain category such as their nationality, but when it comes down to variables of different degrees in formulating their ethnicity, it is no longer nominal. It is their way of dividing themselves from a generalized name.

==Linguistics==
Nominal identity in [[linguistics]] pertains to the identity of a word or group of words functioning as a noun or an adjective within a sentence's structure. Specifically, it relates to how one can look at a sentence and propose a different understanding of that sentence through the analysis of its identity defined in its lexical construct, such as in the example used by Chris Barker&lt;ref name="Barker"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Squibs and Discussion: Individuation and Quantification. |journal=Linguistic Inquiry |date=Fall 1999 |first=Chris |last= Barker |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=683–691 |url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/002438999554264 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-03-23 |doi=10.1162/002438999554264}}&lt;/ref&gt; when discussing one of [[Manfred Krifka]]'s study "Four thousand ships passed through the lock: Object-induced measure functions on events":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Four thousand ships passed through the lock: Object-induced measure functions on events |journal=Linguistics and Philosophy |year=1990 |first=Manfred |last=Krifka |volume=13 |pages=487–520 |url= http://semantics.uchicago.edu/kennedy/classes/s07/events/krifka90.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-03-23 |doi=10.1007/bf00627291}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(1) Four thousand ships passed through the lock last year."&lt;ref name="Barker"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the surface, the proposition suggests that 4,000 distinct ships passed through the lock last year. However, as Krifka points out in his study, one could say that there were fewer than 4,000 distinct ships and that some of those ships passed through the lock more than once. Individuals reading this sentence could argue about the interpretation of this sentence. The outcome could be many interpretations when looking at the sentence more closely and determining what variables were taken into consideration when making this statement.&lt;ref name="Barker"/&gt;

==Definitions and practices==

===General===
While non-penetrative sex (or outercourse) is usually defined as excluding sexual penetration,&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LaRosa"/&gt; some non-penetrative sex acts can have penetrative components and may therefore be categorized as non-penetrative sex. Oral sex, for example, which can include oral caress of the [[Sex organ|genitalia]], as well as penile penetration of the mouth or oral penetration of the vagina, may be categorized as non-penetrative sex.&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Leary"/&gt; Oral sex may also be considered outercourse solely because it is not [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal]] or [[Anal sex|anal]] intercourse.&lt;ref name="Kalichman"&gt;{{Cite book|authors=Seth C.

The words ''penetration'' and ''penetrative'' may be restricted to penile-vaginal penetration, and, in this way, the definition of outercourse additionally includes penetrative anal sex, with the term ''outercourse'' used to contrast the term ''sexual intercourse'' as vaginal sex.&lt;ref name="Crooks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blonna"&gt;{{Cite book|authors=Richard Blonna, Janice Loschiavo, Dan Watter|title=Health Counseling: A Microskills Approach for Counselors, Educators, and School Nurses| publisher = [[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning]]|year = 2011|accessdate=September 1, 2013|pages =170–171| isbn = 0763781568|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1jyFP945NOIC&amp;pg=PA170|quote=[N]onpenetrative sexual pleasure.

The term ''heavy petting'' covers a broad range of [[foreplay]] activities, typically involving some genital stimulation, but not the direct act of penetrative sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Heavy petting"&gt;{{cite web|title=Heavy petting|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2013|accessdate=September 1, 2013|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/heavy-petting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frottage===
[[File:Wiki-frot1.png|thumb|200px|Frot: two men rubbing their penises together to create sexual sensations]]
''Frottage'' is the general term for the act of rubbing any part of the body, including the buttocks, the breasts, abdomen, thighs, feet, hands, legs and sexual organs against the sexual organ of another person; this is done whether naked or clothed and is more commonly known as ''dry humping'' or ''dry sex''.&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;{{cite journal| last = M.| first = Hodge| authorlink = |author2=Evelyn Blackwood |author3=Jeffrey M.

Couples may engage in frottage as a form of foreplay or simply as a method to achieve sexual gratification without the penetrative aspects of vaginal, anal or oral sex, which may also be their personal way of preserving [[virginity]]&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Intimate"/&gt; or their way of practicing [[safer sex]].&lt;ref name="Durham"/&gt; Often, young people will engage in frottage as an earlier stage of sexual intimacy before their idea of more explicit sexual contact is desired.

Other terms associated with frottage are:
* ''[[Princeton University|Princeton]] rub'', ''[[Ivy League]] rub'', and so on are slang terms referring to male-male [[frot]] or [[intercrural sex]] or both, presumably surviving from the days when these colleges only admitted men.&lt;ref name="Piepenburg"/&gt; [[W.&amp;nbsp;H. Auden]] was proud of having been the first person to use the terms ''Princeton rub'' and ''Princeton first-year'' in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=W.&amp;nbsp;H.

*The term ''frottage'' derives from the [[French language|French]] verb ''frotter'' (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;to rub). Three terms derive from ''frotter''. These include frottage, the sexual act involving rubbing; frot, the sexual act that refers exclusively to male-male genital rubbing without penetration (but may also be referred to as ''frottage'');&lt;ref name="Piepenburg"&gt;{{cite news|first=Erik|last=Piepenburg|title=What's Rub Got to Do With it?|publisher=''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]''|date=February 2006|accessdate=July 4, 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2IEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=frot+weintraub+definition#v=onepage&amp;q=frot%20weintraub%20definition&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perez"&gt;{{cite book | author =Joe Perez|title=Rising Up|isbn=1411691733|publisher=Lulu.com|year=2006|page=248|accessdate=July 4, 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=caJ7gPv0DrAC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Bill%20Weintraub%20anal%20sex&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[frotteurism]], a [[paraphilia]] involving obsession with frottage or performing frottage non-consensually (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;pressing one's genitals against a stranger on a crowded subway); this was once called "frottage," but the usage is no longer acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;''Eccentric and Bizarre Behaviors'', Louis R.

===Mutual masturbation===
&lt;!--NOTE: Mutual masturbation redirects to this section; changing this heading will affect that redirect.--&gt;

[[Image:Geiger-masturbation-mutuelle.jpg|thumb|right|1840 [[Johann Nepomuk Geiger]] depiction of mutual masturbation]]
Mutual [[masturbation]] (also called manual intercourse) usually involves the manual stimulation of genitals by two or more people who stimulate themselves or one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fulbright|first=Yvonne K.|title=The Better Sex Guide to Extraordinary Lovemaking|year=2010|publisher=Quiver|isbn=9781592333523|page=141|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mPVEEWaKK1UC&amp;pg=PA141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richters"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richters | first1 = J. | last2 = Song | first2 = A. | year = 1999 | title = Australian university students agree with Clinton's definition of sex | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 318 | issue = 7189| page = 1011 | doi=10.1136/bmj.318.7189.1011a}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be done in situations where the participants do not feel ready, physically able, socially at liberty, or willing to engage in any penetrative sex act, or a particular penetrative sex act, but still wish to engage in a mutual sexual activity. It is also done as part of a full repertoire of sexual activity, where it may be used as foreplay,&lt;ref name="Richters"/&gt; while, for others, it is the primary sexual activity of choice.

Types of mutual masturbation include the [[handjob]] (the manual sexual stimulation of the [[Human penis|penis]] or [[scrotum]] by a person on a male)&lt;ref name="Handjob"&gt;{{cite web|title=Handjob|publisher=[[Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary]]|year=2013|accessdate=September 1, 2013|url=http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/handjob}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]] (the manual sexual stimulation of the [[vagina]], [[clitoris]] or other parts of the [[vulva]], by a person on a female). Sexual stimulation of the genitals by using the feet may also be included, and so may manual stimulation of the [[Human anus|anus]].&lt;ref name="Richters2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richters | first1 = J. | last2 = Hendry | first2 = O. | last3 = Kippax | first3 = S. | year = 2003 | title = When safe sex isn't safe | url = | journal = Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 37–52 | doi=10.1080/713804637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like frottage in general, mutual masturbation may be used as an alternative to penile-vaginal penetration, to preserve virginity or to prevent pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Intimate"/&gt; It might result in one or more of the partners achieving [[orgasm]]. If no bodily fluids are exchanged (as is common), mutual masturbation is a form of safe sex, and greatly reduces the risk of transmission of sexual diseases.&lt;ref name="Durham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aids.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;

In partnered manual genital stroking to reach orgasm or expanded orgasm, both people focus on creating and experiencing an orgasm in one person. Typically, one person lies down pant-less, while his or her partner sits alongside. The partner who is sitting uses his or her hands and fingers (typically with a lubricant) to slowly stroke the penis or clitoris and other genitals of the partner. Expanded orgasm as a mutual masturbation technique reportedly creates orgasm experiences more intense and extensive than what can be described as, or included in the definition of, a regular orgasm.&lt;ref name="ESO"&gt;{{cite book|title=The ESO Ecstasy Program: Better, Safer Sexual Intimacy and Extended Orgasmic Response|author1=Alan Brauer  |author2=Donna Brauer |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Warner Books|year=1991|pages=24–25|quote=Masters in Johnson ... described female orgasm as "a brief episode of physical release" characterized by either "a series of rapidly recurrent orgasmic experiences between which no recordable plateau-phase intervals can be demonstrated or by a single, long-continued orgasmic episode... status orgasmus is may last from 20 to more than 60 seconds"}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a range of sensations that include orgasms that are full-bodied, and orgasms that last from a few minutes to many hours.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Taylor, PhD thesis (2000), In her PhD research study, the average time spent in an EO session was 54 minutes.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this technique is not without risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections, in particular HIV. A person using his or her finger, with a small wound, to stimulate a woman's genitals could be infected with HIV found in her vagina's fluids; likewise regarding a man's semen containing HIV, which could infect a partner who has a small exposed wound on his or her skin.

===Exclusively non-penetrative===

&lt;!--If you don't like the above picture, create/obtain a suitable (i.e., non-hideous) replacement.--&gt;

Non-penetrative sex may sometimes be divided into acts that are exclusively non-penetrative and those that are not.{{By whom|date=June 2017}} Exclusively non-penetrative sexual acts include:

*[[Axillism|Axillary intercourse]]: (slang: "bagpiping", in reference to the underarm manner in which [[bagpipes]] are played; ''directing traffic'', or ''pit-wank'', a variant of the term ''tit-wank'', are also terms for axillary intercourse).

== Hookup culture ==
{{Main|Hookup culture}}In many [[Developed country|developed countries]], there is a trend where young individuals (typically late teens and early twenties) engage in [[casual sex]], also known as a hookup. This phenomenon has been termed ''[[hookup culture]].'' The term ''hookup'' in this context loosely means participating in some type of sexual activity (whether it is non-penetrative or penetrative) with another individual or group of individuals outside of a [[Romance (love)|romantic]] relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnold | first1 = K. D. | year = 2010 | title = College student development and the hook-up culture | url = | journal = Journal of College &amp; Character | volume = 11 | issue = | page = 4 | doi=10.2202/1940-1639.1736}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hooking up may be in the form of a [[one-night stand]], where the sex acts are contained within a single situation or the individuals may "hook up" on a more consistent basis (sometimes known as being "friends with benefits").  In addition, hooking up can mean different things to different people. Some individuals believe a hookup is "anything but intercourse", which would include only non-penetrative sex acts.&lt;ref name="Heldman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heldman | first1 = C. | last2 = Wade | first2 = L. | year = 2010 | title = Hook-up culture: Setting a new research agenda | url = | journal = Sexuality Research and Social Policy | volume = 7 | issue = 4| pages = 323–333 | doi=10.1007/s13178-010-0024-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Birth control]] may not be utilized if the individuals are not planning on engaging in a sex act.

==Health risks==

There is a sociocultural viewpoint that because non-penetrative sex usually does not involve a direct exchange of [[semen]] or [[Vaginal lubrication|vaginal fluids]], and because at no point (in exclusively non-penetrative sex acts) does anything penetrate the vulva, vagina or anus, these acts are risk free. Although the risks associated with non-penetrative sex acts are significantly less than those associated with penetrative sex, there are still risks that can occur.&lt;ref name="Durham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aids.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;  There is a slight risk for pregnancy and [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs) with certain non-penetrative sex acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clutterbuck | first1 = D.

Pregnancy can still occur with anal sex or other forms of sexual activity where the penis is near the vagina (such as intercrural sex or other genital-genital rubbing) where sperm can be deposited near the entrance of the vagina and can travel along the vagina's lubricating fluids; the risk of pregnancy can also occur without the penis being near the vagina because sperm may be transported to the vaginal opening by the vagina coming in contact with fingers or other non-genital body parts that have come in contact with semen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=R.

Like non-exclusive non-penetrative sex acts, STI transmission varies for exclusively non-penetrative sexual activities; some common STIs transmitted through exclusively non-penetrative sex acts, and how they are contracted, are the following:&lt;ref name="plannedparenthood"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/stds-hiv-safer-sex-101.htm|title=STDs :: Planned Parenthood|publisher=plannedparenthood.org|accessdate=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Herpes simplex|Herpes]] can be spread through kissing or anytime an infected mouth or genitals comes into contact with another individual's mouth or genitals (when it occurs on the genitals, it is known as [[Herpes genitalis|genital herpes]])
*[[Genital wart]]s is similar to herpes, but caused by a different virus. It is also spread by skin-to-skin contact with the genitals
*[[Chancroid]] is spread through skin-to-skin contact when an infected individual has sores present and these sores come into contact with another individual (generally in the genital area)
*[[Cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) is spread through coming into contact with various body secretions (saliva, genital excretions, blood etc.)
*[[Human papillomavirus]] (HPV) is spread through skin-to-skin contact
*[[Molluscum contagiosum]] is spread through close contact with an infected person (sharing personal items or close skin-to-skin contact)
*[[Crab louse]] (also known as pubic lice or crabs) can be spread through close contact with an infected person
*[[Scabies]] is spread through close contact with an infected individual
*[[Syphilis]] can be spread through kissing, but is much more likely to be spread through vaginal, anal or oral intercourse
*[[Trichomoniasis]] (Trich) can be spread through sharing [[sex toy]]s, during mutual masturbation or any time genital fluid are passed from one person to another

With regard to non-exclusive non-penetrative sex acts, the risks somewhat increase because there is penetration (either of the vagina, anus or mouth) and there is the potential for bodily fluids (semen, vaginal secretions, saliva) to be exchanged. In addition to the aforementioned STIs, the following can be transmitted through non-exclusive non-penetrative sex acts:&lt;ref&gt;Choices, N. H. S. (2013). Sex activities and risk-Live Well-NHS Choices. Men's health, 18, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Chlamydia infection|Chlamydia]] is generally spread through vaginal or anal intercourse; in rare cases, it may be spread through oral sex
*[[Gonorrhoea]] is generally spread through vaginal or anal intercourse, though it may also be spread through oral sex
*[[Hepatitis B]] can be spread through oral sex

Many individuals are concerned about the risk of [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt; Generally, a person must either have unprotected sexual intercourse (vaginal or anal), use an infected syringe or have the virus passed from mother to child to be infected.&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;  A person cannot be infected from casual contact, such as hugging; however, there is some risk if HIV-infected blood or genital secretions (semen or vaginal secretions) enter an open wound.&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;

The only way for complete protection from pregnancy or STI risk is to completely [[Sexual abstinence|abstain from all sexual activities]]. However, there are several ways to decrease the risk, should a person decide to be sexually active.

Some barrier methods include:
*[[Condom]]s, which can provide STI protection
*[[Dental dam]]s, which offer STI protection during oral sex
*Latex gloves, which can be used during mutual masturbation or fingering to prevent the risk of STI transmission

If a person is concerned about the minor risk of pregnancy from non-penetrative sex, there are also several [[hormonal contraceptive]] birth control methods that can be used. Dual protection (using both a barrier device and hormonal method) can be significantly effective at preventing both pregnancy and STI transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Reprod Health Matters. 2006 Nov;14(28):162-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Passion''' (Greek ''πασχω'' "to suffer, to be acted on"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/greek/3958.htm|title=3958. paschó|work=Strong's Concordance|accessdate=December 15, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170718232618/http://biblehub.com/greek/3958.htm|archivedate=July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Late Latin (chiefly Christian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/passion|title=Definition of passion|work=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=December 15, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504214510/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/passion|archivedate=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) ''passio'' "passion; suffering" (from Latin ''pati'' "to suffer")) is a feeling of intense enthusiasm towards or compelling desire for someone or something. Passion can range from eager interest in or admiration for an idea, proposal, or cause; to enthusiastic enjoyment of an interest or activity; to strong attraction, excitement, or emotion towards a person. It is particularly used in the context of romance or sexual desire, though it generally implies a deeper or more encompassing emotion than that implied by the term ''[[lust]]''.

[[Denis Diderot]] describes passions as "penchants, inclinations, desires and aversions carried to a certain degree of intensity, combined with an indistinct sensation of pleasure or pain, occasioned or accompanied by some irregular movement of the blood and animal spirits, are what we call passions. They can be so strong as to inhibit all practice of personal freedom, a state in which the soul is in some sense rendered passive; whence the name passions. This inclination or so-called disposition of the soul, is born of the opinion we hold that a great good or a great evil is contained in an object which in and of itself arouses passion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|hdl=2027/spo.did2222.0000.248|title=Passions|first=Denis |last=Diderot|date=1 April 2004|journal=Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d'Alembert - Collaborative Translation Project|volume=12|page=142–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He further breaks down pleasure and pain, which are the guiding principles of passion into four major categories:

# Pleasures and pains of the senses 
# Pleasures of the mind or of the imagination 
# Our perfection or our imperfection of virtues or vices 
# Pleasures and pains in the happiness or misfortunes of others

==Reason==

'''Strong Desire for something:''' 
In whatever context, if someone desires for something and that desire has some strong feeling or emotion is defined in terms of passion. Passion has no boundary, being passionate about something which is boundless can be sometimes dangerous, In which person forget about everything and is fully determined towards the particular thing-'''(Sanyukta)'''

In his wake, [[Stoicism|Stoics]] like [[Epictetus]] emphasized that "the most important and especially pressing field of study is that which has to do with the stronger emotions...sorrows, lamentations, envies...passions which make it impossible for us even to listen to reason".&lt;ref&gt;W. A. Oldfield trans., ''Epitectus: The Discourses Vol II''  (london 1978) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The Stoic tradition still lay behind [[Hamlet]]'s plea to "Give me that man That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him In my heart's core",&lt;ref&gt;Harold Jenkins ed., ''Hamlet'' (London 1995) p. 292&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Erasmus]]'s lament that "Jupiter has bestowed far more passion than reason&amp;nbsp;– you could calculate the ratio as 24 to one".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Goleman, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; It was only with the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] that a valorisation of passion ''over'' reason took hold in the Western tradition: "the more Passion there is, the better the Poetry".&lt;ref&gt;John Dennis, in M. H. Abrams, ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' (Oxford 1953) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent concerns of emotional intelligence have been to find a synthesis of the two forces—something that "turns the old understanding of the tension between reason and feeling on its head: it is not that we want to do away with emotion and put reason in its place, as Erasmus had it, but instead find the intelligent balance of the two".&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, p. 28-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Descartes' Error"===
[[Antonio Damasio]] studied what ensued when something "severed ties between the lower centres of the emotional brain...and the thinking abilities of the [[neocortex]]".&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; He found that while "emotions and feelings can cause havoc in the processes of reasoning...the ''absence'' of emotion and feeling is no less damaging";&lt;ref&gt;Antonio R. Damasio, ''Descartes' Error'' (London 1996) p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; and was led to "the counter-intuitive position that feelings are typically ''indispensable'' for rational decisions".&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The passions, he concluded, "have a say on how the rest of the brain and cognition go about their business. Their influence is immense...[providing] a frame of reference&amp;nbsp;– as opposed to [[Descartes]]' error...the Cartesian idea of a disembodied mind".&lt;ref&gt;Damasio, p. 160 and p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

==In marriage==

A tension or [[dialectic]] between marriage and passion can be traced back in Western society at least as far as the Middle Ages, and the emergence of the cult of [[courtly love]]. [[Denis de Rougemont]] has argued that 'since its origins in the twelfth century, passionate love was constituted in opposition to marriage'.&lt;ref&gt;Denis de Rougement, ''Love in the Western World'' (Princeton 1983) p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stacey Oliker]] writes that while "[[Puritanism]] prepared the ground for a marital love ideology by prescribing love in marriage", only from the eighteenth century has "romantic love ideology resolved the Puritan antagonism between passion and reason"&lt;ref&gt;Stacey J. Oliker, ''Best Friends and Marriage'' (1989) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; in a marital context. (Note though that [[Saint Paul]] spoke of loving one's wife in [[Ephesians]] 5.)

==Intellectual passions==

[[George Bernard Shaw]] "insists that there are passions far more exciting than the physical ones...'intellectual passion, mathematical passion, passion for discovery and exploration: the mightiest of all passions'".&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Weintraub, ''Shaw's People'' (1996) p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; His contemporary, [[Sigmund Freud]], argued for a continuity (not a contrast) between the two, physical and intellectual, and commended the way "[[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]] had energetically sublimated his sexual passions into the passion for independent scientific research".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud: A Life for Our Time'' (London 1989) p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a motivation in an occupation==
There are different reasons individuals are [[Motivation|motivated]] for an [[Job (role)|occupation]]. One of these includes passion for the occupation. When an individual is passionate about their occupation they tend to be less obsessive about their behavior while on their job, resulting in more work being done and more work satisfaction. These same individuals have higher levels of [[psychological]] well-being.&lt;ref name="BurkeFik"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burke|first=R. J.|author2=Fiksenbaum, Lisa|title=Work Motivations, Satisfactions, and Health Among Managers: Passion Versus Addiction|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|date=May 2009|volume=43|pages=349–365|doi=10.1177/1069397109336990|url=http://ccr.sagepub.com/content/43/4/349|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812093750/http://ccr.sagepub.com/content/43/4/349|archivedate=2016-08-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When people genuinely enjoy their profession and are motivated by their passion, they tend to be more satisfied with their work and more psychologically healthy. When individuals are unsatisfied with their profession they tend to also be dissatisfied with their family relationships and experience psychological distress.&lt;ref name="BurkeFik"/&gt; Other reasons people are more satisfied when they are motivated by their passion for their occupation include the effects of intrinsic and external motivations. When an individual is doing the job to satisfy others, they tend to have lower levels of satisfaction and psychological health. Also, these same individuals have shown they are motivated by several beliefs and fears concerning other people.&lt;ref name="BurkeFik"/&gt; Thirdly, though some individuals believe one should not work extreme hours, many prefer it because of how passionate they are about the occupation. On the other hand, this may also put a strain on family relationships and friendships. The balance of the two is something that is hard to achieve and it is always hard to satisfy both parties.

===Work enjoyment vs. inner pressures===
There are different components that qualify as reasons for considering an individual as a [[workaholic]]. Burke &amp; Fiksenbaum refer to Spence and Robbins (1992) by stating two of the three workaholism components that are used to measure workaholism.  These include feeling driven to work because of inner pressure and work enjoyment.  Both of these affect an individual differently and each has different outcomes.  To begin, work enjoyment brings about more positive work outcomes and is unrelated to health indicators. Inner pressure, on the other hand, is negatively related with work outcomes and has been related negatively to measures of psychological health. Burke &amp; Fiksenbaum make a reference to Graves et al. (2006) when examining work enjoyment and inner pressures. Work enjoyment and inner pressure were tested with performance ratings. The former was positively related to performance ratings while the latter interfered with the performance-enhancing aspects of work enjoyment. Burke &amp; Fiksenbaum refer to Virick and Baruch (2007) when explaining how these two workaholism components affect [[life satisfaction]]. Not surprisingly, inner pressure lowered the balance between work-life and life satisfaction but enhanced people's performance at their occupation, whereas work enjoyment led to a positive balance between the two. Again, when individuals are passionate about their occupation and put in many hours, they then become concerned that their occupation will satisfy personal relationships and the balance must then be found according to the importance levels of the individual.&lt;ref name="BurkeFik"/&gt;

====Motivation and outcomes====
The researchers indicate different patterns of correlations between these two components. These patterns include antecedents and consequences. The two components offer unique motivations or orientations to work which result in its effects on work and well-being. Inner pressures will hinder performance while work enjoyment will smooth performance.  Inner pressures of workaholism have characteristics such as persistence, rigidity, perfectionism, and heightened levels of job stress. This component is also associated with working harder, not smarter.  On a more positive note, individuals who enjoy their work will have higher levels of performance for several reasons. These include creativity, trust in their colleagues, and reducing levels of stress.&lt;ref name="BurkeFik"/&gt;

====Good and bad workaholics====
Burke and Fiksenbaum refer to Schaufeli, Taris, and Bakker (2007) when they made a distinction between an individual being a good workaholic and him being a bad workaholic. A good workaholic will score higher on measures of work engagement and a bad workaholic will score higher on measures of burnout. They also suggest why this is – some individuals work because they are satisfied, engaged, and challenged and to prove a point. On the other hand, the opposite kind work hard because they are addicted to work; they see that the occupation makes a contribution to finding an identity and purpose.&lt;ref name="BurkeFik"/&gt;

====Desire in an occupation====
Passion and desire go hand in hand, especially as a motivation. Linstead &amp; Brewis refer to Merriam-Webster to say that passion is an "intense, driving, or overmastering feeling or conviction". This suggests that passion is a very intense emotion, but can be positive or negative. Negatively, it may be unpleasant at times. It could involve pain and has obsessive forms that can destroy the self and even others. In an occupation, when an individual is very passionate about their job, they may be so wrapped up in work that they cause pain to their loved ones by focusing more on their job than on their friendships and relationships. This is a constant battle of balance that is difficult to achieve and only an individual can decide where that line lies. Passion is connected to the concept of desire. In fact, they are inseparable, according to a mostly western way of thinking related to Plato, Aristotle, and Augustine. These two concepts cause individuals to reach out for something, or even someone. They both can either be creative or destructive and this dark side can very well be dangerous to the self or others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Linstead|first=S.|author2=Brewis, J.|title=Passion, Knowledge and Motivation: Ontolgies of Desire|journal=Organization|year=2007|volume=14|series=3|pages=351–371|doi=10.1177/1350508407076149|url=http://org.sagepub.com/content/14/3/351|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210041556/http://org.sagepub.com/content/14/3/351|archivedate=2015-12-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a motivation for hobbies==
[[Hobbies]] require a certain level of passion in order to continue engaging in the hobby. Singers, athletes, dancers, artists, and many others describe their emotion for their hobby as a passion. Although this might be the emotion they're feeling, passion is serving as a motivation for them to continue their hobby. Recently there has been a model to explain different types of passion that contribute to engaging in an activity.

=== Dualistic model ===
According to researchers who have tested this model, "A dualistic model in which passion is defined as a strong inclination or desire toward a self-defining activity that one likes (or even loves), that one finds important (high valuation), and in which one invests time and energy." &lt;ref name="Mediating"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phillipe|first=F.L.|author2=Vallerand, R. J. |author3=Houlfort, N. |author4=Lavigne, G. L. |author5=Donahue, E. G. |title=Passion for an activity and quality of interpersonal relationships: The mediating role of emotions.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2010|volume=98|issue=6|pages=917–932 |doi=10.1037/a0018017 |pmid=20515247}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that there exist two types of passion. The first type of passion is harmonious passion.

"A harmonious passion refers to a strong desire to engage in the activity that remains under the person's control." &lt;ref name="Mediating"/&gt;This is mostly obtained when the person views their activity as part of their [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. Furthermore, once an activity is part of the person's identity then the motivation to continue the specific hobby is even stronger. The harmony obtained with this passion is conceived when the person is able both to freely engage in or to stop the hobby. It's not so much that the person is forced to continue this hobby, but on his or her own [[free will]] is able to engage in it. For example, if a girl loves to play [[volleyball]], but she has a project due the next day and her friends invite her to play, she should be able to say "no" on the basis of her own free will.

The second kind of passion in the dualistic model is ''obsessive passion''. Being the opposite of ''harmonious passion''. This type has a strong desire to engage in the activity, but it's not under the person's own control and he or she is forced to engage in the hobby. This type of passion has a negative effect on a person where they could feel they need to engage in their hobby to continue, for example,  interpersonal relationships, or "fit in" with the crowd. To change the above example, if the girl has an obsessive passion towards volleyball and she is asked to play with her friends, she will likely say "yes" even though she needs to finish her project for the next day.

==== Intrinsic motivation ====
Since passion can be a type of motivation in hobbies then assessing intrinsic motivation is appropriate. Intrinsic motivation helps define these types of passion. Passion naturally helps the needs or desires that motivate a person to some particular action or behavior.&lt;ref name="RobinKeys"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=C.|title=The Keys to Turbo-Charging Intrinsic Motivation|journal=Journal For Quality &amp; Participation|year=2010|volume=33|issue=3|pages=4–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain abilities and hobbies can be developed early and the innate motivation is also something that comes early in life. Although someone might know how to engage in a hobby, this doesn't necessarily mean they are motivated to do it. Christine Robinson makes the point in her article that, " ...knowledge of your innate motivation can help guide action toward what will be fulfilling." &lt;ref name="RobinKeys"/&gt; Feeling satisfied and fulfilled builds the passion for the hobby to continue a person's happiness.

==Fictional examples==

In [[Margaret Drabble]]'s ''[[The Realms of Gold]]'', the hero flies hundreds of miles to reunite with the heroine, only to miss her by 24 hours&amp;nbsp;– leaving the onlookers "wondering what grand passion could have brought him so far...a quixotic look about him, a look of harassed desperation".&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Drabble, ''The Realms of Gold''(Penguin 1977) p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; When the couple ''do'' finally reunite, however, the heroine is less than impressed. "'If you ask me, it was a very ''childish'' gesture. You're not twenty-one now, you know'. 'No, I know. It was my last fling'".&lt;ref&gt;Drabble, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Alberto Moravia]]'s ''1934'', the revolutionary double-agent, faced with the girl he is betraying, "was seized by violent desire...he never took his eyes off my bosom...I believe those two dark spots at the end of my breasts were enough to make him forget tsarism, revolution, political faith, ideology, and betrayal".&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Moravia, ''1934'' (London 1983) p. 128-9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Post-Impressionism''' (also spelled '''Postimpressionism''') is a predominantly French [[art movement]] that developed roughly between 1886 and 1905, from the last Impressionist exhibition to the birth of [[Fauvism]]. Post-Impressionism emerged as a reaction against [[Impressionism|Impressionists']] concern for the naturalistic depiction of light and colour. Due to its broad emphasis on abstract qualities or symbolic content, Post-Impressionism encompasses [[Neo-Impressionism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Cloisonnism]], [[Pont-Aven School]], and [[Synthetism]], along with some later Impressionists' work. The movement was led by [[Paul Cézanne]] (known as father of Post-impressionism), [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], and [[Georges Seurat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/poim/hd_poim.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art Timeline, Post-Impressionism]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Post-Impressionism'' was first used by art critic [[Roger Fry]] in 1906.&lt;ref name="brettell"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=v5TcYXGDeI8C&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22the+term+Post-impressionism%22,+%221906%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIqYXYo8DMAhVLuhQKHROHBYAQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20term%20Post-impressionism%22%2C%20%221906%22&amp;f=false Richard R. Brettell, ''Modern Art, 1851-1929: Capitalism and Representation'', Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 21]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrin et al"&gt;Peter Morrin, Judith Zilczer, William C. Agee, ''The Advent of Modernism. Post-Impressionism and North American Art, 1900-1918'', High Museum of Art, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Frank Rutter]] in a review of the [[Salon d'Automne]] published in ''Art News'', 15 October 1910, described [[Othon Friesz]] as a "post-impressionist leader"; there was also an advert for the show ''The Post-Impressionists of France''.&lt;ref name=bullen&gt;Bullen, J. B. ''Post-impressionists in England'', p.37. Routledge, 1988. {{ISBN|0-415-00216-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-00216-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, Roger Fry used the term again when he organized the 1910 exhibition, ''Manet and the Post-Impressionists'', defining it as the development of French art since [[Édouard Manet|Manet]]. 

Post-Impressionists extended [[Impressionism]] while rejecting its limitations: they continued using vivid colours, often thick application of paint, and real-life subject matter, but were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, distort form for expressive effect, and use unnatural or arbitrary colour.

==Overview==
The Post-Impressionists were dissatisfied with what they felt was the triviality of subject matter and the loss of structure in Impressionist paintings, though they did not agree on the way forward. [[Georges Seurat]] and his followers concerned themselves with [[Pointillism]], the systematic use of tiny dots of colour. [[Paul Cézanne]] set out to restore a sense of order and structure to painting, to "make of Impressionism something solid and durable, like the art of the museums".&lt;ref&gt;Huyghe, Rene: ''Impressionism''. (1973). Secaucus, N.J.: Chartwell Books Inc., p. 222. {{OCLC|153804642}}&lt;/ref&gt; He achieved this by reducing objects to their basic shapes while retaining the saturated colours of Impressionism. The Impressionist [[Camille Pissarro]] experimented with [[Neo-impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] ideas between the mid-1880s and the early 1890s. Discontented with what he referred to as romantic Impressionism, he investigated [[Pointillism]], which he called scientific Impressionism, before returning to a purer [[Impressionism]] in the last decade of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Cogniat, Raymond (1975). Pissarro. New York: Crown, pp. 69–72. {{ISBN|0-517-52477-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vincent van Gogh]] used colour and vibrant swirling brush strokes to convey his feelings and his state of mind.

Although they often exhibited together, Post-Impressionist artists were not in agreement concerning a cohesive movement. Yet, the abstract concerns of harmony and structural arrangement, in the work of all these artists, took precedence over [[Realism (arts)|naturalism]]. Artists such as Seurat adopted a meticulously scientific approach to colour and composition.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10173&amp;section_id=T068997#skipToContent Caroline Boyle-Turner, ''Post-Impressionism, History and application of the term'', MoMA, From Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Younger painters during the early 20th century worked in geographically disparate regions and in various stylistic categories, such as [[Fauvism]] and [[Cubism]], breaking from Post-Impressionism.

The term was used in 1906,&lt;ref name="brettell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrin et al" /&gt; and again in 1910 by [[Roger Fry]] in the title of an exhibition of modern French painters: ''Manet and the Post-Impressionists'', organized by Fry for the [[Grafton Galleries]] in London.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/manetpostimpress00graf  ''Manet and the post-impressionists''; Nov. 8 to Jan. 15, 1910-11, Grafton Galleries, London]&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks before Fry's show, art critic [[Frank Rutter]] had put the term ''Post-Impressionist'' in print in ''Art News'' of 15 October 1910, during a review of the [[Salon d'Automne]], where he described [[Othon Friesz]] as a "post-impressionist leader"; there was also an advert in the journal for the show ''The Post-Impressionists of France''.&lt;ref name=bullen /&gt;

Most of the artists in Fry's exhibition were younger than the Impressionists. Fry later explained: "For purposes of convenience, it was necessary to give these artists a name, and I chose, as being the vaguest and most non-committal, the name of Post-Impressionism. This merely stated their position in time relatively to the Impressionist movement."&lt;ref&gt;Gowing, Lawrence (2005). ''Facts on File Encyclopedia of Art'': 5. New York: Facts on File, p. 804. {{ISBN|0-8160-5802-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Rewald]] limited the scope to the years between 1886 and 1892 in his pioneering publication on ''Post-Impressionism: From Van Gogh to Gauguin'' (1956). Rewald considered this a continuation of his 1946 study, ''History of Impressionism'', and pointed out that a "subsequent volume dedicated to the second half of the post-impressionist period":&lt;ref name="Rewald 1978, p. 9"&gt;Rewald, John: ''Post-Impressionism: From Van Gogh to Gauguin'', revised edition: Secker &amp; Warburg, London, 1978, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Post-Impressionism: From Gauguin to Matisse'', was to follow. This volume would extend the period covered to other artistic movements derived from Impressionism, though confined to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Rewald focused on such outstanding early Post-Impressionists active in France as [[van Gogh]], [[Gauguin]], [[Seurat]], and [[Odilon Redon|Redon]]. He explored their relationships as well as the artistic circles they frequented (or were in opposition to), including:
* [[Neo-Impressionism]]: ridiculed by contemporary art critics as well as artists as [[Pointillism]]; [[Georges-Pierre Seurat|Seurat]] and [[Paul Signac|Signac]] would have preferred other terms: [[Divisionism]] for example
* [[Cloisonnism]]: a short-lived term introduced in 1888 by the art critic [[Édouard Dujardin]], was to promote the work of [[Louis Anquetin]], and was later also applied to contemporary works of his friend [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]]
* [[Synthetism]]: another short-lived term coined in 1889 to distinguish recent works of Gauguin and Bernard from that of more traditional Impressionists exhibiting with them at the [[The Volpini Exhibition, 1889|Café Volpini]].
* [[Pont-Aven School]]: implying little more than that the artists involved had been working for a while in Pont-Aven or elsewhere in Brittany.
* [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]: a term highly welcomed by vanguard critics in 1891, when Gauguin dropped Synthetism as soon as he was acclaimed to be the leader of Symbolism in painting.
Furthermore, in his introduction to Post-Impressionism, Rewald opted for a second volume featuring [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Henri Rousseau]] "le Douanier", [[Les Nabis]] and [[Cézanne]] as well as the [[Fauvism|Fauves]], the young [[Picasso]] and Gauguin's last trip to the [[South Sea Islands|South Seas]]; it was to expand the period covered at least into the first decade of the 20th century—yet this second volume remained unfinished.

===Reviews and adjustments===
Rewald wrote that "the term 'Post-Impressionism' is not a very precise one, though a very convenient one." Convenient, when the term is by definition limited to French visual arts derived from Impressionism since 1886.  Rewald's approach to historical data was narrative rather than analytic, and beyond this point he believed it would be sufficient to "let the sources speak for themselves."&lt;ref name="Rewald 1978, p. 9"/&gt;

Rival terms like [[Modernism]] or [[Symbolism in art|Symbolism]] were never as easy to handle, for they covered literature, architecture and other arts as well, and they expanded to other countries.

* [[Modernism]], thus, is now considered to be the central movement within ''international'' western civilization with its original roots in France, going back beyond the [[French Revolution]] to the [[Age of Enlightenment]].
* [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], however, is considered to be a concept which emerged a century later in France, and implied an individual approach. Local national traditions as well as individual settings therefore could stand side by side, and from the very beginning a broad variety of artists practicing some kind of symbolic imagery, ranged between extreme positions: [[The Nabis]] for example united to find synthesis of tradition and brand new form, while others kept to traditional, more or less academic forms, when they were looking for fresh contents: Symbolism is therefore often linked to fantastic, esoteric, erotic and other non-realist subject matter.

To meet the recent discussion, the connotations of the term 'Post-Impressionism' were challenged again: [[Alan Bowness]] and his collaborators expanded the period covered forward to 1914 and the beginning of [[World War I]], but limited their approach widely on the 1890s to France. Other European countries are pushed back to standard connotations, and Eastern Europe is completely excluded.

So, while a split may be seen between classical 'Impressionism' and 'Post-Impressionism' in 1886, the end and the extent of 'Post-Impressionism' remains under discussion. For Bowness and his contributors as well as for Rewald, '[[Cubism]]' was an absolutely fresh start, and so Cubism has been seen in France since the beginning, and later in Anglosaxonia. Meanwhile, Eastern European artists, however, did not care so much for western traditions, and proceeded to manners of painting called [[Abstract painting|abstract]] and [[Suprematism|suprematic]]—terms expanding far into the 20th century.

According to the present state of discussion, ''Post-Impressionism'' is a term best used within Rewald's definition in a strictly historical manner, concentrating on French art between 1886 and 1914, and re-considering the altered positions of ''[[Impressionists|impressionist]]'' painters like [[Claude Monet]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Auguste Renoir]], and others—as well as all new schools and movements at the turn of the century: from [[Cloisonnism]] to [[Cubism]]. The declarations of war, in July/August 1914, indicate probably far more than the beginning of a [[World War I|World War]]—they signal a major break in European cultural history, too.

Along with general art history information given about "Post-Impressionism" works, there are many museums that offer additional history, information and gallery works, both online and in house, that can help viewers understand a deeper meaning of "Post-Impressionism" in terms of fine art and traditional art applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2448">The '''rain-out model''' is a [[Scientific modelling|model]] of [[planetary science]] that describes the first stage of [[planetary differentiation]] and [[core (geology)|core]] formation. According to this model, a [[Planet|planetary body]] is assumed to be composed primarily of [[silicate mineral]]s and [[NiFe]] (i.e. a mixture of [[nickel]] and [[iron]]). If temperatures within this body reach about 1500&amp;nbsp;K, the minerals and the metals will melt. This will produce an [[emulsion]] in which globules of liquid NiFe are dispersed in a [[magma]] of liquid silicates, the two being [[immiscible]]. Because the NiFe globules are denser than the silicates, they will sink under the influence of gravity to the centre of the planetary body—in effect, the globules of metal will "rain out" from the emulsion to the centre, forming a core.

According to the rain-out model, core formation was a relatively rapid process, taking a few dozen millennia to reach completion. This occurred at the end of a lengthy process in which the planets were assembled from colliding [[planetary embryo]]s. Only the collisions of such large embryos could generate enough heat to melt entire bodies. Furthermore, it was only after all of the iron and nickel delivered by impacting bodies had arrived that core formation could proceed to completion.

However, this process of core formation was preceded by a long period of partial differentiation, in which some of the nickel and iron within the planetary embryos had begun to separate.

The rain-out model can be invoked to explain core formation in all the [[terrestrial planet]]s, given that these consist primarily of silicates, nickel and iron. It can also be adapted to account for core formation in smaller bodies composed of [[volatiles|ices]] and silicates. In such a case, it would be the denser silicates which would rain out to form a rocky core, while the volatile components would form an icy mantle.

'''Clinton Richard Dawkins''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|FRS|FRSL}} (born 26 March 1941) is an English [[ethology|ethologist]], [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]], and [[author]]. He is an [[Oxford fellow|emeritus fellow]] of [[New College, Oxford]], and was the [[University of Oxford]]'s [[Simonyi Professorship for the Public Understanding of Science|Professor for Public Understanding of Science]] from 1995 until 2008.

Dawkins first came to prominence with his 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', which popularised the [[gene-centred view of evolution]] and introduced the term ''[[meme]]''. With his book ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]'' (1982), he introduced into [[evolutionary biology]] the influential concept that the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism's body, but can stretch far into the environment. In 2006, he founded the [[Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science]].

Dawkins is known as an outspoken [[atheist]]&lt;!-- Please do not change this to 'agnostic' without first consulting the "atheist-consensus" as established on the talk page and its archives - thank you. --&gt;. He has claimed in interviews to be an [[agnostic]] about many matters of [[faith and rationality|religious faith, instead endorsing reason]]. He is well known for his criticism of [[creationism]] and [[intelligent design]]. In ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' (1986), he argues against the [[watchmaker analogy]], an argument for the existence of a [[God|supernatural creator]] based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a ''blind'' watchmaker, in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. In ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a [[delusion]].

Dawkins has been awarded many prestigious academic and writing awards, and he makes regular television, radio, and Internet appearances, predominantly discussing his books, his atheism, and his ideas and opinions as a [[public intellectual]].

== Background ==

=== Early life ===

Dawkins was born in [[Nairobi]], then in [[British Kenya]], on 26 March 1941.&lt;ref name="encycdotcom" /&gt; He is the son of Jean Mary Vyvyan (''née'' Ladner; born 1916)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dawkins|first1=Richard|title=My mother is 100 today.

=== Teaching ===

From 1967 to 1969, he was an assistant professor of zoology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. During this period, the students and faculty at UC Berkeley were largely opposed to the ongoing [[Vietnam War]], and Dawkins became involved in the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-war]] demonstrations and activities.&lt;ref name="belief interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/atheism/people/dawkins.shtml |title="Belief" interview |accessdate=8 April 2008 |date=5 April 2004 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the University of Oxford in 1970 as a lecturer. In 1990, he became a [[reader (academic rank)|reader]] in zoology. In 1995, he was appointed [[Simonyi Professorship for the Public Understanding of Science|Simonyi Professor for the Public Understanding of Science]] at Oxford, a position that had been endowed by [[Charles Simonyi]] with the express intention that the holder "be expected to make important contributions to the public understanding of some scientific field",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/aims/charles-simonyis-manifesto.html |title=Manifesto for the Simonyi Professorship |accessdate=13 March 2008 |last=Simonyi |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Simonyi |date=15 May 1995 |publisher=The University of Oxford |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205051240/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/aims/charles-simonyis-manifesto.html |archivedate=5 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that its first holder should be Richard Dawkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/aims.html |title=Aims of the Simonyi Professorship |date=23 April 2008 |accessdate=28 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206202718/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/aims.html |archivedate=6 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He held that professorship from 1995 until 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/previous-holders-simonyi-professorship.html |title=Previous holders of The Simonyi Professorship |accessdate=23 September 2010 |publisher=The University of Oxford |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131193825/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/previous-holders-simonyi-professorship.html |archivedate=31 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary biology===
{{further|Gene-centred view of evolution}}

[[File:Dawkins at UT Austin.jpg|thumb|right|upright|At the [[University of Texas at Austin]], March 2008]]

Dawkins is best known for his popularisation of the [[gene]] as the principal [[unit of selection]] in [[evolution]]; this view is most clearly set out in his books:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Richard Dawkins: How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think : Reflections by Scientists, Writers, and Philosophers| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lH4sh2436rEC&amp;q=%22evolutionary+biologist%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22evolutionary%20biologist%22&amp;f=false| year=2007| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0-19-921466-2| page=228| first1=Mark| last1=Ridley }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Lloyd| first=Elisabeth Anne| title=The structure and confirmation of evolutionary theory| url=https://books.google.com/?id=hO8vHTSiBkAC| year=1994| publisher=Princeton University Press| isbn=978-0-691-00046-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (1976), in which he notes that "all life evolves by the differential survival of replicating entities".
* ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]'' (1982), in which he describes [[natural selection]] as "the process whereby [[DNA replication|replicators]] out-propagate each other". He introduces to a wider audience the influential concept he presented in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dawkins |first1=Richard |title=Replicator Selection and the Extended Phenotype |journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie |date=1978 |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=61–76 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1978.tb01823.x |pmid=696023}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism's body, but can stretch far into the environment, including the bodies of other organisms. Dawkins regarded the extended phenotype as his single most important contribution to evolutionary biology and he considered [[niche construction]] to be a special case of extended phenotype. The concept of extended phenotype helps explain evolution, but it does not help predict specific outcomes.&lt;ref name="esf"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090119081333.htm |title=European Evolutionary Biologists Rally Behind Richard Dawkins's Extended Phenotype |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=20 January 2009 |accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins has consistently been &lt;!-- PLEASE NOTE: 'sceptical' is the correct British spelling, and Dawkins is British --&gt;sceptical about non-adaptive processes in evolution (such as [[spandrel (biology)|spandrels]], described by [[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin|Lewontin]])&lt;ref name="gould-lewontin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |author2=Lewontin, Richard C. |author2-link=Richard Lewontin |year=1979 |title=The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London |volume=205 |issue=1161 |series=B |pages=581–598|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/205/1161/581.short | doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0086 | pmid=42062|accessdate=14 August 2009|bibcode=1979RSPSB.205..581G }}&lt;/ref&gt; and about selection at levels "above" that of the gene.&lt;ref name=Extended_Phenotype&gt;{{cite book |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |title=The extended phenotype: the long reach of the gene |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0192880512 |edition=Revised with new afterword and further reading}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is particularly &lt;!-- PLEASE NOTE: 'sceptical' is the correct British spelling, and Dawkins is British --&gt;sceptical about the practical possibility or importance of [[group selection]] as a basis for understanding [[altruism]].{{sfn|Dawkins|2006|p=169–172}}
This behaviour appears at first to be an evolutionary paradox, since helping others costs precious resources and decreases one's own [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]. Previously, many had interpreted this as an aspect of group selection: individuals are doing what is best for the survival of the population or species as a whole. British evolutionary biologist [[W. D. Hamilton]] used gene-frequency analysis in his [[inclusive fitness]] theory to show how hereditary altruistic traits can evolve if there is sufficient genetic similarity between actors and recipients of such altruism (including close relatives).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=W.D. |authorlink=W. D. Hamilton |title=The genetical evolution of social behaviour I and II |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=1–16, 17–52 |year=1964 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4 |pmid=5875341}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|a|a|none}} Hamilton's inclusive fitness has since been successfully applied to a wide range of organisms, including [[human inclusive fitness|humans]]. Similarly, [[Robert Trivers]], thinking in terms of the gene-centred model, developed the theory of [[reciprocal altruism]], whereby one organism provides a benefit to another in the expectation of future reciprocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trivers |first=Robert |title=The evolution of reciprocal altruism |journal=Quarterly Review of Biology |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=35–57 |year=1971|doi=10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins popularised these ideas in ''The Selfish Gene'', and developed them in his own work.&lt;ref name="dawkins79"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |title=Twelve Misunderstandings of Kin Selection |journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie |volume=51 |pages=184–200 |year=1979|url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/writings/Twelve%20Misunderstandings%20of%20Kin%20Selection.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529180009/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/writings/Twelve%20Misunderstandings%20of%20Kin%20Selection.pdf |archivedate=29 May 2008 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1979.tb00682.x|doi-broken-date=2018-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, Dawkins was highly critical of fellow biologist [[E.

Critics of Dawkins's biological approach suggest that taking the [[gene]] as the unit of ''selection'' (a single event in which an individual either succeeds or fails to reproduce) is misleading. The gene could be better described, they say, as a unit of ''evolution'' (the long-term changes in [[allele]] frequencies in a population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Dover| first=Gabriel| title=Dear Mr Darwin| year=2000| publisher=London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson| isbn=978-0-7538-1127-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Selfish Gene'', Dawkins explains that he is using [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]]'s definition of the gene as "that which segregates and recombines with appreciable frequency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Williams| first=George C.| title=Adaptation and Natural Selection| url=https://books.google.com/?id=wWZEq87CqO0C| year=1966| publisher=Princeton University Press| location=United States| isbn=978-0-691-02615-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common objection is that a gene cannot survive alone, but must cooperate with other genes to build an individual, and therefore a gene cannot be an independent "unit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Mayr| first=Ernst| authorlink=Ernst Mayr| title=What Evolution Is| year=2000| publisher=Basic Books| isbn=978-0-465-04426-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Extended Phenotype'', Dawkins suggests that from an individual gene's viewpoint, all other genes are part of the environment to which it is adapted.

Advocates for higher levels of selection (such as [[Richard Lewontin]], [[David Sloan Wilson]], and [[Elliott Sober]]) suggest that there are many phenomena (including altruism) that gene-based selection cannot satisfactorily explain.

When asked if [[Neo-Darwinism|Darwinism]] informs his everyday apprehension of life, Dawkins says, "In one way it does. My eyes are constantly wide open to the extraordinary fact of existence. Not just human existence but the existence of life and how this breathtakingly powerful process, which is natural selection, has managed to take the very simple facts of physics and chemistry and build them up to redwood trees and humans. That's never far from my thoughts, that sense of amazement. On the other hand I certainly don't allow Darwinism to influence my feelings about human social life," implying that he feels that individual human beings can opt out of the survival machine of Darwinism since they are freed by the [[consciousness]] of self.&lt;ref name="strident" /&gt;

=== Fathering the meme ===
{{Main|Meme}}

In his book ''The Selfish Gene'', Dawkins [[neologism|coined]] the word ''meme'' (the behavioural equivalent of a gene) as a way to encourage readers to think about how Darwinian principles might be extended beyond the realm of genes.{{sfn|Dawkins|1989|p=11}} It was intended as an extension of his "replicators" argument, but it took on a life of its own in the hands of other authors, such as [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Susan Blackmore]]. These popularisations then led to the emergence of [[memetics]], a field from which Dawkins has distanced himself.&lt;ref name="misunderstanding"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burman | first1 = J. T. | year = 2012 | title = The misunderstanding of memes: Biography of an unscientific object, 1976–1999 | url = | journal = [[Perspectives on Science]] | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 75–104 | doi = 10.1162/POSC_a_00057 }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins's ''meme'' refers to any cultural entity that an observer might consider a replicator of a certain idea or set of ideas. He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as capable of such replication, generally through communication and contact with humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of [[cultural evolution]] based on memes, a notion that is analogous to the theory of biological evolution based on genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Kelly |first=Kevin | title = Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World| year = 1994| publisher = Addison-Wesley| location = United States| isbn = 978-0-201-48340-6| page = 360 |title-link=Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Dawkins invented the term ''meme'', he has not claimed that the idea was entirely novel,&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been other expressions for similar ideas in the past. For instance, John Laurent has suggested that the term may have derived from the work of the little-known German biologist [[Richard Semon]].&lt;ref name="mneme"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semon regarded "mneme" as the collective set of neural memory traces (conscious or subconscious) that were inherited, although such view would be considered as [[Lamarckian]] by modern biologists.&lt;ref name="leiden"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laurent also found the use of the term ''mneme'' in [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]'s ''The Life of the White Ant'' (1926), and Maeterlinck himself stated that he obtained the phrase from Semon's work.&lt;ref name=mneme/&gt; In his own work, Maeterlinck tried to explain memory in termites and ants by claiming that neural memory traces were added "upon the individual mneme".&lt;ref name="leiden"/&gt; Nonetheless, [[James Gleick]] describes Dawkins's concept of the meme as "his most famous memorable invention, far more influential than his [[The Selfish Gene|selfish gene]]s or his later proselytising against religiosity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = James |last=Gleick | title = The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood| date = 15 February 2011| publisher = Pantheon| isbn = 978-0-375-42372-7| page = 269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foundation ===
{{Main|Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science}}

In 2006, Dawkins founded the ''Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science'' (''RDFRS''), a [[non-profit organisation]]. RDFRS financed research on the [[psychology of religion|psychology of belief and religion]], financed scientific education programs and materials, and publicised and supported [[charitable organisation]]s that are [[secularity|secular]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richarddawkins.net/foundation,ourMission |title=Our Mission |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |accessdate=17 November 2006 |publisher=Richard Dawkins Foundation |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061117150429/http://www.richarddawkins.net/foundation,ourMission |archivedate =17 November 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, it was announced that the foundation was merging with the [[Center for Inquiry]], with Dawkins becoming a member of the new organization's board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldreligionnews.com/religion-news/atheism/richard-dawkins-atheist-organization-merges-with-center-for-inquiry |title = Richard Dawkins' Atheist Organization Merges with Center for Inquiry |date=26 January 2016 |accessdate=26 January 2016 |website =WorldReligionNews.com |publisher = |last = Lesley |first = Alison }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism of religion ===

[[File:Richard dawkins lecture.jpg|thumb|upright|Lecturing on his book ''[[The God Delusion]]'', 24 June 2006]]

Dawkins was confirmed into the Church of England at the age of 13, but began to grow sceptical of the beliefs. After learning about Darwinism and the scientific reason why living things look as though they have been designed, Dawkins lost the remainder of his religious faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alternet.org/story/46566/atheist_richard_dawkins_on_'the_god_delusion' |title=Atheist Richard Dawkins on 'The God Delusion' |accessdate=30 December 2012 |last=McNally |first=Terrence |date=17 January 2007 |publisher=alternet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that his understanding of science and evolutionary processes led him to question how adults in positions of leadership in a civilized world could still be so uneducated in biology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/178/story_17889_2.html |title=The Problem with God: Interview with Richard Dawkins (2) |accessdate=11 April 2008 |last=Sheahen |first=Laura |date=October 2005 |publisher=Beliefnet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is puzzled by how belief in God could remain among individuals who are sophisticated in science. Dawkins notes that some physicists use 'God' as a metaphor for the general awe-inspiring mysteries of the universe, which causes confusion and misunderstanding among people who incorrectly think they are talking about a mystical being who forgives sins, transubstantiates wine, or makes people live after they die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/faithandreason/transcript/dawk-frame.html |title=Interview with Richard Dawkins |accessdate=12 April 2008 |publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; He disagrees with [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s principle of [[Non-overlapping magisteria|nonoverlapping magisteria (NOMA)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1555132-3,00.html |title=God vs. Science (3) |accessdate=3 April 2008 |date=5 November 2006 |last=Van Biema |first=David |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests that the [[existence of God]] should be treated as a scientific hypothesis like any other.{{sfn|Dawkins|2006|p=50}} Dawkins became a prominent [[criticism of religion|critic of religion]] and has stated his [[Antireligion|opposition to religion]] as twofold: religion is both a source of conflict and a justification for belief without evidence.{{sfn|Dawkins|2006|p=282–286}} He considers faith—belief that is not based on evidence—as "one of the world's great evils".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/articles/dawkins.html |title=Is Science A Religion?|publisher=The Humanist |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |date=1 January 1997 |accessdate=31 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030144700/http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/articles/dawkins.html |archivedate=30 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his [[spectrum of theistic probability]], which has seven levels between 1 (100% certainty that a God or gods exist) and 7 (100% certainty that a God or gods do not exist), Dawkins has said he is a 6.9, which represents a "de facto atheist" who thinks "I cannot know for certain but I think God is very improbable, and I live my life on the assumption that he is not there." When asked about his slight uncertainty, Dawkins quips, "I am agnostic to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9102740/Richard-Dawkins-I-cant-be-sure-God-does-not-exist.html |title=Richard Dawkins: I can't be sure God does not exist |date=24 February 2012 |accessdate=5 March 2016 |first=John |last=Bingham |location=London |work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/side-effects/201202/why-does-richard-dawkins-take-issue-agnosticism |title=Why Does Richard Dawkins Take Issue With Agnosticism? |date=2 February 2012 |accessdate=5 April 2016 |work=Psychology Today |first=Christopher |last=Lane}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, at the [[Hay Festival]] in Wales, Dawkins explained that while he does not believe in the supernatural elements of the Christian faith, he still has nostalgia for the ceremonial side of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sarah |last=Knapton |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/10853648/Richard-Dawkins-I-am-a-secular-Christian.html |title=Richard Dawkins: 'I am a secular Christian' |newspaper=Telegraph |accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to beliefs in deities, Dawkins has criticized other irrational religious beliefs such as Jesus turned water into wine, that an embryo starts as a blob, that magic underwear will protect you, that Jesus was resurrected, that [[semen]] comes from the spine, that Jesus walked on water, that the sun sets in a marsh, that the Garden of Eden existed in Missouri, that Jesus' mother was a virgin, that Muhammad split the moon, and that Lazarus was raised from the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/richard-dawkins-islamophobic-berkeley-event-cancelled-islam-muslim-uc-university-california-a7860281.html|title=Richard Dawkins hits back at allegations he is Islamophobic after Berkeley event is cancelled}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/681453611906396160|title=Dawkins Twitter This is almost as impressive as the prescient knowledge that embryo starts as a blob, semen comes from the spine &amp; the sun sets in a marsh.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/344419641101275137|title="Did Jesus exist?"

Dawkins has risen to prominence in public debates concerning science and religion since the publication of his most popular book, ''The God Delusion'', in 2006, which became an international best seller.&lt;ref name="michaelpowell"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/science/20dawkins.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=A Knack for Bashing Orthodoxy|newspaper=New York Times|first=Michael|last=Powell|accessdate=31 December 2012|date=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, more than three million copies have been sold and the book has been translated into over 30 languages.{{sfn|Dawkins|2015|p=173}} Its success has been seen by many as indicative of a change in the contemporary cultural [[zeitgeist]] and has also been identified with the rise of [[New Atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/11/08/atheism.feature/index.html |title=The rise of the New Atheists |publisher=CNN |first=Simon |last=Hooper |date=9 November 2006 |accessdate=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a [[delusion]]—"a fixed false belief".{{sfn|Dawkins|2006|p=5}} In his February 2002 TED talk entitled "Militant atheism", Dawkins urged all atheists to openly state their position and to fight the incursion of the church into politics and science.&lt;ref name="militant" /&gt; On 30 September 2007, Dawkins, [[Christopher Hitchens]], [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], and [[Daniel Dennett]] met at Hitchens's residence for a private, unmoderated discussion that lasted two hours.

Dawkins sees education and [[consciousness raising|consciousness-raising]] as the primary tools in opposing what he considers to be religious dogma and indoctrination.&lt;ref name="belief interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="education"&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Alexandra |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/story/0,,1958138,00.html |title=Dawkins campaigns to keep God out of classroom |accessdate=15 January 2007 |date=27 November 2006 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bright"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,981412,00.html |title=The future looks bright |accessdate=13 March 2008 |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |date=21 June 2003 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tools include the fight against certain stereotypes, and he has adopted the term ''[[brights movement|bright]]'' as a way of associating positive public connotations with those who possess a [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] worldview.&lt;ref name="bright"/&gt; He has given support to the idea of a free-thinking school,&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;{{cite news|last=Powell |first=Michael |title=A Knack for Bashing Orthodoxy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/science/20dawkins.html |date=19 September 2011 |work=The New York Times |page=4 |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would not "indoctrinate children" but would instead teach children to ask for evidence, be skeptical, critical, and open-minded. Such a school, says Dawkins, should "teach comparative religion, and teach it properly without any bias towards particular religions, and including historically important but dead religions, such as those of ancient Greece and the Norse gods, if only because these, like the Abrahamic scriptures, are important for understanding English literature and European history.&lt;ref name="telegraph1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Beckford |first=Martin |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/7849563/Richard-Dawkins-interested-in-setting-up-atheist-free-school.html |title=Richard Dawkins interested in setting up 'atheist free school' |newspaper=Telegraph |date=24 June 2010 |accessdate=29 July 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/gove-welcomes-atheist-schools-2037990.html |title=Gove welcomes atheist schools – Education News, Education |newspaper=The Independent |date= 29 July 2010|accessdate=29 July 2010 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Garner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the consciousness-raising successes of [[Feminism|feminists]] in arousing widespread embarrassment at the routine use of "he" instead of "she", Dawkins similarly suggests that phrases such as "Catholic child" and "Muslim child" should be considered as socially absurd as, for instance, "Marxist child", as he believes that children should not be classified based on the ideological or religious beliefs of their parents.&lt;ref name="bright" /&gt;

==== Criticism of creationism ====

Dawkins is a prominent critic of [[creationism]], a religious belief that [[human]]ity, [[life]], and the [[universe]] were created by a [[deity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/creationism/|title=Creationism |last=Ruse |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Ruse|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Laboratory, [[Stanford University]]|quote=a Creationist is someone who believes in a god who is absolute creator of heaven and earth.|accessdate=9 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; without recourse to evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Scott| first = Eugenie C| authorlink = Eugenie Scott| title = Evolution vs. creationism: an introduction| date = 3 August 2009| publisher = University of California Press| location = Berkeley, CA| isbn = 978-0-520-26187-7| page = 51| chapter = Creationism| quote = The term 'creationism' to many people connotes the theological doctrine of special creationism: that God created the universe essentially as we see it today, and that this universe has not changed appreciably since that creation event. Special creationism includes the idea that God created living things in their present forms... }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has described the [[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth creationist]] view that the Earth is only a few thousand years old as "a preposterous, mind-shrinking falsehood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/mar/09/religion.schools1 |title=A scientist's view |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |date=9 March 2002 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=7 November 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1986 book, ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', contains a sustained critique of the [[Teleological argument|argument from design]], an important creationist argument. In the book, Dawkins argues against the [[watchmaker analogy]] made famous by the eighteenth-century English [[theology|theologian]] [[William Paley]] via his book ''Natural Theology'', in which Paley argues that just as a watch is too complicated and too functional to have sprung into existence merely by accident, so too must all living things—with their far greater complexity—be purposefully designed. Dawkins shares the view generally held by scientists that natural selection is sufficient to explain the apparent functionality and non-random complexity of the biological world, and can be said to play the role of watchmaker in nature, albeit as an automatic, unguided by any designer, nonintelligent, ''blind'' watchmaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Books/blind.shtml |title=Book: The Blind Watchmaker |accessdate=28 February 2008 |last=Catalano |first=John |publisher=The University of Oxford|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080415140851/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Books/blind.shtml |date=1 August 1996 |archivedate =15 April 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dawkins aaconf.jpg|thumb|Wearing a [[scarlet 'A']] lapel pin, at the 34th annual conference of [[American Atheists]] (2008)]]

In 1986, Dawkins and biologist [[John Maynard Smith]] participated in an [[Oxford Union]] debate against [[A. E. Wilder-Smith]] (a Young Earth creationist) and [[Edgar Andrews]] (president of the [[Biblical Creation Society]]).{{Ref label|b|b|none}} In general, however, Dawkins has followed the advice of his late colleague [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and refused to participate in formal debates with creationists because "what they seek is the oxygen of respectability", and doing so would "give them this oxygen by the mere act of ''engaging'' with them at all". He suggests that creationists "don't mind being beaten in an argument. What matters is that we give them recognition by bothering to argue with them in public."{{sfn|Dawkins|2003|p=218}} In a December 2004 interview with American journalist [[Bill Moyers]], Dawkins said that "among the things that science does know, evolution is about as certain as anything we know." When Moyers questioned him on the [[Evolution as theory and fact|use of the word ''theory'']], Dawkins stated that "evolution has been observed. It's just that it hasn't been observed while it's happening." He added that "it is rather like a detective coming on a murder after the scene... the detective hasn't actually seen the murder take place, of course. But what you do see is a massive clue... Huge quantities of circumstantial evidence. It might as well be spelled out in words of English."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript349_full.html#dawkins |title=''Now'' with Bill Moyers |accessdate=29 January 2006 |last=Moyers |first=Bill |date=3 December 2004 |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins has opposed the inclusion of [[intelligent design]] in science education, describing it as "not a scientific argument at all, but a religious one".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/sep/01/schools.research |title=One side can be wrong |accessdate=21 December 2006 |date=1 September 2005 |author1=Dawkins, Richard  |author2=Coyne, Jerry  |lastauthoramp=yes |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been referred to in the media as "Darwin's [[Rottweiler]]",&lt;ref name="discover"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2005/sep/darwins-rottweiler |title=Darwin's Rottweiler |accessdate=22 March 2008 |last=Hall |first=Stephen S. |date=9 August 2005 |work=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcgrath&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGrath|first1=Alister|title=Dawkins' God : genes, memes, and the meaning of life|date=2007|publisher=Blackwell|location=Malden, Mass.|isbn=978-1405125383|page=i|edition=Reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to English biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley|T.

He has been a strong critic of the British organisation [[Truth in Science]], which promotes the teaching of creationism in state schools, and whose work Dawkins has described as an "educational scandal". He plans to subsidise schools through the [[Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science]] with the delivery of books, DVDs, and pamphlets that counteract their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/student/news/article641971.ece |title=Godless Dawkins challenges schools |accessdate=3 April 2008 |date=19 November 2006 |last=Swinford |first=Steven |work=The Times | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins has expressed concern about the growth of human population and about the matter of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BBC: The Selfish Green |url=http://richarddawkins.net/article,829,The-Selfish-Green,Jonathan-Dimbleby-David-Attenborough-Richard-Dawkins-Jane-Goodall-Richard-Leakey |publisher=Richard Dawkins Foundation |date=2 April 2007 |accessdate=22 April 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080501094048/http://richarddawkins.net/article,829,The-Selfish-Green,Jonathan-Dimbleby-David-Attenborough-Richard-Dawkins-Jane-Goodall-Richard-Leakey |archivedate =1 May 2008|deadurl=yes}} For video in one segment, see {{YouTube | g5WUIDzxUeo }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Selfish Gene'', he briefly mentions population growth, giving the example of [[Latin America]], whose population, at the time the book was written, was doubling every 40&amp;nbsp;years. He is critical of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] attitudes to [[family planning]] and [[population control]], stating that leaders who forbid [[birth control|contraception]] and "express a preference for 'natural' methods of population limitation" will get just such a method in the form of [[starvation]].{{sfn|Dawkins|1989|p=213}}

As a supporter of the [[Great Ape Project]]—a movement to extend certain moral and legal [[rights]] to all [[Hominidae|great apes]]—Dawkins contributed the article 'Gaps in the Mind' to the ''Great Ape Project'' book edited by [[Paola Cavalieri]] and [[Peter Singer]]. In this essay, he criticises contemporary society's moral attitudes as being based on a "discontinuous, [[speciesism|speciesist]] imperative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor-first1= Paola | editor-last1= Cavalieri | editor-first2= Peter | editor-last2= Singer | title = The Great Ape Project| year = 1993| publisher = Fourth Estate| location = United Kingdom| isbn = 978-0-312-11818-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Dawkins expressed his appreciation for two books connected with the [[Sokal affair]], ''[[Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science]]'' by [[Paul R. Gross]] and [[Norman Levitt]] and ''[[Fashionable Nonsense|Intellectual Impostures]]'' by [[Alan Sokal|Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]].

In his role as professor for public understanding of science, Dawkins has been a critic of [[pseudoscience]] and [[alternative medicine]]. His 1998 book ''[[Unweaving the Rainbow]]'' considers [[John Keats]]'s accusation that by explaining the [[rainbow]], [[Isaac Newton]] diminished its beauty; Dawkins argues for the opposite conclusion. He suggests that deep space, the billions of years of life's evolution, and the microscopic workings of biology and heredity contain more beauty and wonder than do "myths" and "pseudoscience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Dawkins| first = Richard| title = Unweaving The Rainbow| year = 1998| publisher = Penguin| location = United Kingdom| isbn = 978-0-618-05673-6| pages = 4–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[John Diamond (journalist)|John Diamond]]'s posthumously published ''Snake Oil'', a book devoted to debunking alternative medicine, Dawkins wrote a foreword in which he asserts that alternative medicine is harmful, if only because it distracts patients from more successful conventional treatments and gives people false hopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Diamond| first = John| title = Snake Oil and Other Preoccupations| year = 2001| publisher = Vintage| location = United Kingdom| isbn = 978-0-09-942833-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins states that "There is no alternative medicine. There is only medicine that works and medicine that doesn't work."{{sfn|Dawkins|2003|p=58}} In his 2007 Channel 4 TV film ''The Enemies of Reason'', Dawkins concluded that Britain is gripped by "an epidemic of superstitious thinking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1559468/New-age-therapies-cause-retreat-from-reason.html |title=New age therapies cause 'retreat from reason' |date=5 August 2007 |first=David |last=Harrison |work=The Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing a long-standing partnership with [[Channel 4]], Dawkins participated in a five-part television series, ''[[Genius of Britain]]'', along with fellow scientists [[Stephen Hawking]], [[James Dyson]], [[Paul Nurse]], and [[Jim Al-Khalili]]. The series was first broadcast in June 2010, and focuses on major, British, scientific achievements throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/2009/01/dawkins_to_front_c4_science_series.html |title=C4 lines up Genius science series |date=27 January 2009 |first=Robin |last=Parker |accessdate=31 January 2009 |work=[[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]}} (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Riken'''|理研}} is a large [[research institute]] in Japan. Founded in 1917, it now has about 3,000 scientists on seven campuses across Japan, including the main site at [[Wakō, Saitama|Wakō]], [[Saitama Prefecture]], just outside [[Tokyo]]. Riken is a [[Japanese National Research and Development Agencies|Designated National Research and Development Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shingi/kokurituken/gijiroku/attach/__icsFiles/afieldfile/2016/07/15/1373910_01.pdf|title=MEXT|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was formerly an [[Independent Administrative Institution]]. "Riken" is a contraction of the formal name {{nihongo|'''Rikagaku Kenkyūjyo'''|理化学研究所}}, and its full name in Japanese is {{nihongo|'''Kokuritsu Kenkyū Kaihatsu Hōjin Rikagaku Kenkyūsho'''|国立研究開発法人理化学研究所}}.

Riken conducts research in many areas of science, including [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[medical science]], [[engineering]], [[high-performance computing]] and [[computer science|computational science]], and ranging from [[basic research]] to [[applied research|practical applications]] with 485 partners worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.riken.jp/en/outreach/research/&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost entirely funded by the [[Japanese government]], and its annual [[budget]] is about ¥88 billion (US$760 million).{{when|date=June 2016}}

==History==
[[Image:RIKEN building in Taisho period.JPG|thumb|Riken in the [[Taishō period]]]]
[[Image:RIKEN VITAMIN.png|thumb|A 1938 ad for Riken Vitamin A]]
In 1913, the well-known scientist [[Jokichi Takamine]] first proposed the establishment of a national science research institute in Japan. This task was taken on by Viscount [[Shibusawa Eiichi]], a prominent businessman, and following a resolution by the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] in 1915, Riken came into existence in March 1917. In its first incarnation, Riken was a private foundation (''zaidan''), funded by a combination of industry, the government, and the [[Japanese royal family|Imperial Household]]. It was located in the Komagome district of [[Tokyo]], and its first Director was the mathematician Baron [[Dairoku Kikuchi]].

In 1927, Viscount [[Masatoshi Ōkōchi]], the third Director, established the Riken Konzern (a [[zaibatsu]]). This was a group of spin-off companies that used Riken's scientific achievements for commercial ends and returned the profits to Riken. At its peak in 1939 the Konzern comprised about 121 factories and 63 companies, including Riken Kankōshi, which is now [[Ricoh]].

During [[World War II]] the [[Japanese atomic program|Japanese army's atomic bomb program]] was conducted at Riken. In April 1945 the US bombed Riken's laboratories in Komagome, and in November, after the end of the war, Allied soldiers destroyed its two [[cyclotron]]s.

After the war, the Allies dissolved Riken as a private foundation, and it was brought back to life as a company called {{nihongo |Kagaku Kenkyūjyo|科学研究所}}, or {{nihongo|Kaken|科研}}. In 1958 the Diet passed the Riken Law, whereby the institute returned to its original name and entered its third incarnation, as a {{nihongo |public corporation|特殊法人|tokushu hōjin}}, funded by the government. In 1963 it relocated to a large site in [[Wakō, Saitama|Wakō]] in [[Saitama Prefecture]], just outside [[Tokyo]].

Since the 1980s Riken has expanded dramatically. New labs, centers, and institutes have been established in Japan and overseas, including:
* in 1984, the Life Science Center in [[Tsukuba]]
* in 1995, the Muon Research Facility at the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]
* in 1997, the [[Harima]] Institute, the Brain Science Institute in Wako, and the center at the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] in the [[United States|USA]]
* in 1998, the Genomic Sciences Center
* in 2000, the Yokohama Institute, which now contains four centers for research in the life sciences
* in 2002, the Kobe Institute, which contains the Center for Developmental Biology

In October 2003, Riken's status changed again, to [[Independent Administrative Institution]]. As such, Riken is still publicly funded, and it is periodically evaluated by the government, but it has a higher degree of autonomy than before. Riken is regarded as the flagship research institute in Japan and conducts basic and applied experimental research in a wide range of science and technology fields including physics, chemistry, medical science, biology and engineering.

Riken was the subject of international attention in 2014 after the [[Stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency cell]] (also known as '''STAP''') publication, investigation, retraction, and suicide of [[Yoshiki Sasai]], the principal investigator. Observers, journalists, and former members of Riken have stated that the organization is riddled with unprofessional and inadequate scientific rigor and consistency, and that this is reflective of serious issues with scientific research in Japan in general.&lt;ref&gt;Otake, Tomoko, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/04/20/national/stapgate-shows-japan-must-get-back-to-basics-in-science/#.U1WkzMKRVZI 'STAPgate' shows Japan must get back to basics in science]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 21 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Mark, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/07/05/national/media-national/ongoing-obokata-story-seeks-scandal/#.U7qcsY2KB9A Ongoing Obokata story seeks out scandal]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 5 July 2014, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Eisenman''' (born 1937) is an American [[biblical scholar]], theoretical writer, historian, [[archaeology|archaeologist]], and "road" poet. He is currently professor of Middle East religions, archaeology, and Islamic law and director of the Institute for the Study of
Judaeo-Christian Origins at [[California State University Long Beach]].

Eisenman led the campaign to free up access to the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] in the 1980s and 90s, and, as a result of this campaign, is associated with the theory that combines [[Essenes]] with Palestinian messianism (or what some might refer to as "Palestinian Christianity") — a theory opposed to establishment or [[Scientific consensus|consensus]] scholarship.

Before this, Eisenman spent five years "on the road" in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East as far as India, encapsulating all these things in his poetic travel ''Diario'' (1959–62), published in 2007 by [[North Atlantic Books]], Berkeley, California and called ''The New Jerusalem'', in which he describes the San Francisco "[[Beat Generation|Beat]]" scene in 1958–59, Paris when still a "[[moveable feast]]", working on [[kibbutzim]] in Israel, the [[Peace Corps]], and several voyages on the overland route to India.

==Life and career==
Robert Eisenman is from [[New Jersey]]. He was born to assimilated Jewish parents&lt;ref name="longing"&gt;Eran Neuman, ''Longing for the Impossible'', [http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/leisure/longing-for-the-impossible-1.289816  Haaretz, 12 May 2010]. Quote (referring to his brother, Peter Eisenman): ''"I didn't know I was Jewish until I encountered anti-Semitism at the age of 10..." Even though he grew up in a non-Zionist and assimilated family where his father held radical leftist views....''&lt;/ref&gt; His brother is [[Deconstructivism|deconstructionist architect]] [[Peter Eisenman]] — best known for his design of the [[Holocaust Memorial]] in [[Berlin]], the Visitor’s Center at [[Santiago de Compostela]] in [[Spain]], and the [[University of Phoenix Stadium|Arizona Cardinal Football Stadium]].

===Education===
Eisenman (like [[Thomas Pynchon]]&lt;ref&gt;Ron Rosenbaum, "The Riddle of the Scrolls, “ Vanity Fair, November, 1992, pp. 224–28 and  Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, ''The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception'', pp. xvii–xvii&lt;/ref&gt;) majored for two and a half years in [[Engineering Physics]] (a course which was intended to prepare students to enter [[nuclear physics]]), graduated [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[Cornell University]] in Physics and Philosophy in 1958. He received an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] Degree in [[Hebrew]] and Near Eastern Studies with [[Abraham I. Katsh]] from [[New York University]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;California State University Website http://www.csulb.edu/centers/sjco/aboutpre.html&lt;/ref&gt; He received a Ph.D. Degree from [[Columbia University]] in  Middle East languages and cultures in 1971 with a minor in [[Jewish Studies]] and a major in [[Islamic law]], where he studied with [[Joseph Schacht]]. He was a [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] fellow at the [[American Schools of Oriental Research]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]], 1985–86 and, in 1986–87, he was a senior research fellow at the [[Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies]], [[Oxford]], [[England]].

===Current position===
He is professor of Middle East religions, archaeology, and Islamic law and the director of the Institute for the Study of [[Judeo-Christian]] and [[Islamic]] Origins at [[California State University Long Beach]]. He is also a visiting senior member of [[Linacre College]], [[Oxford University]], and was a National Endowment for the Humanities fellow at the Albright Institute of Archaeological Research (American Schools of Oriental Research) in Jerusalem.

===Early life===
Eisenman grew up in [[South Orange, New Jersey]] and went to [[Columbia High School (New Jersey)|Columbia High School]] in [[Maplewood, New Jersey|Maplewood]], but skipped his senior year to take up an acceptance in the Engineering Physics Department at [[Cornell University]]. In his junior year Eisenman moved, first to Philosophy to study with [[Max Black]], then on to [[Comparative Literature]] with [[John Senior]], and then back to Philosophy to graduate in 1958 with a major in [[Aesthetics]] and a minor in Physics.

===On the road internationally (1958–63)===
{{story|date=August 2017}}
Eisenman left college and immediately took to the road (it was the time of [[Jack Kerouac]]'s ''[[On the Road]]'' published the previous year, 1957), but now not nationally, internationally. People who knew him then say he was the first to introduce American tennis shoes — substitutes for his college "white bucks" — as white walking shoes to Europe (see the picture at right)&lt;ref&gt;Eisenman sitting before the Parthenon, December, 1958. Statement is from Dieter Buhl, former Political Editor of ''Die Zeit''. See also ''The New Jerusalem'' back cover and p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; and the first American "backpacker" they ever saw (Australians, New Zealanders, and assorted Europeans had been doing it earlier).&lt;ref&gt;See ''The New Jerusalem'', pp. 138, 399, and variously&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:eisenman greece.jpeg|right|thumb|300px|Photo: Eisenman before the Parthenon, December, 1958]]
Stopping in Paris, he spent the fall in [[Altaussee|Alt-Aussee]] in [[Austria]]; and from there to [[Vienna]] and down to [[Greece]], to [[Athens]] and ultimately [[Hydra Island]], where he was entertained by the Norwegian writer and poet [[Axel Jensen]] and his wife Marianne (later immortalized by [[Leonard Cohen]] in his song “[[So Long, Marianne]]”).

Having been accepted for graduate study in Comparative Literature at [[UC Berkeley]], Eisenman returned to the U.S. via [[Paris]] and [[Cape Cod]] and ultimately went across the country by [[Greyhound Bus]] to [[San Francisco]] where he found a room on [[Russian Hill]] and tested the scene at North Beach. When he finally went across the Bay to register at [[UC Berkeley]], what he saw reminded him so much of [[Cornell]] ([[Bermuda shorts]], [[bobby socks]], fraternities/sororities, etc. – this was a decade before the [[Free Speech Movement]] there) that he ripped up his [[computer punch card]]s right on the Registration line in the Armory and tossed them into a wastepaper basket.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Jerusalem'', p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

He then hitchhiked back across the country&lt;ref&gt;See ''The New Jerusalem'', pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to Paris. From 1959 to 1960, Eisenman stayed at “the [[Beat Hotel]]” where he encountered the likes of [[William Burroughs]], [[Gregory Corso]], et al.,&lt;ref&gt;See ''The New Jerusalem'', pictures, pp. 242ff.&lt;/ref&gt; but he was not really interested in these sorts of persons or their scene. All this he documents in ''The New Jerusalem: A Millennium Poetic/Prophetic Travel Diario, 1959–62'',&lt;ref&gt;See ''The New Jerusalem'', pp. 7–17, 70–81, 294, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2007 and taken directly from the [[free verse]] notebooks he kept during this period, which he in his "Introduction" and his publishers on the back cover both call "an Anti-Beat Manifesto".&lt;ref&gt;See ''The New Jerusalem'', pp. xi–xiii and back cover description. For his anti-Beat sentiments and statements generally, see pp. 129, 321, 452, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

He then went on to [[Israel]] and [[Jerusalem]], where he had the epiphany of encountering members of his family of whom he had previously never heard (his great grandfather had gone to Jerusalem at the time of the Turks and was one of the founders of the [[Bikur Holim Hospital]] there, while his two oldest sons left him in [[Istanbul]] and came directly to America&lt;ref&gt;See ''The New Jerusalem'', p. 67; also see pp. 41–44, 112–16, etc. and obituary for Morris Eisenman, ''New York Times'', 1/20/1948, who came to U.S. in 1888, age 14, along with his older brother, Eisenman's grandfather, and was President and co-founder with David Sarnoff in 1897 of The Metropolitan News Company, an early Zionist, great philanthropist, patron of the arts, and close personal friend of Chaim Weizmann (cf. letter dated 7/10/1942, C.W. to M.E., St. Regis Hotel, NYC), helped found the ''Abendblatt'' Yiddush Newspaper, ''The Jewish Forward'', and Chaim Nahman Bialik and Shmaryahu Levin's ''Dvir'' Publishing Company in then Tel Aviv, Palestine, friend of Shalom Asch, and funded childhood "newsie" friend Samuel Roth's first U.S. publication attempt of James Joyce's ''Ulysses'' in 1927 and, through the Morris Eisenman Literary Fund, Yiddush writer Osip Dymow in 1942, the Second Avenue Yiddush Theater, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;), worked on [[Kibbutzim]] in the [[Galilee]] (1960–61 — he had previously worked on [[John F. Kennedy]]’s 1960 Campaign,&lt;ref&gt;See “America, I Call upon You,” ''The New Jerusalem'', pp. 49, 52–59, and 63–68&lt;/ref&gt;) and finally went back to join the first [[Peace Corps]] Group to go into the field. This, curiously enough, trained at the International House at [[UC Berkeley]], so he was back to where he had started out; but while they went on to meet Kennedy on the [[White House]] lawn and to [[Ghana]], he was flown back to [[New York City]] because, as he saw it, he was on his way to India and the East not Africa.&lt;ref&gt;See ''The New Jerusalem'', pp. 98–104. Curiously this poem, “America, I Call upon You,” became something of "an anthem" for this group, ''ibid.'', pp. xi–xii&lt;/ref&gt;

Resuming his “Passage to India,” he returned to Paris, and then on to kibbutzim in the Galilee again.&lt;ref&gt;See ''The New Jerusalem'', pp. 107–32&lt;/ref&gt; The next Spring, after staying in monasteries throughout Israel, and a climactic fight with the future Israeli “Peace Pilot” at the California Café in [[Tel Aviv]];&lt;ref&gt;See ''The New Jerusalem'',  pp. 224–59&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenman made the last overland run from [[Cyprus]], across [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], [[Beluchistan]], and [[Pakistan]] by bus, train, and boat to [[India]], where he ended his journey as a guest of, and sleeping in, the Jewish Synagogue of [[New Delhi]],&lt;ref&gt;See ''The New Jerusalem'', pp. 344–446&lt;/ref&gt; most of whose members were up in the [[Simla Hill States]] because it was high summer and monsoon. He returned to Paris over the [[Indian Ocean]], up the [[Red Sea]], and across the [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref&gt;See'' The New Jerusalem'', pp. 446–53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release of the Dead Sea Scrolls==
From  about 1986 onwards, Eisenman became the leading figure in the struggle to release and free the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. The Scrolls had been discovered from 1948 to 1956 in several waves, but after a suggestive article by literary critic [[Edmund Wilson]] in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;“The Scrolls from the Dead Sea,” ''The New Yorker'', 5/14/55.&lt;/ref&gt; editing more or less ground to a halt from about 1959 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Baigent and Leigh, ''The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception'', London and New York, 1991, pp. 26–66; Eisenman, "The Desecration of the Scrolls," ''Midstream'', December, 1991, pp. 13–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is not to say the Scrolls were not out. The Israelis had been very forthcoming with the first Scrolls that came into their possession from Cave I.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Asher Silberman, ''The Hidden Scrolls'', New York, 1994, pp. 39–67.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the Scrolls from later caves discovered like III–XI, which came in after 1948 and Partition and on-site excavations by persons like Dominican Father [[Roland de Vaux]], which were the problem. In 1985–86, Eisenman, who had written his first book presenting, as he called it,  “A New Theory of Qumran Origins” in 1983&lt;ref&gt;See ''Maccabees, Zadokites, Christians and Qumran'', Leiden, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; and a follow-up on James as Righteous Teacher in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;''James the Just in the Habakkuk Pesher'', Leiden, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; received a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship at the Albright Institute of Archaeological Research in Jerusalem (also known as “the American School") where Cave I Scrolls had first come in and been photographed in 1947–48.&lt;ref&gt;See J. C. Trever, ''Scrolls from Qumran Cave 1'', Jerusalem, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ostensibly he was to work on a project comparing the Jerusalem Community of [[James the Just]] to the Community at [[Qumran]], but while at the [[American Schools of Oriental Research]] (then the Albright Institute) he found that there was nothing he could do – all paths being barred to him. Notwithstanding, he and a colleague, [[Philip Davies]] of [[Sheffield University]], [[England]], went in to see one of the curators of the Shrine of the Book and were told categorically, “You will not see the Scrolls in your lifetime.”&lt;ref&gt;Eisenman, The Desecration of the Scrolls, ''Midstream'', December, 1991, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he came into possession of the complete computer print-out of all the Scrolls in possession of the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]], both those before 1967 and those afterwards at the [[Rockefeller Museum]] and, not three years later, a complete photographic archive of all previously unpublished materials from Cave IV all the way up to Cave XI.

He sent a copy of this computer-generated print-out to the Editor of ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'', [[Hershel Shanks]], which created a huge stir in the office and the campaign to free the Scrolls really began in earnest.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dead Seas Scrolls Deception'', pp. 73–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his stay at [[Oxford University]] as a senior fellow at the [[Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies]] and a visiting senior member of [[Linacre College]] in 1986–87, a colleague had also passed him a [[xerox]] copy of [[4QMMT]], a document which had been talked about but which no one outside the inner circle had ever been allowed to see. This, too, he freely shared with anyone who wanted to see it as part of the campaign,&lt;ref&gt;This included Prof. Davies, who fatefully shared it with Prof. Zdzslaw Kapera in Poland; see ''The Dead Seas Scrolls Deception,'' pp. 85–89.&lt;/ref&gt; and, thereafter, it made the rounds.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hidden Scrolls'', pp. 39–67 and 233–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, too, he brought [[James M. Robinson|James Robinson]] – a colleague of his at [[Claremont University]] and the Editor of the [[Nag Hammadi library|Nag Hammadi]] Codices (a dispute similar to the [[Qumran]] one)&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Robinson, ''The Nag Hammadi Library in English'', San Francisco, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; – into the mix and together they took the decision to publish all the unpublished photographs. This amounted to 1785 plates. The original  publication (in [[microfiche]] form) was supposed to occur in April, 1991 through [[EJ Brill]] in [[Leiden]], the [[Netherlands]].

However, a few weeks before publication, Brill's representative had attended a Scrolls Conference in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]] and mistook the uproar there over Kapera’s publication the year before in [[Poland]] of the [[samizdat]] copy of [[4QMMT]] he had received from Davies for a dispute over freedom of access to the Scrolls generally. Following this, newly appointed Israeli representatives came to Leiden and talked the Brill publishers out of the Eisenman/Robinson [[microfiche]] project and into a newly conceived one of their own.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dead Sea Scrolls on Microfiche'', Leiden, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; So Eisenman and Robinson had to fall back on the offices of [[Hershel Shanks]] and the [[Biblical Archaeology Society]] who were unwilling to go to press before October/November of that year.&lt;ref&gt;''A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls'', B.A.S., Washington D. C., 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The publication was contracted by public interest attorney [[William John Cox]].&lt;ref&gt;Silberman, Neil Asher, ''The Hidden Scrolls'', p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

While all these things were going on, Eisenman had been invited to become a consultant to the [[Huntington Library]] in [[San Marino]], [[California]], which had become aware that it had in its archive a collection of photographs of all the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], donated to it by [[Elizabeth Bechtel]]. The late [[William Andrew Moffett|William Moffett]], its director, asked whether he thought the library should open its archive to all scholars. He was projecting this for September, two months before Eisenman's and Robinson’s own projected B.A.S. Edition. Eisenman encouraged him to do so, though he knew the library would get most of the credit for breaking the monopoly and Robinson and he very little.&lt;ref&gt;See "The Riddle of the Scrolls", ''Vanity Fair'', November, 1992, pp. 224–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surveys, groundscans, and excavations==
Since 1988, Eisenman has led the Judean Desert Explorations/Excavations Project under the auspices of the Institute for the Study of Judeo-Christian Origins at [[CSULB]] he headed. These expeditions included students from CSULB and other institutions. Its aim was to search for possible new caves that might contain scrolls. It was his feeling that, though the [[Bedouin]]s in their enthusiasm to find artifacts had clearly been in almost all accessible caves, there might have been others, inaccessible to them or hidden in some manner or cave-ins. These were the best possibilities of finding new scrolls.

In the first expedition, between 1988 and 1989, he and his students were involved in the excavation of a cave a kilometer or two south of Qumran, in which they found some [[Bronze Age]] artifacts, including an arrow that had evidently been shot into the cave, which still displayed its [[lacquer]] rings and feather marks, an oil jug, and the wooden remains possibly of a [[plough]].

From 1989 to 1992 Eisenman and his students conducted a walking survey of the entire [[Dead Sea]] shore and its environs from seven kilometers north of Qumran to thirty-five kilometers south, past [[Wadi Murabba'at]], to the northern limits of [[Ein Gedi]], mapping the whole area. In this survey they went into some 485 caves and depressions.&lt;ref&gt;“The 1988–92 California State University Dead Sea Walking Cave Survey and Radar Groundscan of the Qumran Cliffs,” ''The Quman Chronicle'', 9/2-4, December, 2000, p. 125; also see “The British had it all Wrong when Naming the Dead Sea,” Nick Tatro, AP, 2/2/90&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990–91, with the help of author [[Michael Baigent]]&lt;ref&gt;''Holy Blood, Holy Grail'', London and New York, 1982 and ''The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception'', London and New York, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[radar]] groundscan specialist Tony Wood, he conducted the first radar groundscan of the Qumran plateau, its ruins and, in particular, the top of the various [[marls]], including Caves 4–6 where he felt there was the best chance of finding hidden pockets that previously might not have been visible. Ground-scanning on the marls and below Cave VI did point to several such pockets and seemingly empty areas in the marls adjourning Cave IV.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Baigent and Robert Eisenman, “A Ground-Penetrating Radar Survey at Khirbat Qumran,” ''The Quman Chronicle'', 9/2-4, December, 2000, pp. 131–38&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:eisenman cave4.jpeg|right|thumb|300px|Photo: Prof. Eisenman on first Qumran Radar Ground-scan Expedition standing in face of Cave 4, 1990–91]]
In 2001–03, his teams joined an expedition led by Hanan Eshel and Magen Broshi and sponsored by John Merrill and the B.A.S. In the course of this expedition, two of his students, Dennis Walker and Ron Dubay, excavated a small building on the eastern edge of the Qumran Cemetery. They found that it contained bones: two secondary burials (and the next year one primary burial was uncovered beneath this).&lt;ref&gt;"Bones of Contention," ''Time Magazine'' 8/6/01, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year everyone went back to do more work on the enclosure and the bones it contained and to further survey the graveyard at Qumran, which evolved into the first comprehensive map of the Qumran settlement and adjacent cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;M. Broshi and H. Eshel, "Three Seasons of Excavations at Qumran," ''Journal of Roman Archaeology'', 17/1, 2004, pp. 321–332.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, they had the opportunity to return and investigate the empty areas in the marls of Cave IV, but with little result.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Kurtus, ''Investigating History: The Dead Sea Scrolls'', May, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Dead Sea Scrolls===
Eisenman claims that the preconceptions of the group of scholars around Father [[Roland De Vaux]] who first worked on the Dead Sea Scrolls led them to erroneously date the non-biblical, sectarian community documents to the [[Maccabean]] period, and to read them as the writings of a serene, retiring community of [[Essene]] [[monks]] exiled to the wilderness in the course of a dispute with the reigning priesthood of the day led by the "Wicked Priest"/"Spouter of Lying."&lt;ref&gt;See F. M. Cross, ''The Ancient Library of Qumran'', New York, 1961 and Eisenman, ''The New Testament Code'', pp. 3–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisenman reads the attitude of these documents as militant, nationalistic and zealous and places them not in the Maccabean period but the later, [[Herodian Dynasty|Herodian]] era (c. 35 BCE to 70 CE and beyond), which means the establishment priesthood that they opposed was the collaborating, compromising, corrupt Herodian priesthood. He sees parallels between the political, religious and ethical stance of these sectarian documents and that of [[James the brother of Jesus]], whom he identifies as the scrolls' [[Teacher of Righteousness]], and sees 'the [[Wicked Priest]]' and 'the Man of Lying' as two different adversaries of the scroll community, the Wicked Priest being the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] [[Ananus ben Ananus]], James' executioner, and the Man of Lying, [[St. Paul]].

He is critical of the ways [[radiocarbon dating]]  and [[paleography]] have been employed to date the Dead Sea Scrolls, and relies instead on his interpretation of the content of the scrolls despite this being at a clash with scientific consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Glenn. "Good Question......how well-respected are the theories of Eisenman, Allegro, Thiering, and Baigent &amp; Leigh concerning the Dead Sea Scrolls?" http://christianthinktank.com/iceman.html 12.April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He claims to find parallels between the James-[[Jesus]] first century milieu and the scrolls' repeated allusion to "the Star Prophecy", the aggressiveness of the [[War Scroll]] and similar documents, the hiding of the [[Jerusalem]] Temple treasure as delineated in the [[Copper Scroll]],&lt;ref&gt;''The New Testament Code''&lt;/ref&gt; the description of foreign armies (the ''[[Kittim]]'') invading on a much more massive scale than any [[Hellenistic]] invasion during the Maccabean period,&lt;ref&gt;''Maccabees, Zadokites, Christians and Qumran'', Leiden, 1984, pp. 24, 70, and 80 and ''James the Just in the Habakkuk Pesher'', Leiden, 1986, pp. 14–30 and 75–78.&lt;/ref&gt; and the reference to themselves several times as "the Congregation," "Church of the Poor" and [[Ebionites]] (“the Poor”), the name of James’ community as described in Early Church literature and by Paul.&lt;ref&gt;4QpPs 37ii.11 and iii.10&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenman lays particular emphasis on the scroll community's description of the Kittim's military and religious practices in their interpretation of [[Habakkuk]] 2:2–2:4 (the [[Habakkuk Commentary]]) as "sacrificing to their standards and worshiping their weapons of War", and their reference to [[Roman Empire|Roman]] “[[tax-farming]]” across the whole of the civilized world.&lt;ref&gt;''James the Just in the Habakkuk Pesher'', pp. 21–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interpretation of Habakkuk 2:4 at Qumran====
The recourse to an interpretation of Habakkuk 2:4 (“the Righteous shall live by his Faith”), the center piece and real building block of all [[Christian theology]] both in the Pauline corpus ([[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]], [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]], ''et al''.) and in the [[Epistle of James]] he sees as proof positive that these documents were written more or less contemporaneously and at a time when this [[prophecy]] or [[proof-text]] was in play.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Testament Code'', pp. 51–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, he sees the interpretation in the [[Habakkuk Commentary]] at Qumran, seemingly written in the latter part of the Community’s history and witnessing its fall and the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|fall of the Jerusalem Temple]] (c. 70 CE), as ‘Jamesian’ as opposed to ‘Pauline’.&lt;ref&gt;''James the Just in the Habakkuk Pesher'', Leiden, 1996, pp. vii–x, 32–42, and 99&lt;/ref&gt; That is, first of all it is confined to “Jews” or, in the language of the Commentary, “the House of Judah,” and second of all, it applies only to “Torah-doing” Jews (“doing” here, the basis of the [[Hebrew]] word for “works” throughout the Qumran corpus and also being an extremely important usage in the Epistle of James), that is, it does not apply to “non-Torah-doing Jews” and certainly not "non-Torah-doing Gentiles."&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Eisenman this is a direct riposte and a rejection of the Pauline interpretation of this prophecy, and the basis of the [[Pauline theology]] one finds in Galatians and Romans and actually, in fact, seemingly argued against in the extant Epistle of James whether seen as authentic, not authentic, or just part of ‘the Jamesian School’; and, therefore, Eisenman claims, a chronological indicator for the document as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Testament Code'', pp. 551–638 and 848–938.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, he points to the fact that there are even collections of messianic proof-texts at Qumran which include, for instance, the [[Star Prophecy]] of [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 24:17 which [[Josephus]], at the end of the [[The Wars of the Jews|Jewish War]], singles out as the reason for the outbreak of the revolt, and even one dedicated to “the Promises to the Seed” or “House of David.”&lt;ref&gt;4QTest i.9–13 and 4QFlor i.7–14.&lt;/ref&gt; For Eisenman the Dead Sea Scrolls are [[Jewish messianism|Messianic]], it being not properly appreciated just how messianic the Scrolls actually are. They represent "the literature of the Messianic Movement in Palestine" which he prefers to the usage “Christianity in Palestine".

Though, one might call them “[[Essene]]”, one must take the definition for this from what the Scrolls themselves say, not necessarily what others think or say the Essenes were. [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]], for instance, possibly preserving an alternate version of Josephus, thinks there are two or even three groups of “Essenes”, “[[Zealot]]” or “[[Sicarii]] Essenes”, and for Eisenman, this is a better definition of what the Essenes were than the more normative ones people are familiar with.&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus, ''Refutation of All Heresies'', 9,14–9.22 and ''The New Testament Code'', pp. 939–97.&lt;/ref&gt; For him the Essenes are what Christians were in Palestine before ‘the Movement’ went overseas and was Paulinized, turning it into the mirror opposite of what it was in Palestine before the fall of the Temple.

For him, [[Acts]] confirms this, averring that “Christians were first called Christians” in [[Antioch]] in [[Syria]] in the mid-Fifties AD.&lt;ref&gt;Acts 11:26.&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to this, he considers the more historically-oriented sectarian or later documents of the Dead Sea Scrolls to be the messianically inspired literature of a pietist, Law-oriented, and nationalistic Party in opposition to [[Roman Empire|Roman]]/[[Herodian Dynasty|Herodian]] rule in Palestine which uses the language as “Sons of [[Zadok]]” (in some vocabularies, “[[Sadducees]]”) or “''[[Zaddikim]]'' (צדיקים),” a derivate usage, in referring to itself or even “Messianic Sadducees”, as opposed to “Herodian Sadducees” pictured in both the [[New Testament]] and Josephus.

====Call for AMS carbon dating====

With his attempts to get free access to the Scrolls, Eisenman claims he was the first to call for AMS [[Carbon dating the Dead Sea Scrolls]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. M. Baigent and R. Leigh, ''The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception'', London/New York, 1991, pp. 80–83.&lt;/ref&gt; (the earliest carbon dating tests – non-AMS – were performed November 14, 1950 on a piece of linen from Qumran Cave 1, producing a date range being 167&amp;nbsp;BCE – 233&amp;nbsp;CE.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|authors=VanderKam, James C. &amp; Flint, Peter|title=The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco|location=New York|year=2002|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libby had first started using the dating method in 1946 and early testing required relatively large samples that were destroyed, so testing on scrolls only became feasible when methods used in the dating process were improved upon.&lt;ref&gt;Doudna, G. "Carbon-14 Dating", in ''Encyclopedia of the Dead Sea Scrolls'', Schiffman, Lawrence, &amp; VanderKam, James, eds., Vol.1 (Oxford: 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; [[F. E. Zeuner]] carried out tests on date palm wood from the Qumran site yielding a date range of 70&amp;nbsp;BCE – 90&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|authors=VanderKam, James C. &amp; Flint, Peter|title=The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco|location=New York|year=2002|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 Libby tested a sample from the Isaiah Scroll, which gave a range between 200&amp;nbsp;BCE – 1&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref&gt;Carmi, Israel, "Radiocarbon Dating of the Dead Sea Scrolls" in ''The Dead Sea Scrolls: Fifty Years after their Discovery. 1947–1997'', Schiffman, Lawrence, Tov, Emanuel, &amp; VanderKam, James, eds., (Jerusalem: IES, 2000) p.881.&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal was contained in a series of letters to [[John Strugnell]], Eisenman wrote with [[Philip R. Davies]] of [[Sheffield University]] in [[England]] and copied to [[Amir Drori]], the head of the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;Baigent and Leigh, ''Ibid''., 5/2/89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not two months after he and Davies made this request to the Antiquities Authority, to which they attached a recent article about AMS [[radiocarbon]] techniques, it announced its intention to run just such tests. Eisenman was not mentioned as having initiated the tests. He and Davies had included in their letter to the IAA a caveat, that "Opposition Scholars" be included in process because they claimed it was they who felt the most need for the tests and they who could identify which documents should be tested.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Testament Code'', pp. 44–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Eisenman and Davies were not included in the testing process. Eisenman disputes the findings of these tests.&lt;ref&gt;See Atwill, Braunheim, and Eisenman, Redating the Radio-Carbon Dating of the Dead Sea Scrolls, ''Dead Sea Discoveries'', 11/2/04, pp. 143–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===James===
{{Main|James the Brother of Jesus (book)}}
As far as Eisenman is concerned, [[James the Just]], the individual [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] actually refers to as either  "brother of Jesus" or “the brother of the Lord,”&lt;ref&gt;''James the Brother of Jesus'', Penguin, 1997–98, pp. 51–153 and 647–816.&lt;/ref&gt; is the historical character who exhibits the most in common with “the [[Teacher of Righteousness]]" pictured at Qumran and he considers that these events are the ones vividly portrayed in the Habakkuk Commentary. Historically speaking, it is this character who led the “Opposition Movement,” including Essenes, [[Zealots]], [[Sicarii]], and/or [[Nazoreans]] — even [[Ebionites]] — and who, as “[[Zaddik]]" (צדיק), i. e., “the ''Zaddik'' of the Opposition Movement,” about whom all these groups revolved until his death at the hands of the [[High Priest]] [[Ananus ben Ananus]] in 62 CE as described both in Josephus and Early Church literature.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' and Josephus, ''Antiquities'' 20.200 and Eusebius, ''Ecclesiastical History'' 2.23 and 4.22&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the popularity of James and the illegality of the manner of his death at the hands of the Herodians, establishment High Priesthood, and [[Pharisees]] in 62 CE set the stage for and possibly even triggered the [[First Jewish Revolt]] against the [[Rome]] in 66–73 CE — to say nothing of the fire in [[Rome]], not long afterwards which, aside from his probably having set it himself,{{dubious|date=September 2012}}{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} [[Nero]] was reported to have blamed on “Christians.”

For his part, the Jewish historian Josephus makes it clear that those he is calling “Essenes” (as opposed to these same [[Herodian Dynasty|Herodians]], [[Sadducees]], and [[Pharisees]]) participated in the uprising, willing to undergo any torture or any form of death rather than "eat things sacrificed to idols" or "break the Law."&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''War'' 2.151–3 and Hippolytus, ''Refutation'', 9.21&lt;/ref&gt; For Eisenman, these “[[Nazoreans]],” (נצרים) “[[Zealots]],” (קנאים) “''Zaddikim''” (צדיקים) or “''[[Ebionim]]''” (אביונים)  were marginalized by a Herodian named Saul ([[Paul of Tarsus]]) and the gentile Christians who followed him. This version of [[Christianity]], as it later emerged from a gentile milieu as led by Paul, transformed the apocalyptic militancy of the [[Ebionite]]/Essene ''Zaddikim'' into a universalist peaceful doctrine. In this manner, Eisenman sees the doctrine of [[Christianity]] as largely the product of Pauline [[dialectic]] and [[apologetics]]. In so doing, Eisenman attempts to recover the authentic teaching of Jesus and/or James from the obscurity into which it seems to have been intentionally cast by resultant orthodoxy. As he puts it at the end of ''James the Brother of Jesus'', once you have found the Historical James, you have found the [[Historical Jesus]] or alternatively, “who and whatever James was so too was Jesus”.&lt;ref&gt;''James the Brother of Jesus'', Penguin, 1998, p. 963.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paul as a Herodian===
Eisenman identifies [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] as a [[Herodians|Herodian]], calling attention to [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Paul's peculiar version of Judaism]]. A presentation seeming to represent the interests of the Herodian dynasty in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], as well as the intention to extend its influence into [[Asia Minor]] and further East into Northern [[Syria]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. He covered this in a series of papers and books beginning in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;''Maccabees, Zadokites, Christians and Qumran'', E. J. Brill, 1984, pp. 62–3 and 90–1 and “Paul as Herodian,” SBL, 1984, published in ''Journal of Higher Criticism'', iii, 1996, pp. 110–22 and ''The Dead Sea Scrolls and the First Christians'', 1996, pp. 226–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Offered as proof is Paul’s salutation (if authentic), at the end of the [[Letter to the Romans]], where he sends greetings to his “kinsman Herodion” (i. e., “the Littlest Herod”) and “all those in the Household of [[Aristobulus of Chalcis|Aristobulus]]” (the putative son of [[Herod of Chalcis]] and the ultimate husband of the infamous [[Salome]] – in fact, their son was “the Littlest Herod”).&lt;ref&gt;''The New Testament Code'', pp. 500–7 and cf. Romans 16:10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proof is also found in Josephus’ picture of a curious member of the Herodian family, an individual he also calls “Saulos” who shares many characteristics in common with “Paul” in [[New Testament]] portraiture. Not only was this “Saulos” involved in an appeal of sorts to “[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]],” he was also involved in violent behaviour in Jerusalem (although on the surface, at a somewhat later time); and it was he who made the final report to [[Nero]] in [[Corinth]] about the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Roman reverses in Jerusalem]] which resulted in the dispatch of his best general [[Vespasian]] from [[Great Britain|Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''The Jewish War'' 2.418, 556–58, and ''The Antiquities'', 20.214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally he found Herodian traces in Paul’s own outlook, his philosophy of “winning“ or being a “Jew to the Jews, a Law-keeper to the Law-keeper and a Law-breaker to the Law-breaker” also expressed in [[I Corinthians]] 9:19–27. In his own identification of himself as of “the [[Tribe of Benjamin]]” ([[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 11:1 and [[Philippians]] 3:5), a claim he might have felt Herodians, as [[Edomites|Idumeans]], were making for themselves, and his founding “a Community where [[Greeks]] and Jews could live in harmony, etc.,” where there were “no foreign visitors,” as well as in the easy access he seems to have had to positions of power, and his own Roman citizenship.

Rounding out his arguments, Eisenman cites the matter of an unidentified “nephew” of Paul—seemingly the son of Paul’s sister, resident in Jerusalem (Cypros married to the Temple Treasurer Helcias? – see the genealogies &lt;ref&gt;''The New Testament Code'', pp. 1010–11 and ''James the Brother of Jesus'', pp. 968–69.&lt;/ref&gt;). This “nephew” has unfettered entrée to the Commander of the Roman [[garrison]] in the [[Tower of Antonia]] who, in turn, saves Paul from “[[Nazirite]] oath-taking” “[[Zealot]]”-like Jewish extremists who take an oath “not to eat or drink till they have killed Paul” (Acts 23:12–35). Eisenman identifies this individual as Julius Archelaus, the son of Saulos’ sister, Cypros. Finally, consider Paul's Roman citizenship; the philosophy of paying the Roman tax to Caesar; and placing the [[Roman Law]] above the [[Jewish Law]] as an expression of “the Righteousness Commandment” of [[Great Commandment|“loving your neighbor as yourself”]] (Romans 13:1–10).

===First to call the James Ossuary fraudulent===
Eisenman was the first to publicly claim that the [[James Ossuary]] was fraudulent when it originally surfaced in October, 2002 and he did this on the first day it appeared in news articles from [[Associated Press|AP]] and op-ed pieces as in the [[Los Angeles Times]]&lt;ref&gt;”A Discovery That’s Just too Perfect,” Los Angeles Times, October 29th, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of what the inscription actually said and not on the basis of ‘scientific’ or ‘pseudo-scientific aids like those of [[palaeography]] or [[patina]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenman, ''The New Testament Code'', London/New York, 2006, pp. 56–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first place, when he actually saw the [[ossuary]] at the AAR/[[Society of Biblical Literature|SBL]] Conference in [[Toronto]] three weeks later, it was clear there were two separate hands on the [[inscription]], the second patently more cursive. Secondly, even if the “Jacob the Son of Joseph” part were authentic (there being plenty of ossuaries of this kind available around Jerusalem), the second “Brother of Jesus” part would have to have been added a substantial amount of time later, either in antiquity by a pious pilgrim or in modern times, by a not-very-sophisticated forger because at the time (62 CE), Jesus – if he existed as such — would have been no more well known in Jerusalem than his putative brother James, and probably far less so; so there would have been no need to add such a rare [[cognomen]] except to please believers.

Moreover, as he said in his [[Los Angeles Times]] op ed of 10/29/02, he would have been much more impressed if the first part of the [[inscription]] had said “son of Clopas’/‘Cleophas’/‘[[Saint Peter|Cephas]]’ or some such thing, which is how individuals connected to this family were known in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in this period and not the more pat or theologically-consistent “Joseph”; or if the second part had simply added the cognomen “the ''Zaddik''” (הׂצדיק) or “Just One,” which was also how James was known by everyone in Palestine at this time according to [[Eusebius]].&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius quoting Hegesippus, ''Ecclesiastical History'', 2.23.4–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roger Carl Schank''' (born 1946) is an American [[artificial intelligence]] theorist, [[cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologist]], [[learning sciences|learning scientist]], educational reformer, and [[entrepreneur]].

Beginning in the late 1960s, he pioneered [[conceptual dependency theory]] (within the context of [[natural language understanding]]) and [[case-based reasoning]], both of which challenged [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] views of memory and reasoning.

In 1989, Schank was granted $30 million in a 10-year commitment to his research and development by [[Andersen Consulting]], through which he founded the Institute for the Learning Sciences (ILS) at [[Northwestern University]] in Chicago.

==Academic career==
For his undergraduate degree, Schank studied mathematics at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]&lt;ref name="shank_tank"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Freedman|first1=David|title=The Schank Tank|url=https://www.wired.com/1994/08/schank/|website=Wired|publisher=Wired|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh PA]], and later was awarded a PhD in [[linguistics]] at the [[University of Texas]] in Austin and went on to work in faculty positions at [[Stanford University]] and then at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name=freedman&gt;{{Cite news| volume = 2| issue = 8| last = Freedman| first = David H.| title = The Schank Tank| work = Wired| accessdate = 2011-10-04| date = August 1994| url = https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.08/schank_pr.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, he became professor of [[computer science]] and [[psychology]] at Yale University. In 1981, Schank became Chairman of Computer Science at Yale and director of the Yale Artificial Intelligence Project.&lt;ref name=bio1&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography: Part 1 of 2|work=RogerSchank.com|url=http://www.rogerschank.com/biography.html|year=2009|accessdate=October 9, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006130700/http://www.rogerschank.com/biography.html|archivedate=October 6, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Schank was granted $30 million in a 10-year commitment to his research and development by [[Accenture|Andersen Consulting]], allowing him to leave Yale and set up the Institute for the Learning Sciences (ILS) at [[Northwestern University]] in Chicago, bringing along 25 of his Yale colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Glenn|last=Rifkin|title= Andersen Consulting's Culture of 'Clones'|work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/06/business/andersen-consulting-s-culture-of-clones.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|date=September 6, 1992|accessdate= September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ILS attracted other corporate sponsors such as [[IBM]] and [[Ameritech]], as well as government sponsors such as the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] and the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]],&lt;ref name=bio2 /&gt; leading to a focus on the development of educational software,&lt;ref name=freedman /&gt; especially in employee training.&lt;ref name=bio2&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography: Part 2 of 2|work=RogerSchank.com|url=http://www.rogerschank.com/biography-part2.html|year=2009|accessdate=October 9, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006151508/http://www.rogerschank.com/biography-part2.html|archivedate=October 6, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ILS was later absorbed by the School of Education as a separate department.

When Carnegie Mellon University's [[Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley|Silicon Valley campus]] was established in 2002, Schank came to serve as Chief Educational Officer at the institution.&lt;ref name=socratic /&gt;

==Entrepreneurship==
While at Yale in 1979, Schank was among the first to "capitalize on the expected boom"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Pollack|work= New York Times|title=Selling artificial intelligence |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/13/business/selling-artificial-intelligence.html|date=September 13, 1982|accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in AI when he founded Cognitive Systems, a company that went public in 1986. Schank resigned as chairman and chief executive in 1988 for personal reasons, but stayed as a board member and advisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top officer resigns at Cognitive Systems|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/24/business/business-people-top-officer-resigns-at-cognitive-systems.html|date=June 24, 1988|accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Schank founded Cognitive Arts Corporation&lt;ref name=socratic&gt;{{cite web|title=Roger Schank|work=Socratic Arts |url=http://www.socraticarts.com/about.cfm?lead=Roger-Schank|accessdate=October 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (originally named Learning Sciences Corporation) to market the software developed at ILS, and led the company until it was sold in 2003.

From 2005 to 2007, Schank was the chief learning officer of Trump University.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/trump-university-i-state-accreditation-issue-roger-schank&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 he founded Socratic Arts, a company that sells e-learning software to both businesses and schools.&lt;ref name=bio2 /&gt;

In 2008, Schank built a story-centered curriculum (SCC) at the Business Engineering School of La Salle International Graduate School of [[Ramon Llull University]], Barcelona to teach MBA students to launch their own businesses or to go to work.&lt;ref name=bio2 /&gt;

In 2012, Schank founded XTOL (Experiential Training Online) which "designs learn-by-doing experiential short courses for use by universities, corporations and professional organizations, as well as Master's programs in partnership with degree-granting universities around the world."&lt;ref name=xtol&gt;{{cite web|title=XTOL (Experiential Training Online)|url=http://www.xtolcorp.com/|accessdate=January 21, 2014| website=XTOL Corp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational reform==
Schank believes that the educational system is fundamentally broken and that software will need to replace conventional teaching methods.&lt;ref name=green&gt;{{cite news|first=Joshua|last=Green|title=No Lectures or Teachers, Just Software|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20000811friday.html| date=August 11, 2000|accessdate=October 10, 2011|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; To serve this purpose, he founded Engines for Education in 2001, a not-for-profit organization which designs and implements curricula for primary and secondary schools&lt;ref name=bio2 /&gt; and hosts the Virtual International Science and Technology Academy (VISTA).

==Influence==
Schank was a leading pioneer of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive psychology]] in the 1970s and 1980s. His innovations in these fields were [[conceptual dependency theory]] and [[case-based reasoning]], both of which challenged [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] views of memory and reasoning.

In 1969 Schank introduced the [[conceptual dependency theory]] for [[natural language understanding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| pages = 1–3| last = Schank| first = Roger| title = A conceptual dependency parser for natural language| booktitle =  Proceedings of the 1969 conference on Computational linguistics| location = Sång-Säby, Sweden| year = 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model, partly based on the work of [[Sydney Lamb]], was extensively used by Schank's students at [[Yale University]], such as [[Robert Wilensky]], Wendy Lehnert, and [[Janet Kolodner]].

Case-based reasoning (CBR) is based on Schank's model of dynamic memory&lt;ref name="ref_schank"&gt;Roger Schank, Dynamic Memory: ''A Theory of Learning in Computers and People'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; and was the basis for the earliest CBR systems: [[Janet Kolodner|Janet Kolodner's]] CYRUS&lt;ref name="ref_kolodner"&gt;Janet Kolodner, "Reconstructive Memory: A Computer Model," ''Cognitive Science'' 7 (1983): 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and Michael Lebowitz's IPP.&lt;ref name="ref_lebowitz"&gt;Michael Lebowitz, "Memory-Based Parsing," ''Artificial Intelligence'' 21 (1983), 363-404.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other schools of CBR and closely allied fields emerged in the 1980s, investigating such topics as CBR in legal reasoning, memory-based reasoning (a way of reasoning from examples on massively parallel machines), and combinations of CBR with other reasoning methods.  In the 1990s, interest in CBR grew, as evidenced by the establishment of an International Conference on Case-Based Reasoning in 1995, as well as European, German, British, Italian, and other CBR workshops.

CBR technology has produced a number of successful deployed systems, the earliest being Lockheed's CLAVIER,&lt;ref name="ref_mark"&gt;Bill Mark, "Case-Based Reasoning for Autoclave Management," ''Proceedings of the Case-Based Reasoning Workshop'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; a system for laying out composite parts to be baked in an industrial convection oven. CBR has been used extensively in [[help desk]] applications such as the Compaq SMART system&lt;ref name="ref_nguyen"&gt;Trung Nguyen, Mary Czerwinski, and Dan Lee, "COMPAQ QuickSource: Providing the Consumer with the Power of Artificial Intelligence," in ''Proceedings of the Fifth Annual Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence'' (Washington, DC: AAAI Press, 1993), 142-151.&lt;/ref&gt; and has found a major application area in the health sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2071862| issn = 1094-6977| volume = 41| issue = 4| pages = 421–434| last = Begum| first = S.|author2=M.

[[File:SaganWalk.Map.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the Planet Walk]]
The Sciencenter's '''Sagan Planet Walk''' is a walkable [[solar system model|scale model]] of the [[Solar System]], located in [[Ithaca, New York]]. The model scales the entire Solar System—both planet size and distances between them—down to one five billionth of its actual size. Consisting of eleven obelisks situated along a {{Convert|1.18|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=on|sp=us}} path through the streets of downtown Ithaca, the Planet Walk leads from the [[Sun]] at [[Ithaca Commons|Center Ithaca]] to Pluto at the [[sciencenter|Ithaca Sciencenter]]. 

The exhibition was originally created in 1997 in memory of Ithaca resident and [[Cornell]] Professor [[Carl Sagan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sagan Planet Walk|url=http://www.sciencenter.org/SaganPW/|accessdate=19 November 2012|work=Ithaca Sciencenter|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205135839/http://www.sciencenter.org/saganpw/|archivedate=5 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the model was expanded {{Convert|4740|mi|km|abbr=out|disp=flip|sp=us}} to include a representation of [[Alpha Centauri]], the Sun's closest neighboring star, at the ‘[[Imiloa Astronomy Center of Hawaii|Imiloa Astronomy Center at the University of Hawaii]]. The addition of the Alpha Centauri Obelisk made it the world's largest exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Couillard|first=Sherri|title=Sagan Planet Walk Expands to Hawaii|url=http://cornellsun.com/node/53167|accessdate=19 November 2012|work=Cornell Daily Sun|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311192420/http://cornellsun.com/node/53167|archivedate=11 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelley|first=Susan|title=Sagan Planet Walk, now the world's largest exhibition, extends to Hawai'i|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Sept12/PlanetWalk.html|work=Chronicle Online|accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the inner planets and Sun were removed as part of extensive construction being done to the [[Ithaca Commons]], but have since been replaced. In 2015, a grant was approved to further expand the exhibition by installing an exoplanet [[Kepler-37d]] station on the Moon {{Convert|238900|mi|km|abbr=out|sp=us|disp=flip}} away.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tompkinscountyny.gov/files/tourism/4_15_15_STPB_agenda_PACKET_full.pdf|title=Tompkins County Strategic Tourism Planning Board|last=|first=|date=April 15, 2015|website=Tompkins County NY|publisher=|access-date=March 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual models==
The scaled size of the Sun is given by a {{Convert|27.8|cm|in|abbr=on|adj=on}} diameter circular frame repeated at the top of each {{Convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=on|sp=us}} tall obelisk. Centered within each sun-sized frame, the proportional size of each planet is represented by a small sphere affixed in a glass window. All of the original planet locations were chosen not only for accuracy to scale but also to highlight local landmarks and public spaces within Ithaca. However, since the original installation of the Planet Walk the public library has moved to a new location, leaving Saturn no longer attached to a local landmark. Additionally, as of 2016-2017, the original planets in plexiglass at each station have been replaced by simple yellow disks with the planet simply represented by a relatively-sized hole.  Some attendant moons are now represented by tiny holes in the disks.

===The Sun===
The Sun Obelisk is located in the center of the [[Ithaca Commons]], a pedestrian shopping area in the heart of downtown Ithaca. The round window representing the size of the Sun at this station is roughly the size of a basketball and, in this obelisk only, contains no glass. All the subsequent obelisks in the Solar system model have Sun-sized glass windows containing their respective planets for the sake of comparison.

===The Inner Planets===
The obelisks for the four inner planets are all contained within the commons area stretching north towards Seneca Street. Mercury is situated to scale about {{Convert|12.7|yd|m|abbr=off|sp=us|adj=off}} away from the Sun, Venus another {{Convert|10|yd|m|abbr=off|adj=off|sp=us}} away, Earth another {{Convert|9.3|yd|m|abbr=off|sp=us|adj=off}} away, and Mars another {{Convert|17.1|yd|m|abbr=off|sp=us|adj=off}} away. This keeps the four inner planets within eyesight of the Sun, yet the representations of each planet appear quite small within their glass windows, and can even be somewhat hard to see. The contrast between the size of the Sun and the size of the inner planets coupled with the visible distance between them illustrate the vastness and emptiness of space.

=== The Asteroid Belt ===
[[File:SaganWalk.4.5.AsteroidBelt.jpg|thumb|right|The Asteroid Belt]]
Once leaving the inner planets, a visitor to the Planet Walk turns west along Seneca Street to continue towards Jupiter. Between Mars and Jupiter lies the asteroid belt. The obelisk representing the asteroid belt was added several years after the initial installation. Its display contains the only public, unguarded meteorite in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nocella|first=Michael|title=When Big Is Walkable: Sciencenter’s Sagan Planet Walk|url=http://www.ithaca.com/visit_ithaca/article_cd5c7c46-b57f-11e1-8585-0019bb2963f4.html|accessdate=19 November 2012|work=Ithaca Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jupiter===
The Jupiter Obelisk sits at the corner of Seneca and Cayuga streets, outside the downtown Dewitt Mall, and not far from the famed [[Moosewood Restaurant]]. The model of Jupiter within the glass window is the first planet representation on the walk that is easily visible, demonstrating how much bigger than the inner planets it is.

===Saturn===
To reach the Saturn Obelisk, visitors turn north and continue along Cayuga street. At the corner of Cayuga and Court street, Saturn's obelisk sits outside the former location of the [[Tompkins County Public Library]]. The rings of Saturn are clearly visible within the circular window.

===Uranus===
Visitors continue northward along Cayuga street from Saturn, reaching the obelisk for Uranus just across Cascadilla Creek at the entrance to Thompson Park.

===Neptune and the Carl Sagan Bridge===
[[File:SaganWalk.8.5.Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|The Carl Sagan Bridge with planet symbols]]
From Uranus, visitors follow Willow Avenue northwest and cross the Carl Sagan bridge at Adams street to reach the Neptune Obelisk. The Carl Sagan Bridge, built in 2000, features nine circular windows adorned with the signs of the nine planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brand|first=David|title=Cornell undergrads salute Sagan and technology by building bridge from new, lightweight material|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Nov99/petrina.fibers.deb.html|accessdate=19 November 2012|work=Cornell News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The obelisk for Neptune is located just across the bridge in Conley Park.

===Pluto and the Sciencenter===
The Planet Walk was conceived and built prior to Pluto losing its planetary status in 2006, and the model includes the Pluto Obelisk, which is located just outside the Sciencenter on First street.

===Alpha Centauri===
The model was expanded {{Convert|4740|mi|km|abbr=out|disp=flip|sp=us}} in 2012 to include [[Alpha Centauri]], the star closest to the Sun. The Alpha Centauri Obelisk is exhibited at the ‘[[Imiloa Astronomy Center of Hawaii|‘Imiloa Astronomy Center of Hawai‘i]] at the [[University of Hawaii]] in Hilo, Hawaii. This extension made the Sagan Planet Walk the world's largest exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Couillard|first=Sherri|title=Sagan Planet Walk Expands to Hawaii|url=http://cornellsun.com/node/53167|accessdate=19 November 2012|work=Cornell Daily Sun|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311192420/http://cornellsun.com/node/53167|archivedate=11 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelley|first=Susan|title=Sagan Planet Walk, now the world's largest exhibition, extends to Hawai'i|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Sept12/PlanetWalk.html|work=Chronicle Online|accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sauropod neck posture''' is a subject occasionally debated among scientists, with some favoring postures closer to horizontal whilst others a more upright posture. Research has looked at various avenues of evidence and analysis including: attempting to reconstruct the neutral posture of their necks and estimating range of motion by studying the bones; attempting to reconstruct sauropod metabolism and the energy requirements of sustaining incredibly long necks in various postures; and comparing sauropod neck anatomy to those of living animals.&lt;ref name="pose2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = M. P. | last2 = Wedel | first2 = M. J. | last3 = Naish | first3 = D. | doi = 10.4202/app.2009.0007 | title = Head and neck posture in sauropod dinosaurs inferred from extant animals | journal = Acta Palaeontologica Polonica | volume = 54 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–220| year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seymour" /&gt;

== Biomechanics ==

The biomechanics of sauropod skeletons and necks can help determine at what angle the neck was positioned.&lt;ref name="uprightsauropods"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Christian | first1 = A. | authorlink1 = Andreas Christian | last2 = | first2 =  | year = 2010 | title = Some sauropods raised their necks–evidence for high browsing in ''Euhelopus zdanskyi'' | journal = Biology Letters | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 823–825 | publisher = Royal Society | jstor =  | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2010.0359 | pmc = 3001369 | url = http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2010/05/29/rsbl.2010.0359.full | format =  | accessdate = | pmid=20519198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flexibility ===
In 2013, a study led by Matthew J. Cobley and published in [[PLOS ONE]] focused on the flexibility of the necks of sauropods. They compared the necks of [[ostrich]]es with sauropod genera to find out how flexible the necks really were. The study noted that previous biomechanics studies found the necks to have been positioned between the extremes of a vertical, and a downward slanted neck. In conclusion, the study found that sauropod neck flexibility should not be based on osteology alone, and if it is, the results should be used with caution. Even though there is a lack of preserved muscle tissue that would determine flexibility, sauropod necks were probably less flexible than previously thought.&lt;ref name="plosbio"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0072187| title = Inter-Vertebral Flexibility of the Ostrich Neck: Implications for Estimating Sauropod Neck Flexibility| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 8| issue = 8| pages = e72187| year = 2013| last1 = Cobley | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Rayfield | first2 = E. J. | last3 = Barrett | first3 = P. M. | pmid=23967284 | pmc=3743800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Mike P. Taylor]] analysed the flexibility in the necks of ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' and ''[[Diplodocus]]''. He found that Cobley ''et al.'' was incorrect in the fact that vertebrae imply the neck is less flexible than in actuality. Cobley ''et al.'' found necks to be much less flexible than in reality when cartilage was added. It was found that the cartilage between the joints would have allowed for the neck to flex far past 90°. However, Taylor noted that while the neck could flex above the vertical, the osteological neutral pose would have been around horizontal, with the habitual pose having the head held upwards in an alert pose.&lt;ref name="taylor14"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=M.P.|year=2014|title=Quantifying the effect of intervertebral cartilage on the neutral posture in the necks of sauropod dinosaurs|url=https://peerj.com/articles/712/|journal=PeerJ|volume=2|pages=e712|doi=10.7717/peerj.712|pmid=25551027|pmc=4277489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Muscling ===

Sauropod necks were probably highly muscled to suit their feeding level. ''[[Brachiosaurus brancai]]'' (now ''[[Giraffititan]]'') was probably a high browser, so it would have been more muscled along the neck than other sauropods like ''Diplodocus'' and ''Dicraeosaurus'' who were low browsers. The tail and limb length of ''B. brancai'' would also need to be greater, to balance out the inclined neck.&lt;ref name="neckmuscles"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Christian | first1 = Andreas | last2 = | first2 =  | year = 2008 | title = Neck posture and overall body design in sauropods | journal = Fossil Record | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 271–281 | publisher = Wiley | jstor =  | doi = 10.1002/mmng.20020050116 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mmng.20020050116/abstract | format =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the question of whether sauropods were [[endothermic]] or [[ectothermic]] plays a major part in how sauropods were muscled, as endotherms have particularly more intestines and stomach than ectotherms.

=== Heart and metabolic stress ===

The previous upright posture of sauropod necks would require great blood pressure and a strong heart. One 2000 study conducted by Roger Seymour and Harvey Lillywhite found that the blood pressure needed to reach the head with an upright neck would be {{convert|700|mmHg|inHg}}. This could be fatal to an endotherm, and also highly dangerous to an ectotherm. If sauropods were endothermic metabolically, it would certainly be impossible for them to survive with upright necks, as the blood pressure would be too high to live even with thicker heart muscling.&lt;ref name="seymour"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2000.1225| title = Hearts, neck posture and metabolic intensity of sauropod dinosaurs| journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences| volume = 267| issue = 1455| pages = 1883–7| year = 2000| last1 = Seymour | first1 = R. S.| last2 = Lillywhite | first2 = H. B. | pmid=11052540 | pmc=1690760}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later study by Seymour concluded that it would have required half the energy of any particular sauropod to pump the blood to the head. This would lower the probability of sauropods being high browsers, and instead having lower necks while feeding than commonly portrayed.&lt;ref name="seymour2"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2009.0096| pmid = 19364714| title = Raising the sauropod neck: It costs more to get less| journal = Biology Letters| volume = 5| issue = 3| pages = 317–9| year = 2009| last1 = Seymour | first1 = R.

== Hypotheses ==
[[File:Opisthocoelicaudia posture.svg|thumb|Restored posture of ''Opisthocoelicaudia'' from the original description (A),&lt;ref name="borsuk-bialynicka_1977"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borsuk-Białynicka|first=M.M.|year=1977|title=A new camarasaurid sauropod Opisthocoelicaudia skarzynskii gen. n., sp. n. from the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia|journal=Palaeontologia Polonica|series=37|pages=5–64|url=http://www.palaeontologia.pan.pl/Archive/1977-37_5-64_1-14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Schwartz ''et al.'' (B)&lt;ref name="schwartz"/&gt;]]
A few hypotheses have been generated to solve the dispute over how sauropods held their necks.&lt;ref name="pose2009"/&gt;

=== Horizontal pose ===
Kent Stevens and Michael Parrish are the two main supporters of a horizontal neck posture. In 1999, they studied the genera ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' and ''[[Diplodocus]]'', finding the habitual pose of the genera to be slightly declined. They claimed that both sauropods had necks much less flexible than previously thought, with the neck vertebrae of ''Diplodocus'' being more inflexible than ''Apatosaurus''. Those two poses would suggest that the sauropods were ground feeders, instead of browsing off taller flora.&lt;ref name="parrish1999"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.284.5415.798| title = Neck Posture and Feeding Habits of Two Jurassic Sauropod Dinosaurs| journal = Science| volume = 284| issue = 5415| pages = 798–800| year = 1999| last1 = Stevens | first1 = K. A. | pmid=10221910}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Later, in 2005, Stevens and Parrish again studied the biomechanics of sauropod necks, but this time on a wider variety of sauropods, those inhabiting the Jurassic. Specifically, ''Apatosaurus'', ''Diplodocus'', ''[[Camarasaurus]]'', ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'', ''[[Dicraeosaurus]]'', ''[[Cetiosaurus]]'', and ''[[Euhelopus]]'' were studied, and each and every one was stated to have a horizontally held neck by Stevens and Parrish. The pair even went as far a saying that all but a few had necks that curved downward towards the head.&lt;ref name="parrish2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stevens|first=K.A.|authorlink=Kent Stevens|last2=Parrish|first2=M.J.|authorlink2=Michael Parrish|year=2005|chapter=Neck Posture, Dentition, and Feeding Strategies in Jurassic Sauropod Dinosaurs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMnKDusJuYUC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=Sauropod+neck+posture+Parrish+2005#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|editor-last=Tidwell|editor-first=Virginia|editor-link=Virginia Tidwell|editor2-last=Carpenter|editor2-first=Kenneth|editor2-link=Kenneth Carpenter|title=Thunder-lizards: The Sauropodomorph Dinosaurs|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|pages=212–232|isbn=0-253-34542-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2009 multiple things were found to be incorrect with this hypothesis. Michael P. Taylor ''et al.'' compared the neck posture of sauropods to that of extant [[reptiles]], finding the habitual pose of different sauropods to be quite different from the hypothesis of Stevens and Parrish, including an upright neck for ''Diplodocus''. The inaccuracies of Stevens and Parrish come mostly from their thought about the habitual pose, which was, according to them, the Osteological Neutral Pose (or ONP) of every sauropod. Taylor ''et al.'' find the ONP not to be the habitual pose, far from it, but just the midpoint between the two structural extremes of the neck orientation.&lt;ref name="pose2009"/&gt;

=== Incline pose ===
Another, more widely supported hypothesis about sauropod neck posture is that the necks were held at an incline, but not as upright as commonly shown.&lt;ref name="pose2009"/&gt; Daniela Schwartz ''et al.'' in 2006 published a study of the scapula and coracoids, sometimes fused into scapulocoracoids, of sauropod genera. Previously, sauropod shoulder girdles were thought to have been positioned horizontally along the torso, but Schwartz ''et al.'' found that the girdles should not have been positioned horizontally, and instead, they would have been angled at an average of 55° to 65°. The study reconstructed the skeletons of ''Diplodocus'', ''Camarasaurus'', and the titanosaur ''[[Opisthocoelicaudia]]'', all known from a complete shoulder girdle, with the correct orientation of the scapulocoracoids. For ''Diplodocus'', a 60° shoulder blade would have meant that the neck was more-or-less horizontal,&lt;ref name="schwartz"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ar.20405| title = Novel reconstruction of the orientation of the pectoral girdle in sauropods| journal = The Anatomical Record| volume = 290| pages = 32–47| year = 2007| last1 = Schwarz| first1 = Daniela| last2 = Frey| first2 = Eberhard| last3 = Meyer| first3 = Christian A.| pmid=17441196}}&lt;/ref&gt; not too much different from the horizontal pose.&lt;ref name="parrish1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="parrish2005"/&gt; A juvenile ''Camarasaurus'' found by Gilmore was originally described as having the scapulocoracoid in "just the right place", but with it oriented at an angle of 45°, Schwartz ''et al.'' criticized the stance. The skeleton found by Schwartz ''et al.'' with the angle of the scapulocoracoid is similar to previous reconstruction of the genus by Osborn and Mook, and Jensen. ''Opisthocoelicaudia'' was found to have had two possibly poses, both with the scapulocoracoid angled at about 60°. No previous reconstructions, unlike with ''Camarasaurus'', have restored ''Opisthocoelicaudia'' similarly.&lt;ref name="schwartz"/&gt;

=== Upright pose for some sauropods ===
''Euhelopus'' and ''Brachiosaurus'' have been found to be among only a few sauropods to hold their necks at a vertical angle, which would have been impossible for other sauropods. Many studies have stated that the blood pressure and energy spent would have been too great to survive, but for ''Euhelopus'' and ''Brachiosaurus'' it would have suited them better. The energy spent by pumping blood to the head would probably be too great for sauropods, but when they travel often, which has been suggested for those two genera, it would have actually saved energy. The biomechanical evidence favours an upright neck when travelling to spread apart resources. The study finding this conclusion also tested how much energy would have been expended when walking {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} and standing, both with an upright neck. The approximate conclusion was that an about equal amount of energy would have been used up. Elongated cervical ribs are skeletal evidence for a strong core to support the neck and limit its movement when walking. The study supports the idea that during times of drought and famine, an upright neck was crucial for these sauropods to survive.&lt;ref name="uprightsauropods"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13874">'''Scientific consensus''' is the collective judgment, position, and opinion of the [[scientific community|community]] of [[scientist]]s in a [[Scientific discipline|particular field]] of study. Consensus implies general agreement, though not necessarily unanimity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenfacts.org/glossary/abc/consensus.htm|title=Scientific Consensus|publisher=Green Facts|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consensus]] is normally achieved through communication  at conferences, the  publication process, replication (reproducible results by others), and [[peer review]]. These lead to a situation in which those within the discipline can often recognize such a consensus where it exists, but communicating to outsiders that consensus has been reached can be difficult, because the 'normal' debates through which science progresses may seem to outsiders as contestation.&lt;ref name="Shwed and Bearman 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Shwed Uri|author2=Peter Bearman|url=http://asr.sagepub.com/content/75/6/817.full.pdf+html|title=The Temporal Structure of Scientific Consensus Formation|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=75|issue=6|date=December 2010|pages=817–40|accessdate=18 December 2010|ref=harv|doi=10.1177/0003122410388488|pmc=3163460 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion, scientific institutes issue position statements intended to communicate a summary of the science from the "inside" to the "outside" of the scientific community. In cases where there is little controversy regarding the subject under study, establishing what the consensus is can be quite straightforward.

Scientific consensus may be invoked in popular or political debate on subjects that are controversial within the public sphere but which may not be controversial within the scientific community, such as [[evolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Statement on the Teaching of Evolution|url=http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/pdf/0219boardstatement.pdf |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |date=2006-02-16 |accessdate=2008-05-02|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=NSTA Position Statement: The Teaching of Evolution|url=http://www.nsta.org/about/positions/evolution.aspx|publisher=National Science Teacher Association |accessdate=2008-05-02|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientific opinion on climate change#Scientific consensus|climate change]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalacademies.org/onpi/06072005.pdf "Joint Science Academies' Statement"]&lt;/ref&gt; or the lack of a link between [[MMR vaccine controversy|MMR vaccinations and autism]].&lt;ref name="Shwed and Bearman 2010" /&gt;

== Change of consensus over time ==
{{See also|Theories and sociology of the history of science}}
There are many philosophical and historical theories as to how scientific consensus changes over time. Because the history of scientific change is extremely complicated, and because there is a tendency to project "winners" and "losers" onto the past in relation to our ''current'' scientific consensus, it is very difficult to come up with accurate and rigorous models for scientific change.&lt;ref name="Pickering 1993"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Pickering| first= Andrew| authorlink=Andrew Pickering |title = The Mangle of Practice | year = 1995 |publisher = Chicago University Press | location = IL | isbn = 0-226-66802-9 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is made exceedingly difficult also in part because each of the various branches of science functions in somewhat different ways with different forms of evidence and experimental approaches.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Most models of scientific change rely on new data produced by scientific [[experiment]]. [[Karl Popper]] proposed that since no amount of experiments could ever ''prove'' a scientific theory, but a single experiment could ''disprove'' one, science should be based on [[falsifiability|falsification]].&lt;ref name="PopperLSR"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Popper| first= Karl Raimund| authorlink=Karl Popper |title = The Logic of Scientific Discovery | year = 1934 | edition = 2002| publisher = Routledge Classics | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-415-27844-7 | ref=harv }} Originally published in German as {{cite book |title=Logik der Forschung: zur Erkenntnistheorie der modenen Naturwissenschaft |series=Schriften zur Wissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung |year=1935 |publisher=Springer | location=Vienna |oclc=220936200|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst this forms a logical theory for science, it is in a sense "timeless" and does not necessarily reflect a view on how science should progress over time.

Among the most influential challengers of this approach was [[Thomas Kuhn]], who argued instead that experimental [[data]] always provide some data which cannot fit completely into a theory, and that falsification alone did not result in scientific change or an undermining of scientific consensus. He proposed that scientific consensus worked in the form of "[[paradigm]]s", which were interconnected theories and underlying assumptions about the nature of the theory itself which connected various researchers in a given field. Kuhn argued that only after the accumulation of many "significant" anomalies would scientific consensus enter a period of "crisis". At this point, new theories would be sought out, and eventually one paradigm would triumph over the old one – a series of [[paradigm shift]]s rather than a linear progression towards truth. Kuhn's model also emphasized more clearly the social and personal aspects of theory change, demonstrating through historical examples that scientific consensus was never truly a matter of pure logic or pure facts.&lt;ref name="KuhnSSR"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Kuhn| first= Thomas S. |title=[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]] |year = 1962 | edition = 1996| pages=| publisher = University of Chicago Press, Chicago| isbn = 978-0-226-45808-3 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these periods of 'normal' and 'crisis' science are not mutually exclusive. Research shows that these are different modes of practice, more than different historical periods.&lt;ref name="Shwed and Bearman 2010" /&gt;

==Perception and public opinion==
Perception of whether a scientific consensus exists on a given issue, and how strong that conception is, has been described as a "gateway belief" upon which other beliefs and then action are based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Scientists are from Mars, Laypeople are from Venus: An Evidence-Based Rationale for Communicating the Consensus on Climate|journal=Reports of the National Center for Science Education|date=November-December 2014|volume=34|issue=6|url=http://reports.ncse.com/index.php/rncse/article/viewFile/347/599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politicization of science ==
{{Main article|Politicization of science}}

In public policy debates, the assertion that there exists a consensus of scientists in a particular field is often used as an argument for the validity of a theory and as support for a course of action by those who stand to gain from a policy based on that consensus. Similarly arguments for a ''lack'' of scientific consensus are often encouraged by sides who stand to gain from a more ambiguous policy.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

For example, the [[scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus on the causes of global warming]] is that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused primarily by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref name="OreskesBeyondTheIvoryTower"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Oreskes| first = Naomi| authorlink = Naomi Oreskes| title = Beyond the Ivory Tower: The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change| journal = Science| volume = 306| page = 1686| date = December 2004| url =http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5702/1686| doi = 10.1126/science.1103618| pmid = 15576594| issue = 5702}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "AmericasClimateChoices-2010-SciPanel"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher=The National Academies Press| isbn = 0-309-14588-0| last = America's Climate Choices: Panel on Advancing the Science of Climate Change; National Research Council| title = Advancing the Science of Climate Change| location = Washington, D.C.| year = 2010| url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12782}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USNAS-2008-ClimateChoices"&gt;{{cite web | title = Understanding and Responding to Climate Change| url = http://dels-old.nas.edu/dels/rpt_briefs/climate_change_2008_final.pdf|publisher=[[United States National Academy of Sciences]]|accessdate=30 May 2010|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[history of science and technology|historian of science]] [[Naomi Oreskes]] published an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' reporting that a survey of the abstracts of 928 science articles published between 1993 and 2003 showed none which disagreed explicitly with the notion of [[anthropogenic global warming]].&lt;ref name="Oreskes_science"&gt;Naomi Oreskes, "[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5702/1686 The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change.]" ''Science'' 306:5702 (3 December 2004): p. 1686. Accessed 7 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial published in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Oreskes stated that those who opposed these scientific findings are amplifying the normal range of scientific uncertainty about any facts into an appearance that there is a great scientific disagreement, or a lack of scientific consensus.&lt;ref name="Oreskes_washpost"&gt;Naomi Oreskes, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26065-2004Dec25.html Undeniable Global Warming.]" ''The Washington Post'' (26 December 2004): B07.&lt;/ref&gt; Oreskes's findings were replicated by other methods that require no interpretation.&lt;ref name="Shwed and Bearman 2010" /&gt;

The theory of [[evolution|evolution through natural selection]] is also supported by an overwhelming scientific consensus; it is one of the most reliable and empirically tested theories in science.&lt;ref name="NAS"&gt;{{cite book |author=National Academy of Science Institute of Medicine | title=Science, Evolution, and Creationism | publisher=National Academy Press | year=2008|isbn=0-309-10586-2 | url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11876}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"That this controversy is one largely manufactured by the proponents of creationism and intelligent design may not matter, and as long as the controversy is taught in classes on current affairs, politics, or religion, and not in science classes, neither scientists nor citizens should be concerned." [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/21/2277 Intelligent Judging – Evolution in the Classroom and the Courtroom] George J. Annas, [[New England Journal of Medicine]], Volume 354:2277–81  May 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of evolution claim that there is significant dissent on evolution within the scientific community.&lt;ref name="gould"&gt;Stephen Jay Gould, "[http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html Evolution as Fact and Theory,]" May 1981; in ''Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes.'' New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1994: 253–62.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[wedge strategy]], a plan to promote [[intelligent design]], depended greatly on seeding and building on public perceptions of absence of consensus on evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.pdf "The Wedge Document"] Discovery Institute, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inherent [[uncertainty in science]], where theories are never ''proven'' but can only be ''disproven'' (see [[falsifiability]]), poses a problem for politicians, policymakers, lawyers, and business professionals. Where scientific or philosophical questions can often languish in uncertainty for decades within their disciplinary settings, policymakers are faced with the problems of making sound decisions based on the currently available data, even if it is likely not a final form of the "truth". The tricky part is discerning what is close enough to "final truth". For example, social action against smoking probably came too long after science was 'pretty consensual'.&lt;ref name="Shwed and Bearman 2010" /&gt;

Certain domains, such as the approval of certain technologies for public consumption, can have vast and far-reaching political, economic, and human effects should things run awry with the predictions of scientists. However, insofar as there is an expectation that policy in a given field reflect knowable and pertinent data and well-accepted models of the relationships between observable phenomena, there is little good alternative for policy makers than to rely on so much of what may fairly be called 'the scientific consensus' in guiding policy design and implementation, at least in circumstances where the need for policy intervention is compelling. While science cannot supply 'absolute truth' (or even its complement 'absolute error') its utility is bound up with the capacity to guide policy in the direction of increased public good and away from public harm. Seen in this way, the demand that policy rely only on what is proven to be "scientific truth" would be a prescription for policy paralysis and amount in practice to advocacy of acceptance of all of the quantified and unquantified costs and risks associated with policy inaction.&lt;ref name="Shwed and Bearman 2010" /&gt;

No part of policy formation on the basis of the ostensible scientific consensus precludes persistent review either of the relevant scientific consensus or the tangible results of policy. Indeed, the same reasons that drove reliance upon the consensus drives the continued evaluation of this reliance over time – and adjusting policy as needed.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

A '''skew arch''' (also known as an '''oblique arch''') is a method of construction that enables an [[arch bridge]] to span an obstacle at some angle other than a [[right angle]]. This results in the faces of the arch not being perpendicular to its [[abutments]] and its [[plan view]] being a [[parallelogram]], rather than the [[rectangle]] that is the plan view of a regular, or "square" [[arch]].

In the case of a masonry skew arch, the construction requires precise [[stonemasonry|stonecutting]], as the cuts do not form right angles, but once the principles were fully understood in the early 19th century, it became considerably easier and cheaper to build a skew arch of [[brick]].

The problem of building skew arch masonry bridges was addressed by a number of early [[civil engineer]]s and [[mathematician]]s, including [[Giovanni Barbara]] (1726), [[William Chapman (engineer)|William Chapman]] (1787), [[Benjamin Outram]] (1798), [[Peter Nicholson (architect)|Peter Nicholson]] (1828), [[George Stephenson]] (1830), [[Edward Sang]] (1835), [[Charles Fox (civil and railway engineer)|Charles Fox]] (1836), [[George W. Buck]] (1839) and [[William Froude]] (''c.'' 1844).

The common method they all used was to clad the timber [[centring]] (also known as [[falsework]]) with planks, known as "laggings", laid parallel with the abutments and carefully planed and levelled to approximate closely the required curve of the [[intrados]] of the arch. The positions of the courses in the vicinity of the crown were first marked out at right angles to the faces using long wooden straight-edges, then the remaining courses were marked out in parallel. The masons then laid the stones, cutting them to shape as required.&lt;ref name="schofield"/&gt;

When the angle does not vary more than ten or twelve degrees from a right angle, the arch-stones may be formed as already described; but in cases of greater obliquity, a different principle of construction is necessary. These cases should, however, be avoided wherever it is possible; as, however solid the construction of an oblique bridge may be in reality, it has neither the apparent solidity nor fitness which ought to characterize an useful and pleasing object.

An example of the latter type of construction is [[Denbigh Hall railway station|Denbigh Hall]] Bridge, built in 1837 to carry the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] across [[Watling Street]] at an acute angle of only 25°.&lt;ref name="long"/&gt;
Now a Grade II listed structure, the bridge is still in use today, carrying the busy [[West Coast Main Line]]. It was constructed in the form of a long gallery, some {{convert|200|ft|m}} long and {{convert|34|ft|m}} wide, consisting of iron girders resting on walls built parallel with the road; the girders, and consequently the faces of the bridge, being perpendicular to the roadway and the railway line being laid out obliquely across the top, the need to build a highly skewed bridge of {{convert|80|ft|m}} span was therefore avoided.&lt;ref name="long"/&gt;

The eminent canal engineer [[James Brindley]] never succeeding in working out a solution to the problem of constructing a strong skew arch and as a consequence all his overbridges were built at right angles to the waterway, with double bends in the roadway, where necessary, and to this day many of them cause inconvenience to their users.&lt;ref name="schofield"/&gt; However, it was the coming of the railway, with its need to cross existing obstacles, such as rivers, roads, canals and other railways, in as straight a line as possible, that rekindled the civil engineer's interest in the skew arch bridge.&lt;ref name="troyano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fox"/&gt;

===The false skew arch===
[[File:Colostbridge-b.jpg|thumb|Colorado Street Bridge, an example of a false skew arch]]
The strength of a regular arch (also known as a "square" or "right" arch) comes from the fact that the mass of the structure and its superincumbent load cause lines of force that are carried by the stones into the ground and the abutments without producing any tendency for the stones to slide with respect to one another. This is due to the fact that the [[course (architecture)|courses]] of stone are laid parallel to the abutments, which in a regular arch causes them also to lie perpendicular to its faces. For only slightly oblique bridges, where the skew angle is less than approximately 15° it is possible to use the same construction method, laying the stones in courses parallel to the abutments.&lt;ref name="schofield"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; The result is known as a "false" skew arch and analysis of the forces within it shows that in each corner where the face forms an acute angle with an abutment there are resultant forces that are not perpendicular to the planes of the stone courses whose tendency is to push the stones out of the face, the only resistance to this being provided by friction and the adhesion of the mortar between the stones.&lt;ref name="schofield"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sinopoli"&gt;

Before starting work on Store Street Aqueduct, Outram built a number of false skew arches, one of them with a skew angle as great as 19°, as [[accommodation bridge]]s across the [[Huddersfield Narrow Canal]]. The fact that these inherently weak structures are still standing today is attributed to their light loading.&lt;ref name="schofield2"&gt;

===A more rigorous approach===
When considering the balance of forces within a regular arch, in which all courses of masonry that make up the barrel are parallel with its abutments and perpendicular to its faces, it is convenient to consider it as a two-dimensional object by taking a vertical section through the body of the arch and parallel with its faces, thereby ignoring any variation in [[quasistatic loading|loading]] along the length of its barrel.&lt;ref name="chandler"/&gt; In an oblique or skew arch the axis of the barrel is deliberately not perpendicular to the faces, the deviation from perpendicularity being known as the skew angle or the "obliquity" of the arch.&lt;ref name="rankine"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For this reason a skew arch needs to be thought of as a three-dimensional object and by considering the direction of the lines of force within the barrel the optimum orientation for the courses of stonework that make the barrel can be decided.&lt;ref name="fox"/&gt;

===The helicoidal skew arch===
A characteristic of the regular arch is that the courses of stones run parallel to the abutments and perpendicular to the faces.&lt;ref name="rankine2"&gt;
Rankine, 1867, op. cit., p. 414.
&lt;/ref&gt; In an oblique arch these two conditions can not both be met because the faces and the abutments are deliberately not perpendicular. Since skew angles greater than about 15° are required for many applications mathematicians and engineers, such as Chapman, abandoned the idea of laying the courses of stones parallel to the abutments and considered the alternative of laying the courses perpendicular to the faces of the arch, and accepting the fact that they would then no longer run parallel to the abutments.&lt;ref name="schofield" /&gt; Though Outram's Store Street Aqueduct was constructed with this principle in mind it was done so [[empirical]]ly, with the masons cutting each [[voussoir]] stone as it was required, and it was not until 1828 that details of the technique were published in a form that was useful to other engineers and stonemasons.&lt;ref name="nicholson-II"&gt;

In his book ''A Popular and Practical Treatise on Masonry and Stone-cutting'' (1828), Scottish architect, mathematician, cabinet-maker and engineer [[Peter Nicholson (architect)|Peter Nicholson]] first set out in clear and understandable terms a workable method for determining the shape and position of the stones required for the construction of a strong skew arch that enabled them to be prepared in advance of the actual construction process.&lt;ref name="schofield" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nicholson"&gt;

Nicholson approached the problem by constructing a [[development (differential geometry)|development]] of the intrados{{Cref2|E}} of the arch from the plan and elevation drawings, effectively unrolling and flattening the surface, then drawing the courses perpendicular to the faces,{{Cref2|F}} adding the header joints perpendicular to the courses, then finally rolling up the development diagram by [[projection (mathematics)|projecting]] the detail of the intrados back onto the plan and elevation drawings, a technique also used by others who would later offer alternative solutions to the problem.&lt;ref name="nicholson"/&gt; This method resulted in the courses of stone voussoirs making up the barrel of the skew arch following parallel [[helix|helical]]{{Cref2|G}} paths between the abutments, giving the view along the barrel an attractive [[rifling|rifled]] appearance. Although these courses meet the arch faces at right angles at the crown of the arch, the nearer they are to the springing line the greater their deviation from perpendicularity.&lt;ref name="rankine"/&gt; Thus Nicholson's method is not the perfect solution, but it is a workable one that has one great advantage over more purist alternatives, namely that since the helical courses run parallel to each other, all the voussoir stones can be cut to the same pattern, the only exceptions being the ring stones, or [[quoin (architecture)|quoins]], where the barrel meets the faces of the arch, each of which is unique but has an identical copy in the other face.&lt;ref name="arthur"&gt;

Nicholson never pretended to have invented the skew arch but in his later work ''The Guide to Railway Masonry, containing a Complete Treatise on the Oblique Arch'' (1839), he does claim to have invented the method for producing the templates that enabled the accurate cutting of the voussoir stones used in all skew bridges built between the years 1828 and 1836, citing testimonials from the builders of major works, such as the Croft Viaduct&lt;ref name="rennison2"&gt;
Rennison, 1996, op. cit., pp. 135–136.
&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Croft-on-Tees]] near [[Darlington]].&lt;ref name="nicholson-II"/&gt; However, by 1836 a young engineer called Charles Fox had improved on Nicholson's helicoidal method and other writers were proposing alternative approaches to the problem.&lt;ref name="dobson"&gt;

In performing his calculations Nicholson considered the arch barrel to be made from one ring of stones and of negligible thickness and therefore he developed only the intrados.&lt;ref name="philmag"&gt;

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The idea was expanded in [[Charles Fox (civil and railway engineer)|Charles Fox's]] 1836 publication ''On the Construction of Skew Arches'', in which he considered the intrados of the barrel and the [[extrados]] as separate surfaces mapped onto concentric cylinders by drawing a separate development for each.&lt;ref name="fox"/&gt; This approach had two advantages. Firstly, he was able to develop a theoretical third, intermediate surface midway between the intrados and the extrados, which allowed him to align the centre of each voussoir, rather than its inner surface, along the desired line, thereby better approximating the ideal placement than Nicholson was able to achieve.&lt;ref name="fox"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spencer"&gt;

    }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Secondly, it enabled him to develop an arbitrary number of concentric intermediate surfaces so as to plan the courses in multi-ring skew arch barrels, allowing them for the first time to be constructed in brick, and therefore much more economically than was previously possible.&lt;ref name="hyde"&gt;

In order to explain how he visualised the courses of voussoirs in a stone skew arch, Fox wrote, "The principle which I have adopted is, to work the stones in the form of a spiral quadrilateral solid, wrapped round a cylinder, or, in plainer language, the principle of a square threaded screw: hence it becomes quite evident, that the transverse sections of all these spiral stones are the same throughout the whole arch. It will be obvious, that the beds of the stones should be worked into true spiral [helicoidal] planes."&lt;ref name="fox"/&gt; So, a stone skew arch built to Fox's plan would have its voussoirs cut with a slight twist, in order to follow the shape of a [[square thread form|square threaded screw]].

While claiming a superior method, Fox openly acknowledged Nicholson's contribution&lt;ref name="philmag"/&gt; but in 1837 he felt the need to reply to a published letter written in support of Nicholson by fellow engineer Henry Welch, the County Bridge Surveyor for [[Northumberland]].&lt;ref name="welch"/&gt; Unfortunately the three men became involved in a [[Paper War of 1752–1753|paper war]] that, following a number of earlier altercations in which the originality of his writings was questioned, left the 71-year-old Nicholson feeling bitter and unappreciated.&lt;ref name="laxton"&gt;

The following year Fox, still aged only 28 and employed by [[Robert Stephenson]] as an engineer on the [[London and Birmingham Railway]], presented his paper encapsulating these principles to the [[Royal Institution]] and from this was born the English or [[helicoidal]] method of constructing brick skew arches.&lt;ref name="fox"/&gt; Using this method many thousands of skew bridges were built either entirely of brick or of brick with stone quoins by railway companies in the United Kingdom, a substantial number of which survive and are still in use today.&lt;ref name="chandler"/&gt;

In 1839, [[George W. Buck|George Watson Buck]], having also worked on the London and Birmingham Railway under Stephenson before moving to the [[Manchester and Birmingham Railway]], published a work entitled ''A Practical and Theoretical Essay on Oblique Bridges'' in which he also acknowledged Nicholson's contribution but, finding it lacking in detail,&lt;ref name="buck-v-nicholson-I"&gt;

Buck's trigonometrical approach allowed every dimension of a skew arch to be calculated without recourse to taking measurements from scale drawings and it allowed him to calculate the theoretical minimum angle of obliquity to which a practical semicircular helicoidal skew bridge could be designed and safely built.&lt;ref name="buck2"&gt;
Buck, 1839, op. cit., p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;
The "Buck Limit", as it is known, has a value of 25°40′ or, when quoted in terms of the ''maximum angle of skew'', a value of 64°20′.&lt;ref name="buck2"/&gt;

Buck paid particular attention to the design of bridges of extreme obliquity, addressing two potential problems he had identified. Firstly, he noted that the acutely angled quoins at the obtuse corners of the plan view were very susceptible to damage during construction, settlement or by accidental blows in subsequent use so he devised a method of [[chamfer]]ing the edge, removing the single acute angle and replacing it with two obtuse angles and, in his own words, "the quantity thus cut off from the acute quoin, is gradually diminished to the opposite or obtuse quoin, where the cutting vanishes; by this contrivance no angle less than a right angle is any where presented on the exterior of the work […] the effect produced is elegant and pleasing to the eye."&lt;ref name="buck4"&gt;

Secondly, he recommended that the extrados of the barrel of an arch of great obliquity be formed into [[rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] steps so as to provide a horizontal bed for the [[spandrel]] walls in order to overcome their tendency to slide off the arch barrel.&lt;ref name="buck5"&gt;

The bridge carrying the London and Birmingham Railway over the London Road at [[Boxmoor]] in Hertfordshire, adjacent to what is now [[Hemel Hempstead railway station|Hemel Hempstead station]] on the West Coast Main Line, is an example of a segmental arch of extreme obliquity that was designed by Buck and incorporates both of these features. Constructed in masonry, with a brick barrel, stone quoins and a 58° angle of skew, it was completed in 1837.&lt;ref name="roscoe"/&gt; Shortly before the railway opened the bridge was the subject of an ink and [[wash (painting)|wash]] drawing dated 12 June 1837, one of a series of works by artist [[John Cooke Bourne]] illustrating the construction of the line.&lt;ref name="ssl"&gt;

Buck's ''Essay'', containing its criticism of Nicholson's work,&lt;ref name="buck-v-nicholson-I"/&gt; was published in July 1839, just a few months before Nicholson's ''Guide to Railway Masonry'', causing the ongoing paper war in ''The Civil Engineer and Architect's Journal'' to continue acrimoniously as Nicholson accused Buck of stealing his ideas&lt;ref name="nicholson-v-buck"&gt;

===Alternatives to the helicoidal method===
The helicoidal method of laying down the stone or brick courses championed by Nicholson, Fox and Buck is only an approximation to the ideal. Since the courses are only square to the faces of the arch at the crown and deviate more from perpendicularity the closer they are to the springing line, thereby over-correcting the deficiencies of the false skew arch and weakening the obtuse angle,
&lt;!--

i.e. the corner of the plan where the face and abutment meet in an obtuse angle, but where the quoins themselves have acute angles

--&gt;
the mathematical purists recommend that helicoidal construction be restricted to segmental arches and not be used in full-centred (semicircular) designs.&lt;ref name="hart"&gt;

  |quote = Arches of great obliquity are much the strongest when constructed with a segmental elevation; whether the segment of a circle or an ellipse, is of little importance, so long as the rise is between a third and sixth of the span of the semi-figure. The more oblique the plan of the bridge, the greater is the necessity for keeping the arch flat; and for the following reasons. All semi-arches built with spiral courses are strongest at the summit, because the stones in that position approach nearer to a right angle than in any other; therefore, the more remote from the summit, the more weak the arch will unavoidably be; consequently, as they near the horizon, they decrease in strength and beauty, as they increase in cost and difficulty of construction.

Despite this there were many full-centred skew bridges built to the helicoidal pattern and many still stand, [[Kielder Viaduct]] and [[Neidpath Viaduct]] being just two examples.

[[File:Skew Bridge LLC-74A (2).jpg|thumb|Detailed view of the intrados of bridge 74A]]
The search for a technically pure [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] method of constructing a skew arch led to the proposal of the logarithmic method by [[Edward Sang]], a mathematician living in Edinburgh, in his presentation in three parts to the [[Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce|Society for the Encouragement of the Useful Arts]] between 18 November 1835 and 27 January 1836, during which time he was elected vice-president of the Society, though his work was not published until 1840.&lt;ref name="jameson"&gt;

While a helix is produced by projecting a straight line onto the surface of a cylinder, Sang's method requires that a series of [[logarithm]]ic curves be projected onto a cylindrical surface, hence its name.&lt;ref name="frenchives2"&gt;
French; Ives, 1902, op. cit., p. 100.
&lt;/ref&gt;
In terms of strength and stability, a skew bridge built to the logarithmic pattern has advantages over one built to the helicoidal pattern, especially so in the case of full-centred designs.&lt;ref name="hyde"/&gt; However, the courses are not parallel, being thinner towards the most acutely angled quoin (located where the face of the arch makes an obtuse angle with the abutment in the plan view, at S and Q in the development to the left, and at the left hand side of the photograph of the intrados on the right) and thicker towards the most obtusely angled quoin (at O and G in the development and just off the right hand side of the photograph),

He presented a paper on the subject to the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] the following year and in 1841, academic [[William Whewell]] of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] published his book ''The Mechanics of Engineering'' in which he expounded the virtues of building skew bridges with equilibrated courses, but due to the poor complexity to benefit ratio, there have been few other adopters.&lt;ref name="dobson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whewell"/&gt;

====The French ''corne de vache'' method====
[[File:Williams Froude.jpeg|thumb|150px|left|William Froude (1810–1879)]]
[[File:Skew Arch at Cowley Bridge Junction.jpg|thumb|Skew arch at [[Cowley Bridge Junction]] showing the complex brickwork]]
The ''corne de vache'' or "cow's horn" method is another way of laying courses such that they meet the face of the arch orthogonally at all elevations.&lt;ref name="hyde3"&gt;
Hyde, 1899, op. cit., pp. 74–101.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike the helicoidal and logarithmic methods, in which the intrados of the arch barrel is cylindrical,{{Cref2|I}} the ''corne de vache'' method results in a warped [[paraboloid|hyperbolic paraboloid]] surface that dips in the middle, rather like a saddle.&lt;ref name="frenchives4"&gt;
French; Ives, 1902, op. cit., p. 99.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite being known as the French method of skew arch building, it was actually introduced by English engineer [[William Froude]] whilst working under [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] on the [[Bristol and Exeter Railway]], which opened in 1844.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;

  |isbn = 1-904381-40-5
  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although no details of Froude's work in this area survive and despite being better remembered for his work on [[hydrodynamics]], he is known to have built at least two overbridges in red brick with stone quoins using this principle on the line just north of [[Exeter]], at [[Cowley Bridge Junction]] where the [[A377 road|A377]] Exeter–Barnstaple road crosses at an oblique angle &lt;!-- Grid ref. SX909953 --&gt; and, about {{convert|4|mi|km}} to the northeast, at [[Rewe, Devon|Rewe]], &lt;!-- Grid ref. SX945994 --&gt; on the [[A396 road|A396]], both of which survive and are in daily use.&lt;ref name="brown2"&gt;
Brown, 2006, op. cit., p. 26.
&lt;/ref&gt;
The brickwork is considerably more complex than in a helicoidal design and, in order to ensure that the courses of bricks meet the faces of the arch at right angles, many had to be cut to produce tapers.&lt;ref name="harvey"&gt;

The ''corne de vache'' approach tends to result in a structure that is almost as strong as one built to the logarithmic pattern and considerably stronger than one built to the helicoidal pattern but, again, the extra complexity has meant that the method has not seen widespread adoption, especially since the simpler helicoidal structure can be built much stronger if a segmental design is chosen, rather than a full-centred one.&lt;ref name="hyde"/&gt;

====The ribbed skew arch====

[[File:Hereford Road bridge, Ledbury (2).jpg|thumb|Hereford Road Bridge, Ledbury, a ribbed skew arch made of stone with ribs of blue brick]]
The ribbed skew arch is a form of the false skew arch in which several narrow regular arches or ribs, offset laterally with respect to one another, are used to approximate a true skew arch.&lt;ref name="frenchives5"&gt;
French; Ives, 1902, op. cit., pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;
Motivated by the lack of skilled stonemasons in the 18th century United States, the design was first proposed in 1802 for a crossing of the [[Schuylkill River]] in [[Philadelphia]] by British-born American architect [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]]&lt;ref name="haer"&gt;

Because the series of arch ribs are all regular arches this method of construction has the advantage of being less demanding of unskilled artisans but it has received considerable criticism as being weak, susceptible to frost damage, ugly and wasteful of materials.&lt;ref name="culley3"&gt;
Culley, 1886, op. cit., pp. 115–116. "This method is very faulty, and cannot be too severely condemned. There is no bond between the several ribs, as each rib is separate and distinct in its construction and its position; the load above the arch is never uniform throughout the whole length of the arch, and on account of this lack of bond in the arch, it will be distorted by its unequal settlement. Again, the outer ribs are constantly being forced outwards by the action of frost upon the material that finds lodgement between their heading surfaces."&lt;/ref&gt;
Although Latrobe's bridge was never built as proposed, his method of construction was later to be used extensively by the [[Philadelphia and Reading Railroad]] throughout the Philadelphia area, including an [[Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, Schuylkill River Viaduct|ambitious viaduct]] designed by Gustavus A.

Thanks to the reinforcing of the spandrel walls in 1935, the bridge continues to carry rail traffic to this day.&lt;ref name="haer"/&gt;

The [[Midland Railway]] in the United Kingdom suffered from no such shortage of skilled workers but as part of its southern extension towards its [[London]] terminus at [[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras]], it was faced with the need to cross Southdown Road in [[Harpenden]] at an extremely acute angle of approximately 25°,&lt;ref name="geograph-I"&gt;

a figure more acute than the theoretical limit of 25°40′ proposed by Buck,&lt;ref name="buck2"/&gt; and requiring a bridge with a skew angle of 65°, a situation not unlike that faced by the London and Birmingham railway 30 years earlier at Denbigh Hall. This time the chosen solution was to build [[Southdown Road Skew Bridge|Southdown Road bridge]] as a ribbed skew arch, which opened for traffic in 1868 and was successfully widened in 1893 when the line was converted to quadruple track.&lt;ref name="widening"&gt;

Despite the aforementioned criticisms of the design, the bridge is still standing and in daily use by express and commuter trains.

A smaller and less extremely skewed example is [[Hereford Road Skew Bridge|Hereford Road bridge]] in [[Ledbury]], Herefordshire, which was built in 1881 to carry the [[Ledbury and Gloucester Railway]] at an angle of approximately 45° across the Hereford Road, now a section of the [[A438 road|A438]].&lt;ref name="geograph-II"&gt;

Notice that the two bridges in the photographs skew in opposite directions. Southdown Road bridge is said to have a left-hand skew due to the near face being offset to the left of the far face, while Hereford Road bridge has a right-hand skew.&lt;ref name="buck3"&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:Stephensonbridge1.jpg|left|thumb|Rainhill Skew Bridge from Rainhill Station]]
[[File:StephensonBridgeClose.jpg|right|thumb|A close-up of the stonework of Rainhill Bridge]]
Early skew arch bridges were painstakingly built from masonry blocks, each individually and expensively cut to its own unique shape, with no two edges either parallel or perpendicular.&lt;ref name="rainhill1"&gt;
{{cite web

|title = The Trials Map – Points of Interest
|publisher = The Rainhill Trials
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A fine example of such construction is the famous [[George Stephenson#Stephenson's skew arch bridge|Rainhill Skew Bridge]], which was designed with a skew span of {{convert|54|ft|m}}, in order to give a clear span across the railway of {{convert|30|ft|m}} at a skew angle of 56° by [[George Stephenson]] and built as a full-sized wooden model in an adjacent field before being completed in 1830.&lt;ref name="long"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rainhill1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rainhill2"&gt;

A contemporary skew bridge built to carry the Haggerleazes branch of the Stockton and Darlington Railway over the River Gaunless in [[County Durham]] proved too difficult for the original contractors, Thomas Worth and John Batie, who, after piling the foundations for the abutments and laying the lower courses of masonry, abandoned the work. The contract was re-let to James Wilson of [[Pontefract]] on 28 May 1830 for £420, an increase of £93 over the original tender. As the principles were not completely understood, the work continued to prove difficult and its imminent collapse was solemnly predicted right up until the time, a few days before the opening of the branch, the centring was removed and the crown of the arch settled by less than half an inch (13&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref name="tomlinson"/&gt;

==Notes==
{{Cnote2 Begin|liststyle=upper-alpha|colwidth=30em}}
{{Cnote2|A|The ''skew angle'' or ''angle of skew'', ''&amp;theta;'' is the angle between the centre line of the arch barrel and the perpendicular to the face of the arch. A regular arch is defined as having a zero angle of skew. The ''angle of obliquity'', ''&amp;Omega;'' is the [[complementary angles|complement]] of the angle of skew, though there is some confusion in a number of the 19th century texts where angle of skew and angle of obliquity tend to be used interchangeably.&lt;ref name="culley2"&gt;Culley, 1886, op. cit., p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{Cnote2|B|The ''skew span'' or ''span on the skew'', ''S'' is the span of the arch measured parallel to its face. This is the ''actual'' span of the skew arch, for which it must be engineered, and it is always greater than the ''usable'' span.}}
{{Cnote2|C|The ''square span'' or ''span on the square'', ''s'' is the span of the arch measured perpendicular to the abutments. This is the ''usable'' span for the roadway beneath the arch (hence, it is also known as the ''clear span'') and it is related to the skew span by the following formula: ''s''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#61;&amp;nbsp;''S''&amp;nbsp;cos&amp;nbsp;''&amp;theta;'' .}}
{{Cnote2|D|The ''rise'' of a skew arch is equal to the rise of a regular arch whose span is equal to the skew span of the skew bridge. A limiting case is the ''full-centred'' or semicircular skew arch, in which case the rise is equal to the radius of the arch, or half the skew span. For segmental, three-centred, and elliptical skew arches the rise is less than this limiting case.}}
{{Cnote2|E|The term ''intrados'' is used because it is the mathematically correct term, referring to the curved surface of the inside of the arch barrel. The equivalent architectural term is ''[[soffit]]''.}}
{{Cnote2|F|Strictly speaking, the development of the face of a skew arch is not actually a straight line, but an S-shaped curve, the curvature of which becomes more pronounced with increasing angle of skew. Nicholson therefore added a straight line, called "the approximate line", between the ends of each face on the development drawing and then drew the courses perpendicular to it.&lt;ref name="philmag"/&gt; The approximate line is [[tangential]] to the curve of the face only at the crown, with the difference increasing with distance away from that point.&lt;ref name="fox"/&gt;}}
{{Cnote2|G|The 19th century texts use the word ''spiral'' to describe both lines and surfaces. The ''helix'' is a special case of the generic spiral and applies only to a line. It is used to describe the rifled appearance of the intrados of this particular class of skew arch: the courses follow helical paths between the imposts. The ''helicoid'' is a curved surface swept out by a radius moving in a helical path about an axial line. The bearing surfaces of a square threaded screw and its associated nut are helicoidal, and so are the bedding planes between adjacent courses of voussoirs in this class of skew arch.}}
{{Cnote2|H|Equilibrated courses are ones built without residual [[shear stress]]es.&lt;ref name="whewell"/&gt;}}
{{Cnote2|I|This is the strict [[differential geometry]] definition of a cylinder, which includes both the ''right circular cylinder'' (the common cylinder with which everyone is familiar) and the ''right elliptic cylinder''. If a helicoidal skew arch has a semicircular cross section, when taken on the square, perpendicular to the abutments, its barrel will have a shape based on the common cylinder (a semicylinder, in fact), and its cross section (taken on the skew, parallel with its faces) will be semi-elliptical. Segmental circular skew arches also have barrels based on the shape of the common cylinder, while those constructed with a semi-elliptical square section will have a flatter, wider semi-elliptical skew section. The [[extrude]]d profile of a three-centred arch, strictly speaking, does not fall under this definition of a cylinder.}}

"We are the first generation with the insight of the new global risks facing humanity, that people and societies are the biggest drivers of global change. The basic analysis is not in question: we cannot continue on our current path and need to take action quickly. Science can guide us in identifying the pathway to global sustainability, provided that it also engages in an open dialogue with society," says [[Professor]] [[Mario Molina]], who acted as judge and received the Nobel Prize in [[Chemistry]] in 1995.

==Conclusions==
Key conclusion of the Stockholm Memorandum include:
* that environmental sustainability is a precondition for poverty eradication, economic development, and social justice; 
* that achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals]] is a top priority, since almost a third of the world scrapes by on less than $2 per day;
* that the [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) is insufficient as an economic indicator and that, therefore, new human welfare indicators must be developed;

A '''synchronoptic view''' is a [[graphical|graphic]] display of a number of [[entity|entities]] as they proceed through time. A synchronoptic view can be used for many purposes but is best suited to the visual display of [[history]]. A number of related [[Chronology|timeline]]s can be drawn on a single chart showing which events and lives are contemporary and which are unconnected.

A synchronoptic view has important [[education]]al advantages. [[Visual perception|Visible]] information is much more easily learned, than when it is presented only in pure text form. [[History]] is an ideal subject for a synchronoptic view. Multiple [[timeline]]s are able to show how events interacted. Multiple lifelines can show which people were contemporaries.
([http://www.hyperhistory.com/chart/section.html See example])

A combination of maps is also synchronoptic when it displays successive moments in time.

==Etymology==
The [[concept]] in question is made [[Visual perception|visual]] &amp;mdash; hence ''optic''.
The elements are displayed [[Synchronization|synchronously]]: i.e. which events in one area happened at the same time as events in another seemingly unrelated area.
Thus ''synchron-optic''.

Synchronoptic also means visible at the same time", or "with parallel views". i.e. The user gets a view of all the information in one go.

==Carte chronographique==
[[File:Barbeu-Dubourg - Chronographie (Tableau 34).png|thumb|right|''Carte chronographique'' (1753)]]
[[Jacques Barbeu-Dubourg]] (1709–1779) was the first to develop a synchronoptical visualisation with his ''Chronographie universelle &amp; details qui en dependent pour la Chronologie &amp; les Genealogies'' (1753) abbreviated to ''Carte chronographique''.&lt;ref name=SB&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidt-Burkhardt|first1=Astrit|title=Learning in the Age of Enlightenment|url=http://georgemaciunas.com/exhibitions/knowledge-as-art-chance-computability-and-improving-education-thomas-bayes-alan-turing-george-maciunas/george-maciunas/maciunas-learning-machine-learning-in-the-age-of-enlightenment-by-astrit-schmidt-burkhardt/|website=http://georgemaciunas.com/|publisher=George Maciunas Foundation Inc.|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chronographic chart consisted of 35 prints which were designed to be stuck together in a row, enabling 6,500 years to be represented in 6.5 meters.&lt;ref name=SB/&gt; The horizontal axis representing the passage of time was consistent throughout, but the vertical axis was varied depending on the categories Barbeu-Dubourg considered relevant for that period of history.&lt;ref name=SB/&gt;

'''Systems biomedicine''', also called '''systems biomedical science''',&lt;ref&gt;Systems approaches to biomedical science doctoral training programme at the University of Oxford in the UK. Their website: http://www.sabscdt.ox.ac.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; is the application of [[systems biology]] to the understanding and modulation of developmental and pathological processes in humans, and in animal and cellular models. Whereas systems biology aims at modeling exhaustive networks of interactions&lt;ref&gt;Uri Alon, An Introduction to Systems Biology - Design Principles of Biological Circuits, CRC Press, 3rd printing (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; (with the long-term goal of, for example, creating a comprehensive [[computational model]] of the cell), mainly at intra-cellular level, systems biomedicine emphasizes the multilevel, hierarchical nature of the models ([[molecule]], [[organelle]], [[cell (biology)|cell]], [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], [[organ (anatomy)|organ]], individual/[[genotype]], [[environmental factor]], [[population]], [[ecosystem]]) by discovering and selecting the key factors at each level and integrating them into models that reveal the global, [[emergence|emergent behavior]] of the biological process under consideration.

Such an approach will be favorable when the execution of all the experiments necessary to establish exhaustive models is limited by time and expense (e.g., in animal models) or basic ethics (e.g., human experimentation).

In the year of 1992, a paper on system biomedicine by Kamada T. was published (Nov.-Dec.), and an article on systems medicine and pharmacology by Zeng B.J. was also published (April) in the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;Zeng (B.) J., On the holographic model of human body, 1st National Conference of Comparative
Studies Traditional Chinese Medicine and West Medicine, Medicine and Philosophy, April, 1992 ( termed "systems medicine and pharmacology").&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009, the first collective book on systems biomedicine was edited by Edison T. Liu and Douglas A. Lauffenburger.&lt;ref&gt;Edison T. Liu and Douglas A. Lauffenburger, Systems Biomedicine: Concepts and Perspectives, Academic Press (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, one of the first research groups uniquely devoted to systems biomedicine was established at the [[European Institute of Oncology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifom-ieo-campus.it/research/donofrio.php IFOM-IEO Campus::Research program::Alberto d'Onofrio::Systems Biomedicine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first research centers specialized on systems biomedicine was founded by [[Rudi Balling]]. The [http://wwwde.uni.lu/lcsb Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine] is an interdisciplinary center of the [http://wwwen.uni.lu/ University of Luxembourg]. The first centre devoted to spatial issues in systems biomedicine has been recently established&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/basic-science-departments/biomedical-engineering/spatial-systems-biomedicine/about.cfm Center for Spatial Systems Biomedicine -About&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Oregon Health and Science University]].

The first peer-reviewed journal on this topic, [http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/systemsbiomedicine/ Systems Biomedicine], was recently established by [[Landes Bioscience]].

The '''technological and industrial history of Canada''' encompasses the country's development in the areas of transportation, communication, energy, materials, public works, public services (health care), domestic/consumer and defense technologies. The 21st century has become the Internet Age is way both literal and metaphorical. The technology that dominates this period of time is wireless technology, cloud computing, HD/3D TV, mega oil, "[[Environmental technology|greentech]]" and nanotechnology. Most technologies diffused in Canada came from other places; only a small number actually originated in Canada. For more about those with a Canadian origin, see [[Invention in Canada]].

Technology is a major cultural determinant, no less important in shaping human lives than philosophy, religion, social organization, or political systems. In the broadest sense, these forces are also aspects of technology. The French sociologist [[Jacques Ellul]] defined ''la technique'' as the totality of all rational methods in every field of human activity so that, for example, education, law, sports, propaganda, and the social sciences are all technologies in that sense. At the other end of the scale, common parlance limits the term's meaning to specific industrial arts.

== Fields of technology ==

=== Internet ===
{{Main|Internet in Canada}}
The [[Internet]] has become an essential part of daily life and is found in most Canadian homes, businesses and government offices. In December 2006, there were 22,000,000 Internet users representing 65.9% of the population and  7,675,533 Internet broadband connections. In 1988, the first [[.ca]] Canadian web address, upei.ca, was assigned by John Demco of the University of British Columbia (UBC) to the University of Prince Edward Island. The one millionth .ca address, krauslaw.ca was assigned in 2008 by the [[Canadian Internet Registration Authority]], formed in 1998, to Brent Kraus of Calgary for the promotion of his law firm.&lt;ref&gt;magazine—Backbone: Business, Technology, Lifestyle, July/August 2008. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; As of the end of 2010, Canadians, on a per-capita basis, were the most intensive users of Internet in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Oliveira, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/canadians-spend-more-time-online-than-any-others/article1321456/ "Canadians spend more time online than any other country"], Globe and Mail, 28 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
During this period, the [[web search engine]] became an integral part of use of the Internet. The first such programme, the "[[Archie search engine]]", was developed by [[McGill University]] student [[Alan Emtage]] in 1990. Since then, search engines, which have been mostly developed in the US, have evolved and become more versatile and powerful. Notable engines include [[Lycos]] (1994), [[Alta Vista]] (1995), [[Magellan (search engine)|Magellan]] (1995), [[Google]] (1998), [[Yahoo! Search]] (2004), [[MSN Search]] (2005), and [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] (2009). These Internet tools are available to web users from countries around the world, including Canada.

[[E-mail]], a very popular feature of the Internet, predated that technology by decades. E-mail type functionality was a feature of a computer sharing technology developed at MIT in the US in 1961. It was also part of the US-developed [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment]] (SAGE) component of the North American air defense system created in the fifties and sixties and which included a facility at RCAF North Bay, Ontario. However, it only became a publicly used service with the development of the Internet. A number of US providers now offer this worldwide service to Canadian users, including MSN [[Hotmail]] in 1996, [[Yahoo! Mail]] in 1997, [[AOL Mail]] in 2004 and [[Gmail]] in 2004.

The development of special software allowed the Internet to be used to make computer to computer phone calls. In August 2003, a service known as [[Skype]] became available to Internet users around the world including Canada. It has since become extremely popular.

Other web sites including those for social networking such as [[Facebook]] (2004), which as of 2008 has 17 million Canadian profiles, [[MySpace]] (2003), with 4.5 million Canadian profiles as of 2008, and [[Twitter]] (2006). Video and photo sharing sites such as [[YouTube]] (2005), with 14.5 million Canadian visits per month, and Vancouver-developed [[Flickr]] (2004), have become extremely popular in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/the-not-so-private-price-paid-for-social-networking/article18138251/?page=all "The not-so-private price paid for social networking"], The Globe and Mail, 13 September 2008, p. A12.&lt;/ref&gt; The popular Canadian-developed on-line dating service Lavalife went on line for the first time in 1997. In 2010, more than 2 million Canadians were members of [[LinkedIn]], a social networking website, developed in the US in 2003 to enable workers to network for professional and career reasons. In recognition of the importance of the Canadian market, the company opened a Canadian office in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Tavia Grant, Globe and Mail, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/linkedin-set-to-open-shop-in-canada/article558142/ ''LinkedIn set to open shop in Canada''], 28 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The big Canadian banks, including the Royal Bank of Canada, the Toronto Dominion Bank, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and the Bank of Nova Scotia made their customer accounts available on line as the web gained prominence. On-line investing has grown in popularity in the new century a number of Canadian firms offer sites for this service including, [[Qtrade financial services|QTrade Investor]], BMO InvestorLine, E*Trade Canada (now Scotia iTrade), TD Waterhouse, Credential Direct, [[RBC Direct Investing]], CIBC Investor’s Edge, Disnat, ScotiaMcLeod, National Bank Direct Brokerage, and [[Virtual Brokers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = Rob Carrick| title = Qtrade retains crown| newspaper = The Globe and Mail| date = October 25, 2008| pages = B 10| url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investment-ideas/qtrade-retains-crown/article716690/?page=all| accessdate = December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other businesses established a retail presence, notably [[Amazon.com]] in 1995, which became popular enough in Canada to merit a separate Canadian site, Amazon.ca, beginning in 2002. The Internet auction site [[eBay]], launched in 1995, gave rise to a Canadian spin-off eBay.ca in 2000. [[PayPal]] has been operated by eBay since 2002, and is widely used by Canadians to cover the financial aspect of eBay transactions.

Most large Canadian corporations, including telephone and utility companies, now provide on-line customer billing.

The [[Government of Canada]] has been especially notable in establishing a very diverse and friendly on-line presence for the public. Initially, the basis for this service was a suite of technologies referred to as the Government Enterprise Network (GENet). In the fall of 2003, the government began to replace these with improved technologies known collectively as the Secure Channel Network (SCNet), which make available a wide range of services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Public Works and Government Services Canada|url=http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/apropos-about/fi-fs/cvcp-sc-eng.html|title=Secure Channel|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610011642/http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/apropos-about/fi-fs/cvcp-sc-eng.html|archivedate=June 10, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in recent years it has become possible for Canadians to file their yearly income tax returns using an Internet service provided by [[Revenue Canada]] known as [[NETFILE]].

The Internet has also become an important source of information, marked by the popularity of such sites as [[Wikipedia]] and [[Google Earth]]. Wikipedia, an on-line encyclopedia, was established in the US in 2001 by [[Jimmy Wales]] and [[Larry Sanger]] and presently has over 5,000,000 articles in English and a large number in other languages. Many articles have been contributed to both the English and French language versions of Wikipedia by Canadians, and many of these relate to important aspects of Canadian life. There are thousands of Canadians who use the service every day in both English and French. Google Earth, a virtual globe, is an on-line feature offered by [[Google]] since 2005. It provides aerial views of the Earth and is viewed by thousands of web users, many of which are Canadian, every day. Another Internet information service, the telephone directory Canada 411.ca, has become very popular since introduced in recent years. This has led to the delivery of the residential paper telephone book, introduced to Canada in 1878, being cancelled in major cities in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Krashinsky, Susan. Globe and Mail, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/hanging-up-on-the-phone-book/article1594065/ "Hanging up on the phone book"], 6 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Government of Ontario announced its intention of beginning to offer on-line [[Internet gambling]] to the residents of Ontario in 2012. It will join the [[PlayNow.com]] Internet gambling site established by the government of British Columbia in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Globe and Mail, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/ontario-bets-big-on-online-gambling/article1358307/ "Ontario bets big on online gambling"], 10 August 2010 &lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet has been the target of cyberattacks over the years. One of the most notable attacks was made by 15-year-old hacker Michel Calce, alias "Mafiaboy", from the home of his parents in Montreal. Using a technique known as "[[distributed denial-of-service]]" (DDoS), he paralyzed the websites of Yahoo, CNN, E*Trade, Dell, eBay and Amazon in February 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Genosko, Gary. [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/hacking-and-cracking/article716603/ "Hacking and Cracking"], The Globe and Mail, 25 October 2008, p. D 14&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital communication / HD TV (Delivery) ===
Star Choice ([[Shaw Direct]]) of Calgary, Alberta, and Expressvu [[Bell TV]] of Montreal began offering Canada-wide direct-to-home digital [[satellite television]]  service in 1997. As of 2008, they had 900,000 and 1.8 million subscribers respectively. Star Choice broadcast the first [[high-definition television]] programme in Canada in 2000 and began broadcasting HD full-time in 2004. HD channels have been continuously added since that date. In April 2009, Star Choice changed its name to Shaw Direct. By 2009 satellite delivered Bell TV was delivering 45 HD channels.

[[Rogers Cable]], Canada's largest cable company, began to offer its Digital Television service in 2001. [[Video on demand]] (VOD), a technology that allows digital cable subscribers to order and watch movies at a time of their choice, has been available to Canadians since 2002, the year that Rogers Communication Inc., began to offer its Rogers on Demand service. By 2009 the service was available to 3.5 million homes. Shaw Communications Inc., Canada's second largest cable company offers a similar service. Rogers introduced personal video recorders (PVRs) to customers in 2003.

The CBC began broadcasting digital over-the-air [[HDTV]] in 2005. A national government regulatory body, the Canadian Radio, Television and Telecommunications Commission, has stated that all over-the-air TV broadcasting will be digital by August 2011.

During this period, efforts to convert over-the-air AM and FM radio to digital technology failed. A technique known as [[Digital Audio Broadcasting]] (DAB) (see [[Countries using DAB/DMB]]), was introduced to Canada in November 1999. However the technology never caught on, partly because of the chicken and egg phenomenon. When the technology was introduced, there were few listeners equipped with DAB receivers, and this in turn provided little incentive for broadcasters to convert their very successful AM and FM operations to DAB. DAB came to an end in Canada in 2010. However digital satellite radio has been successful. Two Toronto-based companies, [[Sirius Canada]] and [[XM Canada]] introduced direct-to-home/car, digital [[satellite radio]] service in December 2005 and by 2008 had 750,000 and 400,000 subscribers respectively. In 1999, Telesat launched the first of four [[Nimiq]] direct broadcast satellites which provide the space-based satellite transmitters for these services.

In 2003, Bell Canada introduced an improved [[speech recognition]] system for its 310-2355 customer routing service in Ontario. Bell Canada users speak with the programme through "Emily", a young female-sounding artificial voice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bce.ca/ Bell Canada Enterprises website]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Skype]], a voice-and-video-over-Internet technology became available to users around the world, including Canadians. The technique, which bypasses the traditional telephone network, allows people to use the Internet as a type of telephone and to both talk to and see each other during calls. It is used mainly for long-distance communication.

The proliferation of multiple communications technologies has itself created the need to combine them effectively, resulting in a new technology, [[unified communications]]. This technique blends [[instant messaging]], e-mail, [[voice mail]], [[short message service]], web-conferencing, [[fax]], audio, video, cellphone, VIOP and other telecommunications services into a single system. Cooke Aquaculture Inc. of Blacks Harbour New Brunswick uses just such a system, developed by Cisco Systems Canada Co. to manage its fish farm operations.

===Digital media (content)===
Digital media were first introduced to Canada in the 1980s, when the CD and DVD became popular with consumers.

The traditional media began to develop an on-line presence in the new century. Newspapers including Canada's two English-language "national", dailies, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' and the [[National Post]] went on line as did the weekly [[Maclean's]] news magazine. The French-language press did the same including the daily [[La Presse (Canada)|''La Presse'']] and the bi-weekly ''[[L'actualité]]'' newsmagazine.

Television broadcasters got into the game, including the English-language national networks, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC), [[CTV Television Network]] (CTV) and [[Canwest]]/Global and the French-language networks, Radio Canada, [[TVA (TV network)]] and [[TQS]] (now V). In 2009, a number of news services, including [[Thomson Reuters]] and [[Canadian Press]], began to offer wireless Internet news services formatted for access by hand-held [[3G]] devices such as the Blackberry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Globe and Mail|website=theglobeandmail.com|author=Robertson, Grant|title=Media titans set to clash over smart phones|date=11 May 2009|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/media-titans-set-to-clash-over-smart-phones/article4193613/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Indigo Books and Music began to offer a [[digital book]] service known as Shortcovers. In late 2009, that electronic service was expanded and renamed Kobo ([[Kobo Inc.]]). It offers customers about 2,000,000 book titles in electronic form that can be viewed on an electronic reader. A variety of electronic books or readers have gained a place in Canada beginning with the introduction of the Sony Librie reader in 2004 and the [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] in 2009. Kobo intends to introduce its own reader in 2010 with code based on an open source concept. In 2010 a number of Canadian libraries, including the Ottawa Public Library began offering books on loan via a downloadable Kindle format.

With the release of the [[iPad]] in Canada in 2010, digital media providers have begun to format their digital media offerings to make them compatible for iPad viewing.

The [[downloading]] of music from the Internet to computers and other storage devices including the [[iPod]], has become very popular in recent years. Music can be downloaded [[peer-to-peer]] or from about 500 on-line sites in 40 countries. In Canada one site of note, [[Puretracks]], has been offering a library of about 1.3 million popular songs in [[Windows Media Audio]] and [[MP3]] format for download since 2003.

The film industry has also moved to adopt [[digital cinema]] technology. The technology of cinematic [[special effects]] has become a notable feature of the film production, with over 2300 Canadian companies, including, Side Effects Software, Toon Boom Animation, [[Image Engine]], (Vancouver), [[Intelligent Creatures]], (Toronto), Intrigue FX and [[Rainmaker Digital Effects]] (CIS) in Vancouver, being involved in the field. The National Film Board of Canada began to digitize its extensive archives and later in 2008 will announce the availability of its films on-line.

In Toronto, [[Cineplex Entertainment]], through Technicolor Digital Cinema has installed the Canadian made Christie CP2000 DLP Cinema projector in the [[Scotiabank Theatre Toronto|Scotiabank Theatre]] in Toronto, making it the first Canadian cinema operating this new technology, which provides sharp images and uncompressed digital sound. It can also project 3-D features with [[Real D Cinema]]. Cineplex plans to have 25 cinemas across Canada equipped with this new technology in the near future. A Montreal company, [[D-Box]] began to offer motion seats for cinemas in 2008. These seats physically move in a way designed to enhance the movie-going experience. The movement is induced by a digital signal specially embedded in the film which activates pistons in the seat that produce the physical movement. Canadian cinemas equipped with the devices in 2010 include, the Cinéma Beloeil, in Beloeil, Quebec and the Cineplex Odeon Queensway Theatre in Etobicoke, Ontario

Companies such as [[Electronic Arts]], [[Ubisoft Montreal]], BioWare and Next Level Games are active in the technologies related to the development and manufacture of [[video games]]. As of 2010 video game publishers and developers in Canada were found in major cities across the country including: Vancouver 47, Toronto 33, Montreal 22, Ottawa 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mazurkewich, Karen|publisher=Financial Post|title=The big app transition|date=29 July 2010|url=http://www.financialpost.com/transition/3338766/story.html#ixzz0wKPmgfhZ|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730090449/http://www.financialpost.com/transition/3338766/story.html|archivedate=July 30, 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wireless (mobile) Internet===
The use of mobile devices for accessing the Internet through a wireless local-area-network, [[wireless LAN]] in Canada has increased dramatically in recent years.

Geographic areas having access to a wireless local-area-network are often referred to as having [[Wi-Fi]] service.

By 2006 Internet providers began making "mobile" Internet connection available to their customers with companies such as Bell Canada offering their "unplugged" service. This type of service uses the laptop computer and plug-in modem to allow mobile Internet connection in many places across Canada. "Wireless" Internet communications have also been facilitated through the introduction of the widely popular [[Research In Motion]], [[BlackBerry]] handheld email and telephone machine and the introduction in 2008, by Rogers, of the "Rocket" wireless Internet stick for laptops.

In 2007 Canadian wireless carriers began to convert their DAVE! systems from the [[CDMA]] standard which restricted the user to service within North America to the [[GSM]] standard used by most carriers around the world. Videotron Telecom Ltee., one of the winners of the Canadian government wireless spectrum auction of 2008, announced that it would invest C$255 million to build a wireless network in Quebec, using the [[High Speed Packet Access]], (HSPA) technical standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Avery, Simon|title=Quebecor Media Bets Big on Mobile Phones|publisher= The Globe and Mail|date=23 October 2008|page=B5|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/quebecor-media-bets-big-on-mobile-phones/article20388715/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[3G]] wireless Internet technology became widely available to Canadians through national networks operated by [[Bell Mobility]], [[Rogers Communications|Rogers]], and [[Telus]]. The use of the [[Netbook]] a small portable computer that takes advantage of 3G technology to provide access the Internet became popular in Canada beginning in 2009.

As of 2009, the downloading of applications and data (music, videos, etc.) via [[smart phones|smartphone]] is becoming increasingly popular in Canada. The bandwidth represented by this use represents up to 40 time the bandwidth used by cellphones for voice calls, putting a tremendous load on existing cellphone networks and driving Rogers Communications Inc., Bell Canada and Telus to invest heavily in expanding the capacity of their networks.

In 2008 the government of Canada, as part of an effort to increase competition in the mobile communications industry, gave a number of new companies including, Public Mobile Holdings Inc., Globalive Communications Inc. and DAVE Wireless Inc. approval to establish new wireless operations in Canada to compete with the three incumbents. Bell Mobility introduced a smartphone with the Google developed Android operating system in 2009. In 2010 [[Google]] made its [[Nexus One]] available to Canadian consumers who can obtain these devices from [[Rogers Wireless]], [[Telus]], [[Bell Canada|Bell]] and [[Wind Mobile]].

As the result of a CRTC decision, cellphone providers in Canada, as of 2010, were able to locate within a radius of 300 metres, the geographic position of a handset used for making a 911 call.

In 2009, Canada's three cell phone companies, Rogers Communications Inc., Bell Canada and Telus created a jointly owned company, [[EnStream|Enstream LP]], which offers a cash transfer service via cellphone. To use the service the subscriber first downloads special software called [[Zoompass]], from Enstream to his or her phone. With this software, a Bell, Fido, PC Mobile, Rogers, Solo Mobile, or Telus subscriber can then withdraw up to $1000 daily from his bank account, or credit card account and transfer the amount to another subscriber who uses the same Zoompass software. Enstream plans to make the service increasingly flexible with the end goal of converting the cellphone into an electronic wallet or purse.&lt;ref&gt;Avery, Simon, Cellphone cash transfer service set to launch, The Globe and Mail, 13 June 2009, p. B2.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, Telus began offering the [[FaceTime]] service for its [[iPhone 4]] customers.&lt;ref&gt;Telus advertisement, back cover, Macleans, 23 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Foursquare (service)|Foursquare]], a cellphone-based mobile social networking service, was introduced to Canada in 2010. The service allows cellphone users to download the Foursquare software to their mobile phones and use it to stay connected with friends and colleagues using the same software and to obtain information on their physical location.

Telus Canada began offering a telephone service called [[Tigits]] across Canada in early 2011. Tigits provides a temporary anonymous telephone number for those who subscribe to the service. Developed by Toronto businessman, Sean Miller, Tigits allows the subscriber to protect his/her real number by giving the temporary Tigits number to others. When a Tigits subscriber calls the other person, the person called sees only the Tigits number on his digital display and not the real number of the person calling. When the other person calls the Tigits number of the Tigits subscriber the call is forwarded to the real number of the Tigits subscriber, thus protecting his/her anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=CBC|title=Tigits aims to make phone numbers safer|date=21 January 2011|url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2011/01/21/consumer-tigits.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital courts===
The University of Montreal has recently experimented with ways to improve the administration of justice by creating a digital court room in which mock trials are held using modern technology to speed the proceedings. The "courtroom" has facilities for filing documents electronically. Witnesses can testify by video link or holographically from a remote location.  Documents can be served on parties through social media. According to those involved with the project, barriers to its application in real courtroom settings are not technological but rather emotional, with judges and lawyers being resistant to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Graeme|last=Hamilton|title=Digitizing the Law|publisher=National Post|date=4 December 2010|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/news/Digitizing/3927481/story.html}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloud and quantum computing===
Evidence that cloud computing had begun to take hold in Canada by 2009 is reflected in the organization of the first Canadian Cloud Computing Conference held on 9 February of that year, in Toronto. [[Cloud computing]] involves the use of information processing and data storage on computers that are located away from the site of the user and owner of the data. The user, a corporation or individual, communicates with the remote computer through the Internet. The growing popularity of the small [[netbook]] computer is in part due to the fact that it is ideally suited to take advantage of cloud computing. The technique allows the user to focus more on processing and storage than on equipment and software acquisition and maintenance. However, it also raises questions relating to privacy and security, in that confidential data may be transmitted, processed and stored on facilities beyond the geographic reach of the owner of the data. Cloud computing providers offer three types of service, [[platform-as-a-service]] (PaaS), [[software-as-a-service]] (SaaS) and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). As of 2009, Toronto area companies appeared to be the leaders of cloud computing in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lewis, Rob|title=Toronto is Canada's Cloud Computing Capital|publisher=Tech Vibes|website=techvibes.com|date=17 August 2009|url=http://www.techvibes.com/blog/toronto-is-canadas-cloud-computing-capital}}&lt;/ref&gt; An initiative based in Kitchener/Waterloo has brought together a group of computer service providers to create Canadian Cloud Computing, which has developed the Trusted Canadian Cloud. This cloud computing service, which uses facilities based exclusively in Canada, was first demonstrated at Canada 3.0 Digital Media Conference held in Stratford, Ontario in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Website, Canadian Cloud Computing, ''So much for Our Low Profile'', www.canadiancloud.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quantum computing]] in Canada is also gaining a foothold as evidenced by [[D-Wave Systems]], a Burnaby-based quantum computing company founded in 1999 where in May 2013 it was announced that a collaboration between NASA, Google and the Universities Space Research Association (USRA) launched a [[Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab]] using a 512 [[qubit]] [[D-Wave Two]] that would be used for research into machine learning, among other fields of study. Though the field is still in its infancy, experiments have been carried out in which quantum computational operations were executed on a very small number of qubits. Both practical and theoretical research continues, and many national governments and military funding agencies support quantum computing research to develop quantum computers for both civilian and national security purposes, such as [[cryptanalysis]].&lt;ref name=MITreview&gt;{{cite news|last=Choi|first=Charles|title=Google and NASA Launch Quantum Computing AI Lab|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/514846/google-and-nasa-launch-quantum-computing-ai-lab/|newspaper=MIT Technology Review|date=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facial recognition technology===
The use of facial recognition technology (FRT) has grown in Canada in recent years. Nineteen of 27 Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation casinos, which receive 40,000,000 visitors a year, are using FRT to automatically identify 15,000 problem gamblers who have voluntarily placed themselves on a self-exclusion list. The Canadian Bankers Association has been using FRT since 2008 to investigate debit card fraud.  The Insurance Corporation of British Columbia has been using FRT since 2008 to counter fraudulent attempts by individuals to obtain a driver's license. In the summer of 2010, the technology was used by the Toronto Police to identify suspects wanted for vandalism or violent acts committed during the G-20 Summit there. The Department of Foreign Affairs has begun to issue e-passports with a chip that will enable the use of facial recognition technology beginning in 2012. Social media organizations such a Facebook, with millions of Canadian users have also adopted the use of FRT in their operations. All these applications and others raise privacy concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Globe and Mail|authors= Anita Elash, Anvivian Luk|title=Canadian casinos, banks, police use facial-recognition technology|date=26 July 2011|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/time-to-lead/canadian-casinos-banks-police-use-facial-recognition-technology/article590998/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internet television IPTV===
[[Internet television]] began to make inroads in Canada in 2009 with communications providers including, Bell TV, Telus, Rogers Communications and Quebecor (Videotron) investing in the Internet bandwidth necessary to provide their subscribers with TV programmes and movies. Bell TV and Rogers Communications Inc. introduced Internet TV to their subscribers in the fall of 2009. Telus began to offer its rebranded Optik, IPTV service in June 2010. That same month, Quebecor began to offer the Illico Web service with 32 channels (24 in French) to its subscribers through its Videotron subsidiary. The company has stated that the new service will eventually become a "mirror" of its TV offerings.  Bell began providing a rebranded IPTV service called Fibe, in September 2010. In 2010, Shaw Communications announced its intention to begin providing its customers with Internet TV. Halifax based [[EastLink (company)|EastLink]] is also investing in [[IPTV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Susan|last=Krashinsky|title=Vidéotron subscribers can now watch TV online|publisher=Globe and Mail|date=16 June 2010|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/videotron-subscribers-can-now-watch-tv-online/article1373290/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The delivery of movies and television programmes through the Internet in Canada was also given a boost with the introduction a streaming video Internet service by the US based [[Netflix]], via its Canadian server at  Netflix.ca in 2010. Canadian-owned movie delivery services were also introduced. Cineplex began to offer a movie download service and a streaming on-line Internet video service was introduced at Zip.ca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Susan|last=Krashinsky|title=Cineplex to unveil movie download service|publisher=Globe and Mail|date=18 November 2010|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/cineplex-to-unveil-movie-download-service/article1316263/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 3D TV ===
The first efforts towards providing Canadian viewers with [[3D TV]] were made in 2010. Early in the year two international consumer product manufacturers, Samsung and Sony began to market flat screen, digital, high definition, 3D television sets in Canada. The 3D effect is only available with the use of a pair of special glasses worn by the viewer. Each company has its own proprietary viewing standard, so that the glasses of one company cannot be used to view the 3D television of another.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Press, Samsung to start selling 3D TVs in Canada later this month, 10 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  DVD movies recorded in 3D provide what is, as yet, a limited source of programming.

Broadcasters also began to take steps to provide 3D programming to viewers equipped with these new 3D sets. The World Cup soccer championship played in South Africa was broadcast in 3D by the host broadcaster and the signal was offered in Canada by a number of TV providers. On 27 July 2010, the satellite delivered  [[Bell TV]] began to offer its subscribers a full-time 3D Oasis pay TV channel. The CBC also announced in August 2010 that it would broadcast the first Canadian produced 3D programme on 20 September 2010. It would be available to all viewers in Canada with an HD television set but the 3D effect would only be available when the programme was viewed with special glasses which will be distributed free at Canada Post Offices across Canada before the programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBC to test 3D broadcasting with doc on Queen|date=11 August 2010|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/cbc-to-test-3d-broadcasting-with-doc-on-queen/article1212957/|publisher=Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thought-controlled machines===
On 2 August 2010, a Toronto company, InteraXon, announced that it had developed technology to control machines by human thought. The technique involves the use of a head set to detect "alpha" and "beta" brain waves. The head set in turn produces a "control signal" that can be used to program electrical appliances ranging from lights to home appliances to computers. The technology was demonstrated at the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver, where visitors used their brain waves to control the lighting on three landmarks, the CN tower in Toronto, the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa and Niagara Falls. The technology is based on the research of Dr. Steve Mann, a University of Toronto professor who initially developed thought-controlled computing technology. The company foresees that the headset will evolve into a small wireless Bluetooth device that will be available in consumer electronics retail stores within two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian company develops thought-control technology|date=2 August 2010|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/canadian-company-develops-thought-control-technology-which-uses-brain-waves/article4251728/|publisher=Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communications: analog to digital technology===
Analog technology has dominated the history of the communications system in Canada for almost 160 years. It formed the basis for the telegraph, beginning in the 1850s, the telephone in the 1880s, recorded sound, the 20th century, radio, the 1920s, computers and television, the 1950s and cable TV in the 1960s.

However, digital technology has slowly replaced analog technology in all these domains in the past 40 years. The transformation began with the telephone system, in the 1970s and microchips and microcomputers in the early 1980s. Indeed, it was the combination of the telephone system and computers through a common digital link that permitted the latter machines to communicate with each other at distance. Further digital advances lead to the [[digital camera]], CD, DVD and mobile communications, later in that decade, the Internet in the 1990s as well as land based and satellite TV and radio, wireless communications etc., in the first decade of the new century.

With the CRTC mandated end to analog television broadcasting in Canada in August 2011, the analog age in Canada will for all practical purposes come to an end.

=== Transportation ===
Energy concerns have had a large impact on automobile manufacturers. Fuel efficient [[hybrid vehicles]] such as the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]], [[Saturn Vue]], [[Toyota Prius]], [[Toyota Camry Hybrid]], [[Toyota Highlander Hybrid]], [[Ford Escape Hybrid]], [[Honda Insight]] and [[Honda Civic Hybrid]] have become available to Canadian consumers since the start of the 21st century and the rising cost of gasoline is making them increasingly attractive in spite of their generally higher cost. As of 2009, the [[Ford Fusion Hybrid]] was the most fuel efficient mid-sized car available in Canada. In 2008 Ford Canada began the operation of the Flex assembly line, using the Flex technique at its plant in Oakville, Ontario. This technology allows the production of three different automobile types, in this case, the Ford Edge, the Ford Flex and the Ford Lincoln MKX, on the same assembly line. In 2004 Mercedes-Benz introduced the diminutive and fuel efficient [[Smart Fortwo]] automobile to the Canadian market. Multinational car manufacturers have also announced their intentions to introduce the all-electric car to world markets including Canada. General Motors has announced the availability of its [[Chevrolet Volt]] in Canada in 2011 as has Mitsubishi for its [[MiEV]], while Nissan has announced the Canadian introduction of the [[Nissan Leaf]] in 2012.

The management of automobile traffic in large urban areas through the use of "smart" electronic traffic management systems has become popular in recent years. Such systems are now in place in Toronto (1993), Ottawa, Calgary and Halifax. The city of Montreal will take the first steps for the installation of such a system in 2011. 500 video cameras and other street and highway mounted sensors will provide information for a central computer which will be used to control traffic lights to improve traffic flow and reduce accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=La Presse|title=Un cerveau électronique pour gérer la circulation|date=20 January 2011|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/montreal/201101/19/01-4361781-un-cerveau-electronique-pour-gerer-la-circulation.php|last=Benessaieh|first=Karim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another traffic management tool involves the use of satellite tracking. Promoted by a Toronto company, Skymeter Corp, but not yet deployed in Canada, the system, a type of toll road in the sky, is designed to reduce traffic jams through the use of automobile based transponder/GPS systems and satellites. The satellite tracks the route of a particular vehicle at a particular time and then charges the user based on a systems of "tolls" based on the roads taken and the time of day. The tolls are publicized for users and designed to encourage road use in a way that minimizes traffic jams. The computerized billing system keeps an account of the charges and bills the customer incurs on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Andrew|last=Coyne|url=http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/stuck-in-traffic/|title=Stuck in traffic|publisher=Macleans|volume=124|number=1|date=17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the City of Montreal began to deploy 800 wireless, networked, solar-powered, Linux based, electronic parking payment stations to replace up to 10,000 existing mechanical parking meters. Each parking space has a code and the motorist can pay the required parking rate, with cash or credit card, from any station in the city (he/she must of course remember his code). The system, developed by 8D Technologies of Quebec also allows metre maids to check for parking violations by wirelessly interrogating a parking station with a hand-held device from his/her vehicle. The devise provides a digital map of all parking spaces near the station and marks those spaces with vehicles in violation with a red symbol. Other cities across Canada are installing similar machines.&lt;ref&gt;dailywireless.org, Electronic Parking Meters, 5 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A light-rail urban passenger train known as the [[O-Train]], began operation in Ottawa in 2001 providing limited service in a north-south corridor, today's [[Trillium Line]]. There are plans to expand the system to serve the downtown core as well as the western and eastern suburbs of the city by 2016.

[[Global Positioning System|Global positioning technology]] has become an important feature of business and consumer life. After 23 years of military development, the U.S. military global positioning system became operational in 1995. Originally designed for the precise targeting of weapons and other military purposes, the U.S. government made the system available to civilians in 1996. Industrial users such as transportation companies and resource companies began to make use of the technology for the tracking of vehicles and the location of field operations. Receivers for the consumer market, were also produced and made available in Canada and became popular with outdoorsmen and women. In 2004 a GPS feature became available on some mobile phones and stand alone units for car navigation were available to Canadians by 2008.

The 11 September 2001 terrorist attack on the U.S. has resulted in increased security along the Canada-U.S. border. In 2004, Canada and the U.S. signed the Canada-U.S. Agreement on Science and Technology Cooperation for Critical Infrastructure Protection and Border Security designed to speed the introduction of a number of electronic, wireless, computer and detection technologies to scrutinize cross-border traffic while at the same time limiting the disruption to the flow of people and goods. The use of these technologies is particularly important at the Windsor Detroit border crossing which is the busiest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geo.international.gc.ca/can-am/main/border/status-en.asp Foreign Affairs and International Trade]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the Government of Canada announced the initiation of two important transportation projects. In the first instance the government stated that it will acquire, for the [[Canadian Coast Guard]], a new $700 million, [[CCG Polar Class icebreaker]] for patrolling the Northwest Passage. The ship will enter service in 2017. The government also announced the construction of a second international bridge between Windsor, Ontario and Detroit, Michigan, to help relieve the pressure on the heavily overloaded, 80-year-old [[Ambassador Bridge]]. The $5 billion project will include connections from the Canadian ends of both bridges to the nearby [[Highway 401 (Ontario)]]. As of December 2010 construction had yet to start.

The field of transportation also saw the Premiers of Ontario and Quebec in 2007 talking of yet another study of a high speed train in the [[Quebec City – Windsor Corridor]].

Between 2006 and 2009, Air Canada "made over" the cabins of all its aircraft providing each passenger seat with a number of new technologies including, a Personal AVOD (with a 230&amp;nbsp;mm touch-screen LCD) offering 200 hours of video and audio entertainment, interactive games, 
a three-prong 120 V AC plug for laptops, a USB port and [[XM Radio Canada]]. The largest airplane in the world the [[Airbus A380]], in this case operated by [[Emirates Airline]], began regular service between Toronto's [[Lester B. Pearson Airport]] and Dubai in 2009. By 2009, most major airports in Canada were equipped with stand alone self-service customer check-in kiosks, which provided the passenger with a boarding pass for his/her flight. This represented the further extension of the technique known as the e-ticket which became the standard for purchasing an aircraft ticket several years earlier. In January 2010, the Government of Canada announced the use of [[full body scanner]] for the security checking of passengers boarding planes in Canada bound for the US. The scanners will be installed at the airports in Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Halifax. The use of [[biometrics]] will become an important technique in the screening of those wishing to enter Canada. It is planned that between 2011 and 2013 the Department of Immigration and Citizenship will begin to deploy digital face and fingerprint scanning systems at overseas Canadian Visa offices for the issuance of visas to those who intending to visit Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Curry, Bill|title=Ottawa to seek biometric data on all visitors|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=10 June 2009|page=10|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/ottawa-to-seek-biometric-data-on-visitors/article1198876/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Air navigation coverage has recently been improved through the deployment of Automated Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) technology in parts of northern Canada. First introduced in the Hudson Bay area in January 2009, the service will eventually be expanded to cover all of northern Canada. The technique involves the use of ground-based transmitter/receivers and special electronic equipment aboard aircraft flying through northern airspace. This special equipment automatically transmits information relating to the aircraft position (determined by a GPS on the airplane) every second, to the ground-based receiving station, a number of which are located in the north. The station then transmits this information to an area control centre, operated by Nav Canada, Canada's national air navigation system operator, where the it is displayed on "radar" screens which are used by air traffic controllers to monitor Canadian airspace.&lt;ref&gt;Brochure, ADS-B Hudson Bay Implementation, Nav Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of the [[shipping container]] has been emphasized by recent developments in Winnipeg. "CentrePort Canada, an 8,000-hectare inland port being developed on the city’s edge is a one-stop shop for air, truck and rail shipments and is designed to reroute North American trade through the middle of the country...CentrePort (recently) announced an agreement with two Chinese partners, including the country’s largest private shipping company, Minsheng International Freight Co....(that)...will create a new container-based rail system that will quickly move crops from the Canadian prairies into the Chinese market." Rail services will be provided by Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway. A new highway, the CentrePort Canada Way, is under construction to divert the heavy truck traffic associated with the new facility away from urban roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Siri|last=Agrell|title=Winnipeg working to regain role as transportation ‘gateway to the West’|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=22 May 2011|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/winnipeg-working-to-regain-role-as-transportation-gateway-to-the-west/article4247831/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy and mega oil ===
In this century, the largest engineering undertaking by far is the [[tar sands]] project in northern Alberta. This has seen the investment of up to $60 billion to develop and build gigantic tar sand mining, transportation, separation and refining facilities to produce oil from the gritty bitumen tar. The project is highly controversial for a number of reasons not the least of which is environmental. As of 2005, operations included the Suncor Mine, Syncrude Mine, Shell Canada Mine and others producing 760,000 barrels of oil a day. A large number of corporations from a number of countries plan to invest in the tar sands, including Suncor Energy, Syncrude, Shell/Chevron/Marathon, and Petro-Canad. Recovery techniques include [[steam-assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD) and cyclic steam stimulation (CSS). More recently Cenovus Energy of Calgary has developed the "Solvent Aided Process" SAP for heavy oil recovery. This involved injecting butane or other organic solvent, along with steam into a horizontal chamber dug in the oil sands. The solvent and steam allow the oil to flow into another chamber below the first. It is then pumped to the surface from this chamber.&lt;ref name="future"&gt;The Future of Energy, Information Supplement, Macleans, 23 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Oil sands recovery techniques create huge amounts of [[Tailings|contaminated waste water]], which is stored in "tailing ponds". In 2010, there were about 170 square kilometres of these ponds in the oil sands region of Alberta. Left to a normal process of degradation it would take decades for this waste to become environmentally safe. On 27 August 2010, Shell Canada announced the opening of a commercial plant designed to speed the cleaning of the waste in these ponds, at its oil sands production facility in Alberta. The plant uses a technique developed by Shell Canada at a cost of C$30 million. Known as "atmospheric fines drying" or AFD, it takes the thick liquid output of the oil production process and over a period of several weeks with the use of a special flocculant and drying techniques, reduces it to a safe dirt-like compound. Shell Canada is making this technology available free of charge to other oil sands production companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Globe and Mail|first=Nathan|last=VanderKlippe|title=Shell opens plant to clean up oil sands|date=26 August 2010|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/shell-opens-plant-to-clean-up-oil-sands/article1213249/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shale gas====
{{Main|Shale gas in Canada}}
Geological formations of [[shale gas]] are being explored as a new source of energy. A technique known as [[horizontal drilling]] is used to create a horizontal bore hole, through a formation. Water under high pressure is then pumped into the bore hole where it fractures the shale and allows the gas to escape the rock and seep up the bore hole. There are a number of shale gas fields in Canada including the Shallow Colorado basin in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, the Bakken, in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, the Antrim in Southern Ontario and the Utica in south east Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;Newsletter, Shale Gas Outlook Until 2020, ziff Energy Group - Global Energy Advisors,  8 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The technique is not without problems for the fracturing can affect aquifers causing contamination and deviation. To date efforts at production in Canada have been limited to exploratory wells.

Canaport, the first [[Liquefied natural gas|liquified natural gas]] (LNG) port terminal facility of its kind in Canada, began operation in Saint John, New Brunswick in 2009. LNG is seen as a substitute for conventional gas.&lt;ref&gt;O'Meara, Dina, Canadport: Right place, wrong time, National Post, 27 June 2009, p. FP4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the Government of Ontario announced plans for the construction of two new reactors at the existing Darlington nuclear power facility, but suspended the project in 2009. Competing designs included the ACR-1000 by Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., the EPR by the French company Areva Group and the AP1000 by the US based Westinghouse Electric Co. Llc.. The government of Saskatchewan is considering the construction of two nuclear reactors in Lloydminster and the government of New Brunswick is proposing the addition of another reactor at its Point Lepreau nuclear power facility.

====Renewable energy and sustainability concerns====
In 2006, the Government of Ontario instructed the provincial hydro utility to provide all of its customers with digital smart hydro meters by 2010 as a first step towards the creation of a [[Smart Grid]], which would conserve electricity. The project had been largely completed as of that date. In BC, BC Hydro announced in 2010 the replacement of existing hydro metres with digital smart meters for its 1.8 million residential and commercial customers, by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Scott|last=Simpson|title=Smart Metres Nip Illegal Practice in the Bud|newspaper=Vancouver Sun|date=8 August 2010|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=f9251858-5263-4f11-b3b6-2b9ff5777cfb|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201064636/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=f9251858-5263-4f11-b3b6-2b9ff5777cfb|archivedate=1 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vancouver, the Vancouver Fuel Cell Vehicle Program, a pilot project, was introduced in 2005 to study the use of [[hydrogen]] as a power source for cars. The three-year undertaking, a first in Canada for [[fuel cell]] powered automobiles, studies the operation of a fleet of five Ford Focus FCV’s (fuel cell vehicles), in "real world" conditions, in Vancouver and Victoria.  The project is the initiative of a consortium made up of the Governments of Canada and British Columbia, Fuel Cells Canada, and Ford Motor Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vfcvp.gc.ca/index_e.html The Vancouver Fuel Cell Vehicle Programme]&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns with energy efficiency have also led to the introduction of the [[compact fluorescent lamp]] for domestic, commercial and industrial use and the federal government stated in 2007 that the sale of incandescent light bulbs would be phased out by 2012. The technology of the [[LED]] lamp has been known for a century. In recent years{{When|date=November 2015}}, it has become a popular replacement for incandescent bulbs because of its low power consumption. RenewABILITY Energy of Waterloo has developed a technique for recovering heat from domestic waste water. Known as the Power-Pipe, it channels hot waste water through cold water waiting to be used and heats it.&lt;ref name="future"/&gt;

=====Biofuels and coal=====
The use of clean-burning biofuels such as [[ethanol]] has become significant in recent years{{When|date=November 2015}}. At the present time{{When|date=November 2015}}, Canada's largest manufacturers of ethanol include GreenField Ethanol and Husky Energy, which produce 500 million litres and 260 million litres of ethanol a year respectively from corn and wheat. Other companies are also at work in the field, including [http://www.enerkem.com Enerkem] of Montreal, which makes ethanol from old telephone poles at a facility in Westbury, Quebec and Iogen of Ottawa, which makes cellulosic ethanol from wheat straw. Since 2007, the Government of Ontario has required that all gasoline sold in the province contains at least 5% ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=CBC|title=Ontario to require 5% ethanol in gas by 2007|url=http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/ontario-to-require-5-ethanol-in-gas-by-2007-1.514484}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A federal regulatory change in 2009 will require all oil refiners in Canada to provide an ethanol content of at least 5% in their gasoline by September 2010. The [[Fischer-Tropsch]] process is the basis for a proposal by AP Fuels of Montreal to establish five biorefineries in Canada. The plan calls for the use of this technique to transform certain types of trees, notably popular and birch, into gas and then to liquid-biodiesel, which burns with reduced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; output.&lt;ref&gt;Yakabuski, Konrad, The Globe and Mail, 18 June 2009, P. B1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology of "clean" coal has also become important. Western Canada has abundant [[coal]] supplies but the use of coal in recent years has been criticized for environmental reasons. To counter this criticism, coal and coal-fired electricity producers have formed the Canadian Clean Power Coalition. This organization promotes a number of projects which use a variety of "clean" coal technologies. These include the EPCOR Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plant for the Genesse Power Station in Alberta. The IGCC plant gasifies coal and uses the clean gas to drive a [[gas turbine]]. The process also produces steam, which is used to turn a [[steam turbine]]. Both turbines are used to produce electricity. The process also captures CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the gas combustion, which is in turn used for [[enhanced oil recovery]] or is sequestered underground.&lt;ref&gt;The Globe and Mail, Monday 8 June 2009, p. CCT1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Wind and solar power=====
Energy concerns have inspired the development of wind farms that use modern [[windmills]] to generate electricity from this renewable resource. One of the first modern windmills was built at Cap Chat in Quebec in the eighties, but most wind farms have been built since 2000. As of 2008, 10 megawatt wind farms in Canada were distributed as follows: Alberta 10, Quebec 5, Ontario 5, PEI 4, Saskatchewan 3, Manitoba 2 and Nova Scotia 2. In 2008 Hydro-Québec announced the construction of 1000 windmills at 15 new sites located mostly in the St. Lawrence River Valley. By 2015, that utility expects that 10% of the province's electricity will be provided by wind power. In 2008, in British Columbia, BC Hydro has issued a Clean Power Call for proposals for environmentally friendly energy production and one company, Naikun Wind Energy, has responded with Canada’s first plan to develop off-shore wind power by installing windmills at sea in the Hecate Strait off the north coast of B.C.

In 2010, the Government of Ontario signed an agreement with Samsung and the Korea Electric Power Corporation to build and operate wind and solar electrical generating farms across southern Ontario. The C$5 to C$7 billion project is described as the largest of its type in the world and will begin with installations in Chatham-Kent and Essex-Haldimand counties in southwestern Ontario. It is foreseen that the wind turbines will generate up to 2,000 MW and the solar power facilities up to 500 MW. This will permit the closure of all of the coal-fired electric generating plants in Ontario by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=National Post|url=http://www.financialpost.com/related/topics/Ontario+signs+green+energy+deal+with+Samsung+team/2468582/story.html|title=Ontario signs green energy deal with Samsung team|date=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
A private company, OptiSolar Farms Canada Inc., is using silicon [[solar panels]] to develop what will become the largest solar power farm in North America. The facility, under construction in a field near Sarnia, will begin to produce 60 megawatts of electricity for Ontario consumers by the end of 2008.

=====Geothermal energy=====
The use of [[geothermal energy]] has grown in Canada in recent years although its overall importance as an energy source is still very small. The use of geothermal energy in Canada falls into two broad categories: commercial use to produce electricity and consumer use for home heating. In Canada, the former is limited to a facility in Meager Mountain British Columbia, a site with a potential for 100–250 MW, which has recently (2010) begun to produce for the BC Hydro grid. In the case of consumer use, a hole similar to that used for a domestic water well is drilled in the ground near the residence in question. Water is pumped to the surface and passed through a heat exchanger where some of its heat is removed and transferred to a closed loop water system in the house. The cooler water is then returned to the ground. The water in the closed loop is circulated throughout the structure where it passes through radiators and heats the house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pembina.org The Pembina Institute: Renewable Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waste management, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and cogeneration ===
The undesirable environmental effects of industrial processes and atmospheric pollution in particular, have become a topic of increasing public concern in the new millennium. Among the most notable polluters in Canada in 2006 were electric power generators: ATCO, Emera (Nova Scotia Power), Ontario Power Generation, SaskPower and TransAlta, mining companies: HudBay Minerals, Teck Cominco, Vale Inco and Xstrata, oil and gas companies: Imperial Oil, Shell Canada, and Trans Canada, oil sands companies: Syncrude and Suncor and the manufacturing enterprise, SMC Canada.&lt;ref&gt;McClearn, Matthew, ''What Are Canada’s Industrial Polluters Doing to Reduce Emissions'', Canadian Business Magazine, 27 October 2008, pp. 55-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to reduce the release of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas into the atmosphere lead to the initiation of the [[Weyburn-Midale Carbon Dioxide Project|Weyburn-Midale CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Project]] in Saskatchewan in 2000. Presently the world’s largest [[CO2 sequestration|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sequestration]] effort, this $80 million undertaking involves the injection of waste CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas from industrial processes into the ground for storage instead its release into the atmosphere. There are presently two underground sequestration facilities, one at Weyburn operated by Encana and the other at Midale operated by Apache Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ptrc.ca/weyburn_overview.php|title=Weyburn-Midale CO2 Project|publisher=Petroleum Technology Research Centre|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217113553/http://www.ptrc.ca/weyburn_overview.php|archivedate= February 17, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years bio-waste has been used for the production of heat and electricity. Sanitary landfill sites are notable in this regard. Often, systems for the collection of methane gas are progressively installed as the sites are filled. This gas is then used at on site [[cogeneration]] facilities for the production of heat and electricity. A number of landfill sites including those in Kanata, Petrolia, Watford and Napanee, Ontario and Sainte-Sophie, Drummondville and Magog in Quebec have been selected for the location of  cogeneration facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Houston firm planning to harness the methane from dumps in Canada |publisher=Toronto Star |date=28 June 2007 |url=https://www.thestar.com/Business/article/230243 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630190504/http://www.thestar.com/Business/article/230243 |archivedate=June 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Ottawa the cogeneration facility at the Pickard (Sewage Treatment) Centre which has been in operation since 1998, provides all the heat and electrical energy needed to operate the centre.

Ostara Nutrient Recovery Technologies Inc. of Vancouver has developed techniques to recover [[phosphorus]] and other nutrients from waste water. Since 2007, these have been put to use at the Gold Bar Treatment Plant in Edmonton, the world's first industrial scale waste-water nutrient treatment facility. The recovered products are recycled and sold as environmentally safe commercial fertilizer. Other Ostara nutrient recovery projects are underway at Lulu Island (Vancouver), Penticton, B.C. and in the US.&lt;ref&gt;website, www.ostara.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Materials and industrial processes – 3D printing ===
Efforts to save fuel have also led to efforts to reduce the weight of vehicles through the increased use of [[composite material]]. [[Aircraft manufacturer]]s have been especially notable in this regard and produced new large but relatively light aircraft such as the Boeing [[B-787]] Dreamliner with this new material. Orders for this new machine have been made by a number of major world airlines, including [[Air Canada]]. In 2008, Bombardier of Montreal announced the production of the new C Series of 100- to 130-seat passenger jets which will also make extensive use of composites. They will also be used extensively in the 7000 and 8000 series of long range business jets announced by that company in 2010.

[[3D printing]] has become an important industrial process in Canada. The technique uses a computer to drive the 3D printing device. This machine builds 3D shaped objects through successive passes of a "printing head" which lays down layers of plastic or other material to progressively build a 3D physical object. As of 2010, about 100, 3D printers were in use with manufacturing enterprises in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Keith|last=Norbury|publisher=The Globe and Mail|title=3D Printers: Press the Button and Make Anything|date=8 November 2010|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-digital/biz-categories-technology/3-d-printers-press-a-button-and-make-anything/article1241413/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The techniques of [[diamond mining]] have been introduced to Canada in recent years. Over 600 kimberlite formations have been found throughout Canada. Open pit mining techniques have been used to produce diamonds from two of these, Ekati, beginning in 1998 and Diavik in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbendi.com Diamond Mining in Canada - Overview] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19981207000832/http://www.mbendi.com/ |date=1998-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nanotechnology===
[[Nanotechnology]] involves the manipulation of atoms and molecules to produce processes and products for human use. At present, the field is the subject of much research, but the use of these processes and products in Canada is not yet widespread. However the technology remains important because of its potential for great future influence. Some nano-products have made their way to the market in items such as cosmetics, and certain industrial products available in Canada.

Most of the activity in Canada is found in research. In 2001, the Canadian government established the [[National Institute for Nanotechnology]] in Edmonton. The Institute conducts nano-research in a number of fields including the life sciences, supramolecular assembly, molecular scale devices and nano-sensors. As of 2010, a number of Canadian universities offer engineering degrees in nanotechnology. Of particular note is the [[Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology]] which will be in operation in 2011 and will conduct research related to nano-engineered materials, nano-electronics design and fabrication, nano-instrumentation and nano-biosystems.

The use of nanomaterials is not without controversy. As of February 2009, the Government of Canada requires all industries to report the use of nanomaterials in their products. In 2010 the government banned the use of manufactured nano-materials and nanotechnology in organic food production.&lt;ref&gt;Website, Friends of the Earth Nanotechnology Project, ''Canada bans nano in organics'', nano.foe.org.au&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture, public works and heavy engineering===
The construction of skyscrapers has continued apace in recent years with Toronto and Calgary accounting for most of the new structures. These include: [[Bankers Hall]] West, Calgary, 2000, the [[TransCanada Tower, Calgary]], 2001, [[One Wall Centre]], Vancouver, 2001, [[One King Street West]], Toronto, 2005, West 1, Toronto, 2005, Harbourview Estates 2, Toronto, 2005, Residences of College Park 1, Toronto, 2006, [[Living Shangri-La]], Vancouver, 2008, the Hilton Fallsview Hotel Tower, Niagara Falls, 2008, Quantum 2 ([[Minto Midtown]]), Toronto, 2008, the [[Bay Adelaide Centre]] West, Toronto, 2009, the [[RBC Centre]], Toronto, 2009, Success, Toronto, 2009, Montage, Toronto, 2009, the Ritz-Carlton, Toronto, 2010, [[Centennial Place (Calgary)|Centennial Place]], Calgary, 2010, [[Maple Leaf Square]] North and South, Toronto, 2010, [[Jamieson Place]], Calgary, 2010, Festival Tower, Toronto, 2010, [[The Bow (skyscraper)]], Calgary, 2011, [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Toronto)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]], Toronto, 2011, [[The Uptown Residences]], Toronto, 2011, [[Eighth Avenue Place (Calgary)]], 2011, the Four Seasons, Toronto, 2011, The Private Residences, Vancouver, 2011, the Burano, Toronto, 2011, [[Absolute World]] North and South, Mississauga, 2011, the Marriott Courtyard Hotel, Montreal, 2012, the [[Shangri-La Toronto]], 2012, and the [[L Tower]], Toronto, 2012.

New hydro-electric projects have been completed as well including the 230-MW Rocher-de-Grand-Mère station, on Quebec's Saint-Maurice River (2004).

New bridges and roads of note include the [[Golden Ears Bridge]], Vancouver, 2009, the [[Middle Arm Bridge]], Vancouver, 2009 the [[North Arm Bridge]], Vancouver, 2009 and the [[Sea to Sky Highway]], Vancouver/Whistler, 2009. In 2009, in northern Quebec, Hydro-Québec initiated construction of the C$6 billion Romaine River Complex, a series of four rock filled hydro generating dams that will be completed between 2014 and 2020.&lt;ref&gt;Website, ENR.com, enr.ecnext.com., Hydro-Québec Launches Four-Dam Project on Romaine River, 17 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A different type of public facility was introduced to the citizens of Toronto in 2010, when the city approved a contract for the installation of 20 self-cleaning public toilets. The first of their kind in Canada, each of the devices, which are placed throughout the city, resembles a bus shelter. The user pays 25 cents for twenty minutes of occupancy. The facility cleans itself automatically after each use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=National Post|title=Toronto’s new automatic pay toilet is flush-tastic, but chilly|date=19 May 2010|author=Potkins, Meghan|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/posted-toronto/torontos-new-automatic-pay-toilet-is-flush-tastic-but-cold}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medicine ===
In 2001, the Federal government created [[Canada Health Infoway]], in independent, not-for-profit, federally funded organization composed of the 14 Canadian federal, provincial and territorial Deputy Ministers of health. Infoway has a mandate to accelerate the Canada-wide use of electronic health records and electronic health information systems. As of 2008, more than $1.3 billion has been invested in the system. By 2010, Infoway plans to have electronic health records for 50% of the population available to authorized health professionals, and expects to have electronic health records for all Canadians by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoway-inforoute.ca/en/Home/home.aspx Canada Health Infoway]&lt;/ref&gt; The project involves undertakings in a number of fields, including diagnostic imaging systems, drug information systems, telehealth, laboratory information systems and public health surveillance.

Telus, one of Canada's largest telephone companies, announced an agreement with Microsoft of Canada for the use of the latters' [[HealthVault]] (2007) consumer health records software in 2009. Telus intends to use the software to allow its 11 million Canadian subscribers to access information relating to their health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Globe and Mail|work=www.theglobeandmail.com|title= Telus, Microsoft hook up on health system|date=7 May 2009|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/telus-microsoft-hook-up-on-health-system/article1195921/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical technology in Ontario was improved in 2009 with the implementation of the government operated ePrescribing system a service that allows doctors to send prescriptions for patient pharmaceuticals directly to the pharmacist through a private computer network. This technique eliminates the problem with illegible handwriting, thus improving patient safety. The system has been initially introduced in Sault Ste. Marie and Collingwood with plans for making it available province-wide by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=ctv.ca|title=Ontario to test e-prescribing system|date=13 May 2009|url=http://toronto.ctvnews.ca/ontario-to-test-e-prescribing-system-1.397981}}&lt;/ref&gt; eHealth Ontario, announced in 2010, the signing of a C$46 million contract for the establishment of a diabetes registry, for the management of patients with this disease. The registry will eventually be expanded for the management of patients with other chronic diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Financial Post |title=eHealth Ontario and CGI sign $46.2M contract|date=9 August 2010|url=http://toronto.ctvnews.ca/ehealth-to-cancel-46-2m-diabetes-registry-contract-1.961974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, Real Time Radiology (based in Mississauga, Ontario) has provided interpretation of medical images to remote sites on a Canada-wide basis. Through use of the Internet and a highly automated computer process, a team of 50 radiologists working for the company across Canada interprets medical images sent from distant locations where the services of a radiologist are not available. The results are returned electronically to the remote locations and form the basis for patient treatment there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Globe and Mail|first=Paul |last=Brent|title=Brainchild puts medical talent on the 'Net|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-digital/biz-categories-technology/brainchild-puts-medical-talent-on-the-net/article4329657/|date=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gattuso Rapid Diagnostic Centre at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto, through the acquisition of new diagnostic equipment that can prepare tissue samples for pathological analysis within hours, began offering same day breast cancer diagnosis for patients in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Globe and Mail|website=www.theglobeandmail.com|title=Program puts end to an agonizing wait: Hospital offers same-day cancer diagnosis|date=7 May 2009|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/program-puts-end-to-an-agonizing-wait-hospital-offers-same-day-cancer-diagnosis/article1197208/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Techniques for the mass production of drugs were improved in the early part of the new century. In Ste. Foy, Quebec, the international drug maker GlaxoSmithKline established a manufacturing complex for the mass production of vaccines. As of 2009, the facility is capable of producing 14,000,000 doses per month. The facility may be used for the production of a vaccine for the H1N1 flu virus for the entire [[population of Canada]] (around 35,000,000 people as of 2014), should that become necessary. Also in 2009, public preparations for a possible pandemic included the placement of containers of liquid [[hand sanitizer]] for use in public places.

The PharmaTrust prescription medication dispending machine was introduced to the Canadian public in 2008. The apparatus, which physically resembles and functions like an ATM or soft drink dispenser, allows a user to purchase and receive medically approved prescription drugs, without visiting a pharmacy. Developed by PCA Services Inc. of Oakville, Ontario, one of the first has been installed in the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Perkins, Tara|title=A prescription for convenience|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=23 June 2009|page=B8|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-digital/innovation/a-prescription-for-convenience/article4301370/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lasers]] made their way into routine dentistry by the middle of the first decade, offering faster treatments, less pain and more precise results. They are used to remove tartar, treat soft tissues such as gums and to prepare cavities for filling. Of particular interest in the latter instance is the fact that this treatment is so painless that the use of a needle to inject a local anesthetic is usually unnecessary. Laser treatment results in little bleeding, a lower risk of infection and a quicker healing. Another innovation was the use of computer milled ceramic implants for repairing cavities. The use of a non-toxic chemical such as hydrogen peroxide or [[carbamide peroxide]] for [[tooth bleaching]] has become popular in the new century.

In 2002, two Vancouver doctors, dermatologist Alastair Carruthers and ophthalmologist Jean Carruthers, pioneered the cosmetic use of the well known [[botulinum toxin]]. The pair noticed that subcutaneous injections of small amounts of the toxin had the effect of removing age wrinkles from the skin. The [[Botox]] procedure, as it became known, quickly gained popularity around the world.

Commercial [[DNA profiling]] has become available in Canada in recent years. For a fee, it is possible to order a number of specific tests including those for paternity, maternity, siblingship and ancestry. Companies offering this service include Genetrack Biolabs established in Vancouver, B.C. in 2003 and DNA Canada of Kingston, Ontario, established in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040216132935/http://www.dnacanada.ca/ DNA Canada website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 2002 in Burnaby, British Columbia, Lifebank Cryogenics Corporation provides, on a commercial basis, a client-based service for the processing and cryogenic storage of stem cells from the umbilical cords of new-born babies. The cells may be of help in the treatment of disease that might affect the donor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifebank.com Lifebank Cryogenics Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic and consumer technology ===
{{Original research|section|date=January 2015}}
Domestic construction has witnessed the introduction of improved building techniques and the smart home ([[home automation]]). Both the hydraulic lift  and the concrete pump/crane, are now commonly used for home construction. Furthermore, homes are built with the electronics necessary for Internet connection throughout the premises. Household systems, such as heating and cooling, lighting, communications, entertainment and even food storage and cooking are now all linked to each other through the web. In the kitchen the glass-topped stove has become popular. The living room has seen the introduction of the very large flat screen, digital [[plasma TV]], [[LCD TV]] and [[LED]] TV technologies, which have undergone dramatic price reduction in the last few years{{When|date=January 2015}} and have replaced the cathode-ray TV in consumer appliance/electronic stores. Also popular with consumers is the [[iPod]] portable music player introduced to Canadians in 2001 and the [[iPhone]] which was made available to Canadians by [[Rogers Wireless]] in 2008. The [[digital camera]] which was introduced to Canadians in the eighties has for the most part replaced the film camera in recent years. The electronic book or [[E-book]] has gained a place in Canada beginning with the introduction of the [[Sony Librie]] reader in 2004 and the [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] in 2009. In 2010 the [[iPad]] wireless web surfing device became available to Canadians. Other such devices have been introduced in Canada including the [[BlackBerry PlayBook]] (available in 2011). The [[Blu-ray Disc]] and associated player have been marketed in Canada since 2009. The ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' music video game released in 2007 has enjoyed great success in Canada as has the [[Wii]] video game released that same year.

Although 3D video games based on [[anaglyph image]] technology have been available in Canada since their introduction to the market in 1987, their popularity increased in 2009 partly as a result of marketing efforts by the maker of the 3D film ''Avatar''. Popular formats include [[Windows]] (3D), [[PS3]] (3D), [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]], Wii, [[Xbox 360]] (3D), [[Nintendo DS|DS]] and [[iPhone]]. Users must wear special glasses with a different coloured lens over each eye in order to experience the 3D effect.

In 2008, the large Canadian banks, including the Bank of Nova Scotia, the Royal Bank of Canada, the Toronto-Dominion Bank and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, began issuing [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] credit cards with an embedded microchip for enhanced security. Also in 2008, MasterCard Canada introduced the [[PayPass]] electronic payment system to Canada. The system uses a card/tag/phone equipped with an embedded computer chip and radio frequency antennae which is tapped on a PayPass reader at participating grocery stores, convenience stores, fast food restaurants or gas stations. The card/tag/phone, wirelessly transmits information about the customer to the reader which in turn electronically charges the appropriate sum to the customer's account. A similar concept using cell phones equipped with Near Field Communications (NFC) was introduced in 2009.  Known as [[payWave]], the technique is the result of cooperation between Visa, the Royal Bank of Canada and Rogers Communications. It is intended for fast, mobile, low-cost "micro-payment" transactions of items such as fast food, coffee, and subway tokens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kritsonis, Ted|work=Globe and Mail|title=Will consumers use a Visa phone?|date=24 November 2009|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/will-consumers-use-a-visa-phone/article4293480/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2006, [[omega-3]] oil became an additive in a number of foods sold in Canada.

The personal blood level alcohol tester or [[breathalyser]] was introduced to Canadians in 2010. The device, known as the BAQ Tracker, works the same way as those used by police. The user blows into a tube on the small portable hand-held machine and a digital readout of his or her blood alcohol level instantly appears on a display. Developed by Ladybug Technologies of Cambridge, Ontario, it sells for about $300.&lt;ref&gt;Adam McDowell, Know Your Limit (to three decimal places), ''National Post'', 4 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Defence and security ===
In the 21st century, Canada's government has shown renewed interest in the acquisition of military technology, especially with its commitment to the war in Afghanistan. Equipment has been improved, including the CF-18 fighter with addition of [[laser-guided bombs]] and there are plans to update the Aurora patrol aircraft. The air force has also taken possession of the gigantic new [[C-17 Globemaster III]] long-range transport aircraft and has begun to renew the fleet of Hercules transport aircraft. The army has acquired the new [[Leopard 2]] tank and C-777 long-range gun, and in 2009 announced the acquisition of the Close Combat Vehicle. In 2003, the Forces took possession of their first tactical [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (TUAV), the French-designed CU-161 Sperwer, and the Heron UAV in February 2009. Used for the war in Afghanistan, these machines provide an intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capability for the Forces. In 2008, the Air Force announced that it would acquire its first attack helicopters (Griffons equipped with light machine guns) for service there as well. In 2006, the Navy undertook the Halifax Class Modernization/Frigate Equipment Life Extension Project (HCM/FELIX) to modernize its 12 Halifax Class Frigates. New equipment will include improved computer fire control systems, sensors and the decoy-based Rheinmettal Multi Ammunition Softkill System, a passive missile defence system.&lt;ref&gt;Brine, LCdr O.J., Modernizing the backbone of the surface fleet, The Maple Leaf, 3 June 2009, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Acquisitions pending include the [[CH-148 Cyclone]] ASW helicopter, the [[Chinook helicopter]], new Arctic patrol vessels for the navy and a new ice breaker for the [[Canadian Coast Guard]].  In July 2010, the Government of Canada announced the C$9 billion purchase of 65 [[F-35A]] fighters for delivery beginning in 2016.

In 2009, the Canadian government announced a C$880 million upgrade, including new facilities, of the signal intelligence capability of the [[Communications Security Establishment Canada]] in Ottawa, to be completed by 2015. The importance of [[electronic warfare]] on the battlefield, as demonstrated in the War in Afghanistan, was highlighted in April 2010 by the formation of 21 Electronic Warfare Regiment at CFB Kingston. The unit, the first new regiment to be formed in the Canadian Army since WWII, is being equipped with the most modern electronic warfare technology and will practice both defensive and offensive electronic warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Website (blog), Bill Robinson, ''21 EW Regiment stands up'', Lux Ex Umbra, 26 June 2010, luxexumbra.blogspot.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Polar Epsilon]] project, approved in 2005 and slated to be fully operational by 2011, uses Radarsat 2 to provide military commanders with imagery of Canada's Arctic. Another surveillance project, [[Polar Breeze]] (until recently classified secret), will use shore-based sea surface search radar, satellite-based (Radarsat 2) imagery and underwater listening devices to monitor sea surface and underwater traffic in the choke points of the Northwest Passage. The Canadian Forces have also acquired updated electronic equipment to conduct more advanced [[electronic warfare]] to face the new cybernetic threat and conduct cybernetic warfare ([[cyber-warfare]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/focus/first/defstra_e.asp Canadian Armed Forces website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Taser]] (also known as the conducted energy weapon) has been adopted for use by Canadian police forces, including the RCMP, in recent years.{{When|date=August 2010}} The technology presently deployed was developed in the US in 1999. Intended for use as a "non-lethal" weapon, the Taser fires darts trailing wires connected to a battery in the hand-held pistol. The darts strike and lodge themselves in the suspect. The battery delivers, through the wires, a jolt of electricity that incapacitates the suspect. Its use in Canada has led to considerable controversy following the deaths of four individuals who were tasered by police in separate incidents in 2007.

==End note==
In the earlier parts of Canada's history, the state often played a crucial role in the diffusion of these technologies, in some cases through a monopoly enterprise, in others with a private "partner". In more recent times, the need for the role of the state has diminished in the presence of a larger private sector.

In the latter part of the 20th century, there is evidence that Canadian values prefer public expenditures on social programmes at the expense of public spending on the maintenance and expansion of public technical infrastructure. This can be seen in the fact that in 2008 the Federation of Canadian Municipalities estimated that it would take $123 billion to restore and repair aging urban infrastructure across Canada.

'''The Frythe''' is a [[country house]] set in its own grounds in rural [[Hertfordshire]], just south of the village of [[Welwyn]], about 30 miles north of [[London]].

==History==
===Early history===
The Frythe was part of the property of [[Holywell Priory, Shoreditch]], and in 1523 William Wilshere obtained a sixty-year lease of the Frythe from the priory. As a result of the [[dissolution of the monasteries]], in 1539 the property was granted to Sir [[John Gostwick]] and Joan his wife. Within ten years, Wilshere had purchased The Frythe from Gostwick's heirs, and the property remained in the possession of the Wilshere family for several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43597 |title=''Parishes: Welwyn'', A History of the County of Hertford|volume=3 |year=1912|page=165-171|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The present "Gothic revival" mansion was built in 1846 for [[William Wilshere]] (MP for [[Great Yarmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Great Yarmouth]] from 1837 to 1846). The architects were Thomas Smith and [[Edward Blore]]. After William Wilshere's death in 1867 the house was enlarged by his brother Charles Willes Wilshere who inherited it. In 1908 on Charles Wilshere's death, it passed on to his three unmarried daughters until the last one died in 1934. The estate passed to a great-nephew, Captain Gerald Maunsell Gamul Farmer who ran the house as "The Frythe Residential and Private Hotel".&lt;ref name=knaggs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jefferyknaggs.webspace.virginmedia.com/Frythe.html|title=The Frythe, Welwyn, Hertfordshire|accessdate=6 January 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313105638/http://www.jefferyknaggs.webspace.virginmedia.com/Frythe.html|archivedate=13 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'The Frythe' was commandeered in August 1939 by the British [[Military Intelligence]].&lt;ref name="Timelapse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timelapse.dk/soe.php|title=S.O.E.|accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[World War II|Second World War]] it became a secret British [[Special Operations Executive]] factory known as [[Station IX]] making commando equipment. Secret research included military vehicles and equipment, explosives and technical sabotage, [[camouflage]], [[Biological warfare|biological]] and [[chemical warfare]]. In the grounds of The Frythe small cabins and barracks functioned as laboratories and workshops.&lt;ref name="Timelapse"/&gt;

===Research facility===
The Frythe was for many years a commercial research facility, operated by [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] from 1946, by [[Unilever]] from 1963 and by [[Smith, Kline &amp; French]] from 1977.&lt;ref name=knaggs/&gt;

====Unilever====
From 1946 to 1963 the site was shared by [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] with [[Unilever]].&lt;ref name=knaggs/&gt; New buildings were built by Unilever in the 1960s, with a contract for £400,000 in 1964 to [[Taylor Woodrow]]. Research was conducted on edible oils, margarine, ice cream, and frozen foods in the 1960s. Techniques included [[molecular biophysics]], [[X-ray crystallography]], [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] (NMR), [[mass spectrometry]], ESR spectroscopy ([[electron paramagnetic resonance]]), and [[infrared spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name=knaggs/&gt;

'''''The Occult World''''' is a book originally published in 1881 in London; it was compiled by a member of the [[Theosophical Society]] [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|A. P. Sinnett]].{{sfn|Formats and editions}} It was the first [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] work by the author; according to [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke|Goodrick-Clarke]], this book "gave sensational publicity to [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky's]] [[Paranormal|phenomena]]" and the [[Mahatma Letters|letters]] from the [[mahatma]]s, and drew the attention of the London [[Society for Psychical Research]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=12}}{{refn|group=note|[[Alvin Boyd Kuhn|Kuhn]] wrote that this book by Sinnett "was the first direct statement to the West of the existence of the [[mahatma|Masters]] and their activity as sponsors for the Theosophical Society." In his opinion, the author convincingly took over the major objective of confirming the "surpassing knowledge and sublime wisdom" of these "supermen."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=151}}}}

== History of compilation and publication ==
In September and October 1880 [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky]] and [[Henry Steel Olcott|Olcott]] visited Sinnett at [[Simla]].{{refn|group=note|P. Washington wrote that Blavatsky had been in sincere friendship with Sinnett and his wife Patience.{{sfn|Washington|1995|loc=Ch. 3}}}} Sinnett expressed serious interest in the work and teachings of the Theosophical Society, and it prompted Blavatsky help him into contact and correspondence with two [[adept]]s who sponsored the Society, the mahatmas [[Kuthumi]] and [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]].{{sfn|Theowiki}}{{refn|group=note|Goodrick-Clarke wrote that "the very concept of the Masters" is the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] idea of "invisible and secret adepts, working for the advancement of humanity."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=6}} And Tillett stated: "The concept of Masters or Mahatmas as presented by [[Helena Blavatsky|HPB]] involved a mixture of western and eastern ideas; she located most of them in India or Tibet. Both she and Colonel Olcott claimed to have seen and to be in communication with Masters. In Western [[occultism]] the idea of 'Supermen' has been found in such schools as... the fraternities established by [[Martinez de Pasqually|de Pasqually]] and [[Louis Claude de Saint-Martin|de Saint-Martin]]."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=966}}}} He was able to gather the material for his first theosophical book, which was based mostly on his notes of Blavatsky's [[occult]] work, and which "made her name widely known, though it contained nothing from her pen."{{sfn|Ryan|1975|loc=Ch. 9}}

In the second half of 1880, Anglo-Indian newspaper [[The Pioneer (newspaper)|''The Pioneer'']] published several individual and collective reports of witnesses of Blavatsky's occult phenomena, in particular on 7 November 1880 a report which was written by Sinnett himself.{{sfn|Hanson|1980|loc=Ch. V}} In 1881, he incorporated these reports into his book. In February 1881 Kuthumi, writing that he is interested in Sinnett's book and its success, gave permission to use his letters: "I lay no restrictions upon your making use of anything I may have written to you..., having full confidence in your tact and judgment as to what should be printed and how it should be presented."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 8}} In March 1881 the Sinnetts went on vacation to England, expecting to find a publisher for ''The Occult World.''{{sfn|Sinnett|1986|p=18}}{{refn|group=note|1 March 1881 Kuthumi wished Sinnett to return from Europe "with a good book" in his hand.{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 107}}}} The book was published in June 1881 during the author's stay in London. In July 1881 Sinnett returned to India, and on the next day after the arrival he received a letter in which Kuthumi congratulated him on the publication.{{sfn|Sinnett|1986|p=19}} Kuthumi wrote: "When the first hum and ding-dong of adverse criticism is hushed, thoughtful men will read and ponder over the book."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 9}}

The book is dedicated by author "to '''the Mahatma [[Koot Hoomi]]''' whose gracious friendship has given the present writer his title to claim the attention of the European world."{{sfn|Sinnett|1895}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=90}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Occult philosophy ===
The book begins with the author's allegation that there is a school of thought which modern culture has forgotten, and that the metaphysics, and to a large degree the present physical science, "have been groping for centuries blindly after knowledge which occult philosophy has enjoyed in full measure all the while." Sinnett takes the liberty to express his belief that his knowledge is certainly true.{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=152}} He argues:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I have come into some contact with persons who are heirs of a greater knowledge concerning the mysteries of Nature and humanity than modern culture has yet evolved... Modern science has accomplished grand results by the open method of investigation, and is very impatient of the theory that persons who ever attained to real knowledge, either in sciences or metaphysics, could have been content to hide their light under a bushel... But there is no need to construct hypotheses in the matter. The facts are accessible if they are sought for in the right way."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=2–4|Kuhn|1992|2p=152}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sinnett explains that "the ultimate development" of an occultist requires him to comply with "absolute physical purity." The candidate is obliged from the beginning to provide evidence that he is willing to comply with this requirement. Throughout the trial period, he should observe complete celibacy, and to refrain from all physical pleasures. However, this way of life does not presuppose any particular rigid discipline or hard asceticism, or "withdrawal from the world."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=153}} The author says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"There would be nothing to prevent a gentleman in ordinary society from being in some of the preliminary stages of training for occult candidature without anybody about him being the wiser. For true occultism, the sublime achievement of the real adept, is not attained through the loathsome asceticism of the ordinary Indian fakir, the ''[[yogi]]'' of the woods and wilds, whose dirt accumulates with his sanctity—of the fanatic who fastens iron hooks into his flesh, or holds up an arm until it is withered."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=26–27|Kuhn|1992|2pp=153–154}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Occult correspondence ===
On 29 September 1880 during an evening walk with Mrs. Sinnett, Blavatsky, responding to the suddenly expressed desire of her companion to get a little note from one of the [[Mahatma|"Brothers"]], tore off a corner of a letter received that day, and held it in her hand until it disappeared. Then Blavatsky asked her to specify where there should be a note. Mrs. Sinnett pointed to a tree, and then among its branches, she found the same corner of the paper, but now it contained a brief message written in English and signed in Tibetan symbols.{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=61–63|Kuhn|1992|2p=80}}{{sfn|Melton|2001}}{{sfn|Barborka|1973|loc=Ch. IV}}{{sfn|Olcott|2011|pp=231–232}}&lt;br/&gt;According to Barborka, this note was the first message of the mahatmas, which had come in response to an oral request, and after it Sinnett decided to write his first letter to the "Unknown Brother."{{sfn|Barborka|1973|loc=Ch. IV}}{{refn|group=note|This note is stored in the department of rare manuscripts of the [[British Library]]. Barborka wrote: "The folds of the paper and holes made when the note was pinned onto the twig are clearly visible."{{sfn|Barborka|1973|p=18}}}} The author says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"One day, therefore, I asked Madame Blavatsky whether if I wrote a letter to one of the Brothers explaining my views, she could get it delivered for me. I hardly thought this was probable, as I knew how very unapproachable the Brothers generally are; but as she said that at any rate she would try, I wrote a letter, addressing it 'to the Unknown Brother', and gave it to her to see if any result would ensue. It was a happy inspiration that induced me to do this, for out of that small beginning has arisen the most interesting correspondence in which I have ever been privileged to engage."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=92–93|Barborka|1973|2p=59}}{{refn|group=note|[[Olav Hammer|Hammer]] noted that between 1880 and 1884 Sinnett received from the mahatmas circa one hundred twenty letters.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=381}} Kuhn wrote: "Sinnett was the channel of transmission, and to him the two Masters sent a long series of letters on philosophical and other subjects, they themselves remaining in the background."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=154}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Occult phenomena ===
During Blavatsky's first visit to the Sinnetts' house at [[Allahabad]], they were able to observe, in addition to the raps, one more phenomenon. For a few days they had gone with their guest to Benares, where they had settled at a house which had been lent by the maharaja of Vizianagaram. One evening after dinner, they sat in the great hall of the house. "Suddenly three or four flowers – cut roses – fell" right between them.{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1p=51|Kuhn|1992|2p=80}}{{sfn|Melton|2001}}{{refn|group=note|[[René Guénon|Guénon]] wrote that the many theosophical phenomena can be found in a book by Sinnett ''The Occult World,'' which mentions the following things: "knocking at will, tingling of invisible bells, the carrying and 'materialization' of all sorts of objects, and above all, 'precipitation' of letters sent by 'astral' means."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=36}}}}

At Simla a picnic was planned, and a group of six men had intended to go into the forest. The supplies were designed for six men, but a seventh person suddenly joined the group. In preparation for the midday meal, the lack of a coffee cup and saucer was revealed. Someone jestingly suggested to Blavatsky to materialize the additional cup. Blavatsky held a "mental conversation" with one of her outlying "Brothers" and then pointed to a specific place, overgrown with grass and bushes. One of the participants began to dig there with a knife. After some time a white object was found, which was a tea-cup, and near it was a saucer, and as such they were no different from the other six cups and saucers brought from the Sinnetts' house. Plant roots around the utensils were found intact, and it has reportedly been proved that no one pre-dug there. When Mrs. Sinnett reached the house she counted the cups and saucers of this design and found one extra cup and saucer. However, it was impossible to buy such utensils at Simla.{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=66–68|Kuhn|1992|2pp=80–81}}{{sfn|Melton|2001}}{{sfn|Barborka|1973|p=158}}{{refn|group=note|Olcott stated about the phenomenon with a tea-cup: "To complete this part of my narrative, I will state that Mrs. Sinnett and I, reaching the house first, on the return of our party, went straight to the butler's pantry, and found the three other cups of the nine which she had left of the original dozen, put away on an upper shelf with their handles broken, and otherwise dilapidated. The seventh cup produced at the picnic had, therefore, not formed pan {{sic}} of her broken set."{{sfn|Olcott|2011|p=234}}}}{{refn|group=note|It should be noted that Sinnett's reports on Blavatsky's phenomena at Simla "were the cause of much of the misunderstanding and suffering she had to endure for the rest of her life."{{sfn|Ryan|1975|loc=Ch. 9}} Nonetheless, [[Manly Palmer Hall|Hall]] stated: "Madam Blavatsky's greatest 'miracles' are her books, and by her writings she is elevated far beyond the reach of her calumniators. Her literary accomplishments and not materialized tea-cups are the hallmark of her genius."{{sfn|Hall|1931|p=92}}}}&lt;br/&gt; This outing had one more event, when it turned out that they could not make coffee because all the water bottles were empty, and the water in the nearest stream was dirty. Their servants, sent to the brewery, were unable to get water. Then Blavatsky put the empty bottle into one of the baskets, and then pulled it out, already filled with clean water.{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=73–74|Kuhn|1992|2p=82}}{{sfn|Melton|2001}}{{refn|group=note|The major disciple of Kuthumi known as the [[Djwal Khul|"Disinherited"]] made a postscript to the letter of his Master: "The bottle filled with water I filled with my own hand—was one of the four only that the servants had in the baskets."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 8}}}}

During another outing occurred the "incident with pillow." Blavatsky turned to Sinnett with the question of where he would like to find a thing that Kuthumi is going to send. Sinnett decided to choose the most inconvenient place and pointed to one of several cushions, but at the insistence of his wife, he chose another. Once the firmly sewn pillow was ripped, they found among the feathers a note from Kuthumi and the brooch, which Mrs. Sinnett left at home.{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=109–111|Kuhn|1992|2p=83}}{{sfn|Melton|2001}}{{sfn|Barborka|1973|loc=Ch. X}}{{refn|group=note|"The skilled occultist is able to shift his consciousness from one to another plane of manifestation. In short, his control over the vibrational energies of the [[Akasha]] makes him veritably lord of all the physical creation."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=153}}}}

"While the letters [from the mahatmas] are the most valuable portion of the book," the most likely cause of its widespread popularity was the occult phenomena described by the author, which he observed personally.{{sfn|Ryan|1975|loc=Ch. 9}}{{refn|group=note|Lavoie wrote that ''The Occult World'' contains a description of the various phenomena, which were performed by Blavatsky in the presence of the author.{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=33}} [[K. Paul Johnson|Johnson]] noted that while staying in the author's home, Blavatsky "performed an astounding series of paranormal phenomena" which were reported in ''The Occult World.''{{sfn|Johnson|1995|p=21}}}}

[[René Guénon|Guénon]] wrote that Sinnett, who "at the beginning probably contributed more than anybody else to make [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophism]] known in Europe, was genuinely fooled by all of Mme Blavatsky's tricks."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=36}} In the [[Hodgson Report]] Blavatsky's phenomena described in the book by Sinnett are discussed in a section "''The Occult World'' Phenomena".{{sfn|Hodgson|1885|pp=256–273}} At the end of this section, [[Richard Hodgson (parapsychologist)|Hodgson]] claimed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I think I am justified in saying that the phenomena relied upon by Mr. Sinnett in ''The Occult World'' can be accounted for much more satisfactorily than can the performances of any ordinary professional conjurer by the uninitiated observer, however acute; that the additional details which I have been enabled to furnish in connection with some of the incidents Mr. Sinnett has recorded, clearly show that he has not been in the habit of exercising due caution for the exclusion of trickery; and that he has not proceeded in accordance with those 'scientific modes of investigation' which he explicitly declares (''Occult World,'' p. 35) he regarded as necessary for the task he attempted."{{sfn|Hodgson|1885|p=273}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Vsevolod Solovyov|Solovyov]] (with irony in relation to Sinnett) stated that from the analysis of the phenomena described in ''The Occult World'' in the Hodgson Report, "we can draw a conclusion: what a 'serious and honest' ''researcher'' we are dealing with in the case of Mr. Sinnett, this 'famous apostle' of the modern Theosophy and main defender of H. P. Blavatsky."{{sfn|Соловьёв|1893|p=158}} Nevertheless, according to Goodrick-Clarke, "a thorough analysis of the Hodgson Report by [[Vernon Harrison]] of the SPR effectively demolished... the conclusions of the Report."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=14}}{{See also|Incidents in the Life of Madame Blavatsky#Criticism}}

An American [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist]] [[Henry Kiddle]] addressed in 1883 in a London spiritualist magazine ''[[Light (spiritualist journal)|Light]]'' letter to the editor,{{sfn|Neff|2003|loc=Ch. X}} in which he said that after reading Sinnett's book ''The Occult World,'' he was "very greatly surprised,"{{sfn|Kiddle|1883}} when he discovered that one of Kuthumi's letters published in the book contains text which "was for the most part quite simply the copy of a lecture," which he made at Lake Pleasant 15 August 1880,{{sfnm|Guénon|2004|1p=40|Lavoie|2012|2p=253}} and published the same month in ''[[Banner of Light]].'' In this connection, Kiddle asked: "As Mr. Sinnett's book did not appear till a considerable time afterwards (about a year, I think), it is certain that I did not quote, consciously or unconsciously, from its pages. How, then, did it get into Kuthumi's mysterious letter?"{{sfn|Kiddle|1883}}&lt;br/&gt;
According to Guénon, "the Professor Kiddle incident" was the first strike to hit the Theosophical Society overtly. He wrote that Sinnett has presented in the fourth edition of ''The Occult World'' "a rather awkward explanation," which came from Kuthumi himself.{{refn|group=note|In December 1883 Sinnett received from the mahatma a clarification on the matter,{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 93}} and it was published in an appendix to the fourth edition of ''The Occult World''.}} Kuthumi stated that what looked like plagiarism was due to the awkwardness and carelessness of a pupil. The "Master" was forced to admit that he was negligent when he allowed his letter to be sent without checking and correction.{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=51}} He has written so:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The letter in question was framed by me while on a journey and on horseback. It was dictated mentally in the direction of and precipitated by a young ''chela'' not yet expert at this branch of psychic chemistry, and who had to transcribe it from the hardly visible imprint. Half of it, therefore, was omitted, and the other half more or less distorted by the 'artist'. When asked by him at the time whether I would look over and correct it, I answered—imprudently, I confess—'Anyhow will do, my boy; it is of no great importance if you skip a few words.' I was physically very tired by a ride of forty-eight hours consecutively, and (physically again) half asleep. Besides this, I had very important business to attend to psychically, and therefore little remained of me to devote to that letter. When I awoke I found it had already been sent on, and as I was not then anticipating its publication, I never gave it from that time a thought... Yet had I dictated my letter in the form it now appears in print, it would certainly look suspicious, and however far from what is generally called plagiarism, yet in the absence of any inverted commas it would lay a foundation for censure. But I did nothing of the kind, as the original impression now before me clearly shows."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=212–213|Lavoie|2012|2p=254}}{{refn|group=note|"When a Mr. Henry Kiddle, an American lecturer on Spiritualism, accused the writer of the Mahatma Letters of having plagiarized whole passages from his lecture delivered at Mt. Pleasant, New York, in 1880, a year prior to the publication of ''The Occult World'', the Master [[Kuthumi|K.H.]] explained in a letter to Mr. Sinnett that the apparent forgery of words and ideas came about through a bit of carelessness on his part in the precipitation of his ideas through a chela. While dictating the letter to the latter, he had caught himself 'listening in' on Mr. Kiddle's address being delivered at the moment in America; and as a consequence the chela took down portions of the actual lecture as reflected from the mind of K.H."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=157}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{More footnotes|date=July 2014}}

In [[computability theory]], a system of data-manipulation rules (such as a computer's [[instruction set]], a [[programming language]], or a [[cellular automaton]]) is said to be '''Turing complete''' or '''computationally universal''' if it can be used to simulate any [[Turing machine]]. The concept is named after English mathematician and computer scientist [[Alan Turing]]. A classic example is [[lambda calculus]].{{clarification needed|date=April 2018}}

A closely related concept is that of '''Turing equivalence'''{{snd}} two computers P and Q are called equivalent if P can simulate Q and Q can simulate P. The [[Church–Turing thesis]] conjectures that any function whose values can be computed by an [[algorithm]] can be computed by a Turing machine, and therefore that if any real-world computer can simulate a Turing machine, it is Turing equivalent to a Turing machine. A [[universal Turing machine]] can be used to simulate any Turing machine and by extension the computational aspects of any possible real-world computer.&lt;ref group=NB&gt;A UTM cannot simulate non-computational aspects such as [[Input/output|I/O]].&lt;/ref&gt;

To show that something is Turing complete, it is enough to show that it can be used to simulate some Turing complete system. For example, an [[imperative language]] is Turing complete if it has [[conditional branching]] (''e.g.'', "if" and "goto" statements, or a "branch if zero" instruction; see [[one instruction set computer]]) and the ability to change an arbitrary amount of [[computer memory|memory]] (''e.g.'', the ability to maintain an arbitrary number of data items). Of course, no physical system can have infinite memory; but if the limitation of finite memory is ignored, most programming languages are otherwise Turing complete.

==Non-mathematical usage==
In [[colloquial]] usage, the terms "Turing complete" or "Turing equivalent" are used to mean that any real-world general-purpose computer or computer language can approximately simulate the computational aspects of any other real-world general-purpose computer or computer language.

Real computers constructed so far can be functionally analyzed like a single-tape Turing machine (the "tape" corresponding to their memory); thus the associated mathematics can apply by abstracting their operation far enough.  However, real computers have limited physical resources, so they are only [[linear bounded automaton]] complete.  In contrast, a [[universal computer]] is defined as a device with a Turing complete instruction set, infinite memory, and infinite available time.

==Formal definitions==
In [[computability theory (computation)|computability theory]], several closely related terms are used to describe the computational power of a computational system (such as an [[abstract machine]] or [[programming language]]):

;Turing completeness
:A computational system that can compute every Turing-[[computable function]] is called Turing-complete (or Turing-powerful). Alternatively, such a system is one that can simulate a [[universal Turing machine]].
;Turing equivalence
:A Turing-complete system is called Turing equivalent if every function it can compute is also Turing computable; i.e., it computes precisely the same class of functions as do [[Turing machine]]s. Alternatively, a Turing-equivalent system is one that can simulate, and be simulated by, a universal Turing machine. (All known Turing-complete systems are Turing equivalent, which adds support to the [[Church–Turing thesis]].)
;(Computational) universality
:A system is called universal with respect to a class of systems if it can compute every function computable by systems in that class (or can simulate each of those systems). Typically, the term universality is tacitly used with respect to a Turing-complete class of systems. The term "weakly universal" is sometimes used to distinguish a system (e.g. a [[cellular automaton]]) whose universality is achieved only by modifying the standard definition of [[Turing machine]] so as to include input streams with infinitely many 1s.

==History==
Turing completeness is significant in that every real-world design for a computing device can be simulated by a [[universal Turing machine]]. The [[Church–Turing thesis]] states that this is a law of mathematics{{snd}} that a universal Turing machine can, in principle, perform any calculation that any other programmable [[computer]] can. This says nothing about the effort needed to write the [[computer program|program]], or the time it may take for the machine to perform the calculation, or any abilities the machine may possess that have nothing to do with computation.

[[Charles Babbage]]'s [[analytical engine]] (1830s) would have been the first Turing-complete machine if it had been built at the time it was designed. Babbage appreciated that the machine was capable of great feats of calculation, including primitive logical reasoning, but he did not appreciate that no other machine could do better. From the 1830s until the 1940s, mechanical calculating machines such as adders and multipliers were built and improved, but they could not perform a conditional branch and therefore were not Turing complete.

In the late 19th century, [[Leopold Kronecker]] formulated notions of computability, defining [[primitive recursive functions]]. These functions can be calculated by rote computation, but they are not enough to make a universal computer, because the instructions which compute them do not allow for an infinite loop. In the early 20th century, [[David Hilbert]] led a program to axiomatize all of mathematics with precise axioms and precise logical rules of deduction which could be performed by a machine. Soon, it became clear that a small set of deduction rules are enough to produce the consequences of any set of axioms. These rules were proved by [[Kurt Gödel]] in 1930 to be enough to produce every theorem.

The actual notion of computation was isolated soon after, starting with [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]. This theorem showed that axiom systems were limited when reasoning about the computation which deduces their theorems. Church and Turing independently demonstrated that Hilbert's ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' (decision problem) was unsolvable,&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Hodges | first = Andrew | authorlink = Andrew Hodges | origyear = 1983 | year = 1992 | title = [[Alan Turing: The Enigma]] |location = London | publisher=Burnett Books | page = 111 | isbn = 0-04-510060-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus identifying the computational core of the incompleteness theorem. This work, along with Gödel's work on [[general recursive functions]], established that there are sets of simple instructions, which, when put together, are able to produce any computation. The work of Gödel showed that the notion of computation is essentially unique.

In 1941 [[Konrad Zuse]] completed the [[Z3 (computer)]], the first working Turing-complete machine; this was the first digital computer in the modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3330654_How_to_make_Zuse's_Z3_a_universal_computer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computability theory==
Computability theory characterizes problems as having, or not having, computational solutions.
The first result of computability theory is that there exist problems for which it is impossible to predict what a (Turing-complete) system will do over an arbitrarily long time. 

The classic example is the [[halting problem]]: create an algorithm which takes as input (a) a program in some Turing-complete language, and (b) some data to be fed to ''that'' program; and which determines whether the program, operating on the input, will eventually stop or will continue forever. It  is trivial to create an algorithm that can do this for ''some'' inputs, but impossible to do this in general. For any characteristic of the program's eventual output, it is impossible to determine whether this characteristic will hold. 

This impossibility poses problems when analyzing real-world computer programs. For example, one cannot write a tool that entirely protects programmers from writing infinite loops, or protects users from supplying input that would cause infinite loops. 

One can instead limit a program to executing only for a fixed period of time ([[Timeout (computing)|timeout]]), or limit the power of flow control instructions (for example, providing only loops that iterate over the items of an existing array). However, another theorem shows that there are problems solvable by Turing-complete languages that cannot be solved by any language with only finite looping abilities (i.e., any language that guarantees every program will eventually finish to a halt). So any such language is not Turing complete. For example, a language in which programs are guaranteed to complete and halt cannot compute the computable function which is produced by [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] on all computable functions in that language.

==Turing oracles==
{{main article|Oracle machine}}

A computer with access to an infinite tape of data may be more powerful than a Turing machine: for instance, the tape might contain the solution to the [[halting problem]], or some other Turing-undecidable problem. Such an infinite tape of data is called a [[Turing oracle]]. Even a Turing oracle with random data is not computable ([[Almost surely|with probability 1]]), since there are only countably many computations but uncountably many oracles. So a computer with a random Turing oracle can compute things that a Turing machine cannot.

==Digital physics==
{{See also|Church–Turing thesis#Philosophical implications}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
All known laws of physics have consequences that are computable by a series of approximations on a digital computer. A hypothesis called [[digital physics]] states that this is no accident, because the [[universe]] itself is computable on a universal Turing machine. This would imply that no computer more powerful than a universal Turing machine can be built physically.

== Examples ==&lt;!-- Please respect alphabetical order --&gt;
The computational systems (algebras, calculi) that are discussed as Turing complete systems are those intended for studying [[theoretical computer science]]. They are intended to be as simple as possible, so that it would be easier to understand the limits of computation. Here are a few:
*[[Automata theory]]
*[[Formal grammar]] (language generators)
*[[Formal language]] (language recognizers)
*[[Lambda calculus]]
*[[Post–Turing machine]]s
*[[Process calculus]]
Most [[programming language]]s, conventional and unconventional, are Turing-complete. This includes:
*All general-purpose languages in wide use.

**[[Esoteric programming language]]s, a form of [[mathematical recreation]] in which programmers work out how to achieve basic programming constructs in an extremely difficult but mathematically Turing-equivalent language.

Some [[rewrite system]]s are Turing-complete.

Turing completeness is an abstract statement of ability, rather than a prescription of specific language features used to implement that ability. The features used to achieve Turing completeness can be quite different; [[Fortran]] systems would use loop constructs or possibly even [[goto]] statements to achieve repetition; Haskell and Prolog, lacking looping almost entirely, would use [[recursion]]. Most programming languages are describing computations on von Neumann architectures, which have memory (RAM and register) and a control unit. These two elements make this architecture Turing-complete. Even pure [[functional language]]s are Turing-complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |last1=Boyer |first1=Robert S. |last2=Moore |first2=J. Strother |title=A Mechanical Proof of the Turing Completeness of Pure Lisp |number=37 |institution=Institute for Computing Science, University of Texas at Austin |date=May 1983 |url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/boyer/ftp/ics-reports/cmp37.pdf |format=PDF |dead-url=no |archive-date=22 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922044624/http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/boyer/ftp/ics-reports/cmp37.pdf |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=NB&gt;The following book provides an introduction for computation models: {{cite book |first1=Thomas |last1=Rauber |first2=Gudula |last2=Rünger |title=Parallel programming: for multicore and cluster systems |date=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UbpAAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing completeness in declarative [[SQL]] is implemented through [[Hierarchical_and_recursive_queries_in_SQL|recursive common table expressions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dfetter |author2=Breinbaas |url=https://wiki.postgresql.org/index.php?title=Cyclic_Tag_System&amp;oldid=15106 |title=Cyclic Tag System |website=PostgreSQL wiki |date=8 August 2011 |accessdate=2014-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unsurprisingly, procedural extensions to SQL ([[PLSQL]], etc.) are also Turing complete. This illustrates one reason why relatively powerful non-Turing-complete languages are rare: the more powerful the language is initially, the more complex are the tasks to which it is applied and the sooner its lack of completeness becomes perceived as a drawback, encouraging its extension until it is Turing complete.

The untyped [[lambda calculus]] is Turing-complete, but many typed lambda calculi, including [[System F]], are not. The value of typed systems is based in their ability to represent most typical computer programs while detecting more errors.

[[Rule 110]] and [[Conway's Game of Life]], both [[cellular automaton|cellular automata]], are Turing complete.

&lt;!-- You might have seen the article on BoingBoing that says PowerPoint is Turing-complete. Maybe it is, but the BoingBoing article cites a YouTube presentation that was part of SIGBOVIK. SIGBOVIK is a *PARODY* conference. If something is presented in SIGBOVIK, that does not mean it's true, and might in fact mean that it's *NOT* true. If you want the article to say that Microsoft PowerPoint is Turing-complete, get a better source than something which ultimately points back to SIGBOVIK. --&gt;

== Non-Turing-complete languages ==
Many computational languages exist that are not Turing complete.  One such example is the set of [[regular language]]s, which are generated by [[regular expression]]s and which are recognized by [[finite state machine|finite automata]]. A more powerful but still not Turing-complete extension of finite automata is the category of [[pushdown automaton|pushdown automata]] and [[context-free grammar]]s, which are commonly used to generate parse trees in an initial stage of program [[compiler|compiling]].  Further examples include some of the early versions of the pixel shader languages embedded in [[Direct3D]] and [[OpenGL]] extensions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In [[total functional programming]] languages, such as [[Charity (programming language)|Charity]] and [[Epigram (programming language)|Epigram]], all functions are total and must terminate. Charity uses a type system and [[control flow|control constructs]] based on [[category theory]], whereas Epigram uses [[dependent type]]s. The [[LOOP (programming language)|LOOP]] language is designed so that it computes only the functions that are [[primitive recursive function|primitive recursive]]. All of these compute proper subsets of the total computable functions, since the full set of total computable functions is not [[recursively enumerable set|computably enumerable]]. Also, since all functions in these languages are total, algorithms for [[recursively enumerable set]]s cannot be written in these languages, in contrast with Turing machines.

Although (untyped) [[lambda calculus]] is Turing-complete, [[simply typed lambda calculus]] is not.

===Data languages===
The notion of Turing-completeness does not apply to languages such as [[XML]], [[HTML]], [[JSON]], [[YAML]] and [[S-expression]]s, because they are typically used to represent structured data, not describe computation. These are sometimes referred to as [[markup language]]s, or more properly as "container languages" or "data description languages".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} However, [[Rule 110]], a Turing-complete cellular automaton, has been successfully implemented in [[CSS 3]], thus proving, to some extent, its Turing completeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Is CSS Turing complete? |website=Stack Overflow |url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2497146/is-css-turing-complete }}&lt;/ref&gt;
