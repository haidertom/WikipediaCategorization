An '''''aka-e''''' ({{lang|ja|赤絵}} "red picture") is a type of [[ukiyo-e]] that is printed entirely or predominantly in red.  Aka-e were said to be talismans against [[smallpox]], especially when they bore images of [[Zhong Kui|Shōki the demon queller]].  A woodblock print having a significant portion of the design entirely in red may also be considered to be an aka-e.

'''''Allegiance''''' is a musical with music and lyrics by Jay Kuo and a book by [[Marc Acito]], Kuo and Lorenzo Thione. The story, set during the [[Japanese American internment]] of [[World War II]] (with a [[framing story]] set in the present day), was inspired by the personal experiences of [[George Takei]], who stars in the musical. It follows the Kimura family in the years following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], as they are forced to leave their farm in [[Salinas, California]] and are sent to the [[Heart Mountain Relocation Center|Heart Mountain internment camp]] in the rural plains of [[Wyoming]].

The musical began development in 2008 and premiered in September 2012 in [[San Diego]], California. It played on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] from October 2015 to February 2016.&lt;ref name=Closing1/&gt; Reviews on Broadway were mixed, although the cast was generally praised.&lt;ref name=BWWRoundup/&gt;

==Conception and historical perspective==
In the fall of 2008, [[George Takei]] and his husband, Brad, were coincidentally seated next to Jay Kuo and Lorenzo Thione at an [[Off-Broadway]] show, where a brief conversation revealed a mutual love of theater.  The next day, the four were once again seated together at a Broadway show, ''[[In the Heights]]''.  At intermission, Kuo and Thione approached Takei, curious as to why he had been so emotionally affected by the father's song ("Useless") in which he laments his inability to help his family. Over the course of that intermission, Takei recounted his personal experience as a child in a [[Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese internment camp]], during World War II, and his own father's sense of helplessness at his inability to protect his family that was mirrored in the song. Kuo and Thione felt that Takei's family's experience would make a great show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2010/jul/18/allegiance-pledges-to-make-it-to-broadway/ "''Allegiance'' pledges to make it to Broadway"], UTSanDiego.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allegiancemusical.com/post/creators Creators] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915083812/http://www.allegiancemusical.com/post/creators |date=2012-09-15 }}, Allegiancemusical.com, July 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Although previous major Broadway musicals have involved Asian and Asian-American topics or settings, including three of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s shows, ''[[Pacific Overtures]]'' and ''[[Miss Saigon]]'', ''Allegiance'' is "the first [Broadway] musical created by Asian Americans, directed by an Asian American ... with a predominantly Asian cast ... [and] an Asian-American viewpoint informing the work".&lt;ref&gt;Tran, Diep. [http://www.americantheatre.org/2015/10/27/from-orientalism-to-authenticity-broadways-yellow-fever/ "From Orientalism to Authenticity: Broadway’s Yellow Fever"], ''[[Theatre Communications Group|American Theatre]]'' magazine, October 27, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of the musical takes some liberties with history. According to Frank Abe, the creator of the documentary film ''Conscience and the Constitution'', the musical "conflate[s] [[Heart Mountain Relocation Center|Heart Mountain]] with the worst of the [[Tule Lake Unit, World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument#Tule Lake Segregation Center|segregation center at Tule Lake]] and invent[s] military rule at Heart Mountain."&lt;ref name=Nichi&gt;Abe, Frank. [http://www.nichibei.org/2015/11/allegiance-uplifts-by-doctoring-japanese-american-history/ "''Allegiance'' uplifts by doctoring Japanese American history"], ''Nichi Bei Weekly'', November 5, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  The processing of new arrivals is embellished for dramatic effect, as handcuffs and physical abuse by military police was not reported in the internment camps. Abe comments that the resistance by the [[Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee]] was a studied act of civil disobedience, not a gang of "fists-raised revolutionaries". He notes: "No firearms were used inside the [camps'] perimeter. The resistance was open and above-board, its meetings open to the public. No one had to run or hide; leaders of the Fair Play Committee were quietly taken into custody at their family barracks. ... The resisters knew they risked five years in prison for bucking the draft, but violating the Selective Service Act was never a capital crime, never treason. No resistance leader at Heart Mountain was beaten bloody or hunted by guards", draft cards were not burned, and no newspaper articles affected the internment; notably Frankie would not have been taken to the infirmary by military police, which causes the key conflict in the show.&lt;ref name=Nichi/&gt; Abe objects to the portrayal of the activities and treatment of the resisters, and to the "relentless optimism" of the score, concluding that the show distorts the historical lesson, diminishes the real impact of "the anger and suppressed rage" that the internees carried from the internment camps, and "risks supplanting the truth of the resistance and the Japanese American experience in the popular mind [and] cheapens the fabric of basic reality to achieve [commercial] ends."&lt;ref name=Nichi/&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
An aged World War II veteran, Sam Kimura, prepares for a [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] anniversary ceremony. A woman arrives to inform him that his estranged sister Kei has died, and that she is Kei's executor. She gives Sam an envelope and tells him that the funeral is to be held later that afternoon. Angered by the opening of his old family wounds after nearly 60 years of estrangement, he berates his once-beloved sister for not leaving him in peace. Kei's ghost informs Sam that she couldn't rest in peace without making one last attempt to reconnect with him.

It is 1941, and Sammy is a newly elected class president who dreams of "Going Places", like college and high political office. His widower father Tatsuo, and grandfather Ojii-chan, own a farm in [[Salinas, California|Salinas]], California. Sammy adores his older sister Kei, who has postponed her own dreams to help raise him. Tatsuo is always pushing Sammy to be better and reach his potential. Sammy believes that Tatsuo blames Sammy for his wife's death in childbirth. After the Japanese sneak [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December, the US government fears that Japanese-Americans might be loyal to the [[Empire of Japan]]. The Japanese-Americans in the Western US are [[Internment of Japanese Americans|incarcerated in internment camps]]. Sammy's family is forced to sell their beautiful farm for a small price and sent to the bleak [[Heart Mountain Relocation Center]] in Wyoming.
 	
While in this camp, and against his father's wishes, Sammy joins with [[Mike Masaoka]], head of the [[Japanese American Citizens League]], which cooperates with the authorities to identify "disloyal" Japanese. When his grandfather, Ojii-chan, becomes sick, Sammy goes to see the white Quaker volunteer nurse at the camp, Hannah, for some cough syrup.  She tells him it is only for the staff, but Sammy is persuasive, and she gives him the medication. The two begin a relationship that causes additional tensions, because [[Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States|interracial marriage]] with Hannah would be illegal. Tatsuo is not inclined to cooperate. He is sent to a brutal prison for refusing to swear his allegiance by answering "yes" on an [[Internment of Japanese Americans#Loyalty questions and segregation|unjustly-worded loyalty questionnaire]]. Sammy's sister Kei falls in love with a [[Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee|draft resistance leader]], Frankie Suzuki, and she also joins the resisters advocating for the rights of her people.

===Act II===
Masaoka manages to obtain Washington's permission for the Japanese-Americans to enlist in US armed forces, but only if they take on the most dangerous assignments in the war in Italy. Eager to prove his loyalty, Sammy enlists in the [[442nd Regimental Combat Team]], a US Army unit consisting of American-born sons of Japanese immigrants, and he fights bravely in Europe. He leads fellow [[Nisei]] on a [[Lost_Battalion_(Europe,_World_War_II)|suicide mission]], in which the majority of the soldiers are killed. While in prison, Tatsuo is given a copy of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine that trumpets Sammy's bravery in combat, and is told that he was only let out of his cell because of his son's actions.

Meanwhile, Kei and Frankie, who are still in love, help lead the resistance. Eventually, Frankie's scuffles with a military policeman lead to Hannah's accidental and fatal shooting. Grandpa Ojii-chan, who has managed to grow a crop of vegetables in the mountain's rough terrain, dies peacefully while in his garden. After the war, Sammy learns that Frankie and Kei, now married, have a daughter named Hanako (after nurse Hannah). Aghast at this, he confronts Tatsuo, saying that Frankie was the son he always wanted. Already furious at Kei and Frankie, he learns of Hannah's death at Heart Mountain and blames Kei and Frankie. He then walks away from his family for a job in Washington that Masaoka had offered him after discharge. Kei argues with Sammy, calling him a coward for leaving his family. She tries to stop him, but only manages to tear the [[Purple Heart]] off of his uniform.

Back in the present day, Sam opens the envelope and finds a posthumous bequest from Kei: the ''Life'' magazine featuring Sammy's exploits that Tatsuo had kept since his release from prison. Sam attends Kei's funeral, and Kei's executor thanks him for attending. The executor then says that her mother wanted to give Sam something else, and she hands him his old Purple Heart medal.  He then realizes that the executor is his niece Hanako. He breaks down, aware that he has a chance to forgive and to share in the love and compassion of his family.

''Allegiance'' had its first reading at the [[Japanese American National Museum]] on July 13, 2009 starring George Takei, [[Lea Salonga]] and others. It was followed by two more readings that were held in New York in 2010 with the same two, but this time with [[Telly Leung]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth.

==Reception==

===Critical reaction===
For the Old Globe production in 2012, critics felt the subject was important but the show required better execution. Writing for the ''Los Angeles Times'', Anne Marie Welsh concluded the "show needs a sharper emotional focus and musical edge to match its bold subject".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/sep/20/entertainment/la-et-cm-old-globe-review-20120921 |title=Theater review: 'Allegiance' gives Japanese internment a soft focus |author=Welsh, Anne Marie |date=20 September 2012 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the ''San Diego Reader'', critic Jeff Smith wrote "Right now, ''Allegiance'' is, at best, an 'important' musical. But it needs a great deal of rethinking and reshaping to become a good one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2012/sep/26/theater-allegiance-important-musical-old-globe/ |title=''Allegiance'', an important musical at the Old Globe |author=Smith, Jeff |date=26 September 2012 |newspaper=San Diego Reader |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical reception for the Broadway production was mixed. While the cast was often praised, especially Takei's characterization and Salonga's singing, the reviews frequently criticized poor execution of a worthy subject, especially the lyrics.&lt;ref name=BWWRoundup&gt;[http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Review-Roundup-George-Takei-Lea-Salonga-Telly-Leung-on-Broadway-in-ALLEGIANCE-20151109 "Review Roundup: George Takei, Lea Salonga, Telly Leung on Broadway in ''Allegiance''"], BroadwayWorld.com, November 9, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYRoundup&gt;Sheward, David. [http://www.newyork.com/articles/broadway/review-roundup-allegiance-48955/ "Review Roundup: ''Allegiance''"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125031051/http://www.newyork.com/articles/broadway/review-roundup-allegiance-48955/ |date=2015-11-25 }}, NewYork.com, November 10, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; "The majority of critics admired ''Allegiance's'' noble intentions to illuminate a dark corner of America’s past, but found the book melodramatic and the score derivative."&lt;ref name=NYRoundup/&gt; Alexis Soloski of ''[[The Guardian]]'' called the musical "unexceptional though often affecting" and gave it three stars out of five. He liked some of the 1940s style songs but said of the ballads that "none of the melodies linger once the curtain has fallen and the lyrics pile on platitude and cliché."&lt;ref&gt;Soloski, Alexis.

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s review singled out Takei's performance as "providing much-needed islands of levity amidst a sea of sadness. ... Allegiance is an important show with a phenomenal cast, and it deserves to be seen."&lt;ref&gt;Biedenharn, Isabella. [http://www.ew.com/article/2015/11/07/allegiance-ew-stage-review "Allegiance: EW stage review"], ''Entertainment Weekly'', November 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rex Reed]], in ''[[The New York Observer]]'' praised the book, score and direction, writing: "The [finale] brought tears to my eyes. The audience is overwhelmed. The screams are voluminous. The songs carry you aloft on wings of triumph, and the greatest cast of under-used Asian talents since ''[[Flower Drum Song]]'' and ''[[Pacific Overtures]]'' brings a cheering crowd to its feet every night with a standing ovation that is well deserved.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Rex.

The show has fully developed characters, a strong cast and a new story to tell in an old-fashioned way."&lt;ref&gt;Winer, Linda. [http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/theater/allegiance-review-george-takei-on-wwii-japanese-american-camps-1.11069303 "''Allegiance'' review: George Takei on WWII Japanese-American camps"], ''[[Newsday]]'', November 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'', having reviewed the original production at the Old Globe in 2012, was more positive, feeling that the new production, "retains both its powerful story core and a good deal of its lush and melodic score, along with nearly all the top cast members from the original version. ... At its best, “Allegiance” gracefully shapes dramatic and historical contours into an epic that – in the spirit of ''gaman'' – coaxes a fierce beauty from once-poisoned soil."&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, James.

[but] if you can make a critic who sneered in the first act leave the theater a little teary-eyed, you're probably doing something right."&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Elysa. [https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/theater/2015/11/08/george-takei-allegiance-broadway-musical-star-trek/75266498/ "George Takei makes the trek to Broadway in ''Allegiance''"], ''USA Today'', November 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Deadline (magazine)|Deadline]]'' magazine called ''Allegiance'' "another significant addition to a Broadway season that offers an alternative take on the American experience. ... Validation is hardly the worst crime a show can commit, and I think that’s one reason the audience was cheering at the very moving end of the show. It’s a triumph of a rare sort, shedding light in a dark corner of our history with uncommon generosity of spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Gerard, Jeremy.

In ''[[The New York Times]]'', however, [[Charles Isherwood]] praised the performers but wrote: "The show wants to illuminate a dark passage in American history with complexity and honesty, but the first requirement of any Broadway musical is to entertain. While well-intentioned and polished, ''Allegiance'' struggles to balance both ambitions, and doesn’t always find an equilibrium."&lt;ref&gt;Isherwood, Charles.

[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/george-takei-lea-salonga-allegiance-838242 "''Allegiance'': Theater Review"], ''The Hollywood Reporter'', November 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Dale of BroadwayWorld.com admired the cast, but thought that "Allegiance, while certainly not a bad theatre piece, is an underachieving one."&lt;ref&gt;Dale, Michael.

'''BookSwim''' is a [[Privately held company|private]] [[United States|American]] online [[book rental]] service, offering rental-by-mail of both [[book|hardcover]] and [[paperback books]].  The company was launched in 2007 and has grown steadily since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.entrepreneur.com/magazine/entrepreneursstartupsmagazine/2008/may/193398.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
George Burke co-founded BookSwim with friend [[Shamoon Siddiqui]] in April 2007, in Shamoon's basement for the first ten months of the company’s existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/today/s_510381.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114024721/http://pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/today/s_510381.html# |archive-date=2007-11-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has since branched out, briefly moving to [[Aberdeen, NJ]] before establishing headquarters in [[Newark, NJ]] with distribution facilities in eastern [[Pennsylvania]].

=== Rental Service ===
BookSwim provides unlimited rental-by-mail of [[hardcover]] and [[paperback book]]s on a monthly subscription basis. Subscribers add books to their online reading list, called a Rental Pool. When the subscriber returns finished books, the next books in the Rental Pool ship out. The similarity to [[Netflix]]'s business model has led to the website informally being called the 'Netflix for books.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.cnet.com/8301-13512_3-10223739-23.html&lt;/ref&gt;' BookSwim's plans begin at $9.99 per month and include only hardcover and paperback books.

=== Honors &amp; Appearances ===
BookSwim entered and won [[Rutgers University]]’s Business Plan Competition in 2008 and an accompanying cash prize of $20,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.jsp?articleId=281474977367490&amp;nav=Namespace{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was named a 'Startup to Watch' by [[Entrepreneur Magazine]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.entrepreneur.com/magazine/entrepreneursstartupsmagazine/2008/may/193398.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the New Jersey Technology Council.

=== Market Conditions &amp; Competitiveness ===
BookSwim's subscribers tend to be high-income avid readers who read over forty books a year; roughly 80% of them are female.&lt;ref&gt;http://publishingperspectives.com/2010/07/bookswim-com-aims-for-sweet-spot-of-american-readers/&lt;/ref&gt; As "the core of [the] business is in bestsellers,&lt;ref&gt;http://publishingperspectives.com/2010/07/bookswim-com-aims-for-sweet-spot-of-american-readers/&lt;/ref&gt;" BookSwim cites its rental of hardcovers as its main competitive edge over competitor [[Booksfree]].&lt;ref&gt;http://jscms.jrn.columbia.edu/cns/2008-05-13/bindley-bookrentals&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relationships with Libraries ====
Though [[libraries]]’ reactions to BookSwim have included anxiety&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tametheweb.com/2007/01/libraries_netflix_bookswim.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231034620/http://tametheweb.com/2007/01/libraries_netflix_bookswim.html |archivedate=2010-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and resentment,&lt;ref&gt;http://marketinginlibraries.wordpress.com/2008/08/10/we-have-met-the-enemy-and-he-isbookswim/&lt;/ref&gt; BookSwim does not see itself as competition with libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/today/s_510381.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114024721/http://pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/today/s_510381.html# |archive-date=2007-11-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has expressed interest in taking libraries on as customers&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6456823.html&lt;/ref&gt; and its co-founders appeared at the 2008 Colorado Interlibrary Loan Conference to speak about potential partnerships with them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aclin.org/coloillconf/2008ILLSchedule.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, BookSwim donated an extra 13,000 books from its inventory to the [[Newark Public Library]] near its new offices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/newark/index.ssf/2008/10/online_bookstore_donates_title.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Irving Thornton''' (January 20, 1841 – March 12, 1842) was an [[United States|American]] [[infant]] from the state of Virginia.  His tombstone, located in [[Cumberland State Forest]] in [[Cumberland County, Virginia|Cumberland County]], [[Virginia]], is listed on the [[Virginia Landmarks Register]] and the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as one of only two gravestones in the world, and the only one in the [[United States]], known to exist with an [[epitaph]] by [[Charles Dickens]].&lt;!-- Does anyone know who the other is? --&gt;

==History==
Charles Irving Thornton was the son of Anthony and M. I. Thornton of Cumberland County.  He died on March 12, 1842, at the age of 13 months and 19 days.  A Dr. Deane was attending to the child, and upon his death was moved to write to Dickens to request an epitaph to be placed on the child's grave.  Dickens had recently visited [[Virginia]] as part of his tour of the United States, but by mid-March had moved on to [[Ohio]].  The author's reasons for complying with the doctor's request remain unclear, especially given the extreme distaste that he expressed toward Virginia's continued economic dependence on [[slavery]]; to explain his possible motivations, some historians have attempted to establish a genealogical link between Dickens, the Thorntons, and [[Washington Irving]].

Thornton's grave may still be visited today; it is in a difficult-to-find area of the state forest, but park rangers are willing to direct people to the site.

==Epitaph==
The epitaph was edited slightly from the one provided by Dickens.  It reads:

{| style="text-align:center"

of&lt;br /&gt;
a Little Child&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46540">'''Copyright Alert System''' ('''CAS''') was a voluntary industry effort to educate and penalize internet users who engage in the unauthorized and unlawful distribution of [[copyright]]ed works via [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] services. The program was operated by the [[Center for Copyright Information]], a consortium consisting of the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), and the [[internet service provider]]s [[AT&amp;T]], [[Cablevision]], [[Comcast]], [[Time Warner Cable]], and [[Verizon]].&lt;ref name=farivar&gt;{{cite news

The CAS used a [[graduated response]] system (also known as the '''"six strikes program"'''), in which participating ISPs would send warnings notifying subscribers of alleged copyright infringement, as reported by a monitoring service working on behalf of participating copyright owners.&lt;ref name="cci_press_release"&gt;Brimmeier, Khristyn.

After a fifth warning, ISPs were allowed to implement "mitigation measures", which could include penalties such as [[bandwidth throttling]] or preventing web access until customers "discuss the matter" with their ISP.&lt;ref name="agreementars"&gt;{{cite web | last = Anderson | first = Nate | title = Major ISPs agree to "six strikes" copyright enforcement plan | publisher = Ars Technica | date = July 7, 2011 | url = https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/07/major-isps-agree-to-six-strikes-copyright-enforcement-plan/ | accessdate = 2013-02-26 }}

The CAS framework was established on July 7, 2011 after three years in the making.&lt;ref name="cci_press_release" /&gt; After multiple delays, ISPs began implementing it in late February 2013.&lt;ref name="implementationrollout"&gt;{{cite web | last = Farivar | first = Cyrus | title = "Six strikes" enforcement policy debuts | publisher = Ars Technica | date = Feb 25, 2013 | url = https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/02/six-strikes-enforcement-policy-debuts/ | accessdate = 2013-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lesser|first=Jill|title=Copyright Alert System Set to Begin|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/uncategorized/copyright-alert-system-set-to-begin/|work=Center For Copyright Information|publisher=Center For Copyright Information|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAS discontinued the program on January 30, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RIP, "Six Strikes" Copyright Alert System|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/01/rip-six-strikes-copyright-alert-system/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Center for Copyright Information employed the services of [[MarkMonitor]] (often doing business as DtecNet) to detect and monitor suspected copyright infringement activity.&lt;ref name=EFF201211&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/11/us-copyright-surveillance-machine-about-be-switched-on |title=U.S. Copyright Surveillance Machine About To Be Switched On, Promises of Transparency Already Broken |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |date=15 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although MarkMonitor monitored many infringement venues, in early 2013 the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) said it appeared that for purposes of the CAS, the company will only monitor peer-to-peer traffic from public [[BitTorrent tracker]]s.&lt;ref name=EFF_FAQ&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/02/six-strikes-copyright-alert-system-faq&lt;/ref&gt; The Copyright Alert System does not use [[deep packet inspection]].&lt;ref name=mueller-kuehn-santoso/&gt;{{rp|361}}

A review of MarkMonitor's system for the CAS stated that only uploads were monitored, with infringement being suspected when MarkMonitor's BitTorrent client successfully obtains pieces of known-infringing content from a peer in the swarm. The pieces were compared to pieces from an already-downloaded copy of the content, which had already been matched to content samples supplied by the copyright owners.&lt;ref name=Stroz/&gt;

When suspected infringement was detected, the ISP for the [[IP address]] associated with the suspicious activity was notified. The ISP, in turn, notified the subscriber to whom the IP address was assigned at the time of the alleged infringement, informing the subscriber that their account was suspected of being used to infringe copyright, and warning of potential consequences. Users who continue to receive warnings could be issued up to six alerts in the form of pop-up messages and e-mails before stronger measures were taken by the ISP.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Intent==
The Copyright Alert System was intended to be {{cquote|a consumer-focused process for identifying and notifying residential wired Internet access service customers of the participating ISPs (other than dial-up subscribers) who receive multiple notifications of allegations of online infringement made via P2P networks and applications, in an effort to educate consumers, deter online infringement, and direct consumers to lawful online legitimate sources of content online.&lt;ref name=MOU/&gt;}}

The Center for Copyright Information believed that the Copyright Alert System would be effective in reducing both intentional and unintentional copyright infringement. By providing willing infringers with information regarding the serious consequences of copyright infringement, the CCI hoped to steer would-be infringers to legal online content providers. The CCI hoped that unwitting infringers, such as those whose home networks have been hijacked by unauthorized users or the parents of children who are infringing, would use the knowledge that their account is being used for copyright infringement to force users of the account to curtail these activities. The CCI also hoped to increase parents' involvement in what their children are doing online by alerting misconduct and abuse of their accounts.&lt;ref name="FlintLATimes"&gt;Joe Flint, [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/07/entertainment-giants-and-broadband-providers-team-up-on-piracy-effort.html "Entertainment giants and broadband providers team up on piracy effort"], Los Angeles Times, July 6, 2011. Retrieved November 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EFF claimed the materials used to "educate consumers" were "more like propaganda", and that the framework violated the principle of [[presumption of innocence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/11/us-copyright-surveillance-machine-about-be-switched-on|date=November 15, 2012|title=U.S. Copyright Surveillance Machine About To Be Switched On, Promises of Transparency Already Broken|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alerts==
The system of alerts was as follows:

* The first and second alerts notified ISP subscribers that their Internet account has allegedly been used for copyright infringement, provided an explanation of how to avoid future offenses, and directed users to lawful content sites.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;
* If the suspicious behavior persisted, additional alerts were sent. These alerts ask the subscriber to acknowledge receipt of the messages by clicking a notice.
* After a fifth alert, ISPs were allowed to take "mitigation measures" to prevent future infringement.
* If the ISP did not institute a mitigation measure following the fifth alert, it had to enact one after the sixth alert.

Mitigation measures included: "temporary reductions of Internet speeds, redirection to a landing page until the subscriber contacts the ISP to discuss the matter or reviews and responds to some educational information about copyright, or other measures (as specified in published policies) that the ISP may deem necessary to help resolve the matter".&lt;ref name="FAQs"&gt;[http://www.copyrightinformation.org/faq Center for Copyright Information FAQs] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/66gWCLxtq?url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/faq |date=2012-04-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mitigation measures varied by company. [[Verizon]] was the first to reveal their mitigation policy. Their policy specified that violators with more than three alerts would be directed to an online copyright law information. Upon a fifth or sixth alert, the user would experience a temporary speed reduction down to 256kbit/s (approximately the speed of dial-up internet access).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Kevin|title=LEAKED: Verizon's New Anti-Piracy Measure Will Give Offenders 6 Chances|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/verizon-anti-piracy-gives-6-chances-2013-1|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a leaked internal document, [[AT&amp;T]] decided that after a 6th alert, a user's "access to many of the most frequently visited websites [would be] restricted" until they completed an "online educational tutorial on copyright".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone|first=Jeff|title=AT&amp;T Could Block Facebook, The Pirate Bay And Others When 'Six Strike' Program Begins Next Month|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/att-could-block-facebook-pirate-bay-others-when-six-strike-program-begins-next-month-845709|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[AT&amp;T]] later explained that it would not cut the user off the internet even though such measure appeared in the copyright warning letter. It gave a reason that the six strikes warnings are only allegations; therefore, if the alleged user was still suspected of illegal downloading after completion of the "online educational tutorial on copyright" and the six strikes warnings, unless the copyright owner took legal action; nothing would happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bort|first=Julie|title=AT&amp;T Promises (Again) Not To Disconnect Your Account If It Suspects You Of Illegal Downloading|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/att-wont-disconnect-over-six-strikes-2013-9|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time Warner Cable]] stated that it would not discontinue customers' service, but instead redirect users to educational pages on copyright law upon multiple violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCullagh|first=Declan|title=Cable companies say they won't disconnect accused pirates|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57550782-38/cable-companies-say-they-wont-disconnect-accused-pirates/|publisher=CNET|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CCI said that at no point in the process would the ISPs reveal customer information to the CCI, the monitoring service, or the copyright owners.&lt;ref name=cas-faqs&gt;{{cite web|title=Copyright Alert System FAQs|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/resources-faq/copyright-alert-system-faqs/|work=The Copyright Alert System|publisher=Center for Copyright Information|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EFF said that because the system "will not identify those who take steps to anonymize their Internet traffic using a VPN or Tor" it would not stop dedicated infringers.&lt;ref name=EFF_FAQ/&gt;

The EFF also argued that the mitigation measures to be undertaken by ISPs in response to alleged copyright infringement were overly harsh, as they could be used to deny consumers access to the Internet, which EFF maintained is as fundamental a right in the digital era as access to other utilities such as electricity.&lt;ref name="EFFReaction" /&gt; Annemarie Bridy wrote that although temporary suspension was a possible mitigation measure, market pressure would discourage ISPs from using it, instead relying on more educational measures.&lt;ref name=bridy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bridy|first=Annemarie|title=Graduated Response American Style: "Six Strikes" Measured Against Five Norms|journal=Fordham Intellectual Property, Media &amp; Entertainment Law Journal|year=2012|volume=23|pages=1–66|ssrn=2145059|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39–40}} Mueller, Kuehn, and Santoso attributed the ISPs' adoption of the Copyright Alert System to its voluntary nature and the fact the ISPs were not required to terminate accounts under the Copyright Alert System.&lt;ref name=mueller-kuehn-santoso /&gt;{{rp|361}}

==Appeal process==
The CAS process did not allow alerts to be challenged until a mitigation measure was about to be imposed.&lt;ref name=alert-wrongly-sent&gt;{{cite web|title=What Do I Do if I Think the Alert Was Wrongly Sent|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/the-copyright-alert-system/what-do-i-do-if-i-think-the-alert-was-wrongly-sent/|work=The Copyright Alert System|publisher=Center for Copyright Information|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the subscriber could request, through a special link provided by their ISP, a special [[arbitration]] proceeding.&lt;ref name=alert-wrongly-sent/&gt; The proceeding would be administered by the [[American Arbitration Association]] (AAA),&lt;ref name=alert-wrongly-sent/&gt; and the arbitrator would be selected by the AAA.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|33}} The process was "automated to the maximum extent practicable",&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|33}} with the intent of resolving the dispute within thirty days of filing.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|37}}

The appeal had to be requested within 14 days of the alert triggering the mitigation measure.&lt;ref name=alert-wrongly-sent/&gt; The subscriber had to pay a $35 filing fee, unless the fee was waived by the AAA.&lt;ref name=alert-wrongly-sent/&gt; According to CCI Executive Director Jill Lesser, the $35 fee "defray[ed] a small part of the cost of the appeal and [was] intended to discourage frivolous appeals".&lt;ref name=congressional-internet-caucus&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Congressional Internet Caucus Meets on Copyright and Piracy|url=http://www.c-span.org/Events/Congressional-Internet-Caucus-Meets-on-Copyright-and-Piracy/10737438657-1/ |accessdate=2013-05-12 |time=19:52 |publisher=C-SPAN| date=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prevail, the subscriber had to successfully challenge a specified number of alerts (possibly more than one) to block the mitigation measure and receive a refund of the filing fee.&lt;ref name=alert-wrongly-sent/&gt;

Subscribers could only challenge alerts on one or more of the following pre-defined grounds:&lt;ref name=alert-wrongly-sent/&gt;&lt;ref name="review-grounds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/resources-faq/independent-review-faqs/what-are-the-grounds-for-requesting-a-review/ |title=What are the Grounds for Requesting a Review? |publisher=Center for Copyright Information |accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Misidentification of Account – The subscriber's account was incorrectly identified as a source of copyright infringement.
* Unauthorized Use of Account – The alleged infringement was the result of unauthorized, unpreventable use of the subscriber's account by others, without the subscriber's knowledge.
* Authorization – The subscriber's use of the work identified in the alert was specifically authorized in writing by the work's copyright owner or someone with a license to reproduce the work.&lt;ref name=bridy /&gt;{{rp|36}}
* Fair Use – The subscriber's use of the work identified in the alert meets the U.S. legal definition of [[fair use]].
* Misidentification of File – The file "did not consist primarily of the alleged copyrighted work at issue but rather contained other non-infringing material".
* Work Published Before 1923 – The work identified in the alert was published prior to 1923 and therefore is in the [[public domain]] in the United States.

In an appeal, the burden of proof was on the subscriber to demonstrate the elements of one of the above grounds for challenging an alert.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|34}}

The choice of defenses allowed in an appeal was criticized. The defense of unauthorized use of account was not allowed if the user was a member of the subscriber's household or an invitee, and after the first assertion of this defense, the subscriber had to demonstrate by "clear and convincing evidence" that the subscriber "took reasonable steps to secure the account following the first occurrence of unauthorized use".&lt;ref name=bridy /&gt;{{rp|35}} Bridy wrote that this creates an obligation for subscribers to secure their Internet connection even when they had no legal or contractual obligation to do so.&lt;ref name=bridy /&gt;{{rp|35–36}} In an ''Ars Technica'' article, Cyrus Farivar said that the responsibility placed on the subscriber by the CAS for copyright infringement that occurred using the subscriber's connection would harm the availability of open Wi-Fi that small businesses make available to their customers.&lt;ref name=farivar /&gt; In a CCI blog post, Jill Lesser responded that many businesses with open Wi-Fi had business accounts, which were not subject to the CAS. Lesser also said that businesses offering open Wi-Fi through residential accounts would be subject to the CAS, but those accounts, like others subject to the CAS, would not be subject to termination.&lt;ref name=lesser&gt;{{cite web|last=Lesser|first=Jill|title=CAS Will Not Harm Public Wi-Fi|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/uncategorized/cas-will-not-harm-public-wi-fi/|publisher=Center for Copyright Information|accessdate=25 April 2013|date=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defense of publication before 1923 was the only allowable challenge to the copyright status of a work, even though a work may have been out of copyright protection for other reasons.&lt;ref name=EFF_FAQ /&gt;&lt;ref name=bridy /&gt;{{rp|36}} LaFrance criticized the presence of the "work published before 1923" defense but not other factual challenges to the copyright status of the work that she said could just as easily be resolved through the appeal process.&lt;ref name=lafrance /&gt;{{rp|178}}

The subscriber's personal information was not shared with the copyright holder in the appeal process unless the subscriber asserted the defense of authorization and the arbitrator deemed disclosure necessary for the copyright holder to respond to the defense.&lt;ref name=bridy /&gt;{{rp|50}} Bridy favorably compared the privacy of an appeal proceeding to the previous system of "mass John Doe litigation".&lt;ref name=bridy /&gt;{{rp|51}} The appeals process involved no hearings and no [[discovery (law)|discovery]], although the arbitrator could demand additional information from either party.&lt;ref name=bridy /&gt;{{rp|54}}

The CCI said that subscribers may also challenge alerts or mitigation measures in court;&lt;ref name=alert-wrongly-sent/&gt; Bridy presumed that such a challenge could be made in the form of a request for [[declaratory judgment]] that the subscriber did not infringe.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|55}}
Mary LaFrance wrote that the system prevented any party from introducing a decision from the appeal process into any judicial proceeding.&lt;ref name=lafrance&gt;{{cite journal|last=LaFrance|first=Mary|title=Graduated Response by Industry Compact: Piercing the Black Box|journal=Cardozo Arts &amp; Entertainment Law Journal|year=2012|volume=30|pages=165–186|url=http://www.cardozoaelj.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/LaFrance.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|175}} According to the CCI, the failure of a subscriber to appeal a copyright alert under the Copyright Alert System "will not be construed as an admission or waiver in any other proceeding".&lt;ref name=independent-review-faqs&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent Review FAQs|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/resources-faq/independent-review-faqs/|work=The Copyright Alert System|publisher=Center for Copyright Information|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bridy wrote that the copyright law applied in independent reviews would be determined by an expert commissioned by the American Arbitration Association and approved by CCI, who was required to hear "prevailing legal principles" of copyright law as viewed by copyright owners.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|55}} Bridy suggested that the legal standards in an independent review would call into question the fairness of the independent review proceeding, citing what she said were inaccurate statements from the RIAA on copyright.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|56}} Bridy also said that the lack of written decisions in the independent review process would make it difficult to determine what the rules are for independent review or whether they are being followed.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|57}}

The EFF said that the mitigation measures could be imposed without any [[due process]], placing the burden of proof on consumers to show that allegations of copyright infringement are unfounded. The organization recommended that, in the absence of copyright infringement detection systems which have been demonstrated to be entirely accurate, the burden of proof be placed on the content providers to show copyright infringement prior to the mitigation measures. Bridy wrote that IP address collection and content identification methods should be held to a much higher standard (including review by an independent expert with no contractual obligations to the CCI nor non-disclosure obligations), especially since an alert itself could trigger a sanction.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|53}}

The EFF argued that the procedure for objecting to an alert was unfairly burdensome to the consumer and biased towards the media companies.&lt;ref name="EFFReaction" /&gt; Bridy said that because the Copyright Alert System arose from a mass consumer contract, the potential for the [[repeat-player effect]] to jeopardize the neutrality of the arbitrators was present.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|55}} However, Bridy wrote that the independent review process was optional, and users were free to go to court to remove alerts or challenge mitigation measures, unlike in other consumer contracts where arbitration was mandatory. Although Bridy said that few subscribers would go to court owing to the possibility of a large damages award, this alternative allowed for full due process safeguards.&lt;ref name=bridy /&gt;{{rp|55}}

According to a May 2014 report by the Center for Copyright Information, from the implementation of the Copyright Alert System through the end of 2013, there were 265 appeals, representing 0.27% of the alerts triggering a mitigation measure for which the appeal process was available.&lt;ref name=copyright-alert-system-phase-one /&gt;{{rp|2}} Of the appeals, 47 (17.7%) were successful, the "vast majority" of which involved the "unauthorized use of account" defense.&lt;ref name=copyright-alert-system-phase-one&gt;{{cite web|title=The Copyright Alert System: Phase One and Beyond|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Phase-One-And_Beyond.pdf|accessdate=29 May 2014|author=Center for Copyright Information|date=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name=kravets&gt;{{cite web|last=Kravets|first=David|title=ISPs sent 1.3M copyright infringement notices to US customers last year|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/isps-sent-1-3m-copyright-infringement-notices-to-us-customers-last-year/|work=Ars Technica|publisher=Condé Nast|accessdate=29 May 2014|date=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In none of the appeals was it determined that an account or copyrighted work was misidentified.&lt;ref name=copyright-alert-system-phase-one /&gt;{{rp|10}}

The negotiating parties completed a [[memorandum of understanding|Memorandum of Understanding]] in July 2011 and amended it in August 2011 and October 2012.&lt;ref name=MOU&gt;[http://www.copyrightinformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Memorandum-of-Understanding.pdf Memorandum of Understanding]; [http://www.copyrightinformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CCI-MOU-First-Amendment.pdf Aug. 2011 amendment]; [http://www.copyrightinformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CCI-MOU-Second-Amendment.pdf Oct. 2012 amendment].&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement establishes the framework for the Copyright Alert System, establishing the roles and expectations of the ISPs, the copyright owners, and the monitoring services.

The Copyright Alert System launched in late February 2013.&lt;ref name="implementationrollout"/&gt;

The EFF cited a number of problems with the Memorandum of Understanding.&lt;ref name="EFFReaction"&gt;McSherry, Corynne and Goldman, Eric, [https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/07/graduated-response-deal-what-if-users-had-been "The "Graduated Response" Deal: What if Users Had Been At the Table?"], Electronic Frontier Foundation, July 18, 2011. Retrieved November 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, the EFF criticized the lack of subscriber representation in the CCI, noting that the establishment of the CCI involved only large media corporations and ISPs, but left out representatives of the subscribers who purchase these companies' products. Further, the CCI only allowed for a three-person advisory board from consumer interest groups, while the executive board is composed of six representatives from the media companies and ISPs, an arrangement which the EFF believed to be inadequate for consumer representation.

===Technology review===
The CCI contracted with [[Stroz Friedberg]], a global digital risk management and investigations firm, to conduct an analysis of MarkMonitor's system for monitoring, verifying, and enforcing online copyright infringement on P2P file sharing networks.&lt;ref name=Stroz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Independent-Expert-Assessment-Content-CCI-Redacted.pdf |title=Independent Expert Assessment of MarkMonitor AntiPiracy Methodologies [Redacted] |date=November 1, 2012 |accessdate=2013-03-03 |author=Stroz Friedberg, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stroz Friedberg assessed the efficacy of MarkMonitor's methodologies to monitor, identify, collect evidence, and generate notices to P2P infringers&lt;ref name=Stroz/&gt; The contractor published the findings in a confidential report to the CCI in November 2012 (i.e., before the system launched), concluding that the methodologies were "well developed and robust", though not without room for improvement.&lt;ref name=Stroz/&gt;

The publicly released version of the report contained a number of redactions of various details.&lt;ref name=Stroz/&gt; Among the report's conclusions were the following claims:&lt;ref name=Stroz/&gt;
* "MarkMonitor's methodologies effectively identify P2P online copyright infringers".
* "MarkMonitor's evidence collection in connection with P2P infringement is robust, defensible, and will withstand adverse party scrutiny or evidentiary challenges".
* "The methodologies include appropriate checks and balances at key points in the workflow to ensure accuracy".

Although both the CCI and Stroz Friedberg claimed the review was independent, the CCI didn't release the Stroz Friedberg report until after media reports surfaced that Stroz Friedberg was an RIAA [[lobbying]] organization from 2004 to 2009.&lt;ref name="EFF201211"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ArsBio&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/03/riaa-lobbyist-becomes-federal-judge-rules-on-file-sharing-cases/ |title=RIAA lobbyist becomes federal judge, rules on file-sharing cases |date=Mar 28, 2011 |last=Anderson | first=Nate |publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |accessdate=2013-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm's sole lobbyist for the RIAA (and, briefly, [[Universal Music Group]])&lt;ref name=ArsBio/&gt;&lt;ref name=UMG_lobbying&gt;Stroz Frieberg lobbying data (public record) as published by OpenSecrets.org for [http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firmlbs.php?id=F27199&amp;year=2005 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Beryl A.

In response to the "questions" raised, the CCI issued a statement reaffirming confidence in Stroz Friedberg's propriety and announcing the public release of the report, but also conceding, {{cquote|we are, however, sensitive to any appearance that Stroz lacks independence, and so CCI has decided to have another expert review Stroz's initial evaluation of the content community's processes.

The CCI also hired Stroz Friedberg to review the accuracy of the system by which ISPs match the IP addresses of suspected infringers to the ISPs' subscribers. The results of that review have not yet been publicly released.&lt;ref name=EFF201211/&gt;

In August 2013, the CCI announced it had hired [[Avi Rubin]]'s high-tech litigation consulting firm Harbor Labs to conduct a follow-up review.&lt;ref name=rubin&gt;{{cite web |url=https://torrentfreak.com/six-strikes-anti-piracy-system-gets-new-evidence-review-130817/ |title=Six Strikes Anti-Piracy System Gets New Evidence Review |date=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, Harbor Labs completed a limited review of MarkMonitor's system, concluding that the technical design was generally sound, but that the company needs to improve its safeguards against human error and internal malfeasance.&lt;ref name="harbor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Harbor-Labs-Executive-Summary.pdf |title=Evaluation of the MarkMonitor AntiPiracy System |date=March 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of the report was publicly disclosed when the CCI posted the report's executive summary eight months later.

==Reception and controversy==
&lt;!--NOTE TO EDITORS: Opinions in reliable sources about specific aspects of the CAS should be placed in the appropriate section. --&gt;
The White House supported the Memorandum of Understanding, calling it "a positive step and consistent with our strategy of encouraging voluntary efforts to strengthen online intellectual property enforcement and with our broader Internet policy principles, emphasizing privacy, free speech, competition and due process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/07/07/working-together-stop-internet-piracy|publisher=White House|date=July 7, 2011|title=Working Together to Stop Internet Piracy|last=Espinel|first=Victoria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the CAS was criticized for a perceived lack of public input, [[perverse incentive]]s between media corporations and ISPs, harsh mitigation measures, and reversal of [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] standards.&lt;ref name="TechDirt"&gt;Masnick, Mike, [http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110707/10173014998/major-us-isps-agree-to-five-strikes-plan-rather-than-three.shtml "Major US ISPs Agree To Five Strikes Plan, Rather Than Three"], Techdirt.com, July 7, 2011. Retrieved November 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The EFF made particularly detailed criticisms.&lt;ref name="EFFSameDay"&gt;Phillips, Abigail, [https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/07/content-industry-and-isps-announce-common "The Content Industry and ISPs Announce a "Common Framework for Copyright Alerts": What Does it Mean for Users?"], Electronic Frontier Foundation, July 7, 2011. Retrieved November 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, a [[Freedom of Information Act]] request related to the White House's role in the policy was denied by a Washington D.C. federal court.&lt;ref name="ars1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/federal-court-obama-admin-doesnt-need-to-release-more-six-strikes-documents/ | title=Federal court: Obama admin doesn't need to release more "six strikes" documents | publisher=Ars Technica | accessdate=April 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Soghoian, a policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), submitted the request to obtain information about the interaction in creating the policy.&lt;ref name=ars1 /&gt; It was denied in a summary judgement by Judge Royce C. Lamberth.&lt;ref name=ars1 /&gt; Lamberth's judgement rests on an exemption for drafts and "...reducing the possibility of misleading the public by disclosing documents that suggest certain reasons for a future decision that do not ultimately bear upon that decision".&lt;ref name=ars1 /&gt;

In 2012, the California ISP [[Sonic.net]] CEO told [[TorrentFreak]] that his ISP will not be participating in the Copyright Alert System, saying that ISPs are not equipped to police the actions of individuals, and that the [[MPAA]] and [[RIAA]] have not invited small, independent ISPs to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Has Your ISP Joined the US "Six Strikes" Anti-Piracy Scheme?|url=http://torrentfreak.com/isp-six-strikes-anti-piracy-scheme-120803/|accessdate=7 August 2012|newspaper=TorrentFreak|date=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly a representative of Cox Communications told TorrentFreak that they "have decided not to participate for internal reasons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ernesto|last=Van der Sar|title=MPAA / RIAA PONDER SUING PERSISTENT BITTORRENT PIRATES|url=http://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-riaa-ponder-suing-persistent-bittorrent-pirates-120618/|publisher=TorrentFreak|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the CAS' launch, concern existed that data collected for the CAS would be used for more than just the stated "educational" purposes. In the first draft of the CCI's Memorandum of Understanding, it was stated that upon that ISPs would be responsible for providing information collected under the CAS program to Content Owners "if it elects to initiate a legal action against the subscriber". The final agreed Memorandum of Understanding replaced the term "legal action" with "copyright infringement action". [footnote 12 – MOU Art 4 g iv.] Two months after the CAS's implementation, [[Verizon]] was subpoenaed to provide a third party plaintiff with information on its users which it recorded for CAS purposes. The plaintiff, Malibu Media argued that "DMCA notices and six strike alerts are relevant because these notices may prove a pattern of infringement and/or notice that infringement is occurring could be used to show a pattern of infringing behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malibu Media LLC v.

With this information, Malibu Media was able to successfully litigate the first BitTorrent copyright infringement case in American legal history which concluded with a verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bellwether Trial (Malibu Media v.

===Open wireless networks===
Tech law professor Derek Bambauer of the [[University of Arizona]], told [[Ars Technica]] that the Copyright Alert System "is fundamentally flawed". Bambauer says that injustice could result in the case where a user legally downloaded an entire work under the doctrine of [[fair use]], but the CAS still treated the user as an infringer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weber|first=Peter|title=The anti-piracy Copyright Alert System: Is the Napster era finally dead?|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/240718/the-anti-piracy-copyright-alert-system-is-the-napster-era-finally-dead|publisher=The Week Publications|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EFF said that the CAS will hinder the Open Wireless Movement's goals. Jill Lesser, Executive Director of the Center for Copyright Information, said that the CAS will affect small businesses that use a residential connection for open Wi-Fi: "Depending on the type of Internet service they subscribe to, very small businesses like a home-office or a local real estate office may have an Internet connection that is similar from a network perspective to a residential connection... The practical result is that if an employee of the small business, or someone using an open Wi-Fi connection at the business, engages in infringing activity the primary account owner would receive alerts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kamdar|first=Adi|title=Don't Be Fooled: "Six Strikes" Will Undoubtedly Harm Open Wireless|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/02/six-strikes-undoubtedly-harm-open-wireless|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects since implementation===
[[File:Copyright-alerts-chart.svg|thumb|300px|Distribution of the number of copyright alerts received by accounts during the first ten months of implementation of the Copyright Alert System.]]
According to Jill Lesser, the Executive Director of the CCI, the CAS's first year was successful as the CAS is "intended to be education based".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tummarello|first=Kate|title='Six strikes' thwarting piracy, leader says|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/199124-six-strikes-thwarting-piracy-leader-says|publisher=The Hill|accessdate=6 March 2014|date=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lesser indicated that changes for 2014 might include expanding the program to more Internet service providers and also start including other forms of copyrighted media, such as software. In the first year of the CAS's existence, US traffic to The Pirate Bay increased by 31 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ernesto|title=SIX-STRIKES FAILS TO HALT U.S. PIRATE BAY GROWTH|url=http://torrentfreak.com/six-strikes-fails-to-halt-u-s-pirate-bay-growth-130903/|publisher=Torrent Freak|accessdate=6 March 2014|date=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013 Warner Brothers Studios began sending warning to users whose internet service was provided by an entity other than one of the five ISP partners of the CCI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Jared|title=Warner Bros. fines file-sharers, even without six strikes|url=http://www.techhive.com/article/2041027/warner-bros-fines-file-sharers-even-without-six-strikes.html|publisher=TechHives|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, Variety revealed that engineers at [[Comcast]] and [[NBC Universal]] were developing technology designed to recognize the illegal downloading of copyrighted material by its users and launch a pop-up window with links to legal access to such content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallenstein|first=Andrew|title=Comcast Developing Anti-Piracy Alternative to 'Six Strikes' (Exclusive)|url=https://variety.com/2013/digital/news/comcast-developing-anti-piracy-alternative-to-six-strikes-exclusive-1200572790/|publisher=Variety|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not a CCI-backed initiative, but rather was viewed as a potential supplement to the CAS as Comcast had begun approaching other content owners and ISPs to explore the concept with them. In the CAS's first year, [[Comcast]], the nation's largest ISP, sent out 625,000 warnings to its users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morran|first=Chris|title=COMCASTIC 3 Report: Comcast Sends Out Around 1,800 Copyright Alert Notices Each Day|url=http://consumerist.com/2014/02/07/report-comcast-sends-out-around-1800-copyright-alert-notices-each-day/|publisher=Consumerist|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Largely seen as another supplement to the CAS, in September 2013, AT&amp;T applied for a patent for technology that would allow the company to "prevent bandwidth abuse" by tracking the content its users are sharing via BitTorrent and other P2P networks in order to charge its users for excessive bandwidth use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morran|first=Chris|title=DISPATCH FROM THE DEATH STAR 1 AT&amp;T Patents System That Could Charge File-Sharers Extra For Data|url=http://consumerist.com/2014/01/31/att-patents-system-that-could-charge-file-sharers-extra-for-data/|publisher=Consumerisst|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Distichs of Cato''''' ([[Latin]]: ''Catonis Disticha'', most famously known simply as '''Cato'''), is a [[Latin]] collection of proverbial wisdom and morality by an unknown author named '''Dionysius Cato''' from the 3rd or 4th century AD. The ''Cato'' was the most popular medieval schoolbook for teaching Latin, prized not only as a Latin textbook, but as a moral compass. Cato was in common use as a Latin teaching aid as late as the 18th century, used by [[Benjamin Franklin]].  It was one of the best-known books in the [[Middle Ages]] and was translated into many languages.

==Background==
Cato was the most popular Latin textbook during the Middle Ages, prized not only as a Latin textbook, but as a moral compass for impressionable students. It was translated into many languages, including [[Old Norse language|Norse]].  

{{rquote|right|''He knew nat Catoun, for his wit was rude.''|''[[Canterbury Tales]]''}}

[[Geoffrey Chaucer]] referred to Cato in ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'', through which modern students, less versed in Latin, often first come upon it. 

The ''Distichs of Cato'' was most commonly referred to as simply "Cato". In the [[Middle Ages]] it was assumed the work had been written by [[Cato the Elder]], or even [[Cato the Younger]]. Cato the Elder was assumed to have included tracts of the prose in his ''Carmen de Moribus'', but this was found to be a later addition. It was eventually attributed to the anonymous author Dionysius Cato (also known as Catunculus) from the 3rd or 4th century AD, based upon evidence in a manuscript discussed by [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]] (1484–1558). This manuscript no longer exists, though Scaliger found it authoritative.

The Roman jurist [[Marcus Porcius Cato Licinianus|Licinianus]], son of Cato the Younger, wrote ''Liber Catonianus'', describing Cato as an honest man who opposed [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s excesses. It has been argued that Licinianus might be the original author of the ''Distichs of Cato''.&lt;ref&gt;Marin, P. "Cato the Younger: Myth and Reality", Ph.D (unpublished), UCD, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1513 [[Erasmus]] corrected and commented on the text in a new edition of his own. 

[[Corderius]] made the French translation, enriching it with commentaries on classical authors.  His work was aimed at children with a summary, verses and an analysis of the structure. It was actually a grammatical treatise.

There were several Spanish translations of the work of Corderius. From the first one in 1490 down to 1964, there are records of 6 Spanish translations. An authority on [[Michael Servetus]], González Echeverría&lt;ref&gt;2011  “The love for truth. Life and work of Michael Servetus”, (El amor a la verdad. Vida y obra de Miguel Servet.), printed by Navarro y Navarro, Zaragoza, collaboration with the Government of Navarre, Department of Institutional Relations and Education of the Government of Navarra, 607 pp, 64 illustrations.&lt;/ref&gt; presented at the [[International Society for the History of Medicine|ISHM]]&lt;ref&gt;2011 September 9th, Francisco González Echeverría VI International Meeting for the History of Medicine, Barcelona.New Discoveries on the biography of Michael De Villeneuve (Michael Servetus) &amp; New discoverys on the work of Michael De Villeneuve (Michael Servetus)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2000  “ Find of new editions of Bibles and of two ' lost ' grammatical works of Michael Servetus” and “ The doctor Michael Servetus was descendant of jews”, González Echeverría , Francisco Javier. Abstracts, 37th International Congress on the History of Medicine, September 10–15, 2000, Galveston, Texas, U.S.A., pp. 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt; the thesis that Servetus was actually the author of the anonymous Spanish translation of 1543 of this work of Corderius.

There were several English translations, one being that of [[John Kingston]] in 1584.

[[Benjamin Franklin]] probably studied Cato when he was at [[Boston Latin School]]. He cites Cato in ''[[Poor Richard's Almanac]]'' and believed in the moral advice with such fervor he was troubled to print [[James Logan (statesman)|James Logan]]'s translation called ''Cato's Moral Distichs Englished in Couplets'' in 1735, the first in the [[Thirteen Colonies|Colonies]]. Of its limited need in the morally [[puritan]] [[New England]] colonies, Franklin says:

::"It would be thought a Piece of Hypocrisy and pharisaical Ostentation in me, if I should say, that I print these Distichs more with a view to the Good of others than my own private Advantage: And indeed I cannot say it; for I confess, I have so great Confidence in the common Virtue and Good Sense of the People of this and the neighoring Provinces, that I expect to sell a very good impression."

"[[Distich]]" means closed couplets, a style of writing with two-liners. It is a collection of moral advice, each consisting of hexameters, in four books. Cato is not particularly Christian in character, but it is monotheistic.

===Sample distichs===
2.1. If you can, even remember to help people you don't know.&lt;br&gt;
More precious than a kingdom it is to gain friends by kindness. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
2.9. Do not disdain the powers of a small body;&lt;br&gt;
He may be strong in counsel (though) nature denies him strength.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
3.2. If you live rightly, do not worry about the words of bad people,&lt;br&gt;
It is not our call as to what each person says.

'''Documentary research''' is the use of outside sources, [[documents]], to support the viewpoint or argument of an [[academic]] work. The process of documentary research often involves some or all of conceptualising, using and assessing documents. The analysis of the documents in documentary research would be either quantitative or qualitative analysis (or both).&lt;ref&gt;Balihar, Sanghera, Qualitative research methods: documentary research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19565">'''Endre Tot''' (Endre TÓT) born in [[Sümeg]], [[Hungary]],1937 is a Hungarian artist who lives and works in [[Cologne]], Germany.

Tot participated in the [[Fluxus]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ben-vautier.com/2007/2007.php3?id_sujet=flux fluxus]&lt;/ref&gt; movement and is well known for his [[Mail art]] projects, the use of xerox copies and usage of rubber stamps with clear [[Conceptual art|conceptual]] text declarations. In some of them Tot declares: "We are glad if we are happy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hundertmark-gallery.com/artist-endre-tot.0.html Endré Tot]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 he shows "Who's Afraid of Nothing? Absent images" at [[Museum Ludwig]], Cologne, a continuation of a project called "Nothing is not nothing".

==The 60s – Experiments in Informel==
He studied at the Mural Department of the Hungarian College of Arts and Crafts from 1959 till 1965. He started to make informel paintings, an absolute novelty in Hungary, in the early 60s followed shortly by collages and works executed in the spirit of Pop Art and Minimal Art. He became attached in the mid-60s to a leading but neglected Avant-Garde painter, Dezső Korniss who highly appreciated his pioneering informel ventures. In 1968 and 1969 he joined his young Neo-Avant-Garde colleagues named collectively the Iparterv Group of Artists at two scandalous exhibitions heavily criticised by officialdom. A retrospective of his early works was staged at the Budapest Kiscelli Museum in 1989, his early pencil and ink drawings were shown at Székesfehérvár’s King Stephen Museum in 2003, while a comprehensive exhibition of his early works entitled „Early Works – from painted to unpainted pictures” at the Szombathely Gallery in 2004 presented most of his important works executed before his „My Unpainted Canvasses” (1970). After the political turn of 1989-1990 many of his major works executed back in the 60s were acquired by important Hungarian museums.

==The 70s – The Beginnings of Concept Art==
In 1970-71 he broke radically with painting and has since been pre-occupied with Concept Art. „Tót may well have possessed the most phenomenal painter talent among artists living East of Amsterdam. And yet, he voluntarily relinquished painting for the sake of a truth that he had gradually recognised to be even more important than painting.” (Géza Perneczky, writing in Új Művészet, October, 2003) As a farewell to his painter period he prepared his artist’s book „My Unpainted Canvasses” (1970), a virtual presentation of his canvasses never actually accomplished. Also in the early 70s, he evolved some of his basic ideas like "Nothing/Zer0", "Rains and Gladnesses" that were to permeate his works in subsequent decades.
The new media he employed in his art include telegrams, picture postcards, T-shirts, Xerox copies, typewriters, films, music, posters, graffiti, banners, actions, artist’s books, street newsreels.
Critics recognised his early „Absent Works” published by Cologne-based DuMont Verlag ("Aktuelle Kunst in Ost-Europa", 1972) to be the very first conceptual works stemming from Eastern-Europe, works that were to be greatly enhanced in subsequent decades. Some other conceptual works of his were also published in Achille Bonito Oliva’s „Europe/America: The Different Avant-Garde” (Milan, 1976).
„He entered the stage of mail art almost in the very first hour”, wrote J. M. Poison in his catalogue of 1971 entitled „Mail Art-Communication - A Distance-Concept”. His fellow mail art correspondents included his later friend Ben Vautier, John Armleder, George Brecht, Daniel Spoerri, Cosey Fanny Tutti, Genesis P-Orridge, Dieter Roth, Marina Abramovich, Ken Friedmann and his dog. His mail art was exhibited at the Paris Bi-Annual of 1972 together with art by such other mail art pioneers as Marcel Duchamp, Yves Klein, Richard Johnson, Ben Vautier, George Brecht. About his letters written with a zero code Pierre Restany, a friend of Yves Klein’s, wrote this in 1978: „In the immaterial zone of a concentrated (ZEROED) sensitivity Endre Tót appears to be the Yves Klein of mail art, a monochrome of postage.”
His first museum exhibition was staged by the Israel Museum in 1975. Since Hungary had severed its diplomatic relations with Israel in 1967, Tót was forced to smuggle his works out of Hungary in an adventurous way. His conceptual works (e.g. his Rainproof-ideas) executed between 1970 and 1974 were exhibited there simultaneously with Alberto Giacometti’s statues. Art magazines in Germany, Italy, and France took note of the exhibition with the Jerusalem Post commenting: "This is not to say that Endre Tot is the same race with Giacometti, but he is a totally new and rewarding experience."
In 1974, the Swiss Howeg Verlag published his sheet of stamps called Zero-Post among the very first artist’s stamps of international mail art.
At the invitation of John Armleder, his later friend who became world-famous for his Neo Geo movement, he spent half a year with the Ecart Gallery of Geneva, an institution also functioning as a mail art centre. It was during his stay in Geneva that he accomplished his first street action (TOTalJoys 1976) which was filmed and later issued on DVD by the Paris Bureau des Videos in 2005.
His artist’s books made in Budapest in the 70s earned him quite a lot of international praise. He had first published them on a samizdat basis but they were later republished by Western-European Avant-Garde publishers. 1971: „My Unpainted Canvasses”,  „The States of Zeros”, „Semmi sem semmi / Nothing ain't Nothing”, 1972: „Nothing”, „Incomplete Informations”, 1974: „Zero-Texts (1971-72)”, „Night Visit to the National Gallery” (Beau Geste Press, UK), „Zero-Post”, „Rainproof Ideas (1971-74)”, 1979: ”TÓTalJOYS”, 1981: ”Very Special Drawings”, 1990: „Evergreen Book”. In 1998, the Paris Bibliothèque Nationale bought several of his artist’s books. The library of the Paris Pompidou Centre acquired his Correspondence avec John Armleder (Ecart, Geneva, 1974) in 2010. His artist’s books were exhibited in many European, American and Canadian museums including the Pompidou Centre’s „Livres d'Artistes” exhibition of 1985.
He was still a resident of Budapest when, in 1977, he exhibited with Galerie Bama, one of the best-known Paris galleries. His show was reviewed in L 'Express by Otto Hahn. Due to his international actions and mail art activities he counted in the West as one of the most notable Eastern-European artists, an appraisal hardly acknowledged in his native country.
He was plucked from the isolation of his Óbuda apartment in the late 70s by an invitation coming from the Berlin Artist Program of DAAD. His applications for an exit permit had been refused by the authorities several times which created a political sensation in the Western press, a circumstance that eventually earned him a permit. After staying in Berlin for a year Tót opted for emigration. His Óbuda apartment was confiscated but his sibling had evacuated his works stored there in the nick of time. After being stored in various low-key places, they were eventually deposited with the Hungarian National Gallery in an orderly fashion.
It was in West-Berlin that Tót came to realise the ideas that he had taken with him in his suitcase and in his mind from Budapest. Shortly after arriving, he placed the following inscription upon the Berlin Wall: „Ich würde mich freuen, wenn ich etwas auf die andere Seite der Mauer schreiben dürfte” (I should be glad if I were allowed to write something on the other side of this wall). He demonstrated his joys ("TÓTalJOYs") with posters in his hand or upon his back in the busiest spots of the metropolis. He even placed a flickering sentence speaking about his joy among the news items of a street newsreel atop a Kurfürstendamm building. In 1978 DAAD filmed and published in book form his street action named TOTalJOYS. He twice exhibited his works with Galerie René Block, an institution previously hosting such notables as Joseph Beuys, Richard Hamilton, Allan Kaprow, Nam June Paik, Wolf Vostell. The irony inherent in his actions and mail art definitely links him up with the fluxus movement in Germany. He was the sole Eastern-European protagonist of the itinerant exhibition organised by René Block entitled „Fluxus in Germany 1962-1992”.

==The 80s – Blackout in Cologne==
After a stay of one and a half years in Berlin he moved to Cologne with his German wife Herta. The first years of his Cologne period were much less productive than his stay in Berlin. He hardly ever worked until the mid-80s. Invited by Artist Place, he flew to New York City in 1982 with a piece of chalk in his pocket that he used for placing graffiti on the walls of the gallery. It was here that he met up with a great number of notable artists including Alan Kaprow and his friend of old, John Armleder.
With the „blackout years” gone, as he himself called them, he started to work again feverishly from the late 80s on. He elaborated on the idea of „absent paintings”, an idea dating back to his Budapest years (My Unpainted Canvasses, 1970, Night Visit to the National Gallery, A Visit to the Museum,  both in 1974). With his „absent paintings” he accomplished a virtual return to painting but this was tantamount in his case to its final destruction. The spirit nurturing his Blackout and Catalogued paintings comes from an aesthetics of dearth[1] . Conceived in an aesthetics of disappearance, his „absent” works attempt to visualise nothing and void itself. His large work entitled „Dada Messe in Berlin” was exhibited at the show ICONOCLASH: Beyond the Image Wars in Science, Religion and Art (ZKM, Karlsruhe, 2002) presenting major iconoclastic works by Dürer, Rembrandt, Goya, Duchamp, Malevich, Picabia, Warhol, Beuys etc. At the Bremen exhibition „Who Killed the Painting?” (Museum für Moderne Kunst, 2010) his large triptych „Fluxus Triptichon” (2002, 3 x 200 x 125&amp;nbsp;cm) was on view alongside works by Beuys, Kaprow, Ben Vautier, G. Brecht, Al Hausen, Nam June Paik etc.

==The 90s – Retrospectives and Entering the Canon==
After the political change of 1989-1990 in Hungary Tót returned to his native country with his works created abroad. He filled all 12 exhibiting halls of the Palace of the Arts with them under the evocative title of „Nothing is Nothing”. Four years later he exhibited with the Cologne Ludwig Museum (Who is afraid of Nothing?), and this selection of his works was re-exhibited with the Budapest branch of the Ludwig Museum in 1999. Tót is the first Hungarian artist to have been asked to put on an individual show at the Kassel Documenta. Curators there insisted on using the Hungarian title of his Budapest show (Semmi sem semmi) probably because they liked its exotic sound. His action on the city’s main square involving him distributing flyers with a black mask hiding his face was cut short by the police even though the flyers contained no information at all. Along with his works accomplished in his studio, his street actions have also helped him achieve international fame. 
„I am glad that I have stood here” – this was inscribed in Hungarian on his bronze plaque placed in the pavement in 1998 in front of [[Artpool Art Research Center|Artpool's]] art space in Budapest (60, Paulay Ede St.). Six years later a similarly inscribed plaque („Ich freue mich, dass ich hier gestanden habe”) was placed in the floor of the roof terrace of the Cologne Ludwig Museum. 
His Flyer, Zero, Joy etc. street actions as satellite events to international exhibitions have embarrassed or enraged passers-by in many cities over the decades, not infrequently causing even the police to intervene. International critics usually evaluate those anti-demonstrations by Tót to be responses to the mandatory political demonstrations that he had lived through as a young man in totalitarian Hungary.

==The 2000s==
A photo documentation of Tót’s earliest street action was exhibited at the international show „Protest &amp; Survive” put on by the famous London Whitechapel Gallery. Requested by the curators, he also re-staged his remarkable Geneva street action. The catalogue said this about his actions: „Tót's response to the censorship, isolation and suppression inherent in a totalitarian state was to produce his series of joy”. At the exhibition staged by the Vienna Kunstforum entitled „Superstars von Warhol bis Madonna” (2005) his conceptual paperwork „depicting” or rather just marking Mona Lisa’s (absent) smile was on view alongside Duchamps’ famous moustached Mona Lisa. 
The New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) had acquired several works of his created during his Budapest isolation and exhibited them in 2006 at its show „Eye on Europe – 1960 to Now”. Along with Czech artist Milan Knizak, Tót was the only exhibiting artist coming from Eastern Europe. Two years later MoMA director Glenn D. Lowry presented an Honorary Artist Membership to him.

==The 2010s – Tót in Collections==
In 2010 he exhibited with such wide-ranging institutions as Neues Museum Nürnberg, Museum für Moderne Kunst Wesenburg - Bremen, Centre Georges Pompidou Paris, The V. Koc Foundation Contemporary Art Collection Istanbul. The Pompidou Centre’s catalogue published a copy of his 1975 letter to Pierre Restany ending with the words: „So I'm fucked with my zer0000000000000s”. Simultaneously, the Paris Hungarian Institute staged a show of the Iparterv Group of Artists (Le Progrés de l'Illusion), where Tót’s early (1966/67) informel paintings and paperworks were also on view.
His conceptual works were acquired from 1975 through 2010 by such major collections as those of MoMA New York, Getty Museum Los Angeles, Museum Ludwig Köln, Neue Nationalgalerie Berlin, Israel Museum Jerusalem, Haags Gemeentemuseum The Hague, and the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts as well as East-Central European museums like National Gallery Prague, Museum Stuki Łódź, Museum of Modern Art Ljubjana, National Gallery of Art Varsaw, Museum of Modern Art Olmütz, Hungarian National Gallery, Ludwig Museum Budapest, or even two museums in Latin-America: the Center de Arte y Communication (CAYC) Buenos Aires, and the Museu de Arte Contemporaneu da Universidade de São Paulo. 
Probably more than a hundred of his major works are preserved in such notable private collections as Sammlung Dr. Speck (Cologne), Sammlung René Block (Berlin), Das Archive Sohm (Stuttgart), The Sacker Archive of Concrete und Visual Poetry (Miami Beach, Florida).
In 2009 he published a memoir entitled „I’m glad that I can write one sentence after another” with Noran Publishers, Budapest. A critic wrote this about the book: „This is half-way between a logbook and an autonomous work of art since the primacy of the text is questioned throughout by its unusual layout and illustrations… The account Tót gives of his youthful love-affair is deeply moving, the way he recalls the relationship of the regime towards its artists in the 60s and 70s, convincing, and the list of his fleeting affairs with girls is very funny.”
Due to the extreme multiplicity of Tót’s oeuvre, it is next to impossible to understand his art without a thorough-going theoretical back-up.

The '''Evangelical Press Association''' is a professional association serving the [[Christian]] periodical publishing industry, including magazines, newspapers, newsletters, and content-rich websites. Its members produce some 200 periodical titles with a combined circulation of over 15 million.&lt;ref&gt;lkeener 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; EPA is a religious and educational [[non-profit corporation]] under the laws of the state of [[California]]. It is managed by an executive director, who is responsible to a board of six directors. &lt;ref&gt;lkeener 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

:The EPA seeks to promote the cause of [[evangelical Christianity]] and to enhance the influence of Christian journalism by: &lt;ref&gt;lkeener 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* providing resources and training to enhance competency and effectiveness;
:* promoting the highest standards of professionalism, accountability, and authenticity of viewpoint;
:* fostering Christian fellowship among members of the Association;
:* rendering practical assistance;
:* stimulating mutual helpfulness among members;
:* and encouraging high ethical and technical standards in the field of Christian journalism.

==Beginnings &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evangelicalpress.com/about-epa/history-of-epa/ History of EPA].&lt;/ref&gt;==
In the fall of 1947, a handful of editors met at the convention of the National Sunday School Association and began to talk about an association of evangelical editors. Dr. James DeForest Murch, editor of United Evangelical Action, took the lead and called together a [[pro tem]] committee in [[Chicago]] on May 6, 1948. Thirty-five editors met at the Congress Hotel in Chicago. They officially organized the Evangelical Press Association, adopted the doctrinal statement of the National Association of Evangelicals and wrote the statement of purpose printed above. On April 4–6, 1949, the first annual convention of the EPA met in Chicago with 103 publications represented.

In September, 1951, the association mailed the first copies of a news service to its members. It was produced by volunteers who sent out ten releases in the first five months. In 1952 it became a weekly service with a subscription rate of $10 a year. That year also the association began its newsletter, Liaison. In 1954 the association adopted a code of ethics and began an awards program.

EPA has held an annual convention each year since 1949. The conventions were held in Chicago until 1957, then moved to a different city each year after that. The conventions were held in January until 1963 when the date was changed to April or May.

As the association grew, it demanded an executive secretary to carry on the administrative work and edit the news service. This became a half-time paid position. In 1978, the job of executive secretary was changed to executive director, and the director was charged with giving vision and leadership to the organization. The news service was licensed to an independent news organization, and in 1994 the news service was sold.

==Programs and services &lt;ref&gt;lkeener 2016&lt;/ref&gt;==
Held each Spring, the annual convention is the focal point of the EPA year. The 3-day convention rotates among major cities throughout the U.S. The goal is to provide three days of learning, sharing, networking, and fellowship, as well as to conduct official association business.

EPA conventions offer speakers of national stature, the annual awards contest, the annual membership meeting and election, occasional tours, and a wide variety of workshops designed for editors, writers, graphic designers, photographers, social media managers, web content managers, and business personnel—from  beginners to veterans, and for both print and digital application.

EPA hosts two annual contests: the Awards of Excellence contest (for a publication as a whole) and the Higher Goals contest (for the individual pieces produced—writing, photography, design, etc.). 

Other programs and services include press credentials, one-on-one publication critique, scholarships for undergraduate journalism students, an ethics committee to hear complaints, webinars, a legal hotline and various member benefits and discounts from selected suppliers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3552">The '''Foundation for Open Project Documentation''' &lt;ref&gt;[[Shalyto|Shalyto A.]][http://www.codeproject.com/gen/design/nifopd.asp Foundation for Open Project Documentation at Code Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619170857/http://www.codeproject.com/gen/design/nifopd.asp |date=2006-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
is an organization. Its main idea is to create detailed and public documentation for all stages of software creation. The foundation was established in 2002 on the grand opening of the semifinals of [[ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] by [[Anatoly Shalyto]]. This foundation was announced on the [[Linux Summit]] 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://is.ifmo.ru/foundation/linux/ Part of the program of Linux Summit 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Shalyto|Shalyto A.]] Naumov L.

[[Image:Shalyto Linux Summit 2004.jpeg|thumb|250px|right|[[Anatoly Shalyto]] on [[Linux Summit]] 2004, Helsinki ]]

== Motivation ==
The motivation for creating ''detailed'' documentation is considered the following:
* software quality increases
* program verification simplifies
* project modification becomes easier and safer

The motivation for making documentation ''open'' is considered the following:
* project becomes less dependent on its initial authors
* other people can easily understand structure and behaviour of a program
* design decisions reuse becomes easier and safer
* it becomes possible to use real project for study purposes

== Application ==
Foundation for Open Project Documentation gives a project a greater understandability and re-usability potential, than [[open source software|Open Source foundation]]. It is loosely connected with [[Free Software Foundation]]. OpenDoc project can also be commercial.

== Main principles ==
* The project documentation should be a base for source code, but not vice versa.
* The documentation should describe not only the final product, but also the creation process.
* The documentation should be easy to understand even for less qualified developers than its author.
* The documentation should be available every time anyone explores or modifies a project.

Fugitive inks which washed away when soaked in water were sometimes used deliberately to prevent [[postage stamp]]s being removed from envelopes by soaking, and reused (e.g., the [[Queen Victoria Lilac and Green Issue]]).

While permanent pigments are usually used for [[painting]]s, painters have made work wholly or partially with fugitive pigments for a number of reasons: availability and cost of pigments; being more concerned with the appearance of colors available only with fugitive pigments than with permanence; ignorance regarding the volatility of the pigments; or the desire to have a painting change in appearance over time.

{{Literature}}
'''Genre studies''' is an academic subject which studies '''genre theory''' as a branch of general [[critical theory]] in several different fields, including the literary or artistic, linguistic, or rhetorical.

Literary genre studies is a [[Structuralism#Structuralism in literary theory and literary criticism|structuralist]] approach to the study of [[genre]] and genre theory in [[literary theory]], [[film theory]], and other [[cultural theory|cultural theories]]. The study of a genre in this way examines the structural elements that combine in the [[narratology|telling of a story]] and finds patterns in collections of stories. When these elements (or [[Code (semiotics)|semiotic codes]]) begin to carry inherent information, a genre emerges.

Linguistic genre studies is best described by two schools of literary genre, the [[Systemic Functional Linguistics]] or "SFL", scholars of this school believe that language structure is an integral part of a text's social context and function.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi, Anis and Mary Jo Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction to History, Theory, Research, and Pedagogy.'' Colorado: Parlor Press and WAC Clearinghouse, 2010. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; SFL scholars often conduct research that focuses on genres usefulness in pedagogy.

[[English for Specific Purposes]] or "ESP" is another school of genre studies that examines the pedagogical implications of genre. ESP scholars focus on how genre can help non-native English speakers on how to use the language and its conventions through the application of genre analysis, the identification of discourse elements such as register, formation of conceptual and genre structures, modes of thought and action that exist in the specific discourse community, etc for bringing changes in epideictic schemata.&lt;ref name="Reif. p.41"&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Paul Gee|author2=Michael Handford|title=The Routledge Handbook of Discourse Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2T6-LHp8T8C&amp;pg=PA242|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-67292-7|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another one is Rhetorical Genre Studies or "RGS" studies genre as social action. RGS emerged from Carolyn R. Miller's article "Genre as Social Action".&lt;ref name="Reif. p.78"&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary and linguistic branches==

===Systemic functional linguistics===
{{main article|Systemic functional linguistics}}
Systemic functional linguistics scholars believe that language is organized within cultures based on cultural ideologies. The "systemic" of SFL refers to the system as a whole, in which linguistic choices are made. SFL is based largely on the work of Michael Halliday, who believed that individuals make linguistic choices based on the ideologies of the systems that those individuals inhabit. For Halliday, there is a "network of meanings" within a culture, that constitutes the "social semiotic" of that culture. This "social semiotic" is encoded and maintained by the discourse system of the culture.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, Michael. ''Language as Social Semiotic''. London: Edward Arnold, 1978. p.100, 13&lt;/ref&gt; For Halliday, contexts in which texts are produced recur, in what he calls "situation types." People raised within a specific culture become accustomed to the "situation types" that occur within that culture, and are more easily able to maneuver through the "situation types" within that culture than people who were not brought up within it.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.29-32&lt;/ref&gt;

Halliday's approach to cultural context in the formation of recurrent "situation types" influenced other scholars, such as J.R. Martin. Martin led the SFL pedagogical approach, which emphasized the role of context in text formation. Martin and his associates believed that process-based approaches to education ignored the cultural boundaries of texts, and privileged middle- and upper- class students at the expense of students from lower-class backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction.'' p.32&lt;/ref&gt; According to Martin and other SFL scholars, an explicit focus on genre in literature would help literacy teaching. Focusing on genre reveals the contexts that influences texts, and teaches those contexts to students, so that they can create texts that are culturally informed.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction.'' p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Through their genre work in schools, Martin and his associates developed a definition of genre as a "staged, goal-oriented, social process."&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Rose"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=J.R.|last2=Rose|first2=David|title=Genre relations: Mapping Culture|date=2008|publisher=Equinox Pub.|location=London|isbn=978-1845530488|page=6|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Martinian genre model, genres are staged because they accomplish tasks that require multiple steps; they are goal-oriented because their users are motivated to see the completion of the stages to the end; and they are social because users address their texts to specific audiences.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Rose"/&gt;

===English for Specific Purposes===
{{main article|English for Specific Purposes}}
English for Specific Purposes scholarship has been around since the 1960s, but ESP scholars did not begin using genre as a pedagogical approach until the 1980s, when [[John Swales]] published ''Genre Analysis: English in Academic and Research Settings'', in which Swales laid out the methodological approach that brought together ESP and genre analysis.&lt;ref name="Reif. p.41"/&gt; Swales identified two characteristics of ESP genre analysis: its focus on academic research in English and its use of genre analysis for applied ends.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.41-42&lt;/ref&gt; ESP focuses on specific genres within spheres of activity, such as the medical profession, but it also focuses on the broader concept of communicative purposes within fields of study.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

English for Specific Purposes shares some characteristics with SFL studies. Both believe that linguistic features are connected to social context and function, and both aim to help disadvantaged students grasp the system in which texts are created so that they can create similar texts, by teaching them the relationship between language and social function. Both try to accomplish their goals by teaching specific genres to underprivileged users.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.42-43&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are also some important differences between ESP and SFL. Whereas SFL scholars focus on teaching basic genre structures to primary and secondary school students, ESP scholars are focused on teaching Professional and Academic disciplinary genres to University- and graduate-level students. ESP students tend to be more bound to discursive genre subjects, within very particular contexts. ESP focuses on micro-level genres and contexts, whereas SFL focuses on macro-level contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.43-44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhetorical Genre Studies (RGS)===

Rhetorical Genre Studies (a term coined by Aviva Freedman) scholars examine genre as typified social action, as ways of acting based on recurrent social situations. This founding principle for RGS was taken from Carolyn R. Miller's essay "Genre as Social Action," which was published in 1984.&lt;ref name="Reif. p.78"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Carolyn R. "Genre as Social Action." ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' 70 (1984):151-167&lt;/ref&gt; In her article, Miller examines Frank Lloyd Bitzer's  notion of exigence as a reaction to social situations, and Kenneth Burke's notion of "motive" as human action.&lt;ref&gt;Miller. "Genre as Social Action." p.155&lt;/ref&gt; Using Bitzer, particularly, Miller believes it is possible to examine exigence as "an external cause of discourse."&lt;ref&gt;Miller. "Genre as Social Action." p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, she is able to view situations as social constructions. Genres are typified ways of responding to recurring social constructions.&lt;ref&gt;Miller. "Genre as Social Action."&lt;/ref&gt;

RGS scholarship has evolved beyond Miller's founding definition of genre. Carol Berkenkotter and Thomas Huckin begin with the notion that genre is knowledge foundation, and argue that genres embody communities' knowledge and ways of acting.&lt;ref name="Reif. p.78"/&gt; For Berkenkotter and Huckin, genre becomes a way of navigating social activity. As such, it is dynamic, because the conditions of social activity are always in flux. Recurrence, they claim, involves variation.&lt;ref name="Reif. p.79"&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.79&lt;/ref&gt; Berkenkotter and Huckin redefine genre as social cognition.&lt;ref name="Reif. p.79"/&gt;

The notion of "uptake" is also integral to RGS scholars' understanding of genre. Anne Freadman uses uptake to describe the ways in which genres interact with each other in her articles "Uptake" and "Anyone for Tennis?".&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre:An Introduction''. p.83-84&lt;/ref&gt; She uses the game of tennis to explain the ways genres interact. Tennis players, she says, do not exchange tennis balls, they exchange shots. Each shot only has meaning within the game, its rules, and the context of the game being play.&lt;ref&gt;Freadman, Anne. "Anyone for Tennis." ''Genre and the New Rhetoric''. Ed. Aviva Freedman and Peter Medway. Bristol: Taylor and Francis, 1994. p.43-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Shots are meaningful because they take place in a game. The game is meaningful because it takes place within "ceremonials." Thus, the final at Wimbledon provides a different context than a game between friends. Genres are the games that take place within ceremonials, and shots are utterances, or verbal exchanges. We cannot really understand a text without understanding the ceremonial in which it occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; "Uptake" is the illocutionary response elicited by particular situations.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Amy Devitt's research has further complicated the RGS landscape. In ''Writing Genres'', Devitt distinguishes between the "context of genres," "genre repertoires," "genre systems," and "genre sets." The "context of genres" is the overall set of genres available in a culture. A "genre repertoire" refers to the set of genres that a specific group uses to achieve its purposes. "Genre systems" are the sets of genres that function within an activity system. Finally, "genre sets" are more loosely defined sets of genres that function within an activity system, but only define a limited range of actions within that system.&lt;ref name="Reif. p.87"&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.87&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if we were to take a courtroom as an activity system, a genre set could be defined as only those genres used by the judge. Studying the "context of genres," "genre repertoires," "genre systems," and "genre sets" enables researchers to study the relationships and power structures of activity systems.&lt;ref name="Reif. p.87"/&gt;

==Generic conventions==
Conventions are usual indicators such as phrases, themes, quotations, or explanations that readers expect to find in a certain genre. They could be considered "[[stereotypes]]" of that genre. For example, [[Science fiction]] is expected to be set in the future, and have futuristic events, technological advances, and futuristic ideas. [[Realism (literature)|Realism]] is expected to contain a story about people who could pass as real, struggling through real-life situations and/or real world events, etc.

Critic Paul Alpers explains that literary conventions are like meeting places where past and present writers "come together" to determine the form a convention should take in a particular literary instance (work). In practical terms, this coming together is a matter of the present writer consulting the work of predecessors, but Alpers wants to connote the sense of active negotiation and accommodation that takes place between the writer and the genre he or she is working in (a genre defined by other people). According to Alpers, a misconception persists in modern criticism that literary convention is an "arbitrary and inflexible practice, established by widespread usage and imposed from without." Convention in this sense is the "antithesis of the personal and individual"; it is "felt to constrain the [writer]." Alpers reconceptualizes literary convention as something "constitutive and enabling." For him, generic conventions are "not fixed procedures imposed by impersonal tradition;" rather, they are the living "usages of other [writers]," "the shared practice of those who come together." Thinking of generic conventions as a practice shared by many users, allows later writers to exercise the same degree of control over convention as those who predated them. Far from constraining writers, convention provides flexibility to preserve certain aspects of a genre and transform others. Convention in this sense enables "individual expression, because the [writer] is seen as responsive to, even when challenging, his predecessors and fellows."&lt;ref&gt;Alpers, Paul. "Lycidas and Modern Criticism." ''English Literary History'' 49.2 (1982): 468-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Genre theorist [[David Fishelov]] also deals with generic conventions—he calls them "generic rules"—in elaborating his explanatory metaphor of "literary genres as social institutions" in the book ''Metaphors of Genre: The Role of Analogies in Genre Theory''. Fishelov, like Alpers, sees generic conventions as an inescapably "vital part of the literary communicative situation," linking present and past writers to each other, as well as to readers. Established conventions are "a challenge, or a horizon, against which the writer and his reader have to define themselves." The writer may respond to this challenge by "stretch[ing] the generic rules."&lt;ref name=Metaphors&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishelov|first=David|title=Metaphors of Genre: The Role of Analogies in Genre Theory.|year=1993|publisher=The Pennsylvania State UP|location=University Park, PA|pages=85–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fishelov draws his metaphor of genre as social institution from a passage in René Welleck and Austin Warren's ''Theory of Literature'':

:The literary kind [genre] is an ‘institution'—as Church, University, or State is an institution. It exists not as an animal exists or even as a building, chapel, library, or capital, but as an institution exists. One can work through, express oneself through, existing institutions, create new ones, or get on, so far as possible, without sharing in politics or rituals; one can also join, but then reshape institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Welleck, René and Austin Warren. ''Theory of Literature''. New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, Inc., 1942. p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;

This formulation ascribes agency to actors within social institutions. In the same way institutions like churches, universities, and states organize social actors to accomplish collective social purposes, literary genres organize relationships between writers and readers to accomplish communicative purposes, which change over time. Genres are not static, but rather, like social institutions, persist through the constant renovation of their conventions by individuals. Fishelov is particularly helpful in theorizing the role of the reader in alternately constraining and motivating generic change:

:[T]he reader demands compliance with the established generic conventions so that he can integrate the new text, but at the same time he expects the writer to manipulate these established conventions so that the new text is more than a tedious repetition of the generic tradition.&lt;ref name="Metaphors" /&gt;

Reader expectations operate as both a constraint on the writer and a "latent demand for innovation." The writer "is expected to manipulate the existing conventions and to carry them (at least) one step further…. From the writer's perspective, the generic convention is a model to follow but also a challenge to overcome." Fishelov explains that writers choose or are compelled to manipulate prevailing conventions for a variety of aesthetic and thematic reasons.

==History of genre theory==
Genre theory or genre studies got underway with the [[Greeks]].  The Greeks felt that the type of person an author was would be directly responsible for the type of poetry they wrote.  The Greeks also believed that certain metrical forms were suited only to certain genres. [[Aristotle]] said, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;We have, then, a natural instinct for representation and for tune and rhythm—and starting with these instincts men very gradually developed them until they produced poetry out of their improvisations.  Poetry then split into two kinds according to the poet's nature.  For the more serious poets represented the noble deeds of noble men, while those of a less exalted nature represented the actions of inferior men, at first writing satire just as the others wrote hymns and eulogies.&lt;/blockquote&gt; This is all based on [[Plato]]'s mimetic principle.  Exalted people will, in imitation of exaltation, write about exalted people doing exalted things, and vice versa with the "lower" types (Farrell, 383). Genre was not a black-and-white issue even for Aristotle, who recognized that though the "[[Iliad]]" is an epic it can be considered a tragedy as well, both because of its tone as well as the nobility of its characters.  However, most of the Greek critics were less acutely aware—if aware at all—of the inconsistencies in this system.  For these critics, there was no room for ambiguity in their literary taxonomy because these categories were thought to have innate qualities that could not be disregarded.

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] carried on the Greek tradition of literary criticism.  The Roman critics were quite happy to continue on in the assumption that there were essential differences between the types of [[poetry]] and [[drama]].  There is much evidence in their works that Roman writers themselves saw through these ideas and understood genres and how they function on a more advanced level.  However, it was the critics who left their mark on Roman literary criticism, and they were not innovators.

After the [[decline of the Roman Empire|fall of Rome]], when the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] system took over literary criticism, genre theory was still based on the essential nature of genres.  This is most likely because of [[Christianity]]'s affinity for Platonic concepts.  This state of affairs persisted until the 18th century.

===Enlightenment age===
At the end of the 18th century, the theory of genre based on [[classicism|classical]] thought began to unravel beneath the intellectual chafing of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].  The introduction of the [[printing press]] brought texts to a larger audience.  Then [[pamphlet]]s and [[Broadside (printing)|broadsides]] began to diffuse information even farther, and a greater number of less privileged members of society became literate and began to express their views.  Suddenly authors of both "[[High culture|high]]" and "[[Low culture|low]]" culture were now competing for the same audience.  This worked to destabilize the classical notions of genre, while still drawing attention to genre because new genres like the [[novel]] were being generated (Prince, 455).

[[John Locke|Locke]], in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690), had reduced data to its smallest part: the simple idea derived from sense.  However, as the science of cognition became more precise it was shown that even this simple idea derived from sense was itself divisible.  This new information prompted David Hartley to write in his ''Observation on Man'' (1749), &lt;blockquote&gt;How far the Number of Orders may go is impossible to say.  I see no Contradiction in supposing it infinite, and a great Difficulty in stopping at any particular Size. (Prince, 456). &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The possibility of an infinite number of types alarmed [[theology|theologians]] of the time because their assumption was that rigorously applied [[empiricism]] would uncover the underlying divine nature of creation, and now it appeared that rigorously applied empiricism would only uncover an ever-growing number of types and subsequent sub-types.

In order to re-establish the divine in categorization, the new taxonomical system of [[aesthetics]] arose.  This system offered first beauty, and then the sublime as the taxonomical device.  The problem with Aesthetics was that it assumed the divine and thus the sublime must underlie all these categories, and thus, the ugly would become beautiful at some point.  The paradox is glaring.

===Evolution===
Ever since the late 18th century literary critics have been trying to find a theory of genre that would be more commensurate with the realities of individual texts within genres.  The evolution of genre took many twists and turns through the 19th and 20th centuries. It was heavily influenced by the [[deconstruction]]ist thought and the concept of [[relativism|relativity]].  In 1980, the instability engendered by these two new modes of thought came to a head in a paper written by [[Jacques Derrida]] titled, "The Law of Genre."&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, Jacques. "The Law of Genre." ''Critical Inquiry'' 7.1 (1980):55-81&lt;/ref&gt;  In the article Derrida first articulates the idea that individual texts participate in rather than belong to certain genres.  He does this by demonstrating that the "mark of genre" is not itself a member of a genre or type.  Thus, the very characteristic that signifies genre defies classification.  However, at the end of this essay, Derrida hints at what might be a more fruitful direction for genre theory.  "There, that is the whole of it, it is only what 'I,' so that say, here kneeling at the edge of literature, can see.  In sum, the law.  The law summoning: what 'I' can sight and what 'I' can say that I sight in this site of a recitation where I/we is."&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, Jacques. "The Law of Genre." p.81&lt;/ref&gt;  By which Derrida means that not only is taxonomy a [[subjectivity|subjective]] sport, but due to this very fact, ''the place and time the taxonomical act takes place'' deserves further study.

Then, in 1986, Ralph Cohen published a paper in response to Derrida's thoughts titled "History and Genre."  In this article Cohen argued that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;genre concepts in theory and in practice arise, change, and decline for historical reasons.  And since each genre is composed of texts that accrue, the grouping is a process, not a determinate category.  Genres are open categories.  Each member alters the genre by adding, contradicting, or changing constituents, especially those of members most closely related to it.  The process by which genres are established always involves the human need for distinction and interrelation.  Since the purposes of critics who establish genres vary, it is self-evident that the same texts can belong to different groupings of genres and serve different generic purposes. (Cohen, 204)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Genre Evolution in RGS''

RGS scholars largely agree that while genres are indeed dynamic and constantly evolving entities, they are difficult to change. [[Amy Devitt]] describes this bind, as she considers a genre to be "both the product and the process that creates it" (580).&lt;ref&gt;Devitt, Amy. "Generalizing about Genre: New Conceptions of an Old Concept." College Composition and Communication. 44.4 (1993): 573-586. Web. JSTOR. 22 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; To Devitt, genres not only respond to recurrent situations, but they construct them as well.&lt;ref&gt;Devitt, Amy. "Integrating Rhetorical and Literary Theories of Genre." College English. 62.6 (2000): 696-718.&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon makes theorizing genre evolution challenging.  [[Carolyn R. Miller]] even cautions against describing genre change as "evolution," as evolution implies progress.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Carolyn R. "Do Genres Evolve?" Genre 2012: Rethinking Genre 20 Years Later." Carleton University, Ottawa Canada. 27 Jun 2012. Keynote Address&lt;/ref&gt; Still, many RGS scholars have theorized how genres change. [[Jo Ann Yates]] and [[Wanda Orlikowski]] offer that "one person cannot single-handedly effect the change of an institutionalized structure; other relevant participants must adopt and reinforce the attempted change for it to be implemented and sustained in practice" (108).&lt;ref&gt;"Genre Systems: Chronos and Kairos in Communicative Action" The Rhetoric of Ideology and Ideology of Genre. Eds. Richard Coe, Lorelei Lingard, and Tatiana Teslenko. Cresskill, NJ, Hampton Press, 2002. 103-122.&lt;/ref&gt; Yates and Orlikowski then describe how genres evolve: they claim that genres change when a kairotic moment presents itself, and the rhetor, instead of choosing to employ the "genre most appropriately enacted" tries a new method of which the audience accepts as new way of responding to the recurrent situation (119). See [[kairos]]. [[Natasha Artemeva]] has made similar observations based on an eight-year ethnographic survey that followed engineering students from academia and into the workplace environment.&lt;ref&gt;Artemeva, Natasha. "Stories of Becoming: A Study of Novice Engineers Learning Genres of Their Profession." Genre in a Changing World. Eds. Charles Bazerman, Adair Bonini, and Débora Figueiredo.  West Lafayette, Indiana, Parlor Press, 2009. 158-178. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Artemeva observed two of her subjects impact the evolution of workplace genres when a kairotic moment presented itself (164).  Yet these former student's success in changing the workplace genre also depended on three individually acquired skills: 1) "cultural capital", 2) "domain content expertise", and 3) "agency in the rhetor's ability" to not only see when a kairotic moment presented itself, but "to also seize the opportunity" (167). [[Thomas Helscher]] is not as optimistic; he writes, the "rhetorical constitution of [a] discourse community operates as a counterweight to the process of community growth and change" (30) and argues that the "transformation of the fundamental generic conventions by which communities constitutes themselves...is paradigmatic of the process of social transformation" (32).&lt;ref&gt;Helscher, Thomas P. "The Subject of Genre." Genre and Writing: Issues, Arguments, Alternatives. Ed. Wendy Bishop and Hans Ostrom. Portsmouth, NH: Boynton/Cook 	Publishers, 1997. 27–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current state of genre theory==
The definition of genre from [http://www.dictionary.com dictionary.com] is "a class or category of artistic endeavor having a particular form, context, technique, or the like."  Although it seems that genre should be easy to define, the finer points of textual categorization are not yet established.

Genres, according to [[Daniel Chandler]], create order to simplify the mass of available information.  Creating categories promotes organization instead of chaos.  [[Jane Feuer]] has divided ways to categorize genres into three different groups.  The first is aesthetic.  By using this method one can organize according to certain sets of characteristics, and so the overall work of the artist is not disparaged by generalization.  The second classification method is [[ritual]].  Ritual uses its own culture to help classify.  If one performs a ritual associated with a system of ritual, one can be said to be practicing as a member of that system.  The common taxonomic method is [[ideology|ideological]].  This occurs most often in the marketing of texts, music, and movies.  The effectiveness of this type of categorization can be measured by how well the public accepts these categories as valid.

[[Amy J. Devitt]] focuses on the [[rhetoric]]al approach to genre.  Scholars generally recognize the restrictions  placed on works that have been classified as a certain genre.  However, viewing genre as a rhetorical device gives the author and the reader more freedom and "allows for choices."  Genres are not free-standing entities, but are actually intimately connected and interactive amongst themselves.  Rhetorical theory of genre recognizes that genres are generated by authors, readers, publishers, and the entire array of social forces that act upon a work at every stage of its production.

This recognition does not make the taxonomy of texts easy.  Chandler points out that very few works have all the characteristics of the genre in which they participate.  Also, due to the interrelatedness of genres, none of them is clearly defined at the edges, but rather fade into one another.  Genre works to promote organization, but there is no absolute way to classify works, and thus genre is still problematic and its theory still evolving.

Moreover, the metagenre as a concept has been an important point to study. According to Giltrow, metagenre is "situated language about situated language". Metagenres such as institutional guidelines can be "ruling out certain kinds of expression, endorsing others", constraining and enabling. The concept of metagenre also provides a valuable way to understand the dynamics of institutional interrelations between genres. In the mental health discourse, for example, has been demonstrated the metageneric function of the American Psychiatric Association's (DSM) for standardizing and mediating the localized epistemological communicative practices of psychiatrists.

==Functions and limits==

Genre began as an absolute classification system in ancient Greece. [[Poetry]], [[prose]] and [[performance]] had a specific and calculated style that related to the theme of the story. Speech patterns for comedy would not be appropriate for tragedy, and even actors were restricted to their genre under the assumption that a type of person could tell one type of story best. This classical system worked well as long as the arts were largely directed by nobility and rich patrons. A common understanding of meaning was handy in knowing what the employer expected, and the crowds understood it.

During the Enlightenment period in 18th century Europe, this system of [[patronage]] began to change.  A merchant [[middle class]] began to emerge with money to spend and time to spend it.  Artists could venture away from classical genres and try new ways to attract paying patrons. "Comedy" could now mean Greek metered comedy, or physical camp, or some other type of experience. Artists were also free to use their mediums to express the human condition in a way that was not possible under single patronage, or at least not profitable. Art could be used to reflect and comment on the lives of ordinary people. Genre became a dynamic tool to help the public make sense out of unpredictable art. Because art is often a response to a social state, in that people write/paint/sing/dance about what they know about, the use of genre as a tool must be able to adapt to changing meanings. In fact, as far back as ancient Greece, new art forms were emerging that called for the evolution of genre, for example the "tragicomedy."

Unfortunately, genre does have its limitations. Our world has grown so much that it is difficult to absolutely classify something. Information overlaps, and a single book can encompass elements of several genres. For example, a book might be classified as [[fiction]], [[Mystery fiction|mystery]], [[science fiction]] and [[African American literature]] all at once.
	 
Genre suffers from the same ills of any classification system. Humans are pattern-seeking beings; we like to create order out of the chaos of the universe. However, when we forget that our order is imposed, often arbitrarily, over a universe of unique experiences, the merit of the individual gets lost. If a system of classification, like genre, is then used to assign value judgments, we allow our preconceptions about the whole to influence our opinion of the individual. Genre is useful as long as we remember that it is a helpful tool, to be reassessed and scrutinized, and to weigh works on their unique merit as well as their place within the genre.

A simple example of the inherent meaning in an art form is that of a [[western movie]] where two men face each other on a dusty and empty road; one wears a black hat, the other white. Independent of any external meaning, there is no way to tell what the situation might mean, but due to the long development of the "western" genre, it is clear to the informed audience that they are watching a gunfight showdown between a [[villain|bad guy]] and a [[hero|good guy]].

It has been suggested that genres resonate with people because of the familiarity, the shorthand communication, as well as the tendency of genres to shift with public [[mores]] and to reflect the [[zeitgeist]]. While the genre of [[storytelling]] has been relegated as lesser form of art because of the heavily borrowed nature of the [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], admiration has grown. Proponents argue that the genius of an effective genre piece is in the variation, recombination, and evolution of the codes.

Genre studies have perhaps gained the most recognition in [[film theory]], where the study of genre directly contrasts with [[auteur theory]], which privileges the director's role in crafting a movie.

== In social communities ==
There is something more about genre theory, and to that effect it is necessary to propose Kristen H. Perry's definition. Written (textual) genres are social constructions that represent specific purposes for reading and writing within different social activities, created by social groups who need them to perform certain things. They change over time, reflecting essential shifts in social function performed by that text. Genres also represent constellations of textual attributes: some attributes are necessary and other attributes are optional.

Another definition which shows the different aspects of genre theory is Miller who defines genres as "typified rhetorical actions" that respond to recurring situations and become instantiated in groups' behaviors. Genre evolves as "a form of social knowledge—a mutual construing of objects, events, interests and purposes that not only links them but makes them what they are: an objectified social need". This view sees genres not as static forms but, rather, as "forms of  ways of being ... frames for social action ... environments for learning ... locations within which meaning is constructed" ([[Charles Bazerman|Bazerman]]), suggesting that different communities use different means of communication to accomplish their objectives.

To try to show the importance of the context in genre an example is used about a particular part of the genre theory—speech genres; but it is important to stress that context is really important in all situations. Context plays an important role in shaping genres (Holquist, 1986). Genre theory does not conceptualize context as simply the space outside of text or the container surrounding texts, but as dynamic environments that simultaneously structure and are structured by the communicative practices of social [[Structure and agency|agent]]s. Speech genres are recognizable patterns of language-in-context (Bakhtin, 1986): speech genres include both oral and written forms of language.

Researchers have also shown that the rhetorical moves people must make within accepted genres to communicate successfully in particular contexts operate to reinforce communities' identities and to legitimate particular communication practices. Thus, the genres that communities enact help structure their members' ways of creating, interpreting, and using knowledge (Myers; Winsor, Ordering, Writing; Bazerman, Shaping, Constructing; Berkenkotter and Huckin; Smart).
Genres are very important in our every day life and we do not realize how much we use them, how much they affect us, how much they determine the way we act and understand the others.

==Aspects of genre theory==

===Rhetorical situation===
[[File:James Matthew Barrie00.jpg|thumb|[[J. M. Barrie]]'s works were notoriously hard to place in any single genre.]]
In 1968, [[Lloyd Bitzer]] claimed that [[discourse]] is determined by rhetorical situations in his article titled, "The Rhetorical Situation". A rhetorical situation refers to the fact that every situation has the potential for a rhetorical response. He looks to understand the nature behind the context that determines discourse. Bitzer states, "it is the situation which calls discourse into existence".&lt;ref name=Bitzer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bitzer|first=Lloyd F.|title=The Rhetorical Situation|journal=Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric|date=Jan 1968|volume=1|issue=1|pages=2–4|doi=10.2307/40236733}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 May 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the situation controls what type of rhetorical response takes place. Each situation has an appropriate response in which the rhetor can either act upon or not act upon. He expresses the imperative nature of the situation in creating discourse, because discourse only comes into being as a response to a particular situation. Discourse varies depending upon the meaning-context that is created due to the situation, and because of this, it is "embedded in the situation".&lt;ref name=Bitzer /&gt;

According to Bitzer, rhetorical situations come into existence, at which point, they can either mature and go away, or mature and continue to exist. Bitzer describes rhetorical situations as containing three components: exigence, [[audience]], and constraints. He highlights six characteristics needed from a rhetorical situation that are necessary to creating discourse. A situation calls a rhetor to create discourse, it invites a response to fit the situation, the response meets the necessary requirements of the situation, the exigence which creates the discourse is located in reality, rhetorical situations exhibit simple or complex structures, rhetorical situations after coming into creation either decline or persist. Bitzer's main argument is the concept that rhetoric is used to "effect valuable changes in real" (Bitzer 14).

In 1984, Carolyn R. Miller examined genre in terms of rhetorical situations. She claimed that "situations are social constructs that are the result, not of 'perception,' but of 'definition'".&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Carolyn R.|title=Genre as Social Action|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|date=May 1984|volume=70|issue=2|pages=151–67|doi=10.1080/00335638409383686}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 May 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, we essentially define our situations. Miller seems to build from Bitzer's argument regarding what makes something rhetorical, which is the ability of change to occur. Opposite of Bitzer's predestined and limited view of the creation of genres, Miller believes genres are created through [[social constructs]]. She agreed with Bitzer that past responses can indicate what is an appropriate response to the current situation, but Miller holds that, rhetorically, genre should be "centered not on the substance or the form of discourse but on the action it is used to accomplish".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Since her view focuses on action, it cannot ignore that humans depend on the "context of the situation" as well as "motives" that drive them to this action.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Essentially, "we create recurrence," or similar responses, through our "construal" of types.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Miller defines "types" as "recognition of relevant similarities".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Types come about only after we have attempted to interpret the situation by way of social context, which causes us to stick to "tradition".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Miller does not want to deem recurrence as a constraint, but rather she views it as insight into the "human condition".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; The way to bring about a new "type",&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; is to allow for past routines to evolve into new routines, thereby maintaining a cycle that is always open for change. Either way, Miller's view is in accordance with the fact that as humans, we are creatures of habit that tightly hold on to a certain "stock of knowledge".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; However, change is considered innovation, and by creating new "types" we can still keep "tradition"&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; and innovation at the same time.

===Genre as social action===
The concept of genre is not limited to classifications and lists. People interact within genres daily. Genre is determined based "on the action it is used to accomplish" by the individuals using that particular genre.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; The distance between the text or action of genre and its users does not have to be vast. People respond to exigencies provided by genre every day. Exigence is "a set of particular social patterns and expectations that provides a socially objectified motive for addressing" the recurring situation of a particular genre.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Seeing genre as a social action provides the "keys to understanding how to participate in the actions of a [[community]]".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Carolyn R. Miller argues that, "a rhetorical sound definition of genre must be centered not on the substance or the form of discourse, but on the action it is used to accomplish".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;

The idea that rhetorical situations define genre means that participants in genre make decisions based on commonalities and repeat those instances. Genre is not only about the form of but also the mere repetitiveness of similarities. The classroom setting exemplifies this. When students wish to speak, they raise their hands to signify that desire. Raising a hand is the correct response to speaking in turn in that particular social setting. A person at lunch with a group of friends would not raise their hand to speak because the social situation is different. Miller concludes that social actions are the response to "understanding how to participate in the actions of a community".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;

Carolyn R. Miller builds on arguments made by other scholars while also contradicting Bitzer's argument by giving her readers five features to understand genre.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;  She believes that if something is rhetorical, then there will be action.  Not only will there be action, but this action will also be repeated.  The repetition of action creates a regularized form of discourse.  Miller would add that the result has more to do with the action accomplished by the situation.  Miller recognizes that a person chooses to take a certain social action within a defined set of rules - rules set in place by that user.  Lastly, a situation cannot dictate a response.  Miller ends her article with the thought that genres are partly rhetorical education through her statement, "as a recurrent, significant action, a genre embodies an aspect of cultural rationality".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;  Here, Miller unknowingly encapsulates a future ideology about genre: that genres are created by [[culture]].
According to Mnotho Dlamini genre is basically a deep information in a particular context.

===Social construct===&lt;!--romance and comedy are genres.--&gt;
Bitzer's definition of exigence as "an imperfection marked by urgency... something waiting to be done"&lt;ref name=Bitzer /&gt;  ties in with Miller's idea of social action as the next step after an exigency is realized. Miller also points towards the theory that genres recur, based on Jamieson's observation that antecedent genres finding their way into new genres. More importantly, Miller takes on the bigger picture of a rhetorical situation in which all of these steps happen. "Situations are social constructs that are the result, not of 'perception,' but of definition".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; From this, it is understood that social constructs define situations and, therefore, exigence is also socially situated.

Genre, also, understood in terms of social contexts provides greater meaning to each recurring situation; it essentially allows for differentiation, though past genres have a role in present and new genres. Through this differentiation, genre is allowed to continue evolving, just as social contexts continue to change with time. Bawarshi describes the way in which this happens as "communicants and their social environments are constantly in the process of reproducing one another" (Bawarshi 69). Rhetoric essentially works the same way, as seen in the example of writing Bawarshi provides, "writing is not a social act simply because it takes place in some social context; it is social because it is at work in shaping the very context within which it functions".&lt;ref name="Reif. p.70"&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.70&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, through social constructs, one can shape rhetorical works, and in turn, the works can shape the social context: "we create our contexts as we create our texts".&lt;ref name="Reif. p.70"/&gt;

===Antecedent genres===
Written in 1975, [[Kathleen Hall Jamieson]]'s "Antecedent Genre as Rhetorical Constraint" declares that discourse is determined by the [[Rhetorical Situation]], as well as antecedent genres. Antecedent genres are genres of the past that are used as a basis to shape and form current rhetorical responses. When placed in an unprecedented situation, a rhetor can draw on antecedent genres of similar situations in order to guide their response. However, caution should be taken when drawing on antecedent genres because sometimes antecedent genres are capable of imposing powerful constraints.&lt;ref name=Jamieson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jamieson|first=Kathleen Hall|title=Antecedent Genre as Rhetorical Constraint|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|date=Dec 1975|volume=61|issue=4|page=414|doi=10.1080/00335637509383303}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 May 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The intent of antecedent genres are to guide the rhetor toward a response consistent with situational demands, and if the situational demands are not the same as when the antecedent genre was created, the response to the situation might be inappropriate.&lt;ref name=Jamieson /&gt;

Through three examples of discourse, the papal [[encyclical]], the early [[State of the Union Address]], and congressional replies, she demonstrates how traces of antecedent genres can be found within each. These examples clarify how a rhetor will tend to draw from past experiences that are similar to the present situation in order to guide them how to act or respond when they are placed in an unprecedented situation. Jamieson explains, by use of these three examples, that choices of antecedent genre may not always be appropriate to the present situation. She discusses how antecedent genres place powerful constraints on the rhetor and may cause them to become "bound by the [[manacles]] of the antecedent genre".&lt;ref name=Jamieson /&gt; These "manacles," she says, may range in level of difficultly to escape. Jamieson urges one to be careful when drawing on the past to respond to the present, because of the consequences that may follow ones choice of antecedent genre. She reiterates the intended outcome through her statement of "choice of an appropriate antecedent genre guides the rhetor toward a response consonant with situational demands".&lt;ref name=Jamieson /&gt;

===Reciprocity of genre===
People often recognize genre based on the characteristics that the situation offers. Amy Devitt states this when she says, "A genre is named because of its formal markers" (Devitt 10). However she also says, "the formal markers can be defined because a genre has been named" (Devitt 10). When we label something as a certain genre, we also flag these same characteristics as contributing to what we already believe the genre to be.  These two quotes show how reciprocity functions within genre. Devitt displays the reciprocal nature of genre and situation according to the individual by using an example of a grocery store list. A question posed by this example is, is something a grocery list because it lists groceries or is it a grocery list because one person says it is a grocery list and we thus recognize all the items on the list as groceries? Though each possible answer to this raised question contradict one another, they are both correct. Similarly, individuals recognize the characteristics of the recurring rhetorical situations in the same way as they see them as affirmation of what they already know about the preexisting genre. The rhetorical attributes of the genre act as both objects which define and are defined by genre. In other words, genre and rhetorical situations are reciprocals of one another. Devitt focused on activity system of genre and that the participants' situation, contexts and text are all mutually created "no one aspect fully determines the other." (Devitt)

===Tyranny of genre===
The phrase "tyranny of genre" comes from genre theorist [[Richard Coe]], who wrote that "the 'tyranny of genre' is normally taken to signify how generic structures constrain individual creativity" (Coe 188). If genre functions as a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] classification system, it could constrain individual creativity, since "the presence of many of the conventional features of a genre will allow a strong genre identification; the presence of fewer features, or the presence of features of other genres, will result in a weak or ambiguous genre identification" (Schauber 403).

Genres can act as constraints on readers as well.  Literary historian [[Hans Robert Jauss]] describes genres as creating a "[[horizon of expectation]]" under which readers will interpret texts based on how much they correspond to the features of the genre they recognize from works they have previously read.&lt;ref name=Jauss&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jauss|first=Hans Robert|author2=Benzinger, Elizabeth|title=Literary History as a Challenge to Literary Theory|journal=New Literary History|date=Autumn 1970|volume=2|issue=1|page=13|doi=10.2307/468585}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 May 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The classification-system concept results in a polarization of responses to texts that do not fit neatly into a genre or exhibit features of multiple genres: "The status of genres as discursive institutions does create constraints that may make a text that combines or mixes genres appear to be a cultural monstrosity. Such a text may be attacked or even made a scapegoat by some as well as be defended by others" ([[Dominick LaCapra|LaCapra]] 220).

Under the more modern understanding of the concept of genre as "[[Genre#Genre as social action|social action]]" à la Miller,&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; a more situational approach to genre is enabled. This situational approach frees genre from the classification system, genre's "tyranny of genre". Relying on the importance of the [[Genre#Rhetorical situation|rhetorical situation]] in the concept of genre results in an exponential expansion of genre study, which benefits literary analysis. One literature professor writes, "The use of the contemporary, revised genre idea [as social action] is a breath of fresh air, and it has opened important doors in language and literature pedagogy" (Bleich 130). Instead of a codified classification as the pragmatic application of genre, the [[Genre#Genre as social action|new genre idea]] insists that "human agents not only have the creative capacities to reproduce past action, such as action embedded in genres, but also can respond to changes in their environment, and in turn change that environment, to produce under-determined and possibly unprecedented action, such as by modifying genres" (Killoran 72).

===Stabilization, homogenization and fixity===
Never is there total stabilization in a recognized genre, nor are there instances that indicate a complete lack of homogenization. However, because of the relative similarities between the terms "stabilization" and "homogenization", the amount of stabilization or homogenization a certain genre maintains is based on opinion. Necessary discourse is, obviously, always needed and is thus considered perfectly stabilized. In rhetorical situation or antecedent genres, that which is unprecedented mostly leads to stable and predictable responses. Outside the natural setting of a given form of discourse, one may respond inappropriately due to an unrecognized alternate. The unrecognized alternate is created by the lack of homogenization or differing expectations in the presented rhetorical situation.&lt;ref name=Jamieson /&gt;

Fixity is uncontrolled by a given situation and is deliberately utilized by the affected before the rhetorical situation occurs. Fixity almost always directly effects stabilization, and has little to no bearing on homogenization. The choice of discourse will provide a certain value of fixity, depending on the specific choice. If a situation calls for more mediated responses, the fixity of the situation is more prevalent, and therefore is attributed with a stable demand of expectations. Stability nor fixity can be directly affected by the subject at hand. The only option is affecting homogenization which in turn, can positively or negatively affect stability. Directly choosing a fixed arena within genre inversely alters the homogenization of said chooser constituting as a new genre accompanied with modified genre subsets and a newly desired urgency. The same ideological theory can be applied to how one serves different purposes, creating either separate genres or modernized micro-genres. (Fairclough)

===Genre ecology and activity theory===
{{main article|Activity theory}}
Activity theory is not grounded in any one area of field of research, but instead draws from several disciplines including psychology, behaviorism, and socio-cultural studies. Although activity theory originated in the social sciences, it is currently applied most frequently to social-scientific, organizational, and writing studies. Modeled as a triangle, activity theory considers how multiple factors (subject, object, mediating artifacts, rules, and division of labor) existing in an activity system (environment) interact to achieve an outcome. Central to activity theory is the concept of mediation. Human activities are driven by a need to achieve a certain outcome or goal. Typically this activity is mediated by artifacts which include tools, language, signs, and cultural norms. In "Textual Objects" Cheryl Geisler explains that texts are traditionally identified as meditational means to complete a task, though she offers that texts might also be identified as the motive in discourse communities in which text is valued as the outcome as opposed to the means of an outcome. Geisler notes that texts produced for meditational means are typically more private/personalized, whereas texts identified as objects are often written with a public motive. She does not argue, however, that texts should exist exclusively as one or the other, but rather she suggests that texts can function as both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geisler|first=Cheryl|title=Textual Objects: Accounting for the Role of Texts in the Everyday Life of Complex Organizations|journal=Written Communication|year=2001|volume=18|issue=1|pages=296–325|doi=10.1177/0741088301018003003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some genre theorists, such as Clay Spinuzzi, genres are tools-in-use, and as such can be seen as mediating objects within the world. This view of genre as a tool-in-use is exemplified in the school of genre theory that studies genres' relationships to activity systems.&lt;ref&gt;Costa, C. J., Antunes, P., &amp; Dias, J. F. (2002). Integrating two organizational Systems through communication genres (pp. 125–132). Presented at the International Conference on Coordination Languages and Models, Springer Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt; In his article "Textual Grounding: How People Turn Texts into Tools," Jason Swarts asserts that users utilize texts as tools when they recognize the text's specific value in a rhetorical situation or environment. User's then "ground" texts, altering the texts structure for personal use, to make them usable under very specific conditions. The user takes the text from a "formalized representation of information" to a personal tool. Swarts argues that the meaning of a text is established by uptake of the users, though this varies depending on the user and the user's goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swarts|first=Jason|title=Textual Grounding:How People Turn Texts Into Tools|journal=Journal of Technical Writing and Communication|year=2004|volume=34|issue=1|pages=67–89|doi=10.2190/eg0c-quey-f9fk-2v0d}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in ''Tracing Genres Through Organizations: A Sociocultural Approach to Information Design'', Clay Spinuzzi asserts that the use of certain tools in certain situations can help users to act purposefully in that activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spinuzzi|first=Clay|title=Tracing Genres Through Organizations: A Sociocultural Approach to Information Design|year=2003|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this tradition of genre studies, "Genres are not discrete artifacts, but traditions of producing, using, and interpreting artifacts, traditions that make their way into the artifact as a form-shaping ideology."&lt;ref&gt;Morson, G.S. and C. Emerson.''Mikhail Bakhtin:Creation of a Prosaics''. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1990. p.282-284.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of genres as mediating artifacts within activity systems is closely related to [[Activity Theory]], in which the interactions of different spheres of activity are examined. Activity theory, according to David Russell, "traces cognition and behavior, including writing, to social interaction."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, David R. "Rethinking Genre in School and Society: An Activity Theory Analysis." ''Written Communication'' (October 1997). p.509.&lt;/ref&gt; Activity theorists examine the ways that the work done in one sphere of activity could potentially change the work done in another. For example, Russell examines how people use writing to mediate their activities, and how changes in one activity can lead to changes in another activity. Russell points out that "the activity system of cell biology research is not confined to universities. It also extends into boundary activity systems of drug companies, government medical research facilities, and so on."&lt;ref&gt;Russell. "Rethinking Genre." p.527.&lt;/ref&gt; Subtle changes in the use of writing in one activity can effect changes in the use of writing in related systems. If the government sets down new pharmaceutical documentation laws, then the teaching of how to document the distribution of pharmaceuticals will change, not just in pharmacies, but also in hospitals and nursing classrooms. Activity systems are always in flux, because subtle changes in one level of the system result in subtle changes in other levels of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Spinuzzi. ''Tracing Genres''. p.50&lt;/ref&gt; Activity systems are still relatively stable, despite their constant flux. The changes within them are often subtle, and large scale changes usually occur over long periods of time.

'''Genre ecology''' describes the dense connections between genres within the activities that they mediate. Multiple genres mediate a single activity; no genre exists in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;Spinuzzi, Clay and M. Zachry. "Genre Ecologies: An open-system approach to understanding and constructing documentation." ''Journal of Computer Documentation'' 24.3 (2000). p:172.&lt;/ref&gt; In "The Ecology of Genre" Anis Bawarshi argues that genres are "rhetorical ecosystems" in which participants actively enact and, consequently, reenact social practices, relations, and identities. Participants use genre to interpret and perform social motives which sustain rhetorical ecosystems that produce social contexts, practices, and identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weisser|first=Christian|title=Ecocomposition:Theoretical and Pedagogical Approaches|year=2001|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Spinuzzi, and other genre theorists studying the social aspects of genre (like Carolyn R. Miller, Amy Devitt, and Kathleen Jamieson, among others), genre is more than a category or artifact; genre is a way of interacting with the world. In the study of genre ecologies, genre is seen as a way people can accomplish activities.&lt;ref&gt;Spinuzzi. ''Tracing Genres''. p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Like activity systems, genre ecologies are not entirely stable, because activities change, causing the genres mediating them to change, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Spinuzzi. ''Tracing Genres''. p.65&lt;/ref&gt; Take, for example the digitization of the workplace. Before computers, the workspace was largely mediated by genres such as the paper memo,or the company newsletter. After digitization, paper memos and paper newsletters began to disappear. Memos and newsletters did not disappear; instead, their distribution method changed. Now, memos and newsletters are disseminated electronically in emails. The genres of the memo and newsletter still exists, but they have changed, slightly, to reflect the changes in the activity system that they mediate.

===Secondary speech genres===
Mikhail Bakhtin's theorization of complex, secondary speech genres as composites of simple, primary speech genres in the analysis of the interaction between the multiple competing voices and registers in literary works. Bakhtin defines complex, secondary speech genres as "novels, dramas, all kinds of scientific research, major genres of commentary, and so forth [that] arise in more complex and comparatively highly developed and organized cultural communication" (62). While Bakhtin focuses on the historical emergence of the novel in much of his work, in his essay "The Problem of Speech Genres," he makes clear that his theory can be applied to all literary genres, including "profoundly individual lyrical work[s]" (61) such as the pastoral elegy. Complex, secondary speech genres are formed by "absorb[ing] and digest[ing] various primary (simple) genres that have taken form in unmediated speech communion" (62). Primary speech genres are "short rejoinders of daily dialogue," "everyday narration," "brief standard military command" (60), "verbal signals in industry" (63), "letters, diaries, minutes, and so forth" (98), notable for their referentiality to and function within the pragmatic communicative contexts of "extraverbal reality (situation)" (83). When primary speech genres are absorbed by secondary ones, they are "altered and assume a special character," losing "their immediate relation to actual reality and to the real utterances of others" (62). This process of absorption and digestion of primary speech genres by secondary ones leads to a "more or less distinct dialogization of secondary genres, the weakening of their monological composition" (66). While Bakhtinian dialogization may weaken the monological composition of secondary speech genres, it does not preclude a dominant theme, ideology, or cultural meaning from arising out of interplay of the "various transformed primary genres" (98) that make up a secondary work (although, Bakhtin admits, this dominant ideology is difficult to isolate in complex works, and is, to a certain extent, left open to the interpretation of individual readers). Bakhtin explains that primary genres undergo a more or less thorough process of contestation and resolution within the secondary work they constitute and "enter into actual reality only via the [work] as a whole, that is, as a literary-artistic event and not as everyday life" (62). "As a rule, these secondary genres of complex cultural communication play out various forms of primary speech communication" (Bakhtin 98). Even as a work permits and enacts dialogization between characters, conventional forms, and semantic content, it resolves or "finalizes" that content into a "wholeness" of utterance, which is intelligible to readers, and therefore "guarantee[s] the possibility of response (or of responsive understanding)" (76). Through the finalization of disparate conventional and thematic strands, a work achieves the fullness of what Bakhtin calls its "specific authorial intent," Milton's "speech plan" or "speech will" for his work, and readies itself for responsive understanding (reception, interpretation) on the part of readers (77). Despite its internal dialogization, the work delivers itself to readers as a semantically exhaustive whole, and in this way uses its internal drama to respond ideologically to its genre: "other works connected with it in the overall processes of speech communication in [its] particular cultural sphere" (75). These include "works of predecessors on whom the author relies," "other works of the same school," and "works of opposing schools with which the author is contending" (75). In this way the work forms a crucial "link the chain of speech communion" of its genre (76).&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, Mikhail M. "The Problem of Speech Genres." ''Speech Genres and Other Late Essays''. Eds. Caryl Emerson and Michael Holquist. Austin, TX: U of Texas P, 1986. 60-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''God Speed''''' is a painting by British artist [[Edmund Leighton]], depicting an armored knight departing to war and leaving his beloved. The painting was exhibited in the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1900.&lt;ref name="Sotheby's"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2012/british-irish-art/lot.26.html| title =Lot 26 |publisher =[[Sotheby's]]| accessdate = 28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''God Speed'' was the first of several paintings by Leighton in the 1900s on the subject of [[chivalry]], the others being ''[[The Accolade (painting)|The Accolade]]'' (1901) and ''The Dedication'' (1908).

==Composition==
The woman ties a red sash around the knight's arm, which he is meant to return, a medieval custom which assured both parties that they would be reunited, alive and well.&lt;ref name="tet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/arts-entertainment/reading-art-blair-leightons-god-speed-279518.html |title=Reading Art: Blair Leighton’s ‘God Speed’ |publisher=[[The Epoch Times]] |author=Wim Van Aalst |date=August 2012 |accessdate=27 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808044844/http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/arts-entertainment/reading-art-blair-leightons-god-speed-279518.html |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[griffin]] on the [[Newel|newel post]] of the stairs is a symbol of strength and military courage.&lt;ref name="tet"/&gt; The knight departs through a castle gate with [[portcullis]]; others can be seen leaving through the gate.

When the painting was ready for transportation to the Royal Academy, Leighton made a last-moment change in the studio.&lt;ref name="artmag"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.artmagick.com/articles/article.aspx?id=11813|title=The Art of Mr. E.

==Provenance==
After being bought from Leighton, the painting was owned by several people and in 1988 appeared at [[Christie's]].&lt;ref name="Sotheby's"/&gt; It was then housed in an American private collection and in 2000 was again submitted to Christie's.&lt;ref name="Sotheby's"/&gt; In 2007 the painting appeared at [[Sotheby's]] and then in a British private collection.&lt;ref name="Sotheby's"/&gt; On 10 May 2012 ''God Speed'' was sold again to a private collector through Sotheby's in London.&lt;ref name="Sotheby's"/&gt;

'''''Hercules' Dog Discovers Purple Dye''''' or '''''The Discovery of Purple by Hercules' Dog''''' is an oil painting by [[Flemish]] artist [[Peter Paul Rubens]] painted circa 1636, towards the end of his career.  It depicts the mythical discovery of [[Tyrian purple]] by [[Hercules]] and his dog, and was one of dozens of oil on panel sketches made by Rubens for the decoration of the [[Torre de la Parada]] in Spain.  A completed painting based on Rubens' sketch was made by [[Theodoor van Thulden]] in 1636-8, and is now held by the [[Prado Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/el-descubrimiento-de-la-purpura/57d12ff8-e9f2-4703-94e6-6e182b539df9 Prado] (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - La découverte de la pourpre - detail.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Detail showing the dog with what appears to be a [[nautilus]] rather than a [[Bolinus brandaris|dye murex]]]]
The painting shows a scene from an [[origin myth]] in the ''[[wikt:Onomasticon|Onomasticon]]''  (a collection of names, similar to a [[thesaurus]]) of  [[Julius Pollux]], a 2nd-century Graeco-Roman sophist. In Pollux's story, [[Hercules]] and his dog were walking on the beach on their way to court a nymph named [[Tyro]]. The dog bit a [[sea snail]], and the snail's blood dyed the dog's mouth [[Tyrian purple]]. Seeing this, the nymph demanded a gown of the same color, and the result was the origin of purple dye.&lt;ref name=silver/&gt;&lt;ref name=snoeck/&gt;&lt;ref name=kress/&gt;  (Some ancient sources attribute the myth to [[Melqart]], a [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] deity identified with Heracles.)

Rubens' painting of this story depicts Hercules and the dog on the beach, with the dog's mouth stained.&lt;ref name=silver/&gt;&lt;ref name=snoeck&gt;{{citation|title=Rubens|year=2004|publisher=Snoeck|page=170}}.

==Context==
Rubens' painting was originally part of a cycle of paintings of Hercules, which Rubens painted for the [[Habsburg]] rulers of Spain as sketch for a painting intended to decorate their [[Torre de la Parada]], a hunting lodge. The paintings of the cycle contain allegorical references to the Habsburgs and the wealth they had obtained from the conquest of [[Peru]].&lt;ref name=silver/&gt;

The "royal purple" whose origin story this particular painting depicts was used to clothe emperors, and by the time of Rubens it had become a standard aspect of the depiction of royalty and divinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Routledge Companion to Medieval Iconography|first=Colum|last=Hourihane|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2016|isbn=9781315298368|page=442|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nT4lDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA442}}&lt;/ref&gt; By showing a scene of Hercules' travels to Phoenicia, the painting also refers to a traditional warning, attributed to the Phoenicians, to stay within the bounds of the [[Pillars of Hercules]], and to the [[plus ultra|Habsburgs' own passage beyond that limit]].&lt;ref name=silver&gt;{{citation|title=Rubens, Velázquez, and the King of Spain|first=Larry|last=Silver|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781351550390|pages=106–107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TMrDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iroquois Park''' is a 739-acre (3.0&amp;nbsp;km²) municipal [[park]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]], [[United States]]. It was designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], who also designed Louisville's [[Cherokee Park]] and [[Shawnee Park]], at what were then the edges of the city. Located south of downtown, Iroquois Park was promoted as "Louisville's [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]]". It is built on a large knob covered with [[old growth forest]], and its most prominent feature are the scenic viewpoints atop the hill.

The summit of Iroquois Park presents an all-at-once vista of the city of Louisville, seen from the south. A bronze plaque at the site demonstrates the plan of the city's park and parkway system as planned and executed by Olmsted's firm.

The park features an [[amphitheatre|amphitheater]], [[basketball]] courts, 18-hole [[golf course]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://louisvilleky.gov/content/iroquois-golf-course|title=Iroquois Golf Course|work=louisvilleky.gov|accessdate=February 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[disc golf]] course and a riding stable. Louisville Metro Parks and partner companies stage concerts, musicals, and other shows each summer at '''Iroquois Amphitheater'''.

==History==
Iroquois Park was one of the three major suburban parks created in the late 19th century in Louisville. In 1889, Mayor [[Charles Donald Jacob]] purchased '''Burnt Knob''', a 313-acre (1.3&amp;nbsp;km²) tract of land 4 miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) south of the city, for $9,000, and was reimbursed by the city treasurer without approval from the city council or public referendum, meaning the original purchase was probably illegal. Jacob also negotiated with landowners between the city and the then-rural park to acquire the right of way for a 150-foot (46 m) wide "Grand Boulevard", today's [[Southern Parkway (Louisville, Kentucky)|Southern Parkway]], which still leads to the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Louisville's Olmsteadian Legacy|date=1988|last=Kramer|first=Carl|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The move was controversial at first and called "'''Jacob's Folly'''" by political opponents after early improvements were washed away by rain in the Spring of 1889. In 1890 control over the park, then called '''Jacob's&amp;nbsp;Park''', was given to the Board of Park Commissioners. Frederick Law Olmsted was invited to tour the park, and gave an influential speech at the [[Pendennis Club]] on May 20, 1891, and signed a contract to design the city's park system two days later. Work was soon underway on the park, by then renamed Iroquois, which Olmsted envisioned as "providing the grandeur of the forest depths in the dim seclusion of which you may wander musingly for hours".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Louisville's Olmsteadian Legacy|date=1988|last=Kramer|first=Carl|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Israeli ceramics''' are ceramics designed either in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] or [[Israel]] from the beginning of the 20th century. In additional to traditional [[pottery]], in Israel there are artists whose works were created in an industrial environment. Until the late 1970s there existed in Israel a local tradition that emphasized the local values of nature as an expression of [[Zionist]] identity. From the 1980s artistic expressions that sought to undercut this tradition began to appear in the works of Israeli artists, who combined ceramics with other artistic media and with personal, critical agendas.

==Beginning of ceramics in the Land of Israel, 1900–1930==
[[File:(Women) making clay jars, Ramallah, Palestine.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Arab women making clay jars, [[Ramallah]]]]

===Palestinian ceramics===
At the beginning of the 20th century the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] tradition of designing pottery from local materials dominated in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, ''The Beginnings of Israeli Ceramics, 1932-1962'', Ceramic Artists Association of Israel. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The pottery was primary functional, intended primarily for the use of the local population in the Land of Israel. Other vessels were imported from neighboring areas.

Pots were thrown on potter's wheels mostly in urban areas or in pottery villages. It was a craft traditionally worked by men.  In the census carried out on the streets of the land of Israel in 1928 during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]], 77 pottery villages (of individuals or groups) were listed, while in the 1931 census, 211 different pottery villages were listed.&lt;ref&gt;See: Ziffer, Irit, "Water Vessels in Traditional Arab Pottery," in To the ''Fountain: The Maiden and the Jar: A Local and Multi-Cultural Image'', Kenaan-Kedar, Nurith (Curator) (Tel Aviv: Eretz Israel Museum, 2013), 60. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the pottery villages were centralized, based on geographical proximity of the potters' families. Examples of this can be found in the pottery workshops held in the pottery villages in Rashia al Fakhar ([[Tel Faher]]) at the foot of [[Mount Hermon]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Feldman,Nir, ''Material From the Wind: Chava Samuel, a Pioneer of Ceramic Art in Israel'' (Rishon LeZion: Rishon LeZion Museum, 2011), 11. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Or in [[Hebron]], at the various workshops of the Alfahori family. These pots were fired at a low temperature in traditional kilns that burned wood, charcoal, or animal droppings. Different workshops were held in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] as well, where they produced unique black pottery (فخار اسود), produced by adding organic materials, such as barley husks, to the kiln or by reduction firing. The smoke from the process of the burning of these materials within the kiln lent the pottery its characteristic black color.&lt;ref&gt;See: Ziffer, Irit, "Water Vessels in Traditional Arab Pottery," in ''To the Fountain: The Maiden and the Jar: A Local and Multi-Cultural Image'', Kenaan-Kedar, Nurith(Curator) (Tel Aviv: Eretz Israel Museum, 2013), 47-48 [in Hebrew], and: Ziffer, Irit ,"A  Healthy Foundation for the Creations of the Younger Generation – A Note on Israeli Pottery Tradition,"  in ''The Third Biennale of Israeli Ceramics'' (Exhibition catalogue, Mark Tsatsula, ed.), Tel Aviv: Eretz Israel Museum, 2005), 110. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a tradition existed of producing pots made of clay mixed with straw or gravel for cooking and other utilitarian uses by the local population.  This work was carried out by hand by women, and the pots were fired in improvised kilns, in kitchen ovens, or sometimes not fired at all.  Pottery of this type, which was produced in the Samaria area and in [[Ramallah]], for example, was typically decorated with color made from rusted iron that originated in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Irit Ziffer, "A Healthy Foundation for the Creations of the Younger Generation – A Note on Israeli Pottery Tradition," in ''The Third Biennale of Israeli Ceramics'' (Exhibition catalogue, Mark Tsatsula, ed.), Tel Aviv: Eretz Israel Museum, 2005), 110. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the century progressed, this tradition began dying out as a result of industrialization, and in addition, from the 1980s competing pottery from other countries began to be imported.&lt;ref&gt;See: Shlomit Bauman, "Detachment and Continuity as an Influence on Creative Processes in Israeli Ceramic Design," ''History and Theory'', Bezalel II/16 – Creation Modes: Jewelry and Fashion, April 2010. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1989, for example, 11 different workshops were active in Hebron. However, by 2007 there remained only 8 potters there.&lt;ref&gt;Irit Ziffer, "Water Vessels in Traditional Arab Pottery," in ''To the Fountain: The Maiden and the Jar: A Local and Multi-Cultural Image'', Nurith  Kenaan-Kedar  (Curator) (Tel Aviv: Eretz Israel Museum, 2013), 60. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1983 [[The Eretz Israel Museum]] mounted an exhibition displaying the pottery of the Lebanese village of Rashia al Fakhar.&lt;ref&gt;"Exhibitions," Davar (30 December 1983). [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armenian ceramic art===
[[File:Armenian Room P1130760.JPG|thumb|right|250 px|Armenian Ceramics at the Jerusalem House of Quality ([[Saint John Eye Hospital Group]]), Jerusalem]]

In 1919 the British Mandate government invited a group of [[Armenians|Armenian]] potters, survivors of the Armenian Genocide, to repair the ceramic tiles of the [[Dome of the Rock]].  This experiment indicated the British interest in traditional art of the Arts and Crafts movement. Armenian ceramic art can be traced back to the 15th century, to the Turkish cities of [[İznik]] and [[Kütahya]], but the combination of the ancient art of the Land of Israel and Christian motifs created a unique artistic synthesis.

The outstanding artist of the early years was [[David Ohannessian]], who specialized in the design of ceramic decorative art in buildings and monuments, many of which were commissioned by the British Mandate government. The workshop that he founded – "The Dome of the Rock Tiles" – produced not only monumental works, but also utilitarian and decorative pottery. Among the most important works Ohannessian produced in Jerusalem were tiles for the [[American Colony Hotel]] (1923), the fountain house in St. John's Hospital, the tiled dome in the [[Rockefeller Museum]] garden, etc. Among the motifs that appear in his decorations are the [[Cypress]]es trees, [[tulip]]s, and grapevines typical of traditional Seljuk and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] decorative art.&lt;ref&gt;See: Nurith  Kenaan-Kedar, ''The Armenian Ceramics of Jerusalem'' (Jerusalem: Yad Izhak Ben-Zvi, 2002), 29-52.  [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Ohannessian introduced some unique Jerusalem iconography to his works, figures derived from Armenian medieval illuminations, historic designs and forms from European renaissance majolica, and bird motifs drawn from an Armenian Jerusalem 5th-6th century mosaic floor, discovered during an archeological dig in the Holy City during the 1890s, to name a few.

The workshop that Ohannessian founded in Jerusalem followed the tradition of ceramic making as he had practiced and overseen it in his atelier in Kutahya, in Ottoman Anatolia, which had flourished prior to World War I and his deportation to the Syrian desert. According to traditional methods, the processes of clay and glaze mixing, wheel throwing, design, painting, and firing were performed by a variety of artisans, all supervised by Ohannessian, some of whom specialized in design and others who were experts at the potter's wheel. Ohannessian was skilled himself in all facets of the art and trained a variety of apprentices, as he had done in Anatolia. He maintained particular expertise in painting ceramics and design. Upon the founding of his workshop on the Via Dolorosa, he cooperated with [[Near East Relief]], to train a number of Armenian orphans of the genocide, giving them the skills to engage in the art on a professional basis. Some of his workshop's output, especially the monumental architectural tile works, were signed by the chief artist. Numerous other vases and plates identified their respective makers through small glazed initials on the bottom, usually painted in ochre. Ohannessian's workshop used a stone wood-burning kiln, built to his specifications in 1919.  The model implemented in this workshop was used for other Armenian workshops founded subsequently in Jerusalem.

The artists [[Megardish Karakashian]] and [[Nishan Balian]], who left Ohannessian's workshop in 1922, founded a workshop together called "Palestine Pottery," where they developed a line of design with figurative images that were alien to traditional Turkish ceramic art.  For example, the two of them combined designs from ancient mosaics discovered in the Land of Israel, such as the "Birds Mosaic" (Jerusalem) or the mosaic from [[Hisham's Palace]] in [[Jericho]]. Often these images were imbued with Christian  theological interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;See: Nurith Kenaan-Kedar, ''The Armenian Ceramics of Jerusalem'' (Jerusalem: Yad Izhak Ben-Zvi, 2002), 53-91. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The joint workshop functioned continually until 1964, when Stefan Karakashian&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Stern, "Beit Hayotzer at Netiv Hayisurim," ''Al Hamishmar'', (18 August 1967). [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; and Marie Balian, heirs of the founders, founded two separate workshops that made use of images from the past as well as new images that they created.

===The ceramics of Bezalel===

Within the framework of the "[[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design|Beazlel School of Art and Craft]]", a ceramics studio was founded in 1924, with [[Jacob Eisenberg]] at its head.&lt;ref&gt;Nurit Shilo-Cohen, ''Schatz's "Bezalel," 1906-1929'' (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 1980), 364.  [in Hebrew]  These were the last years (1920-1929) of the institution that saw itself during this period less and less as an academy of art, and more and more as a series of partially independent art workshops.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1917 [[Boris Schatz]] was considering opening a department for the design of cast decorative items, as well as a department of painting on "porcelain."  This craft was already being taught at Bezalel using ready-made porcelain brought in from outside Palestine for use at Bezalel.&lt;ref&gt;See: Boris Schatz, "How to Encourage and Promote Home Crafts in Jerusalem and in Eretz Israel in General," printed in: ''Bezalel: 1906-1929'', ed. Nurit Shilo-Cohen (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 1980), 149-186, especially 173-175, and also: Bezalel 100, Book 1, ed. David Tartakover and Gideon Ofrat (Jerusalem: Hapais Council for the Culture and Arts, 2006), 174. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Schatz saw in the activity of the factory for bricks and roofing tiles that operated on the grounds of the "[[Schneller Orphanage]]" in Jerusalem from approximately 1895, proof of the practicality of such a local industry, which would make use of local materials brought from [[Motza]].

Eisenberg, who was a student at Bezalel from 1913 to 1919, after his graduation went to study in [[Vienna]], at the School for Arts and Crafts, where he took a continuing education course in ceramic design and production.&lt;ref&gt;Many of Bezalel's pupils, such as [[Nachum Gutman]], [[Israel Hirschfeld]], and others, went to [[Vienna]] for training.&lt;/ref&gt; The department separated the design of the ceramics, mostly taught by Bezalel instructors and particularly by [[Ze'ev Raban]], from the practical production of the pieces.  Of the objects produced in this department, the best known are the wall tiles and decorations from the 1920s and 1930s. These works include the tiles on the walls of the Ahad HaAm School, the [[Bialik House]], and the Lederberg House in Tel Aviv, and in the synagogue of Moshav Zekanim.

The style of tile design was influenced by Art [[Art Nouveau]] and by the "[[Jugendstil]] style.  This style is expressed in the flatness of the area described and in the richly decorated borders.  With regard to ideas, "Bezalel tiles" expressed a tendency toward transcendentalism, seen in their borders cast with images taken from [[Jewish]] tradition and [[Zionism|Zionist]] content.&lt;ref&gt;See: Alec Mishory, ""Zionist Resurrection on the Facade of 'The Municipal School' in Tel-Aviv," in ''Lo and Behold'' (Tel Aviv, Am Oved, 2000), 94-116. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning of Hebrew ceramics, 1932–1950==
[[File:Mira libes and hava samuel next to the kiln.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|[[Mira libes]] (left) and [[Chava Samuel]] (right) next to the kiln, [[Rishon LeZion]]]]
In her article "Techno Tools: The Logical Ones" (2011),&lt;ref&gt;Shlomit Bauman, "Ceramic design: Techno.logical Implements," ''Sixth Biennale of Israeli Ceramics'' (Tel Aviv: Eretz Israel Museum, 2011). [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shlomit Bauman]] maintained that contemporary Israeli ceramics is characterized by a disconnect from the Palestinian tradition and by "a lack of a local ceramics industry that would permit a dialog of understanding between local ceramic artists."&lt;ref&gt;Shlomit Bauman, "Ceramic design: Techno.logical Implements," ''Sixth Biennale of Israeli Ceramics'' (Tel Aviv: Eretz Israel Museum, 2011), pp 10-11 [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as the Armenians and the Arabs living in the Palestine worked within independent traditions, Jewish artists had to create a synthesis between European art and art in the Land of Israel under the conditions that existed there in the early 20th century.  This can be seen both in the design of the models and in the work techniques, which tended to be mechanized. In addition, while local pottery depended on family-led workshops and on cooperative activity by the artists, the Jewish potter saw himself both as an artist and as an expression of the language of art.&lt;ref&gt;See: ^Shlomit Bauman, "Materialism Liberated," Joram Rosenheimer, ed., ''Maud Friedland'' ([Tel Aviv]: Rosenheimer family, in collaboration with: Ceramic Artists Association of Israel, 2011), 13. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chava (Eva) Samuel|Chava Samuel]], who Immigrated to the Palestine in 1932, founded "Hayozer" [The Creator], the first ceramics workshop in the Jewish community in Jerusalem. "Kad VeSefel" [Jug and Cup], the ceramics workshop founded in 1934 in [[Rishon LeZion]] with [[Paula Ahronson]], produced a variety of utilitarian pots and decorative pottery, using a combination of potter's wheel and ceramic casting. The style of the pots was, for the most part functional, influenced both by the spirit of [[modernism]] and the European [[Bauhaus]] style. [[Mira Libes]], a pupil in the workshop of Samuel and Ahronson, described the pottery produced in the workshop as the direct result of "create pottery that is simple, functional, and beautiful," a philosophy intended also to improve public taste, which was deemed at that time indescribably bad. The pottery produced was generally influenced by the "Bauhaus" style, which Paula had studied, and the simple and beautiful decorative-colorful style of Eva."[18]

The motifs of the decorations on Samuel's pottery were also influenced by the archeology of the Land of Israel, as well as by Oriental art, under whose influence she produced "Eastern" images and images from the Jewish world. As opposed to the figures from the Jewish world created by the artists of the "Bezalel" school, Samuel's imaged lacked the religious dimension. The images that remained, for the most part looked like images from folklore. The decorative style of Samuel's pottery focused on individual images, drawn primarily freehand and glazed.&lt;ref&gt;Chava Samuel – Ceramicist (Jerusalem: Bezalel, 1985. Cited in: Gideon Ofrat, ''The Beginnings of Israeli Ceramics'', 1932-1962, note 3, Ceramic Artists Association of Israel. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the pottery of Samuel and Ahronson, the works of [[Hedwig Grossman]] displayed an attempt to formulate a Land of Israel "localness" in their ceramic design. Grossman made [[Aliyah]] to the Land of Israel in 1933 after studying pottery in Germany. During her first years in Palestine, Grossman already began to carry out soil surveys to determine how local materials were used in pottery production. In addition, Grossman researched how pottery was made in the Land of Israel in ancient times and what where the work methods of Arab and Armenian potters throughout the Land. In her work Grossman emphasized the use of materials from the Land of Israel. Some of her work was even influenced by local archaeological findings. Her techniques for working the material included basic geometric decoration, using local non-glaze slips ([[Slipware|engobes]]) in assorted colors.

An echo of Grossman's views can be seen in the 1940s, when [[Jacob Lev]], who served from 1939 as the head of the Sculpture Department in the "[[Bezalel|New Bezalel]]," began to offer classes in pottery in the department. Most of the pots that were made in this institution were not fired in a kiln and so did not survive, but in his article "The Pretty Pot"&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Lev, "The Pretty Pot," in: ''Bezalel ha-Hadash'' [The New Bezalel: Journal of Problems in Artistic Design] (Jerusalem: New Bezalel), no. 1 ( 941). [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; (1941), he emphasizes the modernist approach to design of the pot and the relationship between its parts in the "Bauhaus" spirit. However photographs of the pots show the influence of the architecture of the Land of Israel in the choice of the types of pots, as well as in the avoidance of decoration in the rough texture of their design.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, ''Bezalel ha-Hadash'' [The New Bezalel: Journal of Problems in Artistic Design] (Jerusalem: Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design), 1987. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The works of [[Hedwig Harag Zunz]], who arrived in the Land of Israel at the beginning of the 1940s, also represent an attempt at creating pottery with a Land of Israel "localness." In Zunz's works this was expressed primarily in her choice of local materials. Most of her work was produced using a potter's wheel, but she also created pottery with an architectural bent. In spite of her consistent use of local materials, Zunz's works differ from the archaeological direction of Hedwig Grossman's works or the oriental decoration of Eva Samuel's.  The shape of her pottery was influenced by European Modernism in its lack of decoration and in its organic tendency toward the use of the glossy surface slips of [[Terra sigillata]] or ceramic glazes.&lt;ref&gt;See: Michal Alon, "Hanna Harag Zunz: Pioneer in Ceramic Art," ''1280°c''. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her independent works, Harag Zunz also produced technical academic research and participated in various industrial projects.

==From landscape to clay, 1950–1980==
In the 1950s and 1960s there was an upswing in ceramic activity in Israel, and steps were taken toward institutionalizing ceramics as a branch of art. Alongside traditional pottery and the newly established "Studio Pottery", other forms of media began to develop, including ceramic sculpture and industrial initiatives, a small-scale industry that took its spiritual roots from European Modernism. In general, ceramic artists, like many other Israeli artists, strove toward "localness", with its identification with the land, the landscape, and the archaeology of the Land of Israel.

===Industrialization===

From the very beginning of the ceramics industry in Israel, ceramic objects were produced in casting molds.  However, the development of the Zionist industry gave impetus to speedy industrialization.[24]  The main area in which the ceramics industry developed was Haifa, where in 1938 "[[Naaman]]" where cast porcelain objects were produced, was founded.[25]  In the exhibition "Applied Art and the Prescription for Industry in the Land of Israel," held in the [[Bezalel Museum]] in Jerusalem in 1947, glazed pots were displayed by [[Hanna Harag Zunz]] as an example of cooperation among various elements of the industry.[26] In 1955 in the [[Haifa Museum of Art]] an exhibition entitled "The Ceramic Society" was mounted, in which objects and the processes of their production in the local ceramics industry were displayed.&lt;ref&gt;See: Pesel Fridberg, "Exhibition: 'The Ceramic Company', Haifa Museum of Art," ''AlHamishmar'', 30 December 1955. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1950s saw the beginning of practical cooperation between the ceramics industry and the designers and artists in the young state, with an eye to advancing the industry and raising its prestige. Similar initiatives took place in the 1960s in Israel Ceramic and Silicate Institute in the Technion, and in Bezalel, where they began testing ceramic materials for design.

[[Aharon Kahana]] - who with his wife founded "Beit Hayotzer" [Artisan's Workshop] (Haifa), which was so large he employed three assistant potters—succeeded in defining a widespread style that combined modernist abstraction with decorative folk motifs. This combination succeeded in "returning art to the people."&lt;ref name="AlHamishmar 6 February 1959"&gt;''AlHamishmar'', 6 February 1959 [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; and "making use of many shapes, which had been unacceptable in the eyes of the viewers, as decoration for ceramic creations.&lt;ref name="AlHamishmar 6 February 1959"/&gt;

Among the better known ceramic production plants were "Kol-Keramic" (Haifa), "Carnet" (Netanya Ceramics),"Ceramit" (Netanya) "Beit Halachmi" (Tel Aviv), "Bror Hayil (Bror Hayil), "Keramaklin" (Nes Tziona), "Palkeramic" (Haifa), and "Beit Hayotzer" (Ramat Gan/Petah Tikva), the ceramics workshop of Kfar Menachem, etc.  At the same time, the two most important factories were "Lapid Pottery" (1951) and "Harsa Ceramics (1956)," which combined technology with handmade techniques.

In 1952 Elisabeth Cohen came to work as a designer for Lapid Pottery.  Elisabeth Cohen had studied with Hedwig Grossman and founded the "art" department in the company.  By 1959 this department employed 20 people.&lt;ref&gt;See: Beitar, "Lapid Produces New Bathroom Fixtures," ''Davar'', 28 March 1956. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning the company produced utilitarian pots cast from the materials used to cast toilets, but little by little both the methods and the designs of the company became more sophisticated.  In addition to Cohen other designers, including [[Maud Friedland]], came to work for the company. Another art department produced ceramics in the [[Harsa Ceramics company]] from 1956-1966.&lt;ref&gt;See: Pnina Arouetty, ''Earthenware Pottery, 1956-1966'' (Ramat Gan: Beit Aharon Kahana, 2007). [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  The department was founded by [[Nehemia Azaz]], who designed his pots using local colors and materials.&lt;ref&gt;See: Israeli, Art, "The Department of 'Earthenware' Art 1955-1966," ''1280o C'', 27 Summer (2013), 24-18. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak, the department employed 30 workers. After Azaz left the department, it was run by [[Pnina Zamir Amir]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Pnina Arouetty, ''Pnina Amir-Zamir'' (Ramat Gan: Beit Aharon Kahana, 2010). [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The articles made in both companies were modernist in style and were characterized by the use of geometric styles and primarily abstract decoration.  These designs were influenced by the tradition of modernist design, from designs created in Europe during this same period, and therefore by what was perceived as the expression of Land of Israel "localness."  Azaz, for example, stated that his forms were influenced by the desert landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Aviva Limon, "''Interview with Nehemia Azaz''," (in Hebrew), 6 May 1990, can be found in the Information Center for Israeli Art, The Israel Museum, Jerusalem and in the archive of Beit Benyamini, Tel Aviv.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of porcelain by ceramics companies was concentrated for the most part in the "Naaman" and "Lapid" factories, both of which produced primarily utilitarian utensils. At the same time it is known that the industry tried to encourage local design.  Shimon Badar, for example, who was the first designer for "Naaman," also served as a lecturer on ceramic technology at the Ceramic Department of Bezalel.&lt;ref&gt;See: Shir Mellor-Yamaguchi and Anat Turbowicz, ''White Matter: Contemporary Porcelain Sculpture'' (Kibbutz Hazorea: Wilfrid Israel Museum, 2015), 5. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a large scale technological–artistic project  is the covering of the entrance to Asia House (1977-1979) in tiles produced in the porcelain molds next to "Naaman" and designed by the artist  Pinchas Eshet.&lt;ref&gt;See: ''Pinchas Eshet, Porcelain Sculptures'' (Haifa: Haifa Museum of Modern Art, 1980,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studio pottery===
The 1950s and 1960s were the most important years of ceramic activity in the field of Israeli art.  For the first time ceramic artists began to be trained in many private workshops and a variety of academic institutions.  In addition, decorative arts –including ceramic art – were no longer perceived as a foreign element in the young Israeli culture.  To a large extent these forms of media were encouraged by various government agencies.  Finally, an examination of the creations of the artists demonstrates the inculcation of a local artistic "tradition" that chose to cut itself off from the Arab ceramic tradition, the Armenian tradition, and even that of Bezalel, in favor of "modernism" and "localness," which determined the central direction of Israeli ceramics until the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;See the definition of Sarah Chinsky for the project inventing the Bezalel "tradition."  Sarah Chinsky, ''The Monarchy of the Land of the Humble: the Social Grammar of Local Art'' (Tel Aviv: HaKibbutz HaMeuhad, 2015), 96-97. [In Hebrew].&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[Hedwig Grossman]], who taught most young ceramicists in her Jerusalem studio and in [[Ein Hod]], and from 1964 in [[Givatayim]], [[Hanna Harag Zunz]] also taught them in the Oranim Seminar (today [[Oranim Academic College]]), [[Paula Ahronson]] at Wizo in Tel Aviv, and [[Gedula Ogen]] at Havat HaNoar HaTzioni (Israel Goldstein Youth Village).  In 1957 the department of ceramics at The Arts Institute at Tel-Hai College opened.&lt;ref&gt;See: Tel Hai College, Pottery, 7, August (1980), 3-7. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1958 the Department of Ceramics and Glass Design at [[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design]] was founded, next to the Schneller Orphanage.  The department was headed by David Wachtel, who had worked previously at the "Palkeramics" factory.  His teaching faculty included [[David Calderon]], [[Pnina Amir-Zamir]], and Maud Friedland.  In 1962 Gedula Ogen was appointed head of the department.&lt;ref&gt;See: ''Bezalel 100, Book 2, 1935-1965'', David Tartakover and Gideon Ofrat, eds. (Tel Aviv: The National Lottery Council for Arts and Culture, 2006), 189. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1961 and 1963 the number of students in the department grew from 26 to 50, and the amount of work space in the department  greatly increased.[38]  Another teaching institution was the "Visual Arts Center" in Beersheba.&lt;ref&gt;See: ''Bezalel 100, Book 2, 1935-1965'', David Tartakover and Gideon Ofrat, eds. (Tel Aviv: The National Lottery Council for Arts and Culture, 2006), 191, 201. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the standpoint of design, the ceramicists continued the tradition of Harag Zunz and particularly the tradition of Grossman, in everything connected to the spirit of European Modernism and in the aspiration toward the expression of what was local in their works.  Among the most significant followers of Grossman are Amnon Israeli and Gedula Ogen. From the 1960s both of them took the inspiration for their work from archaeology and the Land of Israel landscape, expressed in works that were unglazed and coated in slip&lt;ref&gt;A color based on liquid clay mixed with natural and artificial pigments.  Close variations are called "slip."&lt;/ref&gt; or exposed to an open fire during their firing.&lt;ref&gt;See: Inna Arouetty, ''Gedula Ogen: Like Nature'' (Ramat Gan: Beit Aharon Kahana, 1996).  Also, Inna Arouetty, Hedwig Grossman/Amnon Israel  (Ramat Gan: Beit Aharon Kahana,2014). [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent ceramic artists were [[Yehudit Meir]] and [[Yocheved Marx]], who worked together in Beersheba from 1958, using local materials from the earth of the Negev and fired their works at very high temperatures (1250-1300 degrees C), which was atypical for Israeli ceramicists of that period.   The works they created spanned the field from decorative to practical.

The opportunities for exhibiting and selling ceramics during that period were limited and led to the production, for the most part, of practical ceramic ware. Along with exhibitions at "Mikra-Studio" gallery (Tel Aviv, 1946-1956), which combined emphasizing artistic values with exhibiting female ceramic artists,&lt;ref&gt;Among those displaying in the gallery in the field of sculpture: Aharon Kahana (1952), Hava Mehutan (1955), Nehemia Azaz (1956).  Moshe Gershuni, for example, reported that he acquired works by Kahana, Harag Zunz, Hedwig Grossman, Jean Mayer, and others in this gallery and in the store in the neighboring building on the corner of Ben Yehudah and Idelson Streets.  See: Moshe Gershuni, "Indian Ceramics," in Sarah Breitberg Semel, Gershuni (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2010), 314. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; and "Atelier 97" (Tel Aviv),&lt;ref&gt;Chava Samuel (1960), Shelly Harari (1960), Jean Mayer&lt;/ref&gt; ceramics were sold at the Maskit stores (Tel Aviv, 1959- ?), which emphasized folkloristic elements.&lt;ref&gt;Some of the artists mounted entire exhibitions, while others displayed their works in a group exhibition or displayed special art objects for sale. The following names were listed on the exhibit: Idit Adi and Miriam Magnus (1968), Hanna Baharal (1966, 1970), Rina Peled (1969, 1971), Miriam Zamir (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition there were a number of exhibitions of ceramic art at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art and at the Bezalel Museum and at a variety of private stores.&lt;ref&gt;In the brochure Kad ve-sefer , for example, there is a list of branches of "Maskit," "Tuv taam", and "Tessora" stores in Tel Aviv, and "Charlotte" and the "Schwartz" department store in Jerusalem.  See: Nir Feldman, Material From the Wind: Chava Samuel, a Pioneer of Ceramic Art in Israel (Rishon LeZion: Rishon LeZion Museum, 2011),83. [in Hebrew]  Bertha Ordung's daughter described Hedwig Grossman's works, which were offered for sale in Rina Galleria in Jerusalem.  Other stores include "Ginger" in Jerusalem, "Traklin" and "Herzog" in Haifa, and "Galeria 119" in Tel Aviv.&lt;/ref&gt; The overwhelming majority of ceramic artists were not members of a professional artists' union, and if they were, like Grossman and Samuel, within that framework they exhibited primarily paintings and prints.  In 1966 in Tel Aviv the "Clay Museum" opened as part of the Eretz Israel Museum, exhibiting ancient ceramics next to exhibitions of Israeli artists who exhibited in the open courtyard of the pavilion.  In 1968 the Ceramic Artists Association of Israel was founded, headed by Joseph Blumenthal.

In 1963 the book Art in Israel was published, under the editorship of [[Benjamin Tammuz]].&lt;ref&gt;See: ''Art in Israel'', Benjamin Tammuz, ed., (Tel Aviv: Masada, 1963).  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The book devoted an entire chapter to art that John Cheney compiled.  In this chapter, which was accompanied by a number of photographs, Cheney surveyed such areas of art as design, jewelry making, and ceramics, which he juxtaposed to media such as drawing, sculpture, and architecture.  The presentation of ceramics and the rest of the arts as equal to other artistic media, bears witness to the importance of art during those years and its promotion by exhibitions and competitions organized by institutions such as the Israel Packaging Institute and the Israel Export Institution, etc.  On 24 September 1970, an exhibition opened in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art that surveyed the field of ceramics in Israel and was the ultimate expression of this trend.  The exhibition – "Israel Ceramics 70" – displayed 284 works of 64 artists, along with a detailed catalog that included photographs of the works as well.  In addition the works produced by another five factories ("Beit Hayotser," "Lapid," "Naaman," "Palkeramic," and "Carnet."&lt;ref&gt;See Haim Gamzo, ''Israel Ceramics 70'' (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1970). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Ein Hod school===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 13693 Ceramic wall by Louise Schatz Ein Hod.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Ceramic wall by [[Louise Schatz]], Ein Hod]]
In 1957, in close proximity to one another, [[Itche Mambush]] and his wife [[Aviva Margalit]] opened pottery workshops in [[Ein Hod]] Artists Village. The village was founded in 1953 by [[Marcel Janco]], as a village for the arts and artists. Around the workshops a group of resident artists and artists who lived nearby began to add ceramics to one of the media in which they worked. Some of these artists were identified with "New Horizons," that is, Janco, [[Yehezkel Streichman]], [[Pinchas Abramovich]], and [[Aharon Kahana]], who worked alongside artists for whom the decorative style was an integral part of their art, such as [[Louise Schatz]], [[Bezalel Schatz]], [[Jean David]], [[Genia Berger]], etc.

In their works we see a colorful, expressive approach with an emphasis on glazes not typical of the "material" tradition in local ceramics. In addition to a small amount of ceramic sculpture, these artists produced many paintings using glazing techniques, and murals using a variety of glazed ceramic tiles.&lt;ref&gt;See: Galia Bar Or and Gideon Ofrat, ''The First Decade: A Hegemony and a Plurality'' (Ein Harod: Mishkan Museum of Art, 2008), 22-23; See also: Gideon Ofrat, Archeological Ceramics: Pottery and Walls ' Aharon Kahana, Monograph (5), on the website Gideon Ofrat's Storeroom [In Hebrew].&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the artists worked the materials themselves, while others produced detailed sketches for items to be implemented in different workshops, such as the ones in Ein Hod or the one in [[Kfar Menachem]].
 
These decorative walls were part of the trend towards combining art with local architecture, and were used by other artists along with other techniques such as sgrafitto and mosaics.  One of the best known artistic event in this field took place in 1954, when a group of ceramic wall paintings by [[Aharon Kahana]], [[Jean David]], and [[Gedula Ogen]] were put in place on the [[Givat Ram]] campus of [[The Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. In 1958 sketches of these walls were even presented in the exhibition "Ten Years of Architecture in Israel" in the [[Tel Aviv Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Rachel Engel, "Between Painters and Architects: Architectural Exhibition at the Tel Aviv Museum," ''Davar'', 3 October 1958. [In Hebrew].&lt;/ref&gt; The peak of this creativity was in 1966, when an international hands-on seminar in ceramics took place in Ein Hod, at Berger's initiative.

===From pottery to ceramic sculpture===

In the second half of the 1960s the influence of different kinds of media began to appear in the works of Israeli ceramicists.  In particular the influence of Israeli sculptors could be seen. Along with the continuing use of "architectural" images and the trend toward "localness," it could be seen in the use of images of the land and desert landscapes, a divergence from the boundaries of traditional ceramics.  The aspiration toward copying nature into works of art forced the artists into seeking new artistic expressions.

The status of Land of Israel architecture as the expression of Zionist nationalism attracted not only the broad public, but also many ceramicists, to it.&lt;ref&gt;An example of this kind of connection can be found in the dictionary of Hebrew pottery terms published in 1950 by the Hebrew Language Committee (Dictionary of Pottery Terms [Jerusalem: Hebrew Language Committee, with the participation of the Bialik Institute, 1950]). See: Meira Yagid-Haimovich, Israeli Pottery: A Footnote; ''Irit Abba, Wheel. Period'' (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2009), 6. [In Hebrew] This dictionary was the work of the "Committee for Architectural Terms," which comprised a natural bridge between architecture, ceramics, and pottery of that period.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them utilized the skills they had acquired in the restoration of pottery, which was found in great numbers in the archeological digs of the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;See: Michael Feige, Tzvi Shiloni, eds. ''A Pickaxe to Dig With: Archeology and Nationalism in the Land of Israel'' (Beer-Sheva: Ben Gurion University of the Negev, 2008). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was natural, therefore, that architectural images appeared in the works of Israeli artists.  A whole group of artists such as [[David Ben Shaul]], [[Agi Yoeli]], [[David Calderon]], [[Moshe Shek]], and [[Shelly Harari]], in addition to their ceramic works, produced during this period human sculptures or animal images inspired by figurines and statuettes from antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;See: Benjamin Tammuz, ed. ''The Story of Art in Israel'' (Tel Aviv: Masada Publishers, 1980), 155-156. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Their works included a pioneering Zionist element that expressed an attempt to connect the young Israeli state with its historical and biblical past.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, "The Dialectics of the 1950s," in: Galia Bar-Or and Gideon Ofrat, The First Decade: A Hegemony and a Plurality (Ein Harod: Museum of Art, Ein Harod, 2008), 24. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Israeli ceramicists showed a tendency toward modernism, which emphasized the geometric character of the shape and the work and showed the influence of European modernism.

Most of the characteristics of sculpture can be found in works that originated on potter's wheels during those years.  A central element in the widespread distribution of works of this genre was the teaching of Gedula Ogen at Bezalel.  Ogen developed a style using the potter's wheel to achieve the volume needed for large scale relief sculpture and figurative sculpture.  In her works she continued Grossman's style of design in her emphasis on the naturally colorful quality of the material.  Most of her work dealt with images from nature and with the relationship between it and culture and art.

The main reason for the shift in style during the 1960s that deviated from the previous tradition by opening the field of Israeli ceramics to varied new points of view, was the arrival and influence of ceramics producers and professional ceramic artists, the practical implementation of which could be seen in the works of David Morris, Magdalena Hefetz, Sonia Natra and others who studied and became specialists in the United States and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Ofrat, The Beginning of Israeli Ceramics 1932-1962, 17. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

An article from 1972 describes the creation of one of these sculptures by [[Rina Peleg]], a graduate of Bezalel, who "leaning heavily on the potter's wheel and round motions, creates the body of her sculpture. Only after this does she knead and shape the finished form with her hands, creating its decoration and ornamentation."&lt;ref name="Plank 36-39"&gt;Shlomit Bauman, "Shlomit Bauman in a Conversation with Rina Kimchi, 'A Plank in a Burned-out House'," ''1280°'', 11 (2004), 36-39. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; However she soon began to request that the artists "jettison the jug"&lt;ref name="Plank 36-39"/&gt; and the decorative dimension of traditional ceramics in favor of freestanding art.  Artists such as [[Neta Avraham]], Shelly Harari, [[Nora and Naomi]], [[Jean Meir]], Maud Friedland, and others, deviated from the tradition of "sculpting with the potter's wheel" in order to try out different techniques, particularly freestanding sculpture.  A central motif was the imitation of formations found in local landscapes and their conversion into objects of sculpture.

The Israeli landscape, especially the desert landscape, was perceived as isolated from modern westernized society, and served as an inspiration to artists in creating the form, texture, and color of artistic objects.  In this way these artists joined the general trend among many other Israeli artists who created in their works images of an archaic utopia, many of them even under the late influence of "Canaanite" art.  The objects they created tended towards abstract plant structures or towards the building of objects that suggested archaic cultural structures.

As ceramics drew closer to the field of art, however, foreign influences also creeped into the Israeli tradition.  [[Siona Shimshi]], for example, during these years returned from studies in the United States, where she had been exposed to postmodern art, such as Pop Art.  Her ceramic works combined these influences with biographical works and psychological images.  For example, in her works such as "Puppet Theater"
&lt;ref&gt;For photo of the work: See: Haim Gamzo, ''Israeli Ceramics 70'' (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1970). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; or "Class Photo 1939" (1965), the artist aimed to express psychological and social themes, something that was unusual in Israeli ceramics of the time.&lt;ref&gt;See Aya Miron, "Ziona Shemesh," in: ''1965 Today'', Mira Lapidot, Curator (Jerusalem: Israel Museum, 2015), 138-241.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1960s, large scale sculptures began to appear in Israeli art, such as the bronze sculpture "Sheep of the Negev" by [[Itzhak Danziger]], Assemblage art works, such as those of [[Igael Tumarkin]] and [[Yehiel Shemi]], or works making use of various techniques such as installations or the use of non-artistic materials, such as those created by the artists of the group "Ten Plus," while at the same time ceramic works continued to be limited by the size of the kilns in which they were fired.  However, apparently it was the influence of conceptual art, which arrived in Israel in the 1970s, that cut off ceramic activity from Israeli art.  This is particularly noticeable against the background of "earth" and "place" imagery among the Israeli artistic vanguard of this period.

==From deconstruction to reconstruction, 1980–2010==
In the 1980s a fundamental change occurred in the way Israeli ceramic art was perceived.  The primary cause of the change was the disruption of the local tradition in Israeli ceramics.  Some of the reasons can be discerned in the perception of a break which Israeli society felt in a delayed reaction to the [[Yom Kippur War]], and in reaction to the First Intifada.&lt;ref&gt;Ilana Tannenbaum, "The Time of the Post: the 1980s in Israeli Art," in: ''Check Post: the 1980s in Israeli Art'' (Haifa: Haifa Museum of Art, 2008), 23-24. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the influence of postmodern culture began to trickle into the local culture.

Even though postmodernism had once been described as the expression of "the personal, [with a tendency towards the] hand-made, metaphorical, figurative, [and] decorative",&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Ofrat, "Post Modernism," ''Achshav'', 47-48 (1983), 270.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; traits that came naturally to Israeli ceramic artists and their art, paradoxically the distance between them and mainstream Israeli art widened.  At the same time, in painting, sculpture, and photography objections began to be heard against the status of the object as a work of art, whereas until the 1990s the field of Israeli ceramics had primarily adopted the attitude of "identity politics," as the central tenet of postmodernism.  In place of historical and archeological relationships, a series of personal relationships began to appear, most of them expressivist, which deviated from the traditional Israeli ceramic tradition that had existed up to this time.

This sidelining of ceramics, and especially of pottery, from the main museums,&lt;ref&gt;Until 1993, when Lidia Zavatsky had an exhibition, there had never been an exhibition of ceramics (ceramic design and pottery) in the department of Design and Architecture of the Israel Museum.  See: Design and Architecture in the Israel Museum: Portrait of a Department 1973-1997 (Jerusalem: Israel Museum). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It is true that Gideon Ofrat mentioned in the chapter dealing with "Canaan" in ''The Story of Art in Israel'', Benjamin Tammuz, ed. (Tel Aviv: Masada Publishers, 1980), the attention the field of art paid to the early days of Israeli ceramics and to Ziona Shemesh, in her interview in Eser Plus, but it is well known that the part that the various design media played is missing from the history of Israeli art.&lt;/ref&gt; led to the establishment of a number of independent cooperative galleries in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv,&lt;ref&gt;See: Yigal Zalmona, ''100 Years of Israeli Art'' (Jerusalem: Israel Museum, 2010), 336. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; for the display and merchandising of ceramics, such as "Ruach Cadim" (1987), the  "Altogether 8" group (1990), and "Shlush Shloshim (1992).  In 1991 Aharon Kahana's house in [[Ramat Gan]] was opened as a ceramics gallery.

===Myths in the material, 1980-1990===
In spite of the marginal place the medium occupied, postmodern expressions in ceramics did have a certain impact because of the works of [[Gideon Ofrat]], one of the most important of the artists who translated postmodern thinking into an aesthetic in the 1980s. In 1985 Ofrat curated the exhibition "Toward a Myth Without God" in the [[Jerusalem Artists House]].  In the exhibition catalog, Ofrat described ceramics as an expression of metaphysics, and pottery and pots as a means of direct connection to nature.  A connection that Ofrat described as a dialectic of "proceeding toward a double eternity – an eternity of absorbing living and an eternity of absorbing dying"&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Ofrat, Towards a Godless Myth (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Artists House, 1985), 63. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; connected to the practicality and the symbolism of the pottery.  In this Ofrat reflected the phenomology of Martin Heidegger and Derrida, who emphasized earth and object (and the pitcher as a characteristic expression of this) as an intersection between life and death.&lt;ref&gt;See also the later article of Ofrat, "The Slopes and the Names." [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the artists sought to probe the personal and the biographical through archetypal images, and thus express the symbolic dimension of art.  From the point of view of form, it was manifested by developing means of sculptural expression in a more figurative direction and with a tendency toward ignoring the individual object in favor of the sculptural array.&lt;ref&gt;For the most part, ceramic artists tended to display their sculptures and not installations, whose avant garde roots were expressed by exposing the means of creation of the exhibition itself.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Siona Shimshi]], for example, developed her ceramic sculpture as a series of  archetypal human forms made of bare material.&lt;ref&gt;See: Siona Shimshi, "Anatomy of the Exhibition In Preparation for "Everybody is Sitting Down," in: Kaderut [Pottery], 10 (December 1984),  25-28; Siona Shimshi, Siona Shimshi: Preliminary Summary, 1987 (s.l: s.n., 1987). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nora and Naomi]] began to communicate with the sculptural field when they started to make use of motifs of journeys or nature images.  The works of [[Moshe Shek]] are somewhere on the spectrum between ceramics and sculpture, expressed in a sort of postmodern incarnation of the Israeli ceramic tradition.  The enormous pieces he created, which he called "containers" (1986), were decorated with simple designs that emphasized the natural colors of the material,&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Shak: Photographs, Ruti Ofek, ed. (Tefen: The Open Museum, Tefen and Omer Industrial Parks, 2006. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; and these sculptures displayed stylized imaginary animals made of clay cylinders that emanated echoes of  "Canaanite" sculpture.  Other artists, such as David Morris&lt;!--not mentioned on the dab page--&gt; and [[Mark Yudell]], used images specifically in order to create a private mythological world, which reflected their personal experiences, along with a dollop of humor and irony.

Another aspect of the preoccupation with the biographical can be seen in the infiltration of religious motifs into Israeli art in general, and into Israeli ceramic art in particular.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, "Flight from the Myth and Towards It," Towards a Godless Myth (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Artists House, 1985), 56. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marie Balian]], for example, an Armenian artist, from the 1970s geared her art towards monumental wall paintings made of glazed tiles.&lt;ref&gt;These works had a great impact in the 1980s and 1990s, and 3 murals were even mounted on the walls of Beit HaNassi [President's Residence] in Jerusalem (1986).  At the same time traditional Armenian ceramics flourished because of the research activity of Nurit Canaan-Kedar.  In 1982, for example, the Eretz Israel Museum hosted the exhibition "Armenian Pottery of Jerusalem."&lt;/ref&gt;  Her images were drawn from the Armenian ceramic tradition, with changes that were expressed in the design of the composition, which was transformed into the fantastic.

A similar trend can be seen in the work of Jewish ceramicists, whose Judaica works were no stranger to their culture of the material.  [https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%A8_%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%94 Abraham and Pnina Gofer], for example, in the 1970s and 1980s displayed Seder plates made using casting molds, with images done in the ethnographic style, decorated with colorful glazes.  In contrast, Meira Una, in the mid-1980s created a series of Chanukah lamps that combined images from Orthodox Judaism with architectural images.  Her work is typified by the use of untreated material (without clay slips or glazes), with scribbles or engraved writing, and with no polishing or finishing of the form.  All of these works emphasized the status of the personal and the preoccupation with ars poetica in ceramics and art.

At the same time, the most prominent ceramic artist who made use of Jewish motifs came from the field of art and painting.  In the mid-1980s [[Moshe Gershuni]] began to create what became known as "Jewish ceramics."&lt;ref&gt;In his work "The Blood of My Heart (1980), Gershuni used plates dotted with paint stains, although during this period he made use of glass paint.&lt;/ref&gt; Gershuni made use of ready made plates that he bought second hand.  On these he drew with ceramic paints for low-fire pottery.&lt;ref&gt;Among the artists Gershuni helped were Lidia Zavatsky (according to Gershuni himself) and Daniel Davis (according to Davis's wife, Aviva Bar-On).&lt;/ref&gt; The images that appeared on his pottery combined excerpts from prayers, swastikas, and Magen Davids, which also can be seen in his paintings from these years.&lt;ref&gt;See: Moshe Gershuni, "Jewish Ceramics," in: Sarah Breitberg Semel, Gershuni (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2010), 314; Itamar Levy, Moshe Gershuni: Works, 1987-1990 (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1990), Plates 31-33, unnumbered. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibitions of these works in 1988 at Bezalel and in 1990 at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art generated wide publicity.

===Body, fragments, and slivers of identity===
Clear signs of the coming transition from pottery to ceramic sculpture could be seen during the second half of the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s.  A large number of ceramic artists began to adopt ideas from painting and sculpture in their art.  These ideas, in the eyes of these artists, conferred a new legitimacy on pottery and on the objects they created, both as an expression of their personal feelings and as an expression of ars poetica.

An example of the renewed relationship between sculpture and pottery can be seen in the works of artists on the border between traditional pottery and contemporary art.  [[Rayah Redlich]], for example, created large scale pots, which she presented as a renewed esthetic and cultural examination, and on which she used techniques of printing and painting "on the shards."  Many of these works were displayed on pedestals that were part of the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;See: Raya Redlich: Fallen Halos (Haifa: Haifa University, 2002), 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Daniel Davis]] used his potter's wheel to create large scale pots whose "shards" were then joined together in bundles by steel strips.  A group of about 70 of them appeared as part of "A Woman of the Pots," a performance and film created by his wife, [[Adina Bar-On]], in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;See: Alec Mishory, "Song of Praise to Mud," in: The way of Clay, 50 years of Israeli Ceramics (Ramat Gan: Ceramics Museum Aharon Kahana, 1998) (unnumbered pages).&lt;/ref&gt; Besides being used for musical percussion instruments, the pots pointed to themes like death and Judaism.  Another group that dealt with the imagery of the material and of pottery by means of a representative medium was the [[Zik Group]], whose works include a pot as a central image.  In the installation "Anarzik" (1997), for example, the group created, on the structure of a potter's wheel, a complex pot that underwent a transformation of its technology and its form before the eyes of the public.&lt;ref&gt;Einat Adi, "Anarzik," Studio 83, June (1987), 9-13. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another prominent artist was [[Lidia Zavadsky]], who even served as the head of the Department of Ceramics and Glass Design at Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem.  Like other artists, Zavadsky inserted sculpture into her work as an integral part of her postmodern approach.  Between the years 1992-1994 Zavadsky produced a series of pot-sculptures that turned out to be the highlight of her artistic output.  The pots were monumental in size, glazed in intense colors, and a combination of work on the potter's wheel and sculpture.  In spite of her themes of corporeality and death, the form and the internal relationships were the central artistic concern of Zavadsky's work.  Through them the artist grappled with European and Asian pottery traditions. These works received more artistic recognition than any ceramic works up to that time and were displayed as well in the Israel Museum.

Only at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st did ceramic artists begin to make more consistent use of installation art within ceramic art.&lt;ref&gt;In connection with this, one should note the work of Gideon Gechtman from the mid-1990s on ceramics and on the relationship between the original and the copy.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists such as [[Talia Tokatly]], [[Hadass Rosenberg Nir]], [[Shlomit Bauman]], [[Yael Atzmony]], [[Maya Muchawsky Parnas]], and others created installations that combined different media, such as sculpture, ceramics, video, etc.  In their works we see a combining of elements of their personal identity through the disassembly and assembly of objects saturated with political or personal history.

An opposing philosophy to this sculptural trend was the return to the pottery tradition of which one expression was the increasing adoption of porcelain as the material used on potter's wheels and in casting beginning in the 1990s. This happened both because this material began to arrive in Israel on a regular basis, and because artists began to be trained in the use of this material within the academic framework&lt;ref&gt;Among the teachers was Stephan Agai, who taught porcelain casting at Bezalel in the 1990s (See: Shir Mellr-Yamaguchi and Anat Turbowicz, White Matter: Contemporary Porcelain Sculpture (Hazorea: Wilfrid Israel Museum, 2015), 5).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as privately.&lt;ref&gt;Among the artists who have trained potters in workshops in the use of porcelain from the beginning of the 20th century are Irit Abba and Rani Gilat.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the artists who began to use porcelain on potter's wheels was [[Irit Abba]]. The use of this material sharpened her concentration on the form of the pot and allowed her to develop a deconstructionist concept of the pot, of her perception of pottery, and of her view of European culture. She emphasized the materiality of the pots and jugs she produced in the early 2000s by using slotting and chinking on their surface, by combining the porcelain with "paper clay,"&lt;ref&gt;Material mixed with paper.  This material serves as a stabilizer in the making of pots and is characterized by more sculptural flexibility.&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian paste, and shavings, and by using intense colors.&lt;ref&gt;See Meira Yagid Haimovici, Irit Abba. The Wheel. Period. (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  In other artists as well, such as [[Esther Beck]] and [[Shulamit Teiblum-Millar]], we can see this renewed interest in pottery and in the materials of ceramics to emphasize the work processes used in the creation of artistic objects.

In spite of massive training in the technology of design, the disappearance of the ceramics industry in Israel pushed artists, and particularly designers, to the creation of individual objects or of objects in small series, and sometimes in large ones, using hand casting techniques.  The most prominent of these artists are designers such as [[Ami Derech]], [[Dov Ganchrow]], and [[Jonathan Hopp]].

The {{nihongo|'''''Kagerou Project'''''|カゲロウプロジェクト|Kagerō Purojekuto|lit. "Heat Haze Project"}}, also known as {{Nihongo|"Kagerou Daze"|カゲロウデイズ|Kagerō Deizu|lit. "Heat Haze Daze"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4840149712|script-title=ja:カゲロウデイズ公式ビジュアルファンブック‐|trans-title=Kagerou Daze Official Visual Fanbook|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|accessdate=December 5, 2013|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Kagerou Days", is a Japanese mixed-media project. It started as a [[Vocaloid]] song series created by {{nihongo|Jin (Shizen no Teki-P)|じん(自然の敵P)||}}. The story revolves around the Mekakushi Dan, a group of young people with unusual eye-related powers.

The series became popular on the video sharing website [[Niconico]] after the release of the music video and song for "Kagerou Daze", which primarily featured character Hibiya Amamiya (supporting character Hiyori Asahina referred to only in the song's lyrics), also gave the series its name. The song has amassed over 3 million views and is the most popular song of the project. Seven light novels have been released, written by Jin and illustrated by {{nihongo|Sidu|しづ|Shizu}}. A manga adaptation with illustrations by {{nihongo|Mahiro Satou|佐藤まひろ|Satō Mahiro|}}, began serialization in ''[[Monthly Comic Gene]]'' on June 15, 2012, also written by Jin. A 12-episode anime adaptation titled {{nihongo|'''''Mekakucity Actors'''''|メカクシティアクターズ|Mekakushiti Akutāzu|lit. "Blindfold-city Actors"}}—"Mekakucity" being a [[portmanteau]] of "mekakushi" ("blindfold" in Japanese) and "city"—aired between April 12 and June 28, 2014. The series was directed by [[Akiyuki Shinbo]] and animated by [[Shaft (company)|Shaft]], with the script also written completely by Jin.

==Plot==
In the novels and anime, Shintarō Kisaragi of "Kashiwa City", Japan is an 18-year-old [[hikikomori|hiki]]-[[NEET]] who has not left his room in two years, engrossing himself with his computer and the internet. However, on August 14, due to the messing about of the cyber girl Ene, who lives inside his computer, Shintarō spills soda on his computer keyboard and is forced to go outside to buy a new one, due to the fact that during the Obon festival none of the stores will deliver until August 17. (In the manga's second alternate storyline, he goes to buy food for his female pet rabbit; Tono.) Shintarō goes to the department store, where a group of criminals break in and hold the people inside hostage for ransom. Here he comes in contact with a group of people calling themselves the {{nihongo|"Mekakushi Dan"|メカクシ団||lit. "Blindfold Gang"}}, who stop the robbery with their mysterious eye powers and "force" Shintarō to join into their group.

Before this occurs, in the novel and anime, Shintarō's younger sister, Momo Kisaragi, is a popular idol and first-year high school student who has the ability to attract people's attention. This is due to the "Drawing Eyes" ability, which she cannot control and causes people to look at her wherever she goes. One day, while fleeing from a horde of fans, she meets the Mekakushi Dan leader, Tsubomi Kido, who invites Momo to join, which she does. In the manga adaptation, however, events take different turns.

In the novels and anime, while meeting the first four members of the Mekakushi Dan, Marry trips and gets Momo's phone wet, and the Mekakushi Dan all go to the department store to buy a new phone for Momo. Kido uses her ability to keep people from staring at Momo, but while in the store, they find out Shintarō is there at the same time. The terrorists break in and take all the shoppers hostage, but with Kido's eye power, she, Momo, Marry, Seto, and Kano are invisible and thus do not get caught. They work together to stop the heist, though Shintarō passes out, and they bring him to their hideout and introduce him and Ene as members once the former awakens. Afterwards, they all go to the amusement park to have fun. However, further events begin to unfold.

The prologue for the novels' storyline is told in the second novel, ''-a headphone actor-''. Takane Enomoto and Haruka Kokonose, students of Kenjirō Tateyama, plan a class booth for their school's cultural festival. Haruka gets an idea to host a shooting booth; however this idea could not be fulfilled due to Kenjirō spending all their booth funds on a rare specimen. Takane, being a highly skilled gamer, decides that instead of a shooting booth with a large amount of equipment, they should make a video game of a first-person shooter. Kenjirō would be in charge of programming, Haruka was in charge of illustration and Takane was responsible for playing as the opponent. Their plan captured a great amount of attention, good and bad.

The series contains alternative storylines, endings (and in some cases, beginnings) depending on the format of the media, called "routes".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Kagerou Project Perfect Guide" (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

* Music Route, occurring between the years 2011-2013 initially and otherwise beyond, is the original first "route". It comes first in the official "timelines" order. It contains all of the official music videos for the "Kagerou Project" songs, with music by Jin, and animations by Wannyanpū and Sidu (later only Sidu).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Many notable songs, however, are left out of the initial, chronological "music route" described, though they are stated to still be included in the overall route. "Lost Time Memory" in Music Route splits into "Route XX", "Route 1", and "Route 2", with "XX" being a "bad ending", "1" leading to the main storyline, and "2" implied a "good ending".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* Manga Route, published between the years 2012 (June) and currently, comes second in the official "timelines" order. Though it debuted in June 2012, Jin confirmed he was working on the manga earlier on, writing the story for it as of "Konoha's World Situation"'s music video release in May 2012. The manga would later split into two alternate timelines, the second following drastically different events from the first.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* Novels Route, published between the years 2012 (May) through 2017 (2018 for the US release), comes after Manga Route and seemingly before the Mekakucity Actors anime in the official "timelines" order.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* Mekakucity Actors Route, the initially airing anime which aired beginning of April 2014 through June 2014, was not included in the official timelines of the "Kagerou Project Perfect Guide" (2016); however, the anime itself signifies more initially conclusive events. The lack of inclusion in the official timelines, despite its existence at the time, seems to indicate it comes after them as well.
* Kagerou Daze -in a day's- (カゲロウデイズ-in a day's-) is an MX4D produced animated short movie in which the Mekakushi Dan join together to once again stop an incident occurring at the mall. This Mekakushi Dan consists of Dan members 1-7 initially, and also containing Ene, Hibiya Amamiya, Konoha, and Hiyori Asahina. This is despite many notable events of the previous "routes". Certain other members related to the Dan do not appear in this "route", while instead "new" characters do; however, the "new" characters' identities were kept somewhat secret, including their names. An initial promotion for the film described it as a "Route-2", though the events contained seem wholly different to the "Route-2" that occurs in "Lost Time Memory"'s music video. The "new" characters were created specifically for this film.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Various other (including smaller or shorter) "timelines" are also contained within major "routes" or other side materials. These are all indicated in detail in the "Kagerou Project Perfect Guide" (2016).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; While many "timelines" occur between the dates of August 14–15 (and in some cases a short time beyond, such as August 17, among other dates) some "timelines"'s initial storylines are indicated to happen before the "main" series begins. This often involves the backstories of the "trio" of Kido, Kano, and Seto and their encounters, on their own or otherwise, and notably involving supporting characters Ayano Tateyama, and Mekakushi Dan member Marry Kozakura (notably detailing her meeting with character Seto). Yet more timelines occur detailing Marry's own backstory, and events that happen long before that; also indicated by which timeline, or "August 15th" (among similar close dates) is referred to.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

:{{voiced by|[[Yūko Kaida]]}}
:Kido is member No. 1 of the Mekakushi Dan and its current leader. She is often mistaken as a male due to her ambiguous appearance. The other members of the Dan call her "Danchō" (lit. gang leader). Like Kano and Seto, she is addressed by her legal last name (which she retains) even by her closest friends. Her personal song is {{Nihongo|"Never Lost Word"|失想ワアド|Shissō Wādo}}, though she initially debuted in {{Nihongo|"Blindfold Chord"|メカクシコード| Mekakushi Chord}}.&lt;ref name="Mekakushi Dan Official Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[「EDWORD RECORDS」]]|date=September 29, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:She was born as the first daughter of a wealthy family, but due to being the illegitimate child between her biological father and his mistress, her biological mother, she always felt out of place, even at home. Because she was always treated cautiously by those around her, she harbored a strong desire to "disappear". One day, her father's business went bankrupt, driving him to set their house on fire. After being burned to death in the blaze, Kido came into contact with the Heat Haze along with her older half sister Rin ({{voiced by|[[Yuki Kaida]]}}) and was possessed by the snake with the "Concealing Eyes" ability, thus acquiring the power to hide her presence, as well as the presence of anyone else within a two meter radius. She would then proceed to forget this event (of the Heat Haze) completely, until she has to remember it later on in the seventh novel, "From the Darkness" (partially told from her point of view, with her as the "lead" of the story). Becoming childhood friends with Seto and Kano in the same orphanage, she was later fostered&lt;ref name="mekakushidan.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/ayano|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[「EDWORD RECORDS」]]|date=September 29, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; temporarily by the Tateyama family, until events forced them out of the Tateyamas' home, including a "route" where they cut off all ties with Ayano. Initially encouraged by Ayano that having red eyes was the sign of a hero, she and the "trio" (her, Seto, and Kano) started the Mekakushi Dan. After Ayano's death, she was then given the role of "leader".

:In the manga's alternate second timeline, Kido is the first to be killed after stumbling upon the Snake of Clearing Eyes. Kano then reflects on her death after she is found, and while later reconciling with Ayano, who did not get to reconcile with Kido in turn before Kido died. The manga also reveals the event of Kano first meeting Kido at the orphanage, told during the different alternative second timeline (also different from the novels version). Kido gives Kano her coat, as she noticed he was cold, Kano reacting with a surprised expression. The timeline would then go on to explain the two became fast childhood friends before meeting Seto later on, becoming a childhood friend of Seto's as well; the three being described officially, in relationship charts published in the official website as well as "Kagerou Project Perfect Guide" (2016),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; as seeing each other as "childhood friends".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

: Though Kido (in the novels) initially requests they do not use [[keigo]] (Japanese formalities), as it reminds her of her biological family, and because she dislikes such formalities now; Kano in the manga's alternate second timeline thought he ''was'' originally going to use [[keigo]] with her before she requested that. Initially dropping the formalities and beginning to call her by her first name alone, "Tsubomi", while with the Tateyamas and while during middle school two years before the main series begins (including while attending the school festival put on by Haruka and Takane), Kano would later come to address her by her last name ("Kido") after they leave the Tateyama household (an event which occurs in every "route" described in the "Kagerou Project Perfect Guide" (2016).),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; the other two of the trio doing the same for him in every "route".

:Though Kido was initially described (in Mekakucity Actors' script) with an "official" age of "17", and Kano and Seto "16", this would not be chronologically possible as the "trio" of Kido, Kano, and Seto are all in the same school grade, with varying birthdays (January 2, May 10, and March 3rd respectively). As a typical Japanese school year begins in April and ends in March (the series taking place in "Kashiwa City", Japan, later noted to also be in the Chiba prefecture) the ages conflicted with the official timelines, many taking place on August 14th-August 15th and later (in some cases) 17th. Sidu's published official artbook would later re-confirm Kido's age being "16", as Kano's is also officially changed correctly to "17", him (May 10) being older than Kido (January 2). Seto (birthday March 3rd) is the youngest of the trio, though still in the same grade as them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

:Seto is member No. 2 of the Mekakushi Dan. He is often portrayed as the "nice" one of the group, and gets along very well with Marry. Like Kano and Kido, he is addressed by his legal last name (which he retains) even by his closest friends. His song is {{Nihongo|"Shōnen Brave"|少年ブレイブ||"Brave Boy"}}.

:As a young boy, his small body and timid nature resulted in him being often bullied, and he had trouble speaking with people. He considered an abandoned dog (named "Hanako") to be his only friend, and wished that he could "understand how people felt without using words". One stormy day, he witnessed some kids trying to throw his dog friend into a river. Despite his efforts, the dog was thrown in, and Seto threw himself into the river in order to save it. As he drowned, he came into contact with the Heat Haze and was possessed by the snake with the "Stealing Eyes" ability, acquiring the ability to read others' minds upon eye contact. However, he generally dislikes using his eye ability as he feels that it is invasive and makes communication redundant, so he avoids using it unless it is absolutely necessary. He eventually was fostered&lt;ref name="mekakushidan.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/ayano|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[「EDWORD RECORDS」]]|date=September 29, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; temporarily by the Tateyama family along with Kido and Kano. Together they created the Mekakushi Dan after being initially encouraged by Ayano.&lt;ref name="Mekakushi Dan Official Website"/&gt;

:In "Imagination Forest" (as "{{Nihongo|"Sōzō Foresuto"|空想フォレスト||"Imagination Forest"}}")'s original music video for the "music route", where he first debuted, he comes into contact with Marry as his "younger" looking design, animated initially here for the first time by (わんにゃんぷー Wannyanpū). His expression is partly hidden the entire time, as his full redesign to look "older" hadn't yet been made by animator Sidu (this would not occur until later on, with the official website's reveal). In {{Nihongo|"Kūsō Forest"|空想フォレスト||"Fantasy Forest"}}, Seto appears with his eyes and expressions visible, now fully redesigned, with his "older" self appearing towards the end as well. Both music videos have slight differences between the two in their animation styles and noticeable changes in their endings, though {{Nihongo|"Kūsō Forest"|空想フォレスト||"Fantasy Forest"}} debuted later on. The music video for Seto's song, {{Nihongo|"Shōnen Brave"|少年ブレイブ||"Brave Boy"}}, shows the younger Seto alternating and standing side by side with the older Seto in some scenes, implying the two are aware something is happening, as they hold hands at the end. The younger Seto in {{Nihongo|"Shōnen Brave"|少年ブレイブ||"Brave Boy"}} once again meets Marry in a similar fashion to both {{Nihongo|"Sōzō Foresuto"|空想フォレスト||"Imagination Forest"}} and {{Nihongo|"Kūsō Forest"|空想フォレスト||"Fantasy Forest"}}. In both music videos, he appears to play music for her to hear, using his phone (though initially looking similar to a music player in {{Nihongo|"Sōzō Foresuto"|空想フォレスト||"Imagination Forest"}}).&lt;ref name="Mekakushi Dan Official Website"/&gt;

:In the manga's alternate first timeline, {{Nihongo|"Sōzō Foresuto"|空想フォレスト||"Imagination Forest"}} is referred to as an initial chapter title for the Japanese edition, before changing abruptly to {{Nihongo|"Kūsō Forest"|空想フォレスト||"Fantasy Forest"}} in the manga's alternate second timeline. This change possibly references the music videos, as the entire course of the typical plot changes in the manga route's second timeline, when Marry hears loud text message notifications on Seto's phone instead of music playing, becoming frightened by the sound. The text message notifications are coming from a worried younger Kano, Kido, and Ayano, as Seto was already with the Tateyamas in this "route". (In both {{Nihongo|"Sōzō Foresuto"|空想フォレスト||"Imagination Forest"}} and {{Nihongo|"Kūsō Forest"|空想フォレスト||"Fantasy Forest"}}'s music videos, Ayano's connection to the trio hadn't been revealed yet, as it wouldn't be revealed until the later "Ayano's Theory of Happiness" music video.) The author, Jin, had also commented in 2012 in the official "Kagerou Daze Disintegration Book" that Ayano as a character was still being finalized around that time. (Both {{Nihongo|"Sōzō Foresuto"|空想フォレスト||"Imagination Forest"}} and {{Nihongo|"Kūsō Forest"|空想フォレスト||"Fantasy Forest"}}'s music videos, meanwhile, had debuted by May 18, 2012, when {{Nihongo|"Kūsō Forest"|空想フォレスト||"Fantasy Forest"}} debuted.) Kano as a character also was not revealed nor finalized until the first novel was released and the official website opened in 2012. Thus, in both {{Nihongo|"Sōzō Foresuto"|空想フォレスト||"Imagination Forest"}} and {{Nihongo|"Kūsō Forest"|空想フォレスト||"Fantasy Forest"}}, only Kido is seen at the end with Seto, and not Kano, who wouldn't appear until the later music video for {{Nihongo|"Kisaragi Attention"|如月アテンション}}.&lt;ref name="Mekakushi Dan Official Website"/&gt;

:In the official spinoff series "Mekakucity Talkers", the "Trio" of Kido, Kano and Seto appears to now live at the Mekakushi Dan's hideout while both Ayano and Kenjirou are still alive and living at the Tateyama's household (Ayaka Tateyama, however, does not initially appear, and timeline differences seemingly occur in Talkers as well). Initially, including in earlier Talkers chapters, the Trio and the Tateyamas still appeared to function as a foster unit, such as when they talk about celebrating Kenjirou's birthday (Ayano, here seemingly alive, also appears at the household). However, later on in Talkers Chapter 29, a conversation occurs between Marry, Seto, Kano, and Shintarō as they discuss "siblings". Marry claims she wants a "brother" (or, specifically, an "''[[Japanese honorifics|onii-chan]]''"-like figure), and targets the boys present in her "search" for an "''onii-chan''". Previously during the same chat, Shintarō asks Kano if the Trio were "kind of" like siblings, to which Kano replies saying he doesn't believe he (Kano) has much "''onii-chan'' power" ("big brother power"), eventually implying Shintarō has more of that than he does. Seto would later join in the conversation, agreeing with Kano as well (while also stating Shintarō has the "longest history as an ''Onii-chan''"). The two frequently try to escape becoming Marry's "''onii-chan''", despite the earlier published alternative second manga storyline, and at one point Seto implies Marry calling him "Seto-onii-chan" feels weird ("''Uh, that way of referring to me gives me a weird feeling... I wish you would drop it...''") Eventually, the boys resolve the issue with Marry by them all agreeing they can be "friends" instead of siblings. Marry would later respond stating, "I don't need an ''Onii-chan''. I [want to] go have fun with a friend."

:Though Kido was initially described (in Mekakucity Actors' script) with an "official" age of "17", and Kano and Seto "16", this would not be chronologically possible as the "trio" of Kido, Kano, and Seto are all in the same school grade, with varying birthdays (January 2, May 10, and March 3rd respectively).

Sidu's published official artbook would later re-confirm Kido's age being "16", as Kano's is also officially changed correctly to "17", him (May 10) being older than Kido (January 2).

:{{voiced by|[[Shinnosuke Tachibana]]}}, [[Yuki Kaida]] (young)
:Kano is member No. 3 of the Mekakushi Dan. He is depicted as a deceitful young man, to the point where no one can tell if he's lying or telling the truth. His song is {{Nihongo|"Yobanashi Deceive"|夜咄ディセイブ||"Night Tales Deceive"}}.

:When Kano was younger, he did not attend preschool or kindergarten and instead lived alone with his mother in an apartment. His emotionally unstable mother raised her hand against him from time to time, and the neighbors spread rumors that he was being abused by her. In the novels "route", he believed that he was wrong for upsetting her, and desired strongly to "hide the bruises/wounds on his body" from those around him because they were the reason the neighbors disliked his mother. One day (in the novels "route"), his apartment was broken into by thieves. Kano's mother was stabbed and killed as she tried to protect him. He was stabbed to death as well when he tried to fight against the thieves, coming into contact with the Heat Haze. He was then possessed by the snake with the "Deceiving Eyes" ability, acquiring the power to alter how people around him perceive him and anything in immediate contact with him.

:He was eventually brought to an orphanage and was later fostered&lt;ref name="mekakushidan.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/ayano|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[「EDWORD RECORDS」]]|date=September 29, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; temporarily by the Tateyama family, where he met Kido, Seto. While being fostered&lt;ref name="mekakushidan.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/ayano|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[「EDWORD RECORDS」]]|date=September 29, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; temporarily by the Tateyama family, they meet a younger Ayano (Kano having already met her previously as a stranger in the novels "route"). They created a team of "heroes" and Kano gave it its name, the Mekakushi Dan—"Mekakushi" being a pun on Kido's eye ability. Unlike Seto, Kano uses his eye ability frequently, shifting outward emotions on a whim while never showing what he is truly feeling on the inside. He and Ayano were very close, as evidenced by the fact that (in the novels and anime "routes") she only shared her suspicions about Kenjirō with him. As a result (in the novels "route") he often impersonated her and went to school in her stead, while she researched a way to stop the plans of Clearing Eyes. Ayano's death affects him greatly, and the added trauma of (in the novels "route") having to pretend to be Ayano's corpse during the funeral (as she did not leave behind a body) leaves him emotionally distressed. Though he uses his power to maintain a mask of lightheartedness and mischief, he develops a tendency to lash out at people close to him, sometimes by imitating people they care about, such as when he impersonated Haruka to upset Ene, or when impersonating Ayano to upset Shintarō.

:In the music video for {{Nihongo|"Yobanashi Deceive"|夜咄ディセイブ||"Night Tales Deceive"}} in "music" route, Kano continuously walks the streets at night. He briefly is seen wearing hair clips while grinning, while images of a younger Seto and younger Kido are also seen behind him (Ayano is also noted to wear such hair clips; Seto being shown wearing them too in the video). Kano is later seen with a "female" form, shown more than once (including together) in both the official music video as well as published artbooks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He is always "Deceiving", initially believing himself to be something like a "monster". When a "monster" (implied to be Clearing Eyes in the novels) speaks to him one day, Kano begins to descend into always telling "lies", unable to tell his true self from his "Deceiving" self. He is frequently seen around and holding (including up to his face) masks, indicating his "Deceiving". At the end of the video, he bows to the viewer, as if it was a performance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

:In the manga's alternate second timeline, his relationship with Ayano is more strained due to him being angry at her for suggesting to kill Marry. Kido's death greatly angers him to the point he wants to fight against her killer, the Snake Of Clearing Eyes.

:In the official spinoff series "Mekakucity Talkers", the "Trio" of Kido, Kano and Seto appears to now live at the Mekakushi Dan's hideout while both Ayano and Kenjirou are still alive and living at the Tateyama's household (Ayaka Tateyama, however, does not initially appear, and timeline differences seemingly occur in Talkers as well).

:{{voiced by|[[Kana Hanazawa]]}}
:Marry is member No. 4 of the Mekakushi Dan, and the first non-founding member. She is 1/4 [[Medusa]] and has white hair that wiggles when she is happy or frightened and naturally occurring red eyes. Her appearance is that of a teenage girl, but due to her Medusa blood, her actual age is 140 years. Marry is extremely shy around strangers, and will often hide behind Seto, Kido, or Momo. Her songs are {{Nihongo|"Kūsō Forest"|空想フォレスト||"Fantasy Forest"}} and {{Nihongo|"Marry no Kakū Sekai"|マリーの架空世界||"Marry's Fictional World"}}.

:When Marry was younger, she lived in a small house in the woods with her mother, Shion, who was half Medusa. While growing up, she was constantly warned by her mother that should they make eye contact with others, the person would be turned to stone. One day, when she was playing outside against her mother's warnings, she was found and tortured by a group of boys. Shion successfully turned Marry's attackers to stone, but the two were both beaten to death, and were brought into the Heat Haze by Azami, Shion's full Medusa mother (and Marry's grandmother). Upon entering it, Azami planted the snake with the "Combining Eyes" ability, the core of the Medusa, into Shion, who willingly gave it up to Marry so that she could have a second chance at life. As a result, along with the "Eye Contact" ability she had since birth, which allowed Marry to temporarily paralyze anyone she made eye contact with, Marry also acquired the ability to unify all of the "snakes".

:After coming back to life, she lived in isolation for over a hundred years, greatly traumatized by her mother's death and terrified by the outside world. By chance, Seto visited the forest and befriended her, making her realize that the outside isn't so scary after all. He has since managed to bring her to the outside world and invited her to join the Mekakushi Dan.

:After coming to the Mekakushi Dan's hideout and joining the group, she started a side job making fake flowers in her room, which generates a negligible income. She is said to be a ''fujoshi'', or a female who likes [[Yaoi|boy's love]].&lt;ref name="Kagerou Daze Disintegration Book 2012"&gt;Kagerou Daze Disintegration Book (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In Route XX among other "bad end" timelines, Clearing Eyes then kills all the members of the Mekakushi Dan besides Marry, and has her reset the timeline. This happens by means of her Combining Eyes ability, used through her by the snake of 'Clearing Eyes', who "awakens" her&lt;ref name="Kagerou Daze Disintegration Book 2012"/&gt;(often in "Queen" form), and, by "collecting" the snakes that "have lost their owners",&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; she reverses time in order to save everyone. Marry seemingly reverses time at the end of every official "route" and "timeline" seen thus far.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

:In the manga's alternate second timeline only, she was found by Seto years before than in the other timelines and was fostered&lt;ref name="mekakushidan.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/ayano|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[「EDWORD RECORDS」]]|date=September 29, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; temporarily by the Tateyama family. When Ayaka and Kenjirō both died, Marry became completely guilt ridden, believing that her being a "monster" caused the whole tragedy to happen. She also believes she herself is why the relationships between every member of the "trio" (including herself, and Ayano) had been "changing", stating this belief to Seto. Seto encourages her, explaining it's natural for human beings to "change", and implying it's not her fault. This event occurs after a scene in which Marry asks Kano, "do you [[Love|like]] Kido?", comparing Kano's feelings towards Kido and seeing them similar to those relationships seen in her fairy tale books (and claiming she read about it in a book). The specific word she uses in the Japanese edition is "''suki''", often used in romantic situations in Japan and between couples. Though Kano blushes and nervously denies such, Marry continued to press the question until Kano "ran away" to escape. The implication that the trio, Marry, and Ayano were all "changing" indicates that their former relationships had all thus "changed", in some cases drastically (such as their initially kicking Ayano out of the household) and in some cases not (such as Seto viewing Marry as a friend and human being, and the trio and Marry all viewing each other as "friends".).

:It's also revealed in the same alternate second timeline of the manga that Marry's "Queen" (of the snakes) power here causes a great toll on her body as it slowly deteriorates her body to the point she can't move at all, possibly a result of her being more human than Medusa. Despite her cheerful personality, a monologue in the manga implies that while she loves her friends, she harbors a grudge against the world for taking everything from her, reflecting some of the attitudes her grandmother Azami and her mother Shion held towards humanity. She begins to absorb the powers of the snakes of her fallen comrades. The Mekakushi Dan members left, including her, would then attempt to face off against the snake of Clearing Eyes.

:In the official spinoff series "Mekakucity Talkers", the "Trio" of Kido, Kano and Seto appears to now live at the Mekakushi Dan's hideout while both Ayano and Kenjirou are still alive and living at the Tateyama's household (Ayaka Tateyama, however, does not initially appear, and timeline differences seemingly occur in Talkers as well).

However, later on in Talkers Chapter 29, a conversation occurs between Marry, Seto, Kano, and Shintarō as they discuss "siblings". Marry claims she wants a "brother" (or, specifically, an "''[[Japanese honorifics|onii-chan]]''"-like figure), and targets the boys present in her "search" for an "''onii-chan''". Previously during the same chat, Shintarō asks Kano if the Trio were "kind of" like siblings, to which Kano replies saying he doesn't believe he (Kano) has much "''onii-chan'' power" ("big brother power"), eventually implying Shintarō has more of that than he does. Seto would later join in the conversation, agreeing with Kano as well (while also stating Shintarō has the "longest history as an ''Onii-chan''"). The two frequently try to escape becoming Marry's "''onii-chan''", despite the earlier published alternative second manga storyline, and at one point Seto implies Marry calling him "Seto-onii-chan" feels weird ("''Uh, that way of referring to me gives me a weird feeling... I wish you would drop it...''") Eventually, the boys resolve the issue with Marry by them all agreeing they can be "friends" instead of siblings. Marry would later respond stating, "I don't need an ''Onii-chan''. I [want to] go have fun with a friend."

:Though she is referred to as a "[[Gorgon|gorgon]]" in the English localizations of the series, the Japanese translation as well as Jin himself have also referred to her instead being "[[Medusa]]". As well, her name is also frequently romanized as "Mary" and "Marie" in official Japanese materials, such as merchandise. All romanizations, including "Marry" (used in the English localization) are technically correct.

:Marry's "age" Jin would later clarify himself on his official Twitter, stating: "Since she didn't really count it, she herself didn't know her own age. So, on Marry's first birthday at the Mekakushi Dan's hideout, Kano told her that "You'll be the same age as everyone then!!!" while lighting 17 candles on the cake." "The same age as everyone" would refer to the "Trio" of Kano, Kido, and Seto all being around the same age (Kano 17, Kido and Seto 16 "going-on" 17). This exchange would imply Marry's "age" to be seen by her as being "17" as of July 21 (her official birthday). She also celebrates a birthday during the official spinoff series "Mekakucity Talkers", while already living at the Mekakushi Dan's hideout.

:Momo is member No. 5 of the Mekakushi Dan. She is a first-year high school student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mekakucityactors.com/character/005momo.html|title=Character {{!}} 「メカクシティアクターズ」公式サイト|publisher=1st Place|accessdate=September 29, 2018|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the younger sister of Shintarō and a popular [[aidoru|idol]], which greatly disrupts her normal life and causes a lot of stress for her. Unlike her brother, she does badly at school, and is a clumsy yet cheerful girl. Momo's tastes are also shown to be rather strange. Her songs are {{Nihongo|"Kisaragi Attention"|如月アテンション}}, {{Nihongo|"Otsukimi Recital"|オツキミリサイタル||"Moon Viewing Recital"}} (''with Hibiya Amamiya''), and {{Nihongo|"Tomodachi no Uta"|友達の唄|Song of Friends/A Song of My Friend}}.

:When Momo was younger, she was constantly overshadowed by her brother Shintarō causing her to yearn for attention. During a trip to the beach, she drowned in the ocean and was swallowed up by the Heat Haze, along with her father who had tried to save her, and given the snake of "Drawing Eyes", which is capable of catching people's attention regardless of their preferences. At a fairly young age as a Junior High schooler, she gets a job as an idol, but she finds the constant attention and pressure miserable, lamenting that she just wants to be normal. It's here that she meets Kido, who explains the nature of their powers and offers to use teach Momo how to control her Drawing Eyes if she joins the Mekakushi Dan. Momo accepts, to Shintarō's eventual chagrin.

:In the manga's alternate timeline, she becomes the second victim of the Snake Of Clearing Eyes' killing spree, when she is thrown off a tall building by "Hibiya Amamiya" (as taken over by Clearing Eyes). Clearing Eyes (as "Hibiya") gets Momo to follow him when he asks for Momo's (referring to her as "[[Japanese honorifics|onee-chan]]") "help". ("Please help me, ''onee-chan''.") However, it's implied Momo knew something was wrong right away, as she reacts with a firm-looking expression and follows him; and likely recognizing he wasn't using "oba-san" or "Aun" (his "ruder" nicknames and "honorific") for her. This was incorrectly translated in the official English version of the manga; even though in the Japanese version and editions, the different honorifics are clearly displayed (including as [[Kanji|kanji]]). Similar to this, in the novels, another instance occurs: Shintarō recognizes right away Kano is posing as Momo when "Momo" (Kano) doesn't use the Japanese honorific "''onii-chan''" (lit. "big brother") for Shintarō. ("Momo calls me 'onii-chan', ''Kano''.")

:Though the script for Mekakucity Actors introduced her as being "16" years of age, as she is a 1st year high school student&lt;ref name="http://mekakushidan.com/actors/momo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/momo|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[「EDWORD RECORDS」]]|date=October 4th, 2018|accessdate=October 4th, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Japan (the series takes place in "Kashiwa City", and somewhere near [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba Prefecture]]), she can chronologically only be "15" at the current point of the series (August 14th-17th), as she would not have her 16th birthday until the next years' February 14th. The [[Japanese Education|Japanese school year]] begins in April and ends in March; thus, she could only be 15 at the start of the school year with a birthday of February 14th. This inconsistency was acknowledged by the anime staff at an event for fans in Japan, and Momo's canonical grade of "1st year high school student" (10th grade) is stated on the official website.&lt;ref name="http://mekakushidan.com/actors/momo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/momo|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[「EDWORD RECORDS」]]|date=October 4th, 2018|accessdate=October 4th, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She would later be shown as also the correct grade for her "age" range in both the manga's second alternate timeline and the sixth novel ("Over the Dimension"), showing her as a Junior High (equivalent to "middle school") schooler 2 years before the main series begins, when she'd be around 13-going-on-14 years of age and in the 8th grade.

As a human, Takane was ranked second in the country on a game called 'Dead Bullet -1989-' under the name of "Senkou no Maihime" (lit. Dancing Princess of the Spotlight)' and often stayed up late at night playing. This exacerbated her narcolepsy and made her irritable and bad-tempered at school. She died after being poisoned by Kenjirō. Upon entering the Heat Haze, she is given the snake of "Opening Eyes," giving her immortality through the ability to reside in digital objects. After becoming Ene, she was sent to Shintarō's computer in an email from an unknown sender. Shintarō refers to her as a 'virus' as she constantly plays pranks on him by deleting his files and threatening to upload his embarrassing poems on to the internet. Ene joins the Mekakushi Dan after helping to stop a terrorist attack at a local department store with Shintarō.

:In the manga's alternate timeline, she meets Haruka while both are hospitalized, and quickly bonds with him over video games. While she leaves, Haruka remains in the hospital, though she continues to talk to him. Upon seeing his fast friendship with Shintarō, she stops talking to him out of jealousy. Later, she discovers that he had an attack and passed away, and that shortly beforehand he had sketched her in his notebook. It is strongly implied that her regret caused her to commit suicide by jumping off the hospital building, at which point she entered the Heat Haze and became Ene.

:Ene is not given an official age nor a birthday, her "age" being listed in Jin's 2012 "Disintegration Book" as being "''???''". However, Takane was in the same grade as Haruka, who were both a grade above Shintarō and Ayano during high school (when Takane, Haruka, and Ayano were alive, 2 years before the main series begins). Despite rumors of such, Takane was also not given an official age nor birthday in any official canonical source.

:{{voiced by|[[Takuma Terashima]]}}
:Shintarō is member No. 7 of Mekakushi Dan. He is the main protagonist of the story and has an IQ of 168. While he was in school, his intelligence caused him to have an apathetic personality. His songs are {{Nihongo|"Lost Time Memory"|ロスタイムメモリー}} and {{Nihongo|"Tōmei Answer"|透明アンサー||"Transparent Answer"}}.

:After a while, he became interested in the girl who sat next to him in class, Ayano Tateyama. Despite Ayano always acting cheerful and friendly towards him, Shintarō would treat Ayano with something like coldness - though he is also shown to begin to regard Ayano at all, if not fully as a "friend". Ayano appears happy whenever Shintaro regards her. After Ayano's suicide, he falls into a deep depression and becomes a [[hikikomori]] addicted to the internet. A year after, he was "sent" a mysterious "virus" named Ene, and as he was unable to control her actions, his lifestyle was at a loss. After stopping a terrorist attack with Ene, he became involved with Mekakushi Dan. He would later come to possess the "Retaining Eyes", which allow him to remember all of the past (including all other previous routes and otherwise diverging timelines).

:In the songs ("Music Route") Ayano's death results in two possible routes for the Mekakushi Dan, as shown in Lost Time Memory. In Route 1, also known as the Good End Route, Shintarō (often portrayed in a red jersey) goes out and meets the Mekakushi Dan instead of staying at home and mourning Ayano. In Route XX, also known as the Bad End, Shintarō (often portrayed in full black clothing), still mourning over Ayano's death at 18 years old, becomes fed up with Ene and kills her through unknown means, causing him to have a mental breakdown. The main Shintarō dies while saving "Kuroha" (or, Clearing Eyes possessed Konoha) from shooting himself, while Route XX Shintarō commits suicide by slitting his throat with a pair of red scissors. However, all of these events would supposedly lead to Shintarō coming to possess "Retaining Eyes".

:In the manga's alternate first and second timelines, Shintarō is shown to have never met Ayano at all. However, after he dies in the first timeline, a "vision" (or "dream") of "Ayano" appears before him, asking him if Shintarō knew why she died. After injuring himself in the new timeline he is hospitalized beside Haruka Kokonose, who serves the role of causing him to come out of his shell instead (and instead of Shintarō meeting Haruka at school and becoming his, Ayano's, and Takane's classmate). When Haruka's illness causes him to have an attack and pass away, Shintarō breaks down at the loss of his only friend and becomes a hikikomori like in the other timelines. It is later revealed Takane watched some of this happen from mostly afar (while going mostly unnoticed by Shintarō and Haruka, when she tries to visit Haruka's hospital room to see Haruka). Takane would later seemingly commit suicide; becoming Ene, who again enters Shintarō's life, and decides to help him come out of his shell herself this time. Shintarō thus befriends Ene in a much different fashion from before, genuinely viewing her as a friend as time goes on. Together with Ene, Shintarō and her would also play with the younger Junior High school aged Momo (Ene was even who seemed to pick out Momo's "Aun" hoodie). Shintarō also watched over Momo from afar while she was in Junior High school, and as time went on, noticing her strange ability to attract attention even though he didn't understand it well at the time. In the manga's second timeline, he eventually would encounter Ayano again, this time as strangers; who requests his assistance.

:Later on in the manga's alternate second timeline, he would officially join the Mekakushi Dan again. He does so by going to their new hideout, and encounters Ayano. Though Ayano initially tries to point out he doesn't have an eye power to protect himself while seeming [[Love|nervous]] by his presence; Shintarō goes on to explain: he thought, if there was "someone he could save", he'll "keep struggling" to "protect that person", "and that person can be no one else" but Ayano herself. He declares he'll use all of his "life force" to "fight" for her, also declaring, "I'm here to help you!". Ayano responds by blushing terribly in her shock and surprise, and he is accepted into the Dan's hideout.

:In the music video for the "Music Route" song "Additional Memory" (2018), it is revealed Ayano apparently loved Shintarō since the very start all along, saying she didn't want to be "just" "friends". This revelation and seeming realization to herself occurs as she continuously falls from the buildings' rooftop, eventually waking up in the Heat Haze, appearing to herself as a classroom in monochrome colors while warped. Ayano sees the classroom from the sky as well, and seems to come to another realization; later encountering who appears to be Marry (in "Queen" form), while a physical snake (in snake form) appears above a then-leaning Ayano (as she leans in front of the also-kneeling Marry). Ayano would then go on to say (as she falls continuously, and seemingly not in person); "I'm sorry", "''Sayonara''", (lit. "goodbye" or "farewell"), and "Daisuki da yo" (lit: "''I love you''"), to who is indicated to be "Shintarō" (seen as he looked previously in the beginning of the "Lost Time Memory" music video, where he walked with Ayano down the street to their school).

:{{voiced by|[[Misuzu Togashi]]}}
:Hibiya is member No. 8 of Mekakushi Dan. He is mentioned to be mature for his age, and is shown to have an immense crush on Hiyori. In the novels and anime, he joins Mekakushi Dan after being spotted escaping the hospital he was at after an accident. His songs are {{Nihongo|"Kagerou Daze"|カゲロウデイズ||"Heat Haze Daze"}} and {{Nihongo|"Otsukimi Recital"|オツキミリサイタル||"Moon-viewing Recital"}} (with Momo Kisaragi). Though it is not his song, he also appears in {{Nihongo|"Konoha no Sekai Jijō"|コノハの世界事情||"Konoha's World Situation"}}.

:As a sixth grade primary schooler, he is the youngest member of the group, at 12 years old (in "Mekakucity Talkers", he prepares to take Junior High exams, and later meets back up with Hiyori "at school" in what's initially implied to be a post-summer scenario.). He has the "Eye Focusing" ability, meaning he can see distant objects from an aerial view. He is originally from a village in the rural countryside and came with Hiyori Asahina to the city for the summer. He stayed at Hiyori's sister's house for the visit and met Konoha, who was living there at the time.

:Hibiya sees Hiyori die in a traffic accident and somehow becomes stuck in a time loop trying to save her from dying, each time ending with him sacrificing himself to try and save Hiyori. He comes in contact with the Heat Haze and is given the snake of 'Focusing Eyes'.

: In {{Nihongo|"Konoha no Sekai Jijō"|コノハの世界事情||"Konoha's World Situation"}}'s music video in "music route", Hibiya has seemingly "switched" the timeline, and is now the one dying repeatedly; while Hiyori is seen witnessing this, shocked and crying. Konoha tries to reach them both in time, but is unable to, as he is not visible physically at the time. Though they are different "routes", the novels appear to reference a similar event, as well - an upset Hibiya tells Konoha, "''you were just standing there and watching!''". The implication is that Hibiya actually ''could'' see Konoha during this point of time, at least, in the novels timeline. (The song contains the lines, from Konoha's point of view; "With my wobbling see-through body; My hand won't reach them in time.") In the 3rd novel, "The Children Reason", Shintarō even references and repeats the line, when he discusses with Kido the possibility that Hibiya remembers the events of him being in the Heat Haze, both initially concluding that Hibiya ''did'' remember.

:In the music, anime, and novels timeline, during "Otsukimi Recital", Hibiya is depressed because he hasn't been able to save Hiyori. Momo notices his depression, dragging him along to get him to partake in various "fun" events. In the music timeline, this involves things such as eating an extremely large meal (Hibiya only takes a bite), playing games at the arcade (where he slowly begins to seem to have fun), and trying on clothes and costumes (one of which involves Hibiya crossdressing while wearing a maid dress, as Momo gets him to do so.) The two later sit by the curb, where Hibiya's soda hits him in the eyes in a similar fashion to how Momo's own hit hers in "Kisaragi Attention". Momo continues to drag him along; and they reach a park. Hibiya begins to have flashbacks of Hiyori smiling, petting a cat, as Momo does the same thing, albeit getting scratched by one. As he begins crying again, Momo realizes the situation is desperate, and puts on a "recital" before him, encouraging him as her eyes turn red, drawing his attention. The full moon is visible behind them in the music video, relating to the song's title ("Moon-viewing Recital"), while in the anime, they are inside as she gives a performance on stage, again drawing his attention with her red eyes. At the end of the music video, he hesitantly reaches out for what seems to the viewer (and possibly him) as the back of Hiyori's dress; instead, he reaches Momo's hand. The two realize he's holding her hand, Momo getting an increasingly mischevious expression, while Hibiya becomes embarrassed and tries to look away. However, Momo grabs him by the hand and pulls him along happily, Hibiya now seemingly back to "normal". Shintarō watches over them and his sister from afar with a grin (behind a tree), as does Kido, who is also there when Momo awakens after seemingly fainting from using her ability. In the novels, Momo and Hibiya head back. Hibiya proceeds to call Momo by only her name ("Momo"), instead of the rude nicknames he was using for her before (such as "Aun", similar to "auntie", implying she was middle aged, or "old"). Momo had previously requested he stop calling her those, and the fact Hibiya does so implies their relationship became closer, by means of [[Japanese honorifics|yobisute]].

:In the manga's second alternate timeline, Hibiya instead comes out of the Kagerou Daze with the Snake of Clearing Eyes, who proceeds to possess him and hunt down the Mekakushi Dan, after throwing Momo off a building. Clearing Eyes, using Hibiya's body, breaks through a window of the same building, falling far below. Clearing Eyes, still using Hibiya's body, then proceeds to speak to Konoha and the rest, telling them they can't change what is happening. Using Hibiya's body, Clearing Eyes moves towards the nearby street. While Hiyori runs to the scene from afar, Konoha chases after from a closer distance, reaching out with his hand in order to reach Hibiya - only to watch, yet again, as Clearing Eyes, possessing Hibiya, throws Hibiya's body into the street, right in front of the incoming truck. As Hiyori approaches, watching in shock, Hibiya appears to finally regain his consciousness, before he tells Hiyori, "I'm sorry", eyes full of tears.

:Though Hibiya and Konoha were both in front of the truck as it strikes, as Konoha was still reaching out for Hibiya; Clearing Eyes then uses the opportunity to jump to Konoha's body and leaves the scene. On the news Kano watches, three days passed since. Hibiya's corpse, as well as Momo's, were burned and thus unidentified. But since there were other wounds besides those caused by the "accident", there are chances the two were involved in some kind of case. Hibiya's status from then on is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Kagerou Daze Manga&lt;/ref&gt;

:Because Hibiya's birthday is November 4th, and because it would take place before Ayano's birthday of November 22nd, he would be 13 during such a post-summer scenario, such as during the ending of Mekakucity Actors. In comparison, Hiyori's birthday, March 3rd, would place her on the "younger" end of her school year (the [[Education in Japan|Japanese school year]] begins in April and ends in late March.) This is also despite Hibiya and Hiyori's official ages not matching up with a real-world based timeline.

:{{voiced by|[[Mamoru Miyano]]}}
:Konoha is member No. 9 of Mekakushi Dan. Shown to be a rather absent-minded individual, he has a large appetite, similar to his human self as Haruka. His songs are {{Nihongo|"Konoha no Sekai Jijō"|コノハの世界事情||"Konoha's World Situation"}}, {{Nihongo|"Yūkei Yesterday"|夕景イエスタデイ||"Yesterday Evening"}} (as Haruka), {{Nihongo|"Outer Science"|アウターサイエンス}} (as Black Konoha), and {{Nihongo|"Summertime Record"|サマータイムレコード}} (as both, or Haruka).

:As a human, Haruka suffered from an illness which caused him to have "attacks" and collapse, making him have less time to live, hence making him wish for a body that would not be as vulnerable, and hence being placed in a separate class with Takane Enomoto. With the interference of Kenjirō, he suffers an attack and dies, entering the Heat Haze with Takane, and therefore receiving the "Awakening Eyes" ability, which allows him to live in his ideal body. However, instead of being sent back like the others in the Heat Haze, Haruka stayed in the Heat Haze while the Snake of Awakening Eyes inhabits his body as Konoha, attempting to carry on Haruka's wishes of spending time with his friends. After this, the amnesiac Konoha stays at Ayaka's house, where he meets Hibiya and Hiyori and attempts to save them from the Heat Haze.

:Though Konoha is born from such means, he is seen as being overall different from Haruka - Takane even noting such in the anime (and Ene thus calling Konoha "imposter") and is treated as being his own person. He is noted to have an "[[Immortality|immortal]] body".&lt;ref name="Kagerou Daze Disintegration Book 2012"/&gt;

:In "Summertime Record", the "ending theme" for the overall series, Konoha appears to "join" with Haruka's body, disappearing, and Haruka gaining Konoha's same mark on his cheek, as well as a slightly changed look. The specific events that lead to this occurrence were unknown. However, the various other endings show alternative fates for Konoha - in the anime, Konoha appears to disappear, Haruka regaining his physical body (only seen in the shadows, from afar), and Konoha's shadow briefly "seen" (to the viewer) running separately; in "in a Day's", the MX4D short movie, Konoha is instead seen leaving together with the rest of the Mekakushi Dan after they stop the terrorist incident all together (sans Ayano, and with both Hibiya and Hiyori, as well as Ene instead of Takane) only to be implied killed (with the rest) by the hidden bomb underneath the building at the end, Clearing Eyes seemingly never appearing; in the manga's first timeline, he is possessed by Clearing Eyes, and kills the then-formed Mekakushi Dan (sans Hibiya or Hiyori, who were instead unable to enter the mall due to an incident, and left outside of it; only to still have the timeline repeated) very early on; in the manga's second timeline, he is taken over by Clearing Eyes yet again after it leaves Hibiya's body, which Clearing Eyes possessed. In the "Mekakucity Talkers" spinoff, Konoha is again seen still "alive" along with the rest of the Mekakushi Dan (sans Hiyori, and with Hibiya, as well as Ayano and Ene). The implication that Hibiya is studying for Junior High school and later returns to school ("after" the summer would be over, while meeting up with Hiyori "at school") seems to imply Konoha (as Konoha, and possibly not Haruka) as well lives past "an" August 15th-18th in that timeline, if temporarily. However, Talkers would also later (in Chapter 31) bring up the location of the "amusement park" in passing.

:An alternate version of Konoha appears in Outer Science, notably during the "Music Route", called Black Konoha (also dubbed as Kuroha by Japanese fans, {{Nihongo|''kuro''|黒}} meaning 'black'), and kills everyone in Route XX. In Route 1 (notably during "Lost Time Memory", in "Music Route") for unknown reasons, he attempts to shoot himself in the head, only to be saved by Shintarō; "Kuroha"'s eyes widening in shock as he watches Shintarō fall (it is unknown if the one shocked in "Music Route" was Konoha, or Clearing Eyes himself). In the anime, "Kuroha" is revealed to be the snake of 'Clearing Eyes', Kenjirō's eye ability, which has transferred itself to Konoha (termed "forming" in him) and possessed him, believing him to be a stronger vessel.

:Ayano is member No. 0 of the Mekakushi Dan and was the daughter of Kenjirō and Ayaka Tateyama. Shown to be a happy-go-lucky girl with rather poor grades, she was the deskmate of Shintarō, and it is suggested that her poor grades stemmed from her family matters. Her songs are {{Nihongo|"Tōmei Answer"|透明アンサー||"Transparent Answer"}}, {{Nihongo|"Ayano no Kōfuku Riron"|アヤノの幸福理論||"Ayano's Theory of Happiness"}}, and {{Nihongo|"Adishonaru Memorī"|アディショナルメモリ|"Additional Memory"}}.

:In most major timelines after her parents briefly fostered&lt;ref name="mekakushidan.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/ayano|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[「EDWORD RECORDS」]]|date=September 29, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; three young children with red eyes, Kido, Seto, and Kano, she decided to fulfill her role as "big sister" (''"onee-chan"'') by creating the Mekakushi Dan to encourage them. After the death of her mother in a landslide and the discovery that her father was experimenting on her friends in an attempt to bring her back to life, Ayano grew increasingly concerned of the safety of the "trio". She committed suicide by jumping off the roof of her school in an attempt to save her family and friends from the plot of the snake that gives Kenjirō the 'Clearing Eyes.' She gets possessed by a snake and obtains the 'Favoring Eyes,' which allows her to project her thoughts and emotions unto others.

:In the manga's alternate first timeline, she is there with Marry when the landslide happens, now killing both her parents. She receives Favoring Eyes as a result, as well as the memories of Azami. Becoming far more stoic and cynical, she comes to the conclusion that to save the trio from harm, she must kill Marry, the catalyst of the tragedies to come. Kido punches Ayano hard enough to draw blood (reflecting a similar incident from their past when they were younger, and Kido was still new to the household) but Ayano doesn't change her mind. Extremely angered, shocked, and fearing for Marry's well-being and life, the trio then kick Ayano completely out of the house, cutting all ties with Ayano. In turn, she never meets Shintarō or her other school friends, but also doesn't remain trapped in the Daze. Unfortunately, her relationships with all of the trio worsened to an extreme as a result as well. When meeting her again, Kano addresses her extremely coldly as "''o''nee-chan" (formal [[Japanese honorifics|Japanese honorific]], meaning similar to "big sister") instead of "''n''ee-chan" (informal [[Japanese honorifics|Japanese honorific]], meaning similar to "sister"), something he had never done before that. As the manga's storyline continued, many further events would eventually lead to Kano reconciling with Ayano, reinstating her "''n''ee-chan", however, she would be unable to reconcile in person with the already dead Kido, and Seto who was busy at the time taking care of Marry.

:In the fifth novel "The Deceiving", alternative events would again occur from other timelines, in which a young Kano meets young Ayano at the park one day, a short time before he initially dies being killed during a robbery (and before they would have met at her household), and thus meeting as strangers at the park. Ayano swung from the metal bar at the park, only to then have a brief conversation with Kano, in which he didn't reveal his name to her (and she didn't get to reveal hers to him). Kano would then come to mentally describe Ayano as "Park Girl", remembering her to the point of being able to take on her form, including while at the orphanage, before they meet the Tateyamas and Ayano again later on, and again are fostered&lt;ref name="mekakushidan.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/ayano|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[「EDWORD RECORDS」]]|date=September 29, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; temporarily at the household. This event does not seemingly occur in any other timeline but the novels.

:An Ayano that Shintarō meets at some times (in the real world) is revealed to also be Kano (including in the novels) using his "Deceiving" ability, who does so to spite Shintarō, whom he believes caused Ayano's death. However, Kano would later apologize for the incidents in the seventh novel ("From the Darkness") and Shintarō forgives him, genuinely befriending Kano. Kano would go on to believe (thinking to himself) he was no match for Shintarō. Kano also notes to himself Shintarō would "show a different kind of smile" to "Ayano only"; then thinking Shintarō showed "that kind of smile" to Kano himself as well, showing they fully reconcile.

:An Ayano that Shintarō meets in the Heat Haze at other times is revealed to be his own snake, taking on her form wearing her black school uniform, but without her red scarf.

:In the short novel "My Little Daze", an encounter and first meeting with Shintarō at Junior High school 2 years before the main series begins is told through her point of view (as his point of view is told in the drama CD track for the same event). There, she meets Shintarō for the first time in Junior High school. She initially mistakes Shintarō for a girl because of his surname ("Kisaragi") sounding feminine, being slightly shocked when she learns he is a boy. This information is revealed to her through a female teacher at the school, who Ayano speaks with after the teacher notices Ayano in a daze during a ceremony (Ayano herself describing it as a "daze", while she had been imagining what it'd be like to be a "hero", as her father talked of). When the teacher glares at Ayano, Ayano describes it as similar to a "frog that was being glared at by a snake". The teacher lets Ayano go, revealing Shintarō was male, and Ayano would then meet Shintarō in person. Though Shintarō treats her same as he always does at the start, in the drama CD track and short novel, he appears to also be regarding Ayano while doing so. Ayano later asks Shintarō to tutor her, and Shintarō agrees "just for today" after an initial pause. Ayano was "so happy" she "felt like jumping up and down, but figured that was probably a bad idea, and stopped" herself. She asks if they would "finally" "be able to become friends", asks if her "pounding chest" was going to be "able" to "stand this", then concludes, "no", she was "going to be fine". Her father once told her "A pounding chest is the proof of justice", so she was "definitely going to be fine". The entire story from both forms of media appears to reflect the beginning of "Transparent Answer"'s music video in the "Music Route", albeit told in a different way, and with different events and perhaps results. As Ayano also does not mention the "trio" of Kido, Kano, and Seto at all during this entire monologue, it is unknown if they would take the trio into her household in this series of events. Before the series was adapted into other published media such as the manga, novels and anime, Ayano was also never described in connection with the trio until the "Ayano's Theory of Happiness" music video debuted, revealing a connection there, before the anime. She was instead described initially as "taking care of her father and friend", implied to be Kenjirō and Shintarō respectively, during a timeline where only her mother died.&lt;ref name="Mekakushi Dan Official Website"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kagerou Daze Disintegration Book 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daze/Days cd "My Little Daze" Short Story&lt;/ref&gt;

:In Route 1, after Shintarō (in red jersey) meets the real Ayano in the Heat Haze, she passes her eye ability to him.

:In the music video for the "Music Route" song "Additional Memory", it is revealed she apparently loved Shintarō since the very start all along, saying she didn't want to be "just" "friends". This revelation and seeming realization to herself occurs as she continuously falls from the buildings' rooftop, eventually waking up in the Daze, appearing to her as a warped classroom in monochrome colors and covered in flowers. Ayano sees the classroom from the sky as well, and seems to come to another realization; later encountering who appears to be Marry (in "Queen" form), while a physical snake (in snake form) appears above a then-leaning Ayano (as she leans in front of the also-kneeling Marry). Ayano would then go on to say (as she falls continuously, and seemingly not in person); "I'm sorry", "''Sayonara''", (lit. "goodbye" or "farewell"), and "Daisuki da yo" (lit: "''I love you''"), to who is indicated to be "Shintarō" (seen as he looked previously in the beginning of the "Lost Time Memory" music video, where he walked with Ayano down the street to their school).

:She is stated to have initially died during her first year of [[Education in Japan|high school]], when she would still be about 15 years old (as the event of her death happens on August 15th, while her birthday isn't until November 22nd); however, she was also in the same class as Shintarō, being his classmate, thus making them close in age. Since Shintarō (with an April 30th birthday) is already 18 during the main series, Ayano would be 18 post-series (by November 22nd) when "alive" as well. (In the official spinoff series "Mekakucity Talkers", [[Autumn|autumn]] is also implied approaching, in Chapter 31. The format of the real-world [[Education in Japan|Japanese school year]], which begins April 1st and ends in late March, also implies Ayano's age range.)

:He possesses the ability of 'Clearing Eyes' and seems to know about Medusae. When he was in university, he fell in love with Ayaka, who turned him down, not interested in such a pathetic man. This caused him to become much more hard working and taking studying more seriously. After that, he was able to marry Ayaka.

Kenjirō was interested in the theory of Medusae and researched it with Ayaka, only to be caught in a landslide with her and die. He came in contact with the Heat Haze and was possessed by the snake of 'Clearing Eyes'. He became much more engrossed in research after Ayaka's death, eventually experimenting on and killing his two students (Takane and Haruka), this was done while possessed by the snake of 'Clearing Eyes'. His fate is that he dies and reunites with Ayaka in the Heat Haze; in Route XX, the snake of 'Clearing Eyes' (while it is possessing Konoha) kills him.

She drags Hibiya to the city with her in order to get Momo's autograph and stays at her sister's, Ayaka, house. She falls in love with Konoha who was staying there at the time. She becomes involved in a traffic accident and gets stuck in a time loop trying to save Hibiya, but while Hibiya successfully escapes the Heat Haze, she passes away. Despite her apparent pessimistic personality and constant insults she uses towards Hibiya, she truly cares about him. She seemingly thinks of him as an important person; since she never saw her distant older sister before her sister's death; and, because of her popularity that makes it harder for her to be friends with others. She appears in {{Nihongo|"Kagerou Daze"|カゲロウデイズ||"Heat Haze Daze"}} together with Hibiya, who mostly tells the song through his point of view, changing to Hiyori's only in the final verse. She also appears in {{Nihongo|"Konoha no Sekai Jijō"|コノハの世界事情||"Konoha's World Situation"}}, now witnessing Hibiya dying, while shocked and crying. Konoha tries to reach them both in time, but is unable to, as he is not visible physically at the time.

:In the manga's alternative second timeline, she became one of the protagonists. After entering the Heat Haze by what seems to be an "accident", she seemingly gained the 'Focusing Eyes' in Hibiya's stead as he was the one who received the 'Clearing Eyes' instead. Hiyori eventually helps the Mekakushi Dan after the aftermath of the 'Clearing Eyes' incident.

:In the final novel for the novels' timeline ("Summer Time Reload"), Hiyori eventually became an official member of the Mekakushi Dan sometime after the aftermath of witnessing Hibiya dying repeatedly in previous timelines. She is "invited", or "forced", by Ene, who she describes as the "noisy blue girl", to become the now officially "10th" member.

:Because Hibiya's birthday is November 4th, and because it would take place before Ayano's birthday of November 22nd, he would be 13 during such a post-summer scenario, such as during the ending of Mekakucity Actors. In comparison, Hiyori's birthday, March 3rd, would place her on the "younger" end of her school year (the [[Education in Japan|Japanese school year]] begins in April and ends in late March.) This is also despite Hibiya and Hiyori's official ages not matching up with a real-world based timeline.

;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Shion}}|シオン|Shion}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Shion Kozakura}}|小桜 紫苑|Kozakura Shion}}
:{{voiced by|[[Akemi Okamura]]}}
:Shion is a 1/2 medusa and Marry's mother. When Shion was younger, she lived with her parents Azami and Tsukihiko. She loves Marry very much, and in order to protect her she refrains from letting Marry play outside. One day, Marry bypasses her mother's orders and plays outside anyways, however some boys come to attack her. She sacrifices herself in order to save Marry, and uses her eye power to turn the boys to stone; but the strain on her body was too much and she passes away with Marry.

:She gets consumed by the Heat Haze and is given the 'Combining Eyes' ability, however she passes the power on to Marry and sends her to the outside world. Her song is {{Nihongo|"Gunjō Rain"群青レイン||"Ultramarine Rain"}}.

;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Azami}}|アザミ|Azami}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Azami}}|薊|}}
:{{voiced by|[[Satomi Arai]]}}
:Azami is a full medusa and Shion's mother. Snakes grow from her hair, each with a unique power. She once thought humans were 'dull creatures that die easily' but fell in love with a human named Tsukihiko and started a family. After realizing how short human lives were compared to her immortality, she goes away to use the power of the snakes to create a Never Ending World (The Heat Haze) where she could live with her family forever. It is currently unclear if she waited for her family to arrive in the Heat Haze, before realising that her husband would have died by then, or that when she returned, the villagers attacking her house made her revert to her original ideology, causing her to return to the Never-Ending World alone.
:Many years later, her daughter and granddaughter, Shion and Marry were killed on August 15. Knowing this, she was unable to bear her grief and ordered the Heat Haze to "bring in every person who died on August 15", giving the ability of 'Combining Eyes' to Shion to allow her to return to life (who gave it to Marry). This causes her to lose control of the Heat Haze, thus drawing in every person who had died on August 15, the day Marry died, it is presumed that she died due to her power completely taken over by him and eventually suffocating to her death. Her body is later used by the Snake of The Clearing Eyes so that he might able to use her power to find a perfect vessel for him which is Konoha, In the end she finally able to peacefully die with Shion by her side ,finally freed from the torture she's suffering for very many years. Her song is {{Nihongo|"Shinigami Record"|シニガミレコード||"Death-God Record"}}.

;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Ayaka}}|アヤカ|Ayaka}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|}}Ayaka Tateyama|楯山 絢香|Tateyama Ayaka}}
:{{voiced by|[[Mako Hyōdō]]}}
:Ayaka is Ayano's mother, Kenjirō's wife and Hiyori's sister. She became interested in the myth about Medusae and fell in love with Kenjirō at university. She gave birth to Ayano and temporarily fostered&lt;ref name="mekakushidan.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/ayano|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[「EDWORD RECORDS」]]|date=September 29, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kido, Kano and Seto from the orphanage after hearing about their strange abilities. She died in a landslide with Kenjirō while researching, passing on her trademark red clips to Ayano.

;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Tsukihiko}}|ツキヒコ|Tsukihiko}}
:{{voiced by|[[Takehito Koyasu]]}}
:A soldier who fell in love with Azami. Tsukihiko is a white haired, light-eyed man, and has long been considered a "monster" by the other villagers, due to his appearance. He tells Azami that he is also a "monster", and that they should spend their life together. Together, they had Shion and live peacefully until villagers attacked their home, mistakenly thinking he had been held captive. He is referred to by Azami in {{Nihongo|"Shinigami Record"|シニガミレコード||"Death-God Record"}} while also being seen with Azami and the younger Shion together in the music video for the song "Days".

;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Rin}}|リン|Rin}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Rin Kido}}|木戸 凛|Kido Rin}}

:Tsubomi's older sister who died when their family home was burned down. She was directly killed by Kido's biological father, who also set the fire that killed them.

:In "Mekakucity Actors", she would later encounter the young Tsubomi while Tsubomi is in the Daze, surrounded by "fire", Rin "speaking" to Tsubomi.

:While Rin remains trapped in the Daze during most routes, she would also later appear briefly in the novels, as well as being referred to by Kido.

;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Black Konoha}}|黒コノハ|Kuro Konoha}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|}}Snake of Clearing Eyes|目が冴える蛇|Me ga Saeru Hebi}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Mamoru Miyano]]}}
:A snake who, seemingly previously as a "Wide Eyed Snake", suggested to Azami to create the Heat Haze. It is the true antagonist of the series. :Its songs are {{Nihongo|"Outer Science"|アウターサイエンス||}} (as himself) and {{Nihongo|"Dead and Seek"|デッドアンドシーク||}} (''while formed in Kenjirō'').

:In many timelines, it took control of Kenjirō's body and survived under his wish of reuniting with his wife, going to extremes by doing so. Its true goal, however, is living forever. Also in many timelines, it transfers itself to Konoha's body and possesses it, causing Konoha's appearance to change into a "darker" look as well (wearing a full black version of Konoha's clothing, and with black hair).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

:However, in the manga's alternate second timeline, he initially possesses Hibiya Amamiya instead, only body-jumping to Konoha later on (after killing Hibiya, by throwing Hibiya while Clearing Eyes is still using his body into the path of an incoming truck). Konoha was trying to reach Hibiya in time, but is unable to. Though both Hibiya and Konoha are seen in "front" of the truck just before it strikes, Clearing Eyes would then body-jump to Konoha, as the truck kills Hibiya, surrounding them with fire.

:In many timelines, it then kills all the members of the Mekakushi Dan besides Marry, and has her reset the timeline. This happens by means of her Combining Eyes ability, used through her by the snake of 'Clearing Eyes', who "awakens" her&lt;ref name="Kagerou Daze Disintegration Book 2012"/&gt;(often in "Queen" form), and, by "collecting" the snakes that "have lost their owners",&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; she reverses time in order to save everyone. Marry seemingly reverses time at the end of every official "route" and "timeline" seen thus far.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

:However, in the manga's alternate second timeline, Clearing Eyes takes on a new "look" for the first time, discarding Konoha's previous form while still seemingly in use of Konoha's body. On his body, notably his arms and legs, his skin takes on hues of pure black (also coming from the shadows surrounding him) while fading into a dark red [[color gradient]], his eyes being the same glowing dark red. Snake-like skin covers the top half of his face and cheeks, leaving the area around his mouth a light grey. His spiky hair hangs downwards, a large and long piece of which falling between his eyes, while two other equally long strands also frame his face.

:It's also revealed in the same alternate second timeline of the manga that Marry's "Queen" (of the snakes) power here causes a great toll on her body as it slowly deteriorates her body to the point she can't move at all, possibly a result of her being more human than gorgon. Despite her cheerful personality, a monologue in the manga implies that while she loves her friends, she harbors a grudge against the world for taking everything from her, reflecting some of the attitudes her grandmother Azami and her mother Shion held towards humanity. She begins to absorb the powers of the snakes of her fallen comrades. The Mekakushi Dan members left, including her, would then attempt to face off against the snake of Clearing Eyes.

:In the anime's timeline, it is seemingly "defeated" when Kenjirō's wish is granted and it has to comply to Konoha's wish, which was bringing Hiyori back life, so it becomes her surrogate life. It is eventually revealed that he was powered by the souls that were trapped in the haze. The Heat Haze was in fact not only created by Azami, but powered by the "wishes" of people who died on August 14th-15. Anybody who died on those days can't move into the afterlife at all, until someone with gorgon blood (Marry) who can use the Combining Eyes repeats the current timeline. Repeating the timeline in turn (seemingly) stops the haze and frees all of the dead souls that are trapped inside. This appears to permanently weaken the Snake of Clearing Eyes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

:However, the "Kagerou Project Perfect Guide" (2016) would then reveal most "routes", or timelines, are repeated after all; including seemingly the initial anime's.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The MX4D short film's "route" seemingly does not contain Clearing Eyes at all, though it contains very different events from the initial anime's timeline, as the near-full Mekakushi Dan (sans Ayano, and with Ene, Konoha, Hibiya, and Hiyori all together) appear to stop the mall "incident"'s terrorist attack on their own and together, defeating other "new" characters who appear as the terrorists. However, at the end of the MX4D, a bomb is seen at the end, ticking down to zero, and indicating the timeline reset. It is unknown if Clearing Eyes exists in this timeline due to him not appearing physically or being referred to; however, the similar initial events (specifically, the start of the mall incident) may indicate he does. In the novels, it was also revealed he controlled nearly all of the city, including officials.

:In a short manga "Marry no Kakū Sekai" (マリーの架空世界, "Marry's Fictional World"), published near the start of the manga's alternate second timeline, Clearing Eyes faces Marry, who proceeds to use her power to turn him into stone. As she does so, Clearing Eyes, as "Black Konoha", with a bloodied scratch on his cheek and eyes widened in shock, surprise, and possibly even hurt, begins to become stone. However, Marry was later awoken at the Mekakushi Dan hideout by a worried Momo (the trio also being present). Marry would smile through her tears, realizing it was a "dream". This short manga having the same title as the song of the same name, where Marry sings and indicating herself repeating timelines so she can continue to remain with her friends, indicates it may not have completely been a "dream". "Marry no Kakū Sekai" (マリーの架空世界, "Marry's Fictional World") is also included by title at the end of routes similar to "Route XX", especially notable at the very end of the initial music "route", where it is placed after the events of "Konoha no Sekai Jijō" (コノハの世界事情, "Konoha's World Situation") and "Kagerou Daze" (カゲロウデイズ, "Heat Haze Daze") (which occur at the same time as each other), leading into "Outer Science" (アウターサイエンス) and concluding with "Marry no Kakū Sekai" (マリーの架空世界, "Marry's Fictional World") along with a repeat.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

On a normal day, the "country's president" announced that "the world was going to end", but by guidance of her future self (Ene), Takane (as her "Headphone Actor" character) was seemingly successfully able to escape as she still (as later implied in "Yesterday Evening"'s ending) had someone she needed to meet. However, upon reaching her destination, it is revealed to her by clapping scientists that she had "spent" her "life" in a "box". The scientist at her destination (implied to possibly be either Kenjirō, or Clearing Eyes as Kenjirō) congratulates her before "tossing a bomb", bombing the town, and implied killing her.

| ShortSummary=This song has also received a million views on Nico Nico Douga, and is the first IA song to do so. It is also known as {{Nihongo|"Sōzō Forest"|想像フォレスト||"Imagination Forest"}}. It was later "remade" (with slight animation changes and fixes, and an updated ending that now showed Seto's "older" design) as "Kūsō Forest" instead of "Sōzō Forest", but it is still more commonly known by its previous name.

The story of Marry is described, with her living alone and sheltered in a house, longing to go outside. Once, against her mother's warnings, she went out, and was bullied (leading to eventual torture), only to be saved by her Medusae mother who turned her attackers to stone, but died of (seemingly) the stress using her power caused. Later, a younger Seto chances upon her house, and recruits her to the Dan.

An alternate point of view of "Kagerou Daze", this time from Konoha's. He is somehow dragged into the time loop as well, but as he is (seemingly) not meant to be there, he cannot do anything to stop Hiyori and Hibiya's countless deaths and feels helpless about it.

The "Kagerou Project Perfect Guide" (2016) would later re-confirm it taking place alongside "Kagerou Daze" (at the same time) in the "Music Route" timeline.

Kano's song. He begins talking with the listener about a story of a boy who became a "monster" who always lied, being able to even shapeshift into some other forms (such as a female form), but lost sight of his true heart after being buried under so many "lies".

| ShortSummary=The song is the official "ending theme" and last song and music video of the overall project. The song tells what (seemingly) happens with Mekakushi Dan and with the characters after the end of the story.

A seeming "good end", it describes how the Dan comes back together again after everything is over and they have (seemingly) lost their eye powers. However, having grown up and become "adults", they can hardly remember themselves and each other from their times in the Dan anymore. They say goodbye to each other, and if they can remember; maybe they will all meet again.

However, in the "Kagerou Project Perfect Guide" (2016), multiple more "Routes" and otherwise timelines were confirmed; "Mekakucity Actors" (which contained this song) stated to be one of the "Routes", which may have been "repeated" after all; heavily implying more potential "Routes" were to come.

| ShortSummary=The opening theme for the "Mekakucity Actors" anime. It is sung by singer MARiA from GARNiDELiA and composed by Shizen no Teki-P/Jin.

It would later contain a "lyrics" "music video", also illustrated and directed by Sidu, displaying the various characters with stylized lyrics and imagery.

Some in-between frames for the music video give "hints" for the deeper underlying plot of the story.

| ShortSummary=The ending theme for the "Mekakucity Actors" anime. It is sung by Lia, who also provided her voice for the Vocaloid IA, commonly used by Jin to make Kagerou Project songs. The song was composed by Shizen no Teki-P/Jin.

In the ending theme for the anime, illustrated by Sidu, Hiyori Asahina sits alone in a dark subway car, as the rest of the Mekakushi Dan slowly begin appearing around her, everyone in shadows. Most of the members appear to be sleeping, with Shintaro and some others keeping watch. The first one to appear by Hiyori's side is Hibiya Amamiya, sleeping against her in a similar fashion to an earlier scene from the end of "Konoha's World Situation", though the Hiyori here seems less natural, and more composed; a small, peaceful smile on her face the entire time. Konoha, as well, would soon appear sleeping against her other side. Suddenly, everyone around her vanishes, revealing Hiyori appearing to be alone; as she soon quickly fades away herself.

An official music video (also illustrated by Sidu) was also later released, this time showing Azami surrounded by her family, husband Tsukihiko and daughter Shion, in a much brighter looking subway car. However, as the video goes on, "glitch"-like things begin happening, and her family soon disappears. Azami begins crying as the imagery becomes somewhat darker. Suddenly, she opens her eyes, only to see a view of Hiyori Asahina in the subway car, surrounded by her sleeping (or otherwise) friends; the same as shown in the "Mekakucity Actors" ending theme.

It is unknown which one exactly sings the song (and may be both, in their different versions), also as Azami's version referenced the earlier Hiyori's/Mekakucity Actors' version. However, the lyrics appear to relate to both characters.

(The only known ones to do so thus far are: Hibiya, Haruka, and/or Seto.)

It's the second song known of Mekakucity Reload. Before Mekakucity Reload's release, Jin previewed the song on August 15th, 2018; Kagerou Project's anniversary date; personally providing the vocals for the song and playing it himself.

| ShortSummary=It is not yet known if it'll be included on Mekakucity Reload. It was bundled as a "bonus song" with the release of the "Mekakucity Talkers" Volume 1 spinoff book.

Momo Kisaragi sings this song in-character, with a performance provided by her voice actor, Nanami Kashiyama. It is the very first song to be originally shown as sung by a character's official voice actor.

It was officially described by the book's promotions (which were re-tweeted by Jin's official twitter) as being a "love song" sung by Momo Kisaragi.

'''Korean theatre''' is theatre performances were originally done in courtyards although have now moved to stages. It is performed in the Korean language and is generally made up of those of Korean descent. Rising to prominence in ancient Korea, Korean theatre remains vibrant today and is now gaining popularity around the world.

Korean theatre before the 20th century was more 'performance' than 'drama'. There was no plot-driven drama, and all the performative presentations, including dance, shaman ritual, and circus were called ''Nolum'' (놀음) or ''Yeonhee'' (연희), which means 'playing'.
	
Up till the 19th century, the leading form of Korean public theatre was ''[[Talchum]]'' (탈춤) and ''[[Pansori]]'' (판소리). Talchum literally means mask-dance. Multiple players wearing masks performed a loosely fixed text through dance, dialogue and song. Since the performers were able to conceal their identities, many of the plays that were played were satires. Pansori is a form of storytelling. There is one central performer who, through dialogue and song goes through a whole story and another performer who adds rhythm and mood to the story by beating on a drum and putting in verbal sounds (‘chuimsae’-추임새). Neither Talchum nor Pansori had a fixed script – they were handed down orally from generation to generation. 
	
After Korea opened its doors to the foreign countries in the late 19th century, the first modern indoor theater, [[Hyopyul-sa]](협률사) was built in 1902, and the ‘new plays’ (신극) started to come through. ‘New plays’ was the term Korean thespians used for the Western drama at that time. The proscenium stage was introduced as well as Shakespeare, and there was a movement among the theatre practitioners to define a line between the traditional Korean theatre and the new wave. Nowadays the traditional forms are continued by the "living national treasures"; people who are selected by the government for having exceptional skill in a traditional art and are funded to pass it down. 
	
Contemporary Korean theatre has three main directions. First there are the government funded theatres such as The National Theatre and Seoul Performing Arts Center. The main repertory consists of Korean traditional theatre and classics such as Shakespeare and Chekhov. The second direction happens at Daehakro (대학로), the ‘off-Broadway’ or ‘off-off-Broadway’ of Seoul, Korea. Most of the theatre that takes place in Daehakro is independent and experimental. The last but largest direction is that of the popular theatre. Many corporate companies have built big theatre spaces in Seoul that are mainly used to stage big musicals and translations of Broadway hits. But whereas these three categories can give one an idea about contemporary Korean theatre, one also needs to keep in mind that the three often intermingle, so sometimes you find experimental theatre at a corporate theatre and a Broadway musical on Daehakro. 
Korean theatre has spread across the world and is rising to prominence in other countries such as Australia, U.S.A and England. Oftentimes themes include modernized and revised versions of traditional Korean plays mixed with melodrama.

'''''Le Chahut''''' (English: ''The Can-can'') is a [[Neo-Impressionist]] painting by [[Georges Seurat]], dated 1889-90. It was first exhibited at the 1890 [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon de la Société des Artistes Indépendants]] (titled ''Chahut'', cat. no. 726) in Paris, where it eclipsed other works. ''Chahut'' became the prime target of art critics, and was widely discussed among [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolist]] critics.

The painting—representing a [[quadrille]] at the [[Moulin Rouge]]—influenced the [[Fauvism|Fauves]], [[Cubism|Cubists]], [[Futurism|Futurists]] and [[Orphism (art)|Orphists]].

Formerly in the collection of French Symbolist poet and art critic [[Gustave Kahn]], ''Chahut'' is located at the [[Kröller-Müller Museum]] in Otterlo, Netherlands.

==Description==
''Le Chahut'' is an oil painting on canvas measuring 170 by 141&amp;nbsp;cm (67 x 55 in). Seurat employed a [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] style, with [[Pointillism|pointillist]] dots of color. The work is dominated by a color scheme that tends toward the red end of the spectrum, of [[earth tones]] that draw from a palette of browns, tans, warm grays, and blues, interspersed with not just the primary colors (reds and yellows), nor even with the six principal colors, but with eighteen mixtures on his palette prior to application on the canvas (any of which could be mixed with white).&lt;ref name="Herbert, 1968"&gt;Robert Herbert, ''Neo-Impressionism'', The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, 1968, Library of Congress Card Catalogue Number: 68-16803&lt;/ref&gt; A deeper blue border painted around the edge of the canvas culminates in a shallow arch on the upper edge.

''Le Chahut'' is a conspicuous example of Seurat’s pointillist technique. The modulation of light and shadow throughout the work is obtained by the use of small dots of color juxtaposed side by side while alternating in both intensity and concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artandarchitecture.org.uk/images/gallery/6007ba8c.html Art and Architecture, Courtauld Institute of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; The dots are meant to fuse in the eye of the viewer to create the impression of mixed colors when observed from a distance. While the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] had focused their attention on the harmony of colors based on similar or related hues (only partially separated), the Neo-Impressionists harmony had been based on contrasting hues, pitted one against the other; resulting in a vibrating ''mélange optique'' (the optical mixture in the observer's eye).&lt;ref name="Herbert, 1968" /&gt;

The painting is divided into three principal spaces. Musicians occupy the lower left section, one of whom is centrally located, his back turned toward the viewer, with his double-bass erected to the left. A row of dancers, two women and two men with their legs raised, occupy the upper right. They are characterized by curves and rhythmic repetition, creating a synthetic sense of dynamical movement. The background consists of ornate cabaret-style lighting fixtures, and a few members of the audience sitting in the front row, their eyes fixed on the performance. On the lower right another client is staring with a sidelong glance, indicative of sexual desire or sly and malicious intent; the archetype of a male voyeur, often portrayed in mid-century journalistic illustrations of the can-can.&lt;ref name="Herbert, 1991"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=GIC728g8ps8C&amp;pg=PA445&amp;dq=seurat,+Le+Chahut&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCGoVChMI0qGY-LzCyAIVhDIaCh1pYwUD#v=onepage&amp;q=Chahut&amp;f=false Robert L.

==Background==
Chahut (literally meaning noise or uproar) is an alternative name for the [[can-can]], a provocative, sexually charged dance that first appeared in the ballrooms of Paris around 1830. The style of dance caused a scandal due to the high kicks and other gestures of the arms and legs. Leading up to the 1890s, the dance transited from individuals in ballrooms  to stage performances by a chorus line in such places as the [[Moulin Rouge]] in [[Montmartre]].

[[File:Degas - Café Concert - at Les Ambassadeurs 1876-77.jpg|thumb|[[Edgar Degas]],1876-77, ''[[:fr:Le Café-concert aux ambassadeurs|Café Concert at Les Ambassadeurs]]'', [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon|Musée des beaux-arts de Lyon]]]]
:"Compared with Degas's ''Café-concert''", writes art historian Robert Herbert, "the kind of work presaging Seurat's, the Chahut dancers are lined up with the repetitive rhythms of ornamental art. Parallel to the surface rather than spiraling into depth, they tilt or unfold in staccato bursts that fairly jump in our vision. Indeed, ever since the exhibition of ''[[Bathers at Asnières|Baignade]]'' six years earlier, in 1884, Seurat had progressively flattened his major compositions and increased the number of small accents typical of decorative art, such as zigzags, darting curves, flaring rays, repeated parallels, and nonreceding flat zones."&lt;ref name="Herbert, 1991" /&gt;

Seurat focuses on an upward movement of lines throughout the painting—"an extremely complicated machinery of lines" writes art historian [[John Rewald]]&lt;ref name="Rewald, 1943"&gt;[https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1265747W/Georges_Seurat Rewald, John, ''Georges Seurat'', Wittenborn and Company, New York, 1943]&lt;/ref&gt;—giving the illusion of a high-spirited ambience of both dance and music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seurat.krollermuller.nl/en/lechahut ''Le Chahut'' from the Kröller-Müller Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; The caricatural figures are treated stiffly and imposingly, with humor and gaiety.&lt;ref name="Herbert, 1991" /&gt; The anti-naturalist tone of ''Chahut'', with its primacy of expression over appearance and its eloquent use of lines and color, reflects the influence of both [[Charles Blanc]] and [[David Pierre Giottino Humbert de Superville|Humbert de Superville]]. Humbert's theory inspired Blanc's idea that lines (just as colors) induce feelings. The direction of a line changes the expression, and are therefore signs of emotion. Horizontal lines are synonymous with calmness, by association with equilibrium, duration and wisdom, while expansive lines embody gaiety, by virtue of their association with expansion, inconstancy and voluptuousness. ''Chahut'''s voluptuous expression and upward linear schematic embodies the Humbert-Blanc qualities and features of gaiety.&lt;ref name="Herbert, 1991" /&gt;

Seurat makes use, too, of [[Charles Henry (librarian)|Charles Henry]]'s theories on the emotional and symbolic expression of lines and colors, and the works of [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]] and [[Ogden Rood]] on [[complementary color]]s.  Seurat was also influenced by Japanese prints, and the graphic works of [[Jules Chéret]]. While Seurat acknowledges Henry as an influence for his "esthétique", Humbert's and Blanc are not mentioned.&lt;ref name="Herbert, 1991" /&gt; Though in theory Seurat clearly pays debt to his predecessors, in practice ''Chahut'' stands apart. Its forms are not abstract, but schematic and perfectly recognizable as the popular social milieu within which Seurat had been plunged since his move to Montmartre in 1886; with its sexually provocative subject matter (revealing legs and undergarments) inspired by burlesque dancing of Montmartre performers, café-concerts, theaters, ballrooms, music halls, vaudevilles, and fashionable Parisian nightlife.&lt;ref name="Herbert, 1991" /&gt;

Jules Christophe, Seurat's friend who interviewed him for a short biography published in spring 1890, described ''Le Chahut'' as

&lt;blockquote&gt;the end of a fanciful quadrille on the stage of a Montmartre cafe-concert: a spectator, half show-off, half randy investigator, who smells, one might say, with an eminently uplifted nose; an orchestra leader with hieratic gesture, seen from the back; some hands on a flute; and, with partners having serpentine suit tails, two young dancers in evening dress, skirts flying up, thin legs distinctly elevatory, with laughs on upraised lips, and provocative noses. On these working-class parisiennes [parisiennes de faubourgs], Georges Seurat, the painter of these delicacies, nonetheless confers the nearly sacred character of priestesses accomplishing rites... All his paintings offer little more than ascending lines (above the perpendicular [he meant to write "horizontal"]), which, in M. Charles Henry's system, are encharged with expressing gaiety; do they express it?&lt;ref name="Herbert, archive"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/GeorgesSeurat18591891 Robert L.

==Reception==

''Chahut'' was exhibited at the [[Salon des Indépendants]], 20 March–27 April 1890,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k933463t/f40.image Société des Artistes Indépendants, catalogue des œuvres exposées, 6ème exposition, 1890]&lt;/ref&gt; eclipsing his other large entry: ''[[Young Woman Powdering Herself (Seurat)|Jeune femme se poudrant (Young Woman Powdering Herself)]]'', to which critics at the time paid little attention.&lt;ref name="Herbert, 1991" /&gt; ''Chahut'', the larger and more progressively modern of the two, was widely discussed among [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] critics, such as [[Arsène Alexandre]], Jules Christophe, [[Gustave Kahn]], [[:fr:Georges Lecomte|Georges Lecomte]], [[Henry van de Velde]], [[Emile Verhaeren]], and [[Téodor de Wyzewa]]. Two themes stood out: the Montmartre subject matter, and its incarnation of Henry's theories of linear expression. The painting was not liberally praised, as critics perceived its linear composition as overly schematic. Yet due to ''Chahut's'' anti-naturalist elements, its hieratic formalism and ritualistic components, Seurat were seen as an innovator.&lt;ref name="Herbert, 1991" /&gt; Their interpretations unintentionally paralleled the terms and concepts of Charles Blanc, whose anti-naturalist approach continued to inspire Seurat. Blanc commented on Egyptian art with a syntax the Symbolists may have used for ''Chahut'': 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The figures in Egyptian bas-relief, writes Blanc, "are accentuated in a concise, summary manner, not without finesse but without details. The lines are straight and long, the posture stiff, imposing, and fixed. The legs are usually parallel and held together. The feet touch or point in the same direction and are exactly parallel... In this solemn and cabalistic pantomime, the figure conveys signs rather than gestures; it is in a position rather than in action."&lt;ref name="Herbert, 1991" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[John Rewald]] writes of both ''Le Chahut'' and ''Le Cirque'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The figures in these paintings are dominated by monotony or joy (there is no sadness in the pictures of Seurat) and are, of course, governed by strict rules, being controlled by that play of line and color whose laws Seurat had studied. In these canvases Seurat, without yielding in any way to the literary or the picturesque, rehabilitated the ''subject'' which had been relinquished by the impressionists. His works are "exemplary specimens of a highly developed decorative art, which sacrifices the anecdote to the arabesque, nomenclature to synthesis, the fugitive to the permanent, and confers on nature—weary at last of its precarious reality—an authentic reality," wrote [[Félix Fénéon|Fénéon]]&lt;ref name="Rewald, 1943" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1904 Neo-Impressionism had evolved considerably, in a move away from nature, away from imitation, toward the distillation of essential geometric shapes and harmonious movements. These forms were considered superior to nature because they contained ''idea'', representing the dominance of the artist over nature. "Harmony means sacrifice", wrote [[Henri-Edmond Cross]], and much of early Neo-Impressionism was vacated. Cross, [[Paul Signac]], along with [[Henri Matisse]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[André Derain]] (of the younger generation) now painted with large brushstrokes that could never blend in the eye of the observer. Pure bold colors (reds, blues, yellows, greens and magentas) bounced off the manifold of their canvas, "making them as free of the trammels of nature", writes Herbert, "as any painting then being done in Europe."&lt;ref name="Herbert, 1968" /&gt;

The work of [[Paul Cézanne]] had been greatly influential during the expressionistic phase of [[proto-Cubism]] (between 1908 and 1910), while the work of Seurat, with its flatter, more linear structures captured the attention of the [[Cubism|Cubists]] from 1911.&lt;ref name="Herbert, 1968" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mittelmann"&gt;[http://cubism-coldcreation.blogspot.com/ Alex Mittelmann, ''State of the Modern Art World, The Essence of Cubism and its Evolution in Time'', 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Seurat had been the founder of Neo-Impressionism, its most innovative and fervent protagonist, and proved to be one of the most influential in the eyes of the emerging [[avant-garde]]; many of whom—such as [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Gino Severini]] and [[Piet Mondrian]]—transited through a Neo-Impressionist phase, prior to their [[Fauvism|Fauve]], [[Cubism|Cubist]] or [[Futurism|Futurist]] endeavors.

:"With the advent of monochromatic Cubism in 1910–1911," writes Herbert, "questions of form displaced color in the artists' attention, and for these Seurat was more relevant. As a result of several exhibitions, his paintings and drawings were easily seen in Paris, and reproductions of his major compositions circulated widely among the Cubists. The Chahut was called by [[André Salmon]] 'one of the great icons of the new devotion', and both it and the ''[[The Circus (Seurat painting)|Cirque (Circus)]]'', Musée d'Orsay, Paris, according to [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], 'almost belong to Synthetic Cubism'."&lt;ref name="Herbert, 1968" /&gt;

The concept was well established among the French artists that painting could be expressed mathematically, in terms of both color and form; and this mathematical expression resulted in an independent and compelling 'objective truth', perhaps more so than the objective truth of the object represented.&lt;ref name="Herbert, 1968" /&gt;

Indeed, the Neo-Impressionists had succeeded in establishing an objective scientific basis in the domain of color (Seurat addresses both problems in ''Circus'' and ''Dancers''). Soon, the Cubists were to do so in both the domain of form and dynamics; [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]] would do so with color too.&lt;ref name="Herbert, 1968" /&gt;

A '''library''' is a collection of sources of information and similar resources, made accessible to a defined community for reference or borrowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/library|title=Library – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|website=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides physical or digital access to material, and may be a physical building or room, or a virtual space, or both.&lt;ref&gt;"Library ... collection of books, public or private; room or building where these are kept; similar collection of films, records, computer routines, etc. or place where they are kept; series of books issued in similar bindings as set." – Allen, R. E., ed. (1984) ''The Pocket Oxford Dictionary of Current English''. Oxford: Clarendon Press; p. 421&lt;/ref&gt; A library's collection can include [[book]]s, [[Periodical literature|periodicals]], [[newspaper]]s, [[manuscript]]s, [[film]]s, [[map collection|maps]], [[print room|prints]], [[document]]s, [[microform]], [[compact disc|CDs]], [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]], [[videotape]]s, [[DVD]]s, [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray Discs]], [[e-book]]s, [[audiobook]]s, [[database]]s, and other formats. Libraries range in size from a few shelves of books to several million items. In Latin and Greek, the idea of a [[bookcase]] is represented by ''Bibliotheca'' and ''Bibliothēkē'' (Greek: βιβλιοθήκη): derivatives of these mean ''library'' in many modern languages, e.g. French ''bibliothèque''.

The first libraries consisted of [[archive]]s of the [[Writing#The beginning of writing|earliest form of writing]]—the [[clay tablet]]s in [[cuneiform script]] discovered in [[Sumer]], some dating back to 2600 BC. Private or personal libraries made up of written books appeared in [[classical Greece]] in the 5th century BC. In the 6th century, at the very close of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]], the great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those of [[Imperial Library of Constantinople|Constantinople]] and [[Library of Alexandria|Alexandria]].

A library is organized for use and maintained by a public body, an institution, a corporation, or a private individual. Public and institutional collections and services may be intended for use by people who choose not to—or cannot afford to—purchase an extensive collection themselves, who need material no individual can reasonably be expected to have, or who require professional assistance with their research. In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of [[librarian]]s who are experts at finding and organizing information and at interpreting information needs. Libraries often provide quiet areas for studying, and they also often offer common areas to facilitate group study and collaboration. Libraries often provide public facilities for access to their electronic resources and the [[Internet]].

Modern libraries are increasingly being redefined as places to get unrestricted access to [[information]] in many formats and from many sources. They are extending services beyond the physical walls of a building, by providing material accessible by electronic means, and by providing the assistance of librarians in navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of digital resources. Libraries are increasingly becoming community hubs where programs are delivered and people engage in lifelong learning. As community centers, libraries are also becoming increasingly important in helping communities mobilize and organize for their rights. The relationship between [[librarianship and human rights]] works to ensure that the rights of cultural minorities, immigrants, the homeless, the disabled, LGBTQ community, as well as other marginalized groups are not infringed upon as protected in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

Things were much the same in the government and temple records on [[papyrus]] of [[Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref name=Krasner/&gt; The earliest discovered private archives were kept at [[Ugarit]]; besides correspondence and inventories, texts of myths may have been standardized practice-texts for teaching new scribes. There is also evidence of libraries at [[Nippur]] about 1900 BC and those at [[Nineveh]] about 700 BC showing a [[library classification]] system.&lt;ref&gt;''The American International Encyclopedia'', New York: J. J. Little &amp; Ives, 1954; Volume IX&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 30,000 clay tablets from the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] have been discovered at Nineveh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/ashurbanipal_library_phase_1.aspx |title="Assurbanipal Library Phase 1", British Museum One |publisher=Britishmuseum.org |accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing modern scholars with an amazing wealth of Mesopotamian literary, religious and administrative work. Among the findings were the [[Enûma Eliš|Enuma Elish]], also known as ''the Epic of Creation'',&lt;ref&gt;"Epic of Creation", in [[Stephanie Dalley|Dalley, Stephanie]]. ''Myths from Mesopotamia.'' Oxford, 1989; pp. 233–81&lt;/ref&gt; which depicts a traditional Babylonian view of creation; the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'';&lt;ref&gt;"Epic of Gilgamesh", in Dalley, Stephanie. ''Myths from Mesopotamia.'' Oxford, 1989; pp. 50–135&lt;/ref&gt; a large selection of "omen texts" including ''Enuma Anu Enlil'' which "contained omens dealing with the moon, its visibility, eclipses, and conjunction with planets and fixed stars, the sun, its corona, spots, and eclipses, the weather, namely lightning, thunder, and clouds, and the planets and their visibility, appearance, and stations";&lt;ref&gt;Van De Mieroop, Marc. ''A History of the Ancient Near East ca. 3000–323 BC''. Oxford, UK: [[Blackwell Publishing]], 2007: pg. 263&lt;/ref&gt; and astronomic/astrological texts, as well as standard lists used by scribes and scholars such as word lists, bilingual vocabularies, lists of signs and synonyms, and lists of medical diagnoses.

The tablets were stored in a variety of containers such as wooden boxes, woven baskets of reeds, or clay shelves.  The "libraries" were cataloged using colophons, which are a publisher's imprint on the spine of a book, or in this case a tablet.  The colophons stated the series name, the title of the tablet, and any extra information the scribe needed to indicate.  Eventually, the clay tablets were organized by subject and size.  Unfortunately, due to limited to bookshelf space, once more tablets were added to the library, older ones were removed, which is why some tablets are missing from the excavated cities in Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;Weitemeyer, M. (1956). Archive and library technique in ancient Mesopotamia. ''Libri: International Journal of Libraries, 6''(3). 217–238.&lt;/ref&gt;

The library was conceived and opened either during the reign of [[Ptolemy I Soter]] (323–283 BC) or during the reign of his son [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;II]] (283–246 BC).&lt;ref name="unllib.unl.edu"&gt;Phillips, Heather A., [http://unllib.unl.edu/LPP/phillips.htm "The Great Library of Alexandria?".

The [[Library of Celsus]] in [[Ephesus]], [[Anatolia]], now part of [[Selçuk]], [[Turkey]] was built in honor of the [[Roman Senate|Roman Senator]] [[Tiberius Julius Celsus Polemaeanus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Swain |first=Simon |title=Dio Chrysostom: Politics, Letters, and Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |page=57 |isbn=9780199255214 |quote=Nevertheless, in 92 the same office went to a Greek, Ti. Julius Celsus Polemaeanus, who belonged to a family of priests of Rome hailing from Sardis; entering the Senate under Vespasian, he was subsequently to be appointed proconsul of Asia under Trajan, possibly in 105/6. Celsus' son, Aquila, was also to be made suffectus in 110, although he is certainly remembered more as the builder of the famous library his father envisioned for Ephesus. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicols, John 1978 109"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nicols |first=John |title=Vespasian and the partes Flavianae |publisher=Steiner |year=1978 |page=109 |isbn=9783515023931 |quote=Ti.

The library was built to store 12,000 scrolls and to serve as a monumental tomb for Celsus.

Private or personal libraries made up of written books (as opposed to the state or institutional records kept in archives) appeared in classical Greece in the 5th century BC. The celebrated book collectors of [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] were listed in the late 2nd century in ''[[Deipnosophistae]]''. All these libraries were Greek. The cultivated Hellenized diners in ''Deipnosophistae'' pass over the libraries of Rome in silence. By the time of Augustus, there were public libraries near the forums of Rome. There were libraries in the [[Porticus Octaviae]] near the [[Theatre of Marcellus]], in the temple of Apollo Palatinus, and in the Bibliotheca Ulpiana in the [[Trajan's Forum|Forum of Trajan]]. The state archives were kept in a structure on the slope between the [[Roman Forum]] and the [[Capitoline Hill]].

Private libraries appeared during the late republic: [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] inveighed against libraries fitted out for show by illiterate owners who scarcely read their titles in the course of a lifetime, but displayed the scrolls in bookcases (''armaria'') of citrus wood inlaid with ivory that ran right to the ceiling: "by now, like bathrooms and hot water, a library is got up as standard equipment for a fine house (''[[domus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''De tranquillitate animi'' ix.4–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Libraries were amenities suited to a villa, such as Cicero's at Tusculum, [[Gaius Maecenas|Maecenas]]'s several villas, or Pliny the Younger's, all described in surviving letters. At the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]], apparently the villa of Caesar's father-in-law, the Greek library has been partly preserved in volcanic ash; archaeologists speculate that a Latin library, kept separate from the Greek one, may await discovery at the site.

[[File:Ephesus Celsus Library Façade.jpg|thumb|left|Remains of the [[Library of Celsus]] at Ephesus]]
In the West, the first public libraries were established under the [[Roman Empire]] as each succeeding emperor strove to open one or many which outshone that of his predecessor. Rome's first public library was established by [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|Asinius Pollio]]. Pollio was a lieutenant of [[Julius Caesar]] and one of his most ardent supporters. After his military victory in Illyria, Pollio felt he had enough fame and fortune to create what Julius Caesar had sought for a long time: a public library to increase the prestige of Rome and rival the one in Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, L. (2001). Libraries in the ancient world. New Haven: Yale University Press; Ewald, L. A. (2004). Library Culture in Ancient Rome, 100 B.C. – A.D. 400. Kentucky Libraries, 68(1), 9–11;Buchanan, S. (2012). Designing the Research Commons: Classical Models for School Libraries. School Libraries Worldwide, 18(1), 56–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Pollios's library, the ''Anla Libertatis'',&lt;ref&gt;Ewald, 2004, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; which was housed in the ''Atrium Libertatis'', was centrally located near the [[Roman Forum|Forum Romanum]]. It was the first to employ an architectural design that separated works into Greek and Latin. All subsequent Roman public libraries will have this design.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, 2001, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of Rome's civil wars following the death of [[Mark Antony|Marcus Antonius]] in 30 BC, the Emperor Augustus sought to reconstruct many of Rome's damaged buildings. During this construction, Augustus created two more public libraries. The first was the library of the Temple of Apollo on the Palatine, often called the [[Bibliotheca Palatina|Palatine library]], and the second was the library of the ''Porticus of Octaviae''.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, 2001, p. 81; Buchanan, 2012, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Two more libraries were added by the [[Tiberius|Emperor Tiberius]] on Palatine Hill and one by Vespasian after 70 AD. Vespasian's library was constructed in the [[Imperial fora|Forum of Vespasian]], also known as the ''Forum of Peace'', and became one of Rome's principal libraries. The ''Bibliotheca Pacis'' was built along the traditional model and had two large halls with rooms for Greek and Latin libraries containing the works of Galen and Lucius Aelius.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, 2001, p.84; Buchanan, 2012, pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best preserved was the ancient [[Ulpian Library]] built by the Emperor Trajan. Completed in 112/113, the Ulpian Library was part of Trajan's Forum built on the Capitoline Hill. Trajan's Column separated the Greek and Latin rooms which faced each other.&lt;ref&gt;Ewald, 2004, p.10; Buchanan, 2012, p.62; Casson, p.61&lt;/ref&gt; The structure was approximately fifty feet high with the peak of the roof reaching almost seventy feet.&lt;ref&gt;Houston, G. W. (2008). ''Tiberius and the Libraries: Public Book Collections and Library Buildings in the Early Roman Empire''. Libraries &amp; the Cultural Record, 43, 247–269.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Greek libraries, readers had direct access to the scrolls, which were kept on shelves built into the walls of a large room. Reading or copying was normally done in the room itself. The surviving records give only a few instances of lending features. Most of the large [[Thermae|Roman baths]] were also cultural centres, built from the start with a library, a two-room arrangement with one room for Greek and one for Latin texts.

Libraries were filled with [[scroll|parchment scrolls]] as at [[Library of Pergamum]] and on [[papyrus]] scrolls as at [[Alexandria]]: the export of prepared writing materials was a staple of commerce. There were a few institutional or royal libraries which were open to an educated public (such as the Serapeum collection of the [[Library of Alexandria]], once the largest [[List of libraries in the ancient world|library in the ancient world]]),&lt;ref name="unllib.unl.edu"/&gt; but on the whole collections were private. In those rare cases where it was possible for a scholar to consult library books, there seems to have been no direct access to the stacks. In all recorded cases, the books were kept in a relatively small room where the staff went to get them for the readers, who had to consult them in an adjoining hall or covered walkway. Most of the works in catalogs were of a religious nature, such as volumes of the Bible or religious service books. "In a number of cases the library was entirely theological and liturgical, and in the greater part of the libraries the non-ecclesiastical content did not reach one third of the total"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Beddie, J. (1930). The Ancient Classics in the Mediaeval Libraries. ''Speculum'', 5(1), 3–20. {{doi|10.2307/2846353}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these types of works, in some libraries during that time Plato was especially popular. In the early Middle Ages, Aristotle was more popular. Additionally, there was quite a bit of censoring within libraries of the time; many works that were "scientific and metaphysical" were not included in the majority of libraries during that time period.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Latin authors were better represented within library holdings and Roman works were less represented. Cicero was also an especially popular author along with the histories of Sallust.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, Virgil was universally represented at most of the medieval libraries of the time. One of the most popular was Ovid, mentioned by approximately twenty French catalogues and nearly thirty German ones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Surprisingly, old Roman textbooks on grammar were still being used at that time.

[[Han Chinese]] scholar [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]] established the first library classification system during the [[Han dynasty]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Late Antiquity===
[[File:Bibl. Malatestiana 3.jpg|thumb|[[Malatestiana Library]] of [[Cesena]], the first [[Europe]]an civic library&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stradavinisaporifc.it/cesena.asp |title=Stradavinisaporifc.it |publisher=Stradavinisaporifc.it |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the Late Antiquity and Middle Ages periods, there was no Rome of the kind that ruled the Mediterranean for centuries and spawned the culture that produced twenty-eight public libraries in the ''urbs Roma''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernhard Bischoff|Bischoff, B.]] and [[Michael Gorman (librarian)|Gorman, M.]] (1994). ''Manuscripts and libraries in the age of Charlemagne''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The empire had been divided then later re-united again under [[Constantine the Great]] who moved the capital of the [[Roman Empire]] in 330 AD to the city of Byzantium which was renamed [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, K. K. (2004). ''The history of the library in Western civilization''. New Castle, Del.: Oak Knoll Press, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman intellectual culture that flourished in ancient times was undergoing a transformation as the academic world moved from laymen to Christian clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; As the West crumbled, books and libraries flourished and flowed east toward the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 2009, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; There, four different types of libraries were established: imperial, patriarchal, monastic, and private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Papademetriou | first1 = G. C. | year = 2000 | title = The Patriarchal libraries of Constantinople | url = | journal = Greek Orthodox Theological Review | volume = 45 | issue = 1–4| pages = 171–190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each had its own purpose and, as a result, their survival varied.

Christianity was a new force in Europe and many of the faithful saw Hellenistic culture as pagan. As such, many classical Greek works, written on scrolls, were left to decay as only Christian texts were thought fit for preservation in a codex, the progenitor of the modern book.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, M. (2011). ''Books: A living history''. London: Thames and Hudson, pp.&amp;nbps;35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;   In the East, however, this was not the case as many of these classical Greek and Roman texts were copied.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 2009, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; "[F]ormerly paper was rare and expensive, so every spare page of available books was pressed into use. Thus a seventeenth-century edition of the Ignatian epistles, in Mar Saba, had copied onto its last pages, probably in the early eighteenth century, a passage allegedly from the letters of Clement of Alexandria".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M. (1960). Monasteries and Their Manuscripts. Archaeology, 13(3), 172–177. {{JSTOR|41663782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Old manuscripts were also used to bind new books because of the costs associated with paper and also because of the scarcity of new paper.

In Byzantium, much of this work devoted to preserving Hellenistic thought in codex form was performed in [[scriptorium]]s by monks.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, H. A. (2010). The genesis of monastic libraries. ''[[Libraries &amp; the Cultural Record]]'', 45(3), 320–332, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; While '''monastic library''' scriptoriums flourished throughout the East and West, the rules governing them were generally the same.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 2009; Peterson, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Barren and sun-lit rooms (because candles were a source of fire) were major features of the scriptorium that was both a model of production and monastic piety.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 2009, pp. 36, −38&lt;/ref&gt; Monks scribbled away for hours a day, interrupted only by meals and prayers.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 2009, p.36&lt;/ref&gt; With such production, medieval monasteries began to accumulate large libraries. These libraries were devoted solely to the education of the monks and were seen as essential to their spiritual development.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, 2010, p.329&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of these texts that were produced were Christian in nature, many monastic leaders saw common virtues in the Greek classics. As a result, many of these Greek works were copied, and thus saved, in monastic scriptoriums.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, 2010, pp. 330–331&lt;/ref&gt;

When Europe passed into the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], Byzantine scriptoriums laboriously preserved Greco-Roman classics. As a result, Byzantium revived Classical models of education and libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J.W. (1957). The medieval library. New York: Hafner Publishing Co., p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Imperial Library of Constantinople]] was an important depository of ancient knowledge. Constantine himself wanted such a library but his short rule denied him the ability to see his vision to fruition. His son [[Constantius II]] made this dream a reality and created an '''imperial library''' in a portico of the royal palace.&lt;ref name="Thompson, 1957, p. 312"&gt;Thompson, 1957, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; He ruled for 24 years and accelerated the development of the library and the intellectual culture that came with such a vast accumulation of books.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantius II appointed [[Themistius]], a pagan philosopher and teacher, as chief architect of this library building program. Themistius set about a bold program to create an imperial public library that would be the centerpiece of the new intellectual capital of [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Stoikos, 2007, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Classical authors such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Demosthenes]], [[Isocrates]], [[Thucydides]], [[Homer]], and [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]] were sought. Themeistius hired calligraphers and craftsman to produce the actual codices. He also appointed educators and created a university-like school centered around the library.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Constantius II, [[Julian (emperor)|Julian the Apostate]], a bibliophile intellectual, ruled briefly for less than three years. Despite this, he had a profound impact on the imperial library and sought both Christian and pagan books for its collections.&lt;ref name="Thompson, 1957, p. 312"/&gt; Later, the [[Valens|Emperor Valens]] hired Greek and Latin scribes full-time with funds from the royal treasury to copy and repair manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 1957, pp. 312–313&lt;/ref&gt;

At its height in the 5th century, the Imperial Library of [[Constantinople]] had 120,000 volumes and was the largest library in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 1957, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; A fire in 477 consumed the entire library but it was rebuilt only to be burned again in 726, 1204, and in 1453 when [[Fall of Constantinople|Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hillerbrand|first1=Hans J.|title=On Book Burnings and Book Burners: Reflections on the Power (and Powerlessness) of Ideas|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|date=2006|volume=74|issue=3|pages=593–614|doi=10.1093/jaarel/lfj117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patriarchal libraries''' fared no better, and sometimes worse, than the Imperial Library. The Library of the Patriarchate of Constantinople was founded most likely during the reign of Constantine the Great in the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; As a theological library, it was known to have employed a [[library classification]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; It also served as a repository of several [[ecumenical council]]s such as the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]], [[Council of Ephesus]], and the [[Council of Chalcedon]]. The library, which employed a librarian and assistants, may have been originally located in the Patriarch's official residence before it was moved to the Thomaites Triclinus in the 7th century. While much is not known about the actual library itself, it is known that many of its contents were subject to destruction as religious in-fighting ultimately resulted in [[book burning]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, small '''private libraries''' existed. Many of these were owned by church members and the aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, p.429&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers also were known to have small personal libraries as well as wealthy bibliophiles who could afford the highly ornate books of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 1957, pp.313–314&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, in the 6th century, at the close of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]], the great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those of Constantinople and [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina|Alexandria]]. [[Cassiodorus]], minister to Theodoric, established a monastery at Vivarium in the toe of Italy (modern Calabria) with a library where he attempted to bring Greek learning to Latin readers and preserve texts both sacred and secular for future generations. As its unofficial librarian, Cassiodorus not only collected as many manuscripts as he could, he also wrote treatises aimed at instructing his monks in the proper uses of reading and methods for copying texts accurately. In the end, however, the library at Vivarium was dispersed and lost within a century.

Through [[Origen]] and especially the scholarly presbyter [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]], an avid collector of books of Scripture, the theological school of Caesarea won a reputation for having the [[Theological Library of Caesarea Maritima|most extensive ecclesiastical library of the time]], containing more than 30,000 manuscripts: [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil the Great]], [[Jerome]], and others came and studied there.

===Islamic lands===
[[File:Chinguetti-biblio.jpg|thumb|Inside a Qur'anic Library in [[Chinguetti]], Mauritania]]
By the 8th century, first [[Iran]]ians and then [[Arabs]] had imported the craft of [[papermaking]] from China, with a [[paper mill]] already at work in [[Baghdad]] in 794. Early paper was called bagdatikos, meaning "from Baghdad", because it was introduced to the west mainly by this city.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, S. (2009). The library : an illustrated history. New York, NY : [[Skyhorse Pub.]] ; Chicago : ALA Editions, 2009. p.&amp;nbps;57&lt;/ref&gt; By the 9th century, [[Public library|public libraries]] started to appear in many Islamic cities. They were called "house of knowledge" or ''dar al-'ilm''. They were each endowed by [[Islam]]ic sects with the purpose of representing their tenets as well as promoting the dissemination of secular knowledge. The 9th-century [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] [[Caliphate|Caliph]] [[al-Mutawakkil]] of [[Iraq]], ordered the construction of a "zawiyat qurra"&amp;nbsp;– an enclosure for readers which was "lavishly furnished and equipped". In [[Shiraz]], Adhud al-Daula (d. 983) set up a library, described by the medieval historian, [[al-Muqaddasi]], as "a complex of buildings surrounded by gardens with lakes and waterways. The buildings were topped with domes, and comprised an upper and a lower story with a total, according to the chief official, of 360 rooms.... In each [[Departmentalization|department]], [[Library catalog|catalogues]] were placed on a shelf... the rooms were furnished with carpets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Al-Muqaddasi: Ahsan al-Taqasim |editor=Goeje, M. J. de |year=1906 |encyclopedia=Bibliotheca geographorum Arabicorum |language=Arabic |volume=III |publisher=E. J. Brill |location=Leiden |pages=449}}&lt;/ref&gt; The libraries often employed translators and copyists in large numbers, in order to render into [[Arabic]] the bulk of the available [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], Roman and [[Sanskrit]] non-fiction and the classics of literature.

Organization was a strength of Islamic Libraries during the Golden Age (7th–14th century). In this period, books were organized by subject.  Within the subject, the materials were further organized by when the libraries gained the item, not by last name of the author or the title of the book. Also, Islamic libraries may be the first to have implemented a catalogue of owned materials. The content of a bookshelf was recorded on paper and attached to the end of shelf.
Arab-Islamic people also were very favorable of public knowledge. Public libraries were very popular along with mosque, private, and academic libraries. Instead of being available to the elite of society, such as caliphs and princes, information was something that was offered to everyone.  Some of the libraries were said to let patrons check out up to 200 items. These buildings were also made for comfort of the readers and information seekers. It was said that the rooms had carpets for sitting and reading comfortably. Also, openings such as doors and windows were secured closed as to protect patrons against cold drafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elayyan|first1=Ribhi Mustafa|title=The history of the Arabic-Islamic Libraries: 7th to 14th Centuries|journal=International Library Review|date=1990|volume=22|issue=2|pages=119–135|doi=10.1016/0020-7837(90)90014-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This flowering of Islamic learning ceased centuries later when learning began declining in the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], after many of these libraries were destroyed by [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol invasions]]. Others were victim of wars and religious strife in the Islamic world. However, a few examples of these medieval libraries, such as the libraries of [[Chinguetti]] in [[West Africa]], remain intact and relatively unchanged. Another ancient library from this period which is still operational and expanding is the [[Central Library of Astan Quds Razavi]] in the Iranian city of [[Mashhad]], which has been operating for more than six centuries.

The contents of these Islamic libraries were copied by Christian monks in Muslim/Christian border areas, particularly Spain and Sicily. From there they eventually made their way into other parts of Christian [[Europe]]. These copies joined works that had been preserved directly by Christian monks from Greek and Roman originals, as well as copies Western Christian monks made of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] works. The resulting conglomerate libraries are the basis of every modern library today.

[[Buddhist texts|Buddhist scriptures]], educational materials, and histories were stored in libraries in pre-modern [[Southeast Asia]]. In [[Myanmar|Burma]], a royal library called the [[Pitakataik]] was legendarily founded by King [[Anawrahta]];&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zoq_TtEN54IC&amp;pg=PA29 International dictionary of library histories]'', 29&lt;/ref&gt; in the 18th century, British envoy [[Michael Symes (diplomat)|Michael Symes]], on visiting this library, wrote that "it is not improbable that his Birman majesty may possess a more numerous library than any potentate, from the banks of the Danube to the borders of China". In Thailand, libraries called [[ho trai]] were built throughout the country, usually on stilts above a pond to prevent bugs from eating at the books.

[[File:Flickr - dlisbona - Old Koran manuscript, Alexandria library.jpg|thumb|Qur'an manuscript on display at the [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]]]]
The centrality of the [[Quran|Qurʾān]] as the prototype of the written word in [[Islam]] bears significantly on the role of books within its intellectual tradition and educational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nasr |first1=Seyyed Hossein |year=1992 |title=Oral Transmission and The Book in Islamic Education: The Spoken and The Written Word |journal=Journal of Islamic Studies |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |doi=10.1093/jis/3.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early impulse in Islam was to manage reports of events, key figures and their sayings and actions.

Upon the spread of Islam, libraries in [[Islamic Golden Age|newly Islamic lands]] knew a brief period of expansion in the Middle East, [[North Africa]], [[Sicily]], and [[Spain]]. Like the Christian libraries, they mostly contained books which were made of [[paper]], and took a [[codex]] or modern form instead of scrolls; they could be found in mosques, private homes, and universities, from [[Timbuktu]] to [[Afghanistan]] and modern day [[Pakistan]]. In [[Aleppo]], for example, the largest and probably the oldest mosque library, the Sufiya, located at the city's Grand Umayyad Mosque, contained a large book collection of which 10,000 volumes were reportedly bequeathed by the city's most famous ruler, Prince Sayf al-Dawla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sibai |first=Mohamed Makki |title=Mosque libraries: An Historical Study |year=1987 |publisher=Mansell Publishing Limited |page=71 |isbn=978-0-7201-1896-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn al-Nadim]]'s bibliography ''Fihrist'' demonstrates the devotion of medieval Muslim scholars to books and reliable sources; it contains a description of thousands of books circulating in the Islamic world circa 1000, including an entire section for books about the doctrines of other religions. Modern Islamic libraries for the most part do not hold these antique books; many were lost, [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|destroyed by Mongols]],&lt;ref&gt;Chief among the libraries destroyed by the Mongol hordes was that of the Shia Ismaili Muslim community who occupied a network of mountain fortresses – lead from the castle of Alamut – beginning from the end of the eleventh century to about 1256. "The Fatimids and their successors at Alamut were great lovers and patrons of books, and their vast libraries attracted scholars of every creed from far and wide. The Imam al-Hakim even provided ink, pens, paper, and inkstands free of charge for all who sought learning in the 'House of Knowledge' (dār al-ʿilm). We can only imagine the horror the Ismailis would have felt when they witnessed the destruction of the literary legacy they had so painstakingly fostered. Al-Maqrizi (d.845/1442) describes how great hills of ashes were formed when the slaves and maids of the Luwata Berber tribe burned the Fatimid books.

===European Middle Ages===

In the [[Early Middle Ages]], monastery libraries developed, such as the important one at the [[Monte Cassino|Abbey of Montecassino]] in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.crossingitaly.net/travel/936/montecassino-one-of-the-most-important-libraries-in-the-world/ |title=Montecassino, one of the most important libraries in the world |website=crossingitaly.net |year=2012 |accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Books were usually [[chained library|chained to the shelves]], reflecting the fact that [[manuscript]]s, which were created via the labour-intensive process of hand copying, were valuable possessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jM-OY0LCHCEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Chained+libraries#v=onepage&amp;q=Chained%20libraries&amp;f=false |title=The Chained Library |first=Burnett Hillman |last=Streeter |authorlink=Burnett Hillman Streeter |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=10 March 2011 |accessdate=6 March 2012|isbn=9781108027892 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This hand-copying was often accomplished by travelling monks who made the treks to the sources of knowledge and illumination they sought for learning or to copy the manuscripts held by other monasteries for their own monastic libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Books: A Living History |last=Lyons |first=Martyn |publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum |year=2011 |isbn= |location=Los Angeles, CA |pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this protectiveness, many libraries loaned books if provided with security deposits (usually money or a book of equal value). Lending was a means by which books could be copied and spread. In 1212, the council of Paris condemned those monasteries that still forbade loaning books, reminding them that lending is "one of the chief works of mercy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Putnam |first=Geo. Haven |title=Books and Their Makers in the Middle Ages |year=1962 |publisher=Hillary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early libraries located in monastic [[cloister]]s and associated with [[scriptorium|scriptoria]] were collections of lecterns with books chained to them. Shelves built above and between back-to-back lecterns were the beginning of [[Bookcase|bookpresses]]. The chain was attached at the fore-edge of a book rather than to its spine. Book presses came to be arranged in [[carrel desk|carrels]] (perpendicular to the walls and therefore to the windows) in order to maximize lighting, with low bookcases in front of the windows. This "stall system" (i.e. fixed bookcases perpendicular to exterior walls pierced by closely spaced windows) was characteristic of English institutional libraries. In European libraries, bookcases were arranged parallel to and against the walls. This "wall system" was first introduced on a large scale in Spain's [[El Escorial]].

Also, in [[Eastern Christianity]] monastery libraries kept important manuscripts. The most important of them were the ones in the monasteries of [[Mount Athos]] for [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], and the library of the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]], [[Egypt]] for the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]].

===Renaissance===
[[File:Biblioteca medicea laurenziana interno 01.JPG|thumb|Reading room of the [[Laurentian Library]]]]
From the 15th century in central and northern Italy, libraries of [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] and their enlightened patrons provided a nucleus around which an "[[academy]]" of scholars congregated in each Italian city of consequence. [[Malatesta Novello]], [[Signoria|lord]] of [[Cesena]], founded the [[Malatestiana Library]]. [[Cosimo de' Medici]] in [[Florence]] established his own collection, which formed the basis of the [[Laurentian Library]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-magazine.com/libraries.html Survivor: the History of the Library], history-magazine.com&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome, the papal collections were brought together by [[Pope Nicholas V]], in separate Greek and Latin libraries, and housed by [[Pope Sixtus IV]], who consigned the [[Vatican Library|Bibliotheca Apostolica Vaticana]] to the care of his librarian, the humanist [[Bartolomeo Platina]] in February 1475.&lt;ref&gt;This section on Roman Renaissance libraries follows Kenneth M. Setton, "From Medieval to Modern Library" ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' '''104'''.4, Dedication of the APS Library Hall, Autumn General Meeting, November 1959 (August 1960:371–390) p. 372 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, [[Pope Sixtus V|Sixtus V]] bisected Bramante's [[Cortile del Belvedere]] with a cross-wing to house the Apostolic Library in suitable magnificence. The 16th and 17th centuries saw other privately endowed libraries assembled in Rome: the [[Biblioteca Vallicelliana|Vallicelliana]], formed from the books of Saint [[Philip Neri|Filippo Neri]], with other distinguished libraries such as that of [[Caesar Baronius|Cesare Baronio]], the [[Biblioteca Angelica]] founded by the Augustinian [[Angelo Rocca]], which was the only truly public library in Counter-Reformation Rome; the Biblioteca Alessandrina with which [[Pope Alexander VII]] endowed the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]]; the [[Biblioteca Casanatense]] of the Cardinal [[Girolamo Casanata]]; and finally the Biblioteca Corsiniana founded by the bibliophile [[Pope Clement XII|Clement XII Corsini]] and his nephew Cardinal Neri Corsini, still housed in Palazzo Corsini in via della Lungara. The [[Republic of Venice]] patronized the foundation of the [[Biblioteca Marciana]], based on the library of Cardinal [[Basilios Bessarion]]. In Milan, Cardinal [[Federico Borromeo]] founded the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]].

This trend soon spread outside of Italy, for example [[Louis III, Elector Palatine]] founded the [[Bibliotheca Palatina]] of [[Heidelberg]].

These libraries don't have as many volumes as the modern libraries. However, they keep many valuable manuscripts of Greek, Latin, and Biblical works.

[[Tian Yi Ge|Tianyi Chamber]], founded in 1561 by Fan Qin during the [[Ming dynasty]], is the oldest existing library in China. In its heyday, it boasted a collection of 70,000 volumes of antique books.

===Enlightenment era libraries===
[[File:Thomas Bodley.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Thomas Bodley]] founded the [[Bodleian Library]] in 1602 as an early public library.]]

[[File:Long Room Interior, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|The Long Room of the early 18th century [[Trinity College Library]] in Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland]]

At the start of the 18th century, libraries were becoming increasingly public and were more frequently lending libraries. The 18th century saw the switch from closed parochial libraries to lending libraries. Before this time, public libraries were parochial in nature and libraries frequently chained their books to desks.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966) ''Early Public Libraries: a history of public libraries in Great Britain before 1850'' London: Library Association; p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Libraries also were not uniformly open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Predeek, Albert (1947) ''A History of Libraries in Great Britain and North America''. Chicago: American Library Association; p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the [[British Museum]] existed at this time and contained over 50,000 books, the national library was not open to the public, or even to a majority of the population. Access to the Museum depended on passes, of which there was sometimes a waiting period of three to four weeks. Moreover, the library was not open to browsing. Once a pass to the library had been issued, the reader was taken on a tour of the library. Many readers complained that the tour was much too short.&lt;ref&gt;Battles, Matthew (2003) ''Library: an unquiet history''; p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subscription libraries====
{{main|Subscription library}}
[[File:The North Prospect of Mountague House JamesSimonc1715.jpg|thumb|right|The [[British Museum]] was established in 1751 and had a library containing over 50,000 books.]]
At the start of the 19th century, there were virtually no public libraries in the sense in which we now understand the term i.e. libraries provided from public funds and freely accessible to all.&lt;ref name="Kelly, Thomas 1966; p. 185"&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Only one important library in Britain, namely [[Chetham's Library]] in Manchester, was fully and freely accessible to the public.&lt;ref name="Kelly, Thomas 1966; p. 185"/&gt; However, there had come into being a whole network of library provision on a private or institutional basis.

The increase in secular literature at this time encouraged the spread of lending libraries, especially the commercial [[subscription library|subscription libraries]]. Many small, private book clubs evolved into subscription libraries, charging high annual fees or requiring subscribing members to purchase shares in the libraries. The materials available to subscribers tended to focus on particular subject areas, such as [[biography]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[theology]], and [[travel]], rather than works of fiction, particularly the novel.

Unlike a [[public library]], access was often restricted to members. Some of the earliest such institutions were founded in late 17th century England, such as [[Chetham's Library]] in 1653, [[Innerpeffray Library]] in 1680, and [[Thomas Plume|Thomas Plume's Library]] in 1704. In the [[Colonial history of the United States|American colonies]], the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]] was started in 1731 by [[Benjamin Franklin]] in Philadelphia.

Parochial libraries attached to Anglican parishes or Nonconformist chapels in Britain emerged in the early 18th century, and prepared the way for local public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;George Clark, ''The Later Stuarts: 1616–1714'' (2nd ed. 1956) p 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing production and demand for fiction promoted by commercial markets led to the rise of [[circulating library|circulating libraries]], which met a need that subscription libraries did not fulfil. William Bathoe claimed that his commercial venture was "the Original Circulating library", opening doors at two locations in London in 1737.&lt;ref name=Raven&gt;Raven, James. "Libraries for sociability: the advance of subscription library." The Cambridge History Of Libraries In Britain And Ireland. 3 vols. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=picture1807&gt;{{cite book |last=Feltham |first=John |authorlink=John Feltham |title=Picture of London, for 1807 |publisher=Richard Phillips |edition=8th |location=London |chapter=Circulating Libraries |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=j9MHAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA318 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Circulating libraries also charged subscription fees to users and offered serious subject matter as well as the popular novels, thus the difficulty in clearly distinguishing circulating from subscription libraries.&lt;ref name=Eliot&gt;Eliot, Simon. "Circulating libraries in the Victorian age and after." The Cambridge History Of Libraries In Britain And Ireland. 3 vols. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006, pp. 125–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vogel Załuski Library.jpg|thumb|left|[[Załuski Library|Biblioteka Załuskich]], built in [[Warsaw]] in the mid 18th century]]
Subscription libraries were democratic in nature; created by and for communities of local subscribers who aimed to establish permanent collections of books and reading materials, rather than selling their collections annually as the circulating libraries tended to do, in order to raise funds to support their other commercial interests. Even though the subscription libraries were often founded by reading societies, committees, elected by the subscribers, chose books for the collection that were general, rather than aimed at a particular religious, political or professional group. The books selected for the collection were chosen because they would be mutually beneficial to the shareholders. The committee also selected the librarians who would manage the circulation of materials.&lt;ref name=Forster&gt;Forster, Geoffrey, and Alan Bell. "The subscription libraries and their members." The Cambridge History of Libraries in Britain And Ireland. 3 vols. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;147–148.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, there were more than 200 commercial circulating libraries open in 1800, more than twice the number of subscription and private proprietary libraries that were operating at the same time.  Many proprietors pandered to the most fashionable clientele, making much ado about the sort of shop they offered, the lush interiors, plenty of room and long hours of service.&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt; "These 'libraries' would be called rental collections today."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Harris |first=Michael H. |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0810829725 |publication-place=Metuchen, N.J |title=History of libraries in the western world |publication-date=1995|date=January 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Private Subscription Libraries====
[[File:Linen Hall Library, 1888.jpg|thumb|The [[Linen Hall Library]] in Belfast was an 18th-century [[subscription library]]. Pictured in 1888, shortly before its demolition.]]
Private subscription libraries functioned in much the same manner as commercial subscription libraries, though they varied in many important ways. One of the most popular versions of the private subscription library was a gentleman's only library. Membership was restricted to the proprietors or shareholders, and ranged from a dozen or two to between four and five hundred.&lt;ref name="Kelly, Thomas 1966; p. 128"&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liverpool [[Subscription library|Subscription Library]] was a gentlemen only library. In 1798, it was renamed the Athenaeum when it was rebuilt with a newsroom and coffeehouse. It had an entrance fee of one guinea and annual subscription of five shillings.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of the registers for the first twelve years provides glimpses of middle-class reading habits in a mercantile community at this period. The largest and most popular sections of the library were History, Antiquities, and Geography, with 283 titles and 6,121 borrowings, and Belles Lettres, with 238 titles and 3,313 borrowings.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Paul. Libraries and Their Users. Page 29. The Library Association. 1969. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Donald McDonald, stationer, and his Circulating Library, Gulgong, 1870.jpg|left|thumb| [[Circulating library]] and stationery shop, [[Gulgong]], Australia 1870]]
Private subscription libraries held a greater amount of control over both membership and the types of books in the library. There was almost a complete elimination of cheap fiction in the private societies.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Paul (1969); p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Subscription libraries prided themselves on respectability. The highest percentage of subscribers were often landed proprietors, gentry, and old professions.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, David (2008); p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;  

Towards the end of the 18th century and in the first decades of the nineteenth, the need for books and general education made itself felt among social classes created by the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, Raymond (1964); p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; The late 18th century saw a rise in subscription libraries intended for the use of tradesmen. In 1797, there was established at Kendal what was known as the Economical Library, "designed principally for the use and instruction of the working classes".&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; There was also the Artizans' library established at Birmingham in 1799. The entrance fee was 3 shillings. The subscription was 1 shilling 6 pence per quarter. This was a library of general literature. Novels, at first excluded, were afterwards admitted on condition that they did not account for more than one-tenth of the annual income.&lt;ref name="Kelly, Thomas 1966; p. 128"/&gt;

Benjamin Franklin lead the founding of the first American subscription library. In Philadelphia, Franklin formed "a club of mutual improvements".. calling themselves the "Junto", which meant a council or a combination of individuals organized for a specific purpose. Because the men in this club had a steady income, they could afford to be apart of this club and afford to purchase books. Only some had enough to be considered a library; together they shared what they all had.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|last=Murray|first=Stuart|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2009|isbn=1602397066|location=|pages=145-147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National libraries===
{{main|National library}}
[[File:LindisfarneFol27rIncipitMatt.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|The [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] is but one of the treasures made available in the [[British Museum]] upon its establishment in 1753.]]
The first national libraries had their origins in the royal collections of the sovereign or some other supreme body of the state. This era is termed the "golden age of libraries", with millions of printed books available and widespread interest growing in both national and classical literature. National libraries would eventually become objects of pride in that same spirit, most Europeans considered themselves as belonging to a nation first and a religion second. Wars of religion would give way to wars of nationalism, as fierce and widespread as ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|last=Murray|first=Stuart|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2009|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would become a major turning point for many libraries and their collections. 

One of the first plans for a national library was devised by the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[mathematics|mathematician]] [[John Dee]], who in 1556 presented [[Mary I of England]] with a visionary plan for the preservation of old books, manuscripts and records and the founding of a national library, but his proposal was not taken up.&lt;ref&gt;Fell-Smith, Charlotte (1909) ''John Dee: 1527–1608''. London: Constable and Company [http://www.johndee.org/charlotte/ Available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first true national library was founded in 1753 as part of the [[British Museum]].
This new institution was the first of a new kind of museum – national, belonging to neither church nor the king, freely open to the public and aiming to collect everything.&lt;ref name="world and its people"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dunton |first=Larkin |title=The World and Its People |publisher=Silver, Burdett |year=1896 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum's foundations lay in the will of the physician and naturalist [[Hans Sloane|Sir Hans Sloane]], who gathered an enviable [[cabinet of curiosities|collection of curiosities]] over his lifetime which he bequeathed to the nation for £20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fathom.com/course/21701728/session1.html |title=Creating a Great Museum: Early Collectors and The British Museum |publisher=Fathom |accessdate=4 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102202555/http://fathom.com/course/21701728/session1.html |archivedate= 2 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloane's collection included some 40,000 printed books and 7,000 [[manuscript]]s, as well as [[Old master print|prints]] and drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/history/general_history.aspx|title=General history|website=British Museum|date=14 June 2010|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Museum Act 1753]] also incorporated the [[Cotton library]] and the [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Harleian library]]. These were joined in 1757 by the Royal Library, assembled by various [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarchs]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Charles Long (1823), BMCE115/3,10. Scrapbooks and illustrations of the Museum. (Wilson, David, M.) (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, pg 346&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the first national library was the [[Bibliothèque Mazarine]], which evolved from its origin as a royal library founded at the [[Louvre Palace]] by [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] in 1368. The appointment of [[Jacques Auguste de Thou]] as librarian in the 17th century, initiated a period of development that made it the largest and richest collection of books in the world.&lt;ref name=ea/&gt; The library opened to the public in 1692, under the administration of [[Camille le Tellier de Louvois|Abbé Louvois]], Minister Louvois's son. Abbé Louvois was succeeded by the [[Jérôme Bignon|Abbé Bignon]], or Bignon II as he was termed, who instituted a complete reform of the library's system. Catalogues were made, which appeared from 1739 to 1753 in 11 volumes. The collections increased steadily by purchase and gift to the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], at which time it was in grave danger of partial or total destruction, but owing to the activities of Antoine-Augustin Renouard and [[Joseph Van Praet]] it suffered no injury.&lt;ref name=ea/&gt;

The library's collections swelled to over 300,000 volumes during the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|radical phase]] of the [[French Revolution]], when the private libraries of aristocrats and clergy were seized. After the establishment of the [[French First Republic]] in September 1792, "the Assembly declared the ''Bibliotheque du Roi'' to be national property and the institution was renamed the ''[[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]]''. After four centuries of control by the Crown, this great library now became the property of the French people."&lt;ref name=priebe&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Paul M. |last1=Priebe|title=From Bibliothèque du Roi to Bibliothèque Nationale: The Creation of a State Library, 1789–1793|journal= The Journal of Library History (1974–1987)|volume= 17|issue= 4 |pages=389–408|date= 1982|jstor=25541320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern public library===
{{main|Public library}}
[[File:James Silk Buckingham by Clara S. Lane.jpg|thumb|[[James Silk Buckingham]] led the campaign for public libraries in the mid 19th century.]]
Although by the mid-19th century, England could claim 274 [[subscription library|subscription libraries]] and Scotland, 266, the foundation of the modern public library system in Britain is the [[Public Libraries Act 1850]]. The Act first gave local [[municipal borough|boroughs]] the power to establish free public libraries and was the first legislative step toward the creation of an enduring national institution that provides universal free access to information and literature. In the 1830s, at the height of the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement, there was a general tendency towards reformism in the United Kingdom. The [[Capitalism|Capitalist]] economic model had created a significant amount of free time for workers, and the middle classes were concerned that the workers' free time was not being well-spent. This was prompted more by Victorian middle class paternalism rather than by demand from the lower social orders.&lt;ref&gt;McMenemy (2009), pp. 24–26&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigners felt that encouraging the lower classes to spend their free time on morally uplifting activities, such as reading, would promote greater social good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Llibrary.htm |title=History of the Public Libraries Act |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316170538/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Llibrary.htm |archivedate=16 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1835, and against government opposition, [[James Silk Buckingham]], MP for Sheffield and a supporter of the [[temperance movement]], was able to secure the Chair of the [[Parliamentary select committees of the United Kingdom|Select Committee]] which would examine "the extent, causes, and consequences of the prevailing vice of intoxication among the labouring classes of the United Kingdom" and propose solutions. [[Francis Place]], a campaigner for the working class, agreed that, "The establishment of parish libraries and district reading rooms, and popular lectures on subjects both entertaining and instructive to the community might draw off a number of those who now frequent public houses for the sole enjoyment they afford".&lt;ref&gt;Select Committee on inquiry into drunkenness, ''Report'' (1834)&lt;/ref&gt; Buckingham introduced to Parliament a Public Institution Bill allowing boroughs to charge a tax to set up libraries and museums, the first of its kind. Although this did not become law, it had a major influence on [[William Ewart (British politician)|William Ewart]] MP and [[Joseph Brotherton]] MP, who introduced a bill which would "[empower] boroughs with a population of 10,000 or more to raise a ½d for the establishment of museums".&lt;ref&gt;Kelly &amp; Kelly (1977), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; This became the [[Museums Act 1845]].

The advocacy of Ewart and Brotherton then succeeded in having a select committee set up to consider public library provision. The Report argued that the provision of public libraries would steer people towards temperate and moderate habits. With a view to maximising the potential of current facilities, the Committee made two significant recommendations. They suggested that the government should issue grants to aid the foundation of libraries and that the Museums Act 1845 should be amended and extended to allow for a tax to be levied for the establishment of public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Minto (1932) chapters 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murison (1971) chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansard (1850) Col. 848&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill passed through [[Parliament]] as most MPs felt that public libraries would provide facilities for self-improvement through books and reading for all classes, and that the greater levels of education attained by providing public libraries would result in lower [[crime statistics|crime rates]].

The earliest example in England of a library to be endowed for the benefit of users who were not members of an institution such as a cathedral or college was the [[Francis Trigge Chained Library]] in [[Grantham]], [[Lincolnshire]], established in 1598. The library still exists and can justifiably claim to be the forerunner of later public library systems. The beginning of the modern, free, open access libraries really got its start in the UK in 1847. [[Parliament]] appointed a committee, led by William Ewart, on Public Libraries to consider the necessity of establishing libraries through the nation: In 1849, their report noted the poor condition of library service, it recommended the establishment of free public libraries all over the country, and it led to the Public Libraries Act in 1850, which allowed all cities with populations exceeding 10,000 to levy taxes for the support of public libraries.

Norwich was the eleventh library to open, in 1857, after [[Winchester]], [[Manchester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Bolton]], [[Kidderminster]], [[Cambridge]], [[Birkenhead]], and [[Sheffield]].

Another important act was the [[Elementary Education Act 1870|Education Act 1870]], which increased literacy and thereby the demand for libraries. By 1877, more than 75 cities had established free libraries, and by 1900 the number had reached 300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Michael H. |title=The History of Libraries in the Western World |year=1984 |location=London |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-1666-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finally marks the start of the public library as we know it. And these acts influenced similar laws in other countries, such as the US. The first tax-supported public library in the United States was [[Peterborough]], [[New Hampshire]] (1833) first supported by state funds then an "Act Providing for the Establishment of Public Libraries" in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shera |first=Jesse H. |title=Foundations of the Public Library: The Origins of the Public Library Movement in New England, 1629–1855 |year=1949 |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Expansion====
[[File:Andrew Carnegie at Skibo 1914 - Project Gutenberg eText 17976.jpg|thumb|[[Andrew Carnegie]] played an important role in financing public libraries across the [[English-speaking world]].]]
[[The American School Library]] (1839) was an early frontier traveling library in the [[United States]]. The year 1876 is key in the history of librarianship in the United States. The [[American Library Association]] was formed on October 6,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/aboutala/node/530/|title=ALA Website|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''The [[American Library Journal]]'', [[Melvil Dewey]] published his [[Dewey Decimal Classification|decimal-based system]] of classification, and the United States Bureau of Education published its report, "Public libraries in the United States of America; their history, condition, and management."  During the post-Civil War years, there was a rise in the establishment of public libraries, a movement led chiefly by newly formed [[Women's club (United States)|women's clubs]]. They contributed their own collections of books, conducted lengthy fund raising campaigns for buildings, and lobbied within their communities for financial support for libraries, as well as with legislatures and the [[Carnegie library]] Endowment founded in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Paula D. Watson, "Founding Mothers: The Contribution of Woman's Organizations to Public Library Development in the United States", ''Library Quarterly'', Vol. 64, Issue 3, 1994, p.236&lt;/ref&gt;  They led the establishment of 75–80 percent of the libraries in communities across the country.&lt;ref&gt;Teva Scheer, "The "Praxis" Side of the Equation: Club Women and American Public Administration", ''Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis'', Vol. 24, Issue 3, 2002, p.525&lt;/ref&gt;

Philanthropists and businessmen, including John Passmore Edwards, [[Henry Tate]] and [[Andrew Carnegie]], helped to increase the number of public libraries from the late 19th century. Carnegie alone built over 2000 libraries in the US, 660 [[Carnegie library|Carnegie Libraries]] in Britain, in addition to many more in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Theodore |title=Carnegie Libraries across America |publisher=Preservation Press |location=Washington |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-471-14422-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie also funded academic libraries, favoring small schools and schools with African American students.  "In 1899, Pennsylvania State College became the first college to receive Carnegie funding ($150,000) and their library was constructed in 1903."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ryan |first1=S |title='An Idea Likely Too Big': John B.

==Types==
Many institutions make a distinction between a circulating or [[lending library]], where materials are expected and intended to be loaned to patrons, institutions, or other libraries, and a reference library where material is not lent out. Travelling libraries, such as the early horseback libraries of eastern Kentucky&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Amazing Story of Kentucky's Horseback Librarians (10 Photos)|url=http://archiveproject.com/the-horseback-librarians-of-eastern-kentucky-10-photos|website=Archive Project|accessdate=19 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[bookmobiles]], are generally of the lending type. Modern libraries are often a mixture of both, containing a general collection for circulation, and a reference collection which is restricted to the library premises. Also, increasingly, digital collections enable broader access to material that may not circulate in print, and enables libraries to expand their collections even without building a larger facility.

===Academic libraries===
{{Main|Academic library}}

[[File:Cmglee London Maughan Library reading room.jpg|thumb|The round reading room of [[Maughan Library]], the main university library of [[King's College London]]]]
Academic libraries are generally located on college and university campuses and primarily serve the students and faculty of that and other academic institutions. Some academic libraries, especially those at public institutions, are accessible to members of the general public in whole or in part.

[[File:Egyetemi Könyvtár4.JPG|thumb|left|The University Library in [[Budapest]]]]
Academic libraries are libraries that are hosted in post-secondary educational institutions, such as colleges and universities. Their main function are to provide support in research and resource linkage for students and faculty of the educational institution. Specific course-related resources are usually provided by the library, such as copies of textbooks and article readings held on 'reserve' (meaning that they are loaned out only on a short-term basis, usually a matter of hours). Some academic libraries provide resources not usually associated with libraries, such as the ability to check out laptop computers, web cameras, or scientific calculators.

Academic libraries offer workshops and courses outside of formal, graded coursework, which are meant to provide students with the tools necessary to succeed in their programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://main.library.utoronto.ca/workshops/|title=St. George Library Workshops|website=utoronto.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; These workshops may include help with citations, effective search techniques, journal databases, and electronic citation software. These workshops provide students with skills that can help them achieve success in their academic careers (and often, in their future occupations), which they may not learn inside the classroom.

[[File:Robartslibrary.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Robarts Library]] at the [[University of Toronto]], Canada.]]
The academic library provides a quiet study space for students on campus; it may also provide group study space, such as meeting rooms. In North America, Europe, and other parts of the world, academic libraries are becoming increasingly digitally oriented. The library provides a "gateway" for students and researchers to access various resources, both print/physical and digital.&lt;ref&gt;Dowler, Lawrence (1997). ''Gateways to knowledge: the role of academic libraries in teaching, learning, and research''. {{ISBN|0-262-04159-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic institutions are subscribing to electronic journals databases, providing research and scholarly writing software, and usually provide computer workstations or computer labs for students to access journals, library search databases and portals, institutional electronic resources, Internet access, and course- or task-related software (i.e. word processing and spreadsheet software). Some academic libraries take on new roles, for instance, acting as an electronic repository for institutional scholarly research and academic knowledge, such as the collection and curation of digital copies of students' theses and dissertations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unllib.unl.edu/LPP/anunobi-okoye.htm |title=The Role of Academic Libraries in Universal Access to Print and Electronic Resources in the Developing Countries, Chinwe V. Anunobi, Ifeyinwa B.

===Children's libraries===
[[File:Children. Children's Library in N.D.G BAnQ Vieux-Montréal P48S1P08742.jpg|thumb|left|A children's library in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada in 1943]]
[[Children's libraries]] are special collections of books intended for juvenile readers and usually kept in separate rooms of general public libraries. Some children's libraries have entire floors or wings dedicated to them in bigger libraries while smaller ones may have a separate room or area for children. They are an educational agency seeking to acquaint the young with the world's literature and to cultivate a love for reading. Their work supplements that of the public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Americana|last=Modell |first=David A. |wstitle=Children's Libraries|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Services commonly provided by public libraries may include storytelling sessions for infants, toddlers, preschool children, or after-school programs, all with an intention of developing early literacy skills and a love of books. One of the most popular programs offered in public libraries are summer reading programs for children, families, and adults.&lt;ref&gt;Udomisor, I., Udomisor, E., &amp; Smith, E. (2013). Management of Communication Crisis in a Library and Its Influence on Productivity. In Information and Knowledge Management (Vol. 3, No. 8, pp. 13–21)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another popular reading program for children is PAWS TO READ or similar programs where children can read to certified therapy dogs. Since animals are a calming influence and there is no judgment, children learn confidence and a love of reading. Many states have these types of programs: parents need simply ask their librarian to see if it is available at their local library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paws to read|url=http://www.readingpaws.org/READingPaws/Welcome.html|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National libraries===
[[File:National Library of Wales.jpg|thumb|[[National Library of Wales]]]]
{{Main|National library}}
A [[national library|national or state library]] serves as a national repository of information, and has the right of [[legal deposit]], which is a legal requirement that publishers in the country need to deposit a copy of each publication with the library. Unlike a public library, a national library rarely allows citizens to borrow books. Often, their collections include numerous rare, valuable, or significant works. There are wider definitions of a national library, putting less emphasis on the [[Institutional repository|repository]] character.&lt;ref&gt;Line, Maurice B.; Line, J. (1979). "Concluding notes". ''National libraries'', Aslib, pp. 317–318&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lor, P. J.; Sonnekus, E. A. S. (1997). [http://www.ifla.org/VII/s1/gnl/index.htm "Guidelines for Legislation for National Library Services"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813200532/http://www.ifla.org/VII/s1/gnl/index.htm |date=13 August 2006 }}, [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions|IFLA]]. Retrieved on 10 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first national libraries had their origins in the royal collections of the sovereign or some other supreme body of the state.

Many national libraries cooperate within the National Libraries Section of the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA) to discuss their common tasks, define and promote common standards, and carry out projects helping them to fulfil their duties. The national libraries of Europe participate in [[European Library|The European Library]] which is a service of the Conference of European National Librarians (CENL).

===Public lending libraries===
{{Main|Public library}}
[[File:Biblioteka Raczyńskich.jpg|thumb|[[Raczyński Library]], the public library of [[Poznań]], Poland]]

A public library provides services to the general public. If the library is part of a [[county]]wide library system, citizens with an active library card from around that county can use the library branches associated with the library system. A library can serve only their city, however, if they are not a member of the county public library system. Much of the materials located within a public library are available for borrowing. The library staff decides upon the number of items patrons are allowed to borrow, as well as the details of borrowing time allotted.  Typically, libraries issue [[library card]]s to community members wishing to borrow books. Often visitors to a city are able to obtain a public library card.

Many public libraries also serve as community organizations that provide free services and events to the public, such as reading groups and toddler story time. For many communities, the library is a source of connection to a vast world, obtainable knowledge and understanding, and entertainment. According to a study by the [[Pennsylvania Library Association]], public library services play a major role in fighting rising illiteracy rates among youths.&lt;ref&gt;Celano, D., &amp; Neumann, S. B. (2001). The role of public libraries in children's literacy development: An evaluation report. Pennsylvania, PA: Pennsylvania Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Public libraries are protected and funded by the public they serve.
[[File:Bates Hall - Boston Public Library.jpg|thumb|Bates Hall, the main reading room of the [[Boston Public Library]]]]

As the number of books in libraries have steadily increased since their inception, the need for compact storage and access with adequate lighting has grown. The ''[[library stack|stack system]]'' involves keeping a library's collection of books in a space separate from the reading room. This arrangement arose in the 19th century. Book stacks quickly evolved into a fairly standard form in which the [[cast iron]] and [[steel]] frameworks supporting the bookshelves also supported the floors, which often were built of translucent blocks to permit the passage of light (but were not transparent, for reasons of modesty). The introduction of [[electric light|electrical lighting]] had a huge impact on how the library [[lighting in libraries|operated]]. The use of glass floors was largely discontinued, though floors were still often composed of metal grating to allow air to circulate in multi-story stacks. As more space was needed, a method of moving shelves on tracks (compact shelving) was introduced to cut down on otherwise wasted aisle space.

[[File:ET Amhara asv2018-02 img120 Awra Amba.jpg|thumb|left|A community library in [[Ethiopia]].]]
[[Library 2.0]], a term coined in 2005, is the library's response to the challenge of Google and an attempt to meet the changing needs of users by using [[web 2.0]] technology. Some of the aspects of Library 2.0 include, commenting, tagging, bookmarking, discussions, use of online social networks by libraries, [[plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]], and [[Software widget|widgets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cohen |first=L.B. |title=A Manifesto for our time |year=2007 |pages=47–9 |journal=American Libraries |volume=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by web 2.0, it is an attempt to make the library a more user-driven institution.

Despite the importance of public libraries, they are routinely having their budgets cut by state legislature. Funding has dwindled so badly that many public libraries have been forced to cut their hours and release employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jaeger |first=Paul T. |last2=Bertot |first2=John Carol |last3=Gorham |first3=Ursula |title=Wake Up the Nation: Public Libraries, Policy Making, and Political Discourse |journal=The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy |date=January 2013 |volume=83 |issue=1 |pages=61–72 |doi=10.1086/668582 |jstor=10.1086/668582 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reference libraries{{anchor|Reference library}}===
A reference library does not lend books and other items; instead, they must be read at the library itself. Typically, such libraries are used for research purposes, for example at a university. Some items at reference libraries may be historical and even unique. Many lending libraries contain a "reference section", which holds books, such as dictionaries, which are common reference books, and are therefore not lent out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George |last=Ehrenhaft |first2=William |last2=Howard Armstrong |first3=M.

===Research libraries{{anchor|Research library}}===
{{main|Research library}}

A research library is a collection of materials on one or more subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Young |first=Heartsill |title=ALA Glossary of Library and Information Science |year=1983 |page=188 |publisher=American Library Association |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-0-8389-0371-1 |oclc=8907224}}&lt;/ref&gt; A research library supports scholarly or scientific research and will generally include [[primary source|primary]] as well as [[secondary source]]s; it will maintain permanent collections and attempt to provide access to all necessary materials. A research library is most often an [[academic library|academic]] or [[national library]], but a large [[special library]] may have a research library within its special field, and a very few of the largest public libraries also serve as research libraries. A large university library may be considered a research library; and in North America, such libraries may belong to the [[Association of Research Libraries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arl.org/arl/membership/members.shtml |title=Association of Research Libraries (ARL) :: Member Libraries |website=arl.org |year=2012 |accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, they may be members of [[Research Libraries UK|Research Libraries UK (RLUK)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rluk.ac.uk/|title=RLUK: Research Libraries UK|publisher=RLUK|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A research library can be either a reference library, which does not lend its holdings, or a lending library, which does lend all or some of its holdings. Some extremely large or traditional research libraries are entirely reference in this sense, lending none of their materials; most academic research libraries, at least in the US and the UK, now lend books, but not periodicals or other materials. Many research libraries are attached to a parental organization and serve only members of that organization.  Examples of research libraries include the [[British Library]], the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] and the [[New York Public Library Main Branch]] on 42nd Street in Manhattan, [[State Public Scientific &amp; Technological Library|State Public Scientific Technological Library of the Sibirian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spsl.nsc.ru/en/|title=SPSTL SB RAS|website=www.spsl.nsc.ru|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypl.org/help/about-nypl|title=Our Story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital libraries===
{{main article|Digital library}}

Digital libraries are libraries that house digital resources. They are defined as an organization and not a service that provide access to digital works, have a preservation responsibility to provide future access to materials, and provides these items easily and affordably.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury &amp; Foo"&gt;{{cite book|title=Digital Libraries and Information Access: research perspectives|last1=Chowdhury|first1=G. G.|last2=Foo|first2=C.|date=2012|publisher=Neal-Schuman|year=|isbn=9781555709143|oclc=869282690|location=Chicago|pages=2–3|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of a digital library implies that "a digital library uses a variety of software, networking technologies and standards to facilitate access to digital content and data to a designated user community."{{sfnp|Chowdhury|Foo|2012|pp=3–4}} Access to digital libraries can be influenced by several factors, either individually or together. The most common factors that influence access are: The library's content, the characteristics and information needs of the target users, the library's digital interface, the goals and objectives of the library's organizational structure, and the standards and regulations that govern library use.{{sfnp|Chowdhury|Foo|2012|p=49}} Access will depend on the users ability to discover and retrieve documents that interest them and that they require, which in turn is a preservation question. Digital objects cannot be preserved passively, they must be curated by digital librarians to ensure the trust and integrity of the digital objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Scholarship in the digital age: information, infrastructure, and the Internet|last=Borgman|first=Christine L.|year=2007|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262026192|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=88|oclc=181028448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest considerations for digital librarians is the need to provide long-term access to their resources; to do this, there are two issues requiring watchfulness: Media failure and format obsolescence. With media failure, a particular digital item is unusable because of some sort of error or problem. A scratched CD-Rom, for example, will not display its contents correctly, but another, unscratched disk will not have that problem. Format obsolescence is when a digital format has been superseded by newer technology, and so items in the old format are unreadable and unusable. Dealing with media failure is a reactive process, because something is done only when a problem presents itself. In contrast, format obsolescence is preparatory, because changes are anticipated and solutions are sought before there is a problem.{{sfnp|Chowdhury|Foo|2012|p=211}}

Future trends in digital preservation include: Transparent enterprise models for digital preservation, launch of self-preserving objects, increased flexibility in digital preservation architectures, clearly-defined metrics for comparing preservation tools, and terminology and standards interoperability in real time.{{sfnp|Chowdhury|Foo|2012|p=211}}

===Special libraries===
{{Main|Special library}}All other libraries fall into the "[[special library]]" category. Many private businesses and public organizations, including hospitals, churches, museums, research laboratories, law firms, and many government departments and agencies, maintain their own libraries for the use of their employees in doing specialized research related to their work. Depending on the particular institution, special libraries may or may not be accessible to the general public or elements thereof. In more specialized institutions such as law firms and research laboratories, librarians employed in special libraries are commonly specialists in the institution's field rather than generally trained librarians, and often are not required to have advanced degrees in specifically library-related field due to the specialized content and clientele of the library.

Special libraries can also include women's libraries or LGBTQ libraries, which serve the needs of women and the LGBTQ community. [[Libraries and the LGBTQ community]] have an extensive history, and there are currently many libraries, archives, and special collections devoted to preserving and helping the LGBTQ community. Women's libraries, such as the Vancouver Women's Library or the [[Women's Library]] @LSE are examples of women's libraries that offer services to women and girls and focus on women's history.

Some special libraries, such as governmental law libraries, hospital libraries, and military base libraries commonly are open to public visitors to the institution in question. Depending on the particular library and the clientele it serves, special libraries may offer services similar to research, reference, public, academic, or children's libraries, often with restrictions such as only lending books to patients at a hospital or restricting the public from parts of a military collection. Given the highly individual nature of special libraries, visitors to a special library are often advised to check what services and restrictions apply at that particular library.

Special libraries are distinguished from [[special collections]], which are branches or parts of a library intended for rare books, manuscripts, and other special materials, though some special libraries have special collections of their own, typically related to the library's specialized subject area.

For more information on specific types of special libraries, see [[law library|law libraries]], [[medical library|medical libraries]], [[music library|music libraries]], or [[transportation libraries]].

==Organization==
[[File:HK Wan Chai Library Inside Bookcase a.jpg|thumb|Library shelves in Hong Kong, showing numbers of the classification scheme to help readers locate works in that section]]

Most libraries have materials arranged in a specified order according to a [[library classification]] system, so that items may be located quickly and collections may be browsed efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Library classification|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/library-classification|website=britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some libraries have additional galleries beyond the public ones, where reference materials are stored. These reference stacks may be open to selected members of the public. Others require patrons to submit a "stack request", which is a request for an assistant to retrieve the material from the closed stacks: see [[List of closed stack libraries]] (in progress).

Larger libraries are often divided into departments staffed by both paraprofessionals and professional [[librarian]]s.

* Reference – Staffs a [[reference desk]] answering questions from users (using structured [[reference interview]]s), instructing users, and developing library programming. Reference may be further broken down by user groups or materials; common collections are [[children's literature]], [[Young adult fiction|young adult literature]], and [[genealogy]] materials.
* Technical Services – Works behind the scenes cataloging and processing new materials and deaccessioning [[Weeding (library)|weeded materials]].
* Stacks Maintenance – Re-shelves materials that have been returned to the library after patron use and shelves materials that have been processed by Technical Services. Stacks Maintenance also shelf reads the material in the stacks to ensure that it is in the correct library classification order.

Basic tasks in [[library management]] include the planning of acquisitions (which materials the library should acquire, by purchase or otherwise), library classification of acquired materials, preservation of materials (especially rare and fragile archival materials such as manuscripts), the deaccessioning of materials, patron borrowing of materials, and developing and administering library computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Library and information center management|last1=Stueart |first1=Robert |last2=Moran |first2=Barbara B. |last3=Morner |first3=Claudia J.|isbn=9781598849882|edition=Eighth|location=Santa Barbara, California|oclc=780481202 |year=2013 |publisher= Libraries Unlimited}}&lt;/ref&gt; More long-term issues include the planning of the construction of new libraries or extensions to existing ones, and the development and implementation of outreach services and reading-enhancement services (such as adult literacy and children's programming).

Librarians have sometimes complained&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bennett|first=Scott|date=Apr 2009|title=Libraries and Learning: A History of Paradigm Change|url=|journal=Portal : Libraries and the Academy|volume=9|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; that some of the library buildings which have been used to accommodate libraries have been inadequate for the demands made upon them. In general, this condition may have resulted from one or more of the following causes:
# an effort to erect a [[monument]]al building{{Vague|date=May 2012}}; most of those who commission library buildings are not librarians and their priorities may be different
# to conform it to a type of [[architecture]] unsuited to library purposes
# the appointment, often by competition, of an architect unschooled in the requirements of a library
# failure to consult with the librarian or with library experts

Much advancement has undoubtedly been made toward cooperation between architect and librarian,{{when|date=September 2012}} and many good designers have made library buildings their speciality, nevertheless it seems that the ideal type of library is not yet realized—the type so adapted to its purpose that it would be immediately recognized as such, as is the case with school buildings at the present time.{{when|date=September 2012}} This does not mean that library constructions should conform rigidly to a fixed standard of appearance and arrangement, but it does mean that the exterior should express as nearly as possible the purpose and functions of the interior.&lt;ref name=ea&gt;{{Americana|last=Wiley |first=Edwin |wstitle=Library Architecture and Construction|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrons may not know how to fully use the library's resources. This can be due to some individuals' unease in approaching a staff member. Ways in which a library's content is displayed or accessed may have the most impact on use. An antiquated or clumsy search system, or staff unwilling or untrained to engage their patrons, will limit a library's usefulness. In the [[public library|public libraries]] of the United States, beginning in the 19th century, these problems drove the emergence of the [[library instruction]] movement, which advocated library user education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiss|first=S. C.|date=2003|title=The origin of library instruction in the United States, 1820–1900|journal=Research Strategies|volume=19|issue=3/4|pages=233–243|doi=10.1016/j.resstr.2004.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the early leaders was [[John Cotton Dana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mattson|first=K.|date=2000|title=The librarian as secular minister to democracy: The life and ideas of John Cotton Dana|journal=Libraries &amp; Culture|volume=35|issue=4|pages=514–534|jstor=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic form of library instruction is sometimes known as [[information literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=T. E.|date=2006|title=Information literacy: Adapting to the media age|journal=Alki|volume=22|issue=1|pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libraries should inform their users of what materials are available in their collections and how to access that information. Before the computer age, this was accomplished by the card [[library catalog|catalogue]]—a cabinet (or multiple cabinets) containing many drawers filled with [[index card]]s that identified books and other materials. In a large library, the card catalogue often filled a large room. The emergence of the [[Internet]], however, has led to the adoption of electronic catalogue databases (often referred to as "webcats" or as [[online public access catalog]]ues, OPACs), which allow users to search the library's holdings from any location with Internet access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sloan|first=B|last2=White|first2=M. S. B.|date=1992|title=Online public access catalogs|journal=Academic and Library Computing|volume=9|issue=2|pages=9–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of catalogue maintenance is compatible with new types of libraries, such as [[digital library|digital libraries]] and [[distributed library|distributed libraries]], as well as older libraries that have been [[retrofitting|retrofitted]]. Electronic catalogue databases are criticized by some who believe that the old card catalogue system was both easier to navigate and allowed retention of information, by writing directly on the cards, that is lost in the electronic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mamis |first=Joshua |url=http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/life_death_of_the_card_catalog/ |newspaper=New Haven Independent |title=Dewey Decimal didn't die |date=25 November 2011 |accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument is analogous to the debate over paper books and [[e-book]]s. While libraries have been accused of precipitously throwing out valuable information in card catalogues, most modern ones have nonetheless made the move to electronic catalogue databases. Large libraries may be scattered within multiple buildings across a town, each having multiple floors, with multiple rooms housing the resources across a series of shelves. Once a user has located a resource within the catalogue, they must then use navigational guidance to retrieve the resource physically; a process that may be assisted through signage, maps, GPS systems, or RFID tagging.

[[Finland]] has the highest number of registered book borrowers per capita in the world. Over half of Finland's population are registered borrowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pantzar |first=Katja |url=http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=160064&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US |title=The humble Number One: Finland |publisher=This is Finland |date=September 2010 |accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, public library users have borrowed on average roughly 15 books per user per year from 1856 to 1978. From 1978 to 2004, book circulation per user declined approximately 50%. The growth of audiovisuals circulation, estimated at 25% of total circulation in 2004, accounts for about half of this decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://galbithink.org/libraries/circulation.htm Statistics on Book Circulation Per User of U.S. Public Libraries Since 1856&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] from galbithink.org&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bibliotheca Alexandrina interior - 2008-07-17.JPG|thumb|Interior of the [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]], Alexandria, Egypt, showing both stacks and computer terminals]]

In the 21st century, there has been increasing use of the Internet to gather and retrieve data. The shift to digital libraries has greatly impacted the way people use physical libraries. Between 2002 and 2004, the average American academic library saw the overall number of transactions decline approximately 2.2%.&lt;ref&gt;Applegate, Rachel. "Whose Decline? Which Academic Libraries are "Deserted" in Terms of Reference Transactions?" ''Reference &amp; User Services Quarterly''; 2nd ser. 48 (2008): 176–89. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Libraries are trying to keep up with the digital world and the new generation of students that are used to having information just one click away. For example, the University of California Library System saw a 54% decline in circulation between 1991 and 2001 of 8,377,000 books to 3,832,000.&lt;ref&gt;University of California Library Statistics 1990–91, University-wide Library Planning, University of California Office of the President (July 1991): 12; University of California Library Statistics July 2001, 7, [http://www.slp.ucop.edu/stats/00-01.pdf Ucop.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702182256/http://www.slp.ucop.edu/stats/00-01.pdf |date= 2 July 2010 }}.

These facts might be a consequence of the increased availability of e-resources. In 1999–2000, 105 ARL university libraries spent almost $100&amp;nbsp;million on electronic resources, which is an increase of nearly $23&amp;nbsp;million from the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arl.org/newsltr/219/eresources.html "ARL Libraries Spend Nearly $100 Million on Electronic Resources," ''ARL Bimonthly Report 219'', Association of Research Libraries (December 2001)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521154449/http://www.arl.org/newsltr/219/eresources.html |date=21 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 report by the Open E-book Forum found that close to a million e-books had been sold in 2002, generating nearly $8&amp;nbsp;million in revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Striphas, Ted. ''The Late Age of Print: Everyday Book Culture From Consumerism to Control''. New York City: [[Columbia University Press]], 2009.

One claim to why there is a decrease in the usage of libraries stems from the observation of the research habits of undergraduate students enrolled in colleges and universities. There have been claims that college undergraduates have become more used to retrieving information from the Internet than a traditional library. As each generation becomes more in tune with the Internet, their desire to retrieve information as quickly and easily as possible has increased. Finding information by simply searching the Internet could be much easier and faster than reading an entire book. In a survey conducted by NetLibrary, 93% of undergraduate students claimed that finding information online makes more sense to them than going to the library. Also, 75% of students surveyed claimed that they did not have enough time to go to the library and that they liked the convenience of the Internet. While the retrieving information from the Internet may be efficient and time saving than visiting a traditional library, research has shown that undergraduates are most likely searching only .03% of the entire web.&lt;ref&gt;Troll, Denise A. "How and Why are Libraries Changing?" Digital Library Federation. Library Information Technology – Carnegie Mellon, 9 January 2001. Web. 29 November 2009. [http://www.diglib.org/use/whitepaper.htm Diglib.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The information that they are finding might be easy to retrieve and more readily available, but may not be as in depth as information from other resources such as the books available at a physical library.

In the mid-2000s, Swedish company Distec invented a library book vending machine known as the [[GoLibrary]], that offers library books to people where there is no branch, limited hours, or high traffic locations such as [[El Cerrito del Norte station|El Cerrito del Norte]] [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART station]] in [[California]].

[[Public library advocacy]] is support given to a [[public library]] for its financial and philosophical goals or needs. Most often this takes the form of monetary or material donations or campaigning to the institutions which oversee the library, sometimes by advocacy groups such as [[Friends of Libraries]] and community members. Originally, library advocacy was centered on the library itself, but current trends show libraries positioning themselves to demonstrate they provide "economic value to the community" in means that are not directly related to the checking out of books and other media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Ellen G.  |date=2009|title=Hard Times = A New Brand of Advocacy|journal=Georgia Library Quarterly|volume= 46|issue=1|url=http://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1269&amp;context=glq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9323">This is a '''list of building materials'''.  Many types of [[building material]]s are used in the [[construction]] industry to create [[:Category:Buildings and structures|buildings and structures]].

These categories of materials and products are used by [[architect]]s and construction [[project manager]]s to specify the materials and methods used for [[Construction|building projects]].

Some building materials like cold rolled steel framing are considered modern methods of construction, over the traditionally slower methods like blockwork and timber.  Many building materials have a variety of uses, therefore it is always a good idea to consult the manufacturer to check if a product is best suited to your requirements.

==Catalogs==
Catalogs distributed by architectural product suppliers are typically organized into these groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4757">'''Lumia''' is a form of [[art]] that uses [[light]]; originally associated with music but was later associated with painting. The term was coined by a 20th-century artist, [[Thomas Wilfred]].&lt;ref name="CFM Collopy Choose this"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collopy|first1=Fred|title=Color, Form, and Motion: Dimensions of a Musical Art of Light|journal=Leonardo|volume=2000|issue=355|pages=355–356|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century artists began to promote colors and light together in their artworks.&lt;ref name="Esk Framework"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eskilan|first1=Stephen|title=Thomas Wilfred and Intermedia: Seeking a Framework for Lumia|journal=Leonardo|volume=2003|issue=65|pages=65–68|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilfred worked towards establishing lumia as a new form of art but the term never caught on. Despite creating the term lumia, Wilfred did not create the use of light in art.

== Thomas Wilfred ==
Thomas Wilfred, (1889–1968), was the first artist in the United States to use light as the sole means of expression for his artwork. He consistently used colored light in his works. Wilfred was born in [[Denmark]] in 1889 and emigrated to the U.S. in 1916. Wilfred explored light and color in art as early as 1905. In 1921, Wilfred created his first portable [[clavilux]], a machine that allowed for the creation and performance of lumia. Clavilux is a term in Latin that means "light played by key". In 1930 Wilfred founded a center for research in lumia, the Art Institute of Light. The institute closed down during World War ll. In the early 1930s he transitioned from the musical aspect of lumia to painting.&lt;ref name=MOMA /&gt; Wilfred planned to turn lumia into a formal art form, an "eighth art"; Wilfred wanted lumia to be its own art form of expression.

== Lumia ==
The three main elements of lumia, defined by Wilfred, are form, color, and motion in a dark space. The most important are said to be form and motion. Wilfred's original contribution to lumia was the introduction of a fourth dimension - time. Since 1924, lumia accompanied music, dance, and drama.&lt;ref name=MOMA&gt;{{cite web|last1=Museum of Modern Art|title=Thomas Wilfred: Lumia|url=https://www.moma.org/momaorg/shared/pdfs/docs/press_archives/4690/releases/MOMA_1971_0127_89A.pdf?2010|website=https://www.moma.org|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Musical aspects ===
In a musical sense, Lumia is used to accompany music by adding a visual effect. Wilfred mentioned that Lumia has three factors, "Form, color, and motion are the three basic factors in lumia - as in all visual experience - and form and motion are the two most important."&lt;ref name="CFM Collopy Choose this" /&gt;

==== Clavilux ====
A term also coined by Thomas Wilfred to refer to his invention that allowed the creation and performance of Lumia. [[Clavilux]] means "light played by key" in Latin. The term used by other artists was known as color organ. 
	
==== Light Organ ====
Louis-Bertrand Castel invented the first light organ in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="Synth Collopy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collopy|first1=Fred|title=Improvisational Lumia: Painting along with Musicians|journal=Leonardo|volume=2001|issue=353|page=353|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For more information check [[light organ]] or [[color organ]].

=== Painting aspects ===
There are different forms of art that use light as a medium:
	
==== Light art ====
[[Light art]] is an art form that focuses on the expression of light. Light art includes stained glass which transmits light through colored glass. This type of art dates back to the 4th century. This art is found in churches and mosques with stained glass windows. Another used of light art is shadow puppetry in which shadows can create moving images. This art can be dated back to 380 BC by the use of Plato in the Allegory of the cave. Light art is even used in modern photography and motion pictures which uses artificial light to help captures images. Artists recognized for their use of light include [[James Turrell]], [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]], [[Dan Flavin]],  [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Leo Villareal]], and [[Mel and Dorothy Tanner]].
	
==== Light painting ====
[[Light painting]] is a term used for a photographic technique. It is done by moving a light source or the camera while taking a long exposure photograph to produce a light painting. This creates a photograph that looks like it was painted with light. Painting with a light source dates back to 1889.

[[File:Civic Opera House 060528.jpg|thumb|Exterior of the Civic Opera House]]
'''Lyric Opera of Chicago''' is one of the leading [[opera]] companies in the United States. It was founded in [[Chicago]] in 1954, under the name 'Lyric Theatre of Chicago' by [[Carol Fox (Chicago opera)|Carol Fox]], [[Nicolà Rescigno]] and Lawrence Kelly, with a season that included [[Maria Callas]]'s American debut in ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]''. The company was re-organized by Fox in 1956 under its present name and, after her 1981 departure, it has continued to be of one of the major opera companies in the United States.  The Lyric is housed in the [[Civic Opera Building]], which the company now owns.

==Opera in Chicago 1850–1954==
The first opera to be performed in Chicago was Bellini's ''[[La sonnambula]]'', presented by a traveling opera company on 29 July 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Preston 1993, p. ??: "One measure of ''La sonnambula'' 's popularity is the fact that it was the first opera to be performed in Chicago."&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago's first opera house opened in 1865 but was destroyed in the [[Great Fire of Chicago]] in 1871. The second opera house, the [[Chicago Auditorium]], opened in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;"Chicago Opera" in ''The Encyclopedia Americana'' (1973), Volume 1: "Chicago's first opera house opened in 1865 but was destroyed in the Great Fire five years later. A new house, the Auditorium, opened in 1889"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 the current [[Civic Opera House]] on 20 North Wacker Drive was opened, though the [[Chicago Civic Opera]] Company itself collapsed in the [[Great Depression]]. The old Auditorium continued to produce stage shows and musicals till it closed in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitz, p. 93: "In 1929 it relinquished its role as Chicago's premier opera house to the new Civic Opera Building (see p. 95). But six years earlier,... ''Hellzapoppin'' was the last show to grace the stage before the Auditorium closed in 1941."&lt;/ref&gt;

Resident opera companies began in Chicago in 1910 with the [[Chicago Grand Opera Company]] being formed from the remains of the Manhattan Opera Company, which had been founded by Oscar Hammerstein I, and had been squeezed out by the more financially sound Metropolitan Opera. Chicago had this first company for four seasons, then, after no season in 1914/15, it was re-formed as the [[Chicago Opera Association]]. This lasted through 1921/22, when it became the [[Chicago Civic Opera]] from 1922 until 1932. After no season in 1932/33, the company was re-formed and again named the Chicago Grand Opera Company from 1933 to 1935. From 1936 to 1939, the company was called [[Chicago City Opera Company]], and finally from 1940 to 1946 opera was presented by the [[Chicago Opera Company]]. There were no seasons from 1947 until 1953, so opera was presented by other companies on tour. Lyric Opera was formed in 1954 and has continued uninterrupted except for 1967.

==Lyric Opera, 1954 to 1980==
Carol Fox, America's first female opera impresario at the age of 28, began her first season in 1954 by bringing [[Maria Callas]] for her American debut in the title role of ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'', the first of many electrifying Callas performances in Chicago. However, this first eight-opera season in 1954 was not the result of a long apprenticeship in opera production; Carol Fox, fluent in Italian and French, had studied opera singing for many years, culminating in two years of intensive work in Italy. However, when she realized that performance was not to be in her future, she decided that it lay in bringing the performances of the world's finest artists to her home town of Chicago. Her success can be measured in one statistic regarding the filling of the Lyric's Civic Opera House: in 1954, the season ran for three weeks; in 2007/08 the Lyric had an almost six-month season.

Fox also used her formidable persuasive powers on artists other than singers: she was able to bring [[Rudolph Nureyev]] to make his debut on an American opera stage at the Lyric; [[Vera Zorina]], [[Alicia Markova]], [[Erik Bruhn]] and [[Maria Tallchief]] also danced at the Lyric, and [[George Balanchine]] created choreography for the Lyric. The Italian composer [[Pino Donati]] was her artistic director. [[Bruno Bartoletti]] was principal conductor, but other conductors included [[Tullio Serafin]], [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]] and [[Artur Rodzinski]]. [[Christoph von Dohnányi]] and Sir [[Georg Solti]] chose the Lyric for their American operatic debuts. [[Franco Zeffirelli]] staged operas as did [[Harold Prince]].

Because of her illnesses and her refusal to lower her artistic standards despite the Lyric's dire financial state in 1980, her resignation was sought and given. Carol Fox died a few months later, survived by a daughter Victoria.

It was of the Lyric's founder that [[Saul Bellow]] wrote in 1979 "Miss Fox will be remembered, together with Jane Addams of Hull House and Harriet Monroe of Poetry magazine, as one of Chicago's greatest women."&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, Claudia, foreword by Saul Bellow, ''Lyric Opera of Chicago'', The Opera,1979, {{ISBN|0960353801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the many years at the Lyric, Carol Fox developed the confidence and authority to bring world-famous artists to the Lyric: [[Luciano Pavarotti]] (56 performances in 7 roles), [[Tito Gobbi]], [[Eleanor Steber]], [[Jussi Björling]], [[Birgit Nilsson]], [[Renata Tebaldi]], [[Giuseppe Di Stefano]], [[Giulietta Simionato]], [[Richard Tucker]], [[Boris Christoff]], [[Eileen Farrell]], [[Dorothy Kirsten]], [[Leonie Rysanek]], [[Leontyne Price]], [[Elisabeth Schwarzkopf]], [[Geraint Evans]], [[Mirella Freni]], [[Nicolai Ghiaurov]], [[Alfredo Kraus]], [[Renata Scotto]], [[Robert Merrill]], [[Joan Sutherland]], [[Christa Ludwig]], [[Jon Vickers]], [[Marilyn Horne]], [[Grace Bumbry]], [[Montserrat Caballé]], [[Tatiana Troyanos]], [[Sherrill Milnes]], [[Plácido Domingo]], [[Felicia Weathers]] and [[José Carreras]]. [[Anna Moffo]] also chose the Lyric for her American debut.

==Later administrations, 1981 to the present==
Carol Fox was succeeded at the Lyric by her longtime assistant manager, [[Ardis Krainik]] (1981–1996), after whom the opera house was named, and then by William Mason (1997–2011). [[Anthony Freud]] took over in October 2011.

Sir [[Andrew Davis (conductor)|Andrew Davis]] is Lyric's music director and principal conductor, a post he has occupied since in September 2000. He led three complete cycles of ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' in the 2004/05 season to mark the company's 50th anniversary. [[Danny Newman]] was the company's long-time press agent from 1954 until his retirement in the 2001/02 season; Newman is largely credited as the founder of subscription-based arts marketing, the standard economic model for not-for-profit arts organizations in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Weber, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904EFDD153BF930A1575AC0A961958260 "Arts in America; The Unsung Hero of Nonprofit Theater Is Still Selling"], ''The New York Times'', 23 December 1997&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip David Morehead]] was head of music staff until his retirement in 2015.

==Production history==
In addition to the [[List of famous operas|standard operatic repertoire]], Lyric also presents contemporary works. Recent productions have included [[John Harbison|Harbison's]] ''[[The Great Gatsby#Opera|The Great Gatsby]]'' (2000–2001), [[Kurt Weill|Weill's]] ''[[Street Scene (opera)|Street Scene]]'' (2001–2002), [[Carlisle Floyd|Floyd's]] ''[[Susannah]]'', [[Stephen Sondheim|Sondheim's]] ''[[Sweeney Todd (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]'' (2002–2003), and [[John Adams]]' ''[[Doctor Atomic]]'' directed by Peter Sellars.

Composer [[William Bolcom]] wrote his most recent opera for Lyric, ''[[A Wedding (opera)|A Wedding]]'', based on the 1978 film of the same name directed by [[Robert Altman]]. It premiered during Lyric's 50th-anniversary season. During the 2015/16 season, the company premiered its latest commission, ''[[Bel Canto (opera)|Bel Canto]]'' by Peruvian composer [[Jimmy López]] with a libretto by [[Nilo Cruz]] based on the novel by [[Ann Patchett]].

The Lyric Opera productions were broadcast and nationally syndicated by [[WFMT]] Radio Network, from 1971 until 2001. 
The broadcasts ceased then because of a loss of sponsorship &lt;ref&gt;Sponsors' Withdrawal Ends Lyric Opera Radio Show: John von Rhein, Chicago Tribune, September 13, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;.  The issue was resolved at the 11th hour for the October 21, 2006 premiere of [[Richard Strauss]]'s opera ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' starring [[Deborah Voigt]]. Syndicated broadcast of the Lyric Opera resumed in May 2007 on the [[WFMT]] network, which was included on [[XM Satellite Radio]] before it merged and became SiriusXM Radio.

:''For details, see [[Civic Opera House (Chicago)|Civic Opera House]]''

The company's permanent home is the [[Civic Opera House (Chicago)|Civic Opera House]], a building which it rented from 1954 until after the 1993 renovations. It is a 1929 structure with an [[Art Deco]] interior. Its 3,563-seat capacity makes it the second-largest opera auditorium in [[North America]] after the [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera House]] in New York City. The interior was named ''The Ardis Krainik Theatre'' in 1996 in honor of Ardis Krainik, the former General Director, who was responsible for its renovation from 1993 onwards.

===Joffrey Ballet===

In 2017, Lyric Opera of Chicago as house manager of the theater announced that the [[Joffrey Ballet]] plans to move from its longtime performance venue at the [[Auditorium Theatre]] to the opera house in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/ct-ae-lyric-joffrey-jones-1001-story.html |title=How the Lyric and Joffrey's new partnership will change cultural Chicago |last=Jones |first=Chris |work=chicagotribune.com |access-date=2017-12-22 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement coincided with the Lyric’s presentation of a new production of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck's]] ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'' by choreographer [[John Neumeier]]; the production fused the musical and ballet elements of the opera and featured the Joffrey Ballet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/reviews/ct-ent-lyric-joffrey-orphee-review-20170924-story.html|title=Review: Triumphant new 'Orphee' presages strong partnership of Lyric Opera, Joffrey Ballet|last=von Rhein|first=John|date=September 24, 2017|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center==
The Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center (formerly Lyric Opera Center for American Artists, 1981–2006), established in 1974 by Carol Fox, is the professional artist-development program for Lyric Opera of Chicago.

Approximately a dozen young singers are selected from the near 400 who audition annually,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyricopera.org/about/ryanopera.aspx The Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016025244/http://www.lyricopera.org/about/ryanopera.aspx |date=2009-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and they are in residence for twelve months. Over the course of the year they receive advanced instruction in numerous aspects of operatic performance, including voice lessons and coachings, language and acting training, and master classes with some of opera’s most renowned artists. The singers gain valuable performing experience by participating in recitals and concerts at many Chicago-area venues. During Lyric Opera’s mainstage season, they perform and understudy roles at all levels. The singers work with the world’s greatest opera singers, conductors, and directors, thus advancing the young artists’ professionalism. In 2005, author [[William Murray (writer)|William Murray]] wrote a book about a year in the life of an entering class at the Ryan Opera Center.&lt;ref&gt;See Murray, William 2006, ''Fortissimo: Backstage at the Opera with Sacred Monsters and Young Singers''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Foldi]] was Director of the Ryan Opera Center from 1991 to 1995. He was succeeded by [[Richard Pearlman]], who was Director of the program from 1995 until his death in 2006. Renowned soprano [[Gianna Rolandi]], who had been the Ryan Opera Center's Director of Vocal Studies and principal instructor since 2002, was appointed Director of the program in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2006/5/News/Gianna_Rolandi_Named_as_New_Lyric_Opera_Center_for_American_Artists_Director.html "Gianna Rolandi Named as New Lyric Opera Center for American Artists Director"], ''[[Opera News]]''. May 9, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The program is now administered by Dan Novak, Director; Craig Terry, Music Director; Julia Faulkner, Director of Vocal Studies, and [[Renée Fleming]], Advisor.

A '''miracle of the roses''' is a [[miracle]] in which [[rose]]s manifest an activity of [[God in Christianity|God]] or of a [[saint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lafaye|first=Jacques|year=1987|title=Quetzalcoatl and Guadaloupe: The Formation of Mexican National Consciousness, 1531-1813|pages=55|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn=0-521-42018-0|accessdate=11 December 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWJJua4aoGcC&amp;pg=PA55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a miracle is presented in various [[hagiography|hagiographies]] and [[legend]]s in different forms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klaniczay|first=Gábor|year=2002|title=Holy Rulers and Blessed Princesses: Dynastic Cults in Medieval Central Europe|page=422|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-42018-0|accessdate=11 December 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tz12J0Eb9eUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA422&amp;dq=%22Miracle+of+the+roses%22+%22hagiography%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it occurs in connection with diverse individuals such as Saints [[Elizabeth of Hungary]] (1207–1231), [[Elizabeth of Portugal]] (1271–1336), St. Dorothy, a 4th-century virgin martyr at Caesarea in Cappadocia (died ca. 311), and [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] (appeared in 1531).

==Symbolism of the rose==
[[File:Niccolo Betti San Diego de Alcalá Descalzas Reales - Adobe Reader.jpg|thumb|Niccolo Betti San Diego de Alcalá Descalzas Reales]]
In the Latin West the symbolism of the rose is of Greco-Roman heritage but influenced by and finally transformed through Latin biblical and liturgical texts. In Greco-Roman culture the rose's symbolic qualities represented beauty, the season of spring, and love.  It also spoke of the fleetness of life, and therefore of death.  In Rome the feast called "[[Rosalia (festival)|Rosalia]]" was a feast of the dead: thus the flower referred to the next world.&lt;ref name=koehler&gt;[http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/rosarymarkings36.html Koehler, S.M., Rev. Theodore A., "The Christian Symbolism of the Rose"], ''Roses and the Arts: A Cultural and Horticultural Engagement'', Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio, May 8, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

This symbolism attained a deeper complexity when contrasted with the rose's thorns.  This contrast inspired the Christian Latin poet [[Coelius Sedulius]], who wrote (between 430-450) a very elaborate comparison between [[Eve]], our first mother, and [[Mary, the Mother of Jesus]] our Savior. He illustrated the parallelism already made by [[Justin Martyr]] (around 150) and developed it in a deep poetic and doctrinal liturgical teaching in his Easter song, ''Carmen paschal''.&lt;ref name=koehler/&gt;
[[File:Elisabeth roses.jpg|thumb|140px|left|&lt;center&gt;''St. Elisabeth of Thuringia, Miracle of the roses''&lt;/center&gt;]]
The rose was a privileged symbol for Mary, Queen of heaven and earth.  We see this development later during the Middle Ages, when the rose became an attribute of many other holy women, including [[Elizabeth of Hungary]], [[Elizabeth of Portugal]], [[Casilda of Toledo]], and for the [[martyr]]s in general.  The rose is even a symbol for Christ himself, as seen in the German Christmas song, "es ist ein 'Rose' entsprungen."&lt;ref name=koehler/&gt;

During the Middle Ages the rose was cultivated in monastery gardens and used for medicinal purposes. It became a symbol in religious writing and iconography in different images and settings, to invoke a variety of intellectual and emotional responses.&lt;ref name=carleton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carleton|first=Sarah|title=A rose is a rose is a rose:The Rose as Symbol in the Ars antiqua Motet|journal=Discourses in Music|date=Spring 2004|volume=5|issue=1|url=http://www.discourses.ca/v5n1a1.html|accessdate=15 December 2012|publisher=Univ. of Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mystic rose appears in Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', where it represents God's love. By the twelfth century, the red rose had come to represent [[Passion (Christianity)|Christ's passion]], and the blood of the martyrs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   | last = Wilson  | first = Jean C.  | title = Excavating the Medieval Image: Manuscripts, Artists, Audiences; Essays in Honor of Sandra Hindman  | chapter = 'Richement et pompeusement parée': the ''collier'' of Margaret of York and the politics of love in late medieval Burgundy  | publisher = Ashgate  | year = 2004  | pages = 109–134  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dez8trnjfbUC  | isbn = 978-0-7546-3143-9}} 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common association of the rose is with the Virgin Mary. The third-century [[Saint Ambrose]] believed that there were roses in the Garden of Eden, initially without thorns, but which became thorny after the fall, and came to symbolize [[Original Sin]] itself. Thus the Blessed Virgin is often referred to as the 'rose without thorns', since she was immaculately conceived. Saint [[Bernard of Clairvaux ]] compared her virginity to a white rose and her charity to a red rose. With the rise of Marian devotion and the [[Gothic cathedral]] in the twelfth century, the image of the rose became even more prominent in religious life. Cathedrals built around this time usually include a [[rose window]], dedicated to the Virgin, at the end of a transept or above the entrance. The thirteenth century [[Saint Dominic]] is credited with the institution of the [[Rosary]], a series of prayers to the Virgin, symbolized by garlands of roses worn in Heaven.&lt;ref name=carleton/&gt;

==Saint Elizabeth of Hungary==
[[File:Pietro Nelli - Elizabeth van Hongarije.JPG|thumb|upright|Elisabeth of Hungary with roses]]
In Western Europe, the best-known version of a miracle of the roses concerns Saint Elizabeth of Hungary (also called Elisabeth of Thuringia), the daughter of King [[Andrew II of Hungary]], who spent most of her life living with her in-laws in Germany (a ruling family of [[List of rulers of Thuringia|Thuringia]]), who kept court at [[Wartburg Castle]].&lt;ref name="reber"/&gt;

===Origins===
It has been suggested that the legend originated in a sermon given by [[Caesarius of Heisterbach]] in which he reflects on the occasion of the [[Translation (relics)|translation]] of the remains of Saint Elizabeth, in 1236. Caesarius speaks of a sweet aroma that emanates from the grave as soon as it is opened (a common theme in [[hagiography]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maresch|first=Maria|title=Elisabeth von Thüringen: Schutzfrau des deutschen Volkes|place=Bonn|publisher=Verlag der Buchgemeinde|year=1931|page=220|isbn=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This metaphorical or actual aroma could have been translated into a physical event, the miracle of the roses.&lt;ref name="reber"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reber|first=Ortrud|title=Die heilige Elisabeth: Leben und Legende|place=St. Ottilien|year=1982|ref=Reber1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first report of a miracle resembling that of the roses is by [[Franciscan]]s in the mid-13th century. Their account is of spring flowers, and the event takes place in [[Hungary]], at Elizabeth's home when she was five years old.&lt;ref name="Hohberg72"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hohberg|first=Rainer|last2=Weigelt|first2=Sylvia|title=Brot und Rosen: Das Leben der heiligen Elisabeth in Sagen und Legenden|place=Wartburg|publisher=Wartburg Verlag|year=2006|ref=Hohberg2006|isbn=978-3-86160-183-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The miracle as we know it, with roses and in Germany, is first reported in 1332, in a Franciscan book of prayers,&lt;ref name="reber"/&gt; though it has also been proposed that the miracle was "translated" from Elizabeth of Portugal to Elisabeth of Hungary in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pörnbacher|first=Hans|year=2003|title=Die hl.

===The legend===
In its most characteristic form the legend goes as follows. One day the young but pious Elizabeth, in the company of one or more serving women, descends from [[Wartburg Castle]] down to the village of [[Eisenach]], below the castle. She is carrying meat, eggs, and bread under her mantle. Supposedly she has taken items from the family dining table to distribute to the poor in the village, against the wishes of her family, who frown upon such behavior. Halfway down, she unexpectedly meets her husband [[Ludwig IV of Thuringia]], who asks, upon seeing her bulk, what she is carrying. Embarrassed and speechless as she is, she does not know what to say. Ludwig opens her mantle, and to his surprise (in some versions this takes place in the dead of winter) finds her carrying a bouquet of roses.&lt;ref name="Hohberg72"/&gt;

===Similar versions===

====Saint Elizabeth of Portugal====
Very much the same story is told of [[Elizabeth of Portugal]], also known as Elizabeth of Aragon (1271–4 July 1336), who was the great-niece of Elizabeth of Hungary. Married to the profligate King [[Denis of Portugal]], she, like her great-aunt, showed great devotion at an early age, and likewise was charitable toward the poor, against the wishes of her husband. Caught one day by her husband, while carrying bread in her apron, the food was turned into roses. Since this occurred in January, King Denis reportedly had no response and let his wife continue. The story is somewhat apocryphal; while it shows up in popular versions of the saint's life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Of the 15th-century [[Franciscan]] St. [[Didacus of Alcalá]], also known as San Diego, the same miracle is told: as a lay brother of the Franciscans in Spain, he often took bread from the monastery's dining table to give to the poor.

The story of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] is of an entirely different character, although here again the miraculous presence of the roses in the middle of winter is a sign of the presence of the divinity.

&lt;/ref&gt; It concerns a native inhabitant of [[Mexico]] named [[Juan Diego]], whom the Virgin chooses to convey a message to an unwilling bishop, that "Here I will hear their weeping, their sorrow and will remedy and alleviate all their multiple sufferings, necessities and misfortunes." The bishop however, does not believe Diego's story. He returns to his field, where again the Virgin appears to him, with the same message. Diego again goes to the bishop, with the same result, and the remark that he has to bring a token if he is to be believed. The fourth time the Virgin appears, she directs Diego toward "varied Castilian flowers" which he picks; she then places the flowers in his mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Saint Rita of Cascia ==
[[File:Rapallo-chiesa san Francesco-dipinto4.jpg|thumb|140px|left|&lt;center&gt;St. Rita of Cascia&lt;/center&gt;]]
A miracle involving roses occurred to Saint [[Rita of Cascia]]. The winter before the end of her life, a cousin visited her and asked her if she desired anything from her old home at Roccaporena. Saint Rita responded by asking for a rose and a fig from the garden. It was January and her cousin did not expect to find anything due to the snowy weather. However, when her relative went to the house, a single blooming rose was found in the garden, as well as a fully ripened and edible fig. Her cousin brought the rose and fig back to Saint Rita at the convent, who thanked her and gave the rose to her sisters.

The rose is thought to represent God's love for Rita and Rita's ability to intercede on behalf of lost causes or impossible cases. Rita is often depicted holding roses or with roses nearby, and on her feast day, churches and shrines of Saint Rita provide roses to the congregation that are blessed by priests during [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].

=== Statement of Pope John Paul II ===
On the occasion of the centenary of the canonization of Saint Rita of Cascia, Pope John Paul II stated that the worldwide devotion to Saint Rita is symbolized by the rose, and said: "It is to be hoped that the life of everyone devoted to her will be like the rose picked in the garden of Roccaporena the winter before the saint's death. That is, let it be a life sustained by passionate love for the Lord Jesus; a life capable of responding to suffering and to thorns with forgiveness and the total gift of self, in order to spread everywhere the good odour of Christ (cf. {{bibleverse|2|Cor|2:15|ESV}}) through a consistently lived proclamation of the Gospel."  He added that Saint Rita spiritually offers her rose to each of those he addressed as an exhortation to "live as witnesses to a hope that never disappoints and as missionaries of a life that conquers death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/2000/apr-jun/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20000520_santa-rita_en.html |title= Address of Holy Father John Paul II on the centenary of St. Rita's canonization. |date= 20 May 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Music: What Happened?''''' is a book of [[music journalism|music criticism]] by [[Scott Miller (pop musician)|Scott Miller]], leader of the bands [[Game Theory (band)|Game Theory]] and [[The Loud Family]]. Published in 2010, the book was described by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' as "a well-received critical overview of 53 years of rock history."&lt;ref name=billboard2013/&gt;

== Writing and publication ==
In 2006, [[Scott Miller (pop musician)|Scott Miller]], a songwriter and guitarist who had founded the [[power pop]] bands [[Game Theory (band)|Game Theory]] and [[The Loud Family]], turned his efforts to cataloging his thoughts about the music that had inspired him.&lt;ref name=conner2013/&gt; The writing process began after his decision to take a hiatus from his recording career, following the 2006 release of his penultimate album, ''[[What If It Works?]]'', with The Loud Family and [[Anton Barbeau]].&lt;ref name=yudt-obit/&gt; (A final Game Theory album, ''[[Supercalifragile]]'', was completed after Miller's death and released in 2017.)

Thomas Conner of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote that Scott Miller's "encyclopedic knowledge of pop," upon which his music drew, made the book a "shining example of the auteur ideal&amp;nbsp;... a year-by-year, song-by-song journey from 1957 to this decade, connecting the dots for a macro-perspective on pop."&lt;ref name=conner2013/&gt; For each year, Miller wrote about ten or more of his favorite songs, providing analytical insights and placing the songs in context in the musical world of their era.&lt;ref name=mwh2010/&gt;

Miller had kept annual countdown lists of his favorite records throughout his life,&lt;ref name=rollingstone2013/&gt; and his personal project of compiling those lists onto CDs evolved into a formal endeavor to explain what made those songs noteworthy, for what was then the last 50 years of recorded music.&lt;ref name=amar-mwh/&gt; Portions of the book were serially published in draft form on Miller's official web site, where Miller responded to fan requests by writing about one year at a time, in random order.&lt;ref name=mwh2010/&gt;

The book was first published in 2010 by an imprint of [[125 Records]], the recording label to which Miller was signed. In second and third editions of the book, Miller's 2010 chapter&lt;ref name=mwh2010ch/&gt; and 2011 chapter&lt;ref name=mwh2011ch/&gt; were added.

The cover art, designed by Betsy Lescosky, established a knowledgeable but humorous tone by featuring photographs of Miller in poses that recreated noteworthy album covers such as that of [[Liz Phair]]'s ''[[Exile in Guyville]]''.&lt;ref name=mwh2010/&gt; The book's title is a comical appropriation from the sensationalist [[Elvis Presley]] exposé, ''[[Elvis: What Happened?]]'' (1977)&lt;ref name=dontall/&gt;

== Approach to music criticism ==
Reacting to the state of pop music criticism, Miller suggested, "Part of the problem is that a lot of vital pop music is made by 22-year-olds who enjoy shock value, and it's pathetic when their elders are cornered into unalloyed reverence." Miller suggested that critics could navigate this problem by being prepared "to give young artists credit for terrific music without being intimidated into a frame of mind where dark subject matter always gets a passing grade," stating that a critic should be able to call a young artist "a musical genius" while "in the same breath declaring that his or her lyrics are morally objectionable."&lt;ref name=mwh2010/&gt;

Miller identified a major issue as critics' failure to "credit an artist with getting a feeling across," citing critic [[Lester Bangs]] as an emotional writer who nonetheless "never really related to his favorite artists as people who develop a skill of conveying feelings. You don't feel that he comfortably acknowledged being moved as a result of their honest work. Artists in his writing were vaguely ridiculous, fascinating primitives, embodying an archetype by accident of nature."&lt;ref name=mwh2010 /&gt; Based on past experience as an artist receiving criticism, Miller argued against critics' efforts to maintain journalistic distance or objectivity, suggesting that "acknowledging and respecting readers' stylistic boundaries and keeping their own sentimentality in check" was counterproductive, and hypothesizing that instead, "readers actually want a critic to be their friend by listening ''through'' stylistic boundaries with special gold-seeking ears, and reporting how they unexpectedly turned into a love-struck adolescent over a vocal harmony or a piano run... digging the truth of musical experience out from under half-asleep habits of discussing it."&lt;ref name=mwh2010/&gt;

''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]''′s Tracy Moore, in 2014, suggested that one of the virtues of writing about how music made one feel, in contrast with linking it to the sounds of other artists, was to avoid excluding readers who may not have musical knowledge as broad as that of the writer.&lt;ref name=moore2014 /&gt; In contrast, Miller believed that analytical readers would appreciate "more music talk in music criticism," suggesting that "sensitively modest doses" of musical analysis would provide helpful support for a conclusion "that great melody writing occurred or it didn't."  For example, Miller noted that critics rarely "identify catchy melodies as specific passages within a song," in the way that working musicians might discuss "the A-minor in the second measure of the chorus."&lt;ref name=mwh2010/&gt; According to the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', the book "is mostly about the act of listening, but a fair amount of musician talk comes into play, and Miller deploys it gracefully.... As a nonplayer I don't always get his more technical notes, but they're never alienating."&lt;ref name=matos2011/&gt;

== Critical response ==
In response to the book, rock critic [[Robert Christgau]] wrote, "The way [Miller] describes the songs he loves... is tremendously suggestive. If only he or some acolyte could spin a worldview around those observations, we might really have something to go on."&lt;ref name=christgau2010-blurb/&gt;

In a book review in ''[[Ugly Things]]'' magazine, Miller was described as "a sort of fourth-generation rock and roll renaissance man capable of making the printed page jump and sing as deftly as the complex conversations that his [[Gibson Les Paul|Les Paul]] conducts with a [[Marshall stack]]."&lt;ref name=kanis2011/&gt; Musician [[Stephin Merritt]] wrote that Miller "manages actual humor (a first in music criticism) and major insights that may change the way you think about, for example, 1967. Almost a new art form."&lt;ref name=merritt2010-blurb/&gt;

According to music writer Jordan Oakes, "Not only does Miller totally acquit himself as a rock critic, he's produced one of the most interesting compendiums of music journalism since Robert Christgau's ''Rock Music of the '70s''.&lt;ref name=oakes2011/&gt; Oakes called the book "an indispensable collection of rock criticism," and praised Miller's writing style as "great ... very alive, specific and entertaining. He seems influenced by Christgau, occasionally swept away by his own analytics, whimsical at the expense of accuracy, and compulsively iconoclastic. But that almost always makes for fun—never dull—reading."&lt;ref name=oakes2011/&gt;

Miller is the subject of a 2015 biography by rock critic [[Brett Milano]], titled ''[[Don't All Thank Me at Once|Don't All Thank Me at Once: The Lost Genius of Scott Miller]]''.&lt;ref name=rft2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=dontall/&gt; Milano described the book as one that not only tells the story of Miller and his bands [[Game Theory (band)|Game Theory]] and [[The Loud Family]], but also explores "the college and indie-rock explosion of the 1980s and 1990s," and how some influential artists "managed to fall through the cracks."&lt;ref name=rft2015/&gt;

{{Infobox hieroglyphs
|name = &lt;hiero&gt;nfr&lt;/hiero&gt; &lt;ref name="Wörterbuch"&gt;[[Adolf Erman|Erman, Adolf]], and [[Hermann Grapow]], eds. 1926&amp;ndash;1953. ''Wörterbuch der aegyptischen Sprache im Auftrage der deutschen Akademien''. 6 vols. Leipzig: J. C. Hinrichs'schen Buchhandlungen. (Reprinted Berlin: Akademie-Verlag GmbH, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;
|name explanation = Nefer&lt;br/&gt;nfr&lt;br/&gt;'''Good/Beautiful'''
|}}

The [[Egyptian hieroglyph]] for "good, pleasant, well, [[beauty|beautiful]]" in [[Gardiner's sign list]] is numbered '''F35'''; its phonetic value is '''''{{lang|egy-Latn|nfr}}''''', with a reconstructed pronunciation of {{IPA-all|nafir}}&lt;ref&gt;Loprieno, Antonio. ''Ancient Egyptian: A linguistic introduction''. Cambridge University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Egyptian_language#Egyptological_pronunciation|conventional Egyptological vocalization]] of '''''{{lang|egy-Latn|nefer}}'''''.

==Hieroglyphs and symbolism==
The [[Egyptian triliteral signs|triliteral Egyptian hieroglyph]] F35 ('nfr') has sometimes been explained as a representation of a [[lute]]; however, Egyptologists today no longer consider this hypothesis likely. Rather than a lute, the hieroglyph is actually a representation of the [[heart]] and [[trachea]].&lt;ref name="Wörterbuch" /&gt; It originally may have been the [[esophagus]] and heart. The striations of the [[windpipe]] only appear in the hieroglyph following the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt]]. The lower part of the sign has always clearly been the heart, for the markings clearly follow the form of a [[sheep]]'s heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptianmyths.net/nefer.htm|title=Ancient Egypt: the Mythology - Nefer (Beauty)|website=www.egyptianmyths.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
The term ''{{lang|egy-Latn|nfr}}'' has been incorporated into many names in Ancient Egypt. Examples include [[Nefertiti]], [[Nefertari]], and [[Neferhotep]].

The term was consecutively extremely positive considering that it refers to the heart, which to the ancient egyptians was the home of feelings and intent (good and bad).

Some scholars suggest that it was used in ancient Egyptian construction where 'nfrw' was used to denote 'level zero' of a building and in accounting where 'nfr' would refer to a zero balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lumpkin|first=Beatrice|date=1 March 2002|title=Mathematics Used in Egyptian Construction and Bookkeeping|url=https://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=0&amp;sid=08da3089-acff-49b7-b673-fff93c51f7a3%40sessionmgr4006|journal=Mathematical Intelligencer|volume=24|pages=20 - 23|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was used as a prefix of the name Neferpitou which comes from an Egyptian god, [[Nefertem]], in the anime series ''[[Hunter x Hunter]]'' (2011).

==Pharaoh==
'''Nefer''' was an ancient [[Egypt]]ian pharaoh who ruled for two years, one month, and a day, from 2197–2193 BCE&lt;!--should this be 2195?--&gt;, according to the [[Turin Canon]], though he reigned during the reign of [[Pepi II Neferkare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Turin King List |url=http://www.ancient-egypt.org/history/turin_kinglist/0401_0417.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616112943/http://ancient-egypt.org/history/turin_kinglist/0401_0417.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 June 2006 |date=25 July 2009 |work=The Ancient Egypt Site |publisher=Jacques Kinnaer |accessdate=27 August 2009 }} IV,10: Nefer.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Old King's Head Hotel''' is a hotel and [[public house]] at 48–50 Lower Bridge Street, on the corner of Castle Street, [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England.  It is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;II* [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].&lt;ref name=nhl&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376307|desc= The Old Kings Head Hotel, Chester|accessdate= 30 October 2011|mode=cs2|ps=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The building was constructed in about 1208.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;  It was the town house for Peter the Clerk, the administrator of [[Chester Castle]].&lt;ref name=lang&gt;{{Citation |editor1-last= Langtree|editor1-first= Stephen|editor2-last= Comyns|editor2-first= Alan| year = 2001| title = 2000 Years of Building: Chester's Architectural Legacy| publication-place = Chester| place = | publisher = Chester Civic Trust| pages = | page = 63| format = | id = | isbn = 0-9540152-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It initially contained a section of the [[Chester Rows]], but these were enclosed during the alterations made between the 15th and early 17th&amp;nbsp;centuries.  The latest of these alterations were made for [[Randle Holme#Randle Holme I (1570/71–1655)|Randle Holme&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;  The building was restored in 1935,&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt; and again during the 1960s.&lt;ref name=lang/&gt;

==Architecture==

It is basically a [[timber framing|timber-framed]] building, part of which has been refaced with yellow [[sandstone]], and with brick that has been painted or [[Cement render|rendered]]. The roofs are [[slate]]d.   The building is in three storeys, of which the upper storey facing Lower Bridge Street is [[jettying|jettied]].  Both faces have three [[bay (architecture)|bays]].  The three bays on Lower Bridge Street are [[gable]]d, as is the middle bay on Castle Street.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;

They apply principles used in organizing communities developing open-source software for organizing group efforts innovating with human culture. New open-source religions may develop their rituals, praxes, or systems of beliefs through a continuous process of refinement and dialogue among participating practitioners. Organizers and participants often see themselves as part of a more generalized [[free culture movement|open-source and free-culture movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crumm |first1=David |title=Open Source Religion |url=http://zero.newassignment.net/assignmentzero/open_source_religion |website=Assignment Zero |publisher=Assignment Zero |accessdate=22 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103115009/http://zero.newassignment.net/assignmentzero/open_source_religion |archivedate=January 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==

In 1994, with his essay, "The Holy War: Mac vs. DOS," the scholar and novelist [[Umberto Eco]] popularized the use of religious metaphors in comparing [[operating system]] design and user experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eco|first1=Umberto|title=The Holy War: Mac vs. DOS|journal=Espresso|date=September 30, 1994|url=http://cliffarnold.com/macvdos.pdf|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1990s, the term "open-source religion" began appearing in technology magazines as a reference to the open-source [[Linux]] operating system's organizing principle and as an analogy for highlighting the philosophical differences between advocates of open-source vs. proprietary software .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liebmann|first1=Lenny|title=Say Hello to the 'Lintel' Reformation|journal=Computerworld|date=May 10, 1999|volume=33|issue=19|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90foRW8FHpkC&amp;pg=PT31&amp;dq=%22Open+Source+Religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KIAAVfW0JYmbyQSr6IHIBA&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foster|first1=Ed|title=Apple padlocks UI decor|journal=InfoWorld|date=June 6, 2001|volume=23|issue=24|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_TgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=%22Open+Source+Religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KIAAVfW0JYmbyQSr6IHIBA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, [[Daniel Kriegman]] began describing a religion he invented called Ozacua (later Yoism) as "the world's first opensource religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ozacua: the Living Religion (5 April 2001) |url=http://www.ozacua.com/ |website=ozacua.com |publisher=Daniel Kriegman |accessdate=11 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010419072235/http://www.ozacua.com/ |archivedate=April 19, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lovink|first1=Geert|title=Dark Fiber: Tracking Critical Internet Culture|date=2002|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-12249-9|page=334|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p_7YWf9WpwYC&amp;pg=PA334&amp;dq=%22Open+Source+Religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KIAAVfW0JYmbyQSr6IHIBA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=religion&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of an "open source religion" was further expanded upon by the media theorist, [[Douglas Rushkoff]] in his book, ''Nothing's Sacred: The Truth about Judaism'' (2003), where he offered the following description as an introduction to [[Open Source Judaism]]:
:An open source religion would work the same way as open source software development: it is not kept secret or mysterious at all. Everyone contributes to the codes we use to comprehend our place in the universe. We allow our religion to evolve based on the active participation of its people....An open source relationship to religion would likewise take advantage of the individual points of view of its many active participants to develop its more resolved picture of the world and our place within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rushkoff|first=Douglas|title=Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism|year=2004|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=USA|page=111|isbn=1400051398|url=http://www.rushkoff.com/nothing-sacred/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discordianism, Copyleft, and open-source software===
[[File:Principia Discordia page "00075-Page 00088".jpg|thumb|Page of the Principia Discordia that includes the following Copyright disclaimer, "Ⓚ ALL RIGHTS REVERSED – Reprint what you like," the earliest example of what would become a declaration of [[copyleft]].]]
[[File:Circled latin capital letter k.svg|thumb|Discordian reference to the mythological Kallisti, or [[Apple of Discord]], by way of a kosher food symbol in place of a conventional Copyright symbol.]]
Before the coinage of the term [[open-source]] in 1998 or even the birth of the [[Free Software]] movement, the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', a [[Discordian]] religious text written by [[Malaclypse the Younger|Greg Hill]] with [[Kerry Wendell Thornley]], included the following Copyright disclaimer in its 4th edition (1970), "Ⓚ ALL RIGHTS REVERSED – Reprint what you like." By the summer of 1970, the implications of the disclaimer were being discussed in other [[Underground Press|underground publications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clutterbuck|first1=Brenton|title=Chasing Eris: An Interlude on Copyleft|url=http://historiadiscordia.com/chasing-eris-an-interlude-on-copyleft/|website=Historia Discordia|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Commercial publishers are not likely to be interested in the ''Principia'' due, at least, to the counter copyright on it–for, if they had a good seller, then other publishers could print it out from under them. Consequently publication and distribution will have to occur spontaneously, thru the “underground”, as alternative cultures learn to meet their own needs and provide their own services. This non-commercial limitation of the ''Principia'' is to provide less limitations in other respects, and it is not an accident. The ''Principia'' is not simply a handbook, it is a demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Greater Poop|date=July–August 1970|issue=30|page=1|url=http://historiadiscordia.com/greg-hills-discordian-newsletter-the-greater-poop/greg_hill-197007_08-the_greater_poop-poop30_page_00001/|accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Via the counterculture, by the mid-1970s, the concept had influenced a generation of Discordians including the nascent hacker culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buxton|first1=Kristin|title=The Lifecycle of the Principia Discordia: The dissemination of the religion disguised as a joke and joke disguised as a religion|url=http://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/articles/principia-discordia|website=The Lazarus Corporation|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project to create [[Tiny BASIC]] was proposed in Bob Albrecht and [[Dennis Allison]]'s ''[[Dr. Dobb's Journal|Dr. Dobb's Journal of Tiny BASIC Calisthenics &amp; Orthodontia]]'', a journal of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]], a small group of computer hobbyists who began meeting in 1975 around [[Silicon Valley]]. The first lines of the source code for Tiny Basic as released in 1976 by [[Li-Chen Wang]] stated ‘(ↄ) COPYLEFT ALL WRONGS RESERVED’. In 1984/5 programmer [[Don Hopkins]] sent [[Richard Stallman]] a letter labeled "[[Copyleft]]—[[all rights reversed]]". Stallman chose the phrase to identify his free software method of distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution |last= Stallman |first= Richard  |year= 1999 |publisher= O'Reilly Media |isbn= 1-56592-582-3 |pages= 59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between Discordianism and "Kopyleft" remain part of the culture of Discordianism, as explained by the Discordian Rev. Dr. Jon Swabey in his ''Apocrypha Discordia.''
:Discordianism and the concept of KopyLeft go hand in hand. Although just a small part of the counter-culture gestalt, I believe that the ''Principia Discordia'' was probably one of the earliest expressions and strongest champions of this idea, which has since seen such concepts as the [[Open Source Software]] initiative, with endeavours such as the [[Linux]] Operating System.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swabey|first1=Jon|title=Apocrypha Discordia|date=2001|url=http://www.23ae.com/files/apocrypha2.pdf|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open-source in established religious traditions==
For established traditions whose canonical works, records of discourse, and inspired artworks reside in the [[public domain]], keeping these works open and available in the face of proprietary interests has inspired several open-source initiatives. Open access to resources and [[adaptive reuse]] of shared materials under [[open content]] licensing provide a structure by which communities can innovate new religious systems collaboratively under the aegis of copyright law. For some religious movements, however, [[public access]] and [[literacy]], and the potential of adaptive reuse also provide an opportunity for innovation and reform within established traditions. In an interview by [[Alan Jacobs (academic)|Alan Jacobs]] in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' magazine on open-source religion, Aharon Varady (founding director of the [[Open Siddur Project]]) explained that "cultures breathe creativity like we breathe oxygen" arguing that open-source provides one possible strategy for keeping a tradition vibrant while also preserving historical works as non-proprietary during a period of transition from analog to digital media.&lt;ref  name="jacobs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobs|first=Alan|title=The Potential and Promise of Open-Source Judaism|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/06/the-potential-and-promise-of-open-source-judaism/258394/|work=The Atlantic Magazine Online|publisher=The Atlantic Magazine|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open-source Judaism===
Although a work of radical 1960s Jewish counterculture rather than an explicitly religious work, the satirical songbook ''Listen to the mocking bird'' (Times Change Press, 1971) by [[the Fugs]]' [[Tuli Kupferberg|Naphtali "Tuli" Kupferberg]] contains the earliest explicit mention of "copyleft" in a copyright disclaimer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kupferberg|first1=Naphtali|title=Listen to the Mocking Bird: Satiric Songs to Tunes You Know|date=1971|publisher=Times Change Press|location=Washington, New Jersey|url=https://archive.org/stream/2917619.0001.001.umich.edu#page/2/mode/2up|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Open Source Judaism|open-source efforts in Judaism]] begin to appear in 1988 with the [[free software]] code written for calculating the Hebrew calendar included in [[Emacs]]. After the popularization of the term "[[open-source]]" in 1998, essays and manifestos linking open-source and Judaism began appearing in 2002 among Jewish thinkers familiar with trends in new media and open-source software. In August 2002, Aharon Varady proposed the formation of an "[[Open Siddur Project|Open Siddur]]," an open-source licensed [[user-generated content]] project for digitizing liturgical materials and writing the code needed for the [[web-to-print]] publishing of [[Siddur]]im (Jewish prayer books).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Varady |first1=Aharon |title=update 2002-08-08 |url=http://aharon.varady.net/omphalos/2002/08/update-2002-08-08 |website=Aharon's Omphalos |publisher=Aharon Varady |accessdate=16 June 2014 }} and {{cite web|last=Varady |first=Aharon |title=The Open Siddur Project |url=http://varady.net/open_siddur/ |work=Aharon Varady's Homepage |publisher=The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine |accessdate=5 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021013153654/http://varady.net/open_siddur/ |archivedate=October 13, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, media theorist [[Douglas Rushkoff]] began articulating his understanding of open-source in Judaism. "The object of the game, for me," Rushkoff explained, "was to recontextualize Judaism as an entirely Open Source proposition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rushkoff |first1=Douglas |title=Open-Source Religion |url=http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/features/44075/OpenSource_Religion.html |website=G4 TV - The Screen Savers |publisher=G4 TV |accessdate=23 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312093353/http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/features/44075/OpenSource_Religion.html |archivedate=March 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Open-Source Judaism.svg|thumb|Open-Source Judaism logo]]
The term "Open Source Judaism" first appeared in [[Douglas Rushkoff]]'s book ''Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism'' (2003). Rushkoff employed the term "Open Source" to describe a democratic organizational model for collaborating in a commonly held source: the [[Hebrew Bible]] and other essential works of [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. Rushkoff conceived of Judaism as essentially an open-source religion which he conceived as, "the contention that religion is not a pre-existing truth but an ongoing project. It may be divinely inspired, but it is a creation of human beings working together. A collaboration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rushkoff|first=Douglas|title=Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism|year=2004|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=USA|isbn=1400051398|url=http://www.rushkoff.com/nothing-sacred/}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Rushkoff, open-source offered the promise of enacting change through a new culture of collaboration and improved access to sources. "Anyone who wants to do Judaism should have access to Judaism. Judaism is not just something that you do, it's something you enact. You've got to learn the code in order to alter it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lehmann-Haupt|first=Rachel|title=Is Judaism Becoming Irrelevant?|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/16146/is_judaism_becoming_irrelevant|accessdate=7 December 2013|newspaper=AlterNet|date=2003-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2003 publication of Rushkoff's book ''Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.rushkoff.com/nothingsacred.html|title=Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism|author=Douglas Rushkoff|publisher=Three Rivers Press|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an online forum dedicated to "Open Source Judaism" inspired several online projects in creating web applications for generating custom made [[haggadah|haggadot]] for [[Passover]], however neither content nor code for these were shared under [[free content|free-culture]] [[license compatibility|compatible]] [[open content]] terms.

Beginning with the [[Open Siddur Project]] in 2009, open-source projects in Judaism began to publicly share their software code with open-source licenses and their content with [[free content|free-culture]] [[license compatibility|compatible]] [[open content]] licenses. The explicit objectives of these projects also began to differ from Rushkoff's "Open Source Judaism." Rather than seek reforms in religious practices or doctrines, these projects used Open Content licenses to empower users to access and create their own resources from a common store of canonical texts and associated translations and metadata. By 2012, [[Open Source Judaism|open-source projects in Judaism]] were mainly active in facilitating collaboration in sharing resources for transcribing and translating existing works in the Public Domain, and for adaptation and dissemination of works being shared by copyright owners under Open Content licenses.&lt;ref name="jacobs"/&gt;

===Open-source Yoga===
Following proprietary claims on Yoga movements by some Yoga instructors, Open Source Yoga Unity was formed in 2003 to assert that Yoga movements reside in the [[public domain]]. The organization provides a common voice, and the pooling of resources, to legally resist the application of a proprietary [[Copyright]] to any Yoga style thereby "ensuring its continued natural unfettered practice for all to enjoy and develop." The organization explains, that "while we appreciate the teachings of yoga teachers, we do not believe that they have the legal right to impose control over another's Yoga teaching or practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Open Source Yoga Unity|url=https://www.facebook.com/yogaunity/info?tab=page_info|website=Open Source Yoga Unity Facebook Page|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Open Source Yoga Unity v. Bikram Choudhury (2005), the organization settled out of court, avoiding a federal court hearing to determine whether Bikram Choudhury’s copyrighted sequence of 26 poses and two breathing exercises could be legally protected.&lt;ref&gt;Open Source Yoga Unity v. Bikram Choudhury (N.D. Cal., 4/1/05, No. C 03–3182 PJH)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open-source Wicca===
Concerned with the lack of a source text containing documentation on [[Wicca]] in the tradition of [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], Dr. [[Leo Ruickbie]] self-published ''Open Source Wicca: The Gardnerian Tradition'' (2007) for "putting you back in control of spirituality." The work, a collection of "the original foundation documents of Wicca" authored between 1949 and 1961, was published [http://www.witchology.com/contents/opensourcewicca/gardnerianindex.php digitally] and in print under a [[Creative Commons]] [[Attribution (copyright)|Attribution]] license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruickbie|first1=Leo|title=Open Source Wicca|url=http://p2pfoundation.net/Open_Source_Wicca|publisher=Leo Ruickbie|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open-source in establishing new religions==
Several projects aiding individuals and communities in formulating their own belief systems cite inspiration from ideas common to the [[open-source movement]] and self-identify as open-source religions or religious initiatives. The establishment of new religions through open-source methods is closely related to [[chaos magic]], which emphasizes the pragmatic use of belief systems and the creation of new and unorthodox methods,&lt;ref name="New Encyclopedia of the Occult"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greer|first=John Michael|title=The New Encyclopedia of the Occult|year=2003|publisher=Llewellyn Publications|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=9781567183368|pages=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; the difference being that any knowledge gained through such innovation is shared openly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=A.o.C.|first1=Fra.|title=Open Source Magic|url=http://osogd.org/library/the-aerodynamic-biscuits/142-2/|publisher=Open Source Order of the Golden Dawn|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yoism===

===Human Worship===

Human Worship, or Open Religion, is an "eternal tradition of considering [[Human]] absolute, highest value", "considering God as Human continuation to infinity through Soul", described in its sacred book, shared in [[public domain]] by the formula "[[All rights reserved]] for [[God]]. Open Soul Holy [[Scripture]] of Human Worship is word of God, common heritage of Humankind, published anonymously, free for copying".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Soul: Holy Scripture of Human Worship|url=https://www.academia.edu/34660139/Open_Soul_Holy_Scripture_of_Human_Worship|website=Academia.edu|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blessing gesture and sacred sign of Open Religion is the [[circle]] or [[zero]],  with the human in the center of [[coordinates]]. Human Worshippers bow to every human [[soul]], laying the hand on [[heart]] and saying "Believe in yourself!". They organize "soul societies" for [[missionary]] work, [[friendship]], [[love]] and common [[joy]]. Also they believe in every human  having the capacity to be a [[prophet]], every human action to be [[prayer]] and all consequences as [[revelation]] from God, claiming that practical experience inspires true [[faith]] and [[skeptics]] are the same holy persons as prophets.

==Cleveland Opera==
Cleveland Opera was incorporated by David Bamberger, Carola Bamberger, and John D. Heavenrich in March 1976 and presented its first season in October and November of that year with sold-out productions of [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' and [[Gioacchino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''[[The Barber of Seville]]''. By 1984, it had become the resident opera company at [[Playhouse Square]], with performances at the [[State Theatre (Cleveland, Ohio)|State Theater]].  The company played an integral part in the revitalization of Cleveland's historic Cleveland Theater District and was a leader in the movement to make theaters accessible to the physically challenged.  There was considerable overlap between the orchestra personnel of the Cleveland Opera, Cleveland Ballet, and the Ohio Chamber Orchestra, to the advantage of all three organizations.

The company was managed from March 1976 to April 2004 by David Bamberger as General Director and Carola Bamberger as Associate Director.  In that period, it presented 122 full productions of 74 works by 43 different composers spanning the history of musical theater from Monteverdi to the present.  Its casts included some of opera's greatest artists, among whom were [[Roberta Peters]], [[Jerome Hines]], [[Sherrill Milnes]], and (in concert) [[Plácido Domingo]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]], and [[José Carreras]].

In addition to operas and operettas, Cleveland Opera presented several [[musical theatre]] favorites, such as ''[[West Side Story]]'', ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'' and ''[[My Fair Lady]].''   It received international attention by commissioning and presenting a world premiere opera by a noted Rock musician, [[Stewart Copeland]] of "[[The Police]]", with his opera ''Holy Blood and Crescent Moon''.  The company was also noted for “Cleveland Opera on Tour,” an extensive education and outreach program.  It was a member of [[OPERA America]],  a national organization which oversees and helps the development of opera across the North American continent.

==Opera Cleveland==
Following the departure of David Bamberger, the company pursued financial policies that weakened it considerably.  The decision was made to merge with another struggling company that operated largely in the summer, Lyric Opera Cleveland. The merged company was named Opera Cleveland and gave its first staged production in April 2007.  Mismanagement plagued the company, however, and it became defunct in the fall of 2010.

==Similar Names==
In subsequent years, two small Cleveland companies changed their names to incorporate the words "Cleveland Opera." In 2014, "Opera per tutti" became "Cleveland Opera Theater" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleveland.com/musicdance/index.ssf/2014/12/opera_per_tutti_relaunches_wit.html&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 2017, "Opera Circle" became "The Cleveland Opera."&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.cleveland.com/musicdance/index.ssf/2017/03/opera_circle_cleveland_stakes.html&lt;/ref&gt; Neither institution is connected to the organization described above.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2090">In the fields of [[bibliography]] and [[bookselling]], '''prize books''' (also known as '''prize bindings'''), are a category of finely bound books once given as prizes and awards in educational institutions primarily in [[England]], [[Ireland]], and the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=John |date= September 1989|title=Reviewed Work: Gold-Tooled Bookbindings Commissioned by Trinity College, Dublin in the Eighteenth Century. (Studies in the History of Irish Bookbinding: 1) by Joseph McDonnell and Patrick Healy |url= |journal= The Burlington Magazine  |volume=131  |issue=1038  |pages=656–657 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition flourished in Latin schools in continental [[Europe]] from the mid-17th century until the introduction of publishers bindings after about 1830. Books continued to be given as prizes at academic ceremonies, but the only distinguishing feature are typically special inscriptions and/or [[bookplates]].

==History in UK==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the tradition of special prize bindings persisted until the mid-20th century with the demise of traditional hand binding. Most titles consist of classical works in the [[humanities]] published in unbound print runs for this purpose. Schools would contract with a local [[bindery]] to prepare prize editions stamped or [[Paper embossing|embossed]] with the logo of the school. The editions are often made to resemble the fine bindings of the 18th century and are prized by booksellers for their classical appearance. They are often mistaken as ex-school library books but can be distinguished by a prize inscription, lack of [[call number]], and general higher quality of the binding.

'''R.R. Bowker LLC''' ("Bowker") is an [[United States|American]] limited liability company based in [[New Providence, New Jersey]], and incorporated in [[Delaware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/78506-bowker-investigating-breach-of-isbn-site.html|title=Bowker Investigating  Breach of ISBN Site|work=PublishersWeekly.com|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, Bowker provides bibliographic information on published works to the book trade, including publishers, booksellers, libraries, and individuals; its roots in the industry trace back to 1868. Bowker is the exclusive U.S. agent for issuing [[International Standard Book Number|International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs)]], a universal method of identifying books in print.  Bowker is the publisher of '''''Books in Print''''' and other compilations of information about books and [[periodical]] titles. It provides [[supply chain]] services and analytical tools to the book publishing industry.&lt;ref name="Milliot" /&gt; Bowker is headquartered in [[New Providence, New Jersey]], with additional operational offices in England and Australia.  It is now owned by [[Cambridge Information Group]].

==History==
The company was founded by [[Frederick Leypoldt]], a German immigrant who worked as a [[bookselling|bookseller]] and recognized the need for good [[bibliographic]] information to make the book business more efficient. He established the monthly ''Literary Bulletin,'' his first periodical, in 1868. In 1870 Leypoldt issued the first edition of his ''Annual American Catalogue'', the forerunner for ''Books In Print''. In 1872 he published the first issue of ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', in 1873 the first ''Publishers' Uniform Trade-List Annual'' (later the ''Publishers Trade List Annual''), and in 1876 the first issue of ''[[Library Journal]]''. In 1878 Leypoldt's company was acquired by [[Richard Rogers Bowker]]. Leypoldt and Bowker also founded two influential standard book-industry references: ''Literary Marketplace'' and ''[[Ulrich's Periodicals Directory]]''.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Info Science"/&gt;

In 1967, the [[Xerox Corporation]] acquired the R. R. Bowker company, and then, in 1985, sold it to Reed International (now [[Reed Elsevier]]). That same year, in 1985, ''Publishers Weekly''—after 113 years as a part of R.R. Bowker—was transferred to the [[Cahners Publishing Company]].  In 2001, [[Cambridge Information Group]] acquired Bowker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cambridge Information Group Timeline |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141020173911/http://www.ulib.niu.edu/publishers/CIG.htm |deadurl=yes |archivedate=October 2014 |url=http://www.ulib.niu.edu/publishers/index.htm |work=The Academic Publishing Industry: A Story of Merger and Acquisition |author= Mary H. Munroe |year=2004 |via= Northern Illinois University }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, [[Cambridge Information Group]] merged [[Cambridge Scientific Abstracts]] with [[ProQuest|ProQuest Information and Learning]] to form [[ProQuest|ProQuest LLC]], a privately held limited liability company based in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], and incorporated in Delaware.  R. R. Bowker LLC was repositioned as an [[Affiliate (commerce)|affiliate]] of ProQuest.{{clarify|date=April 2014}}&lt;ref name="ProQuest site"/&gt;

== Selected publications ==
* ''Books in Print'' lists nearly all books that are currently available in English and in the United States from major publishers. A resource for bookstores, libraries, and publishers, it is available in a print version, but is most often accessed electronically.  Books in Print listings are several million, a number that is only exceeded by Amazon.
* ''The Library and Book Trade Almanac'' (formerly ''The Bowker Annual'') is a resource for librarians, publishers, and booksellers which provides reviews of "key trends, events, and developments" in the industry; statistics on book prices, numbers of books published, library expenditures, and average salaries; explanations of new legislation and changes in funding programs; and other information.&lt;ref name="Book Trade Almanac"/&gt;
* ''[[Books+Publishing]]'' is an Australian trade magazine for the publishing industry.

==Services==
Bowker is the United States provider of [[International Standard Book Number]]s (ISBNs), a code for identifying commercial books devised by [[Gordon Foster]] in 1967.  An ISBN is currently placed on a book to uniquely identify it. ISBNs are available one at a time and in blocks up to 100,000 for a set fee.&lt;ref name="Friedlander"/&gt;  ISBNs may be purchased and maintained at Bowker's My Identifiers website. Many countries, including the UK, Italy, Germany, Spain, to name a few, charge for ISBNs. Canada and Mexico provide ISBNs free of charge as their ISBN agencies are government funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government of Canada|title=ISBN Canada|url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/services/isbn-canada/pages/isbn-canada.aspx|website=Library and Archives Canada|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government of Mexico|title=Agencia Nacional ISBN México|url=http://www.indautor.sep.gob.mx/isbn|website=Secretaria de Cultura|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowker USA charges $125 for one ISBN&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Purchase ISBNs|url=https://www.myidentifiers.com/get-your-isbn-now|website=Bowker|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offers substantial discounts on volume purchases.

R.R. Bowker said it has learned that unauthorized charges were occurring on cards after they were legitimately used on its www[.]myidentifiers[.]com website, which is responsible for issuing ISBNs.

Apart from being one of the political novels in the Philippines from 1967 to 1972 that "represented a clamor for change in society" (Filipino: ''kinatawan ng paghingi ng pagbabago sa lipunan''), ''Satanas sa Lupa'' was one of the novels in the Philippines that incorporated romanticism in its plot using the "[[love triangle]]" (Filipino: ''tatsulukan ng pag-ibig'') genre, a genre that began in the Philippines in  1906 through another novel entitled ''[[Juan Masili]]'' by another Filipino author named [[Patricio Mariano]].  The love triangle in ''Satanas sa Lupa'' is  between the characters Benigno Talavera, Conrado and Chona.&lt;ref name=Panitikan&gt;{{cite web|title="Romantisismo, Estilong Pilipino" Itinatak sa Nobelang Tagalog|first=Ruby|last=Gamboa-Alcantara|url=http://panitikan.com.ph/criticism/romantisismo.htm|accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
According to Ruby Gamboa-Alcantara in her''"Romantisismo, Estilong Pilipino" Itinatak sa Nobelang Tagalog'' ("Romanticism, Filipino Style" Stamped on the Tagalog Novel), the character Benigno Talavera was the representative of Philippine politics in ''Satanas sa Lupa''. Talavera was a "formerly good citizen" who was influenced by three other Congressmen (Filipino: ''Konggresista'') Carpio, David, and Balbino.  The three were cheating each other for the sake of climbing up the ladder of power and for gaining wealth.  In ''Satanas sa Lupa'', the reign of greed was ended by the persecution of Senator Morales, the death of Talavera, and the burning of evidences used to [[blackmail]] Talavera.  The evidences were burned by Talavera's wife, Virginia.  The other circumstances presented in ''Satanas sa Lupa'' were the drug addiction of Ismael, the son of Talavera; the pregnancy out of wedlock and motherhood as a single woman by Esther, the daughter of Talavera; the love affair between Contrado and Chona; and the [[elopement]] of Conrado and Chona (Conrado was supposed to become a priest).  According to Gamboa-Alcantara, there is an unrealistic circumstance in ''Satanas sa Lupa'', which is the excessive portrayal of Virginia, the wife of Talavera, as the martyred spouse and mother, due to the use of Philippine-style romanticism.&lt;ref name=Panitikan/&gt;

The '''Great Seal of the State of Hawaii''' was designated officially by Act 272 of the 1959 Territorial Legislature and is based on the territorial seal.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://hawaii.gov/hidocs/hawaiinames.html Names and Insignia of Hawaii&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Modifications to the territorial seal included the use of the words "[[Hawaii|State of Hawaii]]" at the top and "1959" within the circle. Provisions for a seal for the state of Hawaii was enacted by the Territorial Legislator and approved by Governor [[William F. Quinn]] on June 8, 1959.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Pamphlet that accompanied ”The Official Statehood Medal Commemorating the Admission of Hawaii as the 50th State of the United States of America, August 21, 1959”, Medallic Art Company, New York&lt;/ref&gt; The passage of the [[Hawaii Admission Act|Admission Act]] in 1959, admitted Hawaii as the 50th State of the United States of America on August 21, 1959.

The seal of the [[Territory of Hawaii]] was the same as the seal of the republic, except that it had "Territory of Hawaii"  placed at the top and "1900" (signifying the year that the territorial government officially was organized) within the circle.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The 1901 Territorial Legislature authorized the modified republic seal as the Seal of the Territory of Hawaii.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The seal of the [[Republic of Hawaii]] had the words "Republic of Hawaii" at the top and "MDCCCXCIV" within the circle. The year 1894 signified the date that the republic was established.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The republic seal was designed by Viggo Jacobsen, a Honolulu resident, and itself was derived from the Kingdom of Hawaii coat of arms used during the reign of  [[Kamehameha III|King Kamehameha III]], [[Kalākaua|King Kalākaua]] and [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]], which had been designed by the [[College of Arms]] in London in 1842 and officially adopted in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Great State seals of the United States|last=Berg|first=Annemarie|page=41|year=1979|isbn=978-0-396-07705-3|publisher=[[Dodd, Mead and Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State Seal==
The '''Great Seal of the State of Hawaii''' is circular in shape, two and three-quarters inches in diameter, and of the design being described, with the tinctures added as the basis for the coat of arms. The Hawaii state seal represents Hawaii's nation.

==Arms design==
In the center of the seal is a heraldic shield which is quartered. The first and fourth quarters display the white, red, and blue stripes of ''Ka Hae Hawai{{okina}}i'' or the [[Flag of Hawaii|flag of Hawai{{okina}}i]]. The second and third quarters are on a yellow field with a white ''Pulo{{okina}}ulo{{okina}}u'', or [[kapu]] sticks with tapa-covered balls on the end. In the center of the heraldic shield is a green escutcheon with a five-pointed yellow star in the center.

==Supporters design==
On the left side is Kamehameha I, standing in the attitude as represented by the bronze statue in front of [[Ali'iolani Hale]], Honolulu. His cloak and helmet (a mahiole) are in yellow. Kamehameha I's figure is in [[Proper (heraldry)|proper]]. [[Kamehameha I]]  unified the [[Hawaiian Islands]] into a single united kingdom. On the right side is goddess Liberty also wearing a Phrygian cap and laurel wreath. She is holding ''Ka Hae Hawai{{okina}}i'' in her right hand that is partly unfurled.

==Crest design==
A rising sun irradiated in gold surrounded by the legend "State of Hawaii, 1959" on a scroll in black lettering.

==Motto design==
The [[state motto]]: ''[[Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono]]'' is on the scroll on the seal's bottom in gold lettering. ''Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono'' is roughly translated into [[English language|English]] as "The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness." The motto was adopted by the [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]] in 1843 and was used in an address by King [[Kamehameha III]] at ceremonies following the return of his kingdom from the British. British captain Lord George Paulet of {{HMS|Carysfort|1836|6}} demanded that [[Paulet Affair (1843)|Hawai{{okina}}i was ceded]] to [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] in response to claims of political abuses against British residents made by British Consul [[Richard Charlton (Hawaii)|Richard Charlton]]. After Kamehameha III notified [[London]] of the captain's actions, Admiral [[Richard Darton Thomas]] returned sovereignty back to the King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Thomas Square nomination form |author= Dorothy Riconda |work= National Register of Historic Places |date= March 23, 1972 |publisher= U.S. National Park Service |url= {{NRHP url|id=72000423}} |accessdate=2010-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The motto is also featured in [[Israel Kamakawiwo'ole]]'s song "Hawaii '78" and is used on the Hawaii [[state quarter]].

==[[Compartment (heraldry)|Compartment]] design==
Below the heraldic shield, the bird [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] has it wings outstretched arising from flames. The phoenix's body is black and wings half yellow and half dark red. Below the heraldic shield are eight [[taro|taro leaves]] having on either side [[banana|banana foliage]] and sprays of [[maidenhair fern]] trailed upwardly.

==Symbolism==
*1959 represents the year of admission into the Union as a state.
*The rising sun replaced the royal crown from the original coat of arms. This represents the birth of a new state.
*[[King Kamehameha the Great]] and the [[Liberty (goddess)|Goddess of Liberty]] holding the Hawaiian flag replace the two warriors on the royal coat of arms. This may represent the old government leader (King Kamehameha the Great) and the new government leader (The Goddess of Liberty).
*The quartered design of the heraldic shield is retained from the original coat of arms.
*The eight stripes in two of the quarters of the shield represent the eight main islands.
*The ''[[puloulou|Pulo{{okina}}ulo{{okina}}u]]'', or ''[[tabu ball]] and stick'', in the second and third quarters was carried before the king and placed before the door of his home, signifying his authority and power. In the seal it is a symbol of the authority and power of the government.
*The star in the middle of the shield signifies the fiftieth star added to the United States flag.
*The [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], symbol of death and resurrection, symbolizes the change from an [[absolute monarchy]] to a free, [[U.S. state|democratic form of government]].
*The eight [[taro|taro leaves]], flanked by [[banana|banana foliage]] and [[maidenhair fern]] are typical Hawaiian flora and represent the eight main islands. Taro is the traditional staff of life and has great spiritual significance. Taro is also still cultivated and is the ingredient of the popular dish called [[poi (food)|poi]].
*The state motto, "''[[Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono]]''", "The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness," is retained from the royal coat of arms.

A '''sequel'''  is a [[literature]], [[film]], [[theatre]], [[television]],  [[music]] or [[video game]] that continues the story of, or expands upon, some earlier work. In the common context of a [[narrative]] work of [[fiction]], a sequel portrays events set in the same [[fictional universe]] as an earlier work, usually [[chronological]]ly following the events of that work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Sequels of Hit Films Now Often Loser|work= The New York Times|date=March 12, 1991|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/12/movies/sequels-of-hit-films-now-often-loser.html?scp=9&amp;sq=robocop&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-09 | first=Geraldine | last=Fabrikant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, the sequel continues elements of the original story, often with the same characters and settings. A sequel can lead to a [[film series|series]], in which key elements appear repeatedly. Although the difference between more than one sequel and a series is somewhat arbitrary, it is clear that some [[media franchise]]s have enough sequels to become a series, whether originally planned as such or not.{{CN|date=October 2017}}

Sequels are attractive to creators and to publishers because there is less risk involved in returning to a story with known popularity rather than developing new and untested characters and settings. Audiences are sometimes eager for more stories about popular characters or settings, making the production of sequels financially appealing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Creative Bankruptcy|work= Call It Like I See It|date=June 15, 2011|url= http://www.callitlikeiseeit.com/?p=230 | first=David | last=Rosen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In movies, sequels are common. There are many name formats for sequels. Sometimes, they either have unrelated titles or have a letter added on the end. More commonly, they have numbers at the end or have an added word on the end.{{CN|date=October 2017}} It is also common for a sequel to have a variation of the original title or have a subtitle. In the 1930s, many musical sequels had the year included in the title. Sometimes sequels are released with different titles in different countries, because of the perceived brand recognition. There are several ways that subsequent works can be related to the [[chronology]] of the original. Various [[neologism]]s have been coined to describe them.

==Chronologies==
The most common approach is for the events of the second work to directly follow the events of the first, either picking up dangling plot threads or introducing a new conflict to drive the events of a second story. This is often called a '''direct sequel'''. A '''legacy sequel''' is a work which follows the continuity of the original work or works but takes place longer in the future, often focusing on new characters but with the original ones still present.&lt;ref&gt;https://filmschoolrejects.com/6-films-that-are-waiting-for-their-legacy-sequels-5851c0912005/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2016/12/do-legacy-sequels-fail-if-they-pander-to-the-fans/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/creed/251731/creed-2-loses-sylvester-stallone-as-director&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy sequels are sometimes also direct sequels which ignore previous sequels in the cronology, sometimes even [[retconning]] preceding sequels to the original work. An example of this is [[Halloween (2018 film)|''Halloween'' (2018)]] which is a direct sequel to [[Halloween (1978 film)|''Halloween'' (1978)]]. When a work is set in the same universe, yet has very little if any narrative connection to its predecessors and can be appreciated on its own without a thorough understanding of the backstory, then the work can be referred to as a '''standalone sequel'''. ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]'', ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]'', ''[[Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle]]'', ''[[Son of the Mask]]'', ''[[Cars 3]]'', and ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' are examples of stand-alone movie sequels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Andre-Driussi|title=Lexicon Urthus, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9neV_vyIX14C&amp;pg=PP21|accessdate=30 July 2013|date=1 August 2008|publisher=Sirius Fiction|isbn=978-0-9642795-1-3|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cinematicslant.com/2018/08/14/five-films-show-how-2008-redefined-the-movies/|title=Five Films Show How 2008 Redefined the Movies|date=14 August 2018|publisher=Cinematic Slant|accessdate=September 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sequel to the first sequel might be referred to as a "third installment" or '''threequel''' or second sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Kenneth Muir|title=Horror Films of the 1980s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VJ1vcmaOd7wC&amp;pg=PA43|accessdate=30 July 2013|year=2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5501-0|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Soanes, Stevenson | year = 2008 |title=[[Concise Oxford English dictionary]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 1501 | isbn= 0199548412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sequel that portrays events prior those of the original work is called a '''[[prequel]]'''.&lt;ref name=Silverblatt&gt;{{cite book|last=Silverblatt|first=Art|year=2007|title=Genre Studies in Mass Media: A Handbook|publisher=[[M. E. Sharpe]]|isbn=9780765616708|page=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=R7ixUTC8EpwC&amp;pg=PA211 211]|quote=Prequels focus on the action that took place ''before'' the original narrative. For instance, in ''Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith'' the audience learns about how Darth Vader originally became a villain. A prequel assumes that the audience is familiar with the original—the audience must rework the narrative so that they can understand how the prequel leads up to the beginning of the original.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallels or '''paraquels''' are stories that run at the same point in time within the universe of the story.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary {{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/parallel|title=parallel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"What is a Paraquel?", ''[[The Storyteller's Scroll]]''; Sunday, March 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark J.P. Wolf, ''Building Imaginary Worlds: The Theory and History of Subcreation''; 210&lt;/ref&gt; '''Midquels''' refers to works which take place between evens, there are different types of "midquels".&lt;ref&gt;Mark J.P. Wolf; ''The Routledge Companion to Imaginary Worlds''&lt;/ref&gt; Such as '''interquels''' which are stories that take place in between two preceding stories and serve as a sequel to one and a prequel to another simultaneously. For example, if Movie C is an interquel of movies A and B, the events of movie C take place after the events of movie A but before the events of movie B. ''[[Rogue One]]'' of the Star Wars series is an "interquel" since it takes place between ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope]]''. '''Intraquels''' on the other hand are works which focus on events between the events of the same film. ''[[Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas]]'' which taker place on the [[Christmas]] between the begining and the end of the film ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' is often called a "midquel" but is more exactly an "intraquel".&lt;ref&gt;William D. Crump, ''How the Movies Saved Christmas: 228 Rescues from Clausnappers, Sleigh Crashes, Lost Presents and Holiday Disasters''; 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes; ''The Enchanted Screen: The Unknown History of Fairy-Tale Films''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark J.P. Wolf; ''The Routledge Companion to Imaginary Worlds''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standalone sequels==
When a work is set in the same universe, yet has very little if any narrative connection to its predecessors and can be appreciated on its own without a thorough understanding of the backstory, then the work can be referred to as a '''standalone sequel'''. ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]'', ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]'', ''[[Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle]]'', ''[[Son of the Mask]]'', ''[[Cars 3]]'', and ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' are examples of stand-alone movie sequels.

==History==
In ''The Afterlife of a Character'', David Brewer describes a reader's desire to "see more", or to know what happens next in a narrative after it has ended.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David A. ''The Afterlife of Character, 1726-1825.'' Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This capacity for expansive curiosity is certainly not restricted to a particular era in human history. Indeed, we can point to Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'' as a sequel to the ''[[Iliad]]'' in the sense that it expands upon plot and character elements established in the first text. That both the ''Odyssey'' and the ''Iliad'' were written in the 8th century B.C.E. and are traditionally held to represent the first extant works of [[western literature]] lends credence to the ubiquity of sequels in literary history. The Judeo-Christian [[Bible]] is also a common referent in that sense; many of the works included in the Hebrew Scriptures can be classified as sequels in that they continue and expand on a very general narrative that is pre-established by previous books in the same collection. In addition, the development of an official [[Biblical canon|canon]] allows for the distinction between official and unofficial sequels; in this context, [[apocrypha]] might be considered an early form of informal sequel literature. 
Sequels, then, become an important facet of Western literature throughout history. The medieval genre of [[Romance (heroic literature)|Romance]], in particular, contains massive networks of prequel and sequel literature.

===Sequels of the novel===
The origin of the sequel as we think of it in the 21st century developed from the [[novella]] and [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] traditions in a slow process that culminated towards the end of the 17th century.

The substantial shift towards a rapidly growing [[print culture]] and the rise of the market system by the early 18th-century meant that an author's merit and livelihood became increasingly linked to the number of copies of a work he or she could sell. This shift from a text-based to an author-centered reading culture&lt;ref&gt;

led to the "professionalization" of the author — that is, the development of a "sense of identity based on a marketable skill and on supplying to a defined public a specialized service it was demanding".&lt;ref&gt;To Renew Their Former Acquaintance': Print, Gender, and Some Eighteenth-Century Sequels by Betty A. Schellenberg from Part Two: Reflections on the Sequel&lt;/ref&gt; In one sense, then, sequels became a means to profit further from previous work that had already obtained some measure of commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;Budra, Paul, and Betty Schellenberg. "Introduction." Part Two Reflections on the Sequel (Theory / Culture). New York: University of Toronto, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As the establishment of a readership became increasingly important to the economic viability of authorship, sequels offered a means to establish a recurring economic outlet.

In addition to serving economic profit, the sequel was also used as a method to strengthen an author's claim to his literary property. With weak copyright laws and unscrupulous booksellers willing to sell whatever they could, in some cases the only way to prove ownership of a text was to produce another like it. Sequels in this sense are rather limited in scope, as the authors are focused on producing "more of the same" to defend their "literary paternity".&lt;ref name="Schellenberg, Betty A 1998"&gt;Schellenberg, Betty A. "To Renew Their Former Acquaintance': Print, Gender, and Some Eighteenth-Century Sequels." Part Two Reflections on the Sequel (Theory / Culture). Ed. Paul Budra and Betty A. Schellenberg. New York: University of Toronto, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As is true throughout history, sequels to novels provided an opportunity for authors to interact with a readership. This became especially important in the economy of the 18th century novel, in which authors often maintained readership by drawing readers back with the promise of more of what they liked from the original. With sequels, therefore, came the implicit division of readers by authors into the categories of "desirable" and "undesirable"—that is, those that interpret the text in a way unsanctioned by the author. Only after having achieved a significant reader base would an author feel free to alienate or ignore the "undesirable" readers.&lt;ref name="Schellenberg, Betty A 1998"/&gt;

This concept of "undesirable" readers extends to unofficial sequels with the 18th century novel. While in certain historical contexts unofficial sequels were actually the norm (for an example, see [[Arthurian literature]]), with the emphasis on the author function that arises in conjunction with the novel many authors began to see these kinds of unauthorized extensions as being in direct conflict with authorial authority. In the matter of ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (an early novel, perhaps better classified as a satirical romance), for example, [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]] disapproved of [[Alonso Fernández de Avellaneda]]'s use of his characters in ''Second Volume of the Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha'', an unauthorized sequel. In response, Cervantes very firmly kills the protagonist at the end of the Second Part to discourage any more such creative liberties.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, E.C. "Three Versions of Don Quixote". ''The Modern Language Review'' 68.4 (173). JSTOR. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is [[Samuel Richardson]], an 18th-century author who responded particularly strongly against the appropriation of his material by unauthorized third parties. Richardson was extremely vocal in his disapproval of the way the protagonist of his novel ''[[Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]'' was repeatedly incorporated into unauthorized sequels featuring particularly lewd plots. The most famous of these is [[Henry Fielding]]'s parody, entitled ''[[Shamela]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David A. The Afterlife of Character, 1726-1825. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''To Renew Their Former Acquaintance: Print, Gender, and Some Eighteenth Century Sequels'', Betty Schellenberg theorizes that whereas for male writers in the 18th century sequels often served as "models of paternity and property", for women writers these models were more likely to be seen as transgressive. Instead, the recurring readership created by sequels let female writers function within the model of "familiar acquaintances reunited to enjoy the mutual pleasures of conversation", and made their writing an "activity within a private, non-economic sphere." Ironically, through this created perception women writers were able to break into the economic sphere and "enhance their professional status" through authorship.&lt;ref name="Schellenberg, Betty A 1998"/&gt;

Dissociated from the motives of profit and therefore unrestrained by the need for continuity felt by male writers, Schellenberg argues that female-authored sequel fiction tended to have a much broader scope.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} He says that women writers showed an "innovative freedom" that male writers rejected to "protect their patrimony." For example, [[Sarah Fielding]]'s ''Adventures of David Simple'' and its sequels ''Familiar Letters between the Principal Characters in David Simple'' and ''David Simple, Volume the Last'' are extremely innovative and cover almost the entire range of popular narrative styles of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Michie, Allen.

==Media franchises==
{{Main|Media franchise}}
In some cases, the characters or setting of an original film or video game become so valuable that they develop into a [[media franchise]]. Generally, a whole series of sequels is made, along with [[merchandising]]. Multiple sequels are often planned well in advance and actors and directors may sign extended contracts to ensure their participation. This can extend into a franchise's initial production's plot to provide story material to develop for sequels called sequel hooks. 

===Box office===
Movie sequels do not always do as well at the box office as the original, but they tend to do better than non-sequels, according to a study in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Business Research. The shorter the period between releases, the better the sequel does at the box office. Sequels also show a faster drop in weekly revenues relative to non-sequels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/541522/ Newswise: Researchers Investigate Box Office Impact Vs. Original Movie] Retrieved on June 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media shifting===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Sequels are most often produced in the same medium as the previous work (e.g. a film sequel is usually a sequel to another film). Producing sequels to a work in another medium has recently become common, especially when the new medium is less costly or time-consuming to produce.

A sequel to a popular but discontinued television series may be produced in another medium, thereby bypassing whatever factors led to the series cancellation. 

Some highly popular movies and television series have inspired the production of multiple novel sequels, sometimes rivaling or even dwarfing the volume of works in the original medium.

For example, the 1956 novel ''[[The Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'', its [[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|1961 animated adaptation]] and that film's [[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|1996 live-action remake]] each have a sequel unrelated to the other sequels: respectively ''[[The Starlight Barking]]'' (1967), ''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure]]'' (2003, direct to video) and ''[[102 Dalmatians]]'' (2000).

==Unofficial sequels==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
Sometimes sequels are produced without the consent of the creator of the original work. These may be dubbed unofficial, informal, unauthorized, or illegitimate sequels. In some cases, the work is in the [[public domain]], and there is no legal obstacle to producing sequels. An example would be a book or movie that served as a sequel to the original book ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]],'' which is in the public domain (as opposed to the 1939 movie). In other cases, the original creator or their heirs may assert [[copyright]]s and challenge the creators of the sequels. 

Another example of an unofficial sequel would be ''[[Never Say Never Again]],'' a James Bond movie starring Sean Connery that was not produced by [[Eon Productions]], which has handled nearly all of the other Bond films.

[[File:Painting Thangka Lhasa Tibet Luca Galuzzi 2006.jpg|thumb|Painting Thangka in Lhasa, Tibet]]
A '''thangka''', variously spelt as '''thangka''', '''tangka''', '''thanka''', or '''tanka''' ({{IPA-ne|ˈथान्का|Nepali pronunciation:}}; {{bo|t=ཐང་ཀ་}}; [[Nepal Bhasa]]: पौभा), is a [[Tibetan Buddhist]] painting on [[cotton]], [[silk]] [[appliqué]], usually depicting a [[Buddhist]] deity, scene, or [[mandala]]. Thangkas are traditionally kept unframed and rolled up when not on display, mounted on a textile backing somewhat in the style of Chinese scroll paintings, with a further silk cover on the front. So treated, thangkas can last a long time, but because of their delicate nature, they have to be kept in dry places where moisture will not affect the quality of the silk. Most thangkas are relatively small, comparable in size to a Western half-length portrait, but some are extremely large, several metres in each dimension; these were designed to be displayed, typically for very brief periods on a monastery wall, as part of religious festivals. Most thangkas were intended for personal meditation or instruction of monastic students. They often have elaborate compositions including many very small figures.  A central deity is often surrounded by other identified figures in a symmetrical composition.  Narrative scenes are less common, but do appear.

Thangka serve as important teaching tools depicting the life of the Buddha, various influential lamas and other deities and [[bodhisattva]]s. One subject is The [[Wheel of Life]] (''Bhavachakra''), which is a visual representation of the [[Abhidharma]] teachings (Art of Enlightenment).  The term may sometimes be used of works in other media than painting, including [[relief]]s in metal and [[woodblock prints]].  Today printed reproductions at poster size of painted thangka are commonly used for devotional as well as decorative purposes. Many tangkas were produced in sets, though they have often subsequently become separated.

Thangka perform several different functions. Images of deities can be used as teaching tools when depicting the life (or lives) of the Buddha, describing historical events concerning important Lamas, or retelling myths associated with other deities. Devotional images act as the centerpiece during a ritual or ceremony and are often used as mediums through which one can offer prayers or make requests. Overall, and perhaps most importantly, religious art is used as a meditation tool to help bring one further down the path to enlightenment. The Buddhist [[Vajrayana]] practitioner uses a thanga image of their [[yidam]], or meditation deity, as a guide, by visualizing "themselves as being that deity, thereby internalizing the Buddha qualities"&lt;ref&gt;Lipton, Ragnubs&lt;/ref&gt;  tangkas hang on or beside altars, and may be hung in the bedrooms or offices of monks and other devotees.

==History==
Tibetan Buddhist painting developed from widespread traditions of early Buddhist paintings which now only survive in a few sites such as the [[Ajanta Caves]] in India and the [[Mogao Caves]] on the [[Silk Road]], which has very extensive wall-paintings and was the repository for what are now the earliest surviving Tibetan paintings on cloth.  The thanka form developed alongside the tradition of [[Tibetan Buddhist wall paintings]], which are or were mostly in monasteries.

The early history of the form is more easily traced through these murals, which survive in greater numbers than the portable paintings which certainly once existed.&lt;ref&gt;Kossak and Singer, 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;  Most thanka were commissioned by individuals, who were believed to acquire merit by doing so.  They might then be given to a monastery or another individual, or retained for use by the commissioner.  Some thangka have inscriptions on their back recording that they were the personal meditation image (''thugs dam'') of a notable monk.&lt;ref&gt;For example Kossak and Singer, #20&lt;/ref&gt;  Most artists were probably monks, although lay artists seem to have existed, as they did for metalwork sculpture.  The commissioner would provide the materials, which were often valuable, and by tradition the compensation to the artist was regarded as a "gift" rather than a fee.&lt;ref&gt;Rhie, in Rhie and Thurman, 41-42&lt;/ref&gt;  The word "thangka" means "thing that one unrolls" in [[Classical Tibetan]].&lt;ref&gt;Béguin, Gilles, in Rhie and Thurman, 386&lt;/ref&gt;  Thangka are very rarely signed, but some artists are known, more because they were important monastic leaders than famous as artists. Painting was a valued accomplishment in a monk.&lt;ref&gt;Kossak and Singer, 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest survivals of Tibetan paintings on cloth are in some pieces from the Mogao Caves at [[Dunhuang]] on the Silk Road, in [[Gansu]] province, China. The "Library Cave" there was a repository of old or worn out manuscripts, paintings, prints, textiles and other items which was sealed off in the 11th century, after several centuries of deposits. Many of the paintings have Tibetan inscriptions or are in a style that can be recognized as Tibetan, as opposed to the dominant Chinese style and some pieces reflecting Indian styles.&lt;ref&gt;Béguin, Gilles, in Rhie and Thurman, 385; Rhie, in Rhie and Thurman, 41–42, 122&lt;/ref&gt;  Though they are hard to date, it is thought that these pieces mainly come from a period c. 781–848 when the area was ruled by Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;Rhie and Thurman, 122; Kossak and Singer, 3–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving tangkas on cloth certainly from Tibet itself start in the 11th century, after the revival of Buddhism; there are some 20 surviving from this and the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kossak and Singer, 15&lt;/ref&gt;  Such early examples typically have compositions that are already complex, but less so than in later examples. As later the typical compositions shows a central figure flanked by smaller other figures, often in framed compartments, or surrounded by flaming halos or seated on small clouds. Behind these figures a landscape background including much sky is often indicated, though little of it may be visible.  The central figure may be a deity, and [[arhat]], or an important monk, and the same groups make up the background figures. Several of the figures may be different "aspects" or reincarnations of each other according to Buddhist theology. In the example at left the flanking [[bodhisattva]]s are in a style, one of several found in such figures in this period, that appears derived from central Indian art.&lt;ref&gt;Rhie and Thurman, 47-49&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the following centuries Tibetan painting, both on walls and thangka, continued to develop in its distinctive style, balancing between the two major influences of Indo-Nepalese and [[Chinese painting]], despite Buddhism being in general decline in both those regions.  Styles could vary considerably between the different regions of Tibet as well as the wider region where tangkas were painted.  Within Tibet the regions nearer Nepal and China were often more influenced by those styles. [[Bhutanese art|Bhutanese tangkas]] were mainly influenced by Central Tibet. The different [[Tibetan Buddhism#Schools|monastic orders]] also developed somewhat different stylistic characters.

Tibetan painting incorporated many elements from Chinese painting, especially from the 14th century onwards, reaching a peak in the 18th century.  One aspect of this was allowing more space and emphasis to the landscape background.  In general the style of figures in thangka remains derived from the Indo-Nepalese tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Rhie and Thurman, 52-65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McKay&gt;McKay, Alex. ''The History of Tibet''. Routledge. 2003. p. 596-597. {{ISBN|0-7007-1508-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Giuseppe Tucci]], by the time of the [[Qing Dynasty]], "a new Tibetan art was then developed, which in a certain sense was a provincial echo of the Chinese 18th century's smooth ornate preciosity."&lt;ref name=McKay/&gt;  Throughout the period the Chinese Imperial court retained diplomatic and other contacts with Tibet for political reasons, but when the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] [[Qing dynasty]] came to power court interest in Tibetan Buddhism increased, and many Chinese works in a very refined and elegant style, though eventually becoming rather stiff, were produced by Imperial artists and often sent to Tibet as gifts, influencing local styles.  As well as the court style, there was influence from the regions of China near to Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;Rhie and Thurman,64-65&lt;/ref&gt;

Tangkas were painted in all the areas where Tibetan Buddhism flourished, which apart from those mentioned already included [[Mongolia]], [[Ladakh]], [[Sikkim]], and parts of [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] India in [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Dharamshala]], and [[Lahaul and Spiti district]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]]. It is also practiced in parts of [[Russia]] ([[Kalmykia]], [[Buryatia]], and [[Tuva]]) and [[Northeast China]].

Other traditions of Buddhist scroll paintings are not usually covered by the term thangka, although they may have many similarities, and descend from the same origins.  An example is [[Japanese painting]], where a number of very early examples survive from the [[Nara period|Nara]] (710-794) and [[Heian period]]s (794 to 1185).  Most of these are [[List of National Treasures of Japan (paintings)|National Treasures of Japan]]. ''[[Raigō|Raigō-zu]]'' developed as one popular genre, showing the [[Amitābha|Amida]] Buddha accompanied by bodhisattvas welcoming the souls of the faithful to his [[Western Paradise]].  These were, and still are, carried into the house of a person who was near death.

==Types==
Based on technique and material, tangkas can be grouped by types. Generally, they are divided into two broad categories: those that are painted (Tib.) bris-tan&amp;mdash;and those made of silk, either by appliqué or embroidery.

Tangkas are further divided into these more specific categories:

* Painted in colours (Tib.) tson-tang—the most common type
* [[Appliqué]] (Tib.) go-tang
* Black Background—meaning gold line on a black background (Tib.) nagtang
* Blockprints—paper or cloth outlined renderings, by [[woodcut]]/[[woodblock printing]]
* Embroidery (Tib.) tsem-thang
* Gold Background—an auspicious treatment, used judiciously for peaceful, long-life deities and fully enlightened buddhas
* Red Background—literally gold line, but referring to gold line on a vermillion (Tib.) mar-tang

Whereas typical tangkas are fairly small, with painted area between about 20 to 50&amp;nbsp;centimetres high, there are also giant festival tangkas, usually appliqué, and designed to be unrolled against a wall in a monastery for particular religious occasions.  These are likely to be wider than they are tall, and may be sixty or more feet across and perhaps twenty or more high. In Bhutan at least these are called [[thongdrel]]s.  There are also larger than average thankas that were designed for altars or display in temples.

Somewhat related are [[Tibetan tsakli]], cards which look like miniature tangkas perhaps up to 15&amp;nbsp;centimetres high, and often square, usually containing a single figure.  These were mostly produced in sets and were usually used in earlier stages of training monks, or as initiation cards or offerings, or to use when constructing temporary mandalas.  Another related form is the painted wooden top cover for a manuscript book, giving a long narrow strip, typically some 6&amp;nbsp;cm by 55&amp;nbsp;cm, often painted with a row of seated figures in compartments. The techniques for both these forms are essentially the same as for thangka, and presumably the same artists worked on them. Because tangkas can be quite expensive, people nowadays use posters of tangkas as an alternative to the real tangkas for religious purposes.

Sources on Asian art often describe all-textile tangkas as "tapestry", but tangkas that meet the normal definition of tapestry with the image created only by [[weaving]] a single piece of fabric with different colours of thread are extremely rare, though a few tapestry examples in the Chinese ''[[K'o-ssu|kesi]]'' technique are known, mostly from the medieval period. There is a large example in the [[Hermitage Museum]], although in this and other pieces the different colours are woven separately and then sewn together in a type of [[patchwork]].&lt;ref&gt;Rhie and Thurman, 126-127&lt;/ref&gt;  Most thangka described as tapestry are some combination of [[embroidery]], [[appliqué]] and other techniques.

==Process==

Tangkas are painted on [[cotton duck|cotton]] or silk. The most common is a loosely woven cotton produced in widths from 40 to 58&amp;nbsp;cm (16 - 23&amp;nbsp;inches). While some variations do exist, tangkas wider than 45&amp;nbsp;cm (17 or 18&amp;nbsp;inches) frequently have seams in the support. The paint consists of [[pigment]]s in a water-soluble [[Media (arts)|medium]] of animal [[glue]]. Both mineral and organic pigments are used. In Western terminology, this is a [[distemper (paint)|distemper]] technique; although it is often described as a form of [[gouache]], this is incorrect, and the paint was applied as a warm liquid, mixed shortly before application.&lt;ref&gt;Kossak and Singer, 196-199&lt;/ref&gt;

Most old thangka have inscriptions on the back, usually the [[mantra]] of the deity depicted, but sometimes also information as to later owners, though rarely information about the original commissioner or artist. Sometimes x-rays allow pious inscriptions placed under the paint on the front of the image to be seen. Inscriptions may be made in the shape of a [[stupa]], or sometimes other shapes.&lt;ref&gt;Kossak and Singer, 205&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of a thangka, as with the majority of [[Buddhist art]], is highly geometric. Arms, legs, eyes, nostrils, ears, and various ritual implements are all laid out on a systematic grid of angles and intersecting lines. A skilled thangka artist will generally select from a variety of predesigned items to include in the composition, ranging from alms bowls and animals, to the shape, size, and angle of a figure's eyes, nose, and lips. The process seems very methodical, but often requires deep understanding of the symbolism involved to capture the spirit of it.

Thangka often overflow with symbolism and allusion. Because the art is explicitly religious, all symbols and allusions must be in accordance with strict guidelines laid out in Buddhist scripture. The artist must be properly trained and have sufficient religious understanding, knowledge, and background to create an accurate and appropriate thangka:

"[[Tibetan art]] exemplifies the [[nirmanakaya]], the physical body of Buddha, and also the qualities of the Buddha, perhaps in the form of a deity. Art objects, therefore, must follow rules specified in the Buddhist scriptures regarding proportions, shape, color, stance, hand positions, and attributes in order to personify correctly the Buddha or Deities."&lt;ref&gt;Lipton and Ragnubs, ''Treasures of Tibetan Art''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nepal==
The earliest surviving thangka paintings from Nepal date to about the 14th century AD, but this is probably well after Buddhists and Hindus began to make illustrations of the deities and natural scenes. Historically, Tibetan and Chinese influence in Nepalese paintings is quite evident in [[Paubha]]s (Tangkas), and Nepalese styles have been a significant influence on Tibetan art. Paubhas are of two types, the Palas which are illustrative paintings of the deities and the Mandala, which are mystic diagrams paintings of complex test prescribed patterns of circles and square each having specific significance.  It was through Nepal that [[Mahayana Buddhism]] was introduced into Tibet during reign of Angshuvarma in the seventh century AD. There was therefore a great demand for religious icons and Buddhist manuscripts for newly built monasteries throughout Tibet. A number of Buddhist manuscripts, including Prajnaparamita, were copied in [[Kathmandu Valley]] for these monasteries. Astasahas rika Prajnaparamita for example, was copied in Patan in the year 999 AD., during the reign of Narendra Dev and Udaya Deva, for the Sa-Shakya monastery in Tibet. For the Nor monastery in Tibet, two copies were made in Nepal, one of Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita in 1069 AD and the other of Kavyadarsha in 1111 AD. The influence of Nepalese art extended to China in regular order in the thirteenth century. Nepalese artisans were dispatched to the courts of Chinese emperors at their request to perform their workmanship and impart expert knowledge, with the Nepalese innovator and architect Balbahu, known by his popular name [[Araniko]] becoming the chief Imperial artist of [[Kubilai Khan]].

After the introduction of paper, palm leaf became less popular, however, it continued to be used until the eighteenth century. Paper manuscripts imitated the oblong shape but were wider than the palm leaves.  From the fifteenth century onwards, brighter colours gradually began to appear in Nepalese thangka. Because of the growing importance of the [[Tantra|tantric]] cult, various aspects of [[Shiva]] and [[Shakti]] were painted in conventional poses. [[Mahakala]], [[Manjushri]], [[Lokeshwara]] and other deities were equally popular and so were also frequently represented in thangka paintings of later dates. As Tantrism embodies the ideas of esoteric power, magic forces, and a great variety of symbols, strong emphasis is laid on the female element and sexuality in the paintings of that period.

Religious paintings worshipped as icons are known as Paubha in Newari and thangka in Tibetan. The origin of Paubha or thangka paintings may be attributed to the Nepalese artists responsible for creating a number of special metal works and wall- paintings as well as illuminated manuscripts in Tibet. Realizing the great demand for religious icons in Tibet, these artists, along with monks and traders, took with them from Nepal not only metal sculptures but also a number of Buddhist manuscripts. One of the earliest specimens of Nepalese Thangka painting dates from the thirteenth /fourteenth century and shows [[Amitabha]] surrounded by bodhisattva. Another Nepalese thangka with three dates in the inscription (the last one corresponding to 1369 A.D.), is one of the earliest known thangka with inscriptions. The "Mandala of Vishnu " dated 1420 A.D., is another fine example of the painting of this period. Early Nepalese Tangkas are simple in design and composition. The main deity, a large figure, occupies the central position while surrounded by smaller figures of lesser divinities.

During the reign of Tibetan Dharma King Trisong Duetsen the Tibetan masters refined their already well-developed arts through research and studies of different country's tradition. Thanka painting's lining and measurement, costumes, implementations and ornaments are mostly based on Indian styles. The drawing of figures is based on Nepalese style and the background sceneries are based on Chinese style. Thus, the thangka paintings became a unique and distinctive art. Although the practice of thanka painting was originally done as a way of gaining merit it has nowadays evolved into a commercial business and the noble intentions it once carried has been diluted. Tibetans do not sell Tangkas on a large scale as the selling of religious artifacts such as tangkas and idols is frowned upon in the Tibetan community and thus non Tibetan groups have been able to monopolize on its (thangka's) popularity among Buddhist and art enthusiasts from the west.

Thangka have developed in the northern Himalayan regions among the Lamas. Besides Lamas, [[Gurung]] and [[Tamang]] communities are also producing Tankas, which provide substantial employment opportunities for many people in the hills. Newari Thankas or paubha have been produced in Kathmandu valley from the 13th century.

[[File:Thomas Luny, by Thomas Luny.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Self portrait]]

'''Thomas Luny''' (1759–1837), born in [[Cornwall]], probably at [[St Ewe]], was an English artist and painter, mostly of [[seascape]]s and other marine-based works.
At the age of eleven, Luny left Cornwall to live in [[London]]. There he became the apprentice of [[Francis Holman]], a marine painter who would have a great and long lasting artistic influence on Luny: Luny remained until 1780 in Holman's London studio, which, was first situated in Broad Street, St. George’s, and later relocated to Old Gravel Lane.
[[File:HMS Bellerophon Lying at Anchor by Thomas Luny.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|H.M.S. ''Bellerophon'']] Lying at Anchor by Thomas Luny (1827)]]
In September 1777, Luny left Holman's studio for a while, to journey to [[France]]. During this particular expedition, Luny almost certainly strayed from France itself; his first exhibited picture in London, seen at the [[Society of Artists of Great Britain|Society of Artists]] that same year, was given the title ''A distant view of the island of Madeira and Porto Santo'', suggesting that an engraving had inspired his choice of subject. Similarly, it is unlikely that Luny was on hand for the Battle of the Nile, 1798, and the bombardment of Algiers, 1816, both of which he illustrated with dramatic atmosphere and credible realism.
[[File:Sm Bombardment of Algiers, August 1816-Luny.jpg|left|thumb|250px|''[[Bombardment of Algiers (painting)|Bombardment of Algiers]]'' by Luny.]]
After leaving Holman's studio in 1780, Luny moved to [[Leadenhall Street]] during 1783. It was around this time that Luny was frequently exhibiting  at the [[Royal Academy]], in a total of twenty-nine exhibitions between 1780 and 1802. In Leadenhall Street, Luny became acquainted with a "Mr. Merle",  a dealer and framer of paintings who promoted Luny's paintings for over twenty years, to great success. Luny also found a wealthy source of business in Leadenhall Street, where the [[British East India Company]] had their headquarters; their officers commissioned many paintings and portraits from Luny. This relationship between the Company and Luny also had several non-monetary benefits for Luny; it seems probable that, considering the great detail and realistic look of many of his sketches of locations such as [[Naples]], [[Gibraltar]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina]], Luny was occasionally invited as a guest on the Company's ships on special occasions and voyages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/Artists/ArtistHomePage.aspx?artist_id=10847&amp;page_tab=Bio_and_links Thomas Luny (British, 1759-1837)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several years later, in 1807, Luny decided to move again, this time to [[Teignmouth]] in [[Devon]]. There he received a number of commissions (mostly from ex-[[mariner]]s, local [[gentry]] and the like), and he continued to be as successful in his work as he had been in London. Luny was by that time suffering with [[arthritis]] in both of his hands. This had no obvious impact on the quality or pace of his artistic work. In fact, of his lifetime oeuvre of over 3,000 works, over 2,200 were produced between 1807 and his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rehsgalleries.com/thomas_luny_battle_of_cape_st_vincent.html Visual History-Thomas Luny]&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 30 September 1837.

Thomas Luny was buried in the graveyard of St James' Church, the parish church of Teignmouth, alongside his half-brother Captain James Wallace, who had fought at the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)]] under Nelson's command.&lt;ref&gt;stjames-teignmouth.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

Specimens of his work are exhibited at the [[National Maritime Museum]] at [[Greenwich]], in the [[Royal Albert Memorial Museum]] in [[Exeter]], and at The [[Mariners' Museum]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]].

'''Anthony James Heaton [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]''' (born 11 October 1954) is a British sculptor, [[disability rights]] activist and arts administrator, who was awarded an OBE in 2013 for services to the arts and the [[disability arts]] movement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was CEO of the arts charity [[Shape Arts|Shape]] until March 2017. In 2012, he won the competition to produce an installation celebrating [[Channel 4]]'s involvement in the [[London 2012 Paralympic Games]].  This produced his 'Monument for the Unintended Performer'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Early years==

Heaton was born in [[Preston, Lancashire]], in 1954, the son of a [[coppersmith]].  When, at the age of 16, a motor bike accident left him with a [[spinal injury]], he switched from a [[comprehensive school]] to a local arts college at [[Southport]].  From 1972, he was self-employed as artist, sign writer, disc jockey, record shop proprietor, progressive rock band member and mural painter. According to a Disability Arts Online profile, at this period "Heaton gathered enormous expertise and self-reliance whilst appearing to drift aimlessly".&lt;ref name=square&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/tony_heaton_profile |title=Tony Heaton: Squaring The Circle |publisher=disability arts online |date=2007-05-08 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 he enrolled on a visual arts degree at [[Lancaster University]] whilst earning a living as a sign-painter.&lt;ref name=square/&gt;

A contemporary of [[Andy Goldsworthy]], Heaton experimented with environmental sculpture on sands at [[Morecambe Bay]]. Lancaster's head of sculpture, Paul Hatton, noted that the marks left by Heaton were immediately distinguishable from the footprints of his fellow students and urged him to develop work about this. Heaton states that, "A chance comment about how the marks left in the sand by my feet and crutches made my tracks immediately identifiable became the catalyst for a whole series of works relating to disability and my interaction with the environment".&lt;ref name="square" /&gt; Heaton exhibited a plaster cast of his feet and stick imprints, his first piece of disability art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonyheaton.co.uk/squareinthecircle.htm |title=Squareinthecircle? |publisher=tonyheaton.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic career ==

Heaton’s early sculptures often use what Disability Arts in London magazine described as "the everyday impedimenta of disability: [[Street fundraising|collecting can]]s, [[wheelchair|NHS wheelchairs]], [[X-ray]]s, [[Building regulations in the United Kingdom#Part M. Access to and use of Buildings|Part M of the Building Regulations]]".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; But his work contradicts the normal associations of such materials by turning them into "profound and joyously witty statements about the nature of our oppression".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Tony Heaton...exposed - a retrospective |journal=Disability Arts in London |volume=Issue 107 |date=November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early piece, "Springback" (1990), is an assemblage including a spinal X-Ray juxtaposed above the [[Shock absorber|shock absorber spring]]s of a scrapped motorcycle, referring to the accident which caused his impairment and the metal strengthening spring placed inside his spine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/tony-heaton-interview |title=Interview: John O'Donoghue talks to Tony Heaton, Shape CEO |publisher=disability arts online |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Shaken..not Stirred' (1991) consisted of a seven-feet high pyramid of 1,760 [[Street fundraising|charity collecting cans]], its ascending ranks of red plastic referring to the hierarchical nature of the charity system.  The whole edifice was brought crashing to the ground when Heaton threw an artificial leg at it, suggesting that the hierarchical system could be destroyed by the collective power of disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sutherland, A. |chapter=Choices, Rights and Cabaret |editor1=Swain, J. |editor2=French S. |title=Disability on Equal Terms |publisher=Sage |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4129-1987-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his work has developed, it has embodied ideas about disability and impairment.  For instance, "Split" (1995) is a [[woodcarving]] made from a piece of ash discarded by a wood turner as useless because it has a [[Shakes (timber)|shake]]; a fault running through it.  Heaton saw this as "indicative of a society that sees only perfection and disregards all that is damaged or perceived as impaired".&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

[[File:Wheelchair sculpture 6493.JPG|thumb|Great Britain from a Wheelchair]]
The 1994 sculpture, ‘Great Britain from a Wheelchair’ is a map of Britain made from two grey NHS wheelchairs.  "A delightful game, it forms a wonderful repudiation of the value judgement ('This is for some tragic bastard', in Heaton’s words) implicit in the wheelchairs."&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; An image of this work was chosen by the National Disability Arts Collection and Archive as an example of work from the ‘golden age’ of disability arts.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/disability-35063050 |title=The 'golden age' of disability arts - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2015-12-15 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2012 Paralympics  Heaton was invited to redesign 'Great Britain From a Wheelchair' as lecterns for [[Lord Coe]] and [[Philip Craven|Sir Phillip Craven]] during the opening and closing ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsinternational.org/artists/profiles/tony-heaton/ |title=Tony Heaton |publisher=Disability Arts International |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, he was commissioned to produce ‘Monument to the Unintended Performer’, an installation for the [[Big 4 (sculpture)|Big 4]]  sculpture sited outside Channel Four’s offices.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/channel-4-unveils-new-big-4-installation |title=Channel 4 unveils new 'Big 4' installation |publisher=Channel 4 |date=2012-05-28 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It brought together three elements in addition to the Big 4: the first based on the classical Greek sculpture [[Discobolus]], the discus thrower, evoking the spirit of the Olympics; the second element, a circle, representing the wheel of the international symbol of access; and lastly, the introduction of gold, silver and bronze considers hierarchy. Heaton stated: "I wanted to use the structure of the Big 4 as one of four elements that would fuse together to form a new cohesive piece - which would provoke thought and celebrate Channel 4's involvement and commitment to the Paralympics. The subtext is the assertion that disabled people are almost always the object of scrutiny and curiosity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/steps/features/clare-amsel-produces-the-paralympics/tony-heaton/ |title=Tony Heaton &amp;#124; Lancaster University |publisher=Lancaster.ac.uk |date=2014-01-31 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2012/07/public-art-and-disability |title=Public art and disability: Getting noticed |publisher=The Economist |date=2012-07-19 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Gold Lamé', included in the 2014 exhibition Art of The Lived Experiment, is an [[Cars for wheelchair users|invalid car]] covered in [[gold leaf]].  The title puns on the word "lame". Heaton states that the [[Invacar]] has been “transformed from prosthetic to sculpture, transmuted from spazz blue to gold, from Lame to Lamé”, mirroring his own life adjustments, where he says, "I transmuted from biker to invalid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedoublenegative.co.uk/2014/11/i-always-avoided-referring-to-disability-in-my-work-because-i-was-afraid-to-seem-pitiful-the-transformation-of-dadafest/ |title="I Always Avoided Referring To Disability In My Work, Because I Was Afraid To Seem Pitiful": The Transformation Of DaDaFest |publisher=The Double Negative |date=2014-11-04 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/dadafest-2014-art-of-the-lived-experiment-review |title=Review: DaDaFest International 2014: Art of the Lived Experiment |publisher=disability arts online |date=2014-11-14 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Holton Lee ==

From 1997 to 2007, Heaton was based in [[Dorset]], as Director of the [[Holton Lee Trust]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/movers-tony-heaton-chief-executive-shape/management/article/800469 |title=Movers: Tony Heaton, chief executive, Shape |publisher=Third Sector |date=2008-04-09 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; which offers a mix of environmental, artistic and spiritual activities, with short stay residential facilities for Disabled people, in an [[SSSI]] comprising 350 acres of woodland, reed bed and heath land landscape adjacent to [[Poole Harbour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countrysidemobility.org/locations/holton-lee |title=Holton Lee |publisher=Countryside Mobility |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heaton developed a 10-year strategic plan for the organisation: a contemporary arts and education programme based on a series of accessible buildings including a gallery and artists’ studios, which would enable a new programme of artistic work, a growth in residential capacity and a focus for disability arts. All the buildings would use local materials blending in with Holton Lee's natural surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/NDACA |title=National Disability Arts Collection and Archive |publisher=disability arts online |date=2007-05-08 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these, Faith House gallery, designed by [[Tony Fretton]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;was hailed by Jonathan Glancey in the Guardian as ‘one of the most beautiful new buildings in Britain’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jonathan Glancey |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2002/oct/07/architecture.artsfeatures |title=Tony Fretton's Faith House &amp;#124; Art and design |publisher=The Guardian |date=2002-10-07 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Heaton organised the DA21 Disability Arts Conference at Holton Lee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/2000_2003 |title=2000 - 2003 |publisher=disability arts online |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also planned the inaugural conference to discuss the establishment of what would become the [[National Disability Arts Collection and Archive]]. The idea then envisaged was to create a purpose-built archive as part of the developing Holton Lee campus. This was abandoned after Heaton moved on. NDACA will now take the form of an interactive website and catalogue, after receiving funding of nearly £1 million from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndaca.org.uk/about-ndaca |title=about ndaca - National Disability Arts Collection &amp; Archive |publisher=Ndaca.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shape ==

In 2007 Heaton became CEO of [[Shape Arts]], the arts and disability charity founded by dancer Gina Levete. He brought to the organisation a new emphasis on disability arts and professional opportunities for artists.

He instituted the Adam Reynolds Memorial Bursary, which provides 3-month bursaries for disabled artists to undertake residencies at leading visual arts institutions.  These have included the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[Camden Arts Centre]], [[Spike Island Artspace|Spike Island]], [[Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art|The Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art]], the Bluecoat Gallery and [[The New Art Gallery Walsall|New Art Gallery Walsall]]. The bursary is named after the late sculptor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shapearts.org.uk/Pages/News/Category/adam-reynolds-memorial-bursary |title=News &amp;#124; Adam Reynolds Memorial Bursary |publisher=Shape Arts |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom Heaton had a close friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/adam-reynolds |title=Adam Reynolds: an Obituary |publisher=disability arts online |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early winners were Caroline Cardus, Aaron Williamson, Sally Booth and Noëmi Lakmaier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/Adam-Reynolds-Memorial-Bursary-Shape-The-First-Four |title=Discussion: John O'Donoghue gives an overview of the Shape's Adam Reynolds Memorial Bursary: The First Four |publisher=disability arts online |date=2013-06-14 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also created the Shape Open, an annual open exhibition of artwork by disabled and non-disabled artists created in response to a disability-centred theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shapearts.org.uk/Pages/News/Category/shape-open |title=News &amp;#124; Shape Open |publisher=Shape Arts |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition's patron is [[Yinka Shonibare]], at whose Guest Projects space in Hackney, London the 2016 exhibition took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artlyst.com/articles/yinka-shonibare-to-host-shape-arts-annual-open-exhibition |title=Yinka Shonibare To Host Shape Arts’ Annual Open Exhibition |publisher=Artlyst.com |date=2015-12-17 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eastlondonlines.co.uk/2016/02/yinka-shonibare-hosts-shape-open-exhibition/ |author=Jude Jweihan |title=Yinka Shonibare Hosts Shape Open Exhibition – Eastlondonlines |publisher=Eastlondonlines.co.uk |date=2016-02-10 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heaton has announced that he will stand down as CEO in 2017 and become Chair of the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Trish Wheatley |url=http://disabilityarts.online/magazine/opinion/new-chapter-shape-tony-heaton/ |title=A new chapter for Shape and Tony Heaton - My blog |publisher=Disabilityarts.online |date=2016-11-02 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Order of the British Empire ==
Heaton was awarded an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours, 2013, for services to the arts and the disability arts movement.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/15/queens-birthday-honours-obe |title=Queen's birthday honours list 2013: OBE &amp;#124; UK news |publisher=The Guardian |date=2013-06-14 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seth Riggs at the "Margareta Svensson and Seth Riggs Summer Vocal Workshop" in Varberg, Sweden July 26, 2013.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Vocal coach [[Seth Riggs]] at a 2013 vocal workshop]]
A '''vocal coach''', also known as a '''voice coach''' (though this term often applies to those working with speech and communication rather than singing), is a [[music teacher]], usually a piano accompanist, who helps [[singer]]s prepare for a performance, often also helping them to improve their [[singing]] technique and take care of and develop their voice, but is not the same as a [[voice teacher|singing teacher]] (also called a "voice teacher"). Vocal coaches may give private music lessons or group workshops or [[masterclass]]es to singers. They may also coach singers who are rehearsing on stage, or who are singing during a recording session. Vocal coaches are used in both [[Classical music]] and in [[popular music]] styles such as [[rock (music)|rock]] and [[gospel music|gospel]]. While some vocal coaches provide a range of instruction on singing techniques, others specialize in areas such as breathing techniques or diction and pronunciation.

==Roles==

===Other roles===
A vocal coach is sometimes responsible for writing and producing vocal arrangements for [[four-part harmony]] for backup vocalists or helping to develop [[countermelody|counter melodies]] for a secondary vocalist. Some vocal coaches may also advise singers or bands on lyric-writing for a music production. Some critics allege that in some cases where popular music recordings credit a singer for work as a vocal coach during a recording, this may be a subtle way of acknowledging a [[ghostwriting]] role, in which the coach writes lyrics for a singer-songwriter or rapper.

In the 2000s, the increasing use of recording software which contains vocal processing algorithms and digital pitch correction devices is replacing some of the roles of the vocal coach. In the 1970s, if a producer wanted to record a single with a popular sports star with few vocal skills, the celebrity would need weeks of vocal coaching to learn their song and improve their tone and diction. In the 2000s, the vocals are often processed through pitch correction software instead, and rhythm can be corrected with Pro Tools. This enables 2000s-era producers and audio engineers to in order to make an untrained performer's singing sound closer to that of a trained vocalist.

==Training and experience==
The training and education of vocal coaches vary widely. Many vocal coaches are former or current professional [[singer]]s. Some vocal coaches have extensive formal training, such as a Bachelor of Music, a Master of Music, a Conservatory diploma, or degrees in related areas such as foreign languages or diplomas in human kinetics, posture techniques, or breathing methods. On the other hand, some vocal coaches may have little formal training, and so they rely on their extensive experience as a performer. For example, a native German language speaker who moves to the US may begin providing German diction coaching to amateur vocal students, and over several decades, this vocal coach may develop a broad range of on-the-job experience in coaching German-language singing styles such as [[lieder]] and [[Wagnerian opera]].

Vocal coaches may also come to their profession through other routes, such as related musical professions or from other fields. Some vocal coaches, for example, are rehearsal pianists with decades of experience accompanying singers, or former or current choral, music theater, or symphony conductors. More rarely, vocal coaches may come to the profession from a non-musical route. For example, a specialist in [[Alexander Technique]], [[yoga]], or medical aspects of the throat and vocal cords may begin to specialize in coaching and training singers.

The vocal coaching field is competitive, especially at the highest professional levels. Salaries vary greatly, as do the conditions of work. While a small number of top vocal coaches can command very high hourly or daily rates, most vocal coaches, like most other music and arts professionals, tend to have salaries which are below the average for other professions which require a similar amount of education and experience, such as economists or bank managers. The work conditions vary widely, from part-time or occasional freelance work for individual singers, opera companies, or record companies, to full-time contracts or multi-year jobs for universities (coaching vocal performance students and students in opera courses) or music theater companies.

==Methods of instruction==
While vocal coaches use many different techniques to teach singing, they will usually instruct students in one or more of the following methods:

* Private singing lessons (usually in 30-minute, 45-minute or 60-minute increments)
* Group lessons (this is two or more students working with the vocal coach; for example, a [[barbershop quartet]] might get coaching as a group)
* Recording studio coaching that takes place in a [[recording studio]] with a [[microphone]] and [[multitrack recording]] equipment, which is operated by an [[audio engineer]]. Singing for recordings requires different singing techniques than singing at live shows. To give one example, when a singer is performing at a small [[coffeehouse]] gig without a microphone, she does not need to worry about "plosive" consonants (such as the letter "p"); however, when singing in front of a microphone, words with the letter "p" can be overemphasized by the microphone, due to the nature of the way we produce these sounds.
* Workshops (by definition a workshop involves a number of students and the vocal coach; as well, there may be an audience watching the workshop process)
* Digitally or through online singing lessons (e.g., via [[Skype]] or [[Facetime]]) in which audio or video is transmitted of the instructor singing and the student imitates the instructor. The instructor can also hear the student sing and provide coaching on her or his singing. In most cases, there is a small delay in the audio transmitted during digital voice lessons so the instructor is not able to actively accompany the student. Instead, the voice teacher plays a tone or chord and demonstrates the scale or exercises which he wishes for the student to sing. The student then imitates the instructor. The instructor can then modulate the scale upwards while the student follows singing the same scale pattern.
* [[Accompaniment]] by a pianist is often part of vocal coaching. The vocal coach may double as a vocal coach and as an accompanist. In other cases, the vocal coach may hire an accompanist to play during the coaching sessions. The piano is one of the most common instruments used for accompaniment, as it can be used to play [[bassline]]s, [[chord (music)|chords]] and [[melody|melodies]] at the same time. Other instruments may also be used (e.g., guitar, Hammond organ, etc.) but are less common.

==Nomenclature: vocal coach vs. voice teacher==
Within the community of voice teachers, there has been some debate about the terms "vocal coach" and "[[voice teacher]]".

While many believe the terms are synonymous, some professionals in the music community hold that the terms have slightly different meanings.

The terms "voice teacher" and "singing teacher" are most often used to refer to a teacher that has been educated and instructs [[vocal pedagogy]], while a vocal coach may not possess the same education level.

In universities, for example, it would be rare to have a professor of voice refer to themselves as a vocal coach, even though they may teach private lessons.

Additionally, the term "voice teacher" or "singing teacher" normally refers to an instructor whose main role is developing the singing voice. The term "vocal coach", on the other hand, may be appropriated by someone who works on stage performance, vocal style or a host of other subjects that are related to voice, but not necessarily teach singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.octavehighereast.com/singing-coach/|title=Singing Coach vs Voice Teacher: What's the Difference?|date=2017-07-30|work=Octave Higher East|access-date=2017-07-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wading in the Water''''' is a 2007 [[mixed media]] [[collage]] by artist [[India Cruse-Griffin]] located on the [[Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital|Eskenazi Health]] campus, near downtown [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], and is part of the [[Eskenazi Health Art Collection]].

== Description ==
''Wading in the Water'' is a 2007 [[mixed media]] [[collage]] by artist India Cruse-Griffin, which depicts a young woman in a pink dress in front of a tree-lined bank, waist deep in a body of water, reaching down to grab a fish. The work, which measures 37.25" x 49.25", framed, is made from collaged paper gathered from magazines, upon which Cruse-Griffin then paints, often allowing the underlying magazine paper to show through.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicartarchive.org/work/wading-water|title=Wading in the Water {{!}} Public Art Archive|last=|first=|date=|website=www.publicartarchive.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indiacg.wix.com/artist#!artist-spotlight|title=INDIA CRUSE-GRIFFIN MIXED MEDIA ARTIST {{!}} Wix.com|work=INDIA CRUSE-GRIFFIN MIXED MEDIA ARTIST|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; While her subjects are often clear and straightforward, this collage technique serves as a reminder of the accumulation of lived experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Biography==
=== Education ===
William Stout grew up in [[Los Angeles, California]], and earned a full scholarship to the [[Chouinard Art Institute]]. He graduated with a bachelor's degree from the school (which at that point had become the [[California Institute of the Arts]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

=== Comics and music industry===
[[File:Who's Zoo.jpg|thumb|''Who's Zoo'', a [[The Who]] [[bootleg recording]] with cover artwork by William Stout.]]
Stout began his professional career as an illustrator for [[comic books]] and [[graphic novels]], with his first job coming in 1968 with the cover for the first issue of the [[pulp magazine]] ''Coven 13''. In 1971 he worked as [[Russ Manning]]'s assistant on Manning's ''[[Tarzan (comics)|Tarzan of the Apes]]'' Sunday and daily [[comic strip|newspaper comic strips]]. In 1972, Stout worked for [[Harvey Kurtzman]] and [[Will Elder]] on ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'''s ''[[Little Annie Fanny]]''.

In 1973 Stout began drawing album covers for the [[Trademark of Quality]] [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] record label.  He created 42 sleeves for the label and its subsidiaries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wimwords.com/2018/02/02/from-the-stacks-rolling-stones-all-meat-music-and-a-william-stout-interview/|title=From The Stacks: Rolling Stones, ‘All-Meat Music’ ( and a William Stout Interview!)|date=2018-02-02|work=Why It Matters|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, including [[the Rolling Stones]]' ''All-Meat Music'' (his first), [[the Yardbirds]]' ''Golden Eggs'' and ''More Golden Eggs'', and [[the Who]]'s ''Who's Zoo'' and ''Tales from the Who''.  He became associated with the [[Firesign Theatre]], and designed his first official album sleeve, ''[[In the Next World, You're on Your Own]]'', in 1974.&lt;ref name="rc"&gt;Randy Fox, "Tales from the Boots: the album art of William Stout", ''[[Record Collector]]'', no.418, September 2013, pp.132-135&lt;/ref&gt; Stout also designed the original [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] logo in 1978.

From 1975 to 1977 Stout worked as art director for the [[rock and roll|rock]] magazine ''[[Bomp!]]'' During this time, he became one of the first American contributors to ''[[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]]'' magazine.  He continued to work occasionally designing posters and album sleeves.  These included the poster for ''[[Rock 'n' Roll High School]]'' featuring [[the Ramones]] in 1979, the controversial cover for the compilation album ''[[Beatlesongs]]'' in 1981,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rutlemania.org/lean3.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rutlemania.org/rhpr1.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; http://www.rutlemania.org/rhpr2.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; http://www.rutlemania.org/rhpr3.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the cover for ''[[The Smithereens Play Tommy]]'' in 2009.&lt;ref name="rc"/&gt;

=== Film and television ===
In 1977 Stout painted his first movie poster, for [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s film ''[[Wizards (film)|Wizards]]''. During his career, Stout has worked on the advertising for over 120 films.

In 1978, with ''[[Buck Rogers#Film and television adaptations|Buck Rogers]]'', Stout began his film production design career. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Stout and fellow illustrator [[Richard Hescox]] ran a Los Angeles art studio, working on such projects as the storyboards for ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' and pop singer [[Michael Jackson]]'s video "[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]". Fellow cartoonist [[Dave Stevens]] worked for a time in the same studio.&lt;ref name="stout"&gt;[http://www.williamstout.com/news/journal/archives/00000058.shtml "Dave Stevens, 1955-2008," The Worlds of William Stout (Mar. 11, 2008).] Accessed Oct. 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stout has worked on over thirty feature films, including both [[Conan the Barbarian#Films|Conan]] films, ''[[First Blood]]'', ''[[The Hitcher (1986 film)|The Hitcher]]'', and ''[[Invaders from Mars (1986 film)|Invaders From Mars]]''. He was also the production designer of the ''[[Masters of the Universe (film)|Masters of the Universe]]'' film.

Stout illustrated the poster art and wrote the story (and the first draft of the script) of the film ''[[The Warrior and the Sorceress]]'' for [[Roger Corman]], as well as writing a never-produced dinosaur feature for [[Jim Henson]]. For [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] in 1996, he designed "Edgar", the big bug in ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]''. Stout was the key character designer for the computer-animated feature ''[[Dinosaur (film)|Dinosaur]]'' (released in 2000). Stout worked as the conceptual designer for ''[[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]]'', and key designer for [[Guillermo del Toro]]'s ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]''. Recent film work includes [[Christopher Nolan]]'s  film ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' and creature design for [[Frank Darabont]]'s &amp; [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Mist (film)|The Mist]]''. He is slated to work on del Toro's ''[[At the Mountains of Madness#Film, TV or theatrical adaptations|At the Mountains of Madness]]'' as well as a proposed [[John Carter of Mars]] film.

=== Paleontological art ===
In 1981 Bantam Books published Stout's landmark masterwork ''The Dinosaurs: A Fantastic New View of a Lost Era'' (recently updated and re-published as ''The New Dinosaurs''). In 1983, Stout was among those who illustrated [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Dinosaur Tales]]''. In 1984 he illustrated ''[[The Little Blue Brontosaurus]]'', which was a 1984 Children's Choice Award recipient and the basis for the 1988 animated feature ''[[The Land Before Time]]''.

In 1986, as a result of his paleontological reconstruction work, eleven Stout paintings were selected for inclusion in the traveling exhibition "Dinosaurs Past and Present," an important group show depicting the history of [[paleoart]]. The six-year tour included (among others) the [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[British Museum]], the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], and the [[American Museum of Natural History]].

In 1993, [[Universal Cartoon Studios]] chose Stout to design a prime-time [[Jurassic Park#Cancelled animated series|animated series of ''Jurassic Park'']], which was ultimately shelved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williamstout.com/news/journal/?p=3518|title=My Top Ten Favorite Dinosaur Films – Part One|website=WilliamStout.com|date=April 26, 2014|accessdate=July 12, 2015|first=William|last=Stout}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1993 [[Comic Images]] released ''William Stout's Lost Worlds'', the first of three [[trading card]] sets.

==== Antarctica ====
In January 1989, Stout traveled to [[Antarctica]] and [[Patagonia]]. His experiences there eventually resulted in the one-man show "Dinosaurs, Penguins and Whales — The Wildlife of Antarctica." The exhibition was part of Stout's effort to alert and inform the public of the complex beauty of Antarctica, and to work as part of the international effort to make Antarctica the first "World Park." "Dinosaurs, Penguins and Whales" evolved into a forthcoming book, ''Lost Worlds: Modern and Prehistoric Life in Antarctica'', the first visual overview of life in Antarctica.

In August 1991 Stout received a grant from the [[National Science Foundation]] to participate in their Antarctic Artists and Writers Program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/aawrws.jsp National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs.] Accessed Oct. 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; For three months during the 1992-1993 austral summer, Stout was based at [[McMurdo Station]] and [[Palmer Station]]. He made several dives beneath the ice, climbed the active volcano [[Mt. Erebus]], camped in the dry valleys, and produced over one hundred painted studies as he carefully observed Antarctica's wildlife. Shortly thereafter, Stout drove over one thousand miles through central southern [[Chile]], documenting the rare prehistoric forests there for inclusion in his ''Lost Worlds'' book.

==== Murals ====
In 1994 Stout painted two murals for the [[Houston Museum of Natural Science]] depicting "Life Before The Dinosaurs." In early 1998 Stout completed three [[Cretaceous]] murals and supervised two full-sized dinosaur sculptures for [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]]. &lt;!-- Stout worked in 1998-1999 as the lead designer for Toronto's [[Dinotopia]] theme park. --&gt;

In 2007, Stout completed twelve large murals depicting the prehistoric life of San Diego for the [[San Diego Natural History Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Milner, Richard. "Art for the Ages: New Murals offer a glimpse of the Pacific Coast's extinct ecosystems," ''Natural History'' magazine (March 2008), pp. 51-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Stout's murals and paintings are on permanent display at the [[Houston Museum of Natural Science]], the [[Orton Geological Museum]], The [[Museum of the Rockies]], and the [[North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences]].

=== Entertainment design ===
Beginning in 1987, Stout worked for [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] for a year and a half as a conceptualist, designer, and producer for [[Euro Disneyland]], [[Disneyland]], [[Tokyo Disneyland]], and [[Walt Disney World]]. In 1989 he was hired by [[Lucasfilm]]/Industrial Light and Magic as conceptualist and chief designer for their first foray into themed entertainment centers. In 1991 Stout conceived and designed [[ZZ Top]]'s ''[[Recycler (album)|Recycler]]'' tour. In 1994 Stout continued theme park attraction creation and design for [[MCA Inc.|MCA]]/[[Universal Studios|Universal]]'s [[Islands of Adventure]]. In late 1995, [[Steven Spielberg]] chose Stout as his senior concept designer for [[GameWorks]], a [[Sega]]/[[Universal Studios|Universal]]/[[DreamWorks SKG]] joint project. For two years Stout and his team oversaw the concepts, design, and execution of the first three GameWorks facilities in Seattle, Washington; Tempe, Arizona; and Ontario, California). Stout worked in 1998-1999 as the lead designer for Kansas City's Wonderful World of Oz theme park (which unfortunately was never developed). He was also a designer for [[Michael Jackson]]'s private [[Neverland Ranch]] theme park.

=== Illustration ===
In 2001, Stout illustrated [[Richard Matheson]]'s first children's book, ''Abu &amp; The 7 Marvels'', which won many awards. The Stout-illustrated book ''[[The Emerald Wand of Oz]]'' was released in 2005, followed by ''[[Trouble Under Oz]]'' in 2006. Stout's own publishing company, [[Terra Nova Press]], has published thirty-four books on art and the history of art.

In 2013, he prepared and illustrated ''Legends of the Blues'', a book comprising portraits of classic [[blues]] musicians, intended as a sequel to fellow cartoonist [[Robert Crumb]]'s book ''Heroes of Blues, Jazz and Country''.&lt;ref name="rc"/&gt;

{{World Cinema}}

'''World cinema''' is not the sum-total of all films made around the world. Its use is analogous to the use of the term "world literature". Goethe used the concept of [[World literature|''Weltliteratur'']] (world literature) in several of his essays in the early decades of the nineteenth century to describe the international circulation and reception of literary works in Europe, including works of non-Western origin. An interest in "world cinema" suggests an awareness of high-quality films made outside the Hollywood studio system which dominates international viewership. However, some people use the term to refer to the [[film]] and [[film industry|film industries]] of non-English-speaking countries in English-speaking countries. Equating the dominant form of cinema with the dominant language (English) can be inherently problematic.There are many countries such as Canada, England, South Africa and even Asian countries like India, where films are made in English but they are part of "world cinema" due to their marginal status in terms of access or viewership. It can be argued that an understanding of "world cinema" centering around Hollywood cinema suggests an [[Eurocentric]] view. "World cinema" is often used interchangeably with the term '''foreign film'''. "Foreign" is also a relative term, suggesting a Western viewpoint. One person's national cinema can be another person's foreign film. In fact, American [[Independent film|independent cinema]] may be considered part of "world cinema" as it does not have adequate access. 

Technically, ''foreign film'' does not mean the same as ''foreign language film'', but the inference is that a foreign film is not only foreign in terms of the country of production, but also in terms of the language used.  As such, the use of the term ''foreign film'' for films produced in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada or other English-speaking countries would be uncommon within other English-speaking countries. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Types==
World cinema has an unofficial implication of films with "artistic value" as opposed to "Hollywood commercialism." Foreign language films are often grouped with "[[Art film|art house films]]" and other [[independent film]]s in DVD stores, cinema listings etc.
Unless dubbed into one's native language, foreign language films played in English-speaking regions usually have English [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]]. Few films of this kind receive more than a limited release and many are never played in major cinemas. As such the marketing, popularity and gross takings for these films are usually markedly less than for typical Hollywood [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]]. The combination of subtitles and minimal exposure adds to the notion that "World Cinema" has an inferred artistic prestige or intelligence, which may discourage less sophisticated viewers. Additionally, differences in cultural style and tone between foreign and domestic films affects attendance at cinemas and DVD sales.&lt;ref name="Curran 500"&gt;Curran, Daniel. ''Foreign Films: More than 500 films on video cassette,'' pages v-vi. Evanston, Illinois: CineBooks, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign language films can be commercial, [[Low culture|low brow]] or [[B-movie]]s. Furthermore, foreign language films can cross cultural boundaries, particularly when the visual spectacle and style is sufficient to overcome people's misgivings. Films of this type became more common in the early 2000s, as ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'', ''[[Amélie]]'',  ''[[Brotherhood of the Wolf]]'', ''[[Y Tu Mama Tambien]]'' and ''[[Talk to Her]]'' enjoyed great successes in United States cinemas and [[home video]] sales. The first foreign and foreign language film to top the North American [[box office]] was ''[[Hero (movie)|Hero]]'' in August 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Hero' Soars to Late August Record|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=1445&amp;p=.htm|work=boxofficemojo.com|author=Brandon Gray|date=August 29, 2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004023456/http://boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=1445&amp;p=.htm|archivedate=October 4, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The rule for foreign-language films is that if you've done $5 million or better (in United States cinemas), you've had a very nice success; if you do $10 (million) or better (in United States cinemas), you're in blockbuster category," [[Warner Independent Pictures]] ex-president Mark Gill said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703133158/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000724461|title=Foreign affairs|date=3 July 2009|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, English-dubbed foreign films rarely did well in United States box office (except [[Anime]] films).  The 1982 United States theatrical release of Wolfgang Peterson’s ''[[Das Boot]]'' was the last major release to go out in both original and English-dubbed versions, and the film's original version actually grossed much higher than the English-dubbed version&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/1999/08/editorial-life-isnt-beautiful-anymore-its-dubbed-82123/|title=EDITORIAL: Life Isn’t Beautiful Anymore, it’s Dubbed|date=23 August 1999|website=Indiewire.com|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20180805152511/https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/19/business/will-dubbing-fly-in-the-us-read-my-lips.html?gwh=5B7FDE5A22B394D810DA99A95EFCDECB&amp;gwt=pay|title=Will Dubbing Fly in the U.S.?

Later on, English-dubbed versions of international hits like ''[[Un indien dans la ville]]'', ''[[Godzilla 2000]]'', ''[[Anatomy (film)|Anatomy]]'', ''[[Pinocchio (2002 film)|Pinocchio]]'' and ''[[High Tension]]'' flopped at United States box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1996/04/02/little-indian-big-mistake/be40c0e7-fbb7-42ba-aa35-8481c485f29a/?utm_term=.3e5fbdab6cf5&amp;noredirect=on|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180718041749/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1996/04/02/little-indian-big-mistake/be40c0e7-fbb7-42ba-aa35-8481c485f29a/?utm_term=.3e5fbdab6cf5&amp;noredirect=on|deadurl=yes|title=LITTLE INDIAN': BIG MISTAKE - The Washington Post|date=18 July 2018|archivedate=18 July 2018|website=Archive.today|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeguru.com/082100.htm|title=Weekend Box Office|first=Gitesh|last=Pandya|website=Boxofficeguru.com|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/07/entertainment/et-horn7|title='Pinocchio' will try again, in Italian|first=John|last=Horn|date=7 February 2003|website=Articles.latimes.com|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2009/10/girl-with-dragon-tattoo-gets-u-s-release-239436/|title=Girl with Dragon Tattoo Gets U.S. Release|first=Anne|last=Thompson|date=11 October 2009|website=Indiewire.com|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   When Miramax planned to release the English-dubbed versions of ''[[Shaolin Soccer]]'' and ''[[Hero (movie)|Hero]]'' in the United States cinemas, their English-dubbed versions scored badly in test screenings in the United States, so Miramax finally released the films in United States cinemas with their original language.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Xu|first=Gary G.|title=Sinascape: Contemporary Chinese Cinema|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|year=2007|page=44|isbn=0742554503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''wrap dress''' is a [[dress]] with a front closure formed by wrapping one side across the other, and knotting the attached ties that wrap around the back at the waist or fastening buttons. This forms a V-shaped neckline and hugs the wearer's curves. A '''faux wrap dress''' resembles this design, except that it comes already fastened together with no opening in front, but instead is slipped on over the head. A '''wrap top''' is a [[Top (clothing)|top]] cut and constructed in the same way as a wrap dress, but without a skirt.

==History==
[[File:Till boken - utställningen Kunglig Vintage - Livrustkammaren - 87644.tif|thumb|left|100px|1960s wrap dress: the navy bindings highlight the wrap-over.]]
Although it is often claimed that [[Diane von Fürstenberg]] 'invented' the wrap dress in 1972/73,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Grufferman |first=Barbara Hannah|title=The Wrap Star: Why Diane Von Fürstenberg Is Still On A Roll |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/barbara-hannah-grufferman/the-wrap-star-why-diane-von-furstenberg_b_1281376.html|accessdate=13 January 2014|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Martin (curator)|Richard Martin]], a former curator of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art#The Costume Institute|Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art]], noted that the form of Fürstenberg's design had already been "deeply embedded into the American designer [[sportswear (fashion)|sportswear]] tradition," with her choice of elastic, synthetic fabrics distinguishing her work from earlier wrap dresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Martin |first=Richard |title=American ingenuity : sportswear, 1930s - 1970s|year=1998|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |location=New York |isbn=9780870998638 |page=35 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ByvsBRNapAC&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Great Depression, house dresses called "Hooverettes" were popular which employed a wrap design.

The Fürstenberg interpretation of the wrap dress, which was consistently knee-length, in a clinging [[jersey (fabric)|jersey]], with long sleeves, was so popular and so distinctive that the style has generally become associated with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amanda-christine-miller/diane-von-furstenberg-on-_b_81590.html |first=Amanda Christine |last=Miller |date=January 16, 2008 |title=Diane von Fürstenberg On Wrap Dresses And The Joys Of Aging Gracefully |work=Huffington Post |accessdate=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="voguepedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vogue.com/voguepedia/Diane_von_Furstenberg |title=Diane von Fürstenberg |deadurl=no |accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/designers/diane-von-frstenberg/ |title=Diane von Fürstenberg |work=Fashion Model Directory |accessdate=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has stated that her divorce inspired the design,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Diane von Fürstenberg Wrap Dress Inspired By Designer's Divorce|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/09/diane-von-furstenberg-wra_n_2103096.html|publisher=Huff Post|accessdate=4 February 2013|first=Kelsey|last=Borresen|date=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also suggested it was created in the spirit of enabling women to enjoy sexual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walden|first=Celia|title=Diane von Fürstenberg: interview|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG8430291/Diane-von-Furstenberg-interview.html|accessdate=13 January 2014|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=6 April 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 a book dedicated entirely to Fürstenberg's wrap dresses was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Talley|first=André Leon|title=Diane von Fürstenberg : the wrap|year=2004|publisher=Assouline|location=New York, NY|isbn=9782843235245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wrap dresses achieved their peak of popularity in the mid to late 1970s, and the design has been credited with becoming a symbol of [[women's liberation]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/wrap-superstar-designer-diane-von-furstenberg-tells-her-story-801189.html |title=Wrap superstar: Designer Diane von Fürstenberg tells her story |date=March 27, 2008 |work=The Independent on Sunday |accessdate=June 27, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanenbaum"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Leora Tanenbaum]]|title=Because of Slut-Shaming, the Wrap Dress Still Matters|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leora-tanenbaum/because-of-slut-shaming-the-wrap-dress-still-matters_b_7769476.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=July 15, 2015|date=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They experienced renewed popularity beginning in the late 1990s, particularly after von Fürstenberg reintroduced her wrap dress in 1997; she, among others, has continued to design wrap dresses since then.&lt;ref name="voguepedia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKean|first=Erin|title=The Hundred Dresses: The Most Iconic Styles of Our Time |year=2013 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=New York|isbn=9781608199761|page=201|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pRxpwEHPLA4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA201#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|authorlink=Erin McKean|accessdate=May 6, 2013|quote="Revived in 1997, the dress again sold in the millions."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wrap dress's popularity and its perceived [[feminist]] significance have remained current into the mid-2010s.&lt;ref name="Tanenbaum" /&gt;
